November 2023,Above and beyond,"Hotel 41 is the epitome of a boutique hotel. If you're looking for an intimate experience, Hotel 41 is sure to meet your expectations. From the moment we walked in the door, every staff made sure we were welcomed and made to feel special and a priority. From a champagne greeting to afternoon tea to evening noshes, we couldn't possibly have ever have gone hungry or thirsty. When we went sight seeing, they prepared a goody bag for us to take along. We had an evening spent in their theater room for a movie, popcorn, and sweet treats. What an experience on such an elegantly, well appointed hotel. I watched one staff polish a door to a high shine and was so impressed - he didn't just wipe it down, he really got it to shine! That to me conveyed what Hotel 41 is all about: commitment…"
August 2023,A delightful experience in London !,"This is one of the very best luxury hotels ever ! The location, furniture, quality of beverages and food were awesome. But the very best of all is the team, everyone was very helpful and friendly, principally Eder. Thank u very much Eder ! For making us feel at home. Hope see u soon ! : )"
November 2023,If you are looking for somewhere to stay for a special occasion this is the place.,The best hotel we have stayed in when in London …. The staff and the atmosphere were amazing. We were staying for a very special anniversary and they did everything to make sure it was special. The rooms are superb and comfortable and the food provided was amazing.
November 2023,Another stay another WOW,"It wasnt the first stay at the Hotel 41 and for sure not the last. I travel alot around the world. I‘ve seen many really great hotels but the crew of the 41 really achieved the highest level of service quality. Whats unique whats different to others? The attention to detail! Everyone knows your name / they really invest time to get to know you / they really wanna give you a unique experience. I‘m a gay traveller usually there is no need to mention this fact but this time it is. After the turndown service we received slippers by the bedside with a bag stiched with His or Hers (thats what my parents received) we, both men, receiced twice His. That kind of attention that feeling of beeing taken care of was really unique. It touched my heart on a really special way and will stay…"
November 2023,Business trip ,"Came for a business trip and had a brilliant stay! Couldn’t recommend this hotel more, was lovely to come back to such a clean and welcoming environment after a long days work. Staff were also brilliant! Will be staying again "
November 2023,PERFECT AT ALL,It is not necessary to write more than everything is PERFECT there. There was nothing less than perfect at this excellent boutique Hotel. It was 3 days stay and the whole family says the same thing We'll visit London again but stay there absolutely.
October 2023,The Definition of Excellence in London!,"To these well-travelled guests, Hotel 41 is the new standard-bearer for the five-star experience. We have stayed in larger hotels, more expensive hotels, and newer, hipper hotels, but my wife and I have never experienced such sincere, friendly, and genuine hospitality and effortless comfort and luxury as we received on a recent nine-night stay in London.  Hotel 41 is run as a private hotel with only 28 rooms and a central lounge that functions as social club, dining room and lobby, which lends the whole affair an air of intimacy and exclusivity. However, it is the meticulously trained and knowledgeable staff that makes one’s stay truly exceptional and memorable. They really get to know their guests, and always endeavor to delight with kindness and professionalism that borders on…"
October 2023,An intimate gem in the heart of Westminster,"We visit London regularly and were delighted to discover Hotel 41. It is a boutique hotel with limited rooms in the heart of Westminster - a stones throw from Buckingham Palace. The rooms were clean and spacious. The staff was professional, efficient, and friendly. Meals were a delight in the beautiful main lounge area. Guests are pampered by the service and availability of snacks and other goodies in the pantry area. We would highly recommend Hotel 41 and definitely plan to book our next stay there."
October 2023,"Excellent, as always!","Once again I’ve had the pleasure of staying at 41.  From the welcome when I walked through the door, the ambience, service and sheer quality of the establishment were so satisfying. Having arrived and sat down to drinks and canapés, we settled down in the Executive Lounge after our journey, before heading to our  rooms close by to relax before going out for the evening meal.  The Turn-down service ensured that, having had my luggage taken to my room, and having freshened-up before going for dinner, the bed was warmed by a hot-water bottle, the fire was burning and music was playing upon my return.  Adele, the Resident Manager and her staff catered to our every need, with Gabriel attentively making sure that our drinks were topped up.  Having slept so well, we were greeted by the…"
October 2023,Great Vacation,"We thoroughly enjoyed our recent stay at Hotel 41.  Every staff member that we came in contact with was ever so helpful.  I would like to thank Nishan for all the work he did prior to our arrival.  He recommended and arranged all of our tours, restaurants reservations, shows, etc., and secured the tickets prior to our arrival. His expertise was invaluable.  Our morning breakfast was handled expertly by Shadrack; he was efficient and an absolute delight. Throughout the day we were greeted by Esin who was most helpful and so pleasant and sweet.  We cannot say enough wonderful words of praise for the staff. The hotel facility is lovely.  It is truly an oasis when you want to escape the hustle and bustle of London.  It is beautiful, clean, and tranquil."
February 2023,"An introduction that went really, really well.....","Three of us checked in to 41 – two of us as regular returnees and one as a new guest – to kick back and relax.  Dean had coordinated the new booking seamlessly and was there to greet us. From the outset, our friend was impressed with the efficiency and outstanding, welcoming service that we know is the heartbeat of 41.    Another success was our supper reservation at The Curry Room downstairs. Read a separate review for that excellent meal.  No need to venture outside on a cold night. Just sign your bill to the room.      Plunder the Pantry on Saturday night was the acid test after a delightful lunch at The Wolesley followed by a long walk.  He loved that evening’s offering of pork pies, cheese, and pickle jars, and went back for seconds of the mac'n'cheese.  And this was after…"
February 2023,"Lovely hotel, great location, outstanding service.","We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in February 2023. Good room, great location, but most impressive- outstanding service from every single staff member.  Helpful, courteous and knowledgeable, from the chambermaid to the manager. Fabulous!"
February 2023,Best hotel stay ever,"This Hotel and the staff are simply unbelievable! From the moment we walked through the door to the moment we had to leave I cannot describe what a fab stay we had. Unforgettable and we will return!   The service, complementary food, the room, the location - everything was simply perfect and made our anniversary stay so special.  Thank you!"
December 2022,The Best!!,"I would recommend Hotel 41 for all the obvious reasons - the best location in London, rooms, amenities, exceptional service and most importantly; value for money. I have stayed at Hotel 41 previously and most recently stayed at the hotel during the end of December 2022. It is what you would expect from a 5 star hotel - absolutely no faults. But, what sets Hotel 41 apart from other hotels are the amazing staff. They make the experience of staying at this hotel truly memorable - they are always friendly, extremely attentive, and clearly the best at what they do. Nothing was too much trouble for them and the smallest of details matter, from arrival to check out. Thanks again to Adele, Marlen, Dean and Dermo that were willing to go out of their way to make it an unforgettable…"
January 2023,Best 5-star hotel,"My wife claimed to be speechless when we entered our room at Hotel 41, but the superlatives kept coming.  From the very discreet entrance near Buckingham Palace to the check-in process (with complimentary drinks and food) to the executive lounge, the facilities are luxurious and the staff professional and extremely friendly.  The list of things they can help you with is long and includes packing your belongings prior to checkout.  The hotel is located in a very nice area of London within short distance of places to visit and a 2-minute walk from an underground station.  A stay at Hotel 41 is a lifetime memory and it is the best 5-star hotel we have visited."
January 2023,Lovely stay,"Everyone we met was so lovely. They remembered everything about us, couldn’t be more helpful and were very attentive. Wish we were there longer than 1 night. The room was really nice and the little touches like the candle in the bathroom made it extra special. "
January 2023,Incredible ,"We had our trip gifted to us for Christmas and it’s safe to say we will most definitely be back. The whole stay from the moment we checked in and felt like Luxury. The staff are phenomenal and cannot do enough. There is so many fabulous touches, the candles and petals in the room, the complimentary pantry, scones, ice cream. Not a single bad word to say as the hotel was incredible. We are looking forward to coming back to experience the pure luxury again! "
January 2023,The Perfect Stay in London,"Hotel 41 was the perfect stay in London. From check in to check out, every need and question was catered to. The staff was unbelievably friendly and really went out of their way to make my stay extra special. All the small noticeable touches were so lovely, especially the turn down service, what a lovely way to get ready for sleep. The executive lounge was such a beautiful spot to sit outside of the room and socialize with other guests. All the food, from afternoon scones, to plunder the pantry, and all the treats available all day long, the canapés, there was literally not a single moment to feel hungry. The breakfast was top notch. I don’t have a single complaint about my stay and cannot wait to return in the near future."
December 2022,Amazing service at Hotel 41,"We stayed at Hotel 41 in late December and I have to say that I have never experienced more attentive service. From the moment we arrived the staff were  super eager to help. We arrived on an early flight from Australia and  started with complimentary champagne and an excellent breakfast by the fire. They had our room ready soon after breakfast - something I really appreciated after such a long flight.   Hotel 41 is a boutique hotel - it is not large and aside from your room there is one main area that is used for reception and food service, as well as a smaller room used for reading or to host large tables for meals. After a small issue with the bath tub we were upgraded to suite. Stay in one of these if you can - it was beautiful. Our previous room was lovely and had…"
November 2022,Perfect London hideaway,"Lovely, comfortable hotel with flexible eating arrangements and a good linked bar/restaurant next door.   Very friendly and capable staff.   Extremely dog-friendly.   My late husband and I were regulars through and after lockdown and now that I am on my own I am totally comfortable there and made to feel welcome rather than an inconvenience as in some hotels.   Previously we used to stay at the Milestone, a sister hotel, also first class but Hotel 41 now suits me better.   Perfect."
March 2023,Very Warm Welcome,"How great to return to your room in the middle of winter with the gas fireplace glowing. With all our previous stays at the amazing Hotel 41, this is the first time our room came with a fireplace. We loved the warm, cozy atmosphere the fireplace created in our room. Although every room and suite can be very different, although they all have the famed black and white design theme.   Of course, hospitality and service by this caring team are still second to none. With the departure of former resident manager Lauren, the resident team of everyone including Dean and Marlen went out of their way to ensure we enjoyed everything and left with smiles on our faces. Thanks Adele for the goody bag of treats for our travels to Birmingham. This is the the only place we will stay when…"
March 2023,Incredible hotel ,Absolutely awesome hotel. Cannot fault it at all. Pure luxury. Customer service is the best I’ve ever experienced. Special mention to James. Complete maturity and professionalism from a 20 year old. Cannot wait for my next trip here. 
March 2023,"41 is a jewel amongst hotels in London,","I am very spoilt when it comes to hotels. Since I'm a german Lifestyle-journalist who used to traveling the world.  I know a lot of hot spots already.   ...but what shall I say.... Hotel 41 is unique in every kind of a way. The extras like complementary sweets, the plunder the pantry-service. The VIP service for every ! guest (not only for the Very v's) ,. The very private atmosphere. the high-end decor and surrounding. It feels like (I guess)  a little bit like being part of the movie Downtown Abbey, spending time in a Castle, not in an hotel . Feeling like a Duchess in front of the fire place drinking tea and eating scones. Served by so wonderful, high professional , lovely members of the staff of 41. Unfortunately I forgot the names since, but I remember Esin, what a…"
March 2023,The best city hotel there is.,The most wonderful experience.  A rare solo trip for two days and was welcomed and treated like an old friend.  The staff are all wonderful.  Was given a surprise upgrade to the magnificent monarch suite which made this tired travelled immediately relaxed and refreshed.  It’s the best breakfast I’ve ever had and the executive lounge is relaxing at any time of the day.  Wonderful experience and can’t wait to come back.
June 2023,Staff made us feel truly welcome,"Lovely stay.  The hotel staff went above and beyond, and made for a memorable London experience.   We enjoyed spending time in the lounge and on the rooftop patio, both of which were great places to relax after a day of exploring the city.  Highly recommend."
May 2023,Beyond expectations!!,"Outstanding facility all the way around.  Covered us up with smiling service, consistently, and everyone was a delight to be around.  The room was very clean and we were gifted champagne for our anniversary.  Dermo went above and beyond and arranged for packages to be mailed back home.  There are many good reasons that it's the #1 hotel in London.  We're so glad to have stayed with them."
June 2023,Exquisite is an understatement!  ,We have never experienced this type of uniquely refined experience and attention anywhere!  From the time you step your foot into the door you are treated like the King and Queen of England--truly.  Attention to detail at every turn.  Hotel 41 is a charming old English experience without being pretentious.  Treat yourself - it is worth it!
May 2023,Authentic hospitality like we’ve never experienced before,"41 Hotel - where do I start. We’ve stayed at most of the top London hotels so were greatly looking forward to this experience.  The hotel is located on a busy road just a stones throw from Buckingham Palace with many traffic restrictions so we were a little nervous about arriving by car. Luckily the hotel had thought of everything and had sent a detailed information mail in advance outlying their services to assist the guest experience. We alerted them to our arrival so a helpful and cheerful valet was already waiting for us to whisk the car away. When you enter the ground floor lobby, you are transported away from the tourist chaos outside in an instant to a calm and opulent oasis. You are greeted by Marble floors,  wood panelled walls and chandeliers. The friendly staff member…"
May 2023,Relaxing Stop to End Long Trip,"The staff is especially responsive, the service prompt, the rooms are charming, the hotel's location is central to key London sights, the martinis are perfect and the ice cream is delightful for a late-night snack."
May 2023,Outstanding hotel even better staff.,"This was our third visit and everything was simply outstanding as usual.   My partner had booked us a room last minute as a treat for my birthday and we were massively surprised to find that we had been upgraded when we were shown to our room.   From the complimentary glass of champagne during the booking in process through to the open pantry and cheese and ham toasties before dinner and the fantastic choice of snacks until 01:00 hrs you just can’t fault what’s on offer, but the thing that makes the hotel so special is the staff!   Every single member of the team go over and above to make you feel so very special and have so much time for you.   The hotel itself is ideally located for the normal touristy things…Buckingham Palace is your next door neighbour and Hamilton is…"
May 2023,I was treated like royalty,Everything about Hotel 41 is excellent. The comfortable rooms and bed and the fantastic service. From the moment I arrived to my departure I loved every minute. We discovered this hotel many years ago and I had not returned for several years and found that this property has aged well and if anything the service has improved which is hard to believe. They do have rooms with a shower and I have a hard time getting in and out of a bath. I will return again.
May 2023,Weekend break ,"A hidden gem. No bar or restaurant, just the 'executive lounge' which is the hub, where guests are welcomed (with champagne and canapés) and where you can relax, it's also where breakfast is served.  The benefit feels like a quiet private member's club , where you can leave  the hustle and bustle of central London outside,perfect if you don't want a really busy hotel with lobby, lots of other people around.  The downside is a slight feeling of claustrophobia due to the narrow entrance and narrow corridors and the one small social space. To be fair, there is a secret door that leads into next door Reubans Hotel, where there are great bar's and restaurants to choose from, which adds to the exclusive feel of going back to hotel 41 as a nice separate space.The service is impeccable…"
May 2023,Best London Hotel,Having never visited London we wanted a hotel with great reviews that was central to the major sites. You cannot go wrong staying here. Amazing service and food and comfortable rooms with everything you need!! And the staff could not be more responsive or pleasant! We couldn’t be happier with our stay at Hotel 41!!!
May 2023,Amazing,"Second time here and I have to say the place is unreal, from the minute you step in the door to the minute you  leave, the service goes above and beyond.  The welcome glass of champagne before you even check in, was a great start. Stunning room, amazing breakfast and top quality staff."
March 2023,Can’t recommend highly enough,"I can’t praise this hotel enough. Probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in for lots of reasons, and I’ve stayed in some of the best hotels around the world. It’s basically a boutique hotel with 28 rooms. There’s no standing around to check in at a reception desk, they come to you with an iPad while you’re enjoying your welcome drink and some well thought out nibbles in a gorgeous cosy gentlemen’s club like lounge area. In this same room they have an array of complimentary food day and night and a fully stocked paid bar. They are open 24hours. You also get your breakfast there which was delicious. We were upgraded (no idea why) to a suite that had a free mini bar, sky tv and a gas real flame fire that they put on for us that evening. The small group of staff couldn’t be more…"
February 2023,Totally pampered,"From the moment you enter the Hotel 41 you are treated with incredible service. There is   amazing attention to detail which makes the stay so memorable. The highlight for me was coming back to the room after a long, tiring and chilly February day in London and finding a hot water bottle in the bed. Bliss! "
February 2023,Wonderful Stay,I had a wonderful stay at Hotel 41. My room was very comfortable and I really appreciated the little surprise touches for my birthday. The service from the staff was exceptional; everyone was friendly and made sure I had everything I needed. One of the best breakfasts I’ve ever had and ‘Plunder the Pantry’ was great to return to after an evening out. I can’t wait for my next stay.
February 2023,A cocoon of calm in the heart of London,"We love this gem of a hotel - it is instantly soothing, from the refreshing water on arrival, to the gorgeous scents and chic black and white decor. The beds are divinely comfortable, all the better to flop into after ""plundering the pantry""! The staff are friendly and give you really personal service. We hope to be back again!"
February 2023,A little gem hidden in the city!,"I cannot fault this amazing hotel. It was an oasis of calm in the middle of the city! Every member of staff were exceptional, making us feel so welcome and anticipating our evert need. Being a small hotel made such a difference as you were made to feel very special. The rooms were spotless and very comfortable. We had such a lovely relaxing stay here and we will most certainly go back."
March 2022,A true 5 star hotel,"Late review but I had to show appreciation when I remembered.  From the hotel doorman and entrance hall, to the lounge and room, everything was magnificent.  Lounge had a complimentary sweet bar and fridge stocked with ice cream for guests and we were welcomed with a glass of champagne. Full English breakfast was one of the best we’ve had and very generous.  Room was small but very nice with comfortable bed and nice touch of lavender pillow spray for us to use and take home. Also a surprise birthday cake for my husbands 30th.  All staff were friendly and accommodating without being overbearing, no snobby staff who haven’t got the time of day and look down on you here.  We loved this hotel and would definitely visit again, it’s the perfect place for a special occasion or just…"
October 2023,No better place in London to stay,"This was our 10th stay at Hotel 41 since 2013.  It only gets the better with each stay.  From the moment we arrive a little sleepy from our overnight flight to the last breakfast before heading to the airport the service levels are unparallel to any hotel in the world.  As I may have said in previous review, any hotel with a button on the phone that says ""Whatever, Whenever"" is a place you must stay.  We will be back again (and again).    The entire staff always has a smile on their face and treat you like family."
October 2023,Recurring theme,"Back to 41 again, and how lovely it was to return.  When you haven’t stayed for a few months, you tend to forget the amount of pleasure you feel when the greeting comes from each and every member of the team who approach with a welcoming smile.  And so it begins: the experience of being a treasured guest at every moment of contact, your every wish carried out and in many cases, anticipated and a choice offered.  This is five- star hospitality as it should be, as the prestigious Forbes rating denotes.   There are many accounts of the quality of the Team, the Executive Lounge, the impeccable housekeeping, the wonderful quirkiness of the building and the Plunder the Pantry offering (which was recommended to me by an American guest who was unaware that I was a regular, and was…"
October 2023,The best of the best,"Hotel 41 can not be beaten. It is so comfortable and relaxing with attention to every detail. We have stayed many times and will continue to do so. We feel so at home in the lounge, where we enjoy the friendly atmosphere, and a laugh with the staff. Satish, Esin Rory and Gabrielle are just priceless."
October 2023,The most fabulous hotel in the heart of London.,"An exceptional boutique hotel next door to Buckingham Palace and 2 minutes from Victoria.  Only 28 rooms, each beautifully appointed and very, very quiet, despite being in the centre of London.  The staff provide 5 star plus service from booking to departure. They are friendly, gracious and extremely helpful.  A perfect oasis for a short or long stay.  Delicious breakfasts. Snacks on display and a magnificent range of wines, cocktails and spirits."
October 2023,Practically Perfect In Every Way,"The ideal London hotel. The staff lead the charge in creating the charm, elegance, and character of this wonderful respite. They work in tandem to create incredible bespoke experiences for their guests, taking care to understand our personal and practical needs, while enriching our experiences with their own personal flare. It was such a pleasure to spend time with each and every one we met there, and sincerely appreciate their attentiveness, thoughtfulness, and creativity.   The beds and amenities are modern and comfortable, and the rooms, halls, and lounge exude cozy luxury. The lounge spoils guests with day-round availability of snacks, and there are fresh scones, jam and clotted cream after 2pm...skip the mid-day nap and rest up for your evening out by having scones and a…"
October 2023,Very unique and memorable hotel.,"I've been to many 5-star luxury hotels, but Hotel 41 left a very special impression. The entrance to the hotel was not large, but the hotel staff, who seemed to have been waiting for us from the moment we opened the door and walked in, welcomed us, guided us to a special lounge, served us welcome tea, and we received check-in service while eating a small cake. I was very impressed that the hotel already knew who we were and provided service before I even said my name. The hotel room was very comfortable, luxurious, and clean, and they provided cleaning service in the morning and evening, as well as a small gift. Also, every time we came back from sightseeing in London, they welcomed us at the door, so we felt like we were coming home every time. All of the bedding at Hotel 41…"
September 2023,Exceptional Service,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for three nights while in London. The hotel is wonderfully situated for exploring the city.  The room was lovely.  It was very quiet and the bed and pillows made falling asleep easy after a day of adventuring.  The shower had plenty of hot water and great water pressure.    The best thing about the hotel is the personal service.  The staff was eager to make sure we enjoyed our stay and our experience in London.  When we arrived after an overnight flight, the concierge saw to it that we got the best coffees to keep us awake and going throughout the day.  We were even able to check into our room early!  For the hotel happy hour, the server brought us canapés and salty snacks gratis.  The concierge was always eager to offer help and suggestions…"
September 2023,Stay here for a wonderful experience ,"I've stayed at many hotels, 5 stars among them over the years, but this place in terms of furnishings, and exceptional service absolutely stands out. In a word, it is a fabulous place and in a great central location as well. You can usually find something to critique wherever you go but we couldn't here.  From the time we arrived to when we left the service was 5 star plus. Consider this for your next trip to London as we will on our next trip...I can't imagine staying anywhere else after being here"
September 2023,Hotel 41 stay was excellent!,"My spouse and I stayed here for one night in mid September 2023. We loved it. We arrived into Heathrow from east coast U.S. at 6:30 a.m. and took the Tube To Victoria Station. From there it was about a 5 minute walk to the Hotel. We had emailed a couple months in  advance to ask about an early check-in. We got a quick reply with an offer to leave our bags and relax in the Executive Lounge. Arriving around 1000, we received exactly what we were told. The Executive Lounge was excellent! We enjoyed coffees, ordered greek yoghurts with raspberry compote (delicious) and very soon after our room was ready. The staff at check in and in the Executive Lounge were great. Our room (Junior Suite) right outside the Executive Lounge was top notch. A very large bathroom with both a large…"
September 2023,Simply the best of the best.,By far the best hotel I have EVER stayed in. The service was second to none. I stay in London often and often treat myself to a superior room or a suite. Their Executive King room trumped anywhere I have ever stayed including exclusive chains like the Baglioni and St Pancras Renaissance.  The staff were simply amazing. They made sure to know both my husband and I by name our entire stay.  The little touches in the room just went above and beyond. It was truly an experience.  Special shout out to Shân who was absolutely lovely.
July 2023,The Best Hotel In The World. Period.,"This is the best hotel in the world!  We've stayed at the Burj Al Arab in Dubai, Pendry New York and The Savoy. None of these have come close to what we received at Hotel 41, pure luxury.  As soon as you walk through the front doors, the pleasure begins. Your bags disappear and you're escorted upto the Executive Lounge where you are treated with a glass of Champagne. Instantly every staff member knows your name and you're given time to relax and unwind from the outside world. Once settled, the staff, in our case Andrea, guides you to your room. We were very lucky to be given the Monarch Suite.   OMG, the Monarch Suite, what a suite! From the Queen size bed, two bathrooms and lounge and every extra you need for a stay. It oozes lush.  Once you get over the room, you'll head back…"
July 2023,Best hotel we have been to!,"By far the nicest hotel we have ever been to. The staff is super friendly and will help you with anything you need. Yes, it is expensive, but it is worth every cent. The hotel is super quiet and you can sleep all day if you would want to. The location is perfect, near Buckingham Palace, walking distance to Harrods and Bond Street so great for shopping. The interior is not boutique hotel modern, but very old school English. Can't wait to be back! "
July 2023,The best of its kind!,"We’ve just returned from a seven night stay at Hotel 41. We had a split level suite with a king bed that suited our needs perfectly. The attention to detail was evident everywhere, not only in the facilities and amenities, but also in the little touches such as daily replenished fresh fruit and the daily “treats” left on the bed at turndown.   The bathroom featured INSTANTLY available hot water, more than ample water pressure (you never realize how important this is unless you don’t have it), heated towels and ample space for toiletries for two. The bathtub was of a size to encourage basking and the shower was both versatile and intuitive in operation — a delicate balance seldom achieved.   Shortly after your arrival, most, if not all, of the staff will know you by name. At any…"
July 2023,"Always stay here when I am in London. Great service, impeccable hotel.","We have stayed at Hotel 41 for the third time. And there is a reason why we always come back. Feels like a quaint Hotel in a large city in the perfect spot.   We spent our anniversaries here for the third time. Always feels special. The rooms are wonderful, staff is amazing and location you can’t beat.   Even the scent of the amazing hotel is something I love. We always think of Hotel 41 as the place to go for a special occasion. Even our happy anniversary pillows and a yummy cake to celebrate. The little things matter in an age where service is hard to come by.   Highly recommend. And always will come back. Thank you for making it wonderful."
June 2023,The best hotel ever,"The best hotel i have ever stayed! Simoly the best! Complimentary pantries during all day long (ice creams, lindts chocolates, candies - canapes from 5pm to 7pm and many dishes/goodies from 8pm to 1am), many perks at our room - very cosy place, amazing bed and pillows. Two options to our bath separately ; bathtub and a shower. The breakfast is also incredible, many options. One of the highest point, the icing on the cake: Eder and Pedro , completely wonderful hosts - polite, helpful, always smiling. Their hospitality turned our experience into a marvellous experience. "
August 2022,What a FANTASTIC experience ,"We visited for my birthday and from start to finish were treated to such an amazing stay, with everything thought of it was a wonderful place to be, we also loved going for drinks in the downstairs bar which also serves sushi. Picturesque hotel!"
July 2023,Hidden Gem Near Buckingham Palace,"This is a wonderful boutique hotel found on the fifth floor of the same building as the Rubens. They give very personalized attention—from showing us the room details to helping us with getting a take away breakfast for our early morning flight. We had a gorgeous room and thoroughly enjoyed ""plundering the pantry"" each night!"
June 2023,Wonderful stay in London,"This boutique hotel is truly excellent!  It is small and the service is very personal.  It is better than some Ritz Carltons I have stayed in.  The staff could not have been more pleasant.  It is quiet and not one of those places to be seen in.  Given how hectic London is, it was truly an Oasis.  It is a bit expensive but we do not travel to London often."
April 2023,Great british hotel,"came to this hotel for my britain trip and it was a pretty nice hotel. the service was nice and the rooms were clean. this is a good hotel i would probably come again. Thanks for reading this review, and i hope it helps with future decisions. Have a great day!"
June 2023,The Best,"I have stayed at some of the best hotels around the world and I must admit that it takes a lot to impress me.  Hotel 41 not only impressed but surpassed all expectations.    The hotel has only 28 rooms all on one floor close to Buckingham Palace.  The hotel has the feel of an exclusive private club without an air of pretentiousness.  Our room was very very nice with bed sheets and pillows that were a joy to experience each night  But it was the service that truly set this hotel apart from others.   Individuals like Eder, in guest services, went out of his way to ensure that we had all that we needed.  He took the time to personally help us pick up an item that we needed as opposed to just providing directions to the pharmacy.  This was a hint of the type of service that we…"
September 2023,Unique experience - feels like staying at a friend in his old Englisch home. Highly recommended.,"Excellent! Very unique experience. Not your typical hotel with a gracious foyer or reception. Feels more like staying at your friends old English home. Very cozy. Unbelievable friendly, vigilant and helpful staff. Great location. Lots of attractions and restaurants/pubs in walking distance. Hanging out in their executive lounge provides tranquillity and brings you back in time. The same applies to the rooms. Breakfast and drinks are outstanding. They even have a little rooftop terrace with seating and a bar. The only thing, though: I am 6 feet tall and not all of the sitting areas in the beautiful executive lounge are spacious enough to sit comfortably. One bathroom in our room felt more like I have to put it on rather than being able to walk in. Given the otherwise outstanding…"
September 2023,Perfection,Just returned from a 3rd visit to Hotel 41 as was celebrating a big birthday. From the minute you step foot into the downstairs foyer you are treated like royalty. All the staff are so helpful & nothing is too much trouble. I do have to give Connor a special mention here as he was who we all dealt with the most. They  arranged canapés & champagne on the roof top bar before we went out. You actually don’t even need to go anywhere as there is always something out for you to eat! We all can’t wait to return & are already planning our next visit.
July 2023,Wonderful experience.,"We loved this hotel.  The staff treated us like royalty the moment we walked through the door. Hotel 41 is a boutique hotel with only 28 rooms.  The staff’s attention to detail is remarkable.  The rooms were nicely appointed and the black and white decor is very attractive .  Upon arrival, we were taken to the Executive Lounge where everything happens.  Breakfast, tea time and dinner is served in the lounge.  Our breakfast was included with our reservation.  All other food was complimentary.  The only complaint we have is that it was not made clear that the beverages are not included (ie juice, coffee, tea, soda).  It was our understanding that only alcoholic beverages were not included.  There were four of us present when the amenities were explained.  I don’t believe all four…"
August 2023,Brilliant!,Outstanding service. Excellent location opposite Buckingham Palace. Have stayed twice and will return. It’s the little touches like staff knowing your name that make this hotel stand out. Breakfast was fabulous too.
August 2023,Service with a capital S!,"The service at this hotel is AMAZING!  It is in a great location, and the rooms are really nice, but what separates it is the service!  From the welcome champagne to the day long snacks, they really could not be any more accommodating.  Our stay in London was too short this time but would definitely return to the 41 on a future trip….five stars all the way!"
August 2023,Outstanding Service In an Elegant Boutique Hotel,"The most superb experience we've ever had at a 5-star property.  Outstanding personalized service, beautiful accommodations, and amazingly attentive staff.  We were greeted by name by each staff person, provided super helpful suggestions for day trips and dinner cruise, and made to feel incredibly special.  One of the best boutique properties we've ever experienced - and we've been to a lot! "
August 2023,Excellent Experience,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for two nights and found the experience to be perfect. From the seemless check in, to the fantastic staff. Our room was extremely well appointed and lacked for no amenities. The Executive Lounge was wonderful, and our breakfasts were top notch."
August 2023,Absolutely stunning hotel,"Hotel 41 is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed!  The rooms are absolutely gorgeous.  The staff is UNBELIEVABLY helpful, courteous, welcoming and accommodating.  We will definitely return and will recommend this hotel every time someone asks us about our trip to London.  This one should not be missed!  "
August 2023,50th birthday celebration,"Stayed for my wife’s 50th birthday, from the moment we arrived to the minute we left everything we experienced was just totally flawless, from  the staff to the whole experience of the hotel was just outstanding, the staff go above and beyond making your stay special, by far the best hotel we have stayed in and we will definitely be returning, well done hotel 41 you deserve all the accolades that come your way 👏👏👏"
July 2023,Hotel 41 Is What Every London Hotel Should be Modeled On,"This is hands down my wife's and I favorite hotel (and now even our 3 children)! We've been there 3 times now and It's pure English Class with the best service that we have ever received anywhere in the world. The rooms are impeccable and the thoughtfulness  and attention to detail of the staff is exquisite.   Also, their executive lounge (the heart of the hotel) is one of the most coziest and relaxing places we have ever had a meal or drinks. It made me feel like at anytime I could turn my head and see Sherlock Holmes in a corner sofa drinking some brandy attempting to solve his next case.   All that to say, if you want an unforgettable time in London, Hotel 41 is a must! "
March 2023,Amazing honeymoon experience 😍 ,"My husband and I recently stayed at hotel 41 London, in the Conservatory suite for our honeymoon. From the moment we walked in we felt well taken care of, and we enjoyed everything from the greeting glass of sparkling wine to the optional extras like flowers and chocolates in the room. The meals, the service, and the beauty of this historic boutique hotel were all excellent. Be aware though, it is in the heart of the city and if you're a light Sleeper you may want to consider something to cut the noise of sirens. "
April 2023,Unique interior and very friendly staff,"Very friendly staff who helped us, excellent customer service, great location, nice food, the roof terrase is an extra cool feature of this hotel.  Interior design and furniture are unique and has its nice character. "
April 2023,Absolutely first class,"After numerous visits to Hotel 41, it never fails to please. The accommodation is outstanding, and the breakfasts are amazing. The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff are a credit to the Hotel. Nothing is too much trouble. "
March 2023,"The best hotel in London, hands down!","This is the second time we've stayed at Hotel41 and it won't be our last. What makes this hotel extremely special is the care that each and every staff members provide. It is amazing that the staff knows and remembers your name. Once you arrive, they never ask your name, they just know it. I tried to find out how they do it, but no one would divulge this secret. :-)   We loved hanging out in the lounge before and after dinner! The endless amount of snacks provided are also such a special touch. The housekeeping staff is the best staff that I've ever encountered, and we've stayed at many luxurious hotels. We can't wait to come back and visit again!"
February 2023,Hotel 41 - Only Option!,"I don’t usually write reviews, but in this case, I must. The staff at Hotel 41 graciously welcomes you into their family and makes you feel like home.  After spending seven nights at Hotel 41, I can truly say that other hotels simply do not and cannot compare. This is a 5-star hotel that is head and shoulders above other 5-star hotels. A few specific shout outs are absolutely necessary.  Sebestian (from Ruben’s) - His cheery disposition and positivity is second to none!   Alexandros - His thoughtful dining suggestions quickly became our list of musts. Alexandros’ quiet and considerate nature was so welcomed after long, busy days.  Belle - She always knew what we wanted before we even had to ask. Being proactive, attentive, and personable are just a couple of Belle’s strengths. …"
March 2023,Fantastic stay,"Fantastic stay at hotel 41. We stayed for two nights and had a wonderful stay, the bed was so comfortable,soft luxurious linen. The room was clean and had everything you needed. The staff couldn’t do enough for you, very attentive and professional. There is absolutely nothing to criticise, from the moment we walked in to the time we checked out."
March 2023,Exceeded Expectations ,"A place you dream of going back to. Prime location close to sights and public transportation, quiet, staff that treats you with a personal touch, a plethora of amenities from a free high-end buffet to little treats left at turndown and plush rooms that mix modern touches with old English style.  What a value for a hotel that makes you feel special each moment you come in or leave! Every staff member was friendly and interested (huge shout-out to Alex who served me several times in the lounge) and they made an effort to listen. For example, on my first night I returned home from a show to find a note from housekeeping saying they hoped I enjoyed it.  The accommodations are quiet and peaceful. I spent hours in the lounge in the evening reading and enjoying the complimentary buffet…"
April 2022,At Home in Hotel 41,"Before my family travels abroad, we usually research the highest rated (by ranking) hotels in our destination cities.  In 2016, Hotel 41 (A Red Carnation Property) was one of the highest ranked hotels in London & featured stellar reviews for its location &  service.  We decided to stay there and were thrilled we did.  We will never forget the tea and treats, the uniquely designed rooms and convenient location.  All the photos of their rooms and common areas on the  website look pristine and that's exactly how we found them.    After busy days of exploring London, visiting Stonehenge, and taking in the musical Aladdin, we return to Hotel 41 ready to relax as if it were our home.  We would usually sit in what looked like a large library or observatory and just exhale & recount the…"
March 2023,Amazing hotel and such attentive staff.,"Where to begin?! We went to London to go to the theatre for my wife's birthday and stayed two nights. All members of staff at Hotel 41 were fantastic and nothing was too much trouble for anyone. We were upgraded to an Executive Suite which was lovely. The room was super comfortable and the little touches were so nice from a little message on the mirror in the bathroom to finding our glasses cleaned and a hotel styled glasses cloth each left for us. Petals by the bed and a hot water bottle waiting for us were more wonderful touches. The food throughout the day was delicious- big fan of the plunder the pantry- and all staff from the doorman to the porters were all fantastically friendly, helpful and attentive. We felt like they were all so eager for us to have the best possible…"
March 2023,Simply First Class,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 again on a trip into London. It's an absolute gem. From the moment you walk through the door you are treat like royalty, every member of staff will go out of their way to make your stay as pleasant and as enjoyable as possible. The room was fantastic with every little detail considered and thought through so you want for nothing, with special little touches thrown in like welcome Macarons, turn down service etc. Drinks and plundering the pantry add to the whole relaxing and enjoyable experience. Having tried many similar hotels in London, this is our hotel of choice, it is simply first class!"
August 2023,Suberb and welcoming !,5 star service ! From the arrival to the departure. Very impressive. Connor was so kind and congenial. This type of service has a high value to us and we are very happy we chose Hotel 41 for our London 4 day trip. This is a great location close to the Victoria Train station /Gatwick Express.
August 2023,Sons 18th birthday,Great hotel . Staff went above and beyond for my sons 18th birthday . They put us in a private dining room for breakfast . They offered us a welcome drink . The snack bar was amazing with ice cream included 
August 2023,10/10 an absolute dream stay ,This hotel is a gem in London! Great air conditioning (for us from the USA) and the staff was incredible. The food was 5 star and house keeping impeccable. Would recommend to anyone and will return again! 
August 2023,The No 41 experience ,"Second time at this hotel and definitely won't be the last! A luxurious stay from start to finish . Beautiful rooms,wonderful staff and such a calm , tranquil atmosphere. Fully deserving of its reputation as the best in the UK."
July 2023,Not our cup of tea by a long shot!,"I have relied on TripAdvisor to book hotels and restaurants for almost 20 years. We even sometimes select cities to visit simply based on the hotel. As such and because I so rely on reviews that I relate to, I want to provide a clear picture of what you get at Hotel 41. We have previously stayed at The Edgerton House (another Red Carnation hotel in London) and the Ritz Carlton in London - and we absolutely loved both. In fact, we so enjoyed our time at The Edgerton House and after speaking with the manager there, we wanted to book another hotel in their collection.  We extremely disliked the ""atmosphere"" as well as the teeny tiny rooms, extremely narrow hallways, and limited common space at Hotel 41. And no one, except for the gentleman at the lobby desk one evening, ever asked…"
August 2023,Excellent,Excellent staff and service food and location brilliant rooms really lovely and decorated to a high standard wonderful stay all round hopefully will be back soon thank you to all for making us feel very welcome 
August 2023,Hotel 41. Highly recommend for a London stay,"Hotel 41 is an amazing hotel. Great location, very friendly and helpful / accommodating staff, comfortable rooms I would never think twice at always staying at hotel 41 when in London. Hotel 41 makes you feel at home. Highly recommend. BTW: Great snack bar in the Fabilous lobby "
August 2023,Perfect,"We’ve just returned from a two night stay at 41 - where stayed over 20 times.  It’s hard to des rube just how good the event is. I call it an event because every member of staff is consistently brilliant, helpful and friendly. Many staff have been there years and it’s like coming home - but nicer.  41 is a boutique hotel - rather like an exclusive club - quite old fashioned but in a brilliant way. The staff are simply exceptional. Nothing is too much trouble. The executive lounge is perfect in its tranquility and style. Adele and Marlen are stalwarts who make everything perfect.   There is a ‘grab’ bar of sweets during the day, scones in the afternoon, various dishes / cakes during the evening all complimentary. It’s annexed to the Rubén’s hotel so the extent of beverages and…"
July 2023,Worth it,I think I have reviewed 41 on other stays but I am not sure I said the following: It is worth the premium you pay simply for the service and the wonderful people that provide it. We actually miss the friends we have made on the staff. And I am not sure there is a better location of a hotel in London to reach everything. Victoria Station two blocks in one direction and Buckingham two blocks in the other.
June 2023,Just like Home.. without the work,"This is a home away from home experience.  If you want a big hotel vibe with loads of action go next door to their sister hotel.  We LOVED our experience here.  The staff were like family by the time we left.  From check in to the incredible bar/waitstaff you literally are spoiled.  Rooms are well appointed with big waters, beautiful soap and lovely little presents on your bed in the evening.  The location is the best close to the changing of the guard, and Buckingham.  The hotel has a cute small rooftop bar that you can have a cocktail and just get away from the chaos of the city.  If I return I will stay here as it felt like home."
December 2022,20th Anniversary Trip to London,"We could not have dreamed up a better hotel  for our anniversary trip to London! The size of Hotel 41 is what makes it special. Connected to The Ruben, Hotel 41 has its own entrance and private elevator that goes straight to the fifth floor, which is where all 28 rooms are located. We only ever interacted with Hotel 41 employees, aside from when the doormen at The Ruben hailed our cab. When we left early one morning for our Eurostar adventure to Paris, Tio from the Ruben came out and gave us maps and advice for our day!  You immediately feel pampered upon arrival as you are escorted to the fifth floor by the lobby attendant. Once upstairs, you check-in in the Executive Lounge. During the check-in process, you are treated to a glass of champagne and snacks. To our surprise, our…"
December 2022,41 GEM OF LONDON,"I stayed two nights at the 41 hotel in London 23 - 24 December 20022.  Was meeting my sister, her husband and my uncle in central London so wanted to check out a hotel not in central London.  41 was the best boutique hotel I have ever stayed in.  Next to the Rubens Hotel and owned by the same company 41 was a great experience.  From check in to check out I was pampered, taken care of and helped with any travel questions I had.  Location is not great but it is 3 minute walk to the tube.  Rooms are fantastic, with a fire place on the first level,  the room I had was a two level room.  The check in area is also the hotel lounge which serves drinks and food and snacks at time.  The lounge also had a big library, so if you like to read it had lots of interesting books.  Over all a…"
October 2022,Best hotel stay ever!,"Hotel 41 was the most amazing hotel experience I have ever had! This was my first trip to London and I will never forget it because of this fantastic hotel!  I found this gem not realizing how wonderful it was until we visited. The people were helpful, genuine, and made me feel important yet cozy at home. The hotel and staff took wonderful care of us! My husband and I can't wait to return to stay with them again. "
December 2022,Hotel 41 over Christmas,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for nine days over Christmas. We chose the hotel based on a stay there in 2013 which had been very enjoyable. The location of the hotel is excellent, the rooms are comfortable and the single, central lounge is warm and welcoming. But what makes this hotel different is the staff. The staff to guest ratio is higher than in most other hotels and the service is simply outstanding. Every one of them goes out of their way to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. I cannot thank them enough for making our Christmas a home away from home."
December 2022,A hidden gem,"Well what can I say from the moment we arrived and pulled up outside. The staff were quick to park the car and the feeling of total relaxation descended. The care, the greetings and smiles , the warmth , of the ambiance of this beautiful hotel took hold. We were upgraded and the room was to die for. The drinks , food and the personal touches made this stay very magical at Christmas, so we can’t thank and praise enough the staff at the hotel 41 for the pleasure. We also popped next door to Rubén’s hotel for the cocktail experience which was a lovely evening so a big thank you to the staff there also, in summary if you want luxury at a personal level please try this jewel hidden in London well worth the visit ."
December 2022,Post Xmas joy!! ,"To take a phrase from Craig Revel Horwood our stay was 'Fab-u-lous Darling'!!!. From the moment we both arrived and checked in, to the morning we sadly departed a wonderful experience was made.  Many thanks to all the wonderful staff who made our stay special. "
December 2022,Exceptional staff,"This hotel is special because of its staff.  The rooms are nice , the position is good  but so are in many other 5* hotels in London, but you never get a service quite like in Hotel 41.  I was a bit skeptical when I read reviews in the past but they are in the class of their own.  It is not just that the service is great, it is that all the staff seem to be happy to be and work there!  It makes a big difference. There seem to be two types of rooms - the reasonably priced rooms and the not so reasonably priced suites of various types.  We stayed in the reasonably priced room which had everything you could want though some of it was a little on the bijou side, e.g. shower cubicle.  But hey, there was one as well as bath so it is great.   The bed is comfortable, there is a space to…"
November 2022,Beyond excellence,"I recently made a return visit to Hotel 41 as the previous experience with my husband was superb and we intended to return. I now travel alone having lost my husband but was determined to return to Hotel 41 as we had planned. I experienced excellence at all levels of Hotel 41 from the rooms, facilities and of course the wonderful staff who  were attentive, warm and caring making this stay extra special. I am so looking forward to my next visit in 2023. Thank you to everyone at Hotel 41."
November 2022,the only place to stay in London,"Our delight was the staffs main concern every moment & every night we stayed @ Hotel 41. This exquisite boutique hotel surpassed every one of our expectations. We are an international traveling couple. And to receive from the Staff of Hotel 41 such individual greetings, assistance & personal attention is an art of service seldom experienced. This art of service is solidly engrained in every fiber of the true character of Hotel 41's being. The staff's commitment to detail is effortless on their part, its simply their nature. We experienced an unsurpassed caliber of service, relaxation & comfort in the Executive lounge for afternoon tea, evening snacks & beverages, to the plush comfort & the delicious macaroons in our suite. So may tiny details of perfection! In passing, we…"
December 2022,Another fabulous stay at the faultless Hotel 41,Outstanding- fabulous as always! Another wonderful stay at Hotel 41. I would not stay anywhere else. The team are faultless in the care they take of guests and the level of comfort and the efforts made to ensure guests have everything they need is exceptional.   There have been lots of new staff join in the last few months but many of the old team remain. The new team are of a very high standard - really pleased to see such high standards being maintained  Thank you
October 2022,Wonderful hotel experience on our first trip to beautiful London,The hotel was exceptional!  Service is outstanding and decor throughout is beautiful!  Staff was always available for anything you needed and always extremely pleasant. I would highly recommend this hotel  You will not be disappointed!
September 2022,The Crown Jewel,"I can't express how much I loved ""the experience"" at this little gem. We arrived in London on Sept 28th for 6 nights for the Vikings/Saints game. My husband wanted to stay in Chelsea for the last 3 nights to be near friends who live there, but he allowed me to pick a hotel for the first 3 nights to celebrate my 50th birthday (and a belated anniversary gift).   Hotel 41 is the exquisite little sister hotel to the adjacent full service Rubens hotel situated in the heart of London, a quick walk from the gates of Buckingham Palace. When you walk in, you are warmly greeted each and every time, like you are a missed family member that they are happy to see You feel like you are in a 5 star hotel, without the arrogance of many 5 star hotels.   Your luggage is whisked away to your room,…"
September 2022,Love this hotel!,What a delight to find this fabulous hotel.  It is the epitome of English hospitality and service.  Small hotel only 28 rooms.  The service was 5 Star.  We will be back again the next time we are in London.  Just what we needed before departing back home to California. Marta and Stephen
October 2022,Best little hotel at the heart of London,"Very comfortable hotel at the center of London. Rooms are vey accommodating, beautifully decorated and very clean. Stuff is great, tending to all your needs. The lounge is great with snacks and beverages served all day and night. We stayed at the hotel for four nights and enjoyed it very much."
October 2022,This hotel will spoil you for every other hotel. Great experience!,"There is absolutely NOTHING not to like in this hotel. From the moment you arrive, till the moment you leave, you are spoiled and pampered. Everyone is going out of their way to make you feel at home. The beds are the best I've EVER slept in. The temperature in the room is easily adjustable, There is no noise disturbance, even if you may expect this in an old building and the service is above and beyond. The warmed floor in the bathroom, heating for your towels, a bath, the room was spacious, with loads of storage, safe and special cabinets for your smaller items. USB spots to charge your items, near the desk and next to your bed. Very convenient. I loved every part of my stay. The room is a great size for what I'm used to in London, but the lounge is just stunning. With…"
September 2022,"Very special small luxury hotel, but service is not what it used to be","This is a very peculiar hotel in the middel of London, set in the 5th floor of the Ruebens Hotel it has its own entrance and elevator, this is my third stay at the property.  Service is still very good and personal, but it takes forever to check in and out.  Rooms are on the small side, and the decoration is starting to look a bit dated (the black sofa on our room 4112 is worn.  Beds are delicious, but upon asking for dow pillows what we got was not satisfactory.  All in all still a very private and good experience, but not as good as the previous two."
October 2022,A fabulous experience,"We were treated by our daughter and grandson to stay at Hotel 41 as part of our Golden Wedding celebrations. We did not look at any reviews beforehand as we trusted our daughters selection.  From the minute we walked into the beautifully scented foyer until the time we left we were treated by staff as visiting VIPs - with no exception.  On our first night we arrived very late due to flight delays and as we sat down to a welcoming glass of champagne another resident asked if we had stayed here before. We explained this was our first visit and she said that you will never want to stay in any other hotel in London again. How right she was.  The food throughout our stay was excellent and we certainly enjoyed the complimentary snacks.  If you are looking for something special, this…"
September 2022,Excellent!,"What can you say about a hotel that is this amazing. Personal and excellent service 24 hours a day. Professional and discreet service from the moment you get up until you go to bed.  Food, drinks available 24 hours a day. Small gifts and hand written notes each night.  Beautifully appointed rooms and bathrooms. All this and a great location. I will definitely return."
September 2022,Prepare to be pampered,My husband and I ended a 3 week vacation  with our stay at Hotel 41.  It was definitely a 5 star experience.  We felt so pampered.  The staff anticipated our every need and we really enjoyed the ambiance of the executive lounge. We definitely enjoyed their team of professionals in meeting our requests and helping us feel relaxed in a new city. The hotel is very close to Buckingham Palace and is a great starting point for many other 'must see' attractions.  Thanks to everyone who helped make the end of our vacation just perfect.
September 2022,Three days of bliss,"It was lovely to return to 41 again and to relax on the sofa with a greeting glass of their excellent house champagne.  Owing to the pandemic, our recent visits have been reduced in number but we hope to bring them back to a regular pattern as time progresses.   Lots of new faces - again owing to the huge changes in the whole of the hospitality industry - and all the new staff are of the same high standard of friendly, efficient service as in previous times.    Only the best for 41.  Alex has only very recently arrived - a matter of a few weeks - and yet he conveyed a knowledge and attentive, caring attitude that made us feel as though he had been there for much longer.  Giving us his full attention, he still kept a discreet eye flickering over the room as a good professional…"
September 2022,Un-British in quality and service,"London has many fantastic hotels and unfortunately I found out today that this is not one of them. If you are looking for high quality and hygienic British establishment at this price with staff who value etiquette and manners please consider the Rosewood; the Connaught, the Park Lane Hotel, the Hamyard Hotel, the Chiltern firehouse, so on. Even the Savoy packed on a hen-do filled weekend is better.   The doormen are lovely, I have walked by this spot for many years and had lovely exchanges them. I thought I might go in for a spot of lunch with a friend who was staying at the hotel after a long morning of volunteering. I wanted to change into a better outfit before sitting down.  I entered and the entryway was full of tourists; it smelt damp and felt stale but I suppose it…"
September 2022,Anniversary,A truly memorable stay made special by the amazing staff and service.  The experience was personalised and thoughtful we would be delighted to visit again soon and will recommend to family and friends wishing make a wonderful memory.
September 2022,Hotel One-derful!,"Stayed at Hotel 41 from September 11-15, 2022.  From the moment we entered, the staff just lavished us with TLC!  We felt that we could ask them for anything to lessen the fatigue and stress that is felt the morning after any travel involving crossing time zones.  The Queen’s passing made the neighborhood around the hotel quite crowded and  chaotic.  Once you entered the lobby, it was quiet and felt like an oasis of calm.  We loved the comfortable bed, delicious snacks and breakfast and most of all, the cheerful, professional, courteous and kind staff.  We will look at other Red Carnation Group hotels when we travel again.  Thank you, Hotel 41, for making our first visit to London very special."
September 2022,Wonderful Hotel and Staff!,"I really can't say enough about our experience at Hotel 41. The hotel itself is beautiful, with a gorgeous main lounge/lobby, and a beautiful rooftop terrace. The room was spacious and chic, and the amenities were plentiful. But the thing that really shines is the staff. Every person we encountered was lovely and so helpful. Their attentiveness was such that I felt like we were the only guests in the entire hotel. They even surprised us with an upgrade to a suite when I told them it was my birthday, and went above and beyond to delight us throughout our time there. I will absolutely be back, and cannot recommend this hotel and it's staff enough."
September 2022,Top Notch Service,"We had a lovely time at Hotel 41! The service was phenomenal and attention to detail was pristine. The staff was always overly accommodating to any request we had. The breakfast was always enjoyable. We appreciated the cleanliness of the hotel. Also, the location was great."
September 2022,An amazing stay in a wonderful hotel with fantastic staff,"This was our second stay at this unique hotel and was our number one choice to enjoy another special occasion, this time my wife's birthday. After first staying 6 years ago to mark the night I proposed I thought this couldn't surpass that occasion and the extra mile the staff went to ensure it really was a special event but they pulled it off.   To say we were given a room upgrade is an understatement of epic proportions. We were presented with the Conservatory suite in all its splendor, which was a wonderful surprise for us both. I can't thank them enough for making this happen. The room was mind blowing and thankfully we had a clear night sky and was able to fall asleep beneath the stars.  The staff are amazing, friendly, knowledgeable and made us feel at ease throughout our…"
September 2022,A pleasure!,"Charming, beautifully designed & appointed boutique hotel. Staff went above & beyond to help us during the very difficult weekend of the Queen’s death. Wonderful breakfast & gorgeous executive lounge. Black & white decor is stunning. Lovely experience!"
September 2022,Outstanding!,"A return visit and such a treat. Unparalleled hospitality and comfort from a superb, professional team. A special thank you to Steve Jones for the genuine warmth of his welcome - what a gentleman! Also to Esin who's smile and real friendliness was matched only by the late summer sunshine streaming in through the windows! Thank you too, Adele, for your kindness on checking out. The whole team are an absolute credit to the business - it's not often you can say that."
September 2022,Friendly and quiet town house hotel with discrete and immaculate service,"Quite and friendly atmosphere, excellent rooms and service. Clean and large room. Great lunch and breakfast and we were also offered excellent drinks late in the evening. We also received a nice welcoming letter in order for the hotel to adapt to our needs. This is from now on our favourite hotel in London."
August 2022,An absolutely incredible boutique hotel within walking distance to Buckingham Palace,"We had an absolutely amazing time during our stay at Hotel 41. So much so that we skipped the last stop on our trip to go back to Hotel 41 for 1 more night before heading back to the states. The hotel itself is beautiful and in a perfect location but the staff is what really set it apart. Everyone was incredibly welcoming, helpful and attentive. If I find myself in London again, I won’t even bother looking at another hotel!"
June 2022,Exceptional in every way,"I couldn’t be more pleased with my experience at Hotel 41. I was greeted with a complimentary champagne and relaxed in the stunning executive lounge. They serve a delicious breakfast there each morning but also have tasty treats available until 1am. There wasn’t a request or a question that wasn’t handled quickly and with a friendly approach. The staff truly became family to our group of 3 ladies traveling together. They were protective and warm and assisted with securing reservations when needed. I will definitely return to the small, luxurious gem near Buckingham Palace."
June 2022,Amazing hotel not to be missed,I recently stayed at the Hotel 41 for several days and was pleasantly surprised by what an enjoyable experience it was.  This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at.  The service at the hotel is amazing. Every staff member knew our names from the minute we arrived and they went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable.  The rooms were very comfortable.  We had an issue with a light in our room and a maintenance man came on a Sunday evening and cheerfully handled it.  There is a beautiful lounge available 24 hours a day with food and drinks. We ate a delicious breakfast there every morning. Great location near Buckingham Palace and the Victoria Palace Theatre where we saw Hamilton.  I will definitely stay there again and highly recommend it.
June 2022,The best way to end the trip!!,Asmaa and Steve definitely know how to make you feel welcome. The hotel is beautiful and is a great place to relax and feel at home after a wonderful trip!! Steve whips up an awesome Negroni as well as other cocktails. #attention to detail. Thank you Hotel 41!!
June 2022,The perfect getaway,"This was our second stay at the 41; we have stayed at a number of hotels in London but the 41 has become our favorite. It is a warm and intimate setting.  The staff is very friendly, competent and couldn’t be more accommodating (even when you’re cranky from lack of sleep)!!  The location is close to all the things you’ll want to see and very close to rail and bus transportation. We’re already looking forward to our next stay."
May 2022,A Gem of a Hotel in the Heart of Royal London,"Hotel 41 is a jewel of a hotel. The rooms are beautiful, comfortable and very clean. The Executive Lounge is open to all guests 24 hours a day with food, drinks, and a friendly, well-trained staff on hand to assist. The location can't be beat -- it is literally across the street from Buckingham Palace. I can't wait to visit, again!"
June 2022,Excellent,"As usual, the staff and experience were wonderful. We could treat the hotel as a home where we were pampered. Our time in the lounge in the evenings, meeting and talking to staff and guests was just delightful. In our life of travel, we don’t think we have ever met such an attentive and well-trained staff. This is especially impressive during this difficult time of hiring and retaining staff."
May 2022,Great stay at Hotel 41,"I felt compelled to write a review about my stay at Hotel 41. To be perfectly honest this is not my normal level of hotel as it is not cheap. It was a huge splurge for me and my granddaughter. The staff are tremendous as I was feeling a little intimidated, but they were all sweet and welcoming. I especially want to mention Adele who is so excellent in every aspect of her job from being open and friendly to problem management. Also, Esin is so warm and friendly. The rooms are lovely with comfortable beds and spacious bathroom. Nice touches like turn down service with chocolate or a nice pillow spray. One night we sent to see Mary Poppins and they left a glowing message on the bathroom mirror when we got back hoping we enjoyed the show. Notes wishing us a good day..just little…"
May 2022,It just doesn't get any better,"The staff at this hotel is the best I've ever seen. From the reception to the servers in the lounge where you have breakfast and several complimentary snacks. The maids were so caring! But especially the lounge staff, who tirelessly cancelled reservations, got me medical care, and asked constantly how i was (yes I got covid!) The rooms are smallish, but very comfortable. I would go back in a minute!"
May 2022,"One of the best hotels in London, if not the Best!","I have recently become familiar with the Red Carnation Brand and I must say, I love everything about it! they truly make you feel at home.  The staff is incredibly attentive, the rooms are beautiful and no request is too small.  Check-in Process:  Esma from front desk was just amazing, very bubbly and full of life and made the check-in process incredibly fun! Rooms: the Conservatory suite is to die for - the bed is very comfortable, the room is spacious, lots of storage space. truly a beautiful suite.  Lounge: the staff are very attentive and they will make sure that all your needs are taken care of. the food is exquisite, often in lounges, the food can be average however the food there was freshly made with lots of choices.   We booked the private cinema experience which is…"
May 2022,We love this hotel!,It's been a few years since we have visited (pre pandemic) and it was so good to be back and to see that this hotel was just as lovely and the service was just as exceptional in these crazy times   This is our go to place in London.
May 2022,Hotel 41,"We booked this as an overnight stay for the theatre. The rooms were great, food was excellent & the location was perfect, however the best part was the service which was impeccable. I would go to the West-end just to stay there"
May 2022,"Amazing hotel, royal treatment and very unique.","This is not a 5 star hotel. More like 7. The whole experience is amazing. The staff were exceptional and the whole feeling of the place is an intimate private VIP club. Room is great and very comfortable. Location is fantastic. Can walk everywhere and Victoria station is right there. The snacks are fantastic. Only complaints is that I was introduced to a very fine red wine. So now, I have to try to get it in the US. You get the royal treatment. We stayed 4 nights. They helped us book a day trip to Bath.. I so recommend."
May 2022,Perfect 10,"Was I dreaming?...  Had the most amazing few days at Hotel 41 celebrating my birthday! From the moment I stepped foot into hotel 41, everything was a perfect 10.   A warm welcome in the lobby, and then greeted again with affection in the executive lounge and handed a glass of champagne, whilst hubby sipped a glass of merlot.  The room was cosy and clean, with a fire place and small seating area. All the expected amenities in a luxury 5 star pad, and added personal touches included a welcome letter, macaroons and birthday cake.  We enjoyed canapes and drinks before heading off to the cinema, returning to plunder the pantry with a bowl of hot chicken pie and salad, and naughty but nice desserts at midnight.  The turned down room awaited us, as the fire warmed our toes and we…"
May 2022,I honestly don’t think you could do better than 41….,"I’m not sure you can do better than the 41. This was a bit of a splurge for our 20th and it was worth every penny and then some. Though this is not our typical level of hotel, not once did anyone make us feel like we didn’t belong. All staff bent over backwards to make our stay as comfortable and memorable as possible. Rose petals and candles on the nightstands, a handwritten happy anniversary message on the mirror, a little something on the pillow every night….they know how to make you feel special. I am so glad I made this reservation and wouldn’t hesitate for a second to make it my first choice if we were to return to London one day."
May 2022,Small hotel with big personality,"Brilliant small hotel. Quirky layout of just 30 rooms allows a real sense of intimacy. I was there just 36 hours and was amazed to find staff knew my name, where I was heading next and what I’d done for the day. A bag of snacks sitting in my room before departure with a hand written note wishing me safe travels on my flight back to Australia. Very impressive"
May 2022,We will not stay anywhere else!,"Fabulous visit at Hotel 41!!!!!  We stayed there for 5 nights.  The location cannot be beat - we love to stroll through St. James Park and love to visit central London.  The service cannot be matched.  Each and every employee was knowledgeable, friendly, and caring.  Their evening turn down service was the best we’ve had anywhere in the world.  The calm environment and wonderful food and beverages in the Executive Lounge provided a calm start and end to our day - and afternoon tea allowed us to refresh before dinner.  Waking up in the states today and sooooo missing our lovely space there!  Thank you to the amazing staff who made our visit so special!!!"
May 2022,Truly Incredible Service,"We have vacationed in London many times in the past 10 years always staying in different locations, and staying at Hotel 41 was the absolute best experience we have ever had. The hotel itself is clean, the bar is available 24 hours, and the location allows for easy access to the whole city. But most of all, the entire staff team is incredible and absolutely made our trip so special. We were greeted each day to kind and helpful staff that made us feel like the most important guests onsite. We will absolutely be staying at Hotel 41 again in the future."
May 2022,Hotel 41,An absolute Fantastic hotel in centre of London. Champagne on arrival was a lovely touch. Outstanding service and very comfortable . Wonderful rod terrace. With drinks and canapés provided. Can’t wait to go again
May 2022,The best in London,"If you want anonymous luxury then head elsewhere, but if you want personalised luxury that somehow feels understated yet super lux then this boutique hotel ticks every box.  I’ve been visiting for several years and you’re always made to feel part of the family. This was a first time visit for my parents and the Hotel 41 team did not disappoint. Even by Hotel 41 standards they were superb, always seeking to give the best possible experience.  It’s certainly not cheap, but it’s an experience and you quickly realise the value the team provide."
May 2022,The best hotel in London without question,"This is London's only real 5***** hotel. We have stayed at all of the others...the icons of Mayfair and  Park Lane but none compare with Hotel 41.  Hotel 41 has atmosphere, brilliantly trained and friendly staff, superb management, an Executive Lounge better than any private club. This is THE place to stay in London"
November 2021,Another Wonderful Stay at 41,"We were ""welcomed home"" when we walked into 41 last Sunday. As usual, we sat with a glass of champagne in the executive lounge during check-in. When we we shown to our room, everything was absolutely perfect. The staff here cannot do enough for guests and really spoil you. Reservations were made for a very nice tapas restaurant, a short walk from the hotel. By the way, the Christmas lights on Regent, New Bond and Carnaby Streets were absolutely fantastic and worth a special pre-Christmas visit. After a great night with a very comfortable sleep, we enjoyed a superb breakfast (eggs Benedict and lattes are highly recommended). Afternoon tea service was quick and expertly presented. We had dinner next door later next door at BBar, which was up to the high standard of 41. We…"
November 2021,One of the most exceptional hotel experiences ever.,"There was no detail too small.  My wife and I recently stayed at 41 for two days of our trip, and our only regret was not booking the hotel for the entirety. Andrew Muir handled our check-in, and is a consummate professional, He provided us with every bit of information we needed and handled all of our requests. I am someone who has been fortunate to stay at many top tier hotels around the globe, and 41 is at the top of the class. Thank you so much to Andrew and the entire team at 41. Sammy H"
December 2021,Unique & very special,"We absolutely loved our stay at Hotel 41, & found everything about it exceptional & very unique. We have walked past this Hotel & even stayed at Rubén’s next door without even knowing it was there, but now we have discovered this absolute gem of a place we will definitely be coming back…(have already booked for the Summer when the roof top bar will hopefully be open). Service is attentive, Food & Cocktails are delish & the whole Executive Lounge grazing experience is a great foodie treat. Rooms are beautifully decorated & the attention to detail surpassed all our expectations, from chocs in the room on arrival to a hot water bottle in the bed & tea lights glowing in the bathroom. Small but beautifully formed, Hotel 41 could teach some of the big name 5 star London Hotels a trick…"
December 2021,Wonderful experience,"We stayed at the hotel with our dog for a few days and thoroughly enjoyed it. The service from every member of the team was impeccable - incredibly welcoming, helpful and thoughtful. Not only were we pampered by the team but our dog was too. He had toys, bottled water and treats, and the team treated him like a member of the family. The executive lounge was particularly cosy, and the daily snacks were not only delicious, but were a perfect accompaniment to the wide range of drinks available to help us unwind after a busy day. The food available from the menu in the executive lounge was of good quality.   This was the first time we stayed at the hotel and we can’t believe we have  not stayed here before. It is really a hidden gem in terms of the amazing service, comfortable rooms…"
November 2021,A wonderful Thanksgiving,"Another magical stay at Hotel 41. The staff is just above and beyond. Andrew and Diana made our visit perfect, secured all our reservations and were just brilliant  with service each day. I highly recommend Hotel 41 for any and all visits to London. Such a great location and staff. Best hotel we have ever stayed at on holidays and family trips. Thank you for the details each day, a wonderful time and the memories!!!"
March 2021,Very Nice!,I really enjoyed my stay there. Very beautiful and welcoming Hotel The room was very big and beds were nicely arranged . My whole family enjoyed the stay. But the price is too much.it should be reduced. We will be back definitely!
November 2021,Heaven on Earth,The place to stay in London great location .The staff and service you receive are truly amazing from the minute you enter the front door you are treated as part of the hotel 41 family . The hotel has a guest lounge  with a working fire where you can relax and use the facility they call raid the pantry where treats are available all day and evening to enjoy
November 2021,Luxury Treat,"Decided to seek out a luxury but intimate hotel for a trip to London.  Hotel 41 is a perfect choice, the staff are smart,unfailingly helpful and always smiling.  The bedroom was immaculate and no detail overlooked.  The decor is one of an exclusive gentleman's club and the food and cocktails first class.  Andrew made us feel at home from the first moment and you can tell that the management of this hotel has got the boxes ticked.  Ideally situated for walking to the many attractions, we took taxis from the railway station but in future would use the underground as Victoria is literally round the corner.  Top Hotel,  you will not be disappointed!"
November 2021,"Hotel 41, simply the best.","This hotel is truly one of London’s best kept secrets. Having stayed several times now, I simply wouldn’t choose anywhere else. Writing a review only reveals it to more people but it is truly exceptional.  From the management team down, there is nothing here that I could fault. From Andrew at the helm to Steve in the lounge, everyone is friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and skilled. An extraordinary group of workers.  The location, the food, the decor , the rooms, the “vibe”and the service - all exceptional.  Guests are made to feel extremely special, nothing is too much trouble, and goodness we’ve tried.  We’ve stayed in many many places all over the world, but hotel 41 is still the best and our favourite."
November 2021,Special birthday surprise,"An absolutely beautiful hotel. From the moment I made an initial enquiry the hotel staff were polite, friendly and very helpful. They answered my emails quickly and made several restaurants bookings for us. On arrival we were greeted by lovely staff and a glass of champagne. They had even provided a birthday cake and bottle of champagne in our room which was a lovely surprise. The hotel room was fabulous, luxurious and very clean. All of the staff were friendly, courteous and approachable. Nothing was too much trouble and they were always on hand to answer any queries. The breakfast was delicious with plenty of choice. The plunder pantry was amazing. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and will definitely be making a return visit."
September 2021,The perfect date night,"Where do I start? This was our second visit to Hotel 41 and somehow it was even better than the first!  Due to the pandemic, our previous two bookings had to be rearranged. We got engaged at Hotel 41 on the 18th December 2015 and have always wanted to return and last month we finally got there. What makes it special, beyond the beautiful decor, attention to detail, delicious food, etc, is the exceptional service. Somehow, the staff make every guest feel they are their most valued customer and they will go above and beyond to ensure you have the best possible experience.  We were welcomed by Erica and shown to the lift. As soon as we entered the lounge, Lauren welcomed us, ensured we were comfortable and brought the champagne trolley over so we could enjoy our first bit of luxury…"
August 2021,Beautiful hotel,"The reviews don't lie. Everything about this hotel is absolutely wonderful. It's located near Buckingham Palace and is really a hotel within a hotel. The rooms are spacious for London standards and are all well-appointed. The housekeeping is fantastic - I'm pretty observant and nothing was every missed in cleaning. The lobby / lounge are is a great meeting point and the fact there is always ice cream, snacks, drinks available makes it really enjoyable. However, as others have noted, what really sets this place apart is the service. definitely coming back here"
September 2021,A Special Place,"We were made to feel very special, and were upgraded to a suite which was very unexpected and very tastefully decorated and comfortable.  Excellent service and nothing too much trouble.  Great location for walking to attractions or shopping ! A big thank you to all the staff for being so welcoming and look forward to returning in 2022."
October 2021,A hotel like no other,"From the moment we arrived for our stay at Hotel 41 we were made to feel completely special and at home. the hotel is absolutely beautiful and the staff could not do enough for us during our entire visit. we have never experienced a quality of service like it before, and I wouldn't hesitate to stay again, or recommend to everyone. It was simply wonderful from start to finish."
October 2021,Not just a hotel but an experience!!,"This isn’t just a hotel, this is an experience!! A genuine haven of peace and luxury in the heart of bustling London!   The team at Hotel 41 were impeccable in their service, professionalism and creativity in making our trip unforgettable. We stayed at the hotel for four nights in October for a wedding anniversary and the team couldn’t do enough to help us plan the visit. The hotel itself is a stunning place to relax and unwind after a busy day in the capital. The rooms are first class, the executive lounge feels like a home from home and the staff brilliantly friendly. The Red Carnation Hotel group have a unique ability to make you feel like one of the family with welcoming and warm engagement but doing so with a poise that doesn’t feel too over familiar.   It was a wonderful…"
October 2021,The best  hotel in Britain,"This is our 1st visit to hotel 41, but not the last. It was our 39th wedding anniversary and    l must say the staff could not do enough to make our stay the best it could be. They went way beyond our expectations to make our celebration so special. The hotel facilities are fabulous, the staff exceptional in everything they do. We would like to thank each and everyone of them for giving us the best 3 days of our lives. Quite simply the best hotel experience we have ever had."
October 2021,Wonderful hotel,"We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41. It was a late birthday celebration, but well worth the wait. The staff were so professional and friendly from the minute we arrived. On checking in we were given a complimentary glass of champagne  which they offer to all guests. A lovely surprise was the upgrade to the Balmoral Suite and chocolate cake and a box of chocolates to celebrate my birthday. The hotel itself is decorated to the highest standard. Plenty of choice for breakfast and so tasty. We couldn't fault our stay and will definitely be back for another visit."
September 2021,Second stay; Look forward to the next!,"We had our first experience at Hotel 41 last year and booked again for our latest trip to London. As lovely as the rooms and common areas are, it is truly the staff that make this hotel experience top-tier. The staff's attention to preferences and personal touches raise the bar on service. The rooms are comfortable, well-appointed, and make it feel like a home away from home. We'll be back again on our next trip, without question!"
October 2021,Fabulous,Absolutly perfect! This is a hidden gem at the back of Buckingham palace. The bedroom we stayed in was lovely and the executive lounge such a nice place to relax!  The best was the “whatever whenever” dial in on the phone… made any request possible!
September 2021,Amazing,"Me and my fiancée had stayed at the hotel before and we were coming back for our anniversary. We were not disappointed. All the staff are amazing. When we arrived we saw a few members of staff that were at the hotel last time and what I found nice is that they actually remembered us as well which I found brilliant (well I hope for good reasons). On night we wanted to go out to a restaurant but it has been closed down so when speaking to reception they recommended a few restaurants for us to chose. They had booked the table for us and also mentioned to the restaurant that it was our anniversary. They also organised things for my anniversary like roses, champagne, a lovely cake and a lovely hand written card. The staff are so friendly and helpful. Anything you need they will get…"
September 2021,"Phenomenal hotel - great service, location and comfort - treat you like family",This hotel was fabulous from their service prior to arrival until we checked out.  Staff are all attentive and friendly.  Rooms are clean and comfortable.  We felt like part of the Hotel 41 family and everyone just seemed to know who we were.  Location is phenomenal with so much in walking distance.  We will definitely be back!
September 2021,Next Level....,"We stayed at 41 for our 10th anniversary and absolutely loved every single thing about it. Despite the well deserved reviews it still exceeded every expectation. It's the benchmark of how to find the balance between attention and intrusion, feeling comfortable and relaxed whilst being basically spoiled rotten . Thankyou so much for making a special occasion feel like it mattered to you too. Can't wait for next stay "
September 2021,An Fabulous Stay at Hotel 41,"We stayed two nights at Hotel 41. The checking in process was extremely painless. In fact we were taken to the beautiful lounge area & offered complimentary champagne whilst our bags were taken to our room. The staff are all incredibly polite, friendly & attentive. I am gluten intolerant & was told within 5 minutes of being there that the chef was aware & that it wouldn't be a problem catering for me at all. I get quite used to being treated as an awkward customer, so this made me feel comfortable immediately. The room was large, clean & the bed very comfortable indeed. We had complimentary chocolates, teas, Nespressso, filter coffee & bottle water. We also had a turn-down service where I was left a lovely pillow spray. I worked on my laptop during the day & the wifi was quick,…"
August 2021,One word - WOW!,"My partner and I stayed at 41 for just 1 night in August 2021 following an immensely enjoyable stay at the hotel’s sister property. Despite only staying for the night, our expectations of this beautiful hotel were far exceeded and this hotel is one that I am eager to visit again soon.  The hotel has a truly exclusive feel to it and this is something felt from the moment you enter the monochrome lobby and are swiftly escorted up to the Executive Lounge for a glass of champagne. The hotel is decorated throughout to the highest degree of elegance: monochrome accents and dark wood panelled walls adorn this gorgeous property and give it a truly chic vibe. We spent many hours in the Executive Lounge simply admiring the beauty of it.  Our hotel room was kindly upgraded at check-in to a…"
August 2021,Simply the best,"We visited 41 for a second time during our honeymoon and yet again it didn’t disappoint.   As soon as you arrive through the doors the beautiful signature scent hits you and you’re greeted warmly by the staff who are all absolutely amazing, so attentive and friendly.   The check in experience is second to none. You can stay in the beautiful executive lounge as long as you want whilst enjoying a glass of champagne (there are multiple options) of your choice. Just the best way to start a holiday.  We were shown to our beautiful suite which was absolutely stunning - a bathroom and seperate shower room, massive lounge area and honestly the most comfortable bed ever. The sheets are to die for- we were both exhausted after our wedding weekend and we slept so well! We were very…"
August 2021,"Amazing service, simply amazing!","We had read so many fantastic reviews on this hotel and wondered whether our stay would live up to our high expectations.  Well all I can say is it exceeded all our expectations and went straight to number one of our favourite hotels in London.    The staff are simply fantastic, professional and can't do enough for you.  Within a short time spent at the hotel we felt as if we had been coming to the hotel for years. The staff make quickly know your name and make you feel at home by being attentive with familiarity that is the right balance without you feeling uncomfortable or it being disingenuous.    The welcome glass of bubbly as you check in, the well appointed rooms and the sumptuous executive lounge did not disappoint.  Our highlight was the fantastic breakfast served each…"
August 2021,Our Favourite Hotel,"Our 3rd visit to Hotel 41 and another amazing experience.  The level of service is exemplery, staff are attentive and nothing is too much trouble. We were celebrating my birthday and my partner arranged a couple of experinces on offer through the hotel which were all fantastic. I cannot find any fault with this hotel and if you are looking for first class service in a luxurious setting then this is the place to stay."
August 2021,"If you can, book it!",You genuinely couldn’t ask for more. Staff were excellent and really nice. The food from both the evening trolley and breakfast was delicious. The rooms are fabulous and ridiculously comfy. Bathrooms were immaculate. The rooftop area was lovely when the weather allowed for it. Location wise it’s perfect!
August 2021,"Great location, amazing staff!","Great staff, clean hotel, felt very comfortable covid protocols were in place. Great late drinks. Location ideal for shopping, dining, sight seeing! Quiet in the morning and great late night drinks. Very accommodating and helpful staff."
August 2021,Amazing return visit!,"This is our second visit to Hotel 41 and we will return! Nothing is too much trouble for the staff, the rooms are amazing - in the words of my 9 year old daughter - ""they feel like family"". We booked the junior suite and were upgraded to the executive suite - a lovely gesture. From the minute you arrive you feel relaxed. A drink on the rooftop bar is a must.  Hotel 41 is an experience like no other hotel experience - a truly unique and special stay!  We can't wait to our next stay!"
August 2021,Another great stay at No 41,"Stayed one night for our Wedding Anniversary and had another great visit. The staff are so friendly and nothing is too much trouble.A nice champagne welcome in the lounge/reception area, a beautiful room. The rooms are very comfortable with all you need at hand. The position of Hotel 41 is excellent, a little out of the West End and close to restaurants in all directions and tourist attractions if you need them. A late night bar for when you return from an evening out and breakfast until 11, perfect. We will definitely return, for longer next time however. you must go to No 41!"
August 2021,Best hotel staff we’ve ever met,"A stunning hotel . The staff and management were absolutely fantastic. Wish we hadn’t only booked one night! Will definitely be back for a longer stay. Stayed in the junior suite but sure all the rooms are fantastic. All staff members we encountered were really helpful, friendly and HAPPY!! Many thanks to everyone for making our stay so great"
July 2021,Perfection,"This is a fantastic hotel with amazing staff; I'm so pleased we found it! It's not only dog-friendly but our special chap was treated as well as any guest and really didn't want to leave! The rooms are lovely; clean, beautifully-decorated and extremely comfortable and the location and staff are unbeatable. We can't wait to return."
August 2021,Absolutely fantastic hotel,"Really not much to say about hotel 41 but 'fantastic'. On arrival we were welcomed at the front door and guided to the 5th floor for check-in. Checking in is completely different from any other hotel we have visited, we were sat in the lounge area and given a glass of champagne. The lounge area is beautifully decorated, clean and probably the freshest smelling room ever. Once checked in we went to our foom, our sons had a standard room with twin bed, again very clean and plenty of room for them. Our room on the other hand a split lever suit, is spacious, well lit and honest stunningly decorated. Honestly I can't use the words beautiful, gorgeous, wow and impressive enough when writing. During our stay the staff are probably the best I've ever had the opportunity to meet in all…"
August 2021,A hotel that undoubtedly goes above and beyond,I booked hotel41 for my partners 30th birthday. Hotel41 made it such a special experience. Thanks to all their charming staff for the best stay. I would not hesitate to recommend a stay to anyone looking for something that little bit special.
August 2021,"PURE HEAVEN  - TRULY 1st CLASS and 6 star, not 5.","Oh wow. Where to start. The welcome, so lovely...like coming home, but with a concierge at your front door! All of the staff were extremely friendly and professional in equal measure. They all wear white cotton gloves. As ALL staff were so wonderful, I am reluctant to single anyone out, yet Andrew (from Greenock) was particularly warm & attentive. A great check in experience with a rose champagne. It almost felt like an honour to hand over my credit card. The room was a reasonable size and excellent. Turn down service with attention to detail, such as towel/toiletry needs, chocs on pillow. The breakfast was divine. Try everything, it is all 1st class. Lots of afternoon and early evening treats, nibbles & small bites. On our 2nd night we didn't even go out for dinner, it was that…"
August 2021,A hidden gem in the heart of Victoria,"Having read all the impressive reviews of this Hotel, I was eager to see if it would live up to my very high expectations! We were greeted downstairs by a lovely girl on reception before being whisked upstairs to the executive lounge to check in. Steve (quite a character with a great sense of humour) supplied the very welcome champagne and canapés while we checked in. Our room was available immediately (a welcome surprise). Loved the gorgeous handmade chocolates which awaited us in the room with a handwritten note from the Manager welcoming us. It's these touches that I think elevate the Carnation Group above other 5 star Hotels. The room was gorgeous, the bed so comfy, the toiletries wonderful.  Our absolute favourite part of our stay has to be the afternoon we spent up on the…"
August 2021,"Chic, Comfortable & Friendly","We enjoyed our stay at this chic and comfortable hotel. It is noteworthy how especially kind, helpful and friendly all the staff were throughout our stay, which made for a very restorative time. We appreciated the welcome glass of champagne, delightful breakfast and the late checkout."
August 2021,A little gem in the city,"Fantastic hotel, the staff were friendly, helpful and attentive making us feel very welcome. A drink on arrival whilst checking in was a great touch, and evening drinks on the rooftop in the sunshine was an added bonus. Will definitely be returning soon."
August 2021,Small is Beautiful,"If your looking for a large brash hotel, then Hotel 41 isn't for you. This is a small Hotel that occupies the 5th floor only and only has a couple of dozen rooms. It's is an intimate experience where you're made to feel at home by the hugely attentive staff. This is very much a 5 Star Hotel. The only downside to my stay and I'm clutching at straws here was the location was taxi ride away from most of the centrally based bookings we had made but that's arguably not their issue. We also chose a Split Level Suite which had a small downstairs living area which we didn't use but again, that was possibly a poor choice on my behalf. I would highly recommend this Hotel and it is highly likely we will return!"
May 2021,A Little Hidden Gem! ,"I have just returned from a short weekend away with my 9 year old son in London. This was my son's first time visiting the capital, so I wanted to make it a little special.  Staying at Hotel 41 definitely contributed to making it a lovely weekend which we both enjoyed immensely. If you are looking for small intimate hotel with excellent attention to detail and service in general, I would definitely recommend 41. Both my son and I felt very looked after without any of the pretentiousness you can get in some 5 star hotels. My son is autistic so the calm and quiet of the hotel was a good contrast to the bustle of the city.  The staff are very friendly,  especially Andrew who will go above and beyond  to help, he is an absolute asset to the hotel! "
April 2021,Impeccable!,"How amazing to have had the most wonderful stay in London at Hotel 41.   From the initial booking to leaving everything was taken care of with such professionalism. The team at Hotel 41 are some of the most attentive and kind individuals of their profession.    The food was delicious from breakfast to lunch, canapés to dinner. With a vast arrange of drinks on offer along with a well thought out menu for food. My dietary restrictions were no trouble and I was very well catered for.   The staff were superb but a special mention to Steve, Erica, Svete, Lauren and Andrew. You along with the rest of Hotel 41 took such care of us and were so attentive. You really made our stay all the more enjoyable.  It’s not just the special touches that Hotel 41 provide (I won’t spoil it by telling…"
May 2021,Amazing,"What an amazing experience we had. Staff went above and beyond to make our stay unforgettable. The lounge was stunning, beautiful design. Perfect location. Very good breakfast and great cocktails. The room had superb facilities. We definitely will be back."
May 2021,Luxury hotel with great service,A hidden Jem in London on the 5th floor. Greeted with champagne as I checked in. The staff and attention to detail is exceptional. Breakfast was first class with a range of delicious options. Looking forward to the next trip.
May 2021,"Fantastic stay, outstanding service!!","The reviews aren’t wrong, the service at Hotel 41 is outstanding. I stay in lots of very nice hotels, all over the world and very rarely go out of my way to write a review. I couldn’t help myself with Hotel 41!  My wife and I checked in on Thursday and stayed until Sunday without the kids for a romantic, relaxing break. The first since lockdown 3.0    Upon check in we were helped up to the executive lounge, you are greeted with a glass of fiz.   The staff make this hotel so special, Andrew did a great job of welcoming us and remembered us from the first time we visited 18 months ago, so did all the other staff, checking you in, showing you to your room and making you feel comfortable. The ‘whenever/whatever’ button in your room does exactly what it says..... if you need…"
May 2021,Just Heaven !!,"First weekend after hotels re-opened following easing of lockdown and we we were blessed to enjoy a 2 night weekend stay at Hotel 41. It is just ""Heaven"". No stress. Just calm and serenity throughout our stay, and the best staff ever. Somehow amongst an incredibly warm, efficient and genuinely caring team of wonderful people , ""Andrew"" manages somehow to distinguish himself as just exceptional.  From the moment you arrive and have a glass of complimentary  champagne pressed into you hand, to the moment you (sadly) leave, the attention to detail is just perfect throughout.  We  especially love Breakfast served in the room which is just brilliant. Food great and staff take so much care to set up the table and to make sure everything is perfect.  Nothing is too much trouble for…"
May 2021,Wonderful in every way,"Every single member of staff went out of their way to make our night wonderful. The hotel is stunning, It is by far my most favourite place and we have already booked for July. The suite we were lucky enough to stay in was tasteful and immaculate with lovely touches like candles and petals for turndown and also a beautiful handwritten card with a cake for our anniversary. Just Perfect.  Thank you in every way x"
May 2021,Couldn’t recommend more,We had a night stay here with friends and it was flawless from start to finish. The staff are the best we’ve come across at any hotel and nothing is too much. The selection of snacks and extra touches were exceptional and we will definitely come back as soon as we can. The standards are so high and the staff are so professional whilst being friendly and paying so much attention to detail. Thank you to everyone for making our stay so special. If I could give you more than 5 stars I would
April 2021,An Amazing Experience,"We had the pleasure of staying at this beautiful boutique hotel to celebrate our wedding.  From the very first contact from booking and arriving at the hotel, everything was seamless and no trouble.  Upon entering the hotel the smell was divine, we were greeted at the lift by the receptionist and invited to check in with a customary glass of rose champagne.    Now that’s how you do check in !!  Our room was amazing fully appointed with the best smelling Floris toiletries.  This hotel is full of little surprises and extras.  Canapés and croque monsieurs with drinks in the evening.  The ever present and fully stocked plunder the pantry which was always different.    Our rate included an afternoon tea and what an experience that was, they have the most amazing pastry chef.   …"
May 2021,"Exclusive, unpretentious boutique excellence","The staff are simply incredible at this beautiful, discreet hotel in the heart of London. The rooms are perfectly appointed and generously equipped. A great choice of food and drink, including a wonderful breakfast. Highly recommended for anybody looking for some unpretentious, exclusive boutique excellence....and did I mention how great the staff are!"
December 2020,Truly the Most Magnificent Hotel in London,"I would highly recommend Hotel 41 (there is no other hotel like this one).  Where do I begin - The staff are the most customer focused, attentive individuals I have ever met - they will go over and beyond to ensure you have the best experience ever.  They will ensure your every need is met and they truly are the most genuine and caring individuals you will meet.  The check in process is amazing - always a special treat.    The rooms are fabulous and have an individual signature touch.  The cocktails and drinks are served with a smile and  always an interesting conversation.  The breakfast is delicious and every need is met.  Pancakes are truly amazing.  The Terrace is gorgeous where you must have a cocktail or two and soak up the atmosphere.  Genuinely my second home and my…"
April 2021,fantastic hotel,"for business reasons they booked me in this hotel, very comfortable room and nothing is missing, kind staff, impeccable room service. I thank the management for helping me solve a small personal problem."
February 2020,5 star boutique hotel,"Hotel has 30 room luxury boutique & a member of red carnation group. Flawless hospitality & free champagne on arrival, snacks around the clock , all rooms have free wifi & ipod docks, private club & attentive service."
December 2020,An experience beyond words,"We stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate my birthday, and what a treat!  From the moment we arrived we were treated to the most luxurious yet relaxed experience.   Welcomed with a glass of champagne, our registration card brought to us for signature, along with snacks, and then we're taken to our room where our bags were already waiting for us.  Our room was the Balmoral Suite and it's gorgeous - looking out on the Mews.  The bathroom is dated and an unusual configuration, but doesn't take away too much from the room.   The staff are just wonderful, we were never asked for a room number, they all knew us by name and all wished me happy birthday at various stages throughout the day.   It really felt like a home from home - if my home was luxurious, had an amazing fully stocked,…"
December 2020,Simply outstanding in the heart of London ,"We decided to stay at Hotel 41 as a treat to cheer us up after having so many plans scuppered throughout the year and what a great decision that was.   Everything about the hotel is first class, from the location (the Queen is quite literally a neighbour) to the greeting upon arrival, the welcoming staff and the luxurious room through to the abundance of sweet treats available 24hrs, the pre-dinner canapés and of course the option to “plunder the pantry” until 1am.   But the thing that sets this hotel apart from your usual 5 star hotel is the friendliness and approachability of all the staff. You expect professionalism at this type of hotel but it felt as if everyone went over and above and treated us as though we were old friends, which makes such a difference in making you…"
December 2020,Mr Bull,"One hundred percent perfect stay Nothing to complain about , what so ever Perfection at the highest level Already booked to go back Every single member of staff was amazing, and friendly  Thank you again👍👍"
September 2020,Amazing hotel - wonderful service,"We stayed here for our wedding night in September. From the moment we arrived the service was impeccable. We were greeted by a doorman who seemed to know who we were and whisked our bags away and directed us to the lobby. There, we were offered a complimentary glass of champagne and some delicious canapes (note, this is a standard part of their service, so all guests are offered this!). We were then shown to our room - we are a fairly young couple so had booked one of the most reasonably priced rooms, but found we had been upgraded to a suite which was worth about 3x what we had paid - we also had a delicious chocolate cake and box of chocolates in the room and pairs of slippers with his and hers bags for them. The upgrade was incredible, and the extras were such a thoughtful…"
December 2020,I promise that this is THE place to stay for that special trip away!!!,Well most of what I say here simply wouldn't do Hotel 41 justice. We stayed on Sunday 6th December for just one night but I so wish it was for longer. From the moment you arrive at the ground floor reception you just know that the beautiful hallway you know that you are going somewhere very special indeed!! From the gorgeous decor and luxurious furnishings everything feels quintessentially British and these guys just get it so right.  We arrived at 1pm and were greeted with what they describe as their tradition of a complimentary glass of champagne to help you adjust to your new surroundings. I have had worse greetings when checking in to a hotel for sure!!! We then enjoyed some afternoon nibbles in the residents lounge before being shown to our room which was a Junior Suite. We…
December 2020,Amazing weekend break,"Just back from a fabulous stay at Hotel 41.  The room was spotlessly clean and well equipped. During the turndown service the open fire was lit, a hot water bottle was placed in the bed and a candle lit in the bathroom. This made for a lovely cosy return.  The lounge is beautifully and tastefully decorated with a complimentary snacks area which was fully stocked with individually bagged and wrapped sweets and chocolates.  When we enjoyed our drinks by the fireside we were presented with canapés and squares of toasted sandwiches which were delicious.  The breakfast was perfectly cooked and presented and was on until 1pm which could be a bonus to many after a late night.  For me, the very best part of this wonderful hotel is its staff. Nothing was too much trouble for them. We…"
December 2020,Best hotel in London,"This hotel is absolutely phenomenal - I cannot fault it at all. The customer service is exemplary. I have stayed here four times now and I will definitely be returning next year. Each time I go they put little touches in the room welcoming me back, they even gave us a room upgrade.  Dean was absolutely fantastic. The staff are so attentive and it made my stay very memorable.  Thank you again hotel 41, see you all soon."
December 2020,An absolutely gem of a hotel,"We stayed for only one night for my 50th birthday and wow this hotel is wonderful in so many ways. The staff really make this hotel a cut above the rest. They are extremely attentive, they make you feel like you are their most special guest and remember details about what you said the day before, ask after how your day was and are genuinely interested in ensuring you are having a great stay. The hotel itself is superb, love the black and white theme and the smell from their own room spray is delightful throughout. All the little touches that they offer like the complimentary glass of champagne on arrival to the nibbles constantly available and the little box of chocolates in the room are lovely. The bed was extra comfy too! Special mention to David who served us breakfast, what…"
September 2020,Costly but lovely,Really enjoyed my stay there. Very beautiful and welcoming stay. The room was very big and beds were nicely arranged . My whole family enjoyed the stay. But the price is too much.it should be reduced .
December 2019,Charming Hotel in Westminster,"I traveled here pre-Covid but even if I were to go back, I would stay here as the staff were warm and very helpful and the rooms were immaculate. The hotel interior is very impressive and the rooms are modern and well-designed, retaining some period-like features that seemed original to the property.  There was an issue with my bathroom in the morning of check-out day, however, the staff were quick on their feet and allowed me to use a bathroom of an alternative room (I did not want to move rooms as I liked the room I was assigned to).   Their amenities were also great - the slippers were so fluffy with his and hers pouches to match.   I fell in love with their parlor-like space where breakfast was served, along with cocktails in the evenings. The cocktails were good and…"
November 2020,5 stars and more,"This is the second visit I have had to this fabulous hotel. Everything about the hotel is magnificent,  from the welcome at the door to the goodbye when you leave making you feel that you are the most cherished guests.  Every  member of staff extols the same exemplary level of courtesy and service at every opportunity. The Executive lounge is exquisite, intimate  and comfortable.   Our room,  an Executive King was spectacular, providing us with everything that we needed for our stay and much more including a scrumptious, chocolate celebration cake.  Hotel 41 is a jewel, in an excellent location,  to be discovered in London."
October 2020,"Elegant, cosy and warm","We were lucky enough to have chosen Hotel 41 for our wedding anniversary in October.  I had stayed in Red Carnation Hotels before in South Africa so was familiar with their exceptional customer service and warm welcome.  We were not disappointed.  From the moment we arrived it was as if we were their most important guests, though I know everyone had that experience.   Our room was stunning and had everything you could possible need including some fresh milk in the fridge which we had requested prior to arrival and a little chocolate anniversary cake.  The executive lounge is very cosy and comfortable with a wonderful fire and book lined walls.  If you like a small and intimate hotel in a wonderful location then look no further than Hotel 41.  We also ate at bbar restaurant (only…"
November 2020,5 stars hotel with a royal vibe,Pros  - Excellent service  - Super comfortable room  - Amazing Royal vibe  - Beautiful building inside and outside   - Lots of complimentary treats including ice cream and nuts.   - Excellent Wi-Fi   - Excellent breakfast  Cons  - Restaurant menu could have more options  - Missing a jacuzzi in the room 😊😊
November 2020,Belmond Pullman trip,"We stayed here because it was a short walk to Victoria station for our Belmond British Pullman train trip to Bath. The hotel was lovely, rooms fantastic, comfy beds, roaring fireplace. We loved the cosy lounge/reception area. The staff were all exceptionally friendly and genuine with it. They thought of every little detail there, I cannot think of one negative. It was the best shower ever and I loved their ‘raid the pantry’ idea, for late snacks. Brilliant! "
October 2020,Fabulous birthday stay,"Hotel 41 is the most wonderful 5 star hotel. Everything is sheer class, rooms,atmosphere, food and above all staff. During a 3 night break for my wife’s birthday we could not have been treat better, looked after better or felt more special. From start to end everything was perfect!"
November 2020,Quick staycation in London.,"Quick staycation in London!  My partner and I stayed at hotel 41 for the weekend. The word “stayed” in it self seems to suggest, a passing visit. And if you travel frequently like we do, a hotel can become somewhat of a lacklustre experience.    Hotel 41, however, is in itself an experience, that should be on everyone’s bucket list at least once in your lifetime. Read on, and I’ll walk you through how this hotel has successfully encapsulated the true meaning of hospitality!  Upon arrival we were greeted by the receptionist in the private reception hall on the street level. The moment the front door closes behind you, the city noise disappears instantly. Your eye is immediately drawn in by the carved wood panelling, the striking black and white marbled floors and gleaming brass…"
October 2020,Amazing service ,I recently stayed here with my girlfriend for her 21st and couldn’t have picked a better hotel.The service was amazing with all staff members wishing her a happy birthday and receiving birthday cake on arrival. The Rooms are beautifully decorated and the location is ideal and within walking distance of many desirable locations. Will most definitely be revisiting.
October 2020,Excellent hotel! Will certainlyCome back again!,"We recent stayed at 41 for our anniversary, the hotel and staff are amazing! The rooms are excellent and lovely. We enjoyed our stay so much we added an extra night. We will be back very soon and recommend it to all. We also did the picnic in the park, which is a lovely treat for couples, highly recommend as part of your stay. Certainly the best hotel in London, and worth every penny. We can't wait to come back and stay again."
October 2020,Impeccable Service & Hospitality ," We stayed for one night for my husbands birthday celebrations.  Check in with the added bonus of complimentary champagne!  The gorgeous decor, friendly and knowledgeable staff and all the little touches.  The executive lounge was a welcome refuge after a day out in London with coffee and homemade biscuits.  The level of service is second to none.  This will be a our new base when staying in London - absolutely loved our stay and will be back next month if Boris allows "
October 2020,If only all hotels...,"If only all hotels were like this. Ideal location, excellent accommodation, friendly, cheerful, efficient and knowledgable staff. First class catering and excellent guest 'perks'. More like a comfortable and welcoming club. No hesitation in recommending 41 to anyone looking for somewhere well above the normal 'luxury' hotel."
October 2020,5* and more...,"We chose to stay in London for the weekend as COVID meant we had to cancel our wedding and decided to make it a luxury experience. Hotel 41 is a very warm welcoming hotel in which the staff make the stay very personalised. Nothing was ever too much for any of the staff. My partner loved the evening turn down where they light the fire and add a hot water bottle in the bed ready for when you want to turn in. Breakfast is outstanding and the arrival experience was great. The hotel stuck to all the COVID rules and even catered the complimentary extras to our room as we were unable to stay in the lounge after 10pm. There was hand sanitizer around the hotel and the staff were always cleaning where other had sat and eaten as soon as they left the room. The rooms are cozy, bathrooms are…"
October 2020,Amazing!!,"We arrived at hotel 41 and from the second we arrived the service level and attention to detail was outstanding! Once we arrived we were treated to champagne and snacks. We were staying for my partners birthday and there was a birthday cake along with other little touches in the room which made it feel that little bit more special. The decor was stunning & we came back from dinner to the fireplace on in the room. I’d forgotten my hair brush and they went and bought one for me and delivered it to my room!! Amazing customer service, the little touches and extras make this hotel a hidden gem! We will definitely be booking again soon! Thank you for having us!! "
October 2020,Simply the best...,"If you want the best hotel, the best staff, the best service, the best food, then look no further. This hotel is the best. We've stayed in many 5 star hotels but after staying at Hotel 41, I'd say this is in fact a 5 star hotel and the others need to pull their socks up. If relaxed and friendly yet an exacting attention to detail is what you want then book here. We can't wait to return again and again."
October 2020,Lovely birthday treat,"An absolutely amazing hotel that puts other 5* hotels in their place.  From the “happy birthday” plate with a scrumptious cake in the suite, the tasteful decor throughout, the wonderfully polite, friendly and helpful staff, to the fantastic breakfast.....outstanding.    Nothing seems to be too much trouble for them and we really couldn’t recommend this hotel enough.    Thank you Lauren Hargrave and Andrew Muir and everyone who made our stay so memorable.  "
September 2020,Perfect refuge during difficult times,"My Wife and I have always agreed that the best hotel, in terms of service, that we have stayed at is the Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok. An opinion has not changed since we first stayed there +30 years ago.  That is until we stayed at Hotel 41. The service here is superb, from the warm greeting from all the staff on arrival and whenever you see them around the hotel,  to the fact that nobody asks for any details when you order anything but the bill is correct when you leave. No idea how they do this. The hotel itself is very cosy and has the atmosphere and decor of an exclusive London club. The Covid precautions are appropriate and reassuring and don't detract from the experience. Finally now is the time to visit London, very few people around, you can see all the sites without the…"
October 2020,Slightly disappointed,"We were here for our 1st wedding anniversary and upon recommendation from our parents, so as you can imagine our expectations were high. We took advantage of the valet parking for £50 which although pricey saves a lot of time and hassle. One thing I would have liked, is that when we messaged the hotel to say we would like valet parking, they could have made us aware of the congestion charge now being applicable to weekends (this came into effect June 2020 apparently- how would a non-Londoner know this?) however upon checking-in, we were offered complimentary champagne and sat in front of the lovely fireplace and offered the complimentary snacks (Lindt chocs, nuts, Judes ice cream) whilst our bags were taken to our our room.   I was asked on several occasions (prior to arriving…"
October 2020,Brilliant place,"The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, we were treated with a glass of champagne on arrival, there were loads of complimentary perks, the food was amazing, the location is great for visiting the main attractions of London."
August 2020,Amazing,"What a fabulous place to stay, easy to get to, fabulous staff, amazing food and everything else you would want for a stay in London. The staff go all out to make sure you have everything you would like, anytime and nothing is too much trouble. Would recommend this experience to everyone. Ive already booked the next visit. Thank you to everyone at the hotel who made our stay very very special."
August 2020,Excellent hotel,We have just spent a couple of nights at Hotel 41 for a birthday celebration. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Staff extremely helpful and attentive. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and location of the hotel. We would definitely recommend and hope to return: it’s an excellent hotel.
August 2020,Another great stay.,"Second time at Hotel 41. Again, first class all the way. Thank you to all the staff, from cocktails to turn down, we loved it all.  The Covid arrangements were fine for us. Didn’t spoil our stay at all.  We will be back."
August 2020,5* for a reason - amazing stay!,"I stayed here last weekend as a weekend break. From the moment I arrived and the lovely woman at the reception knew exactly who I was before I spoke, I knew I would be in for a treat. The service is absolutely incredible, every single person is made to feel welcome and special.   I was taken in to wait in the Executive Lounge, which is an elegant room.  I was given the choice to have a complimentary glass of champagne or a soft drink. The executive lounge is also where the complimentary food is provided; this includes an array of snacks, a variety of different flavours of ice cream and a menu of food to order! The complimentary food is available from 8 pm - 1am (which is perfect for the midnight munchies!).   My room was spotless and the bed was incredibly comfortable! COVID…"
August 2020,Luxury Hotel,"Hotel 41 is a luxury hotel on the doorstep of Buckingham Palace. The staff are extremely attentive and do everything they can to make you welcome and ensure your stay is enjoyable. The rooms are very clean, comfortable and have all the luxurious finishing touches you would expect. Drinks are reasonably priced and treats offered during the day are delightful, the croque monsiuer is superb and the breakfast is the best I have ever had. I highly recommend Hotel 41 and can’t praise the staff that made our stay so enjoyable highly enough, a wonderful experience!"
August 2020,Fantastic Hotel and Service,"We stayed here for 1 night and we had royal afternoon tea included which was wonderful, the staff even opened up The Rubens tea room for us to sit opposite the Royal Mews. The staff were so lovely and friendly and we also ate in BBar next door which was great too. We would love to come back and stay again soon"
October 2019,41,The epitome of taste. Classy yet friendly. Pricey but well worth the tariff. Curry room is quiet the best Indian in London. Bar Guy went out of his way to make (mock) cocktails when I let slip I was a professional teetotaler.
August 2020,Amazing ,"We stayed here last weekend for our wedding anniversary. We wanted a change of scenery and a small hotel ideally. The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. We were treated like royalty, well we were on Buckingham Palace Road!!! We decided to drive, we normally use the train and tube when staying in London but used the hotels valet parking for £55 (24hrs). We were greeted at the door, bags out, simple as that... well worth the money.  We were kindly upgraded to a junior suite, located next door to the executive lounge/reception area, our room was fantastic as is the lounge area. We had a glass each of complimentary Lanson champagne upon arrival which is also a very nice touch.  There’s ice cream, sweets and chocolate along with more savoury produce in the evenings to…"
July 2020,"Perfect Birthday Celebrations, Thank You.","We visited  Hotel 41 for the first time on the 4th July 2020 for my Birthday, It was the day of opening up after Lock down and we were chuffed to be greeted with a Wonderful glass of champagne and Superb staff who made us feel at ease. We were upgraded to a Suite which was absolutely wonderful. Afternoon Tea was the best as was breakfast and we had dinner in the restaurant next door to the hotel which was also fantastic, this organised by the hotel for us as we wasn't sure what was available in the area. Cannot recommend enough, Wonderful staff, Lovely quiet relaxing rooms and lovely location.  We look forward to seeing you next year for our Wedding Anniversary."
August 2020,Simply the Best,"We have stayed at The Rubens on a number of occasions but have always wanted to experience Hotel 41 and we was lucky enough to do so this month as The Rubens closed due to low visitor numbers.  This truly was an amazing treat and words would never do this hotel justice.  We was welcomed by the most courteous staff who swiftly brought out a champagne trolley for us to enjoy a glass from, which clearly was a sign of things to come.  We was booked in for afternoon tea as part of our package which was as exquisite as ever. The whole experience was out of this world with the most scrumptious sandwiches and treats. All served on a truly royal stand   On checking in to our room we was upgraded to the Balmoral Suite which is like a room that we have never experienced before. The size…"
October 2020,Superb Hotel,"What a hidden gem! Fantastic facilities and rooms and the best customer service I have experienced in all my years of travel. We loved the ambience of the lounge and all the complimentary goodies, a shame we didn't try all the ice cream flavours, next time! Thank you for making our birthday stay truly memorable."
October 2020,Birthday Treat,This was the most amazing stay!! The staff were delightful and so lovely and could not have done more for us! ! We did not want to leave at all and was sad to go. We will definitely be back!! Thank you so much for having us!!!
October 2020,Sometimes its the little things...,"This hotel is superb for so many reasons but there are 2 main standouts: the outstanding service from each and every member of staff and the ""little touches"" that just set this a cut above. It starts with a glass of champagne and delicious little snacks on arrival and the five star treatment doesn't let up. From a candle being lit in your bathroom in the evening, and finding a hot water bottle has been put in your bed whilst you are at dinner.... through to a complimentary power juice shot in the mornings and Wedgewood china for in room hot beverages. I love how everything is 41 monogrammed - right down to the froth on your cappuccino. The staff were attentive, professional, polite and great fun too. Am already looking for an excuse to go back...."
October 2020,Impeccable service and  generous hospitality,"I stayed in Hotel 41 for business purposes with fellow colleagues for two nights.  The hotel group boasts that they are renowned for impeccable service and generous hospitality and I honestly couldn't describe it any other way. So I decided to second that in my review title and description.  We work for a translation company and we are all globe trotters so we are used to travelling A LOT, and going on many executive meetings around the world. I speak for all my colleagues when I say that we have all never had an experience like we had at Hotel 41! It is one to remember and a 5 star review is the least we could do!  What is very impressive, is how every member of staff across the hotel, restaurants and bars are all trained to the same level of impeccable service. It's so…"
October 2020,Birthday Stay,"Stayed for one night at Hotel 41 for my Birthday.  We were upgraded to a Junior Suite and welcomed with Champagne on arrival.  The service was immaculate and the staff were excellent and friendly, making my birthday very special."
September 2020,Mini moon stay,My husband and I got married Last weekend and spent our mini moon in this amazing hotel. The staff were helpful and kind and the hotel beautiful. We could not fault anything and felt like royalty staying here. I could not recommend more. If you want to stay somewhere stunning with top notch service and in a fantastic location then this is the place. Thank you hotel 41 for making our weekend unforgettable.
September 2020,5***** service and beyond!,"Stayed 4 lovely nights at Hotel 41 in an exec twin room.  From the moment we arrived, and were welcomed with champagne and snacks, to the time we left I felt nothing was too much trouble for the staff.  Want your breakfast teapot and cup warmed?  You only have to mention it once and it's all done like magic every morning thereafter.  And not once did we have to give our room number when ordering drinks.  They just know!   It's not pretentious, it's not stuffy - it feels very welcoming whoever you are.  Would love to return - trying to persuade him indoors that Xmas would be fab!!"
August 2020,Wonderful luxury in the middle of a fairly miserable 2020,"As soon as travel restrictions were lifted we knew this was where we wanted to be, our favourite city centre hotel. Things have obviously changed a bit - you need to wear masks in the hall, the ""plunder the pantry"" buffet is now table service - but it is still a little oasis in the midst of the busy city, even more so now with the fantastic new rooftop terrace.  Immaculate service as always - I have no idea how they always know our names and rooms but there was no need to show a credit card or key for our entire stay - we asked for whatever we wanted, it was promptly delivered and seamlessly turned up on the bill when we left.   We had such a perfect weekend we came back a few weeks later for another weekend."
September 2020,I cannot tell you enough how much I LOVE this hotel!,"If you’re looking for a great location, wonderful service and a beautiful hotel, stay here. Honestly I am blown away with how amazing the staff is here. I will definitely be coming back. The rooms are so comfortable and the lounge is stunning. We absolutely love it here."
September 2020,Service beyond the imagination,"Stayed as a 60th birthday gift. Didn’t know what to expect but service started before we went in the building, greeted by wonderful gentleman who Knew our name and got our bag and car parked. To a lady who took us to the lift. Up to 5th floor to be greeted by name and sat and served champagne and nibbles while they checked us in and told us the process of getting food and drink and breakfast in the morning. They took us to our room and said they upgraded us to a suite. I was overwhelmed,. A mini cake, chocolates and massive room. I was choked up. Every time we went to the lounge I felt like a princess. The service was the same for everyone. The staff here work tirelessly, we saw a number of people enter the lounge at once. They worked fast to ensure we were well looked after and…"
July 2020,Luxurious central London sanctuary,We enjoyed a superb stay at Hotel 41 this weekend to celebrate my husband’s birthday. From start to finish staff did their utmost to offer friendly but professional service. Doors open magically with staff anticipating your next move. Hotel 41 benefits from a glorious roof top bar with spectacular views across London and the executive lounge offers a huge array of complimentary treats and a wonderful champagne trolley.  The location is perfect as there is so much within walking distance there is no need to worry about cabs or the underground at the moment.  With just 33 rooms and not open to non-residents the hotel has the feel of a private members club but without being stuffy.  Highly recommended if you are looking for a special and intimate hotel in central London for a post…
July 2020,A real discovery,Got transferred from the Milestone to Hotel 41 - what a pleasant surprise! Friendly staff with excellent suggestions for things to do and places to go. The room was perfect (got a free upgrade to their junior suite) and the rooftop bar is amazing. Snacks available throughout the day (ice cream as well:) and the best vodka martini I ever had. 10 out of 10 would recommend.
May 2019,Probably the best boutique hotel in London ," The hotel's English butler service is phenomenal. The room is a historic British style. The Executive Lounge offers all-day food and beverages in addition to breakfast. In addition to the charge, the wine is free, and a delicious hot dish is served during dinner. It’s a bit pricey, but definitely worth the money. "
May 2019,Treasured Memories at Hotel 41,"Unfortunately, the virus forced us to miss another special stay at 41 as we planned for early May 2020. 41 is truly is a home away from home. The people, the service, the ambiance, the special touches and treatments, the list goes on and on.   On our first visit, our honeymoon, we were offered the two level Conservatory suite and all the amazing extras that come along with the suite (including a glass ceiling to watch the stars at night). Champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, red roses, and romantic bubbles all truly delighted the senses.  We have been back many times since, but never managed to stay in such an elaborate and spectacular suite, but fingers crossed it will be available on one of our future visits. Since it is a very small boutique hotel, booking in advance is…"
February 2020,Your own personal palace.,"If you want to go somewhere special and really be looked after, there's nowhere better to go. It's like staying in your own personal palace full of lovely staff. Nothing is too much trouble and it's a little secret so great we don't really want to tell you about it."
March 2020,Excellent service in difficult times,"I have had to cancel my UK trip and stay at Hotel 41 due to the coronavirus and the travel advisory from the Canadian government. I had already prepaid a non-refundable fare for four nights through Expedia. I must command the utmost professionalism of the team at the hotel during this difficult time. Due to the rapidly evolving situation, there was some confusion and misunderstanding (I didn’t realize I was eligible for cancellation insurance until the government officially advised against travel, etc), and truth be told I was feeling quite stressed having to handle all the cancellations for the trip. They were amazingly patient and helped me with what I needed without having to go back to Expedia again. I imagine this is an incredibly difficult time for the hotel and the staff…"
March 2020,Remembering the best of times,"One of my fail proof strategies for a pick-me-up is to daydream about the wonderful experiences I have been fortunate to have.  Like most people around the world I have had to change my plans - perspective and reality check.  I should have been packing for myself and my son to travel to the UK for a very very special birthday party (think 50yrs of life, 18months of planning), instead I am preparing to be on the medical front line in Australia.  So I am daydreaming about where I would have been instead. About now I would be burning up the last of my adrenaline after our 26 hour commute and about to have the doors opened for me at Hotel 41, where we would have been greeted with helping hands, warm smiles and open hearts.  The foyer would have smells of fresh bread and coffee, a…"
March 2020,Perhaps my favorite hotel yet,"This is absolutely one of the finest hotel experiences we have ever had and we have had some fabulous experiences.  The staff goes above and beyond to exceed all expectations.  Our room was lovely with all the appointments with one could need.  It would be difficult to name one staff member as every single staff member was beyond warm and helpful.  they made me coffee at 3 AM and helped us rearrange our travel when the coronavirus created havoc on a global level. They made a cozy fire in our room and brought a toasty hot water bottle that my daughter clung to in this uncertain time.  Sadly, we had to cut our trip short but the staff listened to our woes, made my daughter hot cocoa while Mommy was on the phone for hours trying to get us out of the country, and rearranged dinner…"
March 2020,Superb Service,Had a fabulous stay in hotel 41. It is a small boutique hotel in a wonderful location. From the moment we arrived we were made feel so welcome by every staff member. The service from everyone was superb nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was delicious and all the nibbles supplied all day was a wonderful treat. Highly recommend and we will definitely be back!
March 2020,Best hotel in London,I’ve stayed in many hotels in my time but none were as special as 41. From the moment we arrived we were well cared for. Everyone was really pleasant and all went the extra mile. A gem of a hotel in a mediocre world
January 2020,The BEST in London,"Stellar service and amenities. Every time we had a “wow” moment and thought it couldn’t get any better, they surprised us with even more amazing things. We didn’t want for anything. I’ve stayed in many London hotels, and this is the zenith! Can’t wait to come back."
January 2020,Just as everyone says,"The quality and amenities were every bit as good as advertised and reviewed. We have stayed at their sister hotel, Rubens, just about every year for there last few and love that. We decided to stay at the 41 for a special occasion. We used it as out ""home."" We have been out to dinner many times in London and don't eat a lot at dinner, so we just stayed there for the things they put out in the evening and had drinks. We feel like we got to know their friendly staff, and that made it even more comfortable each evening.  Since we didn't go out, we declined the turndown service except for one night. Should have got it every night because that was the BEST. Allow it to be done... The only negative, and this is personal to us, is how much they want to help. We don't need much…"
January 2020,"Hidden Gem, Outstanding service","Outstanding service from the moment you make a reservation to when you walk in the door staff make you feel welcome and try accommodate your every need.  It's a smallish hotel (40 rooms) and no real signage on the exterior.  They keep a receptionist in the lobby to direct you to the upper floors where rooms are and check in occurs.  There is an executive suite available for guests to access a light breakfast, quick snacks and water, coffee or tea during the day (tea and small canapes are offered early evening as well), drinks and other food are available as well.  Rooms are tastefully decorated in black and whites with all the amenities you would come to expect in any hotel.  They are good sized and comfortable.  Wake up calls are personally done with a knock on the door and…"
January 2020,We just love this place!,"Hotel 41 has fortunately become our home away from home. We love their philosophy of service and the attention to detail. Even the smell of the hotel is great!!! The staff are so friendly helpful and attentive. The evening pantry is fab, although never really needed....it has to be done! Best place to stay in London  "
January 2020,Absolutely fantastic,"Incredible hotel with amazing staff. This was our third visit and the standard is higher than ever. The staff are quite exceptional, the care and attention we received makes other hotels look poor. We arrived for my wife’s birthday and we had a cake in the room which had been upgraded to a suite! We had a lunch in b bar which is part of the Rubin’s and again exemplary service. We’re already considering staying in the summer and will defiantly return next January."
February 2019,Impeccable Service!,"Actually stayed her on our first trip to London in 2017 and we loved it. It was a Last minute trip, so we booked our room as we boarded the plane. Hotel 41 held our room without even taking a credit card to hold it, staff was soooo nice. Close to buckingham palace and some good restaurants. "
January 2020,Fantastic,Definitely the best hotel I have ever stayed in. Once again our stay surpassed our expectations.  The hotel is amazing. It's like a tranquil oasis in the middle of london. It's so nice we ended up spending most of the day relaxing in the beautiful lounge. Thanks so much to all the staff for making my husbands birthday extra special. We just can't wait to come back.
January 2020,Impressive hotel and extraordinary service!,This hotel I would love to give 10 stars!! They have superb in hospitality!! We stayed in many hotel but I would give hotel41 the best of the hotel !!many five star hotel should have learn this kind of hospitality but many place still act like robots  We stayed for 2 night accually I should decide to stay here the whole trip we were in UK anyway we will surely come back for the special room that have roof glass can see the stars that what the staff told us !! By the way we got upgraded to the room the have 2 stories ♥️👍
January 2020,Customer service experience,"I am soon to be staying at Hotel 41.  Positive feedback online led me to call to make an enquiry which turned into a booking.  Reason for my review is that the customer service experience delivered by Kirsty, the hotel's Reservations Manager, was first class. Working in management myself, I know it can be an arduous role sometimes, but the phone call to make my booking was informative, swiftly handled and a smooth process.  Already excited to for my visit to this hotel.  Thank you Kirsty & Hotel 41!"
January 2020,Brilliant stay for our wedding anniversary,"Cannot leave a high enough review. What a gem of a hotel. Absolutely fabulously appointed small boutique hotel, wonderful staff so accommodating and friendly. We stayed overnight for our wedding anniversary and the staff and hotel spoilt us beyond any expectation, upgraded our room, special anniversary cake and congratulations but even had it not been our anniversary the staff were amazing and the room lovely. Perfectly situated to walk into LONDON. Will be recommending to my friends as know they will love it. Thank you hotel 41"
November 2019,We enjoyed a three night stay at the 41,"It is a unique botique hotel that has a great location accross from Buckingham Palace. It is within walking distance to many of the historical sites in London. The Hotel itself is very comfortable and we had a two level suite, sitting room below and bedroom above. Plenty of space for the two of us. 'There was an executive room for snacks and drinks. The staff was excellent and provided friendly and fast service. It was a great stay."
November 2019,Fantastic,As this hotel won best hotel in London we booked it for our anniversary as a treat.   But with such great reviews I had high expectations and I was not disappointed.  It is the best hotel we have ever stayed in.  Yes it’s a considered purchase but omg it’s worth it.  Small things like a hot water bottle in your bed make such an enjoyable stay.  We are looking to make this our annual anniversary celebration
November 2019,Exceptional!,"The service was simply exceptional.   Friendly, attentive, proactive, generous, warm, welcoming and with great attention to details. The executive lounge has an amazing vibe, warm yet luxurious, rich but not overwhelming, intimate though you still feel part of the scene. And the treats... they just keep flowing in. In 3 words - above and beyond!  The room is great. Filled with all the amenities one might want. Super comfortable bed and pillows, slippers, good A/C, sound proof, separate bath and shower, big and soft towels, robes, very dark when your turn off the lights, choice of morning papers, sweet treats, espresso machine and water (still and sparkling). Seriously, not much can be improved.  Well done."
November 2019,Anniversary ,"We stayed here for two nights on this occasion because one didn’t feel enough last time, on our next visit we hope to stay for three!  We can not recommend this hotel enough from the glorious decor to the wonderfully friendly, helpful and attentive team of professionals who work here to make your every moment as relaxing and enjoyable as humanly possible.  From the welcome glass of champagne at check in to the delicious complimentary range of food offered at various times of the day, Hotel 41 try to make you feel at home (if you lived in such a beautiful place!) and with all the effort put in by the fabulous team they certainly succeed! We couldn’t dream of living a real everyday life like this although I’m sure some of their guests are this lucky but the main reason it works so…"
November 2019,Birthday celebrations,"Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic - says it all. This hotel goes above and beyond. Cannot recommend this hotel enough for service, attention to detail, comfort and style. The hotel went out of its way to make our stay for birthday celebrations so special. A particular mention to Andrew & Steven for their attentiveness and enjoyable company. I particularly liked my hot water bottle in my bed when we arrived back from the theatre -little touches like these make this such a stand out hotel.  Thank you again everyone at hotel 41."
November 2019,"Super friendly , highly professional oasis in central London","This property is superbly situated near theatre and Buckingham palace and although is in the heart of the city is very calm and quiet. The staff are amazing , warm and friendly but impeccable service and great attention to detail.  Taking time to find out special requests like transportation , bar service to the room etc . Everything arrived on time and in good order and they were lovely touches to like and honesty bar snack buffet and even hot water bottle in your bed when you arrive back at the end of the night. All in all great service and would definitely stay here again if I was needing to stay in central London!"
November 2019,Amazing stay from start to finish,We have stayed in some amazing hotels all over the world. Not only is this hotel a beautiful find not to be missed with great food and complimentary snacks. I can honestly say this the customer service and overall standard of service in general for this hotel was the best I have ever experienced not only in 5 star hotels in the uk . (We usually stay in the savoy or the shard) But I would go as far as to say the best on a overall all international level. From the second we arrived to the second we left. We had 24/7 service of the highest standard from everyone we met. Special mention to Andrew who went above and beyond to make our stay extra special and his professionalism along with his people skills was one of the main reasons I am writing this review. I can not recommend this…
October 2019,Delightful,Staying at this hotel is like surrendering yourself to the ministrations of an attentive Nanny. You feel cosseted and cared for without being smothered. Just lovely. The staff are uniformly kind and intuitive and I can not recommend more highly
November 2019,The best home from home.,"Decided to break our “stay at the Savoy” tradition and try a new establishment ...  I’m not one who leaves reviews often, stayed at many five starts throughout the world...  this one deserves my comment.  From the friendly greeting to the hospitality from start to finish. The staff could not do enough.  We had the conservatory suite... beautiful duplex arrangement more than satisfied me.   The “executive lounge” sat by the fire with tip top service and array of canapés, drinks and friendly conversation in the most beautifully ambience ...  Particular mention to Andrew, he was an amazing host and the most engaging conversationalist.  I know where I am staying from now on each time I am in town...   Can not recommend enough.   It is also worth a mention that I have unwittingly…"
October 2019,Narnia is Hiding in London,"Behind a door on Buckingham Palace Road is a hidden world of calm, sophisticated luxury. Part of me wants to tell you about it, and part of me would like it to remain a secret! Hotel 41 is as wonderful as everyone says it is: a place to hide away from the busy noise of the city; a place where the service is unparalleled; a place where nothing is too much trouble; a place to tell your friends about (especially friends who you think deserve to have a wonderful few days in a magical world tucked away behind a simple glass panelled door)."
July 2019,Where everybody knows your name 🎶,The London Series! Could not have picked a more appropriate Hotel for a hospitable stay in London. The moment you enter - the greeting is amiable and professional. Followed by a personal check-in with champagne service. All very nice - but what is more impressive is the personal attention to detail that is afforded each guest by each member of the staff. This type of service encourages a friendly atmosphere that makes one want to revisit! So I am planning another trip with my husband so he can experience “plunder the pantry “ at midnight! PS the location is fabulous.
November 2019,"Distinguished Service, Exceptional Accommodations and Historic Location","We made our yearly pilgrimage to London to celebrate our 30th anniversary and wanted an exceptional hotel. We have stayed with the Red Carnation family before and wanted to have a special experience for this trip so Hotel 41 was our choice. Hotel 41 exceeded our expectations. The location across from Royal Mews, Buckingham Palace and short walk to Victoria Tube and Train station was convenient to numerous historical and tourist spots as well as many dinning options. The breakfast at the hotel offered many options and the kitchen was very accommodating to our request. The afternoon scone and snack bar provide a quick pick me up and the English tea choice made for a nice afternoon break.  The room accommodation where truly 5 star. From the plush bedding, heated bath towels, fire…"
April 2019,Luxury and Location,"Room Quality: 4/5 Front Desk ( Check in & Check out Experience): 4/5  F&B including IRD : 2.5/5 Housekeeping of Hotel: 5/5 Vibe : Mixed Amenities:   Love the entrance to this hotel, very discreet. Really comfortable rooms with a lot of amenities of offer. What set them apart was their service, thoroughly consistent throughout our stay. Room for improvement in f&b though. Again very good location."
November 2019,Truly amazing experience,"We stayed at hotel 41 for an extended weekend and it is simply the best hotel I have ever stayed at. Their service, kindness and willingness to make our stay just perfect was top notch. I have never experienced anything like it. We will definitely be back again next year. Many thanks to the entire staff for a truly amazing experience."
November 2019,Very special! In a positive way... ,"Stayed here for a weekend. Kind of discreet entrance. You take the elevator to the fifth floor, where all rooms and a wonderfully traditional lounge, including reception desk, bar and snack buffet, are located. Very attentive and friendly staff everywhere. It feels like being at somebody’s home, in a very positive sense. We had a junior suite, mezzanine style, which we really liked. Traditional interiors with a quirky touch. Well equipped in all aspects. Impeccable service. Only reason for rating 4/5 and not 5/5, is that the price level is high, also with London standards... Guess we would stay here again though... "
November 2019,Weekend in London,"Because of extremely high ratings on TA my sister and I decided to stay in hotel 41 during a recent weekend in London. Location of the hotel is convenient, close to a tube station. First welcome was very pleasant, and introduction to the hotel facilities was informative completed with a glass of champane. A room was comfortable, with everything you can wish including a plate of frutes  and sweets. Breakfast had a great variety of hot choices but we missed fresh vegetables on cold meniu. Keeping in mind that it is a 5 star hotel, a glass of proseco or champane would be a must during a breakfast. I would not consider very professional to serve toast with eggs and pancakes by breakfast staff at the same time because a second dish became cold until I start eating it. Staff of tha…"
November 2019,The best,"We have traveled to many hotels and thought we had great service and amenities. But Hotel 41 has topped them all. The staff is considerate and helpful and welcoming, every. day. Not a day went by without them doing a multitude of things that made our stay even more perfect. They go 100% on anything and everything.  We cannot wait to return there. I wouldn’t consider staying at any other hotel in London."
November 2019,Great Hotel,Very special boutique hotel... terrific location for most activities.. staff couldn't be more helpful and welcoming... we stayed here a number of years ago and it was wonderful then and has not changed! Would highly recommend!
November 2019,Attention to detail ,"This hotel’s attention to detail is impeccable. On entering you are met by a lovely smell as well as a friendly person at the desk.  You’re introduced to the reception area & a welcoming glass of champagne.  Our room was beautiful! They have thought  of everything you may need (I won’t ruin your lovely surprise)  The bath & shower - could’ve stayed in their for hours.  The bed - stunning & so comfy and were turned down (won’t ruin surprise number 2)  In the evening there’s delicious food available .... I only have one criticism & that is with the reception being on the 5th floor, this is where you eat. I felt I was imposing on people eating their breakfast and when it was our turn to eat, we felt we were being ‘watched’. Would I stay here again? Absolutely!   "
November 2019,WOW! This is just a fantastic and special hotel,"Firstly the location is ideal for London Eye, Westminster etc but as soon as you walk through the door you enter somewhere very unique and charming.  Staff so helpful and genuine, rooms the most comfortable we have every stayed in, and the fire burning blissfully away when you come in from the cold was very welcoming. The only hotel I have been in where a hot water bottle is put in the bed with his/her slippers by the side.The executive lounge offers a very fine choice of wine and spirits as well as beers and soft drinks.  The ambience of the room encourages you to just wind down and relax, horderves and snacks in abundance throughout the day and evening.  Breakfast menu offered something for everyone and you could even add your choice of what you wanted.  The standard of food,…"
September 2019,THE place to stay in London,"Small, charming, friendly and just down the street from Buckingham palace. Enough free buffets that you don't need to leave the hotel for meals. Rooms are decent size for Europe and kept spotless. They will pick you up and deliver you to LHR in a most comfortable S class Mercedes for a reasonable fee."
September 2019,Best ever hotel ,"Stayed in the conservatory suite for three nights on there stay one night free offer.as has been said by so many people this place is amazing.the suite is lovely on two levels and with everything you could possibly want and luxury toiletries.you feel at home from the moment you arrive sipping complimentary champagne and snacks while the staff take the time to engage with you and get to know your likes and needs,love everything about it as it is a peaceful haven amongst the business of central London.the Leopard Bar next door is also worth a mention with a great champagne menu and a lovely female jazz singer.back to the hotel though it is so good that i have cancelled a November booking i had at another top hotel & am returning here instead.thanks for looking after my wife and i…"
September 2019,A gem.,"There are not enough superlatives to describe this gem just a few blocks from Buckingham Palace.  The room decor and attention to detail are outstanding.  Food quality and variety in the lounge is excellent.  But what really sets Hotel 41 apart is the warm personal service.  You know when hospitality staff is faking it, and they definitely are not faking it here.  The smiles are genuine and the warmth radiates from everyone.  They are like a family taking care of family.  By day 2, everyone knew our names.  This is the best hotel my wife and I have ever visited, and we will definitely be returning."
September 2019,Second time but hopefully not the last.,"I really love this hotel. I visited them for the first timed in May 2018 and also last week. This hotel really made serious damage, because when I stay at other hotels, can not help but compare. The 41 has set the benchmark very high. I was very happy to see that the same staff was present since my first visit. This alone tells me that is very likely that the staff are happy to work there and there is no personal turnover like most places. The hotel is great, the location too, but the staff it what really makes the difference. I enjoyed talking to everyone of them, part of this trips is about meeting people and see their work. I always learn a little something from everyone. That is why traveling is an enriching experience. I want to thank all of those who were involved during…"
September 2019,Superb boutique hotel,"There is a reason this has been the #1 hotel in London for so many years.  I think the staff has a lot do do with it, particularly the younger staff and the concierge help.  We enjoyed Maria and Mateo!  There was an older gentleman in charge of the afternoon lounge service that was more than a bit stuffy and just did not seen to fit in with the rest of the smiling faces that we saw there.  It is VERY quiet, rooms have great air conditioning, the bed was extremely comfortable, the breakfast buffet was excellent.  For a peaceful, high service stay I am not sure you could do much better."
September 2019,These are a few of my favourite things,I  have stayed at the Burj in Dubai & the Versace in Australia but hotels in London have been commonplace TILL NOW. Why should U stay at Hotel 41? It depends on yr priorities. If u want to beuh treated  like a queen or king & staff who are eager to indulge yr every whim come here.Let me elucidate.  My husband was seriously I'll & was only able to eat normally since March.When I told  the hotel  he loved cornbeef they incorporated it in the canapes. .U get a glass of champagne on arrival.There are canapes at 5pm  snacks available all day. A hot meal salad & dessert  in plunder the pantry from 8.30 to 1am. When our transfer failed to materialize a staff member rang the company & then went round the back to find the transfer driver asleep.  Another staff member organized our hop on…
September 2019,Husband and wife,Was absolutely fabulous. Great room decor top notch staff impeccable and food pantry fun to raid. Will return again in future location handy to central London restaurants at sister properties excellent and Gabriel made great kahlaha coffee according to wife
August 2019,It Doesn't Get Any Better Than 41,"Spent 3 nights here before a four week North Atlantic cruise.  I have stayed at a lot of hotels in my lifetime.  Without a doubt, this was the VERY BEST.  If you need a hotel in London, stay here.  Stayed at the Jefferson Hotel in Washington DC a few years ago.  That was great, 41 was way above that.  Very small hotel, everyone knows your name, not stuffy at all.  Totally excellent customer service from the entire staff.  Super clean and plenty of room in Room 1.  If I ever make it back to London, I will not have to look at any other websites, other than 41.  London was a blast, 41 was in a great location and even booked events and transportation, including picking up at LHR."
June 2019,Wonderful Hotel Amazing Staff,"Beautiful hotel, the staff is incredibly helpful- our driver the hotel arranged Eddie was amazing, he took us everywhere in the English countryside we wanted to get to and we were so comfortable in the beautiful Mercedes car we rode in, and he was very friendly."
September 2019,Exception Luxury & Service,"My husband and I spent Labor Day Weekend at Hotel 41 and could not have been more pleased! Every detail was carefully orchestrated, from champagne upon arrival (or mimosas in our case as it was 8AM :-), to a luxurious pillow menu, to unique goodies left on our bed at turndown service. The staff were lovely and incredibly accommodating and we could not get enough of the lounge/pantry. As is clearly a theme throughout all reviews, the hotel prides itself on offering delicious bites and an extensive wine/cocktail list throughout the day and late into the night - which we found ourselves enjoying post midnight more than once! It was such a treat to return to the hotel and feel right at home and this speaks to the lack of pretension associated with such high standards and such well…"
April 2019,Incredible customer service,"This boutique luxury hotel is uniquely situated on the 5th floor of an older building across the street from Buckingham palace.  The staff welcomes guests with champagne at check-in.  We celebrated our 25th anniversary during our stay, and were surprised to find a cake in our room for the occasion.  The hotel recommendation of Rules restaurant for our anniversary dinner was perfect.  You can’t beat the personal service you receive at Hotel 41."
July 2019,Perfect place to stay in London,"We were fortunate to celebrate our 40th Anniversary at Hotel 41, and it was worthy of the occasion; from the nicely appointed room, to the attentive staff at every turn, and finally to the wonderful breakfasts, tea, and evening spreads, it is a hotel unmatched in our lifetimes. Especially enjoyed the interactions with Steve and Stefan, who made us feel like family and not guests. The hotel is located in a great part of London, with easy access to most of the city's attractions, but really, why would you want to leave? We will be back!"
July 2019,Simply Wonderful,"We wanted somewhere special for our wedding night, the photos and reviews were so good we treated ourselves for our special day, albeit booking a regular room. From the second we arrived, we were treated like royalty, from the doorman taking our bags, to the complimentary champagne when signing in and for every single moment during our stay, every single member of staff very politely greeted us by name. Arriving at our room we were told that they had upgraded our room to the Conservatory suite, which was beyond our wildest dreams, it was utterly perfect, down to every tiny detail.  We had dinner in the English grill (again with a complimentary bottle of champagne) which was delightful.   Finally returning to our room, to be greeted with scattered rose petals, candles, soft music…"
September 2018,If You Like Horses and Alice in Wonderland,"This private hotel is pricy but worth it.  When we first arrived,,, kind of strange, the lobby decor reminded me of Alice in Wonderland. Got lost several times trying to find our room, the hallways being narrow, color scheme, felt like a maze, hard to explain, but cool.  It's not your ordinary hotel, that's for sure but lots of amenities. The top floor restaurant with a big skylight is always open for free snacks and deserts. You must pay for meals and room service but the staff is terrific and goes the extra mile. We stayed in a couple of their rooms, very cozy and warm decor. If you can stay on the top floor, I'd advise that as you can hear the cleaning of the rooms and walking back and forth, building structure is old.  Now, to the horses. Right across the street is the Royal…"
July 2019,Wonderful stay at our new favorite hotel!,"Have to admit that we were a little skeptical about whether Hotel 41 could live up to all the great Trip Advisor reviews, but it so deserves them!  First of all, the service was absolutely outstanding- usually you might note one or two people that stand out, but in this case every single staff person we interacted with made us feel welcome and like valued guests. The hotel is small, only about 30 rooms, so it has the wonderful feel of an intimate, luxurious inn, but it has all the amenities of a full size luxury hotel (in part due to it connecting through a discrete door in the lobby to a sister larger hotel property-The Rubens at the Palace-next door). In terms of the room, we booked the only room that was available at the time, an Executive King Room, and were pleasantly…"
July 2019,An absolute gem!,"I have been going on an annual trip with five of my high school buddies for more than 30 years now.  Typically, we stay at the club level at Ritz-Carlton hotels or at the closest thing we can find to that level of service. This year was our first foray to Europe.  My neighbor and travel agent recommended that we stay at Hotel 41 in London.  He has created a bit of a problem for himself, however, as I don't see how he can top Hotel 41.  What a hidden gem.  The executive lounge is exactly the set-up that we love, a warm and welcoming gathering place for us to hang out in between the day's activities.  The rooms were superb.  But most importantly, the staff was amazing.   Stefan, Patricia and Magdalena in particular were so warm, welcoming and personable that they became an…"
July 2019,Double visit!,"My favourite hotel in London and I got to visit it twice in a month. My husband and I enjoyed a fabulous weekend in June when we were so excited to see the beautifully refurbished roof terrace. A beautiful sunny day in a beautiful spot.   A few weeks later, I returned to 41 to meet up with my cousin and goddaughter who were over from the US. We started on the roof, where Stefan allowed Meaghan, my goddaughter, to perform the sabrage - opening our champagne bottle with a sabre. A really special ambition fulfilled.  We then went back downstairs for a delicious afternoon tea where both Stefan and Steve looked after us so well.  Thank you to Lauren for making all the arrangements and for making both occasions so memorable. The team at 41 are unique!"
July 2019,The best Boutique Hotel in London,"I’ve been staying in London hotels for the last 14 years and have never experienced such fantastic staff and service. The hotel itself is gorgeous and the location perfect for all the best London attractions but what stood out for me was the attention to detail and individual attention this hotel offers. It’s an absolute gem and would give it 6 stars if I could.  Thank you for a brilliant stay. Kate, Meg and 🐶"
July 2019,Par Excellence ,"      I can’t believe that it had been 15 yrs since we last stayed at this wonderful hotel. What a mistake and from now on, it will be our London home whenever we visit. The hotel is in a perfect location adjacent to Buckingham Palace so it is centrally located to many of the London districts. Boutique in style, this hotel is very classy, very comfortable. The rooms are extremely comfortable and fully appointed. You will not want for anything and if you happen to require anything else there is always the “whatever, whenever” hotline. The service at this hotel really is unparalleled and they always make one feel so welcomed and taken care of. The library which also serves as the lounge and breakfast area (and the breakfasts are delicious )is comfortable and serves all the snacks…"
July 2019,An absolute gem...,"I cannot think of enough superlatives to describe this absolute gem but I will try.  First of all the location is fantastic.  You are literally around the corner from Buckingham Palace in one direction and Victoria Station in the other.  The gorgeous St. James Park is right down the road.  The hotel staff couldn't have been more lovely or welcoming from the moment we stepped through the door.  All rooms as well as the Executive Lounge are on the 5th floor.  The Executive Lounge is basically where everything takes place--reception, breakfast, afternoon tea and evening snacks.  The lounge must be experienced to believe it.  The food is delectable.  Afternoon tea is so enjoyable and eloquent.  After a long day of touring, you must stop into the lounge for the most delightful…"
May 2019,A hidden gem,We have just returned from the most amazing stay at hotel 41.   My husband booked the hotel for a treat for our first wedding anniversary. If I’m honest I didn’t know the hotel existed but what a hidden gem!  The hotel is located on the fifth floor as it’s sister hotel next door accommodates the other 4 floors.   The theme of the decor throughout is black and white and is simply beautiful.  On arrival we was greeted with a glass of champagne and was advised we had been upgraded as it was our anniversary. Rather than a executive king room we was staying in the junior suite. What a treat!   The suite was amazing. Where do I start - we was most certainly home from home. Everything you need is available. 3 TVs to choose from with separate sky TV. A beautiful bedroom with a huge bed…
May 2019,Faling ill wasn't the plan but........,"Regular guests at 41, we arrived mid-morning and almost immediately after our welcome glass of champagne, left for a day out with friends.  Early to bed, we succumbed to a virus going around our grandchildren's school and spent a difficult night.  The next morning we informed Lauren, the Resident Manager, who despite having a fully hotel, managed to arrange for us to stay in our room for a second, unplanned night.  There was no way we could have dressed and packed, never mind changed rooms. During that day and evening, the staff could not have been more helpful and understanding, going out to collect medication, offering appropriate light meals and beverages and bringing endless supplies of water, etc whilst respecting our necessary privacy.  Falling ill away from home is always…"
May 2019,Best hotel experience of my life,"We treated ourselves to a night at Hotel 41 as we began our honeymoon so were flying from Heathrow the following day and wanted to start off on the right note. Boy were we not disappointed!  On arrival we were congratulated on our wedding and told we were being upgraded to the conservatory suite. We had booked one of their ""standard"" rooms (although nothing in this place can be called standard). The conservatory suite was OUT OF THIS WORLD. A king-size bed, a separate seating area, a jacuzzi bathtub, 3 TV's (one in the bathroom!) and best of all, a retractable canopy over the bed uncovering the conservatory roof so we could sleep under the stars (well, what stars you could see... this is London after all!)  But I'm getting ahead of myself. The hotel entrance is quite small and…"
May 2019,1st class,My wife and I spent 16 nights total in England and Scottland. We spent 2 nights at Hotel 41. The accomidations and service was 1st class. I would consider this hotel the best of the 7 hotels during our stay in the UK. The staff was very attentive and extremely friendly. Our two breakfasts and one late lunch were delicious. We stayed in the Balmoral Suite which was very spacious and well appointed.  The hotel had a special birthday cake under a glass dome along with an assortment of freshly baked chocolates waiting for us in the room. Thanks Gary 
May 2019,Loved it!,"I had an amazing three night stay (if way too brief!) Completely understand why this boutique hotel is rated so highly. From the luxurious, stylish and comfortable room to the lounge and pantry and the excellent attention to detail from staff, Hotel 41 is an oasis of calm and comfort centred in the heart of London."
May 2019,Still the Best!,"Another wonderful stay at 41! The personal service is attentive and everyone makes you feel extra special and addresses you by name. This time we chose s smaller executive room, which was very cozy, very nicely decorated and well furnished.  Can't beat the location close to Buckingham Palace, the Royal Mews, the Queens's Gallery, and St. James park. Great to relax in the executive lounge with champagne upon check-in, with drinks before dinner, after the theatre for something to eat from the pantry before retiring to bed and last but not least, for their elegantly presented breakfast. As Stefan recommends the Eggs Benedict, he describes it as the ""breakfast of champions"".  Our trip was cut short due to a family emergency but we look forward to returning, when we can stay longer…"
May 2019,A Wonderful Experience ,"It was a fantastic stay. The staff are attentive, friendly and welcoming. the afternoon tea is wonderful and the pantry is a brilliant feature. After coming back from a night out it was great to raid the pantry and have a nightcap. I have been fortunate and lucky to have stayed in many premium hotels all over the world and this was by far the best for me."
May 2019,Hotel 41 delivered the holiday of a lifetime!,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for 8 nights at the beginning of May for a birthday/ anniversary trip.  Hotel 41 is that calm sanctuary that keeps you refreshed and ready to face your day with energy and excitement. All this with true welcome for their city of London. This trip was a year in the making, and I had decided on Hotel 41 early on. About a week before our arrival, I began to get nervous and thought my expectations were too high for Hotel 41. I worried for nothing! They delivered an amazing holiday experience. Hotel 41 goes above and beyond in the service experience. It is as if they wish to provide you with lifetime memories.  For example, one night while chatting with Oris (name hopefully spelled correctly) we mentioned our potential plans for the next day and…"
May 2019,Our #1 hotel choice for London,"I've been to London numerous times, and had been lucky enough to stay in other 5 star places. Although the other hotels have better amenities (bigger bathrooms, etc), they really are outdone by the SERVICE provided by the Hotel 41 staff (not to mention that free pantry!!!). We didn't have to sign for anything (the staff makes sure they know YOU right from the get go), and any concerns are addressed immediately.  And the location is superb - right in front of the Buckingham Palace, 2 blocks from Victoria underground and the Big Bus stop right in front of the hotel.   And yes it's pricey, but you definitely get the value for your money. We will definitely stay here again when we go back to London town!!!"
January 2019,"Like staying with family, if your family is really wealthy","I'm not trying to be sarcastic. The staff was so attentive and so friendly it was like having family in London. The room we stayed in was decent sized, not one of the suites, but it had enough room for two sisters with a lot of luggage (we arrived after a cruise.) The amenities were fabulous and the location can't be beat. When we needed detailed directions (well, I did since I get lost easily and was trying to get to a pharmacy by myself) one of them even took me most of the way to my destination (by foot) and recommended places for me to shop while I was out and about. I wish I could afford to stay there again, especially during a warmer and drier season. But the hot cocoa in the lobby was always welcome and the blankets were warm and cozy."
June 2019,nice,“A great selection for a continental breakfast; more than I have experienced in other establishments. A very quiet room with a large and comfy bed. Lovely shower. Helpful and kind staff. Very good value for money.”
June 2019,Amazing hotel!,"I had high expectations for this hotel given the great reviews I read before travelling.  Here are the highlights of our 6-night stay: - lots of thick, high quality towels, excellent water pressure and terrific toiletries in the bathroom - friendly, approachable and helpful staff - excellent food and service at breakfast - the most amazing bed I've ever slept in (at the end of our stay I had to ask the brand; it's a Savoy) - very clean and pristine condition common areas and room - check-in and check-out were extremely efficient (check-in was accompanied by a glass of champagne) We also had the afternoon tea at the hotel one afternoon.  It was a wonderful; lovely sandwiches, scones and pastries accompanied by a wide selection of teas."
June 2019,Very British Hotel with Personalized Service,This is indeed a top class hotel with top level service! The lounge and the food were also amazing. We had a wonderful stay for our girl’s birthday celebration! Thanks all the friendly staff in hotel 41 and we strongly recommend this hotel!!
June 2019,Amazing Hotel and Amazing staff and fabulous location,We stayed at this beautiful hotel just over a week ago. I read all the write ups on tripadvisor and thought can it be this good ! Well it was and more !!  all staff from front desk on antry to check in to welcome drink  - everything. Room was amazing Staff super super friendly and helpful.Too many names to mention and dont want to miss anyone out.  I think we spoke to most of them at some time during our 24 hour stay.We will be going back for sure Would highly recommend.
June 2019,Deserves 6 out of 5,"Hotel 41 continues to be our most favorite place to stay in London.  It takes service and quality to the highest level and never disappoints.  This time it was a 2 night stay for a trip to Royal Ascot and we were given an upgrade to a room on 2 levels which was very charming and very comfortable.  As always we received the lovely warm welcome and champagne from Steve, who also gave us an excellent recommendation for dinner near Sloane Square.  The library lounge remains as comfortable as ever and the generous buffet bar was loaded up once again with lots of goodies.  But, the main stand out is always the staff.  Genuinely friendly, helpful and attentive but never intrusive.  Simply brilliant.  We just love it here.  See you again soon 👍"
June 2019,Feels like an English Country Home with an excellent Staff in the heart of London,"Hotel 41 is a hidden gem with only 30 rooms, it' s as if you have your own private home with an attentive staff. The location is directly across from the Buckingham Palace's Royal Mews where the Queen keeps her horses. An easy walk to see the changing of the Palace Guard and stroll through St James Park. Victoria Station tube is close by and it's also easy walking to many of London's best sites. It's intimate, personal, sophisticated yet cozy and comfortable."
June 2019,Wonderful service,Lovely boutique hotel and a great location for visiting Buckingham Palace. The service was perfect. Everyone knew our name and bent over backward for any request. It is a very small hotel and though beautifully appointed our room was small too. I would say the hotel was a little too sedate for my thirty something daughter. I thoroughly enjoyed it however.
June 2019,Fantastic Hotel ,This hotel is a different gravy ! I can see why it is rated number 1 hotel on trip advisor. Staff are exceptional and customer service is flawless. Free upgrade on arrival to a suite and the pantry in the lounge is a very unique idea.  We will be back  
June 2019,The best there is!!!! ,What an incredible hotel. The level of service is the best I have ever encountered. And the concept of the all-day pantry is a wonderful touch. Beautifully decorated rooms. The “whatever whenever” button on the phone is a piece of brilliance.  Bravo to all the staff for making this hotel stand head and shoulders above the rest.  
May 2019,One of the Best Hotels I've Ever Visited,"I'll just keep to bullet points to avoid rambling about this terrific hotel. - We booked the Junior suite and it looked even nicer in person and had so much more amenities in the room than a person would ever expect. My husband thought it was funny that I got excited over all the small things they thought of to provide for people. For example; They have a ""pillow"" menu with 10 options for pillows if you prefer something different than than the standard pillows on the bed (see my photos) - You are greeted in their main reception room upon arrival with a champagne cart to greet you with a glass of champagne while they check you into the hotel - Customer service is phenomenal, and everyone was genuinely nice and eager to help with anything you could want or need - Every evening…"
August 2019,Exceptional Experience,Upon check in we were greeted with a variety of Champagnes to choose a glass from.  This set the tone for our entire stay.  Everyone there gave us spectacular service!There was fruit and chocolates in the room.  The cocktails in the afternoon were unique and delicious. The accompanying appetizers were wonderful.  This was the best service we've experienced in over 40 years of traveling!
August 2019,Best hotel experience of my life,"I stayed at Hotel 41 for four nights in August and let me tell you, Hotel 41 has it all. Perfect location, wonderful staff, great food, and the hotel itself has a luxurious vibe that makes you miss it when you’re away. And I’m accustomed to staying at 5 star locales like The Palace in St. Moritz, the Four Seasons, and the Mandarin Oriental.   I usually don’t enjoy hanging out at my hotel but the lobby is so inviting, I found myself hanging out there instead of the local restaurants or pubs. They have tasty free snacks at all hours and after 8 they have dinner (also free). When I stayed they had this delicious chicken curry that I would have gladly paid for. They also had a fantastic breakfast which was included in my stay. You can get a traditional English Breakfast that is…"
August 2019,My second stay even better than the first!,"I was here 5 years ago and wrote  glowing review. Since then it is even better! The staff is still over the top amazing! Everyone knows your name within minutes arrival! Order once and they know your coffee and wine desires and anticipate your needs.  The hotel is beautiful and QUIET! the rooms are the quietest city hotel rooms I have ever experienced. My husband had a back injury and they did everything in their power to make him more comfortable. This is the ONLY place I will ever stay in London. Wow!! For USA travelers, you can book through Costco travel and get tour credits, hotel transfers, a dinner, etc. I think next time I will book straight with the hotel. The tour company is not very good... and Uber is available from LHR now. I would avoid 'Golden Tours' Also location…"
February 2019,Best hotel in london!!,"Visited Hotel 41 in a Junior Suite for two nights in Feb and loved every single part of the stay. The pantry, attention to detail, friendly staff and general atmosphere in the hotel is unrivalled. Can’t wait to stay again!"
August 2019,Wonderful hotel and staff,"The hotel is great. Location right across from Buckingham Palace and the theater.  Underground station right nearby.  The best thing about the hotel for my wife and I was the staff!  Every single one of the staff made it their goal to make our stay the best they could!  We have never stayed in a hotel, and have traveled the world, that had staff accomplish this so successfully. Any return to London, we will be staying there. "
August 2019,Consistently Lovely!,"After many visits, I continue to be impressed by this hotel and its staff! The hotel and my room were beautiful and comfortable, as always. I also appreciate the location and how conveniently located it is to all of the attractions and locations that I love to explore. However, I call this my home away from home while in London because of the staff. They are such a welcoming, professional, and caring group. I truly appreciate being welcomed in such a warm manner during my stay. The staff goes out of their way to accommodate any requests. Maria and the team were very helpful in fulfilling a unique food request that I had and worked to figure out the best option for the food items I needed to carry with me back on my flight for a work event. They truly went above and beyond their…"
August 2019,Wonderful,"No reason to be sceptical about this Trip Advisor recommendation. Hotel 41 is every bit as nice as you would hope. The location isn't even the best part, although who could mind living meters away from The Royals. The Staff is the reason 41 gets its well-deserved rave. From the first greeting at street level, through your final farewell, the personnel know your needs, and anticipate your desires. We had a most delicious slice of chocolate cake, in recognition of our recent anniversary,  awaiting our room arrival, as well as tickets to that night's Proms at The Royal Albert Hall (all pre-arranged by The Hotel.) Our room and bath, away from the bustle below, were extremely comfortable. Our breakfast was first class. Kudos to Magdelena at Reception and Paula for their personalized…"
July 2019,My all-time favorite hotel,"I’d been fortunate enough to stay at Hotel 41 15 years ago on a mother-daughter trip with my 23 year old daughter. I knew if I ever returned to London, I’d be staying at 41. My husband and I visited in early July, 2019 and both loved every minute. The staff become like friends if you choose to spend time with them. We did. We enjoyed breakfasts, afternoon tea, drinks on the rooftop and plundering the pantry and many a fascinating conversation. Although all the staff was terrific, we especially want to mention Stefan, Osi, David and Mitch.  Our room was so comfortable and chic. I did not want to leave. Don’t walk, run to this hotel. "
August 2019,Wow!  This is the place to stay!,"From the moment you walk into Hotel 41 you will be impressed.  The decor, service and accommodations will not disappoint.  With only 28 rooms you feel like you are in your own private club.  This was one of the highlights of my trip."
August 2019,Fabulous experience overall- Staff was amazing and Location was perfect,"From the moment we arrived we were treated  like valued guests. The location is ideal... walking distance to everything we wanted to do and the staff were amazing, gracious and professional. We will definitely return . A special thank you to Stefan- we look forward to seeing you again soon"
April 2019,Impeccable...,"My husband and I just returned from London.  Our stay at Hotel 41 exceeded our expectations.  From the moment we entered this property we realized we were in for something special.  Their impeccable service, attention to detail and their ability to anticipate our every need was absolutely unbelievable.  London is a wonderful city to visit and staying at this exception property only enhanced our visit all the more.  Thank you to the entire staff of 41 for your attention and kindness.  We will see you again!"
April 2019,Top Notch Service ,"Wow, my mother and I just returned from our first stay at 41- it not only exceeded our expectations but it set the bar so high I don’t know how any other hotel can compare. Beyond the aesthetically pleasing interior and rooms, the all day snacks, canapés, treats, and ice cream, & the perfect central location in London, there is the best and most attentive staff working at 41. They not only met our needs but their attention to detail and thinking one step ahead truly sets them apart from the rest! We felt like royalty- the staff knew our preferences (sometimes before we did!), had a unique attention to detail (themed surprises left in our room each day!), and truly cared about our experience and making sure our trip exceeded our expectations! This amazing service started the…"
March 2019,The best hotel I have stayed at,"The reviews for this hotel were fantastic, so I booked 2 rooms for myself and my wife and 2 friends.  The valet parking was a great help as central London is a nightmare, we were taken to the executive bar where the great experience began, from sipping complimentary champagne to canopies and some great toasted sandwiches. The staff were friendly, professional and made you feel as if you were at home. The rooms very clean, the bed was the most comfortable bed I have slept in on all my travels.  It is pricey but it is amazing, even breakfast was stunning. I cannot speak highly enough of the hotel and staff. I now know why it is voted London’s no1 boutique hotel. Location by Buckingham palace is superb,  Highly recommend this for anyone who wants a break or a romantic break, your…"
July 2018,Best Hotel in London,"Phenomenal Hotel.  Great service.  Convenient to Buckingham Palace.  The Concierge was a tremendous help with sightseeing, tickets for plays and transportation needs. I would highly recommend for anyone staying in London. "
March 2019,Wish we had stayed longer!,"This was the nicest, best customer service at a hotel we have ever stayed at. From the soft pillows and linens, steaming hot shower with tremendous water pressure to the fantastic service in the lounge and always having snacks and drinks available, this hotel really impressed us. The concierge always had great recommendations for us and everyone made sure our stay was perfect. Will definitely stay here again next time we are in London!"
March 2019,Best service,"Stayed her for a night with my wife, and i must say the service at Hotel 41 is in its own league. This is our Hotel in London, will definitely stay her when we visit London again. The hotel staff where very friendly and you felt right at home the minute you entered the door."
March 2019,Among My Greatest Hotel Experiences,"Hotel 41 is an exceptional hotel. We spent a week at Hotel 41 and had a wonderful experience. The hotel is full of character, charm, and meticulously maintained. The staff was remarkably attentive. The executive lounge is a wonderful, quiet place for breakfast, afternoon tea, or a peaceful nightcap after a day of exploring the city. Sitting by the in-room fireplace was another great way to unwind at the end of the day. It's in a great area and very walk-able to much of the city. If you choose not to walk, it never took us more than a minute to get a taxi."
March 2019,Practically perfect in every way!,"My daughter and I met in London for a weekend getaway! I had read the previous reviews from tripadvisor and booked the hotel!  The moment we arrived we were greeted by friendly staff that took us to the executive lounge and offered us champagne.  The room was comfortable and done in black and white...the beds are very comfortable!   We loved the Nespresso maker, the heated towel bar in the bathroom and the evening goodies we received at turndown service (homemade candies, lavender spray for our pillows). We enjoyed an afternoon cocktail in the executive lounge and were brought delicious Canapés and croquettes.  They also have a ""pilfer the pantry"" each evening where you can stock up on goodies between 8 pm-1 am (included). The hotel was in a great spot for site seeing and also…"
March 2019,Wonderful weekend,"I have no hesitation in recommending this charming hotel, and endorse the glowing reviews written by others. We could not have wished for a better place to stay for a luxury break in London. A lot of thought has been given to making your stay as comfortable as possible, however, it is the excellent service that makes it such wonderful experience."
January 2019,Update to Simply the Best,"Rarely does a hotel continue to set new standards of defining luxury, yet Mrs. Tollman and her Carnation Group do it!   My previous post ""Still, Simply the Best"" remains accurate.  Mr. Hendry and Ms. Hargrave continue to direct an outstanding team.  The warmth, friendliness, and attention to every minor detail remain the hallmark of the 41.  The staff is extremely well trained and continues to make each stay well above the high expectations I have.  I occasionally lecture to other medical professionals on what ""service"" means, and cite many examples of our experiences there.  lf you are looking for a boutique hotel where cleanliness, luxury, attention to detail, and staff helpfulness offer a quiet respite in busy London, this is the place.   We have referred over 30 friends to…"
October 2018,Amazing hotel!,I can’t say enough wonderful things about our experience at Hotel 41!  The staff in particular from Steven to Dean to Mitchell just made us feel like we were part of the 41 family.   I can say without question the best travel experience my wife and I have ever had.  We plan to visit London again in the next year and the only hotel we will stay at is 41!   Cheers!
October 2018,Outstanding,"What can I say more than it was Great. The standard service is beyond anything I have ever  experienced. I  have stayed in many fine hotels, but this might just be the finest.  The bedding and linen were all top drawer and comfy."
October 2018,Royal Treatment in a Royal Hotel,"The service and attention paid to guests was excellent. I could not have asked for more. Location was great, just a short walk to Buckingham Palace. Lots of other destinations that you could walk to or take a short Uber/cab ride."
September 2018,Amazing place to stay! ,"Most amazing hotel we have ever been! Service is 5 stars, rooms are clean and comfortable, we only stayed for a couple of nights and were quite sad to leave. Food is also excellent!  Worth every penny!"
October 2018,Loved it great stay,I go every year sometimes the cleanliness in the rooms could do with extra attention staff especially the lad with curly hair very attentive always great .the rooms very very clean .i love it pool are great
October 2018,One of the Finest,"From the glass of champagne at check in, hot water bottle in bed, candle lite every evening in the bedroom to the toasties at the executive lounge.... what else could you ask for. The location was perfect, the staff is top notch (Mr. Steve Jones is in his element) and the hotel amenities are far beyond what you would expect.    Our stay at Hotel 41 was top notch and absolutely perfect."
October 2018,Perfect 20the Wedding Anniversary Stay,"Our first trip to London staying at Hotel41 exceeded my already high expectations knowing that it is a 5 star rated hotel.  We stayed in an Executive King room. The room had every amenity you could imagine,  including towel warmers in the bathroom, separate tub and shower stall, desk stocked with every office supply you might need ( I needed a staple remover and stapler).  Nespresso machine and hot pot also in the room.  The quality and efficiency of the service throughout the hotel was of a level I have not experienced ever.  The check-in experience, the sincerity and the warmth of the greetings leaving the hotel for the day or coming back , the efficiency of taking orders for breakfast, after dinner drinks , the clearing of plates is unrivaled.  I asked about adapters for…"
October 2018,Hidden Gem,My wife and I with our 8 yo son and 10 yo daughter stayed at Hotel 41 for four consecutive nights and then a single night when we came back from Paris to fly back to California. We all had a great time. The staff were amazing! The Lounge was a huge highlight of our trip too.  Great food and beautiful place to hang out after dinner. Kids loved Jude’s ice cream at the lounge. The black coconut flavor is amazing. The location of the hotel is perfect too. Half a mile from Hyde Park made it perfect for running and they have a couple of nice gyms within a block of the hotel
October 2018,Incredible,"This was the most incredible, unique experience for us for a hotel stay.  We stayed 5 nights and the staff are amazing.  The room was great (usual London sized), but the experience was fantastic.  I couldn't imagine staying anywhere else in London.  Every hotel we have stayed at and will stay at will probably not compare to this place.  Other hotels need to take a lesson."
October 2018,"First class, amazing all around","From the moment we checked in until we left 5 days later we were thoroughly impressed. The staff was very helpful booking tickets to any activities that interested us, the food from breakfast to dinner being offered right there in the private lounge was top notch and delicious. The maid service was above and beyond with nice little night cap gifts each evening. The rooms were very tastefully done with deep soaking tubs and very comfortable accommodations. The knowledge and service of all the concierge was great, everyone was very eager to assist and very helpful with questions. The fire in the private lounge area was very warm and inviting after a long day of exploring the city. The location of the hotel was perfect, walking to all the parks and attractions as well as the…"
October 2018,Quite literally my favorite hotel in the world!,"As good as the big five star hotels are (Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, Montage, etc.) they can’t even begin to compete with the quality and service of Hotel 41. The experience in the executive lounge is unmatched by any other hotel, whether it’s the extraordinary made to order breakfast menu, afternoon tea, complementary snacks or simply lounging about to read a book, the service is simultaneously unobtrusive and the most attentive I have ever experienced. The subtle and thoughtful touches in the room are beyond compare. Personalized cookies wishing us a good time at the theater; a hot water bottle in our bed when we returned to warm our sheets. Unheard of! If I could choose one hotel to stay at in Europe, this would be the one!"
October 2018,Impeccable service with the Queen as your neighbor.,"Literally right across the street from the Queens residence, the Hotel 41 is a hotel within a hotel, situated on the 5th floor of the Rubens hotel. From the time you enter until the time you check out you cant help but be impressed with the level of service you get from every single hotel employee you meet.  The rooms are a little tight but we did have a king size bed and were able to function fine in the room.  Without even having to go outside you can walk through to the Rubens hotel and have afternoon tea, a great dinner at the English Grill or a drink at one of the bars.   Victoria station and the tube entrance are less than a 5 minute walk. This is a great location for tourists."
October 2018,Service and location second to none!,Before we even arrived on Oct. 29th the staff at the hotel was contacting us to see what they could arrange for us ahead of time. Upon our arrival we were treated like royalty. They gave us champagne and a comfort room to store our luggage and freshen us. Once our rom was ready they upgraded us without our asking. The room was on 2 stories complete with fireplace. The breakfast and afternoon tea were amazing. It is close to some theatres and right next to Buckingham Palace. We will stay here again!
June 2018,God Save the Queen. And 41. ,"My wife and I had the good fortune to stay at this hotel for about a week. The hotel has a great location next to Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station. Essentially, everything in London is within reach. But what makes this hotel special isn’t the location, nor the building itself. It’s the employees, who are clearly well trained in hospitality and have an obvious love for what they do. They are kind, friendly, helpful and always seem to have the answers when the questions are asked. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at 41 and will be back when in London again. "
November 2018,Wonderful Experience ,"We opted to celebrate our 12th anniversary with a weekend stay at Hotel41 and were treated to an upgrade. It was a surprise that was very much appreciated and the split-level suite and its facilities were exceptional. There was a handwritten note, a bowl of fruit and later a small cake to welcome us. Housekeeping made sure the room was always in good condition and there were even lotions and a hot water bottle on my bed during evening turndowns. Certainly most thoughtful as unbeknownst, I was suffering from a sprained back.   Staff took time to cater to our needs and made sure that we were comfortable yet were unobtrusive and afforded us privacy. Questions were always answered and requests were looked into very quickly. There were staff that delivered professional service yet…"
October 2018,Beautiful hotel,"Absolutely fantastic hotel, right across the street from Buckingham Pslave. Extremely good service , top notch!!! The only negative would be that the rooms are very small which is not uncommon in Europe. Every night they left something in your room such as chocolates, rose petals etc. I would also highly recommend the tea and dinner at the English Grille in the Ruben. ( essentially hotel 41 is the 5th floor of the Ruben but you have a separate entrance"
October 2018,Stephen,Wonderful hotel full of fantastic attentive staff. Classic English style and atmosphere makes it extra special -a proper London hotel! Loved the executive lounge and all the snacks available on the house. Loved the fire place and fire on my arrival to my bedroom so cozy and inviting.  Bed was lovely and comfortable and the Breakfast was fantastic. Absolutely no complaints I’ll be back.
October 2018,First Visit ,"Thank you for a wonderful first stay. I enjoyed every second of it. All the staff friendly and I thank them for that. Special thanks go to the reception team for booking and then cancelling the dinner reservation several times, to Stephen for his kindness when the week didn’t go to plan, to the housekeeping staff - I loved the little touches on turndown and all the chefs, kitchen staff, waitresses and waiters the food was superb. I am looking forward to another stay soon. Sue xx"
October 2018,Truly amazing 5* and more,"This was our second visit to hotel 41 as we first visited last year for our 25th anniversary and were so impressed came back for our 26th. This hotel is simply the best, from the moment you step through the door to the moment you leave the service is impeccable and personal. The lounge is a haven to relax in with wonderful food and drinks whenever you want. The rooms are truly Devine, we were lucky enough to be upgraded to the conservatory suite, wow amazing. Im not sure we will ever find a hotel to top 41 and hope we are fortunate enough to be able to return next year."
October 2018,I loved 41 ?,"The hotel was in a great location. We loved the little feeling and attention to guests.  first of all? I am very happy to save money thanks to this magic place: savehotel.ml  the manager, was overdone. She welcomed us and assisted with all our needs. She and her staff really make you feel special. The room was very spacious, clean, large and comfortable.  Will stay again when I am in London."
February 2019,Here We Go Again,"When you walk into a place and the first thing somebody says is, ‘Welcome back Mr and Mrs Gaygan, it’s lovely to see you again’, you know you are somewhere truly special.  I spoken before about how wonderful this place is but I never get bored of writing about it. It wasn’t apprehension about visiting again but I admit to thinking about whether or not it would live up to the previous three visits. Because after all, all good things must come to an end at some point, surely?  As with so many other things, Hotel41 bucks the trend and we felt totally at home even before the lift had taken us to the executive lounge.  The welcome, the room, the food (particularly the croque monsieur), the attention to detail and the care and concern from ALL staff. It was all simply wonderful.  …"
February 2019,Amazing Hotel ,"I booked this hotel as surprise to celebrate our 4th Wedding Anniversary. And based on the reviews plus the hotel being rated no1 I was excited to arrive!  We were not disappointed - we arrived late due to delayed flights but were still given the same 5 star treatment with champagne and excellent attentive staff on arrival.  Our room was lovely and the bed was extremely comfortable - just what you need after a long day/night around a London!   The hotel even surprised us with an Anniversary cake in our room and other little extras to make the trip feel very special!   The complimentary section at the hotel is also a great added extra - canapés, snacks, sweets, ice cream, breads and cheeses - just in case you feel a little peckish.   I can’t say enough about the wonderful staff…"
February 2019,Amazing ♥️,Our second stay and I thought it couldn’t get any better a beautiful hotel with fantastic service and friendly staff who go above and beyond to make your stay pleasurable.I can’t wait to stay again soon
February 2019,Just wonderful ,"What an amazing hotel, from the moment we  arrived to the time we checked out, everything was perfect. Impossible to single out any one member of staff as they are all absolutely top class. We stayed at Hotel 41 for a birthday weekend celebration and the extra little touches were a lovely addition, even arranged a surprise treat at our dinner reservation. Would recommend this place to anyone  Mark and Helen"
February 2019,The best send off!,"My wife and I were emigrating from the UK and I wanted to prepare a surprise for her for our last night. I had never heard of Hotel 41 before but was recommended it by a friend who had stayed there and loved it. My wife has a dairy allergy and the staff prepared a dairy-free chocolate cake which they left in our room with a message (written in chocolate!) wishing us luck with our new adventure. The staff were attentive, friendly and approachable, and would ask us about our upcoming move (which was a very nice touch!) My wife was thrilled with the surprise and we'd definitely stay there again when visiting London. Thank you for such a lovely night!"
February 2019,Valentines Day ,"We had been recommended this hotel by a couple we meet while on holiday, a chance meeting and a small comment”it’s the best hotel in London “ meant that upon our return we looked up “Hotel 41” and I booked for 14th February.  It was absolutely perfect for my husband and I. The staff were engaging and polite and nothing was too much trouble. Our room had everything we needed and anything else we required was only a phone call away.  A few things I feel I have to mention. It is the first hotel that we have been to that the all staff domestic maintenance even the window cleaner were exceptional always putting us first. All staff served with a smile and I genuinely believe that they enjoy working at the hotel. We watched returning customers being welcomed like old friends and staff…"
February 2019,truly exceptionnal,"I strongly recommend this hotel. Very nice place, in the center of London (near Buckingham palace). Exceptional quality of service. Rooms and bed are really great. we really appreciated the bottle of champagne offered in our room and the continuous access to high quality snacking, delicious breakfast, and so and so and so... Looking forward to go there again !"
February 2019,Perfection!,"My husband and I chose Hotel 41 for our stay in London in February of 2019. It's hard to put into words how great this hotel is! The staff is what truly makes the experience one of a kind. It's in a great location that is easily walk-able to Buckingham Palace, Parliament, Big Ben etc. We enjoyed cocktails and canapes by the fire every evening before heading out. Perhaps it was just the jet-lag, but the bed was amazing!"
December 2018,Loved every minute,Thank you so much for making my stay amazing and my Birthday. I saw the show Wicked and when I returned back to my room I had a surprise cake and a signed poster from the Wicked cast. Amazing service and great cocktails!
February 2019,"""Best"" and ""Luxury"" are overused. Need more of ""Exceptional"" and ""Impeccable""","We stayed 5 nights. Upon entering the door the concierge Lenny used our name making us feel we're in the right place. The main room albeit short of space is classic, warm and well appointed. Coming to London as tourists kept us busy. We only ate breakfast here and had a gluten free afternoon tea. The house has just 28 rooms, so everything is quaint and quiet. Just the way I like it.   Guests willing to use $800+ a night know what to expect for service ATDs (attention to details). My wife and I certainly maximised our stay however the list of faux pas service issues are quite long and worth mentioning directly to the GM or GSM.    Housekeeping was perfect.  Professional staff worth mentioning; Victoria, Lenny, Vladislav, William, Mitchell, and Lauren.  Overall I love the brand…"
September 2018,Birthday trip,"This is my second time staying at Hotel 41 and it was wonderful! This visit was with my mom and aunt. My aunt had several special dining and room requests and the staff were incredibly accommodating. We were visiting for my mom's birthday and the hotel had a special piece of birthday cake waiting for her in our room, such a lovely touch. All of the staff are just really top notch, I can't say enough about the support from my initial emails with Adele, to Lauren, Victoria and Gabriel once at the hotel. Thank you for such an amazing visit."
September 2018,Small but miraculous!!!!,"Everything was perfect! Our arrival was warm with a glass of champaign. The Room was very comfortable with enough space for our suitcases and absolutely marvellous! Every detail is special, even the slippers were separated with 'His' & 'Hers' bags! The amenities were wonderfoul and the maids were adding the missing ones. the breakfast also, even though the place is quite small, had almost everything! Everybody makes you feel like a Queen & a King! many thanks!"
September 2018,Luxury hotel!!,"Me and my wife stayed at this hotel for one night,just to try an exclusive hotel during our stay in London  Everything,from the staff,the decor , the detail and the atmosphere generally,was perfect. The breakfast was delicious .The private lounge was beutiful  The room including the bathroom was extremely spacious. Location was perfect with a short walk from Victoria Station. It is a short way if you want to visit the Royal Mews which is located just across the street from the hotel. Buckingham Palace is a just down the street. The drinks in the executive lounge after a day of sightseeing is really relaxing. Absolutely worth a visit"
August 2018,Simply the best,"If you enjoy the chi-chi chic, bling-bling, ostentatious type of 5 star hotel, well, Hotel 41 is not for you. However, if you enjoy unassuming elegance, uncompromising quality, and superior personalised service, then you'll absolutely love this boutique hotel. Located on the 5th floor of the buildlng, you could pass by the discrete entrance of this hotel without noticing it. But as soon as you present yourself at the door, that first impression of extremely attentive service is not just an impression. We were  welcomed with a glass of champagne and small hors d'oeuvres, while we waited just 15 minutes or so as they finished preparing our room, requested for early check-in.. We felt pampered throughout our 7 day stay. Rooms are of a very respectable size, spotlessly clean, and…"
September 2018,Continues to be the best,"We arrived from an overnight flight at 8:a.m., tired and bedraggled, knowing our check in time wasn’t for hours.Although our room wasn’t ready, Hotel 41 brought our luggage to a “courtesy room,” which was one of their standard rooms, where we napped until our booked room was ready. Hotel 41 then upgraded us to a junior suite. The service, as always, was perfect. This is truly a great hotel and I can’t wait to come back."
July 2018,1st visit to London ,"Absolutely loved my 6 days in Hotel 41. The rooms were comfortable, the pillows my favourite!The staff just gave you their utmost service. Nothing was beyond them in trying to please and make our stay memorable. We would love to return to this splendid Hotel. Superb in every way ! "
September 2018,Our Recent Stay,This is a 28 room boutique hotel located on the 5th floor with a small ground floor entry. The service is excellent and what you would expect and desire....best service I have ever experienced while travelling. The rooms are cozy and very comfortable...shower is excellent and set-up as a rain shower and they have a separate bathtub with shower. The bath products are wonderful...Penhaligon's of London....brought these back with us. The hotel is located adjacent to the Royal Mews which is part of Buckingham Palace. There are several Bar/Restaurants as part of a outdoor pavilion to the left of the hotel as you leave if you get hungry or want a drink at night. One tip for this area and London in general...there are several street closures due to construction so give yourself extra…
September 2018,London,"Can I rate more than 5 stars?  Wonderful hotel with wonderful people.  Odd little place, only the 5th floor of Rubens Hotel, but what charm!  Lots packed into a small space.  In London to celebrate birthday and 25th anniversary and I actually felt cherished by the whole staff.  Patrycja's smiling face every morning at breakfast a bonus. One block to Buckingham Palace, one block to Victoria Palace Theatre to see Hamilton. Excellent hotel, excellent trip.  I would return to 41 any time in London."
September 2018,Superb!!!,"Visited with my wife on her birthday and, having held our wedding at another Red Carnation hotel, had high expectations which were more than met by the warm, friendly welcome and marvellous service we experienced throughout our stay.  The room was extremely comfortable and of a good size, well presented and maintained. The champagne on ice, candles and rose petals arrayed when we returned from our evening out was a fabulous touch and made for an even more memorable occasion.  Breakfast was brilliant, and they catered for my wife’s vegan diet superbly well.  You will not be disappointed at Hotel 41!   "
September 2018,The friendliest staff,"The staff truly make a stay at 41 exceptional. They are so friendly and so willing to help. The location of this hotel is perfect, so close to Buckingham Palace. The tube station Victoria is less than a 5 minute walk and allows you to be anywhere fast.  Breakfast is delicious and includes some real British treats.  We thoroughly enjoyed the Afternoon Tea that we booked as an extra.  The snacks available all day and night are also delicious. Our room was perfect."
December 2018,Outstanding as always,"Simply the best hotel in London! It's easy to forget you are even in London as you leave the noise behind and enter the tranquil world of Hotel 41. The ""Whatever, Whenever"" button in the room perhaps gives the best insight into the quality of the service. Breakfast was excellent and the evening canapés, nibbles and small plates menu are incredible, particularly considering they are included in the room rate."
December 2018,Zena,"Just back from another visit to the 41 as always everything was perfect, we were able to watch the fireworks on the rooftop on New Year’s Eve with a glass of champagne, every single member of staff are just wonderful, food excellent bedrooms are fantastic lovely touches from the turndown service hopefully see you again soon "
January 2019,Best ever,I come to this hotel twice a year and it never fails. Service is almost perfect. There are always one or two people at the registration desk who will arrange anything needed. Small (only 28 rooms) but exquisite.
December 2018,Consistently excellent,"Just back from what has become a traditional pre-Christmas stay at 41. The most relaxing yet, as we made sure this time to spend the evening in the Executive Lounge by the fire enjoying sweet and savoury treats from the Pantry, before a great night's sleep and a wonderful breakfast selection the following morning. As ever, we were very well looked after by the entire team who continue to provide an excellent experience for guests.  We look forward to returning in 2019."
December 2018,Perfection,It’s been a few years since our last stay at 41 and I’m pleased to say it’s still as good as ever.  From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave the team make your stay magical.  Upon arrival there is free flowing champagne and they have an open pantry of delicious snacks and soft drinks.  The rooms a very comfortable and well maintained as are the bathrooms.  The location is just behind Buckingham Palace so it’s a short walk to Piccadilly or Kensington.  It’s just lovely and worth every penny.
December 2018,At Christmas Time✨🥂✨,Hotel 41 is simply wonderful. Welcomed with 🥂🔥 and all the delightful team.. A very special place. We made sure we had time for Cheese Toasties this visit😋 Always so happy here!! Thank you ALL of you💕Absolute perfection in absolutely everyway✨XX
December 2018,"Personal, discrete and exceptional luxury","We stayed here for 1 night, in an Executive King Room. Picked a rate excluding breakfast, so we didn't get to try that.  Our stay was fantastic and we would recommend this to anyone.  Highlights:  + Incredible staff with impeccable attention to detail. We were addressed by name by most staff members throughout our 1-night stay. They had also noted the Swedish tradition of advent and made a little arrangement around this in our room.  + Fantastic executive lounge with high-quality nibbles, snacks and food around the clock. There's also a great honesty bar, great seating and a cosy fireplace.  + The ambiance, atmosphere and service is refined and discrete - yet personal and warm. It truly feels like being at home, but with 5-star service around you.  + Welcome drink, where 4…"
December 2018,Exceptional Service and Comfort,"Without a doubt this is one of the best hotels i have stayed in. Being Local to the area i only reserve staying at 5 star hotels abroad but this was a treat and a class above the usual hotels. There is so much character to the hotel and rooms themselves. The breakfast spread was amazing and plenty of options for a vegetarian like myself.  The bathroom was clean, spacious and full of all complementary toiletries.  Warm and cosy beds. Highly recommend  "
November 2018,Simply exceptional,I've stayed in many 5 star luxury hotels...none come close to Hotel 41. This was a truly exceptional experience.  Pros: - they read your mind and seem to know what you want before you even ask. - staff are wonderfully attentive without being intrusive. - excellent rest in a very comfortable bed. - incredible attention to detail both in the room and around the hotel. - stunningly beautiful hotel.  Cons: - none
November 2018,Fabulous from beginning to end,Spent 3 nights here for my 50th Birthday. Suite was amazing and immaculate. Little touches like pillow spray before bed make it extra special. Bed very comfortable. All staff very polite & can't do enough for you. Breakfast delicious. Will definitely return.
July 2018,Am I too old to say OMG!?,"Third visit to Hotel41 and I still get goose bumps thinking about it.   Not sure that there is anything else to say that hasn’t already be said. This place is simply perfect. Yes it is expensive but worth every single penny because of the way you are treated and the attention to detail that is given to every aspect of the visit.  My suggestion is as follows. Stop reading the reviews and just book. Go! Take the significant other in your life, pack a bag and get there.  Thank you Hotel41. For everything. See you for visit number 4 some time in 2019."
July 2018,Sublime,It's hard to know where to begin with this review. With a heavy heart I have just returned back to the 'real world' of my own home and the daily grind of real life and work. The office is looming ominously for me in the morning yet my mind is a million miles away from it: I'm reflecting so fondly over the last 24 hours during my all to brief stay at Hotel 41.   I still smell sweetly of the Penhaligons products supplied. I wanted to take them all home with me but I resisted the temptation. I also wanted to take away the monogrammed soft fluffy towels. And the sheets. And even just one of the pillows from the huge pillow menu. And the robes. And the slippers. And even the unique piped fragrance throughout the hotel (which I believe I'll be able to in a few months time I'm told as…
May 2018,Favorite hotel in London,Great location with an excellent and attentive staff. The rooms are lovely and was delighted by the daily snacks - what a nice surprise. Every detail is carefully thought out. We look forward to our next visit!
July 2018,Simply exquisite ,"This is an exceptional hotel. It has really earned its top ranking on multiple sites. It is   Boutique with only 28 rooms, situated within walking distance of Buckingham palace, Westminster Cathedral and Victoria station. The small extra you pay here compared to other hotels in the area is worth the high level of service and comfort offered.  We were greeted at the door and taken to the executive lounge to check in. Instead of the usual check in desk, we sat down in the lounge where we were offered our choice of champagnes. In the executive lounge there is a selection of complimentary snacks throughout the day. They even offer ice cream. The room was luxurious, clean and comfortable. All food and drinks we had were great.  The attention to detail by all of the staff was…"
June 2018,A wonderful stay at a wonderful hotel!!,"I had seen this hotel in TripAdvisor and had  always wanted to visit!! My mum and I decided to stay as a joint Christmas and birthday present and we were not disappointed!! We were greeted at the door and waited for someone to show us up to the fifth floor where the main of the hotel is located. When we arrived on the correct floor we were taken to the Executive Lounge to check in. We were welcomed with a lovely glass of champagne whilst we filled out the details needed which was a lovely way to begin our stay!! Following this we were shown to our room which was delightful!! I love the black and white theme that runs through the hotel and the room was perfect!! Not large, but perfect for what we wanted!! Lovely comfortable twin beds, writing desk, sofa and tv area and a…"
July 2018,Exceptional everything during our third stay at Hotel 41,"I cannot fathom coming to London and staying anywhere else. Hotel 41 is beautiful, the food and cocktails incredibly delicious and the delightful staff helped with all our bookings and coordinated drivers for our party of four. I had a snafu in which tickets had to be picked up and there was no way for us to physically make it by before the event. Hotel 41 arranged for someone to pick them up. We were introduced to what is now our favorite new gin cocktail, made with Gin Mare, a rosemary sprig and two Spanish olives by Steve. Another gentleman on staff, Steph, recommended a straight razor shave and place to get one for the guys that they thoroughly enjoyed. I will be back as soon as I can! Thanks for all Hotel 41!!!"
July 2018,Out of this world!,"From arrival to leaving we have never felt so well looked after nor spoilt in any hotel.  Upon arrival we were greeted by a really friendly young man in the lobby, who seemed genuinely interested in making us feel comfortable and relaxed. The lobby has snacks and drinks that are there to refresh you on arrival and departure. We were then taken up to the 5th floor lounge to check in. Stefan brought over a selection of champagned and made a great recommendation for me to try (as I have no clue nor a distinguished palette).  We were a little early so we were offered some canapes (cheese straws, egg dip and olives) with our drinks whilst we relaxed in the lounge.  The lounge has a mini freezer with around 12 different flavours of Jude's ice cream that you can help yourself to…"
July 2018,Wow,"Brilliant from the minute you step through the door. Very welcoming staff (glass of champagne, anyone?) and the hotel itself is beautifully quirky. We didn’t make the most of the (free) ice-cream bar so that’s my excuse to go back."
June 2018,Just Wonderful,"An Unforgettable experience, Never felt like a hotel ,more like an exclusive club. Staff went beyond expectations and made our 2 day stay even more pleasant. I would highly recommend this hotel to all "
July 2018,Prepare to be Pampered,"The Hotel 41 is one of the finest hotels I have stayed in. The staff is universally excellent--friendly and helpful. From the welcome in the lobby to registration on the fifth floor, to the staff in the lounge, everyone was so pleasant and knowledgeable.  Stefan in the lounge offered us great advice in local museums and history and the lounge setting itself is very special. Sort of like having your own English club, with tasty dishes, snacks and drinks throughout the day and night.  Breakfast service as also outstanding with a wide variety of breakfast items for all tastes.  The hotel rooms are extremely well appointed, including virtually everything one needs for a restful stay. The rooms are quite spacious by London hotel standards and all very quiet, since they are on the…"
August 2018,Enchanting hideaway in the centre of London,"This was my second visit, and if at all possible this place is better than on my previous visit.  It’s a bolt hole, private, and the service is impeccable.   No traffic noise, well appointed rooms and enormously comfortable.  I can only say that we will return again and again.  You will see from other reviews that I am someone who travels the world frequently, and I do have my favourite hotels in different capital cities.  This is the one for London."
August 2018,The best of the best in London,"My second stay at this hideaway in the centre of London.  It is a superb hidden gem in the centre of a busy city.  The quality of this place is unbeatable, and the service and help for guests is like no other in the world.  We will return as we thoroughly enjoyed our short stay."
August 2018,Excellent hotel,"41 made us feel like royalty for a week! Everything was taken care of for us, the staff is so attentive and kind, they also give great recommendations for tour companies and food. The location of the hotel is great as well. I really appreciate how the staff went above and beyond. Thank you all again!"
August 2018,A very good option.,"We have recently enjoyed a three night stay in a split level suite which was a pleasant experience. All staff were helpfull and attentive, all our needs were met and without doubt this hotel does deserve it's ranking amongst the higher echelons of London hotels. Breakfast is a quiet and relaxed affair and the lounge is comfortable.  Our room was a reasonable size with all you would expect for the price paid. The location is excellent, walking is a pleasure and all you need is close at hand.  A big shout out to all the staff we encountered and a big thank you.  This hotel is ran like a Special Forces Unit, 99.9% need not apply!"
December 2017,Outrageously Good,"Well, what can I say. I was left spellbound by their service and the comfort and amenities.  The location is absolutely amazing.  If you have the money, go for it. You won't regret it. Even at this price, this gives you the highest bang for the buck in such a central location of London."
July 2018,The Hotel that keeps on delivering a 5-star experience…,"I’ve left my fair share of reviews every time we come back to 41Hotel, for a very good reason!   This Hotel is and absolutely deserves to be number 1!   The service, personalised experience, familiar faces, staff and location all make for this hotel being one easy way to get comfortable when travelling back to London and almost has a way of making you feel ... like you never left or that you're part of the family!   Another exceptional stay which has a lot to do with the staff.  Thank you again!"
August 2018,Nice find,Travelling its fun and sometimes tiring I'm so glad I stayed here. Very clean and great service. Worth every penny. Highly recommend to you all travellers or even if you visiting this place is just amazing find. See u next time :). Thank you
July 2018,Luxury at its finest!,"I found Hotel 41, here on trip advisor. My husband and I came to London as a part of our 20th wedding anniversary. I cannot express enough about this hotel! The staff put effort in every detail. We arrived and checked in early from a red eye flight. The staff took our luggage and guided us to the executive lounge to complete check in. First, we were offered a delicious complimentary glass of champagne. Our room wasn’t quite ready, which we expected. We stayed in the executive lounge and were presented with snacks and comfort while we waited (no more than 15 minutes). After arriving to the room, In which Adele assisted us to; along with giving us information and plenty of advice of things to do, we slowly took in the details of this beautiful room in 01. Very beautiful and clean.…"
July 2018,Hotel 41 Meets The Royal Standard of Excellence,"My stay at 41 more than exceeded my expectations. From cheerful manners, attentive service, exceptional surroundings, practical help, delicious food and fine conversation, the entire staff enriched my trip to London in every possible way. I was treated like a highly honored guest.  "
October 2017,Best of the best,"Perfect location, one of the best hotels I have ever been to . The staff is friendly, good looking and well trained! We had maybe the best Beef Wellington we ever tried and despite the high rates we will definetely return back here! Cheers to John, Liza and Pawel for everything!"
September 2018,Right at home! ,The hotel is amazing but what made this stay so special was the wonderful staff!  They were helpful with anything I needed from arranging a car for the airport to the attention and personal service at breakfast.  The rooms are beautifully decorated and the bed is so comfortable! Every amenity you could possibly need is available and this is a great location right by Buckingham Palace. Being a small boutique hotel has its advantages with such personal service.  Bravo Hotel 41!  Looking forward to another visit in the future!  
September 2018,Excellent staff responsiveness,"Our stay at Hotel 41 was our best hotel experience in 40 years. The staff was excellent and everyone was very responsive to any questions and requests. After a couple days, they were aware of our dietary restrictions and made sure they were reflected in the excellent breakfasts and snacks throughout the day. The hotel is very centrally located near Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station."
October 2018,One of the very best hotels I have ever visited! ,"My daughter (aged 14) and me stayed at the hotel for one night. What a pleasure! The hotel is luxury, and the staff are just very very nice, and make you feel special and wellcome. Pure luxury, at the same time a relaxed and friendly athmosphere.   The breakfast/ lounge/ restaurant room is just like an old fashioned adventure. We had a drink there after the restaurant, and the staff made a very nice alchohol-free drink for my daughter (and the very best Margarita for me).  The stay was completed with a very nice breakfast.   We will be back 41! You are a hidden pearl, I hope many people with find you.   The hotel is very close to Buckingham Palace. We had a nice walk passing by the castle through Green Park and then you are in the middle of everything.  Victoria station is also…"
October 2018,Stunning and elegant!,"We absolutely loved this hotel. The location couldn't be better; an oasis of quiet and calm but steps away from the nightlife and Victoria Station (as well as the underground).  The staff thought of everything! We particularly enjoyed evening drinks which always included canapés and ""toasties"". We discovered the ice cream fridge early on and together managed to sample six out of a possible ten varieties. We're coming back soon to try the rest!"
August 2018,Fantastic place to stay.,"What makes this place special is not the fantastic location, nor the great room, not the spectacular service. It is the staff. Friendly, helpful, and just all around nice. We had a fantastic stay, walking distance to all kinds of places, but the people really helped make the experience one of the best I have ever had traveling. Thank you."
September 2018,Perfection!,"Outstanding experience.  Great facilities, but staff made the experience.  Every single person I met was professional, cordial, and went out of their way to make me feel at home and make my holiday a success."
September 2018,1st Class with some more!,"We had a fantastic time, the hotel, staff, bedrooms, exec lounge, food and ""plunder in the pantry"" were all 'simply the best'. The 3 days were not long enough, anyone visiting this hotel need to consider spending more time at the Hotel, breakfast was great, dinner at the Rubens 1st class but evenings in the Exec Lounge was brilliant."
September 2018,Gem of a hotel,"We stayed here to celebrate my husband's 50th Birthday.  From the minute we arrived, we were made to feel special and welcome.  The staff were all amazing; they were always on hand to help and advise but not in an overpowering way.  This is just the most wonderful hotel and we will definitely come back for our next big celebration."
September 2018,Wow ,"Fantastic place, fantastic staff and fantastic atmosphere! Felt so comfortable and relaxed and like I didn’t want to go home after my visit, I would recommend to friends and family and will definitely revisit this hotel. "
September 2018,Fabulous Beautiful Hotel!,"Hotel 41 is simply wonderful!  It is extremely lovely and every aspect is special!  The location is excellent and centralized for getting around in the city of London.  The lounge for meals was so beautiful and very comfortable, and the food was very well done for breakfast each morning. We loved it!  Our room was great and was maintained perfectly every day.   One of the most special aspects about the hotel is the absolutely wonderful staff!  Each and every one of them made us feel very welcomed and important and were exceptionally helpful.  I have no doubt that when we return to London, we will be staying at Hotel 41 again!"
July 2018,Five star experience ,"The room was very comfortable, with every amenity. Staff were very attentive. There is a lounge where snacks, ice cream, and fruit are complimentary and available from morning to night.  The staff very kindly allowed my visiting family to use the lounge for an afternoon.  Couldn’t be better."
July 2018,There is simply no place better,"This boutique hotel is simply incredible.  I cannot list enough superlatives to describe its rooms, comfort, food and most of all the hospitality and staff.  From the minute you check in the staff makes you feel special and they truly want you to have a wonderful stay.  They helped us set up tours, rides, reservations for dinners and transportation to and from the airport..  In the Executive Lounge daily pantry snacks, drinks and even free dinner dishes are served lounge And is free.  Alex, Jonnais, and Jean Nicholas were just incredible to us during our stay.  The turn down service at night is just wonderful and you really feel special after a dinner or night activity with snacks, gifts and candles.  All the personalized service and touches make this place very special.  It was…"
July 2018,Sometimes perfection comes in the form of responding to challenges,"Let me start out by saying they people at Hotel 41 are top notch.  They will do whatever it takes to make your stay better and help you enjoy your time at the hotel and London.  Marlen was especially helpful in putting together a surprise for my wife upon arrival.  I had purchased Wimbledon tickets and wanted to surprise my wife.  Marlen procured a piece of astro-turf, tennis ball, strawberries and cream, Lanson Champagne and a card from my dictation and set it all up for us in the room.  It was perfect.  That perfection continued, but in a different way.  Our first night we didn't sleep too well.  I felt the room was noisy and the AC (thank goodness for it during a heatwave) was blowing directly on the bed.  I brought it to the staff's attention, and they sprung into action. …"
July 2018,"Whatever, Whenever","There is no place like 41.  We have been fortunate to stay several times in the last few years, including an 8 day 'friends and family' visit in 2016 during which we treated as such; friends and family.   41 is ideally located for those who like to explore on foot.  The hotel is across the street from the Royal Mews / Buckingham Palace. It is an easy 10 minute stroll to the Birdcage Walk and both St. James Park and Green Park are within 15 minutes as is Westminster Abbey.  Recently Nova Food has emerged across the street with a multitude of food and drink options which are handy as well if you are lucky enough to have theatre tickets for Hamilton; something we were able to secure through the hotel on our most recent visit.  41 is about service. We have established great…"
December 2017,Pure Luxury,"I got engaged in Hotel 41 so it definitely holds a special place in my heart anyway, but I don't think you could describe the hotel as anything other than pure luxury.  The rooms are super spacious given the location. All the staff go above and beyond and nothing is too big or small an issue for them to help with. I know Florent helped my now fiancé out a lot when planning the engagement surprise.   The little touches such as your glass of champagne on arrival, the ice cream available in the executive lounge and hot chocolate when headed out really added to our stay. The hotel is so grand and luxurious, in such a great location in London and just went above and beyond for us - I really hope we make it back in the near future to stay again. I would happily recommend this hotel to…"
June 2018,Impeccable hotel,"An absolute gem! Lovely atmosphere and amazing staff. Open pantry gives an extra value, especially when you travel alone, not too keen to spend every night eating out. Hotel location is super, close to parks, tourist attractions and public transportations.  Highly recommended! /Emilie A"
June 2018,Wonderful experience!,Large comfortable room with all of the amenities you would expect.  The huge difference is the staff who competently and quickly responded to our questions and needs.  They were so welcoming--yet professional--that we felt like we were staying with friends.  All of their suggestions were perfect for our needs.  Delicious treats with cocktails.  A freezer full of ice cream for your snacking any time.  The morning breakfasts were excellent.   Everything was great--and we will recommend the hotel to everyone.  Thanks.
July 2018,Amazing Discrete Hotel,We stayed a Saturday night and were very impressed.  Quite a discrete entrance as this hotel doesn’t shout like most properties for this luxury do.  The staff were fantastic and very helpful.  The interior is great and the rooms well furnished. 
July 2018,Fabulous Service,This warm and welcoming hotel was a dream! The staff are polite and extremely professional. Endless delightful food items are offered throughout the day complimentary to guests. The rooms are clean and the bed is comfortable. Fabulous stay!
July 2018,Outstanding attention to detail and customer comfort,There is a good reason 41 is so highly rated by its visiting customers. It is their outstanding attention to customer care and comfort. The room assigned though not terribly spacious had every comfort feature you could possibly want. The bed was particularly comfortable with a perfectly balanced duvet. Of the right weight too. The highly branded 41 property will leave you wondering what else could they have done for you to remember 41. It's not all the 41 logos that you see on everything but the human interaction of the amazing staff. Including the highly experience South African F&B manager whose recommendations one should listen to. He will charm you to dizzying heights. That is what you will remember best from 41. The rest can be chaulked as world class creature comforts but…
April 2018,Great hotel!,"The service here is impeccable, although a little too personal for my taste. The breakfast was fresh and flawless, we never had a better breakfast in our lives! The rooms were great, the beds were very comfortable. The rooms were a litlle small and a bit chilly (heating was not working). Toilets were not flushing properly. But all in all a great stay."
November 2017,"Best hotel service, ever.","Physically, this hotel is an ordinary, somewhat dated, small luxury hotel. But the service is absolutely incredible. Better than the best in the world (Connaught/Claridge's/etc.).. Just one tiny example: during turndown service, they carefully tidied the dangling cords on my phone chargers with little Velcro cable wraps. Who DOES that? Just stellar."
June 2017,Fun Hotel in the London Area,"I traveled to London and stayed at the Hotel 41 during the summer time, it was beautiful and filled with amazing character.  The most incredible think about the hotel is it's historical charm and attention to detail."
April 2018,"Service, Service, Service","This is an incredibly nice hotel so you expect the room to be comfortable and clean, you expect a decent lounge, newspapers, coffee, tea, etc. I read about the service in other reviews, but until we stayed here it was hard to understand what a difference that can make on an international trip.  For someone who is used to taking care of everything this was actually a little difficult to get used to, for the first hour...... we asked about getting tickets to the Churchill War Room, sure they will be down in the lobby in a few minutes.  Great, that was easy, we walked up to the area and saw a very long line, no worries, we showed the paperwork to the gentleman directing people and he escorted us to the front of the line and let us in right away, wow didn’t expect that!! Dinner…"
March 2018,Whatever/Whenever,"Whatever/Whenever is more than just a label on the top button of the 41's room phones.  It is a philosophy that permeates their service culture.  I could write volumes on their impeccable attention to detail, their almost clairvoyant anticipation of your needs, and that mesmerizing aroma that perfumes the halls of the 41 with a woodsy cleanliness that's difficult to put in words.  Instead I'll share my experience where once again action speaks louder than words.  On a recent trip to London, my wife realized she had forgotten to pack our portable steam iron--an indispensable item for our upcoming cruise.  I pressed the W/W button to see if I could get some help finding a place where I could purchase one in London before our cruise the next day.  Meanwhile we went sightseeing…"
April 2018,Simply the Best,"In the words of Tina Turner, whose World Premiere Musical, ‘Tina,’  we were lucky enough to see in London....Hotel 41 is ‘Simply the Best’. The level of concierge service is above & beyond all expectations. It is rare that I remember the names of Hotel management but from Victoria & Nicole who I initially made contact with to Max & especially David,....I grew fond of them all. David was funny, completely authentic, knew lots about London, traveling & being adventurous. Before booking I thought the hotel might be a bit too formal for my taste but all involved Hotel 41 are very down to earth. They seemed genuinely interested in us as artists & made suggestions based on that.  The ‘ Executive Lounge’ is on the same floor (level 5) as the rooms. Both Hotel 41 and the Lounge have a…"
May 2017,One of the very best in the world,"Having stayed at various top-end hotels and read the raving reviews, my expectations were very high. And they were exceeded with grace and without hesitation. This is a very special place where it's all about the guest. I've come back several times and the staff never failed to deliver against the standards they set the first time. Don't tell anyone about this place so it can stay one of the best-kept secrets of London."
April 2018,Excellent Hotel for a Stay in London,"I would have to say this is one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed at.  The level of service provided by the staff is top notch and the facilities, food and level of customer care is unrivalled.  If you want to treat yourself book and stay here.  As an added benefit, the location in London is excellent for access to Victoria station and most of the attractions the City has to offer."
April 2018,A dream. ,"I’ve stayed in many a London hotel and I have to say that Hotel 41 is my favourite. Although pricey, you definitely get what you pay for and I had an amazing weekend alone, from the kids here. May make a habit of it! "
November 2017,World class service,We travel a lot & this hotel has never failed to impress us with its outstanding service.  Sharing a recent experience- The staff were exceptionally courteous & helpful. Even the smallest requirements of each & every guests were taken care of which is really commendable.  I strongly recommend this hotel.
February 2018,"Excellent Hotel, Upscale and Mature","My wife and I stayed here for two nights in February and it was one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed in.  The hotel centers around an Executive Lounge and the activities, including checking in, breakfast and the entire food service center around this lounge.  The rooms have the best amenities and are a good size for a city like London.  Service is what you would expect from a hotel like this one.  Everyone we came in contact with was very helpful.  The free food in Executive Lounge is a nice treat, particularly after seeing a show."
March 2018,Quite simply the best,"My husband and I stayed here one night prior to flying out from Gatwick to the Maldives and again on the return leg of our journey from North Yorkshire. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. From the moment you enter the hotel you are in the hands of the most efficient, friendly, and professional  hotel staff I have ever encountered.  On the outbound journey we stayed in an executive room which was excellent and on our inbound journey we were upgraded to a junior suite. It was unexpected but what a treat. This room on a split level was absolutely fantastic.  Regarding food, we had breakfast on both occasions and were both very pleased with our full English and eggs benedict respectively. We also had a chance to ‘plunder the pantry’ in the lounge. It was excellent in the…"
February 2018,What a Find!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at 41 in every aspect.  From the minute we walked through the entrance and were welcomed with warmth and respect to the time we sadly had to leave, this hotel and its staff impressed us with professionalism and forethought.  Although the spaces (entrance, passages, rooms, bathrooms) are not large, the superb black and white decor makes up for it with attention to detail and interest.  The convivial business lounge, which is the hub of the establishment and which is operative from early morning until late every night, has been cleverly laid out into private seating areas suitable for breakfast, teas, snacks, drinks, late night foraging or just reading the newspaper.  Such a clever concept.  Here you can help yourself to drinks and an array of…"
March 2018,Ladies and Gentlemen serving Ladies and Gentlemen!,"Myself and my wife have stayed here a few times and without exception it is the best hotel to stay in whilst in London. A real unique home from home experience, put simply we love it!  All staff are exceptional, a special mention to Steve and Dean for the way they looked after us.  We will return soon I am sure."
February 2018,Fantastic Holiday,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying here on a recent trip to London. We could not recommend the hotel more. The location was fanatic and the staff, sublime. We were warmly welcomed and shown to our room, despite arriving at 9:00 am. The restaurant recommendations from the staff surpassed our expectations. We hope to return on future trips."
February 2018,Returning Home,"This is my daughter and my fourth stay at the Hotel 41 and will certainly not be our last. Based on our experience, we can honestly say that the consistently amazing customer service at the Hotel 41 doesn't happen by accident. It happens on purpose! The Hotel 41 staff goes to great lengths to make sure you feel like invited guests to a party and they are the hosts. From the front desk staff to the wait staff to the housekeeping staff...an experience is created that's worth talking about to other travelers and not easily forgotten. I certainly will not forget the congratulatory card for my daughter's engagement, or the thoughtful tokens left by Lukas to make my trip to Kensington Palace all the more special, or the tea tray sent to my room with a lovely note from Mitchell after a…"
March 2018,Exceptional boutique hotel,We stayed here for 2 nights and highly enjoyed every detail. From check in to check out the staff were excellent and treated us like royalty. The hotel is small and expensive but worth it for very special occasions.  The decor and style is very luxurious and the rooms are amazing. Food is delicious and staff are amazing. We will be back and recommend highly for others to stay here. 
February 2018,Birthday bliss,"My husband and I stayed here for my birthday after having had it recommended to us by a friend..  From the very 1st welcome, to the helpfulness with taxis and directions to the swift easy checkout nothing was too much trouble for any member of the staff.   we were made to feel that nothing was too much trouble ..  And the little extra touches the hotel provided were what makes this hotel  a cut above some others. Our room,the food and the service were all amazing and we wouldn’t hesitate to return."
March 2018,Customer service defined!,"From the very moment that you enter, the staff is completed dedicated to your experience. The rooms are tastefully done with little extras like chocolates and lavender spray at turndown service. Fruit is always present in your room. This is strictly boutique! You could walk right past it if you didn't know what you were looking for. Thank you Victoria for helping us with our luggage situation!!! She was making calls for us 8 hours after we had checked out!"
February 2018,What a find-sublime,"Tucked away and barely noticeable next to Reuben's hotel is the 41 Hotel in Buckingham Palace road, number 41. A delightful boutique hotel  of 28 rooms and part of the red carnation group that has hotels like the Oyster box in Umhalanga rocks South Africa and the 7 Apostles hotel in Capetown-top of the range 5 star hotels -as is the 41. The attention to detail is brilliant, from a glass of champers when you check in  in the lounge, to the handwritten note from the hotels manager welcoming you. The rooms are not huge but well appointed with great amenities. The bed is divine and one could just sleep an entire vacation away . The decor is warm, black and white tiles, wood, black and white warm upholstery , thick curtains that do block out the light  and little goodies that just…"
April 2018,Not as nice,We are sad that we stayed in this hotel as the last hotel on our trip to England and France because we will not remember it as nicely as the hotels that we stayed in. The biggest thing is for us is that the people the hotel is employing are not like in the other hotels. On our journey at this hotel we did not feel as though people wanted to take care of us in the same way and that we make problems for them by being in the hotel. The staffs were not always present and attentive to what you needs and that made it difficult. It did not feel as professional a hotel and I think we had expected more form a English luxury hotel in London.
December 2017,Excellent stay on Christmas Eve,I had an excellent stay here this past Christmas Eve.  It was my second time at the hotel and it was just as good as I had remembered.  The staff even left stockings filled with nice little items on all the doors for guests to discover on Christmas.  I definitely plan to stay here again the next time I am in London.
March 2018,"Great staff, great location","This hotel is unusual in many ways. For one, it consists of one single floor, accessed from a street-level elevator, from a separate door next to the entrance to The Rubens. The hotel’s interior is quiet, despite its location near Buckingham Palace. But keep the windows closed to keep out the traffic noise!  The room-temperature controls are very good.   The location is excellent, a short walk from Harrod’s, Hyde Park, and Westminster Abbey. The street is not as busy as it is in Mayfair, near the Dorchester or Claridges. Plenty of taxis pass by. Our split-level “suite” had a big bed, skylights, and a big bathroom.   The staff were consistently polite and helpful. Our special thanks to Mr. Jones and to Greg and Armand in the Executive lounge, and to David for his cheerful…"
April 2018,Outsanding boutique hotel -- one of the best!,"This is the best city hotel we have ever stayed in, through many years of travel. We love the boutique size and the extraordinary personalized attention. The concept of the executive lounge is so appealing that we are surprised it's not a model found in other fine boutique hotels. We spent much time in the lounge, savoring the tasty food and drinks, and always felt welcomed and comfortable. The staff went out of their way to accommodate our every need and to anticipate ones we didn't even know we had. The location is excellent, and it's easy to get anywhere in London from the hotel. It is pricey but worth every penny. We can't wait to return."
April 2018,Great ’private club -like’ 5 star boutigue hotel,"Amazing service. Feels like a private club with attention to smallest details. Simply great, especially if you look for something more personal & different than big hotels chains. Breakfast was awesome and served until 11, thus you can make it almost like an early lunch. "
February 2018,Wedding anniversary stay,We had a lovely stay here for our wedding anniversary. As it was a special occasion they upgraded our room and surprised us with a cake. The level of customer service is excellent and the rooms very tastefully furnished. The refreshments on offer in the lounge area are very good quality and it was a very nice place to chill out after a busy day in London.
April 2018,50th Birthday Celebrations in the Conservatory Suite,"I originally booked Hotel 41 nearly 10 months before my 50th Birthday purely on recommendation of Tripadvisor (being No 1 in London) and I was not disappointed in the least.  After my booking I did ""pop"" in to check the layout of the Conservatory Suite as I was going to use it as not only for accommodation but as a base for several ""drink parties"" during my stay (3 days).  The Conservatory Suite is split on two levels with downstairs seating for at least (4/5 if you include the stairs) and on the upper level seating for at least 7/8. I was pleasantly surprised I was able to bring my own bottles of wine/drinks with me and they even suggested emptying the mini bar prior to my arrival to accommodate!   I had pre-ordered Afternoon Tea for Sunday in the Board Room for 8 (offered free…"
April 2018,Home away from home,"Where to begin? Our family of four recently spent 7 nights in Hotel 41. From the moment we entered the hotel to the moment we left, we were treated like family. The personalized service was like nothing we had ever experienced. Within a day, the entire staff knew all of ours names and were constantly ahead of each planned moment of our trip. Some might find this overkill, but we found this level of concierge service to be extremely helpful to us as we navigated the city of London as well several countryside towns. Train tickets, restaurant suggestions, reservations, taxi service, snacks and lunches for longer  day trips...always with a warm smile. Anytime we were away from Hotel 41 for the day and trying to figure out how to manage our evening, we always found ourselves saying,…"
April 2018,Exquisite Hotel,"It seems that we are in good company as fans of The 41. Everything about this jewel box of a boutique hotel was perfect. Others have described the comfortable rooms, thick towels on hot towel racks (also excellent for drying hand laundry), delicious snacks, and beautiful spaces. The old board room AKA the Lounge is so classically British that we smiled each time we entered. The management clearly knows that their most important asset is the staff, and they are wonderful. Thank you."
June 2017,Truly the ultimate example of British class and service,"My wife and I have stayed here a few times, and it is always exquisite. We will be staying there again in 4 weeks. The last time we stayed we were rushing into the UK on business. We arrived late-morning as usual, exhausted and travel-burnt. We had to be smart and back on top by dinner. The hotel coordinated our ride in, as usual they had precisely the pillows, bedding and flowers we like in the room and best of all coordinated 2 masseuses for a couples-massage just after we arrived. I can't overstate how much we enjoy the people that work there, the way they take care of customers or the class with which they behave. Our upcoming trip will be our first all-pleasure stay, as we break journey for a few days before continuing east. I can honestly say that staying there, regardless…"
March 2018,Heaven on Earth,"I didn't want to leave. This place is great: location, attentive staff, relaxing lounge, beautiful room with deep soaking tub, and champagne offered upon arrival. You must stay here at least once in your life to treat yourself. One word: awesome."
March 2018,Truly luxurious hotel,"Over the last few years we have stayed on 3 occasions and each time found the hotel to live up to the high standards we have learnt to expect. The hotel itself is extremely comfortable and well appointed and maintained, but the excellent staff make the experience a real treat. They are very attentive but remain relaxed and put us at ease."
July 2017,Late entry but truly 5 star service and accommodation!,"This review is late, but better late than never! We stayed one year ago at Hotel 41, July 3-5, 2017. I had originally booked a different property, but with the terrorist attack one month earlier, approximately, at that time, I moved hotels to what I considered to be a safer venue. We booked 2 rooms, one for my husband and I, the second for our teenage kids. The hotel is about 2 blocks from Buckingham Palace :)  When we arrived, we were greeted by name. We were escorted to the lounge area and the set up was explained. We also were offered our choice of one of 3 different champagnes to choose from! Fantastic start! We checked into our rooms then went out enjoy the sights. One of the staff told us Kings Cross station had an actual Harry Potter store and also had platform 9 3/4 and…"
March 2018,Exceptional,"The whole experience from the moment you enter the building is exceptional. The care, attention to detail and personalised service is delivered by their many members of staff in such an unobtrusive, genuine fashion that you feel comfortable and valued with every interaction - they make it seem so easy!  Our stay at Hotel 41 has become the benchmark by which we will now judge any future luxury hotel experience. Outstanding."
November 2017,Nice,"Enjoyed a weekend away, clean and all staff was friendly. Would definitely go again and recommend. Location is also very good, enjoyed our breakfast for the price it’s what I expected thank you for great service"
March 2018,Fabulous!!!,"Hotel 41 is truly a five star hotel, it  deserves it's accolade of the best hotel in the UK. The service is impeccable but not obtrusive, all requests are dealt with efficiently and with a smile! I found the extra touches and the attention to detail throughout amazing, it made my two night stay absolutely perfect.....................I can't remember when I last had a hot water bottle tucked in my bed, but it was oh so welcoming!  Thank you for a memorable stay and I hope to return very soon."
March 2018,Exceeded its lofty expectations,"Hotel 41 delivers on its promise! From the moment we checked in, we knew we made the right decision. Every single aspect of our stay was perfect! The location can't be beat, and the staff went above and beyond to ensure that everything was perfect at all times.   The centerpiece is of course the living room - which was always well-stocked with snacks, and had an fantastic bar menu. The breakfast selection was fantastic, and food was prepared to order with our preferences in mind.   The room is a bit on the small side, so we only did breakfast in our room the first day. Other than that, it was a perfect and cozy room, and the shower had epic water pressure which is always a welcome perk!   I can't wait to tell my friends and family about Hotel 41, and hope they stay there soon so…"
February 2018,Amazing but we had a noisy room...,From the beginning to the end perfect. Such a beautiful and special place to stay! Etremely friendly staff. Love the fireplace in the rooms.  Only one thing: by email we asked some days before arrival for the most quit rooms as I am a very light sleeper. They confirmed that they would make sure we would get a quit room and I was so happy.  Unfortunatelly we were situated beneath the special masterroom upstairs and the person who stayed there obviously was jetlagged or whatever. The up and on walking on an old wooden floor made such a sound that I was awake almost the whole night... The day after we moved to other rooms and they were perfect. However one of the staff members told me that he had his doubts before putting us in our previous room and thought that our second room is…
March 2018,*Almost* perfect service...,"We stayed in the conservatory suite for a couple of nights and our overall experience was excellent. For such a small hotel I can just imagine how difficult it would be to hire and maintain such a well trained staff that truly understands and provide luxury service. There were a couple of teeny service quibbles (including one bigger one our departure) that I will detail later. They will seem very minor but at well over a grand a night, things need to be 100 percent. For these issues I scrooged and only gave 4 out of 5 rating (I wish TA would allow half stars so i could give 4.5). We pulled up in a rental car. The hotel sits on a very busy road (Buck Palace Rd) that is ""redlined"" which means absolutely no stopping (unless you're a bus or taxi)...and there is nowhere at all to…"
March 2018,Excellent hotel,"Stayed at Hotel 41 for one night during business trip. Impeccable service, personal attention, classy surroundings, clean and well equipped room;- all  facilitated to make the stay comfortable and memorable. Probably one of the best hotels in London. "
February 2018,Valentine Treat,"Having booked a surprise valentine trip for my wife, Hotel 41 made the experience all the more special. From the moment we walked into the foyer of the hotel, we were greeted by excellent and extremely helpful staff. Nothing was too much trouble throughout our stay and the romantic turndown service a lovely treat. We were recommended to this hotel by a friend, and we will certainly be recommending it.  Regards Hugh C"
February 2018,a very pleasant stay,"We stayed in the Hotel 41 from monday through thursday. It is a very comfortable place, where the staff tries to read your wishes from your eyes. We would always choose it again for a trip to London. The services include even the offer of complementary water when leaving the hotel for the day."
February 2018,Amazing Location and and even better Guest Services,"Absolutely impecable service, together with a great location. Prepare to be spoiled by wonderful staff that is ready to assist you in anything you might need. Naturally, this kind of service comes with proper pricing."
February 2018,41 London,Amazing hotel with the most amazing staff and service. Cozy rooms with lots of space. You feel special when you live there. It’s quiet but still there is a great vibe there. The lounge is absolutely perfect and cozy and the food is great- already looking forward to come back and say hello again to the wonderful staff that will take care of you 24/7. See you soon :)
February 2018,A Classic London atmosphere ,"This is not one of the typical hotel I would book for a London stay but booked it for some reasons as to closeness to station and so on. For being a five star hotel they do give you a full service from personnel to please, no complaints about this, but for us our idea of five star service is personel on alert but not on you all the time - but that’s us. Room was small but cozy. And needed one could go to the lounge to get soda or nibbling a or later on have a drink and cheese and others. Did have to call room service as the sheets were a bit stained and the warm water-bottle had broke in the bed. Hehe! Then in the service the forgot their phone ..  breakfast was really good and the offered gluten and lactose free alternatives. So been there and some that."
February 2018,Cozy and warm,I've stayed here twice and I loved it. The staff is super friendly and nice and made our stay perfect from the first minute until the last. I didn't complain about anything and that's very rare :-) the rooms are warm and cozy and I couldn't wait to fall into the bed at night. I would always come back!!! 
January 2018,Impressive not oppressive ,"Came for a weekend as a birthday treat, and was so impressed by the attention to detail at every level: the staff are incredibly helpful and welcoming, the rooms well decorated as per the whole hotel, the food delicious and some wonderful extra perks: free snacks, massive array for breakfast, personal touch down service (including little things like winding a USB lead up neatly, with a Velcro tie), plus offering a very tasteful and welcoming restaurant. This truly feels like an elegant town house vs. ‘Just another hotel’. It’s located right in the centre of London within a stones throw of main attractions, yet with the feeling you are cosily ensconced from the hectic frenzy of city life. Wow, we will be back!"
February 2018,London's No.1 Hotel for a reason!,"My wife and I have just returned from a short break at Hotel 41 and I can only describe this short break as amazing!!  From the minute we stepped into the entrance lobby we were treated like royalty!  The hotel is beautiful and very well maintained, our room was spotlessly clean and well serviced twice per day!  The staff could not do enough to make our visit extra special and the attention to detail was fabulous! The location could not be better and allowed us to walk most places we wanted to visit, however, coming back and sitting beside the cosy executive lounge fire on a cold February afternoon was fantastic! Well done to the team at Hotel 41, no question why it is London’s No.1 hotel!"
February 2018,Truly Fabulous,"Hotel 41 deserves the accolades it receives, everything about this beautiful boutique hotel is wonderful, from the welcome you get at the door, the drinks you're offered as you check in, the complimentary snacks, the ambience and the decor, the rooms and the en suites to the staff, all of whom are polite, helpful and clearly happy to go the extra mile, you are all credits to your organisation. The rose petals on the bed, the hot water bottles and the fireplaces in the rooms simply added to the feeling of luxury. We felt truly spoilt, thank you Hotel 41, we had the perfect night."
February 2018,fabulous,"Excellent hotel,   its not for everyone, if you want a busy hotel with a buzzy bar this is not for you, however if you want luxury, superb service great location and wonderful staff then you will love it. we could not fault anything highly recommend."
January 2018,Attention to the details ,"Superb service and a beautiful setting! Staff are quick to engage you in conversation, make suggestions and provide helpful tips, and make you feel welcome. I was always greeted by name and the staff took the time to learn more about my interests and my plans. I enjoyed the many personal touches...for example, after seeing a musical that I had mentioned in conversation earlier, I returned to my room that evening to find some small treats in connection to that same musical. The setting is lovely, presenting a cozy, yet classic feel. I stayed in an Executive Suite, which did not disappoint. Classic black and white styling with personal touches. Excellent location...within walking distance of many museums, theatres, restaurants, and Buckingham Palace. Also easy to access many…"
January 2018,Best of London,"My husband and I met our adult daughter in London for a few days of sight-seeing and to enjoy the city. Hotel 41 was our favorite part of the trip! We felt like we were the only ones staying there (even though we weren’t), the staff was so attentive, welcoming, and thoughtful. The breakfast in the lounge was delicious and fresh. A true taste of Britain with an exquisitely set table near the cozy fireplace.  They welcomed us at every turn, offering to help us with directions, recommendations, and even welcomed us with champagne!  We were here for our 30th wedding anniversary, and we are already looking forward to returning. This is the place we want to stay every time we visit London. Thank you to all who made us feel so welcomed! Our daughter had to leave for her flight at 3am,…"
January 2018,Wonderful experience,This Hotel is unbelievable. The Staff are exceptional and the facilities are second to none. We booked for my Wife's birthday and when we arrived in the room we had a selection of treats and a birthday cake. The executive lounge is a real winner but the staff really make the difference. This will now be our home from home when we visit London.
April 2017,Simply Wonderful,It has been a while since I have stayed at the Hotel 41 but it was a great experience.  The service and facilities are first class in all respects.  It was a great place for a business meeting.  The service provided to my invited meeting guest was perfect. 
January 2018,"Lovely service, we will be back","We had a very short stay here and it was as we expected from the other reviews. Staff very attentive and nothing too much trouble.  Despite the central location once you are upstairs and inside it is very quiet and we heard nothing in our room.   Lots of nice little touches abound like the complementary snacks, ice-cream and cheese in the evening. Turn down service folded our clothes and event tidied up charging cables. Breakfast was top notch.  We'll be back!"
January 2018,Birthday Weekend in London,Stayed in this fantastic hotel for my wife's birthday and had a the most memorable weekend.  I really believe that the key to 'Hotel 41's' success is that they manage to make you feel special from the moment you check in and are offered a glass of champagne till the moment you sadly have to leave.  We loved 'plunder the pantry' in the evening which I think is pretty unique all the way through to one of the best breakfasts we have ever had in the morning.  The service we received was exceptional with all staff being so friendly and personable and a huge thank you to the management team at Hotel 41 for the complimentary bottle of champagne left in our room which we enjoyed in front of the fire.
January 2018,I keep coming back!,"Never a disappointment, hotel 41 is the epitome of comfort, class and a top quality hotel with a lovely friendly atmosphere from the second you arrive with a glass of champers on check in and helpful, genuinely friendly staff and comfort at every turn. There’s the fabulous b bar cafe on one side of the hotel, with the best salt beef sandwich you’ll ever taste- and on the other, the wonderful Ruebens at the palace (sister hotel) with the new ‘curry room’ which serves the best currys along with superb cocktails, live music and wonderful service are the norm. You don’t need to travel very far to have a superb time and, like me, you’ll keep coming back again and again 😊"
February 2017,"The most wonderful hidden gem, we are so glad to have found it and can't wait to return","The most wonderful hotel, a real hidden gem. My husband and I both agree 41 is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in in the world, and we have visited quite a few! From point of booking and arrival at the hotel, right through to departure we felt like the most important people in the world. The service at 41 is impeccable, as is the decor throughout, not to mention the stunning array of food in the 'pantry'. We were served complimentary hot cheese and ham sandwiches (over a glass of wine and a game or two of chess on the balcony!!) before we went to see our show, as we ran out of time to go somewhere for dinner, and this was a really lovely gesture by the hotel. After seeing a show in town we returned to the hotel and we able to 'plunder the pantry' which was simply put,…"
November 2017,So different....,This might be the best hotel that I have ever stayed in.Not only were the staff spot on but the vibe was like no other hotel I have been too. Upon coming to the reception area the service was like no other I have had
July 2017,incredible accomodation,"Luxury Hotel, incredible service, nice surrounding area and amazing staff. I am always happy to come here when I have to visit London, is such a great experience and it become better at any new stay. Ok it's expensive but it's really a great way to spend my money because everything it's excellent!!!!!!  I just love this place"
December 2017,Incredible place like no other.,We stayed here for a night on the 19th December as it was our anniversary.  I had high expectations and they were completed exceeded. All staff without exception were friendly and welcoming. We were given an upgrade and we were blown away with the penthouse suite. The food was amazing and there was lots of it. The complimentary champagne on arrival was lovely. Afternoon tea and breakfast were superb. Thanks for a memorable trip. We will definitely return. 
December 2017,A Royal Honeymoon ,When you get married in Disney World  where do you go on your honeymoon? How about across the road from The queen of England?  Hotel 41 is the most luxurious experience from champagne welcomes to dvds & popcorn delivered to your room to high tea fit for royalty.  Even when you come back to your suite after a long day shopping at harrods what better way to do it than with rose petals covering ur room and a cosy hot water bottle in your turn down queen sized bed?  My husband and I fell madly in love with this hotel & we cannot wait for our next visit already!  Love the Robbs 
November 2017,The Best Hotel ,"Hotel 41 is the best hotel I have stayed at.  The personal service that the staff at Hotel 41 provided during our stay was excellent. They would greet us at the door, and in the lounge by our names. They would provide recommendations on places to see, restaurants to eat at, etc.  The rooms were spotless and evening turn down service always provided a treat, hot water bottles in the bed and a lip balm or another small surprise. "
December 2017,Maybe perfection,"Must be great when even your morning toast is shaped like a bunny!  Make a list of all the things you want in a five (maybe six) star hotel within 200 yards of Her Majesty’s backyard.   Now imagine a service level that matches this dream hotel.  Now, make a reservation at “41”!  You won’t regret it.  Enough said?  "
December 2017,"Second visit, amazing hotel","Our trip in early December was our second visit back to Hotel 41.  Great location-next to Buckingham Palace and Victoria Tube stop / National Rail.  Excellent staff - helped with musical tickets (at the last minute), dinner reservations and local recommendations at markets.  Logistics are great - fast, free Wifi (I was able to run my VPN without any issue), everything worked.  The details are not missed - turn down services are amazing, hotel water bottle in the bed and nightly sweet treats.  The Executive Lounge is great - perfect snacks, Raid the Pantry, drinks, fireplace, mingle with other guests if you want or don't.  We haven't been to every hotel in London but this is our favorite."
April 2017,Pure luxury with view of the stars.,"Stayed here for the third time and always is perfect. Love the posh and exclusiveness of the hotel. More like a secret hideaway. Our suite had a glass ceiling and we could watch the sky at night. Food delicious, staff very professional. Nice touches, like sweets, cakes and fruit it the room. All just perfect."
December 2017,Deserving of 6 stars!,"Deservedly Number 1 in London on TripAdvisor! My partner and I have just stayed for 1 night only but will definitely return. A wonderfully intimate and luxurious hotel where absolutely nothing is too much trouble, our room was beautiful, heavenly bed and brilliant shower and bathroom, the executive lounge with complimentary champagne on arrival and all day snacks and treats a real delight. We returned from dinner out to find our bed turned down, bedside candles lit and lights dimmed and a hot water bottle placed in my partners side of the bed...fantastic!  The full English breakfast was one of the best I have ever enjoyed, the home made hashbrowns superb! Thank you so much to all the staff, exemplary service and hospitality all round, we hope to return soon!  "
November 2017,Fantastic hotel with wonderful staff 10/10,"Customer service = top notch. Steve in the executive lounge was particularly helpful and friendly, giving us a great insight into the local area and made us all laugh. The rooms are exceptionally well decorated and cater to one's every whim; the room was equipped with hot water bottles and laptop cushions at our request, along with the elegant Penthaligon's toiletries. View of the golden carriage in the Royal Mews from our executive suite. Thoroughly recommend if in search of some high-end luxury."
December 2017,Another visit 3 years later......................,Short and to the point. Second visit and still the best in London.  Nothing too much trouble and no wonder its full most of the time. Tried to get in for later in the week and fully booked. Book in advance and enjoy how a 5 star hotel should be run.
June 2017,You won't be disappointed. Hotel 41 is simply AMAZING. Book. Now.,"Let's start with the service:  Hotel 41's customer service is unrivalled. This is the hotel other hotels should be looking at and learn from. Professional, committed and friendly staff that goes out of their way to help you. Oh you'll notice this as soon as you check in. And love it.   Hotel and rooms: Not the biggest hotel in London, but that doesn't mean the rooms are small. The room is spacious, well-designed and well equipped with pretty much everything that you could need for your stay.  Extrememly comfortable bed and stunning room will make you feel right at home.  Location: Hotel41 is located near Victoria station - one of the biggest hubs in London - which makes it easy for many to simply walk from the tube station to the hotel. If you're travelling from Gatwick you can…"
January 2018,Private Club Feel in Heart of London ,"The customer service is outstanding! Everyone that works there is smiling and friendly & you feel like they truly want to help you with anything you need.  I won’t stay anywhere else in London ever again other than Hotel 41.  From the customer service, to the quality of the food, to the comfort of your room....all 5 stars!!!"
December 2017,"Great hotel, excellent service ","We stayed in Hotel 41 for a week from Boxing Day until the first of January. From the moment we arrived we were amazed by the excellent service. The moment you check in the staff know you by name, they remember about everything you tell. We went to a show and the day after one of the staff asked us about the show.  In the lounge there are always some snacks (completely) and you can order about any drink you can think of. I was getting a bit ill during my stay (I catched a cold) and one of the staff told me I should drink a Toddy. Didn’t know what that was but see got one from me and it did help. The next few days several members of the staff asked me how I was doing.   We’ve stayed in several 5 star hotels but you can’t compare hotel 41 with any of these. Hotel 41 is a 5 star…"
December 2017,The Perfect Hotel,We were going to London for our honeymoon and decided to stay at Hotel 41 after seeing its high rating and great reviews.  The hotel and staff surpassed our expectations. The staff surprised us with a congratulations cake in our room. The room was spacious and comfortable and we looked forward to the nightly turn down service (loved the hot water bottle). The lounge was a great place to relax after spending a day sightseeing. We enjoyed the food and goodies from the Pantry. The staff were exceptional; very friendly and helpful.  The location of the hotel could not be better. Lots of great restaurants nearby and it was easy to travel all over London. We would never be able to stay anywhere else if in London and we're already planning a trip back.
November 2017,Ultimate Service,"The hotel was warm and welcoming and was an ideal home base for our time in London.  The room was a bit smaller than we expected, but what the room lacked in size, the staff made up for with their impeccable service.  The staff was extremely attentive and was happy to help with any request.  In fact, they even followed up with a special request after we checked out!  The hotel is well located, within walking distance to the train/metro station and many of the top sites in London.  Each evening, after a long day of sightseeing, we looked forward to the varied and delicious Plunder the Pantry offerings in the cozy lounge."
December 2017,Industry Excellence!,"The staff is remarkable. The property is exquisite. The location is unbelievable. From a Christmas tree in our room, stocking on our door and present under the tree, they made my daughter’s Christmas in London unforgettable. Thank you 41 Hotel"
November 2017,What a treat,This hotel is located directly across the street from Buckingham Palace and close to the tube.  My husband and I stayed here for three nights and were blown away by the service/cleanliness and attention to detail from this hotel. You are greeted at the front door and escorted up to a wonderful lounge area where you are given a glass of bubbly (really good) and olives while you get relaxed and checked into your room.  The room we were in was wonderful clean and by English standards quite roomy.  To my surprise on the first evening there was a water bottle in my bead which was a nice added touch to our stay and upon arrival there after it heated my bed before I retired to it lol.  Morning breakfast was included and it was yummy - I am a coffee snob and there coffee was good!!!!  I…
December 2017,Still amazing,"Our second stay at 41 was every bit as magical as the first. Perhaps helped, just a little, by the surprise upgrade to the wonderful Conservatory Suite (what an amazing treat - thank you!). Plunder the pantry food was varied and delicious, as were the canapes which accompanied our cocktails.  It was great to see some familiar faces, and a few new members of the team, all delivering the trademark service for which 41 is renowned. So tough to drag ourselves away from the lounge and back to the real world, but we're already planning our next visit."
July 2017,Top Hotel,This hotel is top notch. From the time you check in to your departure the staff makes you feel like royalty. The hotel is also in a great location. As an added bonus the “snacks” that are put out towards evening out are unbelievable. One night after a long day we had wine and the snacks it was a perfect end to the day. Keep up the excellent job.
December 2017,Once in a lifetime,There are no words to describe the experience of staying here. 7 stars.  Tucked away above the Reubens hotel you would never know that this luxurious hotel is there. Extraordinarily attentive staff with fantastic attention to detail. Food was wonderful.
November 2017,Small and Perfect!,"Great little London hotel! Staff was very helpful with our various needs (from arriving early to transportation) and we really enjoyed our stay. This hotel excels at all the little unexpected things, like leaving a hot water bottle in your bed at turndown, along with other treats like pillow spray or lip balm. The location is perfection, right across from Buckingham Palace and close to the Victoria tube and train station, so you can get to everywhere you need. The snack pantry was one of my favorite parts (all hotels should do this) and it was nice being able to grab a quick snack whenever you wanted! Rooms and bathrooms were well-appointed and quite spacious as well. I'd definitely return!"
December 2017,A wonderful stay in London,"The entrance to Hotel 41 is right next to The Reubens and quite discrete but once in welcomed by a very friendly Lukas who had already been a star by email, receiving a parcel and helping me prepare a surprise for my wife.  We were taken upstairs and booked in while being given a complimentary glass of champagne which we finished off sitting comfortably infront of the fire.  We had arrived very early and left our bags while going for lunch and on our return they were all in the room. We had booked the conservatory suite which features a glass roof and large double jacuzzi bath room.  The romantic turndown was a perfect end to our day.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and all the staff were friendly and managed to remember who we were and what we had done in order to ask how it…"
November 2017,Simply the Best!,"I love this hotel! The customer service starts with the reservationist, Nikki! She made the booking process seamless and is an asset to the hotel! Andrew, who seems to do everything at the hotel made my stay brilliant with all of the little touches like my favorite cupcakes and football on the tv 😊 Upon leaving, i contacted Nikki about another stay and although 41 is fully booked, she still helped me find a great place at a partner hotel! If you want to be treated like royalty... 41 is your place to stay! ps- the shower in the split level suite is AMAZING! "
November 2017,November,"Hotel 41 was booked as a surprise night away  for our 40th Birthday, by our lovely friends. We were greeted with a glass of complementary champagne and the experience just got better as the day continued. The staff just couldn't do enough for us, and it made for such an enjoyable stay.  The room was spacious and well equipped with everything that you could need for your stay. Exceptional service and can't wait to return to the hotel"
August 2017,Excellent service in a quaint setting,My wife and took a quick trip to London in August.  The service and room at Hotel 41 was top notch.  Great location to see many of the London sites.  The staff was on top of everything. We have no complaints. 
November 2017,Superb service,The service and attention to detail was exceptional. Nothing was too much trouble. An intimate hotel which caters for  each individual. The executive lounge is a perfect size providing a comfortable environment to relax. Fantastic venue for a special event. Husband was receiving his MBE and the hotel made him feel special and remembered all the detail of the event. 
October 2017,Simply Awesome!,"Definitely the best service I’ve ever encountered! My room was nice, view was poor, but I probably had one of the cheaper rooms (booked through Expedia). The perks that came in the cost of the stay were great (water, snacks, etc.) Definitely recommend!"
November 2017,Hotel before my visit to Buckingham palace for investiture,I stayed at this hotel with my wife and sister as it was only 200 metres from Buckingham Place. This is exceptional when it comes to customer service. Everything was perfect from the front desk to the room and the amazing Executive Lounge.  I stay in hotels all round the world and this beats them all. Small and a real throwback to the days when people were there to delight and serve. Give yourself an exceptional experience here.
November 2017,Wow wow wow,"If you got a room here you will never forget it. A small hotel but one of the best. Rooms are perfect but the main thing is the staff and the service. It is royal. The staff is the most professional and committed I have ever seen, even in hotels that are the best of the best on London, and I've been around all of them. A special note of recommendation should be given to Victoria that goes out of her way to make your stay perfect but this is true to all the staff. Of you have had here more stars I would have given then in this review. "
November 2017,Wow ,"Wow what a hotel, everything about this place is superb. I've. Never stayed in a hotel as lush as this. Immaculate. It's the Madonna of all London hotels. If looking to impress take a loved one or your other half here"
October 2017,Always a Warm Welcome!!,My husband & I have stayed at Hotel 41 for many years & its our Constant into London because we are welcomed as friends. If you want to feel The exclusive & Fancy a touch of the Best...Book in & see for yourself!:-) Enjoy!!
July 2017,My new favorite hotel,"We have stayed at hotels all over the world.  We prefer somewhat quirky boutique hotels and 41 Hotel fits that description perfectly.  The location is marvelous (just across the street from Buckingham Palace).  Our ""Junior Suite"" had a sitting room with fireplace and a flight of stairs up to a space with a desk and a good size bedroom and bathroom.  The furnishings and decor were lovely.  The room was immaculate.  Most important, the staff is absolutely wonderful.  We were known by name within minutes of our arrival.  There is food available in a large common room 24 hours a day.  Late buffet dinners there (included in the tariff) were delicious and perfect for jet lagged travelers (us) who returned late from theatre on several nights.  The entire staff went out of their ways to…"
July 2017,Impeccable Boutique Hotel in the Heart of London,"My wife and I celebrated our 10th anniversary in London. We chose Hotel 41 based on the many fantastic reviews on Trip Advisor. We were treated to impeccable service by all the staff from the moment we arrived to our departure. The staff is courteous, helpful, friendly, with a mixture of flair and British reserve. Our room was perfect, with a very comfortable bed, plenty of drawer and closet space. The bathroom had a bathtub/shower combination as well as a separate shower. Excellent water pressure and plenty of hot water for a long shower after a day of sightseeing. There is a lovely main sitting room which also doubles as a breakfast area, afternoon tea, dinner and late snack. The wait staff is attentive and caters to your requests. The hotel is perfectly situated with…"
August 2017,A secret hideaway right in the middle of bustling London…,"...that also happens to be the #1 hotel in the entire city (out of thousands of options).  We just returned from our third stay at Hotel 41 and were more impressed than ever.  While they’ve been #1 for years, it seems that they are actually getting better each stay.  They have somehow perfected the art of making a hotel feel like your home - that is, if your home is extremely posh and manned by the most helpful and friendly staff to be found.  The service is unmatched and well deserving of the five-star rating.  Perhaps most importantly, this is all delivered without any trace of pretension.  This is a place you can feel truly comfortable on your vacation.  We were only in town for two nights and had a lot packed into our schedule.  The staff arranged two cars, loaned us a temp…"
July 2017,Dropped in for tea,"Actually just dropped in for tea here as a bit out of my budget, but couldn't resist and pushed the holiday budget to be able to stay one night! It was perfect, and don't regret going there for a second. highly recommend"
May 2017,Pure luxury!- All that we had dreamed of and more! 💗,"We celebrated our 20th anniversary with our first trip to the UK in May. Hotel 41 was our home base for a weeklong packed trip which included long day excursion trips in England and Wales, every single day. This resulted in us not seeing much of London as planned our first day, due to a delayed flight. When staff learned that we were unable to see much in London, they presented us with a lovely book about London which was very sweet! The pampering we received when we returned every evening was so nice!  The bedding is extremely comfortable which was very important to me. The room was appointed beautifully, and treats were always left for us upon our return. The delicious after 7 ""plunder the pantry"" was a lifesaver for us as we were too exhausted for anything else. Anything you…"
August 2017,The BEST of the BEST!,"We chose  Hotel 41 for our stay in London based on all of the wonderful reviews.  This hotel was absolutely over the top with the most outstanding service we have ever received.  From the wonderful Check-In reception to the consummate host of the dining room, we were made to feel so at home and extra special. The public rooms of the dining and bar area are so inviting and our observatory guest room was such a great surprise.  Thank you to the management and each outstanding employee for making this hotel so outstanding and our stay so exceptional.  We will definitely be using Hotel 41 when our travels take us to London!!!!!! Thank you, Rick Fisher  Miami"
August 2017,Brilliant hotel - staff excellent,"So we took a punt, our usual and regular hotel in the vicinity had no rooms so we had to find another.  When you arrive don't miss the entrance between Bbar and the Rubens Hotel, but if you do err, then the staff at the Rubens will redirect you.  Once inside you are presented with a well appointed wood panelled corridor and a concierge desk.  The concierge will call up to get you escorted to the 5th floor, you will be treated by a polite and knowledgeable member of staff who tells you ""all the magic happens on the 5th floor"", and it really does.    it is all a little mysterious on first encounter, but all will become familiar quickly  You are escorted to the lounge which is also home to reception, where you are offered complementary champagne from a range of four on offer.  The…"
August 2017,Hotel 41,"Hotel name is very nice 41 and my lucky number was there so like name and aslonthey provide better service than most other hotel there so I like prefer to say please go there and yourself, and they give 5 rating out of 5.."
August 2017,Outstanding! Possibly the best place I have ever stayed. Easily top 2.,"The service here is already well documented (and deservedly so because it is out of this world) so I'll just get right to the second best highlight of our stay. We almost didn't book the 41 because of what looks to be missing. No bar, no restaurant, no meeting space. Luckily we let the location (across from the Royal Mews) and the reviews override our initial thoughts and booked anyway. There is NOTHING missing here. The lounge at the center of the hotel is a chameleon or transformer of a room that turns into whatever you need when you need it. Great bar, tea room, breakfast area, lunch/snacks, place to meet, whatever you want it to be it is. I know I said I wasn't going to rehash the service but....THE SERVICE!!!! Just incredible. So welcoming, so accommodating, so friendly. It…"
August 2017,Mini break ,"Hotel 41 is an amazing place - champagne on arrival, nibbles all through the day & fantastic service from all the staff. Best hotel in London in our opinion. We were treated to a romantic turn down on the first night - rose petals & dimmed lighting !  "
October 2017,Exceptional experience,"My husband and I stayed here in early October and our experience at Hotel 41 was ideal in every way from the moment we arrived, to our suite (upgraded for free--thank you Hotel 41!), an exceptional dinner in The English Grill with a complimentary scotch tasting, as well as surprise champagne and strawberries when we returned to our room after dinner. Our suite was unbelievable--two levels, fireplace, and a retracting ceiling so we could enjoy the stars at night. I've never seen anything like it. The location was ideal, in the heart of the city right by Buckingham Palace, and yet the hotel felt completely quiet and private. Employees Nicole, Patrycja and Andrew worked hard to make us feel like royalty. We loved our stay and wish we could have stayed longer!"
October 2017,Wow- secret treasure in London.,"The attention to detail at this hotel is unparalleled. The staff is impeccably perceptive- they anticipate your needs before you even know you have them! If you ask for a wake up call, they ask if what type Of coffee they can send with the call. If you walk through the door with luggage, they not only take your luggage, they personally walk you into the conservatory lounge and pour you a glass of champagne while they check you in. Sometimes they surprise you and upgrade you to one of their 6 exclusive suites- and give you turndown service with candles and rose petals. We feel like we stepped into an alternate reality- truly pampered and valued. We travel frequently and seek out lovely places to stay. We have never had an experience like this before! If you get a chance to stay…"
September 2017,A great place,The space that I stayed with my husband was definitely one of the best. The room had a particular scent to give of its welcomness. We stayed there for 2 days and we just wanted to stay but we had to get going to our next country.
April 2017,The best little hotel in London!,"This place is truly a gem. My sister and I stayed here for three nights--the staff greeted us by name on arrival, we had a beautiful upgraded room and there were ALWAYS really really good snacks!! The staff was friendly and helpful and all of them had a great sense of humor. Stay here!!"
September 2017,Completely Spoiled for Any Other Hotel Experience!,"My husband and I spent 4 nights with his 93 year old mother at Hotel 41.  I chose this hotel for its reputation for outstanding concierge service and the Executive Lounge experience.  The hotel and staff exceeded our expectations.  The rooms are beautiful, clean and offer every amenity.  The lounge is a special treat, offering delicious food at all times of the day. But most importantly, the staff is perfection!  Every request is met with a cheerful professionalism and genuine kindness.  We are completely spoiled for any other hotel experience in London or elsewhere, and we are well traveled in the U.S. and abroad."
October 2017,Outstanding in every way- A hidden gem!,"We recently stayed at Hotel 41 for a couple of nights for my 40th Birthday. This was a family visit with our two children, aged 9 and 5. The hotel is truly beautiful, both the building itself and the decor which is incredibly stylish and has real personality, no bland beige interiors here! Instead you can expect luxe black and white carpets, real orchids, classic dark wood and touches of gilt. Nothing is too much trouble for the wonderful staff here.  Check-in takes place in the lovely lounge where you are welcomed with a complimentary glass of a fantastic choice of champagnes. The lounge is also where meals are served and this delightful setting complete with real fire makes you feel very relaxed and 'at home' Our suite was wonderful, the rooms was beautifully decorated and…"
September 2017,Best staying,"Best place to staying here, good for honeymoon or family, food was so good and testy, best recomendation, clean and staff  so friendly to talking. We will come and stay again for nex time. When stay here also so easy go out anywhere. Good and must be come again. "
August 2017,surprise upgrade,"We visit London every few years and always stay at the Rubens at the Palace Hotel.  We found it on line over ten years ago and told our travel agent about it.  The Rubens is a great hotel and part of Red Carnation Hotels (more on them later).  When we arrived at the hotel this past August, we were greeted at the door as usual and escorted to the front desk. We were informed that our room was upgraded to the hotel next door; the 41!!   I just finished reading the August copy of Travel Leisure and remembered the 41 was rated #1 in London ahead of The Goring.  Needless to say, my wife and I were excited.  We were escorted to the elevator up to the top floor of the hotel and into the magnificent lounge (think a private club atmosphere).  We were given the Balmoral Suite which was…"
September 2017,Above the Rest!,"We had the absolute pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in mid-September for 5 days. There is a reason this hotel is number 1, and it comes down to service.  The words, ""no or we can't"" do not exist in the staff's vocabulary. Hence, the ""whatever, whenever"" button on your hotel room's telephone.  We have been fortunate enough to stay in very nice hotels all over the world, but we can honestly say, the service at Hotel 41 exceeded all of them.  We are not going to single out one person on the staff because everyone was truly exceptional.  The hotel is very much like a secluded club, an oasis if you will, in a bustling big city. It was a pleasure coming back to Hotel 41 after a long day of taking in the sites of London. The atmosphere of the lobby was very tranquil. The candles, music…"
September 2017,OUTSTANDING,"By far the most outstanding, professional, accommodating, informed and courteous staff.  Have been to some of the finest Hotels here and abroad. It does not have the glitz of a Ritz, what it does have is an intimate, classy and peaceful setting.  You do feel like it is a home away from home.  There is delicious food all day in the Executive Lounge.  The room has quality toiletries as well as toothbrushes, shaving kit, sewing kit, iron and board etc.  Each day 2 bottles of water and a sweet treat.  The location is away from the craziness around Trafalgar and Piccadilly, yet very convenient.  2 minute walk to Victoria Station. Thank you to all the staff at Hotel 41 for providing a wonderful first time London experience."
August 2017,The only place i will stay in London,Undoubtedly one of the best hotels in the world in terms of exclusivity and exquisite treatment to customers. The details that make the stay unforgettable are innumerable. For a London feeling this is the place!
September 2017,Always wonderful,"Hotel 41 is a home away from home, and we love staying here. Book as far in advance as possible as it is very popular. We worry about writing a review in case we can't get in next time we're in London - we certainly wouldn't stay anywhere else given a choice. Customer satisfaction is their top priority, and they always succeed."
August 2017,Our second stay - just as awesome as our first!,"otel 41  London  520468664  We stayed here about 3 years ago and loved it so much we gave friends a voucher as a birthday gift. When they couldn't use it, they returned the voucher to us and off we went back to Hotel 41. Staying here is a truly a classically enjoyable experience in what great service ought to be. A small hotel occupying one floor of a building, they have a handful of rooms and a large staff so they can offer really exceptional service. I felt as if there was no ""nickle and diming"" you - snacks and beverages are available all day in the Executive Lounge where you can enjoy a great buffet breakfast. At night, they offer turndown service and will tidy up the room again and provide fresh towels. They place bottled water each evening by the bed. We loved being able…"
September 2017,Superb,"I've stayed in 5 star hotels around the world, and one question I ponder is, ""what makes a luxury hotel different?""  I think it could be how comfortable and welcome they make you feel as a guest.   Here are some ways Hotel 41 does that: 1. Staff is waiting in the lobby to escort you to check in. You are offered a cold (or warm) drink, and taken care of immediately. 2. A personal note welcoming you is waiting in your charming room. 3. Among other things in the room: the remote control is in a baggie (they've sanitized it!), water waiting by the bed, a candle lit in the bathroom, heated towel racks--honestly, anything you could think of, it's there. And if it's not? They will get it for you. I needed a curling iron with a UK plug. I had it in less than 5 minutes. 4. The staff all…"
September 2017,What's The Difference That Makes The Difference?,"Rather than wax lyrical about the superb furnishing of the hotel, the perfect location and the unparalleled quality of customer care and service, and rather than replicate the many fine words of praise set down by others, I thought I'd try to highlight what for me, makes staying at Hotel 41 so special.    As with my stays at all other hotels, I plugged my phone into the charger overnight, and took it with me on my walks about town the following day.  On my return I found the lead had been neatly coiled, and a piece of Velcro helpfully attached to keep it that way.  (Please see photo).  I know it's only my opinion but for me, this is a perfect example of what the whole Hotel 41 experience is about - the efforts made by a team of people to anticipate my needs and satisfy them…"
August 2017,Customer Service x 1000.,"As the hotel management intern from Portugal said, ""This hotel takes customer service to a new level. There is not better place I could learn."" From the moment we arrived, we felt like we were being waited on hand and foot. We needed a bathroom in which to change after arriving from an overnight flight...We were given a room! We then came back from a tour and could hardly stay awake after being up 24 hours 9( bad flight). It was not yet check-in time. They gave us a room in which to take a nap! Look at the photos and see what they offer, but you cannot see from words or photos what extraordinary customer service they provide. Other things we loved: We were within walking distance from Buckingham Palace-across from the Mews. Wonderful, safe location near lots of restaurants.…"
December 2016,Bliss,"I happened to stumble upon this hotel by accident but am I glad I did! We have our annual '41' stay each year leading up to Christmas and I look forward to it all year. We have stayed in rooms and suites and can honestly say that it is top class. Nothing is too much trouble. Guests are treated like royalty and the staff go out if their way to make sure your stay is special. From the complimentary champagne on arrival to the little treats they leave in your room, so far we have had a birthday cake, basket of fruit, wine and a signed photo from the cast of wicked when we went to see it a couple if years ago. We love the executive lounge and the honesty bar and last time, we were sent home with a goodie bag for the train journey home! Please don't change anything, you are perfect!…"
August 2017,Details are priority,This hotel goes above and beyond for all guests. The vibe of just checking in the hotel is a vintage royal English welcoming with a glass of Champagne and some chocolates waiting in your room. I was impressed by the towel warming racks in the restroom. They basically do everything they can to make you feel at home. I stayed in a Executive King room which was perfect for 2 people. If you have a lot of luggage you might have to think about upgrading. We had room service on both nights we stayed because most pubs in the area closed at 11. Thank you to the staff  that went above and beyond while we stayed there.
August 2017,Perfect experience!,"My daughter and I vacationed here for several days.  The hotel is gorgeous, but what made it an exceptional experience was the efficiency, kindness and friendliness of the staff!  The afternoon tea is not to be missed.  The presentation was lovely and the treats delicious.  In addition, their ""plunder the pantry"" is a generous and thoughtful way to welcome travelers weary from a long journey.  The little extras such as the turndown service in the evening also made for a perfect vacation.  Very memorable!"
August 2017,exceptionalpersonalized service,"The warm and friendly  staff delivered exceptional service, They realized my daughter was entering university shortly and provided her a surprise congratulatory decorated cake!  Small details were all looked after and their timing for fulfilling any request was outstanding. They were engaging without any feeling of being overbearing."
August 2017,Stunning hotel & staff,"What a lovely treat in London - Hotel 41 - from the welcome at the door, drinks upon check in, attention to detail by the staff, beautifully appointed rooms, to the delicous ""help yourself"" food available at the bar, and scrumptious breakfast in the relaxed informal lounge. Outstanding all round - thanks Hotel 41!"
September 2017,Shaun and Kelly,"The most impressive accommodation of our three country visit. Every detail of our stay was well attended. The service was impeccable and tailored perfectly. The room was beautiful, and the location of the property was perfect. Being in the business of delivering an exceptional customer experience, I learned a few things on how to understand the importance of exceeding expectations. We were truly spoiled at Hotel 41, and felt very welcomed.   Thank you to the entire team at Hotel 41! "
September 2017,There is a reason why this Hotel is Number 1 on Trip Advisor!,"For location, service and just great attention to detail this hotel cannot be beaten. A big thanks to Malcolm and his team for making our stay here again so enjoyable.  If you are visiting London this hotel is opposite Buckingham Palace with Victoria station just 2 minutes walk away.  The staff are so helpfull, the rooms beautiful and the standards of cleanliness and quality of the bed linen are just awesome.  My advice is ""book it"" :)"
September 2017,Whatever! Whenever!,"There is a phone button marked ""Whatever! Whenever!"" in the room: this best describes the experience we had. Top-notch service, excellent breakfast and the fantastic ""Conservartory Suite"" made this a high-class stay in London. All is very british, especially the Afternoon Tea (really, try it!). Fine room perfumes, king size bed, 24h service and a fantastic view through the glass roof. One of the best five hotels we have been so far!"
September 2017,It's a Dogs Life,"If your looking for some last minute luxury with your dog Theodore can highly recommend 41, and we loved it too, we normally stay at the sister hotel in Kensington which is fabulous also, but we think we may have been swayed over to 41. It's definitely a home from home experience with only 28 rooms, lovely homely lounge with food on tap all day, we really enjoyed our evening in with yummy salad jars, shepherds pie, cheese ice cream and a really great bottle of wine, all the staff are just perfect a special giggle on arrival I chose a glass of pink champagne and Theo opted for the Bottom Sniffer beer rather than the Pawsecco. The room was beautifully clean, exceptionally well equipped and presented."
September 2017,Book this right now!!,"For our anniversary my husband surprised me with a trip to London. Although he booked the trip I booked the hotels so I finished the internet looking for the best hotels in London. We stayed at another 5 star hotel for the first few nights in soho and after a side trip came back to London to the 41. Although our first hotel was a true 5 star and quite immaculate, the 41 was in a league of its own!   The service is what makes the hotel out of this world! When tired and starving I went to the hotel staff to see if someone could help me find a sushi place for dinner (it was already 8pm- during London fashion week) I had no less than 3 people calling around and booking us at several different restaurants so we could pick where we wanted to go! They got us into Nobu and we were off…"
September 2017,The best hotel,"The best hotel I have stayed on. Very clean and service is superior. The staff help you with anything you ask for and you can always go to the lounge and find something nice to eat. It's not just a hotel, it's an great experience. Whould highly recommend this hotel. "
September 2017,Fantastic weekend,"Me and my collegues (6 persons) had an amazing stay in this hotel from friday - sunday. The atmosphere is really friendly and nice, the people that work there are extremely serviceminded and I could not ask for any better treatment. The ""whatever whenever"" button on the phone says it all. :)  The bed was really good to sleep in, the best I have ever had. Even better than the one I have at home. :) And the drink and food was also a really nice experience. Thank you Hotel 41 for the best hotel-experience of my life. "
September 2017,Unbelievable comfort service location!!,"Loved 41!!! Happened upon it- we didn't know it was trip advisor #1. Everyone was very real and helpful- food great. Location perfect. The extras were extremely notable- sheets, bath products. I won't go anywhere else in London! "
May 2017,Top Notch,"After a long and exciting trip through mainland Europe, we were tired and wanted to spend a few days in London.  We needed some major pampering after traveling to multiple countries.  The 41 did NOT disappoint.  The staff was genuinely welcoming and helpful, the hotel room was comfortable and beautifully decorated, and the main salon was a great place to sit and refresh.  My husband and I plan look forward to staying at The 41 again when we visit London.  I loved this boutique hotel!"
May 2017,Hospitality at it's very best,"My wife and I spent two very enjoyable nights in this wonderful hotel - actually, it's more like a private club.  From the moment we entered the door, we were treated to very friendly, personal and professional service from every staff member that we met. The ambiance is such that the Executive Club room - where everything takes place - is the perfect place to relax and 'chill out'. There is a comprehensive bar with complimentary snacks available and they offer a meal service as well. At all times, there will be attentive staff waiting to deal with your every whim - they go out of their way to make Hotel 41 feel like a 'home from home'. The rooms are extremely comfortable and well appointed and the power of the shower was something to behold!  This boutique hotel sets the…"
June 2017,Never stayed anywhere like this,We arrived to a very friendly welcome. Efficient check in aided by a glass of champagne. Could not fault the friendly efficient relaxed service. Beautiful room. Excellent breakfast and delicious pantry to help yourself to. We loved every minute. 
May 2017,"great room, great service, great drinks and breakfast","We stayed in room 29, which was a perfect sized room. One of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on. The staff kept bringing little gifts and treats every night, which made our 10 year wedding anniversary very special."
May 2017,We have christened this 'our hotel' in London!,"We had the pleasure of staying in Hotel 41 recently and it was a stellar experience. From the moment we entered, we were treated warmly, and welcomed like family. EVERYONE from start to finish was warm, friendly, and professional. Every single thing we experienced in this hotel was top notch.  When planning our trip to the UK, we used a travel agent who had suggested hotels for each of our venues. Hotel 41 was not the agent-suggested hotel for London, however after doing my own research I was confident that this was the hotel we wanted. The location is excellent, being very close to Buckingham Palace and within walking distance of much that we were interested in seeing in our short (2 night) stay in London. The quality of the service, as others have mentioned, surpasses all…"
June 2017,The best,It's the best without any doubt. Staying somewhere else will be a injustice to London visit. Superb rooms and great location. Service is great. Good is a little expensive. Rest is as a like all reviews says. The best.. u hoo
February 2017,Amazing,"This is the best hotel We have ever stayed in. Staff are excellent, they cannot do enough for their guests. Only one night stay, wished we could have stayed longer. We felt so relaxed and pampered.   Romantic turndown fantastic. Great location.  Everyone should stay here at least once in their lifetime. "
May 2017,Incomparable service... a must!,"Hotel 41 has definitely the best service we have ever experienced among all the very good hotels we have been to. From the moment they welcome you, they are full of warm and heartfelt attentions. Yet without being too much. The staff has been of very good advices which definitely emphasized the quality of our stay in London. Frankly, we have been highly impressed by our experience and will definitely stay there next time around. The hotel is also very well located which makes it even more interesting. It is small, full of charm and truly worth the expense! Enjoy!!"
May 2017,Excellent Service great location,"Had a lovely stay here whilst attending a royal garden party. The location for this was perfect only a short walk from the palace. It's not like any hotel I've previously stayed in because it's located on the fifth floor, accessed by a small lift. The ground floor entrance is very nice and it feels like a private members club, which again is nice. Reception is based within the 'executive lounge' which is a beautiful room with a small split level gallery where you can have some more privacy if wanted. We were greeted very well with a complimentary glass of fizz ( four to choose from!) service on the whole during our stay was very good in deed save for a couple of minor issues. Firstly, our WHB tap was loose and they failed to fix it after I'd reported it. Secondly there was a…"
May 2017,It is without doubt the best hotel in london,"Hotel 41 is a wonderful small hotel near Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station. It´s location makes it very easy to reach the interesting locations of London very easy. Hotel 41 and its staff offer the best service that you can imagine. There is a wonderful and warm welcome each time we arrive. The rooms are perfectly designed in black and white. The turn down service is perfect - water provided for the night, a small sheet of paper with the weather forecast and tips for the next day. The breakfast offers either a buffet or a typical English breakfast - be careful if you order it - it is huge! We aleays love the conversation with the staff. There is always the feeling that the staff is really interested that everything is okay. It remains the best hotel in London."
May 2017,You have to stay here,"This hotel is amazing, every part of it is a wonderful experience and worth the value. I can't ever imagine staying anywhere else while in London! I wish every hotel operated like this one. Thank you for the wonderful time! "
May 2017,'Mini-moon' - one night stay,We stayed for one night just after we got married to have a little 'us' time as we had a large amount of guests from abroad staying in London for our wedding. The level of service is exceptional and the room decor and quality is true luxury. The free food at supper time is amazing and free champagne on arrival oh and the free ice-cream! - everything is just fantastic - We loved it - and just what we needed after a hectic wedding schedule. Was tempted to book another night but we had family obligations the next day that we couldn't get out of. I guess the only slight limitation is that there is only one communal area - the 'lounge' where you eat breakfast and which is fantastic but there are no views out of the windows in the bedrooms or the lounge so you do feel a little…
June 2017,Excellent location,"This is our second stay at the Hotel 41 and everytime, it is perfect.The design is classical and the whole building is perfctly renovated.  We really appreciated the welcome of the staff (florent). Our room was beautiful and very confortable."
July 2017,Simply Top Notcg,A true luxury hotel in every sense of the word. Outstanding facilities and the entire team could not have done more for us.   The location is central to all things London. And returning after a day on the town to the Hotel 41 Lounge is a marvelous way to conclude the evening.   The staff members we encountered went out of their way to insure everything we desired was provided and they were genuinely nice people.   I won't stay anywhere else in London after experiencing 41! 
July 2017,Our third visit ... Flawless!,"It was an absolute pleasure to return to this coveted gem. No need to go into the details because other guests have covered all the details.   My husband and I really appreciated being able to freshen up after the long flight by having access to a special room reserved for early arrivals.   Even though I tried 3 weeks prior to our stay, I was unsuccessful in obtaining SkyGarden tickets due to it being the busy summer season. I had communicated my disappointment via email to Hotel 41 stating how difficult it is to obtain these passes - I even tried as soon as they opened up the reservation window. It was a complete surprise to have found out upon our arrival that reservations were made for afternoon lunch at Darwin Brasserie at SkyGarden. Hotel 41 kindly provided a credit on our…"
July 2017,I love this hotel!,"Everything about this hotel is superior.  The hotel is located right next to Buckingham Palace, and our room was lovely, quiet, and comfortable.  The staff is amazing!  Every member of the staff that we came into contact with was friendly, helpful, and welcoming.  I appreciate being allowed to check in several hours early after our overnight flight from the US."
July 2017,Simply Amazing,"My family and I stayed here for 9 days. As you step through the doors you are greeted by the gorgeous interior and amazing staff. You'll be ushered up to the 5th floor to the Executive Lounge where you will enjoy a glass of champaign of your choosing and hors d'Oeuvres. The staff is at your beck and call the entire stay and strive to treat each guest like royaltiy. Even the children!   Once you have recieved your royal welcome, you will be lead to your room. What a room it is! We had two, each just as gorgeous as the next. Each night you will enjoy turn down services and special treats left by housekeeping such as a variety of snacks, bottled water both sparkling and flat, lip balms, relaxing pillow sprays and more.   Our children, 16 and 13 years old, loved the Executive Lounge…"
July 2017,"Best Service Ever ,  Anywhere","A different Hotel  than most fine luxury hotels  .  Everything you might expect from a top rated hotel , with one major  exception , the service was better than any hotel I have ever stayed in .  No matter what you asked for , it was done in a gracious , and experienced manner . I would suggest that you stay in a suite with the separate sitting room . You will not believe this hotel , and it has a wonderful location , being next to Buckingham Palace . The Royal Mews are across  the street , and it is worth the visit ."
May 2017,"""Secret"" hotel with wow factor service","You aren't supposed to reveal secrets, but this one is hard to keep. Enter the lobby and take the lift up to the lounge, you will be transported to an environment stripped of the London hustle and bustle. As you enter you are offered a beverage while your rooms in being arranged and once you sit down with your drink any stress from traveling or running around London just seems to drift away in the timeless turn of the century London interior. The rooms are what you expect from a high end boutique hotel. Great beds, luxury linens and toiletries - it's all there. What makes it stand out from the rest is the staff who outdo themselves at every chance they get, 24 hours a day, with everything from skilled bartenders to creative chefs. Best of all is the lounge staff who will sort…"
July 2017,"Great boutique hotel, intimate may be a bit too intimate.",I booked this hotel because of the ratings & rave reviews from the guests. I booked it despite that there weren't bigger rooms available. We booked into the Executive King suite and it was really very small. We hardly had any room to put anything away and we were spilling out of the room by the end of our stay. The bathroom especially is very tiny and had very limited room to put your toiletries in between two people. I had to leave all my stuff on the desk which cluttered that space and made it messy. The plumbing is also quite old and the water faucet that controls temperature was broken and fiddly. The water didn't drain well which is a pet peeve of mine.  It was a mistake booking here in a standard room & a bad judgment call on my part as in general we do tend to value space…
July 2017,Cannot wait to visit again,"This was my third stay at Hotel 41 and yet again it did not disappoint on any level. When planning my trip to the UK I knew Hotel 41 would the only place to stay while in London. The service is impeccable but not stuffy and nothing is too much trouble. I love the lounge where one can linger over a pot of tea or a glass of wine and feel as if you were in a private home. Breakfast is served there and it is cosy and unhurried. The staff are friendly and attentive and always have a smile. Love the cosy rooms with every small detail thought of - lots of fluffy towels, a great shower, comfortable bed and floating votive candles in the bathroom with the turndown service to name a few. I cannot wait for my next stay!!!!"
May 2017,Brilliant hotel,"We love this hotel! It is just like a club, revolving around the executive lounge. We stayed here for 3 nights and were very sad to leave. The staff members were absolutely brilliant. We had many great chats with the staff members in the lounge that made us feel so at home. Our room was extremely comfortable, although we could not get the separate shower to work, so we used the shower over the bath instead. The location near Buckingham Palace and St James's Park was superb. The food in the lounge was very good and plentiful. I loved the 'plunder the pantry' in the late evening and also the many snacks which came with our drinks.  We are returning to London for 2 nights in September, but sadly, will not be staying at 41 as it is booked out for our dates, proof of what a great…"
July 2017,They make magic happen...,"Just back from our second visit to this remarkable, glorious hotel.  Calling it a hotel doesn't seem right.  It's more a private club, a home from home where, just like at Hogwarts, magical creatures (called the staff) work away to meet your every need and wish, usually before you were even aware of that need.  Amazing. From checking in sipping a choice of four champagnes, to the beautifully appointed rooms (those beds are soooo comfy), to the perfection that is the Executive Lounge, to the wee surprises awaiting your return after an evening in the second best city in the world (I'm a Londoner by birth and upbringing, but now live in the best of all cities, Edinburgh 😊).  The purpose of our visit was to attend the third of Adele's concerts at Wembley. Waking up on Saturday…"
June 2017,They treat you like Royalty!,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel 41 for my 65th birthday.  They treat you like Royalty!  The service is outstanding and they even had a birthday cake and a card in my room upon arrival! The food in the Executive Lounge is outstanding....and it is available for breakfast, lunch, tea, dinner and after-dinner heavy snacks.  The service in the Executive room is impeccable.  The location of the hotel was perfect for us as we could easily walk to the Royal Mews, Buckingham Palace, and even Big Ben, Parliament, Westminster Abbey, and the Churchill War rooms.  The rooms had every amenity and were very clean and well serviced.  Everything about the hotel was luxury."
June 2017,Perfect!,"Lost count of the number of times we have stayed at 41 over the last 5 years and we keep coming back because it's the best hotel we have ever experienced.  The team are exceptional in the way they care for their guests.  A few examples on this trip were; being taken up on the roof with champagne to watch the flypast for trooping of the colour, being left a thoughtfully prepared gift in the room the night before we went to see a concert, are just a few of the reasons why we return. It's great to see so many familiar faces in the 41 team each time we return and they greet you with genuine warmth.  They are all great fun and are encouraged to be themselves, not to interact with the formal stuffiness you can experience in other luxury hotels. It feels unfair to single anyone out as…"
August 2016,My new London home,"A small boutique hotel directly opposite Buckingham Palace. I loved this place. The staff went out of their way to make me feel special. I have NEVER had service like this before in my life. The rooms were gorgeous but, be warned, they are in a converted terrace house so are small, dark and oddly shaped at times. Quirky definitely works as a description. I still really enjoyed it as the rooms were very unique. The breakfast was superb and the ice-cream freezer available 24 hours a day was fantastic! Love it when hotels do something a little different. Can't thank everyone on staff enough. I had a sensational stay and felt like the most important person in the world."
June 2017,First class hotel,"This hotel does not have a pool or golf course, but I'll match its service level with any world class hotel I have stayed at, and I've stayed at the tops hotels around the world.  The staff is very well trained with personal attention to all your needs.  The hotel is located at the heart of London with very tight security.  We felt very safe, which is important especially with recent terrorist attacks in London.  Well don!"
June 2017,Our new London home!,"Very small boutique hotel with only 28 rooms and a 2 to 1 staff to guest ratio.  Simply the best and most personalized service anyone could ask for.  All of the staff know your name and room number and remember all of your preferences.  We had a problem with the bathroom sink faucet on the second day, and it was taken care of immediately with a complimentary bottle of wine as an apology. Beautiful classic atmosphere and first class accommodations.  Worth every penny spent.  We will be back.  Maitre'ds Stephan Otto and Andrew Muir were fantastic as was all of the staff.  Can't wait to come back."
June 2017,The MOST incredible experience ,"Our stay at Hotel 41 for the weekend was simply amazing. From being greeted at the front door to anticipating our every need, we experienced a weekend that was truly unforgettable. The service and genuine care you receive from the staff is exquisite. We highly recommend this hotel experience to maximize your time in London. And we will be back. "
June 2017,"Excellent service, incredible location","The service at Hotel 41 is just wonderful. We stayed there for three nights, and the small service touches were nice, e.g. they took the time to ask whether we were vegetarian (my wife is) and then the chef made a separate appetizer for her over the complimentary afternoon snacks.  The location is perfect if you are there as a tourist -- one block from Buckingham Palace, and easy walking distance to Big Ben, The National gallery, and much more, and one block from the tube. Their executive lounge is perfect to relax with great light food (complimentary) and drinks. The price of the hotel (it is a bit on the expensive side) was worth it.  However, this is still London, where space is at a premium. So the rooms are not large, and the executive lounge is cosy as opposed to grand.…"
June 2017,BEYOND EXCELLENT! Simply superlative and more,"I usually don't post on Trip Advisor because frankly I find it a place where folks overhype a place or have an ax to grand and rarely use it as a once source for my travel needs. This one is an exception. This boutique luxury hotel is mind-blowing in terms of service and taking care of one's unique travel needs. If you need to be near Buckingham Palace or Victoria Station, there is no choice but Hotel 41. On this trip I needed all type of different stuff that I usually do - dry cleaning, pressing, ice cream at 2:45 am, tux pick up and return, even a haircut and beard trim. No request was not met with a same. The executive lounge is you private pantry and bar and is stocked with liquors you never heard of. I have done a fair amount of traveling and always been disappointed when a…"
February 2017,Luxury private club atmosphere at a fair price,"This is a really interesting place. I stayed over with someone who was a hotel guest and was pleasantly surprised by this understatedly opulent place.  The hotel lobby is rather deceptive because it just seems like a narrow entryway tucked between a restaurant entrance and the entrance to another hotel next door, The Rubens, which is a sister property to Hotel 41 - they are both part of the Red Carnation chain of hotels. Once upstairs, however, you get the full experience of lush, chintzy luxury with a lot of restraint thrown in - everything's really pricey looking but not in a way that's ostentatious. There's just enough of a whiff of excess to make it all seem like you're in a really great property.  The room we were in was a bi-level suite - the ground floor had a little…"
November 2016,Superb! ,"I'm a little late reviewing the superb Hotel 41 it has to be the best hotel I've ever stayed in, the staff were absolutely wonderful and the ambience of this wonderful home from home was just what my husband and I needed for a short Xmas shopping break. This hotel deserves all the awards and accolades it receives I can't wait for my next visit. "
April 2017,An amazing weekend away!,"We wanted to escape to London for a romantic weekend away, to catch a show, see some sights and stay somewhere that felt 'special'...  Hotel 41 is 'special'!  Throughout our stay the service was exceptional, the entire team being friendly, warm and always willing to go that extra mile for us.  I had arranged for a few additional surprises for my partner and Hotel 41 didn't disappoint and in fact exceeded my expectations.  We would particularly like to thank Andrew for his great service and personal touch during our stay - you're a credit to the industry and the hotel.   Our room was excellent with all the amenities you would expect and more from robes in the bathroom to sound proof glazing and one of the most comfortable beds I have ever had the pleasure to sleep in. (I would…"
November 2016,Believe the hype ,"Thought other reviewers may have exaggerated, but no it really is that great. Had an amazing time from the champagne welcome, to the well stocked ""snack"" bar.  Amazing staff, especially Steve Jones in the lounge and Mitchell for his great dinner recommendations. "
April 2017,simply the best ,"This was my fourth visit to 41 and was greeted by Bastien on entering 41. Once in the lounge Bastien reminded me that whilst here I didn't need to do anything and this statement to me sums up 41. The staff treat everyone with a friendly warm manner and aim to take care of even the smallest detail which was evident when after my daughter said she had sore feet after walking they put a foot spa in our room. Nothing is too much trouble for the team at 41 and will try to help you with anything as I discovered when I asked for pain killers as my daughter had a headache and some one went out on a Sunday morning to get some. Lauren, Magdalena and the rest of the staff make 41 the truly memorable it is. My daughter celebrated her 25 birthday whilst here and after seeing wicked we found…"
April 2017,Service like no other!,"Hotel 41 is a quaint boutique hotel in London on Buckingham Palace road, a very short distance to Victoria and Buckingham Palace.  It's a hidden gem  Service is beyond exceptional and no detail is overlooked.  The Executive Lounge is the perfect place to enjoy breakfast, afternoon tea, pre and post dinner drinks, etc.  While the rooms are modest in size, they have all the charm that you would expect from a luxury resort.  It's a place I highly recommend and already have plans to return to in the fall."
April 2017,Outdone Themselves Again,"I was unsure about writing this review given my preference to keep the hype about this hotel down a notch (and be able to actually book a room without it being full), but they just deserve each and all the rave comments. A wow defines it all.   Yes, I have stayed at The Connaught, at the Mandarin, at the Dorchester, at the Claridges, and the Rosewood; but since we found this jewel, not going back to these other hotels any time soon. They cannot dare challenge the level of detail and excellence that is put by each staff member onto their work. The ""homey"" feel paired with the standards of luxury are, in my opinion, unrivaled.   Being unfair as it is to name some and not all, Mr. Steve Jones is illustrative of the distinctive nature of the place and is the very definition of a…"
March 2017,High level service like no other!,"Our recent stay 41 Hotel was delightful in every way!  From the professional and energetic staff who guided us with dining, theater, directions, and our every whim and need, not a detail was missed.  Service was rendered with the utmost of care and polish. Snacks were abundant, a fireplace in our room was a bonus, and every night a new treat appeared for turn down- rose petals, votives burning, pillow scent spray, chocolate dipped wafers in organza black bags.  I think this place is a real hidden gem."
March 2017,Best Service we have ever experienced ,"Wow is all we can say.  From the moment our cab pulled up we were greeted with big smiles and wonderful attitudes.  Brought up to our beautiful rooms, they accommodated us with a 9am check in, what a treat after getting off an international flight.  Super cozy beds, great showers, and so many freebies. On the first day the staff had already memorized our names, and some how they know as we are headed down the elevator and have your cab waiting, or whatever else you might need.    For my sons birthday they made it so special, gave him sparkling juice in the morning to celebrate, a custom cake left in the room in the afternoon (as he has food allergies), and left him and his brother a gift with a card signed from the whole staff in the evening.  Who does stuff like that?!?   …"
November 2016,Best birthday treat EVER,"I live in London but it's always fun to stay somewhere nice, be treated like a queen and play tourist and that's what my friend did for me.  We stayed here the day after my birthday.  From the moment you arrive, the concierge took over, our bags were taken to our room, we were given complimentary drinks and then also escorted upstairs.  I found a huge fruit basket and birthday cake upon arrival and the staff all wished me a happy birthday.  We unpacked, the room wasn't huge but it wasn't small, it felt cosy, the bed high and comfy and a bathroom filled with Penhaligon products. He had booked an afternoon tea in the salon, which is where we went next, it was very nice and the salon itself was lovely, I suppose it could feel crowded if completely full but there were only 2 other…"
May 2017,Unbelieveable Experience,"In traveling many places in the world, we have not experienced such outstanding accommodations as we did during our stay at Hotel 41. First, it's location is just down the street from Buckingham Place, and is convenient to most attractions. Hotel 41 has a limited number of rooms, which convey the feeling of being special. To that point the service and  dedication to detail is without approach. The quality of the dining was excellent. The staff was very friendly and responded to every need, truly professional. If you desire the best, Hotel 41 should be your selection! Glenn & Kae Erickson, Danville, California, USA"
May 2017,Wonderful stay after a memorable afternoon at a Royal garden Party,"From the moment we arrived nothing was too much trouble for the incredible staff at Hotel 41. We were made to feel like part of the family. The personal service extended to friends who joined us for drinks before supper. Our room was beautiful, light and airey with candle as part of the turn down service. Canapes and snacks were plentiful and delicious. We will certainly return for a special occasion"
May 2017,The Best Hotel In The World,"This was the best hotel stay I've ever experienced.  It is a smaller hotel, so you feel pampered and taken care of with a personal touch from every employee who all greet you with a smile.  The staff are courteous and quick to respond to any issue or request.  Rooms are luxurious and 5-star quality all around, no issues of cleanliness or missing amenities (and if you did need anything, again the staff is on call and eager to assist you).  The Executive Lounge for breakfast, drinks, afternoon tea, or late night snacks is an ornate room with classic and elegant decor.  Located in beautiful Westminster just opposite Buckingham Palace's Royal Mews, fine dining and beautiful sightseeing is just minutes away on foot.  Victoria Station for Underground service is only a short walk as…"
May 2017,High standards maintained!!!,We stayed here again during our 2nd trip to London and had the same quiet room 4109.  The staff anticipated our every need.  The lounge where breakfast is served is great.  The location is very central to call areas of London as fellas walking distance to Victoria station.
May 2017,Favorite Hotel and Staff!,"Hotel 41 is our favorite Hotel ever and everywhere!  Beautiful Boutique Style and the Staff - AMAZING!  This was our second visit and we can't wait to go back.  Perfect location too!!!! We walked to see the changing of the guard, palace and many other tourist attractions.  The food and wine selection is delicious too!  Oh and most important the BED WAS SO COMFY COZY!"
May 2017,Best Hotel and staff ,"Beautiful small hotel with one of the most amazing staffs ever!  They were so responsive, helpful and friendly....like none I have ever encountered before!  We loved the entire experience and will definitely make this our hotel in London!"
May 2017,Amazing Hotel and service,My wife and I just spent a night here for a wedding anniversary and had a wonderful time. All the staff were very helpful and polite. We stayed in the Monarch suite which I highly recommend. Amazing food in an amazing building with great staff. If you are in London this is the place to stay! 
May 2017,Great Hotel in London,"Hotel 41 located in London is a gem in a city with hundreds of highly ranked hotels. This hotel should have a 10 star rating as it trumps most of the big name places. My wife and I were in London for seven days and very happy that we chose Hotel 41. The service, and personal attention that this hotel gives its clients is over the top. The staff was very helpful and always went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of.   Hotel 41 is directly across the street from the Buckingham Palace Royal Mews, and just a short walk away form many other London attractions; Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abby, Big Ben, Houses of Parliament, St. James Park, The Green Park, Trafargar Square, Piccadilly Circus, just to name a few. There are also plenty of restaurants and shopping in the…"
April 2017,I will definitely stay here again,"Stayed here for 5 nights in April 2017 and loved it.  Room was clean, cleverly designed, executive room was really nice and had great food and drink options.  Hotel is well located and has a fantastic atmosphere.  But really, the best thing about this hotel is the staff; I've stayed in a few 5 star hotels before and have often found the attention over-the-top, but the Hotel 41 team offer the perfect level of hospitality  Their staff are intelligent and great at engaging with guests with the right amount of care.  My wife and I joked about Hotel 41 being our new home-away-from-home and I am looking forward to my next visit."
June 2016,A Beautiful Place!,"We stayed here as a splurge for one night in London. It was in the perfect location, central to shops, restaurants, and sites in London.The room was clean, quiet, and comfortable and we couldn't have asked for a better stay."
March 2017,Amazing service ,"Like everyone has alluded to, the service here is simply second to none. From emailing us before our arrival in London to our check out, when we were offered coffee and a bag of treats to bring with us, everything was carefully thought out and seamless. The hotel even gave us some really surprising gifts when they learned that we were celebrating my finishing cancer treatment for the trip. We enjoyed the food at the lounge every evening; it was simply such a classy place to relax after a day. This place was a bit of a splurge for our price range but was definitely worth every cent! "
March 2017,A Definite 5 Star!,"Everything about Hotel 41 was perfection! My husband and I felt like royalty from start to finish. The staff and service were impeccable! The atmosphere was warm and friendly. Each day began with a lovely breakfast and helpful suggestions for making the most of our outings. The staff was extremely knowledgeable. Each evening we returned to our room to find the fire going, candlelight and rose petals!  We wanted to pack up the hotel and staff and transport them to Paris for the next leg of our journey. Hotel 41 is our new favorite place. We are forever spoiled and cannot wait to return!"
February 2017,Impeccable service!,"The hotel is small in size, but the service is second to none. From the moment we arrived at the hotel until our bags were loaded into the taxi after checkout, every staff member went the extra mile to make our stay feel special. The attention to detail that is provided by this hotel was spectacular. I am certain that, next time in London, this is the first hotel I will book for my stay. Besides the service, the hotel is centrally located and accessible to may attractions."
June 2016,Great Experience,We stayed there for 3 nights. My family thought the place was the best. We loved the family atmosphere and the view from the top floor was amazing. The food was also great. We particularly liked the pizza served in the main restaurant.
March 2017,Simply the Best!,Everything from check in to checkout was amazing. Malcolm and his team (especially Andrew and Lauren) made sure that i felt like family and never wanted for anything... a rose on international women's day was a nice touch :) Bottom line is that if you want to be spoiled... stay here!
February 2017,Work trip with a tourist weekend in between,"This property lives up to the hype.  My first impression of the service was excellent.  I flew into London early on a Friday morning.  I had a work meeting and was able to drop my bags at the hotel, use a room to freshen up and change and then proceed to my meeting.  My room and luggage was all set when I returned in the late afternoon.  The service here sets the place apart.  I met my college age son in London for a Chelsea match over the weekend.  The staff put Chelsea jerseys in our room for fun.  Very nice touch!  All of the staff are attentive without being meddling.  The executive lounge is lovely and comfortable.  The rooms and bath facilities are excellent.  I will definitely visit again."
April 2016,Lives up to the hype in every way.,"I've been lucky enough to stay at some amazing hotels in amazing cities all over the world. Offhand, I can't think of any experience that matches a stay at Hotel 41. The level of service is truly impeccable. The rooms are gorgeous. I spent two nights in a two-floor suite, which was deeply luxurious. Looking forward to my next opportunity to stay."
March 2017,Special afternoon tea,"A huge thank you to Flo, Andrew and Lauren for arranging, and allowing me, to bring my friend Diane to celebrate her special birthday. She felt right at home and loved every minute. 41 is unique and goes out its way to accommodate you and fulfil your wishes. My second home!"
March 2017,Superlative,"My wife and I stayed for two nights for her 40th birthday surprise weekend trip away.On arrival we made very welcome and received a complimentary glass of champagne,we were informed about the complimentary treats that are served in the Executive lounge all day long.To make the stay even more spectacular we were upgraded to the Conservatory Suite(pure luxury),if the hotel can make your stay even more remarkable they will endeavour too.Complimentary champagne served for breakfast on the day of my wife's birthday,a birthday cake at night in the room,top restaurant and spa treatment booked by the hotel,it all add's up.Its the small things from getting direction's,seeking advice on excursion's and talking in general they do well.The breakfast's were superb with a wide variety to…"
March 2017,W-O-W!,"What an experience!  The hotel is beautiful, and the location is prime - but what really sets Hotel 41 apart is the staff.  Every single person we encountered had as their prime objective to make sure that our needs were met.  From the welcome meeting and glass of champagne on arrival, to the complimentary canapes with our cocktails (and ever-present array of snacks and treats in the Executive Lounge) -- not to mention the candlelight and rose petals that greeted us when we returned to our room late at night -- we were pampered (OK, spoiled) for our entire stay.  I can't imagine staying anywhere else!!"
February 2017,Top weekend,My wife and I spent the weekend here. Outstanding location and even better staff and food. Nothing was any trouble and all the staff was friendly towards us. Even got a member of staff to come on a run with me. Couldn't of ask for more. 
February 2017,Extraordinary,"Our annual business trip to London turned into to an exceptionally comfortable, low-key and ""warm"" experience thanks to the extraordinary staff and five-star-service every member provided at Hotel 41.   First and foremost, the hotel couldn't be located at a better location for travel as it's located a few quick minutes from Victoria Station. In terms of walking, restaurants and landmarks abound - all within a few quick minutes distance.  We booked a split level suite for our trip and the designed served several purposes. First, we had a separate space downstairs with a cozy couch, warm fireplace and small table - which was replenished daily with a bowl of delicious fresh fruit.  The second level was a spacious bedroom with lovely windows, a large and comfortable bed, and extra…"
November 2016,It's Everything They Say,"My husband and I stayed a few nights at Hotel 41 in early November to celebrate our anniversary.  Given the reviews, hotel website and price, we were expecting nothing less than excellence - and that is what we received.  I think what impressed us the most was how comfortable the hotel and experience was.  There is a thing as being doted on too much and the staff at Hotel 41 know exactly the right balance.  Each night we sat by the fire for at least an hour to wind down, have a drink and think about the day that we had and what was on tap for the next day.  The staff came by to chat a bit but also gave us space to enjoy our evening.  I also think that this hotel, while very expensive, is a good value.  The stay includes the ""plunder the pantry"" and snacks to take on your daily…"
February 2017,Incredible value highly recommended ,"We stay for two day only but we're sure next time we will come back to stay here, room so comfortable with all of facilities you gonna need... Nothing bad to say. Staff very kind on reception they try to speak even in our language.. Was and amazing time hopefully we could come back soon. "
February 2017,2 night anniversary break,"What can i say this hotel is nothing short of perfect, myself and my husband had a 2 night stay to celebrate our wedding anniversary and from the moment we arrived we loved the place. Every member of staff was so friendly which to us made the stay even better. The room was lovely,and the little extras are a delightful surprise. The executive loung where we had breakfast each morning is so relaxing and the breakfast and evening meal we had here was the best I have had in a while. Will definitely be returning."
February 2017,Beyond Excellent ,"I booked this hotel for my mother's birthday as I saw a newspaper article on it a while back. She loves luxury hotels and it can be difficult to impress her, but she told me that it was the best hotel she has ever stayed in.   I booked the king room and it was really nice and spacious and even had a fire place, they left a little birthday cake for her too (it was very tasty) all of the staff are really knowledgable and friendly. My mother loved it so much she wants to go again, maybe I'll book it for her next birthday too. I'll probably get my dad to go with her instead of me as it is a nice hotel for couples.   Thank you for our stay, my mum loved and she wishes TripAdvisor had more than 5 stars. 'Beyond excellent' in her words thanks again. "
February 2017,Simply outstanding.,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for my birthday treat, and a treat it was. The actual hotel is located on the 5th floor of Rubens at the palace. It's a beautiful building with a striking 350 square meter living side wall. As soon as we entered the hotel the  level of service was outstanding. As we sat down at the grand check in desk, in the beautiful executive lounge, it was explained that it is tradition to have a glass of champagne and the only difficult decision was pink or white! After checking in we decided to finish our drink in front of the roaring fire and admired the amazing room. The complimentary snacks on offer are exceptional, sweets, popcorn, chocolate, olives etc and a fridge full of ice cream. Our room was lovely, we opted for an executive king. We had a…"
February 2017,Top notch boutique hotel,"Just stayed for 6 nights. This hotel is all about service. They pamper you from the minute you arrive. I can not say enough about the level of service. I did not want to leave. The staff is great but I must give extra compliments to Adele. A couple of negatives- room 4107 shares a wall with the housekeeping closet. There were loud banging noises at times. This can be somewhat annoying when you want to relax after a long trip or day of sightseeing. It seemed to happen first thing in the morning and throughout the day. With that being said it would absolutely not deter me from coming back. And if you are accustomed to a ""rainshower"" type shower then I would suggest requesting that up front. Our first room had a shower nozzle that was hand held. Not what I'm used to and may not be…"
January 2017,Great location,Its in a good location hotel yeah deffo u can find more cheap hotels around but that one is good we realy enjoyed our stay its a big and very confortable hotel. Theres good staff working here we will be back x
December 2016,Lovely,This hotel was just fantastic! I've never been to a more beautiful place to stay! Everything is so quaint and the staff is just overwhelmingly friendly! Don't make it to London often but when I do you can bet I'll stay here!
January 2017,5* +++,"Best service in a hotel I've experienced. Friendly, efficient, helpful - the list goes on. Faultless. Great room - faultless! Superb location. Welcome reception - superb. Refreshing hot towel & small fruit punch offered. Check out equally as good. Just how a great hotel should be!!"
January 2017,FIRST CLASS - CANNOT RECOMMEND HIGHLY ENOUGH,"My husband and I stayed here on Saturday 21st January, the trip to London to see a show and hotel 41 stay was a Christmas gift from our daughters.  I had seen Hotel 41 reviewed in a newspaper last year as being the Number 1 Hotel in London and I am delighted to have experienced it.  Having stayed in many hotels around the world, this has to be the very top of the list.  We checked in early and were thrilled to be given an ""upgrade"" to a junior suite.  A birthday cake and canapés were awaiting us in the room, what a delightful touch.  The Service and attention to details is an absolute credit to the management and staff.  The hotel has a great ambiance and we can't recommend it highly enough.  We are definitely going to stay here again.  Great work Hotel 41, it was a pleasure and…"
January 2017,Little oasis of calm...with a feel of the ministry of magic!,"From the moment we entered the lobby we were transported into a different world! One where the wellbeing of the customer is a top priority. The staff are so pleasant and friendly without being overbearing or fussy.  The attention to detail is incredible. The room was exquisite and had everything a guest could need (except an emery board...but I'm sure if I had pressed the 'whatever whenever' button one would have magically appeared!) the bed was so comfortable and the room was quiet.  When looking to book this hotel many reviews talk of the free food available...canapés, the pantry, ice-creams and chocolates... but even without all those treats and goodies the place deserves its no.1 status.  The breakfast was excellent too. We even got invited back to the lounge hours after…"
December 2016,best hotel ever,I recently had the pleasure of staying for 2 nights and had a wonderful time. The service was incredible. Easily the best hotel I have ever stayed in and cannot wait to return. Thank you to everyone at 41 for such an amazing experience.
November 2016,A Wonderful Place - Heaven On Earth,"Really good time here, situated well allowing us to spend as much time as we like gawking at Buckingham palace. Would highly recommend a stay here.  The rooms are well kept as was the staff, who were ever so friendly and polite. A lovely place."
January 2017,Long Weekend in London,"Spent two nights at what is quite simply the best hotel I have stayed in anywhere in the world. So what was so special and why will this be our only choice of London hotels in the future. Location - 5 mins walk from Victoria so ideal for all the sights, Selfridges, Harrods etc.  A short walk to Peggy Porschen, Sloane squ and Kings Road.  Welcome - greeted with champagne on arrival. Relaxed in lounge and then escorted to room when ready. Luggage already there ( nice touch).    Room - immaculate. Penhaligons toileteries, Sky channels if you fancied a night in.  Tea lights at turn down and a little circle of rose petals last thing at night. Not forgetting the hot water bottle in bed as well.  Very comfortable bed and pillows and lovely robes for lounging.  Foyer - complimentary hot…"
January 2017,Secret Escape !,"This hotel is a guilty pleasure ! By far the most accommodating hotel you will find so close to Buckingham Palace, The staff go above and beyond to make your stay a memorable experience, nothing is too much trouble, yet it feels so personable almost like a home from home , if you are looking for a secret escape for some R&R with the entertainment that London can iff but a stones throw away this is the one for you."
January 2017,Another great stay at 41,"Just returned from another very enjoyable stay at Hotel 41. We wouldn't think to stay anywhere else in London. Great location, lovely hotel, fantastic staff. Looked after from the moment we arrived, the staff were friendly and professional as always, attending to your every need, providing advice if required. Can't do enough for you.  Super breakfast, breakfast butty and Eggs Benedict this time complimented with a good quality continental buffet. Canapés in the early evening and butler's pantry to satisfy any later hunger.  Look forward to visiting again soon. "
January 2017,Must stay for top luxury experience,"This is a fabulous intimate boutique hotel in a fantastic location, steps from Buckingham Palace and the Victoria tube. Close walking distance to all the posh shops and restaurants as well as the best sites to see.   I can't say enough about the staff and hotel itself. Warm, friendly and they call guests by name as soon as they enter the hotel.  Andrew, the guest experience manager, organized the best restaurants in London for us, and planned every last detail, and room details, including, roses, candles, and an anniversary cake for our anniversary. He's just fantastic!  The room was a king studio decorated perfectly with all the amenities one can imagine. Truly a wonderful experience for those looking for uncompromising quality in the heart of London. I would highly recommend.…"
December 2016,Absolutely excellent place!,"This hotel is a hidden gem.  It is a small hotel located on a main street.  From the minute you walk in you are greeted with a hot chocolate and lots of little treats; sweets, nuts, dried fruit.  In the main lobby there is a buffet cart which is constantly being refilled with a range of snacks from sweets to cold meats to curries.  You could literally stay in the hotel all day and enjoy the range of snacks and treats.  There is also a lovely fireplace which makes sitting in the lounge that bit more special.   The staff are incredible too, nothing is too much trouble.  They are always there to answer any questions or make suggestions.  The rooms are well presented and the bed is very comfortable.   It is an excellent hotel and worth a visit.  It may be a little pricey but all the…"
May 2016,Perfect and Terrific,"If you wanna experience one of the best and terrific London luxury experience you definitely need to go at Hotel 41. Everything is perfect since the first moments and steps you move onto the premises. Excellent service, excellent staff and simply excellent venue right in the middle of the Royal London. You can never be disappointed when booking a stay here. Definitely worth the visit. Priceless."
December 2016,The Best,"Florent and his team have to be the best. The warmest welcome and genuine too; nothing is too much trouble. We choose not to stay anywhere else in London now. We love the attention to detail eg the hot water bottle put in bed for us and fresh fruit in our room. We love ""raid the pantry"" after an evening at the theatre. Why other hotels don't do it is beyond me. The location is perfect. We can't wait for our next visit."
December 2016,There is a reason why we keep coming back! Incredible Hotel!,"This was our third stay at Hotel41.  My thoughts and words that I've written in my previous reviews haven't changed a bit.   It's still simply outstanding!  Without repeating much of what I've written in my two previous reviews it's safe to say that my expectations were once again met and well and truly exceeded. It's just such a unique & exciting experience when staying at this Hotel as you become a friend as opposed to another 'number'. The single level devoted to this Hotel keeps everything nice and simple. The guest focused service though I've rarely experienced at other Hotels of this level.  Flo, Magdalena & Steve Jones all deserve a huge thank you for making our stay yet again one to remember! A truly amazing experience.    You cannot be dissapointed with the level or…"
December 2016,Faultless ,"Intimate without ever being intrusive - a very very special place in the heart of London.   Rooms are immaculate with an exceptional attention to detail that I've only seen at the sister hotel (The Milestone) at this price point. The Library Bar (executive lounge) is a superb place to unwind. However, what really sets 41 apart is the team - absolutely faultless and as a result priceless. The nicest, most genuine and caring people you'll meet - Andrew, Florent, Adele, Lauren and the rest of the team are exceptional people. Beatrice Tollman and family have curated an amazing place and group of people. "
January 2017,My First Stay  at 41.  Excellent!,"Having stayed in sister-hotel-next-door The Rubens a couple of times, 41 beckoned as an interesting and special alternative.  I had been spending the festive season with friends and family in Sussex, on leave from my life abroad.  My last night in UK was to be spent celebrating my sister's birthday in London prior to flying out of Heathrow.   I checked in and had a light lunch by the fire in 41's comfortable and welcoming Executive Lounge, together with the very nice offer of a glass of complimentary champagne .  Resting up for the afternoon in a stylish and carefully designed 5 star room, I found everything to be in good working order, all sparkling and clean.   I returned to the Lounge for a pre-party aperitif with superb canapes and croque monsieur.  I chatted to the…"
August 2016,Classic Style I'd say...would love to return❤️,"Our first visit to London.  Trip Advisor reviews steered us to Hotel 41 to mark our 40th Anniversary.  Was very special indeed.  Our room had a view of the Buckingham Palace Mews (stables).  Small but suitable and a great bath. The ""reception"" area was lovely any time of day..including 3 am when turning your time around.  The young man offered me a pot of tea and we shared conversation.  Upon arrival you are treated to bubbly, but subsequent beverages are on you.  We enjoyed,the breakfast and snacks.  Location is great for seeing the Palace, parks and nice restaurants in Victoria.  For our budget this is a special hotel stay but you desire a nice boutique feel with service....please stay."
November 2016,Most friendly comfortable and luxurious ,"Hotel 41 is our second home in London. We could not ask for more accommodating staff, great location , great atmosphere , comfortable rooms. Perfect. We come back again and again. Breakfast is delicious. If it's not on the menu, they will make it for you. Lots of good restaurant in the area. The staff is excellent in booking restaurant ms for you. "
December 2016,Stunning Hotel & Outstanding Service,"This really is a great hotel very near Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station (District/Circle underground line). The staff are exceptional and cannot do enough to help you regardless of what you need. The rooms are small, but really well decorated and have everything you would expect. The main reception/dinning room is excellent and is a great place to start any evening having a few drinks before heading out. Location wise its great for getting around London and seeing the sites."
December 2016,Royal treatment by psychic staff and Plunder-the-Pantry!,"My wife and I have stayed in many hotels all over the world and, when in London, usually stay at boutique hotels in Mayfair. We had learned of Hotel 41 when staying at a sister hotel, The Chesterfield, where they recommended that we visit Hotel 41 in anticipation of a future visit to London.  Some have been more lavish; however, this is a hotel where the staff carry the day.  The staff-to-guest ratio is probably the highest I have experienced and they seem able to anticipate every need, even communicating guest particulars (eg, activities, questions, preferences) among themselves.  The multinational (and multilingual) staff seemed genuine in their friendliness and sincere in their welcome.  While the hotel is in a fairly busy area, across the street from the Royal Mews, and a…"
January 2017,Most Romantic Anniversary,"We chose to come back from New Year's in Paris to stay in Hotel 41 for our 20th Anniversary and couldn't be happier.  They consistently outdo themselves with every stay.  We were greeted in our upgraded room with an anniversary cake.  That evening, they lit the fireplace and scattered rose petals and lit candles in our room for turndown.  I should also mention that for our dinner, they got us an 8pm reservation in the most romantic room of a restaurant that some wait months to get (and they did it one week before our trip).  I can't rave about this place enough - we refuse to even consider any other hotel in London."
December 2016,Superb service,"Our first Hotel 41 experience was simply wonderful and exceeded what were already very high expectations. It began even before our stay with support and ideas about possible evening entertainment. Our visit began with a warm welcome by the doorman and some hot chocolate and friendly conversation at the ground floor reception, before an effortless, champagne-pampered check-in on the 5th floor and the wonderful surprise of a suite upgrade. We enjoyed a variety of delicious inclusive food and snacks during the day and had a relaxed evening plundering the pantry in front of the fire in the lounge, before a beautiful romantic turndown and a great night's sleep in a surprisingly quiet room. Our stay concluded with the best full english breakfast I've ever had (highlights were the…"
December 2016,Perfection,"Our third time back at Hotel 41 and it was, again, wonderful. From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel so welcome. We were greeted with champagne and although we were very early for check in, the staff still managed to prepare our room, ready for us to settle down straight away. This was our first time staying in a junior suite and it was lovely! We loved the separate living area, the bedroom upstairs and the spacious bathroom. It was sheer perfection.   After fairly busy days in London, it was lovely to come back to the executive lounge and spend our evenings there. We throroughly enjoyed plundering the pantry and sampling the different drinks on offer.   The one thing that made this hotel so special were the staff. They were all so attentive and we liked that they…"
November 2016,Surprise birthday weekend,"We stayed at Hotel 41 last month for one night as a surprise for my husband's birthday. We had a wonderful time - all of the staff are so friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble. I had mentioned when booking why we were coming and we were surprised to find a delicious and beautiful-looking birthday cake waiting in the room when we arrived.   The room itself was comfortable and spacious but the fireplace made it feel very cosy. I had ordered the romantic turndown as a surprise when we got back from dinner which was a lovely extra treat.  All of the food at the hotel was very good - I almost wished I hadn't booked dinner as we were too full to plunder the pantry in the evening! Having told a couple of the staff on arrival that we had tickets the following day to see the…"
December 2016,Speechless... In a good way!,"Amazing stay. Such a quaint place! Customer service and attention to detail could not be faulted at all. My partner proposed to me in the conservatory suite and it couldn't have been more perfect. He had liaised with the hotel staff who he provided a romantic turndown service. We were even brought a ""congratulations"" cake afterwards! Plundering the pantry was awesome and staff were so friendly. I did struggle without a full length mirror in the room, and the pressure of the jacuzzi bath was very variable and fluctuated. Still, I couldn't have asked for a more special place to get engaged. The icing on the cake was the lovely plant that was delivered to our home today from Hotel 41, congratulating us on our engagement. It's thoughtful and personal touches like this that have made…"
December 2016,Short Christmas holiday in London,Our second visit as we just had to return.  Great location to explore central London.  We love the lounge area. Have Steve make you a REAL martini with some great conversation.  This is a very private hotel so very peaceful and elegant.  Not for children in our opinion. When  you finally go to sleep you'll appreciate the wonderful linens and comfortable beds.  great service.   A must try
January 2016,"No better hotel on earth, genuinely!",This Hotel is truly special. The service from the staff is absolutely incredible. They were absolutely amazing from the second we stepped foot in the door to the moment we walked out. You are made to feel like a millionaire and the price of the visit is worth it. Magnificent.
December 2016,Trip ,Amazing trip found this hidden gem the best way by word of mouth. My partner loved it we would definetly return and stay for longer next time. Maybe even a full weekend away with the girls! Great location 
December 2016,Perfection ,"My husband and I stayed at hotel 41 for our 3 year anniversary and we couldn't have asked for a better place to celebrate. Whilst booking they were so helpful allowing us to check in early because we had lunch reservations. Upon arrival they were so friendly and helpful, champagne on check in with nibbles by the fire, so romantic. When we got to our room we had chocolates and a little cake saying 'congratulations' which was so cute. Taxis were all booked for us, they even made sure we had an umbrella because it was raining. The late night buffet was just what we needed after the  Theatre with hot chocolate at the front door too. It was the best place I have ever stayed in. Every customer gets treated like royalty. So caring, generous and helpful. You will not be disappointed…"
December 2016,Superb ,"Thank you hotel 41 for being attentive whilst providing a personal and professional balance of individual needs, all requirements are catered for without being over bearing.  Staff are outstanding, positive and upbeat and enjoy the task of ensuring all guests are comfortable and enjoying your stay with them. My husband had a coughing bout which was noted by a member of staff, Dominic suggested hot water, ginger, honey and lemon to soothe his cough. Which was promptly served to our table, this gesture of utter attentiveness goes towards their guests feeling welcomed and cared for.  One note of criticism, which I have not marked the five star to four as it can improve with a little elbow grease (which I have commented directly to the hotel).  All in all I would suggest if you want…"
October 2016,FAULTLESS!!!!!,"The attention to detail in this property is amazing.  Trust the pictures that you see, it is absolutely amazing here.  The staff, accommodation, everything is completely and utterly brilliant and it can't be praised enough.   Highly recommended. All the staff were exemplary..."
December 2016,Best Hotel ever,Amazing . Could not fault them at all.Hotel was lovely and presented beautifully. Staff were attentive and went out of their way to make you comfortable and really took care of you. Would definitely return for anther stay.
December 2016,Beautiful hotel,"I stayed at this hotel for the 1st time. It's a good solid spot. The rooms are elegant but they have everything you need.  The area is great lots of street art, bars and restaurants, 5 min walk to the subway. The staff are friendly. Stayed December 2016"
December 2016,Absolutely amazing in every way,"This hotel is simply the best!  Its location is incredible, the hotel is beautiful, and the staff is on par with some of the best hotels in the world!    We stayed over New Year's Eve for four nights, and everything was perfect - The check-in process was fast and pleasant (which was appreciated as we had just gotten off a 11 hour red eye flight from Colorado).  The room was immaculate and ready early - all of our special requests were granted, and the concierge was even able to find us premium theater tickets on short notice.  Within an hour of arrial, we were already beyond pleased.  I could go on for paragraphs - the food/snacks in the lounge were amazing, the bar was incredible, the wines were tasty.  Every one of the staff members was fantastic (special kudos to Stephen, who…"
December 2016,New Years Stay,"This was our second stay at this property. We stayed for two nights in a regular room and then three nights in a Junior Suite. What actually sets this hotel apart really isn't the physical rooms, as admittedly they are quirky (and in the case of the regular room, very small) and unique. It is the level of service that is provided here, which is pretty unmatched to any other hotel we have stayed in all over the world.   Case in point, they gave us a free bottle of champagne when we checked in to the regular room, but we did not consume it for a few days. The entire time they replaced the ice in the bucket until we actually opened it on the third day we were there. Also, we are a same-sex couple and when they left slipper bags by our bed, on each side it said ""his"" as opposed to…"
December 2016,Hotel 41 has given me a terrible problem!,"There. That was an attention seeking title, and I'll bet you'll wonder at the 5star rating?  This hotel does service so very well that there are few places that come close, and as a result this means that a search for hotels in other cities can be a trial.   Our most recent visit to 41 was for a weekend in the run-up to Christmas and,boy, did we 'do' London Christmas. 41 provided a calm and serene oasis away from the madness of the capital whilst being attentive enough to meet all our needs.   I am continually impressed by the staff and the lack of staff turnover and how we are greeted by name as returning guests. There are lessons in customer service right there. What they do is not difficult or unique but it is hard to find any other place doing it consistently and therein…"
January 2017,Lovely hotel,"My self and my wife visited hotel 41 for our anniversary the welcome was amazing the staff were so helpful and the hotel was small but very very intimate perfect for us.   We were upgraded which was very nice and a complimentary bottle of champagne was in our room lovely touch, I would have been happy to give 5 stars but the bar service was not up to scratch our cocktails were not well made and on 2 occasions they didn't have basic ingredients for our drinks, this could have been because we stayed just after the New Year which was a bank holiday and maybe they had run out without a chance to replenish.  Great hotel lovely food great staff thanks to everyone."
December 2016,Believe all the accolades about Hotel 41!,"My husband and I, along with our teenage daughters, have stayed at Hotel 41 three times, and each time is a wonderful revelation.  The rooms are lovely, the staff is gracious and helpful, and the hotel is quiet.  We enjoyed delicious complimentary snacks and appetizers in the lounge before seeing a show--the lounge is a wonderful pre-evening or post-evening place to relax.  The staff each time has ensured that our stay in London was outstanding.  If you think the quality of your hotel experience cannot substantially enhance your vacation enjoyment, you have not been to the Hotel 41."
December 2016,"Great Location, Impeccable staff, Incredible service, Superb treats.","Previous to staying here I could not believe the “Excellent Reviews” on tripadvisor for Hotel 41 could be accurate / truthful. WELL THEY ARE ! !  We’re from Lincolnshire,,, We’re cynical,,, We’re sceptical,,, We’re wary,,, We’ve been disillusioned too many times. If we had not witnessed the excellent service, the pristine cleanliness, the friendliness of ALL the staff, the superb decor, the wonderful facilities with numerous delightful  touches for ourselves we would have never believed such a place could exist. I’ve said for long enough there is a need for somewhere like this, well here it is ! ! Even though Hotel 41 is the number 1 hotel for the whole of London on tripadvisor we never encountered one member of staff or other guest who was snooty, intimidating, plain obnoxious…"
October 2016,"I Have Been Ruined By Hotel 41!!  (part 1, for part 2 please see Ashford Castle, Cong Ireland)","For the rest of our lives my husband and I will say 'it's no Hotel 41' every time we visit a hotel/inn. Every other place (except the Ashford Castle, Cong Ireland) now seems ill kept and lacking a personal touch.  While I would theoretically love to visit other properties in London, I don't believe we will ever be able to pass up an opportunity to stay at the 41.  We stayed for 5 nights and I could give many examples of why it is special.  One example is our friends checked in and were asked which newspaper they preferred to receive.  Our friend said 'anything with a crossword puzzle'.  The next morning there was a crossword puzzle book tucked into her paper. So thoughtful! During our stay we saw three regular King rooms and all were different but charming. The 'plunder the…"
December 2016,Almost Overwhelmingly Excellent,"I must confess that 41 represented a bit of an extravagance for us, but my wife and I wanted a special place in London and 41, of course, is at the top of the list, so we called and luckily got a room in this small, elegant, and luxurious hotel. From the start, we were totally impressed by the service. Nicole at reception not only helped us with the booking but also provided travel tips and helped us get situated. Lauren at check-in was friendly and helpful as well, but the highlight was the champagne served during check-in by the most wonderful Steve, master of the opulent lounge area. Our room was smallish but exceptionally well appointed in black and white and 41 all over, a complementary bottle of Roederer Brut Premier awaiting us. The room was spectacular, really, and the…"
February 2016,Luxurious and discreet.,"Our go to hotel in London when we want a quiet stay. The service is flawless from the second you walk in, champagne on entry and free food, drink, ice cream etc for duration of your stay helps make it a memorable one! Its as if the staff are on your shoulder at all times to top your drink up or assist in any request but they manage it without making you feel awkward, almost as if they are invisible until needed! Lounge area is great for a night cap around the fire."
January 2017,Book well in advance. Not a spec of dust,"This hotel is unreal. Everything is posh, clean and clean again. Polished floors, clean windows and friendly staff. Great location, great london prices and definitely a place to unwind by the fire in the big leather chairs with a whiskey and a book. I couldnt fault Hotel 41 "
December 2016,love this place,great rooms and excellent food available throughout the day combined with very helpful staff and extras such as champagne at breakfast and hot water bottles so good we have booked for next year.The executive lounge is a great place to spend a little time and the location of the hotel next to Buckingham Palace is extremely useful
December 2016,Outstanding!,"Stayed for four nights and could not be happier with our choice. Every aspect of the stay was fantastic from the booking through to checkout. To say the service was phenomenal would be an understatement. Each and everyone on the staff at Hotel 41 provided distinctive service with an attention to detail and guest satisfaction. PHENOMENAL is more like it. Highly recommend Hotel 41, especially at the holidays and definitely on New Years Eve!"
December 2016,Excellent,"This hotel is more like a private home with butler service and superb chefs at your service 24/7. Rooms are good and fine but nothing special, apart from comfy beds and all the normal five star attributes, but the thing with 41 is the lobby/library section which really feels like your own living room. I will definitely go back again and again."
December 2016,Love love love!,"Staff was phenomenal! It's not often that you get a hotel with such great service! I was here with my hubby for a week, and I fell in love with it! I will most certainly be back in town to visit! Loved it!"
December 2016,Christmas at Hotel 41,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for  a 3 night stay over Christmas. I can't imagine having more friendly attentive staff throughout the stay who could not have made us feel for more welcome and special throughout our stay.  The rooms and lounge were to a exceptional standard. The food and treats on offer in this lounge are the best I have experienced in executive lounges thought out the uk and overseas. We were more than happy to pay for the drinks in the lounge. The lounge is a real chill out area with lovely snacks and a great chess set. Food at the hotel was amazing, the breakfast hash  browns were to die for and our Christmas Day meal of rib of beef was beautiful. This hotel is a must for anyone wishing to spend a few days in total luxury with such care and attention given from all…"
November 2016,Hotel 41,"A difficult hotel to review without sounding all to gushing.  In the little time I spent at this hotel, unfortunately only a single day and night, has led me to the conclusion that it is without a doubt the single best hotel experience I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.  From the moment we arrived the service is impeccable and it seems that every care has been taken to make your stay as comfortable as poaaible.  The champagne and canapés on arrival and the subsequent food that is lavished upon you at a moment's notice as well as the overall level of service really do leave you with lasting impression of quality and hospitality that is second to nonw.  The rooms from what I saw are finished to a very high standard and toiletries and accoutrements in the room are of a…"
December 2016,Essence of British Luxury and Service,"I cannot say enough about how wonderful the service, food and accommodations were for our pre-Christmas trip to London.  Hotel 41 will be our choice on our next trip unless someone can irrefutably prove to us that there is something better in London - a feat not likely to occur.  Service is simply perfect.  Attention to every detail but without undue imposition. Cleanliness was impeccable - seldom seen at any hotel at any price. Value for the over-the-top experience was frankly a bargain.  This is a 29 room boutique carved out of the larger Rubens Hotel in the same building but this little gem has its own private entrance and elevator that only goes to the 5th floor where this is located.  One common room impressively comfortable for meals and drinks and conversation.  Some…"
November 2016,"I could come to London, never leave Hotel 41 and be happy!","My first stay at Hotel 41 was with my husband on our first trip to London. It was such a delightful experience there was no question where I would stay in London on this trip. This trip was with my daughter (14) and a friend. The hotel arranged a suite to accommodate all of us. The service, food, room and atmosphere were all superb. London was lovely and Hotel 41 'made' the trip for us. The staff was helpful and they knew who we were. Such great care was taken of us. Have tea there, such a treat! Thanks for everything.  "
November 2016,Better than I remembered,"We were torn as to which hotel was our favorite in London, Hotel 41 or Chiltern Firehouse. Unfortunately, my husband and I are still divided. I love both hotels equally, but my husband slightly prefers Hotel 41 because of the incredibly comfortable bed, the complimentary ice cream bar and the best shower in town. That said, I am 50/50 on which I prefer more, but I will say that Hotel 41 is definitely an extraordinary hotel, which I always enjoy staying at."
July 2016,Awesome...,"Stayed at the 41 for 3 nights. The hotel is just amazing. The drinks are a bit $$$, but who cares. No money, no fun!! You can help yourself at the bar 24hr. Never seen this before.  The staff are very friendly and think out of the box. I will return in January to the 41. Keep up the good work."
August 2016,Superb,Amazing g hotel and a real treat. Having only stayed here once I can't wait to try out another room in this stunning hotel. Staff couldn't do any more to be Helpfull! Visually the hotel is just Stunning! 
August 2016,Best Stay Anywhere,"My wife and I took our first trip to London and we stayed at Hotel 41. It was the most pleasant experience we've ever had at a hotel and we certain would recommend staying here. The decor of the hotel is very pleasant and everything worked as expected, but what made this stay wonderful was the staff. Everyone was extraordinarily professional and helpful and went out of their way to make sure our stay was perfect. We'd like to thank Florent, Magdalena, Nicole, Marta, Dominic, Maria, Jonathan, Mathilda, and several others whose names we didn't get for the wonderful experience. It's also conveniently located near Buckingham palace which made it easy to walk to a lot of interesting historical locations and restaurants. It was also easy to get a taxi, bus, or train to any location we…"
November 2016,Second to none!,"Absolutely fabulous hotel and couldn't recommend it more.  Service by the staff from the time of booking throughout our entire stay couldn't have been any more exceptional.  Their attention to detail and making you feel warm, welcomed and valued made this an absolutely unforgettable experience.  This will be our new residence whenever in London."
November 2016,Fab for price I paid ,"Myself and my two daughters came down for a Friday - Sunday stay as a treat For my daughters birthday, staff were friendly , the room was nice  and the service couldn't be knocked at all! the location of the hotel was perfect for anyone after a city stay , and transport was fine ! The only one minor minor issue was the heat of the room and the air con was not working, but the staff were quick to send a fan up to the room which helped matters out strait away! Brilliant all Round and will definitely be using again  A very happy mum! "
June 2016,Amazing hotel,"This hotel definitely enhanced my experience in London. Its design is unparalleled, the service was exemplary, and the dining was truly finest. The location is perfect if you're visiting for the first time.  Will definitely visit again.  "
November 2016,Great great great,Very fantastic  i think i will visit it again and again this hotel is very  elegant  and it make me crazy to visit again and again i advice all to visit  and they will  never regret peace peace peace and love 
November 2016,Outstanding!,"We stayed as a family (with our 2 sons ages 7 and 9) for 4 days from November 3rd - 6th, 2016 to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary. Staying at Hotel 41 literally made our trip. It is in a fantastic location, close to the sights at Buckingham Palace, walking distance to the London Eye, etc. The service was impeccable. The staff knew who we all were upon arrival and made every effort to help us feel at home. We stayed in the Balmoral Suite, which offered the ability for my kids to sleep in an adjoining smaller room. The hotel has an old world charm but offered every amenity we needed. The bed was very comfortable and sheets and towels clean and fluffy.  The lounge was a favorite, we ate there twice a day, breakfast and dinner were delicious and my kids loved ""Plunder the…"
October 2016,fair and nice hotel,"the hotel has a really nice decoration and interior with classic designs and furniture. The rooms are also very cozy, the bed a little too soft though. Reception staff was nice and serviceminded and we had a great stay."
October 2016,Excellent 41,Nice hotel situated in a beautiful place . The hotel having a wonderful management team ...all the staffs are very good even the ground staff also. I really appreciate all of them for making the hotel as heaven . I thank them to give me all the helps ....
October 2016,Hotel 41,"The door in question is on Buckingham Palace Road, next to the Rubens hotel, which Red Carnation also owns. Although it feels separate, 41 occupies the Rubens's former offices on the building's top floor, and a lift from 41's striking black and white lobby whisks you up to its striking black and white bedrooms. Front-facing rooms look down into the Royal Mews opposite – heaven for American guests. The former boardroom of the Rubens is the heart of 41, a mahogany clad ""Executive Lounge"" with conservatory roof, honesty bar and complimentary light buffet 24 hours a day. Black-suited staff hover, with red carnations in their buttonholes."
October 2016,Brilliant - absolutely amazing.,"Sometimes we get to experience something so unique - so special - that it rocks the foundation about what we thought to be true. Such was the case with my recent stay at Hotel 41. While I thought I knew what excellent service and attention to detail were prior to this visit, I now have new definitions for those words as they relate to hotels.  I traveled to London on a special trip with my eight-year old daughter. From the moment we stepped into the lobby, we were treated with care and made to feel as if we were the only guests staying at 41. Staff went out of their way to make my daughter's experience one she will never forget, and were incredibly helpful booking tickets to local attractions and even helped with Eurostar to Paris. The food was fantastic. High Tea was…"
October 2016,Quality!,"Fantastic hotel - 5 star quality and service. I can't say enough about Hotel 41. The staff were outstanding down to the smallest details. Our room was impeccable, truly no complaints. We stayed for 5 nights and thoroughly enjoyed the executive lounge (which really feels like a library/gentleman's club). We had fantastic breakfasts in there every morning with cocktails and snacks in the afternoons and night caps after our evenings out. Highest quality drinks and food - a remarkable home away from home. We will definitely stay here again next time we are in London. The location couldn't be more convenient either. Well done Hotel 41!!!"
June 2016,Great - Comfortable Stay!,"What a Gorgeous Holidays! happy to have found an outstanding discount for this Hotel! at - is.gd/gothotel  The food in general was great, mouthwatering and pleasant! with lots of choices!  Their personnel were very friendly and helpful - throughout the whole stay.  The room was clean, big, and precisely arranged, Good sized bed and big bathroom."
June 2016,Great hotel!,"The staff was very polite, food was fantastic also. All in All I would rate this hotel 5 out of 5 stars! I was with my family, everyone liked the environment, people were friendly. We spent hours in the cozy lounge area. The hotel is tastefully and thoughfully decorated."
October 2016,ONE OF THE BEST BOUTIQUE HOTELS ANYWHERE 5 STAR TO THE MAX,"from the moment you arrive, the friendliness of the staff, the hard wood antique beauty of lobby and room is so magnificent and very british.......hardwoods,etc. the executive lounge was so inviting and the food and and drink were first class in every sense. The staff could not be more accommodating. I could not be more pleased and give this property my highest rating."
September 2016,Perfect honeymoon destination,"I booked a 3 night stay as a surprise for our honeymoon and was dubious about staying at the Hotel 41 as thought that it may be 'over the top' however, everything was absolutely perfect.  As previous reviews had suggested the surroundings are more like a gentlemans club.  On first impression, our room didn't seem very big however this had more I believe to do with the non standard shape, we soon got used to it and it turned out to be fine.  Everything was of the best quality, as you'd expect, for a 5 star hotel, we weren't disappointed.  All members of the team made us feel really special and seemed genuinely interested in us and our plans.  We were 'wowed' on several occasions by special touches including returning to our room one evening to find rose petals and candles.  I…"
September 2016,Perfect !,"People say it doesn't matter where you stay since you don't spend a lot of time in your room when you're on vacation. Staying at the Hotel 41 will change that perspective.  It was such an elegant, yet ""home-like"" atmosphere that we looked forward to our return each day to have a drink, chat with the staff and just sit back and enjoy our time at the hotel. Florent, Andrew and Dominic felt like old friends.  They tended to everything...whether we needed it or not. They anticipated things before you had to ask....really amazing !   Now I know why this is rated the best hotel in London.  I was sad to leave and will definitely return when we visit London again.   Room advise: We booked the Junior suite which has an upstairs and a downstairs.  it was nice to have the extra space but a…"
September 2016,Wonderful!,"Words can't really express how wonderful this hotel is, but I'll try!  We stayed one night before going on the Orient Express to celebrate my aunt/uncle 50th anniversary and our 25th and this was the perfect start to the holiday.  We were surprised and delighted to be upgraded to suites which were amazing, clean and so comfortable and with  lovely anniversary cakes waiting for us.   The decor in this hotel is beautiful and the lounge is elegant yet so relaxed you don't want to leave it.  All the lovely little touches such as the glass of champagne on arrival, the 'plunder the pantry' treats make Hotel 41 special and unique and yet it is somehow a relaxed luxury.  But without a doubt, the staff are the best ever.  The wonderful doorman/concierge, the lovely reception and…"
October 2016,Family celebration,"A huge rush to return to our London home - Hotel 41 - as we prepared for our granddaughter's christening.  Our son flew in from his home abroad and we were reunited in the Executive Lounge, where the team discreetly poured champagne as we happily embraced.  We spent the day catching up with family matters and relaxed royally in the front of the fire with canapes and later Plunder the Pantry laced with Walker Bay - a wonderful white wine - as we chattered.  A good night's rest in perfectly arranged rooms - thank you, housekeeping - followed by a sumptuous breakfast, and we set off for the christening.  Team 41 are beautifully presented -  as well as smiling, helpful and aware of every little thing that could or should be done for guests.  Attention to detail is their creed, and…"
October 2016,Staff goes above and beyond-extraordinary service,"Creature comforts galore-hot water bottle in your turned down bed, candle lit in bathroom, perfect pillows, sheets and duvets, saran wrapped remote controls,  clean relaxing room, plenty of product, beautiful lounge for guests of ""41"" only. Lounge is stunning, quiet, with nice wines, liquors and munchies if you're hungry.   Staff can't do enough for you from start to finish and make it clear they are available to take care of your every need.   Wonderful, comfortable, caring, loving very small boutique hotel that makes you want to come back-really soon"
August 2016,Delightful stay.,"We stayed in the 41 Hotel seven nights in August. The experience was excellent. The hotel's location was ideal for us with easy access to the tube and easy walking distance to restaurants and shopping. The staff and their overall service was wonderful. I generally hold the impression nice hotels in Europe particularly in European cities and especially in London are very, very expensive, however, after taking everything into consideration offered by 41 during our stay I must admit it was a good value and I would not hesitate to book there for our next visit."
October 2016,Fab!,"Amazing hotel!  All staff are very welcoming and helpful. Especially Steve the bartender, very good service and friendly!  Room was lovely and clean. Food was great!  Perfect location. Staff helpful at getting you a round the city.    "
October 2016,Luxury Weekend ,"We chose the 41 hotel based on its tripadvisor status and were definitely not disappointed. An excellent, intimate hotel, with lovely staff.  Make sure to make the most of the executive lounge, the constant supply of delicious food means you really get your money's worth!  The rooms were beautiful too, luxurious and spacious, just right.  Definitely looking forward to coming back!"
October 2016,Absolutely great hotel and extremely friend and helpful staff,"We booked this hotel as a birthday treat for my daughters birthday. When arriving there the hotel is easily missed as there is only one real marker on the street showing its location. That would be my only minor criticism.  On arrival our, we were greeted at the front desk (not the check in desk as this was in the executive lounge on the 5th floor). Our bags were taken to our rooms and we were taken to the lounge. Checkin was complete by an open fireplace with complementary champagne.  Our rooms were exceptional. Ours even had a working fireplace. My wife seemed to be amazed that they even had a hot water bottle for us to use if needed. The rooms were well equipped, and considering we were in the heart of London, the traffic noise was not noticeable. In fact my wife even…"
October 2016,More than  first class ,"My daughter booked  this  hotel for us as a special  treat for my birthday and oh my this is a very special place. I have never experienced service like this. From the moment  we  entered  the  hotel we were welcomed with warmth and smiles and birthday wishes. Our luggage was whisked away from  us and we were escorted by Mitch to the 5th  floor to complete the check in process??? Well I have over the years  stayed in numerous  hotels in London  and  around  the world but never have  I sat in a comfy  chair and been served  a glass of champagne  of my choice whilst completing registration forms woww. A review could never do this hotel justice, from the complimentary food served throughout the day and into the night, that unfortunately we were unable to take advantage of due to a…"
October 2016,Loved our stay here!,This was one of the best hotels that we have stayed at. We felt welcome from the moment we drove up. We were offered a glass of champagne or water or coffee upon arrival.  We requested early check in and our room was ready at 10am when we arrived.  The staff was  friendly and attentive and truly nice people.  The rooms were clean and cozy and had wonderful amenities.  Breakfast was included and plenty to choose from.  Our stay was only for two nights but we loved it so much we didn't want to leave.  We highly recommend it and will be back.
April 2016,Omg where did I just stay!!,The staff here are helping caring and so kind I felt at home once I just stepped in. It's quality of the room are really amazing I fell asleep at once. It's not a lot of money at all for such high quality. It is placed in a good area. If you go to London you have to go her!!!
September 2016,Top hotel,"Stayed at this hotel for a long weekend through a deal on travelzoo,  Executive King at a very good price,  Overlooking a busy street but very quiet inside, Luxury comfort and attentiveness what more can you ask for."
October 2016,Outstanding!!,"My Fiancé (well he is now) and I stayed at Hotel 41 on 27 October and we couldn't have asked for a better experience! The stay was part of my proposal and the staff, particularly Florent, couldn't have been more helpful. In the lead up to the stay they were in communication to get things organised and told him he could contact them 24/7.  The hotel is absolutely amazing, down to all the little details from the champagne on arrival, to contacting the restaurant we were visiting in the evening to confirm our booking, to the little treats left in the room.  When we got back to the room after a celebration dinner our room had been decorated and we had been left a bottle of champagne and a congratulations cake (again organised by the wonderful Florent!).  From the moment you arrive…"
November 2016,Outstanding London Hotel,What makes a stay is the service and support that you receive from the staff. This is the best hotel experience. We stay here often. Wish we had one of these hotels in the states. Great location for tourists. Updated rooms and many extras.
November 2016,What an amazing hotel!,"My husband and I stayed here for our 10th Wedding Anniversary, from the moment we stepped into the building we were made to feel so welcome and special by the excellent staff and beautiful surroundings. Quite honestly I could go on and on about how wonderful this hotel is but to keep it simple- champagne check in /constant supply of complimentary snacks/ lovely rooms/ fantastic staff-friendly, attentive, nothing was too much trouble. For us the feeling that we were somewhere special and yet made to feel so at home, is why we would love to return in the future!  For a bit of perspective we also stayed at the Shangri-La Hotel in The Shard this weekend- this was also a lovely hotel with a beautiful room, fantastic city views and friendly staff. But if you asked my husband or myself…"
November 2016,Wonderful ... but,"This is a special hotel, small and intimate with staff attending to your ever whim.  If you book direct you get  a £50 credit, although I didn't notice till checkout. We stayed with our grown up son and booked two executive king rooms, felt they were on the small side and every surface was taken up with 'information' making it difficult to put your own belongings anywhere, a bit too fussy for us.  The rooms were immaculate and well maintained, the beds comfy and even a hot water bottle at turndown. The 'centre' of the hotel is the executive lounge which doubles as the restaurant, bar, meeting area and check-in.  Food which is included in the tariff is available all day.  It's very pleasant but doesn't provide an intimate area, as at anytime people can be at the desk checking…"
September 2016,Perfect!!!,My husband and I had a great time at the hotel. The young receptionist was very welcoming and our room was huge (London is famous for not offering very big rooms)  The toilet was shiny and fancy. Will definitely ho back!
November 2016,Excellent,"We have had a recent stay at the hotel for my husbands birthday. Lovely 5 star hotel which is conveniently located to see the main visitor attractions. The hotel staff are attentive to your every need with nothing seeming to be any trouble at all. Attention to detail is exquisite and well thought out and executed. Wide choice range for breakfast and snacks.  Our room was big enough for the two of us, was comfortable and clean. We have experienced many a turn down service in different hotels over the years but this one was special so well done.  We will return a gem of a place well done"
November 2016,Hotel 41,"World class 5 Star luxury, white marble floors with black inserts, dark wood doors and accents , beautiful plants and lobby with lavish furniture. The staff is professional and knowledgeable on everything about the hotel and the city. They have restaurants, shops, gym, suites, jr. suites. I had a room it was on par with the size of rooms in US. It had white walls, art work on the walls, fireplace, desk, bar, leather chair, TV, mini bar, comfortable bed and quite. The bathroom was well equipped. If you left your room you could go to the executive lounge. If you left the hotel it was a great location in the city, and it was near the tube. I was overnight only on way to a cruse, will never get another stay, it cost three times what I normally pay."
November 2016,Best hotel ever,Never have I stayed in a better hotel.My husband and I stayed here for our 30th wedding anniversary. From start to finish it was fantastic. Not just a hotel but a huge part of our holiday. Hard to drag ourselves away.  Every little detail has been thought of. Staff are welcoming and friendly. Rooms beautiful.   Real 5 star luxury. We won't be staying anywhere else now  Thank you
May 2016,Luxurious rooms and charming atmosphere :),"Couldn't find a single flaw in this hotel. Absolutely recommend it to anyone. The service was really kind, everything was clean and the food was also great! There is no place for disappointment here! Would visit again."
July 2016,Best hotel in Londn,"This is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. The room was large, stylish and beautifully furnished; we were treated like royalty at breakfast, the service were impeccable; a wonderful location and the well appointed bar encouraged us to stay in hotel. This hotel certainly has the formula right."
September 2016,We miss the Hotel 41!,"We’ve recently returned from our fourth stay at the Hotel 41, this one for 9 nights.  Incredible hotel with wonderful staff. We miss them all so much!    The location right across the Royal Mews and mid-way between Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station is perfect. The hotel itself is beautiful and has the finest amenities. The Executive Lounge is beautiful with gorgeous woodwork, a fireplace and a gorgeous glass skylight. We are casual people and don’t feel at all out of place. At night with the candles lit, the ambiance is perfect. Meals are served here as well as evening canapes and then Plunder the Pantry. This feature alone makes a stay at the Hotel 41 worthwhile! Tasty hot entre, breads, cheeses, seafood, salads and desserts are all part of Plunder. The last evening of our…"
October 2016,What a gem!!,"We booked this hotel as a stop over in London on our way to South Africa and because we really like Red Carnation Hotels. We were not disappointed, the excellence of the facility, staff and location were exactly what we have come to appreciate with this hotel group. The lounge was a delight to be used and savoured with a quality of service without compare. We will be back and keep up the very high standard."
June 2016,nice stay in a exiciting city,We had a nice couple of nights at this hotel me and my wife. Breakfast was served in a nice restaurant with cozy atmosphere and the service overall was really great. Rooms could be bigger and the beds a bit softer.
August 2016,"Beautiful decor, amazing staff","We visited for 2nights back in August, the location is excellent and the rooms were luxurious! The staff were very attentive and helpful, for example when we asked for extra pillows and clean sheets they arrived instantly as if they were waiting outside the door. We will be coming back for sure!"
October 2016,One of the finest hotel experiences in the world,"I have stayed in many 5 star and luxury hotels.  Most were memorable and some quite sublime.  Service is the foundation of any good hotel.  I know that sounds obvious but pulling it off is no easy task.  Hotel 41 does ""service"" unlike any place I have ever stayed in and they do it brilliantly!  The staff is friendly, earnest, funny and attentive to your smallest need.  Their staff is always present and ""in the zone"" when they interact with you.  The smallest detail or request is expertly accommodated.  This place is a gem!"
September 2016,Ultimate comfort and great service.,"We stayed for two nights in September.  The hotel's location is excellent, the staff really do care about their guests.  I, unfortunately, was sick on the day we arrived and was given a room to rest while our room was being prepared for us.  This was the best bed, the best bedding, the best pillows, the best shower and bath.... I could go on.   A real treat for us."
October 2016,A place where luxury & privacy both mainatined,"Hotel 41 became one of my favorites on the first visit. Recently I spent 2 nights 1 day there. The hotel is so luxurious and service is outstanding. My room was clean & tidy and in perfect condition, and staff showed excellent professionalism to detail in preparing for my arrival and in housekeeping services every day. Thank you."
October 2016,Very special place..,"An absolutely fabulous experience.  We recently spent 3 nights at Hotel 41 and it surpassed our expectation in every way.  It's a lovely boutique hotel with very elegant and tasteful rooms, but the best part of our experience was the highly attentive and friendly service. Virtually every member of the staff immediately knew us by name, and bent over backwards to insure that no detail was left to chance.  A truly memorable stay."
July 2016,Needs More to be called the best hotel in London!,"There is not question that 41 offers a lot. You are greeted with a choice of champagnes and pastries My room was lovely and the help tried to be accommodating but the concierge had to go to the internet for information, There is food almost all day included in your room rate,.  But I t is hard to determine when you pay for a cup of tea and when it is included. I knew more than the concierge -  no crossed keys. I was given incorrect opening times and luckily I had another place to go. Nobody opens the door or taxi, and if the person at the desk is on the phone and you have a bag you may have a problem getting in. This is related to the Rubens hotel next door, and frankly that has people who are more knowledgeable about what is going on and how to run a 1st class hotel."
July 2016,Amazing Botique Hotel,"Hotel 41 is a luxurious experience. I highly recommend that you stay here. Wonderful, attentive staff and a great location. The library is beautifully appointed and they attend to your every whim. Get the yogurt for breakfast....it is the best I have ever had."
September 2016,MADE MY BIRTHDAY TOP NOTCH,"I was worried about staying at a Hotel I was not familiar with.  This Hotel was the biggest surprise & delight one could imagine.  The staff knows all about you within minutes,  they want to do everything to please you,  I do not think I will ever stay elsewhere!!! Just absolutely lovely!!!"
August 2016,Memorable stay,Spent 4 nights here recently and all I can say is that the reviews are spot on! The hotel offers immaculate service and products. Truly special and a must-try for those who are on the fence. Highly recommended!!!
September 2016,Can't wait to come back!!,"No wonder this hotel has the accolade of 'the best hotel in London' ! Every single thing , from the champagne on arrival, to the complimentary treats always on offer, is tailored to make your stay here as pleasant as possible. The staff are absolutely fabulous, really genuinely helpful and always smiling and friendly. The room was a good size, comfortable, spotlessly clean with many lovely additions all designed to give maximum comfort and luxury .  Check out the salt beef sandwich in their cafe next door (B Bar) and the cocktails in their sister hotel- Ruebens on the other side ! Loved it and thanks for a fabulous time ! See you very soon 😊"
September 2016,Should be called Hotel #1,"I thoroughly enjoyed every part of my stay at the Hotel 41.  The stay starts with an easy check in, made easier by the champagne being poured while you sit in a comfortable leather chair and get introduced to the hotel and shown to your room. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was adequate. Every night little treats showed up ranging from chocolate to mind quieting pillow spray to recovery eye cream. Nice treats. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful with anything you could ever ask for. Special shout out to Steve Jones who poured our champagne upon arrival and engaged at other times in excellent conversation. Breakfast was always good and sometimes too much food to finish. Great location, just steps from Buckingham Palace. I could go on and on. I would highly…"
September 2016,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,"Hotel 41 was the perfect way to start our honeymoon. We spent 3 nights in London before traveling on. After landing at 7 am after a full day of travel we were greeted with a glass of chilled champagne in the plush lounge. The staff acclimated us to the hotel and services provided. Then, we were shown to the spacious beautiful room. We were thankful it was ready for us so early. Every evening people would gather in the lounge for ""raid the pantry."" It was a wonderful way to wind down from our busy days. We highly recommend this adorable gem of a hotel. "
September 2016,#1 for a Reason,"My wife and I arrived to find out I had a reservation for October!!! we had arrived a month earlier! The team in the hotel didn't turn me back, worked miracles and managed to accommodate us despite my mistake. Everyone was helpful, really friendly and accommodating. We loved the lounge area, like an oasis away from the city hustle. So from a potential disaster - Hotel41 turned this around into a fantastic weekend break. Special Thanks to Adele, Lauren, Mitchel, Florent and all the names I forgot!!! Hope to return soon!"
September 2016,Only one word : perfection,"Perfect from the first step to the end. Downstairs, when arriving, the welcoming is great with fruits and sweets proposals as well as tea and coffee. Very friendly check-in in the lounge with a glass of champagne or tea (with home-made cookies) or whatever. The Executive lounge is within a library with beautiful ancient books and a very cosy wood area. In the afternoon, you have a small buffet with nuts - sweets - drinks - cookies and delicious ice creams. For afternoon tea, perfect warm scones. We were upgraded in a suite and it was perfect (2 levels). Everything was great from the quality of the bed to the coffee and tea set, from plenty of amenities for the bathroom to the welcoming sweets....(one week before our arrival, we received a mail asking us what we like to eat and…"
May 2016,Hotel 41 Lives Up to the Fantastic Reviews,"We chose this hotel based on other Trip Advisor reviews and we weren't disappointed. This hotel is amazing - it's a small hotel with beautiful rooms and the service is top notch. The staff here is professional and attentive.  We started and ended each day in the executive lounge -- this made our stay!  Wonderful breakfast, great snacks, drinks and desert in the evening - it all made for such a great experience.  Yes, the hotel is expensive but its truly worth it.  We had a fantastic time and would love to stay at Hotel 41 again!"
September 2016,Unexpected perfection,"My husband and I just returned from a short trip to London and this time we decided to try a different hotel. We are so happy we did, what a truly five star experience. We love the small boutique feel of this hotel and the staff always went above and beyond (which I can't say always is the case in the U.K.).   The lounge had a very welcoming fell, we had a few meals here and other than the food taking a while to come out, was perfection.   We'll be back!"
September 2016,Probably the best hotel I've ever stayed at,"The entire staff is fantastic. We arrived early and were provided with a courtesy room as our room wasn't ready yet.  No hotel has ever done this for me.  We were also provided a courtesy room after checkout to bridge the timegap until we had to leave for our flight.  Amazing service.   The black/white style is very nice. There are delicious complimentary snacks available all the time.  There were two showers in our Executive King, and they both had ample pressure and heat.  They even had a real door unlike many European showers.  I don't think I'll bother looking for another hotel in London.  If/when we return, we'll be coming back here."
September 2016,"WOW, WOW, WOW what a stay!!","The staff was brilliant and welcoming. Truly engaging at all turns, and made you feel like you were a guest in their personal home. The wonderful ladies at the front desk were so helpful and even assisted with us booking a train to see High Claire castle.  The room was small based on US standards but was adequate and well appointed. The shower and bath pressure were amazing! Like nothing I have ever experienced before. I would also be refreshed after taking a shower! I wish we had that type of pressure in the states.  Location couldn't be beat, two block walk to the tube which takes you everywhere in London. Just an FYI. Also remember to use black cabs vs Uber in London. The black cab drivers have to spend on average 3-4 years studying the areas of London before taking ""the…"
September 2016,Second time ,Second time at 41 and it was just as lovely and service just as attentive   Lots of little touches that make your stay special   Personal unhurried service and calming surroundings   A quality stay and we look forward to a third stay soon 
September 2016,Immaculate Service!!,"From the moment we entered Hotel 41, we were warmly greeted by the hotel staff who are all top notch and will go above & beyond to make sure your stay is nothing less than perfect. Great location. The hotel is located within a short walk of most of the top sights in London. The gem of the hotel is the executive lounge which is great for breakfast, afternoon tea, and drinks in the evening. The lounge has a wide array of food & drinks that are readily available to all guests and are constantly being interchanged throughout the day. The desert selection at night was our personal favorite. Would highly recommend to anyone and we will surely being looking to stay with Hotel 41 again on our next trip to London."
September 2016,Mrs 30th,"Lovely hotel can't fault it, yes it's expensive but worth it, the only thing that annoys me is air con turned right down over night, other than that can't fault the place, when we were out they bought brownies to the room and wrote happy birthday in chocolate, amazing, rooms are very clean "
April 2016,Very special ,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for two nights as part as our trip to the UK. Before we arrived we knew it was going to be special, we received a hand written letter thanking us for our reservation and looking forward to our stay. We live in Sydney! Such a lovely lovely touch.  There is a desk downstairs where you are greeted and you are then taken upstairs via a lift to the main reception area which is also in the dining area. At first this seems a little disjointed however it is just quirky. As you check in you're warmly offered a choice of any drinks soft to a selection of chilled champagne and the service is just continues from there. It's hard to put your finger on what Hotel 41 does differently to other 5 star hotels however it is different. You just know  they've taken a note of…"
September 2016,Best Hotel Experience ever!,"This hotel is amazing.  The location is excellent, the rooms are great but truly the people made the difference.   Everyone, and I mean everyone went over and above to make you welcome.  The staff was amazing. The location is right outside Buckingham Palace and a five minute walk to Victoria station.  Fifteen minute walk to Bond and Regent street.  The breakfast was excellent, and the evening appetizers was well done.  The executive lounge was a great place to relax after a long day. Try the ginger ice cream!  This hotel is well worth it and we will be back.  Thank you for an amazing stay."
September 2016,Celebration of Husbands 60th,"For my husbands 60th I surprised my husband with a trip to London and Paris, with my sister and her bf. I researched hotels/B&Bs/rentals. I read some great reviews of Hotel 41 and booked on Booking.com. Wow!!! What a great find!  The Hotel is next to Buckingham Palace and convenient to many great areas! But, the most important thing....the Hotels Staff was beyond FANTASTIC! They started by making us feel welcome from the start...champagne anyone? When we got to our room...they had a special chocolate cake with Happy 60th Birthday on it waiting for my husband! I didn't ask them to do that....I just indicated we were coming to London to celebrate his 60th. What a wonderful surprise!My husband was floored. The rooms were fantastic and nicely appointed and clean! Spacious and…"
September 2016,"Outstanding service, facility and location.","We had a wonderful time at 41.  The hotel is a beautiful facility, the room was very comfortable, the lounge was convenient and fun but the most outstanding part of all was the excellent service from all the staff.  They really know how to make you feel at home and anticipate your every need."
September 2016,Best ever,The reviews are true. We have never had service like this before - not just excellent but so friendly and totally warm. The breakfast and complimentary food in the pantry are wonderful and everybody knows you by name. We were only there one night - how do they do that! Perfect visit for a birthday surprise. 
October 2015,Brilliant,This place is one of the best hotels in the British Isles. The first thing is the exutive lounge is very comfortable and a good place to have a drink or two. Another thing is this place has a fantastic view of Buckingham Palace. This hotel is more of a private club than a hotel. The conservatory suite is beautiful and a different experience. The romantic turndown was brilliant. The room had a breathtaking view of the Royal mews. The red rose petals were gorgeous. The complentry snacks were great and given out by the best staff in the world. The champagne they gave out was brilliant and I was quite amazed when they offered me it. I will certainly pick the Red Carnatation hotels in the future.
August 2016,"Perfect Location, impeccable staff, incredible service.","We stayed at Hotel 41 for our 5th wedding anniversary.  We have stayed at other luxury London hotels over the years, but on this occasion we wanted to stay in a smaller more intimate luxury hotel.   This hotel is amazing !  The suites are not the size of other luxury hotels but the service more than makes up for this.  The building and rooms are beautiful and well kept.  But it is the staff and the quality of service that makes this place so memorable.  I cannot recommend this hotel enough."
August 2016,Fantastic Hotel,"41 has to be the best hotel I have ever stayed at. The staff will consistently go above and beyond to ensure you have a good stay, and are just generally pleasant. The room was fantastic, the bed was very comfortable and the decor was luxurious without being forced. I opted for the romantic turndown service for our arrival night, which helped turn an otherwise stressful day/commute into a wonderful evening. There were so many little things throughout our stay that just made the weekend perfect, I just cannot recommend this hotel enough. If you're going to stay anywhere in London, make it 41."
December 2015,Victorian,"Bit expensive, but with what you can feel and have there it is absolute cheap... character is like Victorian type..cosy furniture. Good service./.grate food... feel like you staying in a palace. go and stay there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
August 2016,Amazing intimate hotel,"I have never been pampered and catered to as I have been at Hotel 41.  I was traveling alone and they made me feel important and comfortable.  I was greeted by name from the moment I checked in.  The rooms are nice size, tea and snacks really great.   I recommend Hotel 41 without reservation.  "
August 2016,Superb hotel,"My husband and I visited Hotel 41 for 1 night for our 20th anniversary. From the minute we arrived we felt welcome and valued. It really seemed that the staff were happy if we were happy. We had a glass of champagne and some snacks in the lounge upon check-in then we were shown to our room where there was a cake and some small treats waiting for us. Everything about the room felt luxurious. Everything you could possibly need was there; from the toiletries in the bathroom to pens, paper, envelopes, stationery, 2 TV's  and so much more. We went back to the lounge for afternoon tea which was just lovely. Again, the service was impeccable. We went to a show in the evening and were asked if we needed directions, water to take, even an umbrella. When we got back there were candles lit…"
August 2016,Wonderful Hotel!,"We have just returned from 4 wonderful nights at Hotel 41. We chose the hotel purely based on Tripadvisor reviews and we are so glad we did. What a fantastic hotel! It's small just around 20 or so rooms but the service is second to non. From the moment you arrive and are offered a choice of champagnes to celebrate your arrival, the staff really can not do enough for you. Whenever we sat down in the Executive Lounge at any time of the day, immediately there is someone there ready to get you what ever you need. The lounge is a wonderful relaxing space that we enjoyed often during our stay. So tranquil you really can forget you are in the centre of a busy city.  I've stayed at many 5 star hotels but it's really the service that sets Hotel 41 apart. One afternoon Florent the…"
August 2016,The most incredible hotel!,"I chose Hotel 41 as the place to stay in London for my proposal weekend and I have to say that genuinely, I have never stayed at a hotel that delivers such exceptional service. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, everything was perfect. The room has amazing, the food available and served was incredible, the décor, the atmosphere and every single member of staff we spoke to were amazing. It is no surprise that this hotel has such a great reputation. Couldn’t fault anything during our stay and absolutely can’t wait to come back. The attentiveness and passion the staff deliver is out of this world. Thank you so much."
August 2016,Superb!,"Our first time at Hotel 41 we normally use the Savoy however on the back of Trip Adviser I thought we'd have a change for a surprise Anniversary weekend treat, I'm so glad we did. This hotel is superb but the thing that makes it above the rooms or executive lounge or the little things like a coffee or water on your way out is the staff. We cannot fault anyone they were amazing every single one! I honestly felt they were absolutely genuine and were completely interested in what you were or what you had done that day and it just makes the hotel. This is were so many other hotels fall down yes you can have the dazzling interiors etc but do you honestly feel valued every time you come in or leave?!. Simply amazing thank you Hotel 41 for a fantastic stay and we will be back!."
August 2016,Worth every penny! Best hotel I have ever stayed at...,"I have five years experience from a five star hotel, where the level of service was a huge priority. Going the extra mile was rewarded with cash bonuses! Nevertheless, I was immensely impressed by the service offered by the staff at Hotel 41. It always seemed genuine, relaxed and very proactive! Steven Jones and ??? particularly made us feel welcome, but all of the staff delivered excellent service. It is expensive to stay at Hotel 41, but I can vouch for both the food, the beverages, the rooms and the service. You get what you pay for :)"
August 2016,Undoubtedly the best,"We had been eagerly anticipating our stay at Hotel 41 due to the fact that our daughter had stayed there earlier this year and had nothing but the highest praise for the hotel and staff.  We arrived with high expectations but soon realized that those expectations would be exceeded due to the level of service provided by those that work there.  On arrival we were escorted to the 5th floor where we were quickly provided with two glasses of chilled champagne, greatly appreciated when the temperature outside was over 90F.  Check in was seamless and we were soon shown to our room. We were celebrating our silver wedding anniversary and had very kindly been upgraded to a split level suite. The suite was excellent, beautifully decorated and with every amenity you could wish for. There…"
August 2016,Amazing Service ,The service at this hotel is phenomenal with the staff making you feel like a regular from the first minute you arrive. The food and location are also great with the only minor drawback being the small rooms. 
August 2016,Best Hotel in London,"Hotel 41 is by far the best hotel in London! If you are looking for top notch service, a stunning room, excellent staff and amenities this is the hotel to stay at. Right next to Buckingham Palace it boasts pure elegance and is close enough to everything you want to see. I will definitely only being staying here the next time I am in London!"
February 2016,In a different league  !!,It really is a cut above the others that I have visited.  The service is outstanding from start to finish.  Welcomed with free Champagne on check-in ( choose from a menu with all high end bottles on offer ) then showed to the room which had 3 bathroooms. The complimentary pantry is a nice touch in the sitting room  as was the bottle of chilled  champagne awaiting us in the room on our return from an evening out. A special visit to a special hotel.
September 2016,Wonderful anniversary and birthday celebration,"My husband booked a weekend at Hotel 41 for my birthday and our first wedding anniversary celebration. It was magical. The other reviews describe it perfectly - impeccable service, lovely rooms, amazing rooms. The pantry was awesome. The value (I think) is excellent because you get lots of complimentary treats. The Penhaligon toiletries were divine, so much so that I went to the store to buy some the next day. Unfortunately they are made especially for hotels...oh well, looks like I'll have to book another stay! Thanks to all the staff, especially Mitch who was super friendly and always remembered our name."
August 2016,First trip to London,"We chose Hotel 41 for our first trip to London and we couldn't be happier with our decision. This hotel was perfect for our family. The accommodations were impeccable and no detail too small. The employees went out of their way to make each of us feel comfortable and special - every single day for nearly two weeks! Andrew supplied our 11 year old daughter with Dr. Who details. Several staff members enjoyed talking Harry Potter with her on a daily basis. Once we returned home, we missed Stefan's stories as well as Edgar's late night drinks and company. We are still talking about the friends we made at this hotel. It's just that personal. We've never stayed any where quite this special - except for maybe home. "
September 2016,Worthy of It's Number One Rating,"I can't really say a lot more to emphasize this place is perfect as a small hotel.  Elegant, beautiful, outstanding service, great location.  Rooms are gorgeous.  Staff is friendly and fun, much more so than their stuffy competitors, The Connaught and Claridge's.  Entrance is a bit obscure and we had sort of a hassle unloading our rental car in front because of construction cones blocking the front entrance.  Go. Enjoy."
August 2016,The Best Hotel in Town,"For style, service, fine wine, excellent dining, perfect location, comfort, exclusivity and total spoiling of the dogs this hotel can't be beaten.  We will certainly be staying again and can hardly wait."
September 2016,Simply devine,"After a trip around australia with my mum, returned to a new life in London and whilst awaiting our apartment to be ready spoilt ourselves with a stay at 41.  Just spectacular!  The hotel is just beautiful but it is the service that is standout.  A pleasure to be addressed by your first name when coming by staff, attention to detail is amazing.  Rooms are specious and the use of the executive lounge was a bonus.    I will miss my home in Sydney and weekends away in the beautiful HunterValley but with hotels like this nearby- I will certainly be taking some regular  Fabulous London urban getaways at 41.  "
September 2016,Retirement surprise for my wife ,"It's hard to pick out highlights from a 2 night stay that was a continual highlight. Everything was faultless. The level of service was something I hadn't experienced before.  The warmth and friendliness of the staff was outstanding (in particular, Adele and Andrew, and Siobhan and Frank from The Rubens).  If you want to experience the best, stay at Hotel 41.  "
February 2016,Just wow. Live live a star ,This hotel really has it all if you want to feel pampered. Yes it's very expensive I booked in advance and my room was still £350 for a night. However don't let the price put you off. The finishing touches are immaculate and it really feels like being on a movie set. Also the added extras like snacks and so were nice. Staff were very helpful and I didn't come across anyone unwilling to help 
August 2016,Consistently Outstanding ,"This particular trip was unusual in that we had a few minor problems during our stay but so well were they handled, even this  experience merely highlighted how the very high standard of customer engagement by all staff at the hotel set create the type of differentiation that capital investment in the facilities alone cannot create. Florent, one of the front of house team rains a great asset to the hotel."
August 2016,"Stellar Hotel, Stellar Staff","If you are looking for old world charm and service, this is the hotel! #1, it is gorgeous. Black and white flooring and carpet, huge leather chairs, a library which has a buffet bar with lovely finger snacks and amazing  desserts. You will be greeted and have the door opened for you by wonderful staff. You will be treated with champagne upon check-in. Your room will have a lovely fruit tray, every morning and a paper in whatever language you choose.(upon request, which they inquire about upon check-in) There was always a little gift on the bed every day, sometimes a beauty product or a candy of some sort There are candy bowls at the front desk and also water bottles you can take as you head out to see the beautiful city ofLondon. The staff is SO wonderful; they all felt like…"
July 2016,Unadulterated Luxury,"The moment you reach the door of Hotel 41 you know you are in fora luxurious experience. From the warm greetings at the door to the attentive front desk staff on check in everything went really smoothly.  Our room was gorgeous, with deep soft pillows and the comfiest mattress I have ever slept on. The Hotel is only a 5 minute walk to the nearest station and there are lots of amenities close by.  Because we had reservations elsewhere we didn't eat here."
May 2016,Luxury all the way,"The hotel is very luxury with a lot of important details to be in perfect condition in comparison with other good hotels, were we have stayed. They take care of everything so much that you feel that you have to do while youa re there. It is a nice place to visit at least once when visiting London, as the price was quite, although we stayed only two days."
July 2016,Prepare to be stunned!,"Prepare to be stunned indeed, as soon as you enter this extraordinary hotel you will get the wow factor straight away.  Very near Buckingham Palace you yourself feel like royalty in these grand surroundings."
July 2016,Live like a Queen,"Hotel 41 will impress from the moment you are greeted at the door. Stayed here for two amazing nights in London. Make sure you put some time aside to enjoy the executive lounge. The room was perfect, can not fault the hotel and all the staff. Made my stay in London fabulous. Great Location. 8 minutes to the nearest train station. Hop on/off bus stop directly outside hotel. 30 min very easy walk to some great sites. If you have a special occasion or just want to splash some hotel 41 will not disappoint."
August 2016,Welcomed back like old friends,"If you ever need to feel special and have an amazing couple of days away , look no further than hotel 41, set next to Buckingham Palace , in the centre of London , the moment you walk through the doors you are treated and made to feel like a member of the royal family ,   Nothing is too much trouble and from the room cleaners through to the management of Lauren you could never bet made feel more special ,  Steve in charge of the daytime drinks etc is a star explaining how and what goes into your cocktail or letting you know where to eat and drink or socialise in the city,   Thanks again and we will definitely be back ."
August 2016,Wonderful Boutique Hotel,"41 Hotel is right behind Buckingham Palace and it is well situated for walking to any location in Central London. The hotel is small and intimate. As such the staff know you from when you step inside the small lobby. All rooms are on the same floor with a hub called ""The Executive Lounge"". This is the where breakfast is taken, and drinks, snacks are constantly available. The concierge staff are truely wonderful to deal with. Restaurant or tour reservations were made with aplomb."
August 2016,Anniversary delight,"My husband and I spent our 11th anniversary here, while watching the cricket at the Oval.  It was a wonderful stay.  The rooms are spacious and clean, complimentary snacks in the lounge and the staff were second-to-none.  They were highly attentive: addressing us by name, asking about the match, and couldn't do enough for us.  Despite being hard-working, they also took the time to chat and make us feel welcome.  Plenty of friendly banter with Andrew in particular! We would love to come back again soon."
August 2016,Wow!,"My wife and I were staying over two nights in London at the conclusion of a Baltic cruise, and I wanted a nice hotel to enjoy.  Reading reviews on TripAdvisor, I selected Hotel 41.  Best decision I ever made.  This hotel is AMAZING.  Not only is the location perfect (across the street from Buckingham Palace and two blocks from Victoria Station), but the lodgings are exceptional in size and furnishing.  Our room was the largest hotel room we have experienced.  And beautifully furnished in quality fixtures and a lovely black/white palette.  The executive lounge is open 24/7 and provides complimentary snacks, along with breakfast and complimentary evening munchies.  If you want to REALLY enjoy London, include a stay at Hotel 41 on your itinerary.  And the prices are not…"
September 2016,Brief Visit Home 9/4-9/6,"Great and lovely hotel by far the best Britain has to offer. Concierge and hotel staff are wonderfully polite and often greet you, and there isn't a need they won't fulfil. Probably one of the best representations of British hospitality I've ever actually encountered and as a first time visitor here earlier this month I will definitely be back. "
April 2016,Wonderful hotel,This gem is perfect! Small with an unassuming entrance just down the road from Buckingham Palace. The entire visit was enjoyable. Food is amazing and staff outstanding. The even have a list of staff who will exercise with you. Just ask!
July 2016,BEST hotel in the world,"Without a doubt, this is the most incredible hotel I have ever and probably will ever stay. Nothing will ever come close. Florent and the rest of the staff are world class. Absolutely anything you need is taken care of by them. I stayed here for six days with family and they treated us like we were part of theirs. Relaxing in the lounge every night felt like coming home after a long day of touring/shopping. The rooms were gorgeous, and the location cannot be beat. We were so sad to leave. I don't know when I'll be back, but I can't wait! If you're planning a trip to London, look no further!"
September 2016,Simply the best ,"Words cannot begin to describe how amazing this hotel is.  You were greeted after a long flight with a glass of Veuve Clicquot, which pretty much sets the stage for the rest of the stay. There isn't anything staff wouldn't do for you, and They will always do it with a smile. The rooms are impeccable, timeless, contemporary, individualized, and gorgeous all the same time. All the food we had there was delicious. The service was second to none, and they took excellent care of our entire family, including our five-year-old son, whom they made honorary manager. Don't stay anywhere else in London, you will not be disappointed, I have stayed in many 5 star resorts throughout the world and this was honestly our favorite!! Enjoy your time there!"
September 2016,The BEST Hotel ever ,"We have just stayed 3 nights at this wonderful hotel. Traveling with my husband and sister. Her room was ready when we arrived, but ours was not so they put us into a courtesy room where we could freshen up and take a little nap! That was the beginning of 3 days of being spoiled rotten!  The hotel executive lounge is a constant food fest. There are always snacks out in addition to more substantial fare. The staff new our names from the start and by the second morning knew what we liked for breakfast!  Our friends joined us for breakfast one morning and they set us up in a private little room!! Every night there was s little surprise on the pillow and when we got back to the hotel after seeing ""Wicked"" there were Wicked themed cupcakes waiting for us!  The hotel was clean,…"
March 2016,Probably the best experience ever at a small hotel,"This review is a little late since our stay was in March 2016, but I want to do it because I think the hotel deserves the accolades.    My 14 year old son and I stayed here for a week at Easter. I have never felt so safe and so pampered at any hotel. If you want a big hotel with a lot of amenities, don't stay here. If you want a small hotel where everyone knows your name, knows what you like and anticipates your wants/needs, this is the place.   We stayed in a junior suite which has two levels. It's not the most spacious set up (a little too small in the bedroom area) but the room was beautiful nonetheless. The bathroom was huge with a big soaking tub and separate shower. Lots of natural lighting. Beds were super comfortable and the hot water bottle under the sheets when…"
September 2016,A different experience ... In a good way!,"My husband and I stayed at the sister hotel (The Rubens at the Palace) which shares some staff and several walls snd (hidden) doorways. As we often do when traveling, we asked for a tour at a hotel of interest. We were graciously shown around by a charming young man (whose name escapes me) who had the most delicious Scottish accent. (Honestly, he could have been reading a grocery list and I would have been happy!)   The hotel is tiny and was fully booked, but he showed us what he could, and we liked what we saw.   The GM for this hotel is the same as The Rubens, and he and his staff have got game! It's so refreshing to see an operation that knows and cares about what they're doing."
September 2016,A breath of fresh air,"Moved here from another nearby hotel where the welcome wasn't that warm, the room was tiny and the bed uncomfortable  and was needing a lot of love and found this on a price comparison site.  What a difference   Lovely warm welcome, friendly polite staff, spacious room, lots of hot water, nice little touches in the room, a can-do attitude and a great location.   Would thoroughly recommend as it was also a very decent price. Loved it"
September 2016,"If you're looking for a hotel in London, look no further.","This was one of the best hotels I've stayed at worldwide. The location is perfect; 5 min walk to Victoria Station, Buckingham Palace and Green Park. The service is nothing short of amazing. My parents, husband and I felt right at home. My parents don't speak much English, but there's some staff that speak Spanish and those that don't are very patient. My brother occasionally stopped by (stayed at a nearby hotel) and everyone was so kind to him. The hotel is beautiful; decor very British and classic. The rooms are comfortable, skin products are placed every evening on your bed and the toiletries are top-notch. There's complimentary treats all day with yummy food. I don't eat red meat and it was good to see plenty of fish options. One advice: eggs are overpriced. Eat what you can…"
September 2016,Number 1 in the world,"What can I say: brilliant! This is the most beautiful hotel I have ever stayed in. There may not be much real estate but they certainly make up for it with service. Don't get me wrong. The rooms are lovely and roomy. But the service is second to none! Verve on arrival. Daily fruit basket in the room. Snacks all day. Beautiful breakfasts. Free water. Even a lock for my suitcase upon departure. It is the little things that make the stay so much more pleasant, lovely and comfortable. It is worth every dollar. I would like to come back just to stay here."
August 2016,The best hotel experience we have ever had.,"Without a doubt the experience at this hotel was amazing. Not only is the decor of hotel stunning, but the staff is undeniably the most attentive, professional, friendly, well informed staff I have ever encountered while traveling. My husband and I are a bit of what I would call hotel snobs. It is important to us to stay in nice hotels when we travel. I chose this hotel on trip advisor reviews. Specifically, one reviewer wrote, ""just book this hotel now, you won't be disappointed!"" Thank you very much to that reviewer because my experience at this hotel has made my trip to London a amazing! Starting from the door man walking up the block, seeing us exit our taxi with luggage, but due to construction, we were a small distance up the street. He escorted us into the hotel entryway,…"
July 2016,Best kept secret,"I found Hotel 41 after a lot of searching for accommodation in London and I must say I picked the perfect place! Great location, wonderfully presented, friendly and helpful staff with an amazing level of service and attention.  Part of me would like to keep it a secret but my husband and I were so wowed by it that we have been telling everybody what a wonderful hotel it is. The staff really went out of their way to look after us organising theatre tickets, train tickets, late checkouts and even access to a courtesy room on our final day.  It met and exceeded all our expectations and was well worth the money."
July 2016,Loved it!!!,"Best service, perfect rooms!! The hotel itself was beautiful, clean and welcoming. Thank you for making our stay amazing. Me and my husband will be looking forward to be back soon. Best Hotel to stay."
July 2016,Probably the best Hotel we have stayed in,"We kept looking at this Hotel before booking, partly because TripAdvisor had rated it No. 1.  We could not agree more.  Everyone was great to us & our Family.  We had Grandchildren with us, ages 10-13.  They loved the Hotel also & the Executive Lounge where there were free snacks all day!  The Staff was absolutely great & attentive.  If we are back in London, we will be back."
August 2016,Absolutely Stunning.,"When I knew I had business coming up in London I decided to extend the trip and take some extra time to explore the city with my girlfriend (who had never been to Europe.) In order to ensure she had the perfect experience I began to research various accommodations and taking recommendations from friends and colleagues. It became evident very early in the process that Hotel 41 was the perfect location.   The staff contacted us prior to arrival to ensure we would feel as comfortable in our rooms as possible. They were polite, personable and professional (which was a welcome change from feeling like ""just another guest."") Each of the staff members remembered both my name as well as my girlfriends and greeted us each day in passing and at the arrival and departure from the hotel.…"
May 2016,Never been so well looked after,"Have to admit this place was amazing, nothing short of the best place I have ever stayed in. Thank you for making our holiday so special  by looking after us with first class service  always with a smile and we hope to return one day soon. Anyone wanting to stay in London then go no further than here   😊 "
July 2016,Amazing,I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff of this hotel for the warm and care they gave me during my stay her. Rooms are clean and spacious. Its very luxury treatment and luxury style of life. So great experience that will be a memorable time for me.
August 2016,One week of pure joy,"From the time we entered the front of the hotel until the final day's departure, we felt like the staff really tried to make our stay enjoyable.  From the breakfast (which was included with our room) to the assortment of newspapers to the staff continually asking if there was anything that they could do for us, such as offer maps, directions to nearby points of interest. Believe me, there are plenty of points of interest, many within walking distance. One thing that stands out to me is the shower.  There is so much water coming from the shower it feels like someone dumping a bucket of water on your head.  It seems that the hot water comes on immediately and one does not have to wait for it to warm up.  Another thing is that the location is great.  It is only a couple of blocks…"
August 2016,Service beyond expectatoins,"I can not tell you the last time my partner and I were pampered with this amount of quality service. The minute we checked in to the minute we checked out, the service was impeccable. Classy and sophisticated. The staff was friendly, knowledgable and the best in the hospitality industry, they were there to assist at every need. The executive lounge was a treat in itself, a place to relax with a cocktail and a light snack and a place to meet new friends. Our suite accommodations were clean, tastefully decorated, as was the complete hotel. I will certainly choose Red Carnation Hotels in my future travels. As for the location, you couldn't get any closer to the Queen's Buckingham Palace, right across the street. We found it to be centrally located for our travels."
August 2016,A Palace across from the Palace!,"If you are looking for a hotel where you are treated like a King & Queen, you have found it here! My husband and I are returning from a 5 night stay at Hotel 41 and hands down this is the best hotel we have ever experienced. From the 5 star service, staff attentiveness, pristine cleanliness, warm hospitality, and exceptional experience you are looking for Hotel 41 is the Palace across from the Palace. The afternoon tea, evening happy hours, and Belgian waffles at breakfast were an added touch. Just be prepared to make your hotel stay an annual trip, you won't want to leave."
July 2016,Nothing to Improve Upon,"I spent a week at Hotel 41 for vacation and had a magnificent time. Everyone I encountered seemed truly pleased to work there and took great pride in making me feel welcome and accommodated. The staff immediately knew my name and quickly learned my favorite beverage, without being overly-solicitous. The hotel is small but luxurious. My room had a sitting area that was quite comfortable. Breakfast was included so I ate there each morning- never-mind the menu, just ask for what you want and it appears. The lounge area has the feel of a mansion library- wood paneling and elegant furnishings. There are complimentary snacks presented throughout the day culminating in ""plunder the pantry"" which is perfect if you are not up for a heavy supper. Because the hotel is small you see the…"
July 2016,Worth Every Single Penny,"We spent three weeks in Europe, staying at some of the best hotels; All three nights at Hotel 41 was perfect and the highlight of our trip! Apparently 41 is the equivalent of the concierge floor for the adjoining Ruben Hotel, taking up the building's 5th floor with a private entrance on the 1st floor.  The Ruben has rooms on floors 2-4 below the Hotel 41 rooms. The rooms are VERY comfortable, well appointed, and have all the amenities one expects from a fine luxury hotel, although as a comment to management, I would upgrade the quality of the Wifi internet service in this high bandwidth digital age. One of our rooms was the split level conservatory suite which was a gorgeous and unique experience. What distinguishes this hotel from most other luxury hotels was their very…"
June 2016,Best hotel in London,We stayed here for 3 days during our visit to London. We loved everything about it. The stay at 41 was actually part of the London experience and was a destination experience in itself. From the minute we arrived the welcome was genuine and the service exemplary. The welcome champagne was beautifully presented and explained and the check in process a pleasure.  What we got was perfect.  The rooms were beautifully decorated and equipped. This was a small hotel with fantastic staff and excellent service. We didn't want to leave and will certainly return!
June 2016,Hotel 41 is like no other!,"My husband booked our 4 night stay at this hotel through Costco travel.  He booked it and then told me about how special this hotel was going to be for us and our stay in London.  He told me it's just around the corner from Buckingham Palace.  I trusted him and thought, ""right, just around the corner!"" ...well, he was right on both, Hotel 41 was a pleasure and a dream to stay with and Buckingham Palace, the front, is right around the corner.                                                                                                                              Because I had never experienced hotel service like this before, initially I didn't quite understand why we had interaction with 6 hotel staff persons from the moment we first walked into the hotel to the hotel desk and…"
July 2016,A delight,"Ideal location, beautiful hotel, gorgeous room, comfy bed - but it was the whole team of staff who took it to the next level.   Their service and attention to detail is absolutely spot on.  We have stayed in hundreds of hotels, but this is by far the best hotel experience we have had.  Perfect!"
July 2016,A very Special Place to Stay,"I've stayed at Hotel 41 twice now. The first time while on business was such a great experience I had to stay with my wife when we visited London for pleasure.  On this visit we stayed for two nights so that we could attend Wimbledon.  Our welcome was superb. Greeted on the ground floor and directed up to reception where check in had just the right level of formality - a glass of champagne on arrival is also a treat. Having Champagne flow throughout our stay was even better.  Our room was quirky with a lounge with a staircase up to our bedroom.  The bedroom was sumptuous. The bed big, deep and comfortable with great linen. The bathroom was well appointed.  The staff were all attentive, friendly and the service exceptionally good.  The plunder the pantry concept is tremendous.…"
July 2016,24-hr. executive lounge and order- off- the menu breakfasts,5 minutes from victoria station subway stop.  Large well-appointed room.  Sumptuous breakfasts.  Exceptional service from a genuinely friendly staff.  Champagne available 24-hrs. a day.  I would go back without question.  This is the best hotel I have ever stayed in.
January 2016,There is a reason . . .,"this hotel is the finest hotel I have ever stayed at -- service, service, service. When my wife returned, we planned a trip to London and Paris -- no expense was spared.  Even after 4 years, she still talks about her stay at the 41.  From ""raiding the pantry"" to an afternoon reading and sipping Veuve Clicquot in their library.  Truly a one of a kind experience.  Chapeau 41!"
May 2016,Couldn't recommend enough!,We stayed here over the May Bank Holiday weekend and my husband had booked it as a surprise for my 40th. The service and welcome you receive is unparalleled and we were treated as if we were the most important guests in the hotel (I am sure every other guest felt the same). They even left a birthday cake in our room as a surprise - such attention to detail is hard to find and I would urge anyone looking to book a special trip to book Hotel 41.
June 2016,Extraordinary,"My wife and I came to Hotel 41 with high expectations.  We have stayed at virtually every 5 star hotel in London, love several of them, and were curious how a 30 room hotel just down the street from Victoria Station could possibly wind up at the top of Trip Advisor’s list of London hotels year after year.  The answer is service and attention to detail.  Admittedly, the hotel does not have the curbside appeal of the Dorchester, Mandarin Oriental or Claridges, but once you step inside, it really delivers.  The staff knew our names almost immediately, and remembered them for our entire stay.  The Executive Lounge at the center of the hotel serves as check-in desk, bar, and restaurant, and everything they do is wonderful.  The staff will remember your drink order from the previous…"
August 2016,Amazing from start to finish,"My husband and I booked the 'Night to remember' package in honour of our wedding anniversary and birthdays as a romantic break. From the moment we were sat down in the executive lounge with a glass of champagne to register, until we were loaded up with water, sweets and an extra cake to take home and share with our young children when we checked out, the hotel exceeded every expectation.   This hotel has managed hit the nail on the head in every single area. The rooms and lounge are decorated beautifully without being ostentatious, the atmosphere is relaxed even you know you are staying somewhere really special and the staff are extremely attentive without being intrusive. The food in the plunder the pantry was absolutely wonderful, and the extras we got as part of our package…"
December 2015,Fantastic experience,Where do I start this hotel is just incredible from the luxury rooms to the attentive and friendly staff stayed here in December 2015 and wasn't sure what to expect. From the moment we arrived we felt like royalty such a beautiful place with excellent staff that couldn't do enough for us . Champagne on arrival chocolates and cards in our room we where up graded to a junior suite which was beautiful. After spending the evening out we returned to our room to find the fire lit and classical music playing slippers layed out by the bed and night cream on the pillows this place is very special. Throughout the day you can graze on canapés fruit and snacks which are fab all included with your stay we even had hot white chocolate given to us on our way out for a morning walk this hotel…
August 2016,Treated like royalty,"My husband and I are trying to remember a time we've ever been so taken care of.  We've traveled to some of the best hotels all over the world and have yet to find a place that made us feel so over the top luxurious, yet so warm; much like staying in someone's home.  The staff is phenomenal, the rooms and accommodations cozy and chic, and all the treats and food divine.  We cannot wait to return.  We find no other reason to stay anywhere else in London."
August 2016,Boutique Beauty,"If you are looking for awesome customer service, location, impressive decor you are looking in the right place. Our 3 night stay at Hotel 41 delivered all this and then some.  We had a 2 story king bed suite and it was so sophisticated.  This hotel is on the 5th floor of a building attached to another hotel and an excellent restaurant. The Executive Lounge on the 5th floor is bright and warmly decorated just as you would expect of a British living room.  The ""bbar"" restaurant next door has wonderful food, drinks and very cool decor.  Service here was just as great at next door at Hotel 41.  Another great feature is the location, right on the back side of Buckingham Palace.  Nice walking distance to some many pubs and super people watching.  Would definitely recommend this hotel…"
August 2016,"Amazing location, amazing service","If you like a full-service experience, this is your place. Wow. I've never experienced anything like it. They offer service beyond compare: want tea outside of the normal hours? Want your bags packed before you leave? Want your car brought around, gassed up? We didn't test them, but as far as I could tell, there was nothing (legal) this staff wouldn't do. They were so friendly, to us and to our kids--and so ridiculously helpful. Oh, and that afternoon tea is amazing. They even have gluten-free scones. Breakfast buffet wasn't big, but had a wide variety of things. Don't come to this hotel if you are looking for big hotel service (impersonal). This is a relatively small hotel, located on one floor of a building (with an entrance on the street level). Gorgeous interiors.…"
August 2016,THE BEST HOTEL IN LONDON,"My First impression of this hotel is the staff , they will ""WOW"" or more than ""WOW"" you!! Then when you settle in the room the ambience of the room, preparations made for you, welcome gifts, cleanliness, products & everything else in the room are just exceptional. The ""WOW"" service starts from the moment you book this hotel until you leave the hotel. The location of this hotel is very central and walking distance to everywhere. It is a definite that i will come back to this hotel as they are so call ""THE BEST IN LONDON"" in my hotel stay list. It is rather weird that i don't feel sad to leave London but i am sad to leave Hotel 41 during my departure back to Singapore. All travellers out there if you are looking for an accomodation in London this place will ""WOW"" you!    Regards,…"
August 2016,Best of the Boutique Hotels,"This was the first time we brought our teenage girls to Europe and feel Hotel 41 set a high bar for future visits.  The rooms were relatively large with beautifully appointed black and white decor.  Neither room had much of a view (we had interior courtyard rooms), which didn't matter since we were out touring during the day.  What sets this hotel apart from any other we have stayed was the SERVICE!  This hotel should be a template for every other hotel to aspire.  First, there is a front door/lobby that is always locked and requires one to be buzzed in.  It is right across the street from Buckingham palace so the area feels very safe.  The rooms are on the 5th floor, which is the top floor, so you ride the elevator up to be checked in and led to your room.  Since there are no…"
August 2016,Beyond Expectations ,"I knew from previous postings that the service at Hotel 41 was going to be superlative. What I didn't expect was that our experience would be the best three night stay we'd ever had anywhere in the world. We arrived from the US after a long, tedious flight, almost two hours in customs, and a driver from a car service who decided not to wait for us and left us stranded at the airport.  We walked into Hotel 41 tired, cranky and disheveled at about 10:00 am, and immediately everything changed. Our bags were taken for us and we were guided into the executive lounge where we were made to feel as though we were the only guests in the hotel, or at least the only ones who mattered. We were seated in comfortable chairs and immediately offered a choice of four lovely champagnes, including…"
July 2016,"Great hotel, amazing staff","It's not just the comfortable beds, soft linens, fluffy towels, excellent coffee and countless other amenities that make this a great hotel.  It's the remarkable staff.  From the moment we ""checked in"" we were treated to warm, greeting smiles.  Check in isn't what you typically experience in a hotel.  We were escorted to the 5th floor where we sat in comfortable chairs and discussed what we wanted to see and do.  Somewhere during that time a credit card imprint was taken.  We enjoyed champagne and snacks while we planned our activities.  The restaurant recommendations were spot on as was their suggestion that we tour Buckingham Palace.  The staff at the 41 truly enjoy what they do.  We'll be back."
August 2016,"Still Exceptional at ""41""","It was 2 years since we had our first memorable stay at Hotel 41.  Back then we wrote about getting what you paid for...which was a very attentive staff and attention to detail and it being worth the ""splurge"" though you could easily do math to justify it not being that much more expensive than alternatives for what is included.  Today I am writing from my Hotel 41 room before we leave after a short 1 night layover prior to a longer vacation.  This update is even more positive than our 2014 visit.  After 25 years of travel, we had the misfortune of our airline not having our luggage join us on our international flight.  We were facing a 12 day vacation with nothing but the clothes on our back!  Clearly not the way to start a trip.  The 41 team didn't seem to care this was a 1…"
June 2016,Sublime!,I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this hotel :) the staff are brilliant! Their attention to detail is unequalled! They always look after us without us asking.  It's our home away from home always :)
September 2015,Best in London,"We stayed here for 3 days and were amazed by the service, just splash out and do it. Fantastic suite with a very relaxed feel.  Lovely staff that do there very best to look after you. I can only repeat what many others feel and say. If you want to be spoilt, this is the place."
June 2016,Never had this experience!,"Sometimes you just HAVE to have that experience of a lifetime and this is it!  From the moment you walk through the door to the moment you leave; it is 5 star service all the way.  Starbucks delivered upstairs while we unpack; complimentary paper, tea, snacks in the morning, snacks in the evening, jars of candy by the front door, bottles of water.....the list just goes on and on.  The staff never seems to sleep or need it because they are always there smiling and trying to anticipate your every need.  We want to thank Stephan and his staff for a totally memorable experience-and then there was London:)"
June 2016,Great nights sleep,A very comfortable stay with all business needs taken care of quickly and efficiently - many thanks for looking after us and ensuring that all requests and visitors were dealt with discreetly. I highly recommend room service - but be sure to ask for Damien; he was excellent.
June 2016,Suite Time at 41,"Hotel 41 in London remains one of my worldwide favorites and certainly the best in London. Two things set it apart--service and compact luxury.   The hotel is rather small, occupying only the fifth floor of 41 Buckingham Palace Road.  When you arrive, you are greeted at the main floor entrance where you will be directed to the elevator and the Executive Lounge. The library-like lounge serves as the check-in area as well as the dining room and bar. Its warm tones and upholstered furniture make it the perfect place to relax.  41 provides complimentary afternoon snacks and a late night raid-the-pantry spread in the lounge. Each time I stay, the late night snacks seem to get more varied and tastier. Thick-sliced Serrano ham, seared tuna tartar, shrimp cocktail, Stilton cheese,…"
June 2016,Perfection,"The number of hotel beds available in London is overwhelming. I made my choice by ranking hotels (using their websites and reviews) using three parameters. Location. Inclusions (wifi, breakfast, gym). Room comfort (size, noise levels, cleanliness).  Three hotels had equal scores so then I used price to make my final choice - Only two nights, without family, this was a big event! Hotel 41. To begin - welcome emails, invitations to arrange restaurant/show bookings, and a pre-arrival information sheet to personalize my room for my arrival.  To follow - I arrived at 7.30 am after a 33 hour commute. I was greeted with such warmth and a strong coffee and nursed through to a courtesy room to use for as long as I needed however I needed. Bottles of sparkling water were pushed on me,…"
June 2016,An Extremely Lovely Hotel,"There isn't much we can say about this lovely hotel that hasn't been stated many times by other guests.  It truly lived up to and exceeded our expectations.  We want to send a special thank you to Stefan and Patrycja who made us feel like we were staying in someone's home.  They always enquired as to how our days of sightseeing had gone and what they could do to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.  We could not have been made to feel more special.  The plunder the pantry, evening canapés and fresh fruit in our room everyday were delightful. We will definitely be staying with 41 Hotel on our next trip to London."
June 2016,Hotel 41,I cannot say enough about this hotel.  The entire staff was very professional and helpful.  The lobby area is as comfortable as sitting in someone's living room.  The accommodations are excellent.  It a great location within walking distance of many attractions and also close to public transportation.  Would love to stay there again
May 2016,Absolutely Amazing Hotel,"This is by far my favorite hotel. My husband and I first stayed 2001 and my last visit in May was just as enjoyable. The staff is so wonderful and genuinely pleasant.  They go out of their way to see that your stay is the best possible. I have stayed in many hotels around the world and I am always drawn back to 41. This is a different hotel style. Some people prefer the large hotels but this is more like a club floor feeling, which I prefer.  Food and beverage selections are outstanding. I loved just relaxing in the lounge area and chatting with the staff. The rooms are perfect for my needs. My favorite room looks out toward the royal mews.  Location couldn't be better.  Several times I have taken private tours (many good local tour companies) but also used the hop on hop off…"
June 2016,Better service than Buckingham Palace.....,"If you wish to feel like Lord and Lady Grantham, then this is the place for you. Service from another era. Highly recommended.   The gold standard of service and responsiveness against which every other hotel will be judged. Simply could not have been better.   They quietly go about trying to accommodate every wish and whim almost without you realizing it. My wife ordered bacon and got something that looked more like ham (British style bacon.) Before we knew it a quiet concierge had googled bacon and realized there are actually four kinds, British, Streaky, American and Canadian. They promptly brought out American style bacon.   Stephan Otto felt like my personal friend and butler for our one week stay.   I could go on. For the penultimate service experience go to the 41."
May 2016,excellent!!!!!!,"a luxury hotel with confortable modern rooms!!!! The stuff was very helpful and professionals and the location was perfect, close to the sub!The breakfast we had at the hotel was of a very high standard!! Totally perfect!!!!"
June 2016,"Stunning rooms, fantastic service and an experience you will never forget!","We stayed at Hotel 41 as part of our honeymoon in London based on the reviews we read on Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed. We were led up to the executive lounge, the main heart of the hotel. Here we were given a welcoming glass of champagne to sip on whilst the set up of the hotel was explained to us. The lounge is absolutely stunning and feels so comfortable. The hotel has complimentary snacks such as ice cream, sweets, popcorn, crisps. This changes to cheese and meats and even desserts during the evening. The hotel has an honesty bar which sums up the whole feel of the hotel. Guests are trusted to log in a book any drinks they have helped themselves to from the bar. As a guest at this hotel you really do feel at home - just a far more luxurious version of home!  As part…"
May 2016,An exceptional staff and property!,"We stayed at the Hotel 41 for 10 days on our second visit to the UK.   Our experience upon arriving at 10:00 pm to our departure 10 days later at 6:00 am was the absolute best.   The staff, from the concierge, to the executive lounge team, to the management, are amongst the finest we've experienced after traveling throughout Europe.   The staff is very attentive, helpful, engaging (personal touch which is much appreciated while traveling), knowledgeable and most important they are all very warm and genuine.    We stayed in a junior suite and was so pleased with the accommodations.  The historic details in the room, combined with a ""western"" size bathroom and amazing shower were a plus.     The Executive Lounge was open 24 hours and you had a full pantry of treats and drink…"
June 2016,"Charming team,first class accomidations","We were so fortunate to find hotel 41 for our recent trip to London. The room was luxurious,location perfect,and staff totally charming professionals . After an injury occurred they treated us like family. That is only true if your family is really good to you!! We will never stay anywhere else if they have an available room."
June 2016,Hotel that never ceases to amaze ,This is a luxury boutique hotel with rooms in a monochromatic palette. The main social area is the executive lounge.   This hotel is absolutely fabulous in every aspect. You will not regret a stay here and you will want to come back. The personalized service is utterly perfect. 
June 2016,Best in London,"We arrive in this paradise with some of my friends. The Rooms is big and comfortable, clean and with nice art decor. The staff is very help full and nice. We have our best time in London. Fantastic position, very close to the sub way and the tourist attraction. "
May 2016,Reality exceeds expectations!,"We stayed 3 nights at this hotel last week and had a wonderful stay. I picked the hotel because it was ranked #1 and our stay exceeded all expectations. The rooms were wonderfully appointed and we were surprised when we had rose petals on the bed at night without asking.   The location was a perfect base for sight seeing. And the staff was willing to go out of their way to accommodate any request you may have.   The best part of the hotel is the executive lounge. This is a beautiful room that they keep stocked 24/7 with free (and delicious!) food. They even have a small fridge full of ice cream. We came from the USA so we were a little off in our time and ended up at the lounge every night around 2:00 - 3:00 AM. I would like to give special thanks to Ivo, who is the night…"
May 2016,Relaxed and quiet with impeccable service. A real treat.,"A fabulous couple of days at this delightful hotel, where the staff look after you as if you were a special guest in their own home. We were made so welcome without any stuffiness or pretentiousness. The room and lounge were so comfortable and the food delicious. We can't wait to find an excuse to go back!"
May 2016,Superlative. #1 for a reason,"We have traveled to a number of wonderful boutique hotels across the world and I am usually not impressed with the usual offerings of sweets in the lobby, turn-down service, etc...but this hotel is truly OUTSTANDING in customer service and deserves special mention. It is rightfully in my opinion #1 in London on TA for a reason. Why? Because, quite simply, they listened and went above and beyond. You know how you get that red eye flight from the US over to Europe just so you can arrive at some unGodly hour in the morning? We got in at 7:30 am from Raleigh. I always dutifully fill out the ""guest questionnaire"" beforehand and generally expect it to arrive in the trash heap. What I requested was perhaps use of a common bathroom to freshen up a little as I knew our room would not be…"
May 2016,A week in London,"What a great experience! so much to say about a weeks stay in London - the ENTIRE staff at Hotel 41 goes 'above and beyond' to make sure the stay is not only enjoyable but memorable. Breakfasts were soooo good. Book the room/stay to include and you will not be disappointed. While rooms were a bit small our upgraded too room suite, with two bathrooms gave us ample room. We quickly learned we packed too much so lesson learned. Located a block from Buckingham Palace, the Victoria Train/Tube station and within walking distance from restaurants and shopping on the West End make this an ideal location. When in London again, no hesitation on where we will stay!"
June 2016,Impeccable Service!,"Hotel 41 was definitely on of the top hotels on our list.We The hotel is elegant without being stuffy, extremely clean ( and I'm very picky!) and the staff is incredibly accommodating and engaging. We were surprised on our first night upon returning to our room, with candlelight, rose petals, chocolate covered strawberries and champagne in a bucket! Fabulous hotel!!!"
June 2016,Still the best in London,"We made two visits here is June (before and after a week elsewhere in europe) and they are just as fabulous as ever.    The staff is outstanding, helpful in everyway, even in things you could not have thought you needed.  They anticpate every possible need and do such a great job of making you feel at home in this hotel.    The rooms are lovely, comfortable and luxurious throughout.  Breakfast is wonderful -- snacks and canapes in the lounge are decadent!  I always love the relaxing beverage in the lounge after a long day.. and it just feels like home away from home.  thank you for all that you do every time we stay!  We wouldn't stay anywhere else in London."
June 2016,Best Service,"The Best service I have ever experienced, with no One of. I know many people were impressed by Hotel 41's warm, careful, detailed service, So am I throughout our stay. The greatest part happened when our trip ended, we found my whole bunch of keys were left behind in hotel room after 13-hours flight back home, it was a disaster..We call the hotel then received a message that the concierge who saw our keys left on desk put it into one of my stored luggage, and we found it there. You can image how grateful I was."
June 2016,As great as everyone says!!,"My husband and I stayed four nights during our visit to London.  I can't add much to what everyone else has said except that it is all true!!  We loved everything about it.  The only thing I will say is don't let the ""fanciness"" of the hotel intimidate you.  My husband and I are regular, middle-class people who indulged in 41 as a special treat.  I had been worried that we weren't ""classy"" enough to stay here.  I was wrong.  For one thing, what I saw of the other guests suggested that most of them were also regular folks having a special experience.  And the other thing is that the staff is so professional and friendly that they made us feel totally at home and comfortable.  So just do it--you'll be glad you did!!!"
May 2016,Hotel 41 London,"Home away from home. But better. The level of customer service is unsurpassed. Our every need was anticipated and prepared for before requested. In fact, I didn't have to request anything. Everything I could have wanted was presented to me with a smile. I've stayed in many luxury hotels, but Florent, Magda and team at 41 went above and beyond to make the stay exceptional. The stay at 41 was actually part of the London experience and is a destination experience in itself. You and your children will be so spoiled, you'll wish the team could train every hotel's staff around the world."
June 2016,A wonderful stay,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel 41 on 11th June to mark the occasion of our 45th wedding anniversary. If you want modern ""old fashioned"" elegance combined with astonishing levels of service and attention to detail then this is the place to stay. A fantastic experience"
December 2015,17th Wedding anniversary ,"Where do I start? We stayed here 26th December 2015-1st Jan 2016 to celebrate our 17th wedding anniversary. With the help of  Florent, I was able to pull off a total surprise for my husband, it was perfect! We had dinners planned, a trip  to Paris, a visit to the shard, Christmas lights at Kew garden, a football game attended, New Year's Eve celebration watching the fireworks down at the eye. Everything was simply amazing! From the moment we were picked up at the airport, till the moment we had to sadly say goodbye, Everything and everyone were perfect. I could not have wished for a better place to celebrate our wedding anniversary and surprise for my husband. The staff were amazing. The rooms we stayed in were amazing. The fire was lit on an evening, with candles around the…"
June 2016,A hidden Jewel by Buckingham Palace,"Even before we arrived our experience began. An email asking pillow preferences, was there anything we specifically wanted or needed?, meant we had already been able to personalise our stay before arriving.From the minute we arrived the welcome was genuine and the service exemplary. The welcome champagne was beautifully presented and explained and the check in process a pleasure. As a family we had asked for connecting rooms. What we got was perfect. The 2 rooms had a main entrance to the corridor area and as such we could have both the room doors ajar in complete safety. The rooms were beautifully decorated and equipped. It was our 25th wedding anniversary and had requested the romantic turn-down. Candles, rose petals , champagne and other treats were provided whilst we were…"
June 2016,EXCELLENT HOTEL - ALWAYS THE SAME HIGH STANDARDS,"This is the fourth time we have visited this hotel - absolutely love it.  This is a small hotel with fantastic staff who couldn't be more courteous and helpful.  I love the executive lounge, I love the service, I love the hotel and we will certainly return."
June 2016,Great Attention To Detail,The hotel has really got great attention to detail to make sure everything you need is right.  Staff are extremely friendly and courteous and make you feel very welcome.  The food bar and relaxed lounge is a real plus in the heart of busy London.
March 2016,"Beautiful hotel, quite unusual - but a few disappointments!","We stayed here in March, for my husband's 60th birthday, it was a surprise treat for him that I'd been planning since November, so I was very excited when I gave him the details the week before. When you arrive, the area downstairs is quite small and you are taken in the lift up to the 5th floor where, when you exit, you enter the hotel properly and wow what a wonderful place, the lounge area absolutely beautiful with it's conservatory style roof and stunning decor. When we arrived the staff were very friendly and attentive and Adele showed us our room where they'd left petit fours and a lovely chocolate birthday cake for my husband. We stayed in room 4119 for 2 nights, it was beautiful and laid out over 2 floors - very unusual. We had booked the BBar restaurant for the 1st…"
May 2016,Amazing luxury in the heart of London,"Hotel 41 is a wonderful intimate hotel in an excellent location, convenient to everything yet quiet and peaceful. Neither flashy nor loud, Hotel 41 is a perfect refuge with a refined, welcoming atmosphere. Every staff member we encountered was congenial and professional. My room was beautifully decorated and very comfortable; Wi-Fi worked great.  The guest lounge area is the best set up I have found in a luxury boutique hotel, it was lovely and elegant, and we were so impressed by Stefan, the primary host, who was beyond exceptional. My triple cappuccino also awaited me each morning.  After working and walking all day, my colleague and I enjoyed cocktails and snacks each evening in the guest lounge - just divine. Now that we have stayed here, we can't imagine staying anywhere…"
May 2016,"If you want to feel like home, this is the place to be !","We were at the Conservatory Suite under a roof in glass. From you bed you can see the birds fly over...what a lovely experience. But, concretely : the beds are wonderful, the bathroom is spacious with rain shower, regular shower and jacuzzi, there is a separate room to sit and enjoy a drink. Coffee and tea can be made. Breakfast is nice and is being served in a british/south african like lounge room. There is a buffet serving hot and cold dishes that you can plunder for free. Additionally there is ice cream that you can grab and a wide variety of drinks. If you want to be pampered and feel at home in a big city, than this is the place you want to be. Enjoy like we did !"
May 2016,A fantastic find in London,"London is a difficult and expensive place to find a good hotel. Look no further than Hotel 41. Carved out of an old-fashioned hotel across from the Royal Mews, the 41 offers impeccable service, lovely rooms, well-appointed baths, and a family-like staff. The Executive Lounge -- akin to a lobby, but as intimate as a traditional London club -- has comfortable seating, an ongoing supply of food, and a convivial atmosphere.  The perfect place to retreat from the hubbub of the big city, whether you travel for business or pleasure."
May 2016,The BEST,"The hotel is small, but perfect. Rooms are decorated beautifully and have everything you might need. Food and drink is always available in the Executive Lounge which is the perfect place to relax before and after exploring London. The food and drink selection is excellent. The location is great too. The absolute best part of the hotel though is the staff- service is top notch; they are so friendly and helpful, willing to go above and beyond, and delightful to talk to. Hotel 41 is instantly one of my favorite hotels and I've stayed in many! Can't wait to go back!"
June 2015,Great Hotel!,"I have stayed a the hotel a number of times now, the hotel is excellent, clean and tidy, staff were extremely polite and helpful. Highly recommend....  In terms of value for money, this hotel is amazing."
May 2016,exceptional stay,"The hotel is lovely, rooms are comfortable and the staff and atmosphere are excellent.  The hotel provides a cozy lounge for breakfast and for cocktails, It is an absolute pleasure to stay at this hotel."
May 2016,First Visit to London!,"Top Service.  Friendly!   Food Drink always available.  Helpful staff.   I thought the Suite would be fun, but my knee did not like the full staircase from the sitting room to the bedroom. Beautiful treats left out for us each night.  Great cocktails in the Lounge for extra $$.  Champagne Bar next door.  Across from Buckingham Palace.  We easily walked to the Irish Guards' Museum."
May 2016,Very lovely.....,"My wife and I stayed for one night at 41, our first visit here, on a very rare evening away without the children!  Even though it was just a short stay for us it really was the perfect choice for a special and romantic night away.  The staff were all so friendly and attentive but never intrusive.  The service felt very personal and it is clear that the hotel takes great pride in ensuring its guests feel looked after and valued.    The Executive Lounge is a great place to just unwind and chat over a glass or two of something chilled.  It's also really rather fab to return to after a night out with its wonderful choice of complimentary snacks to enjoy before bedtime!  We'd absolutely recommend if like us you want somewhere special, peaceful and romantic."
May 2016,Amazing! Just amazing! ,"Me and my wife came to London for our week holiday and this hotel was recommended to us by a friend. It doesn't make you feel at home, it makes you feel like you don't ever want to return there! Prices are more than reasonable for a room with this kind of quality, always bright and welcoming. The staff makes it all the better. We had an amazing time in this place. It made our holiday so much better. A must go! "
May 2016,Exceptional stay,"Hotel 41 truly is amazing.  It is a lovely boutique hotel with elegant rooms, wonderful linens, outstanding amenities, and the best executive lounge I have ever experienced.  I would have been pleased with just this, but Hotel 41 is so much more as well.  It really did feel like the entire staff wanted to make our stay truly remarkable--and they did not fail!  The staff go out of their way to provide their guests with the highest level of service; nothing is too much trouble.  We asked them to acquire a SIM card for us and it was waiting for us on our arrival--so nice that we didn't need to search out a 3 Store on our own.  Every time we came back to the hotel we were greeted by name.  The breakfasts were delicious. I looked forward to them every morning.  Afternoon tea was…"
May 2016,Magical,"We have stayed in many 5 star hotels across the world, but this little gem in London is by far the best.  From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave (begrudgingly) you are treated like the most important guest they have staying with them.  Our 2 night stay was for the Queens garden party and there were a few things we needed in preparation. My husband wanted a pink buttonhole and a wet shave on the day of the garden party. Not a problem. An appointment was booked for him at Trumpers in Mayfair (along with transport) and his buttonhole was delivered in pristine condition ready for us to leave. Nothing is too much trouble.  The executive lounge is the heart of the hotel and an absolute treat. Stefan and his wonderful stories are not to be missed and he along with all of…"
May 2016,Faultless,"I have never been so enamoured by a hotel. Everything about this hotel was perfect from start to finish. I would love to give feedback for what they could do better next time or went wrong but unfortunately or fortunately depending on how you look at it, I have nothing to say. You will not regret staying here. I will rave about this hotel for a long long time. Staff are pure professional excellence. Every hotel manager from all the hotels I have ever visited need to stay here to understand what 5 star truly means."
September 2015,heaven on earth!,the loveliest  location and  the best service along with finest amenities....It makes for a dream holiday stay. The rooms are well equipped and the bathrooms luxurious.  The central space  serves wonderful breakfast and great cocktails in evening
June 2015,Exceptional stay!,Everything about this hotel is brilliant. The location is perfect across from the Mews and allows for easy access to central London. The service here was truly one of a kind and they did everything they could to ensure every aspect of our stay was the best. The penthouse room is a DREAM!! The glass ceiling both day and night is like nothing you will find again! We cannot wait to go back again! Thank you for making our anniversary stay the best! Side note...there is a lovely Sri Lankan restaurant right around the corner! So good!
May 2016,41 is Number 1. All staff take a bow,"We first stayed here 10 years ago. It was super then and is super now.  This really is a fantastic hotel, with the best team of staff that I have ever come across in any organisation. They really were something from a by-gone era when Britain was renowned for it's service. There were absolutely no ""weak links"", so it would be unfair to single out any individual. I would suggest that the Employee of the Month Award would go to the Team.  Sumptuous surroundings, every last detail taken care of. Everyone went out of their way to make me and my wife feel so very special.  What a shame we could only stay for 1 night as we had to be home for my Mother's 95th birthday. We were down in London for a visit to a Buckingham Palace Garden Party and, although we were catching the train on the…"
May 2016,Home from Home,"The staff and service at Hotel 41 is what makes the stay so enjoyable. As the hotel is quite small all the staff know your name, they remember your plans and then are keen to ensure that you had a good time. Our room was quite small but it had everything you could possibly want and need. The beds are huge and extremely comfortable. The shower was the best power shower I have ever been in! The executive living/dining room is just like a very comfortable, well appointed front room - with free ice cream, hot and cold snacks and a great selection of alcohol available. The service is friendly and unfussy. Location-wise the hotel gets full marks as well, being just 20 mins walk from Piccadilly Circus and 10 minutes from Kensington & Chelsea - and the Queen as your near neighbour! We…"
May 2016,There is a reason,There is a reason to visit again and again and the reason is the very simple fact that this hotel has service so well worked out that you just feel like you are in the hands of a welcoming family. This was our third visit and we were no less well looked after. We had an executive King room and this was more than adequate and very well appointed. The 'pantry' is a marvel and I ate extremely well from it on the Friday night even to the extent of having a beer with my curry. I know I could have been in a curry house doing the very same but the infused service just made this all the nicer. We will be back once again later in the year. Is there anywhere else like this? It doesn't matter because this works just perfectly. 
May 2016,Simply impeccable!,"My husband, daughter, and I stayed for 3 nights at Hotel 41 last week.  Everything about this hotel is IMPECCABLE:  service, location, food and drink, rooms, cleanliness -- I could go on and on.  We had reserved a junior suite but were thrilled to be upgraded to the Balmoral Suite upon arrival.   We received a warm welcome from Adele at check-in where we were provided complimentary glasses of champagne while waiting.  She also graciously made dinner reservations at Café Murano for us while we were checking in.  Our suite was spotlessly clean, beautifully laid out, and supplied with best-in-class amenities.  Even the smallest detail - like a really good hairdryer! - was top-notch.  I can't say enough about the staff.  They are completely professional but so charming and friendly.…"
March 2016,OMG just simply isn't enough to describe this property,"I have traveled a lot in my lifetime and there are no words to truly describe our recent stay (March 2016) at this Hotel.  From the moment we arrived until the moment we left, we were treated like royalty.    I would have to say that the Hotel 41 was the best hotel, ever.  Ever!  Amazing service, amazing location, amazing staff."
July 2015,Simply the best in London,"This is really the best hotel in London. I really enjoyed my room, the staff is simply incredibile!! Super breakfast with all that you need. It's not cheap, but hey, if you want the best just come here and pay IT :-) i will return here very soon. 5 stars "
May 2016,4+1 stars!!,"The worst thing about hotel 41, is that you have to leave!!   Form the moment you walk down the Pall Mall and round the corner, to the hotel you know you're in for a treat... Everyone know's your name and you feel like a celeb! All the staff are kind, lovely, polite and chatty, the snacks are awesome, breakfast is spot on and the room is as classy as it gets! I just wish we could have stayed longer"
March 2016,First class ,I must say that my stay at the Hotel was a very enjoyable one. The staff could not do enough for us. The breakfast was lovely and room more then you can expect. Will be recommending this hotel to all our friends. Thank you so much we will be back one day.
April 2016,Best hotel we have ever stayed in!  A+,"We had the most fabulous and memorable stay at Hotel 41.  It is truly one of the nicest hotel we have ever enjoyed.  The hotel is beautiful with luxurious accommodations, a wonderful intimate executive lounge, and special treats everywhere!  From the moment we arrived, we felt like royalty and as if we were guests in your private home.  We were greeted by name by all the hotel staff and felt extremely comfortable and welcome.  The customer service is wonderful- friendly, warm, and attentive.  Everyone went out of their way to greet us daily, ask us about our day's activities, offer recommendations, and seemed truly interested in getting to know us.  My 12 year old son had the time of his life!  We were celebrating his birthday, and we were welcomed with a special birthday cake,…"
March 2016,Simply superb,"This is a hidden jewel of a hotel situated right next to Buckingham Palace.   We arrived at the hotel and were surprised to find a beautiful but very small entrance. The doorman took us up an elevator and through some wood paneled corridors into a sublime room at he hearth if the hotel where we checked in, had a welcome glass of champagne and were shown to our suite. It reminded me of the journey of Alice into wonderland!  Try staff were lovely, helpful and refreshingly characterful. They replied with s straight face to our request for a taxi with ""I'm afraid we cannot do that sir"", followed a second later with a beaming smile saying ""Of course! Where would you like to go"".  The room the the heart of the hotel served the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had.   I've travelled a lot…"
April 2016,"Boutique pampering, worth the cost","Stayed only 3 nites, wish it was 3 weeks! The hotel is the top floor of the neighboring parter hotel next door, but when you enter you are in a world unto itself. Very plush, more staff than guests. Everything we could want was provided, including last minute show tickets, dining reservations, recommendations, you name it. The food in the common room was excellent, we stopped having late dinners out and just ate there. Staff knows your name and preferences. The room was small but luxe, wonderful bed ad amenities. will def stay there again,"
March 2016,Fabulous hotel,So we were the biggest supporters of the Firmdale boutique hotels which are fabulous but decided to try Hotel 41 as it is highly ranked on Trip advisor! Well it is well deserving of its high ranking! Lovely  hotel! Staff are all fabulous and the rooms are great. In the evening you get back and housekeeping have turned down the room and classical music is playing which is so peaceful and relaxing! When you check in they serve you a glass of champagne!! The lounge area where you can relax with a drink or have a snack is so cosy! They have complimentary snacks throughout the day too. The breakfasts are simply delicious! Highly recommend it!!!
April 2016,Amazing hotel with even more amazing staff,From the moment we stepped into the hotel we were welcomed with open arms.  The staff went over and above to make us feel comfortable and important. It was almost as though they knew what we wanted or needed before we did.  We feel as though we have made new friends and would definitely stay at this beautiful hotel on our next visit to London.
February 2016,Outstanding Service,"This was our second stay at Hotel 41 (previous being January 2015).  Both stays have been outstanding.  The location perfect for central London.  You are within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Parliament, St. James Park and Green Park.   Our room for this stay was a split level suite.  The seating area on the lower level was perfect for reading and relaxing .  The upper level sleeping area as luxurious, cozy and comfortable.  The bathroom was quite large with a heated towel rack adding a nice touch.     I would be remiss if I didn't mention the service and the Executive Lounge.  These two features are what set Hotel 41 apart from others.  Simply put, the staff is outstanding.  They are very helpful from the time you walk in the door until after you…"
March 2016,fit for a queen (or king),"stayed many place in london since 1963--including four seasons--and this tops them all.  hotel ruebens , next door, added a fifth floor, private entrance boutique hotel. we spent a week with our children and grandchildren. it was a real priviledge. adjacent to st. james park, across from buckingham palace, around the corner from #10 downing street--the location was ideal. away from the noise and bustle , but easily accessible anywhere--either through victoria station, always available taxi, or by foot."
March 2016,BEST SERVICE EVER,We spent four nights at Hotel 41 and wished it could have been longer.  Superior service.  The staff remembered our names from day to day and even our preference of drink in the evening.  Everyone there was friendly and helpful.  They truly tried to meet your every need. It is located near Buckingham Palace.
April 2016,Excellent service and beautiful hotel.,"We have just returned from a stay at Hotel 41 and we still haven't stopped talking about it. From the moment we walked in, we thought we were too early to check in and just wanted to drop our bags off, the staff could not do enough for us. A glass of champagne appeared along with a tray of nibbles. By the time we had finished our champagne our room was ready. The room was lovely and had everything in that you could possible need. Lovely toiletries and lots of them. We would like to say a big thank you to Steve Jones , who made sure we had everything we wanted and did so in a really friendly manner. The breakfast , late lunch and all of the ""pantry"" food we ate there was delicious. We are now planning when to return."
April 2016,Only visited!,"I actually only visited this hotel, meeting friends who were staying there. What a gem of a place, I can't believe I have never stayed there. The welcoming feel, staff so attentive ( even thou I was just a visitor). I will defiantly be using this hotel in the future. First rate  class hotel in the heart of London. I look forward to booking soon."
April 2016,Pretty amazing...,"if you've ever visited a stately home or watched something like Downton Abbey and wondered what it was like to live like that - I'm pretty sure a stay at Hotel 41 will give you an idea.  The place is beautiful - the lobby, the corridors, the Lounge and the bedrooms are all decorated to a very high standard.  The level of staff attentiveness is extremely high - whilst everyone was lovely we had more interaction with Andrew, Michael and Steve who were very nice guys.  Whilst reading TripAdvisor reviews indicates that this place is as close to perfection as it is possible to get, there are a few things to bear in mind.   Whilst there is the ability to nibble away to one's hearts content, in actual practice we didn't use this to any great extent - all we had we had from the…"
April 2016,A gem in the heart of London,"Hotel 41 is absolute Gem of a hotel in the heart of London. I can only agree with all previous reviews that have rated this hotel with 5 stars. We stayed just for one night on my wife’s birthday and she was presented with a lovely birthday cake upon arrival in our room, along with our welcome glass of champagne at check-in. Its proximity to Victoria station is ideal especially as a forerunner to any Orient Express or British Pullman trips as you will sample absolute luxury and great service even before you get on the trains! The staff, amenities and ambiance are first class, sadly we didn’t have sufficient time in the hotel during our stay. Next time, and there certainly will be a next time, we will make more time available just to enjoy the hotel! "
April 2016,Magnificent & fabulous stay! Best hotel in England!,"Initially, I picked Hotel 41 due to it's convenient location! But as soon as we arrived at Hotel 41, my son (7 year old) and I feel in love with the hotel straight away - home away home!  The staff was so welcoming and caring towards my son and me (travelling alone). And even organised a complimentary private tour with one of the managers - Andrew- to take us around Buckingham Palace, Green Park and St. James's Park. Again, the next morning took my son to Green Park to play football.  For the rest of the 2 days stay, the hotel staff organised our tours and activities: chauffeur city tour, Musical Concert tickets, London Eye Fast Track ticket and restaurant bookings!  We were spoilt, but at the same time felt very well taken care at a cosmopolitan busy city. Every staff at Hotel…"
January 2016,Faultless perfection,"From start to finish we were looked after and pampered.   This is a small hotel but luxurious, without a doubt.  It should be noted that even the black cabs do not know every hotel in London, so do not be deterred if your taxi driver doesn't know it.  Just ask for The Rubens hotel and then go through the next door lobby, clearly signed for Hotel 41. Welcomed with champagne we decided to sit by the fire in the lounge before heading to our room.  Very restful.  Attended to for any requirements but not smothered.  Once we headed to our room we found our case inside, as promised when it was taken from us at the downstairs lobby reception (before we were escorted to the check in reception).  A bottle of wine was on ice, also as promised.  The bathroom, mini bar and wardrobe were all…"
April 2016,A fantastic hotel!,"This is a really great boutique hotel in the heart of London. The amenities are wonderful, and the staff was so accommodating and nice it was like they were old friends. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. I highly recommend Hotel 41."
April 2016,Absolutely perfect in every way!,"All I can say about this hotel is Wow! We booked the hotel to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary and our stay couldn't have been more perfect! From the minute we arrived and gave our name to the lady at the door to the moment left we felt so relaxed and comfortable at the hotel. The staff are all so friendly and it would be unfair to single anyone out, they all knew who we were and the personal touch is fantastic. The executive lounge is such a lovely place to relax and enjoy a drink and the amazing array of complimentary food throughout the day is superb. We were blown away when we arrived back from our meal and the staff had decorated our room with petals and candles for our anniversary, it was such a lovely personal touch that continued the next morning when we were given…"
April 2016,Unbelievable!,After visiting another Red Carnation group hotel previously we thought we knew what to expect from this visit but we were happy to be surprised way beyond our expectations. I agree with all the positive reviews and I have to say this is the best hotel I have ever been to. The check in was a delight and the champagne a lovely treat. The executive lounge and continuous snacks make it seem like a home away from home and you never go hungry! The staff were incredible and nothing was too much trouble. They were generous with their time and we never had to remember our room number or wait for anything.  The room was extremely comfortable and spacious and there were luxurious toiletries to enjoy. I can 100% recommend this hotel you will not regret your decision to stay here.
April 2016,Truly Outstanding ,"My daughter and I stayed at Hotel 41 for 5 nights this week.  First, let me say, that the quality of the staff here is unmatched.   Everyone was so helpful, friendly and always remembered our names.  Even my 13 year old daughter was impressed (no small feat!).  We loved the lounge in particular.  The location of the property is perfect.  It is central to everywhere you want to visit and very close to Victoria Station.  To give you an idea of the exclusivity of Hotel 41, even the London cabbies need help finding it!!  Side note:  Nathaniel's negroni's should be added to the permanent cocktail menu!!  Cheers.  "
March 2016,My new favourite place to stay in London,"What a find!! Smallest 5 star hotel in London I believe but big in stature and customer service. Staff are all wonderful couldn't possibly single one out. Cocktails, food and snacks  all excellent quality and plenty of them."
April 2016,Just brilliant - believe the reviews!,"This is my first ever review but our trip to Hotel 41 definitely warrants me taking the time to post a review.  We have stayed in many 5 star hotels but this hotel definitely delivers on personal friendly service.  From the moment my husband and I arrived we were greeted with warmth, friendliness and also a complimentary glass of champagne- happy days!  We had booked an Executive King room but to our surprise we were upgraded to the Conservatory Master Suite which was set over 2 levels and was gorgeous.    The Executive Lounge is quaint and very welcoming and we just had to take advantage of the complimentary afternoon tea consisting of warm scones, jam and cream.  The complimentary pantry is well stocked and we were actively encouraged to take whatever we wanted.  After drinks…"
March 2016,Wonderful anniversary stay,"This hotel is just perfect. I cannot think of a single thing that could be improved!  The staff are friendly, efficient and thoughtful but low key. We really enjoyed talking to them. My husband really connected with one of the staff, Steve Jones and thought the world of him.   The Executive Lounge where business is taken care of as well as having meals there was beautiful and so tastefully done.  It became our second home while we were there. We had most of our meals there as it was so convenient and the food was what you expect  in a higher end restaurant.   The location was really handy across from Buckingham Palace. It is a  three minute walk to Victoria station then you can go anywhere in the city on the tube. Taxis are plentiful when needed and the hotel is more than happy…"
March 2016,Perfect,"Wow!!! This hotel is absolutely perfect...where do i start? It has a very good location. And From the minute we entered we already knew that we made the right choice. The hotel is very clean and stylish. We were brought to the lounge area with free food, dessert, drinks and impeccable service from the staff. They made me feel right at home. The staff seem to have this ability to know and deliver all your needs in style and cheer. The bedroom was amazing, we didnt get a suite but the space was more than enough for all our large metal rimowa luggages and carry on luggages. It was very well decorated and the bed was very comfortable. Airconditioner was good and works even in winter i think. Television was fantastic with over 100 channels. For those that sleep in late curtains are…"
April 2016,Mr,"Expectations of a 5 star hotel is already there, hotel 41 deserves them all, environment, design, food everything is superb, but there is one thing what thous it all, The Staff!!!!! Never had such a service in my life. All of you from check in to cleaning congrats💐👊🏼 simply the best If you want a small luxury hotel stay here and I promise you, you will enjoy your stay It feels like family who wants to take care of you I will return to you!!!"
March 2016,"The best hotel in London, and the Planet.","We stayed at the 41 for 8 days, and every day things would get a little better. The staff notices what you like throughout your stay and they start doing it for you. For example, if they notice that you turn the AC on during the night. They start doing it for you.   Another thing that is great about this hotel is the service, and the people. Andrew was an excellent chap. He recommended the best restaurants which we loved. Everyone was so nice and very helpful to us.  Mr. Jones was also great to us as he bought me some Haribo sweets with his own money because he thought I would like them. Tea in the executive lounge was one of the most enjoyable things to do in London.  This hotel is not very expensive, it is small and exclusive and it has great rooms. It beats other hotels which…"
March 2016,Amazing stay for our first wedding anniversary!,"We stayed here for two nights on the 23rd March as part of our 1st wedding anniversary celebrations. I had been wanting to stay here for a while as it is no.1 on tripadvisor, and after staying, we can definitely see why it is no.1!   Like so many others have said, the service is simply outstanding. All the staff were brilliant, for example, on check in, they knew our names, loved the handwritten welcome card in the room, I had a gift for my husband delivered to the hotel directly as it would not arrived in time otherwise, and the staff had safely kept it until our arrival...they remembered what type of coffee and tea we prefer at breakfast...anytime we asked for something in our room, they delivered it so promptly...helping me locate our uber taxi as I couldn't figure out the…"
March 2016,Best Service Ever,"Recently stayed for three nights.  While the rooms are nice, what really separates this place is the service, which is the best I've ever experienced at a hotel.  The staff strikes a terrific balance of being friendly and attentive without being intrusive.  The lounge (called the Executive Room) is also a wonderful feature, much like having your own Club in London.  Will definitely stay again."
March 2016,Amazing start to the honeymoon!!! ,"We do not know where to begin.  There's not enough words to describe the service and hospitality we have received.  We checked in after a very early start to day absolutely shattered after a long wedding weekend! We were both keen to begin our most awaited honeymoon.   The staff knew who we were as soon as we walked they greeted us and knew that we were newly weds! The personal service this hotel and it's staff provide is out of this world! Walking in to the hotel, or walking in for breakfast there is always a smile to greet you as well as the staff addressing you personally by your name.  Staff are always on hand - no request seems to big for them!   The two nights we spent there was a surpise for my new wife...she thought she was going to a Holiday Inn for two nights! The…"
March 2016,Nothing but quality ,"Booked this hotel for my partner birthday last weekend. The hotel was pure quality with top quality fittings and fixtures. The bedding was soft as were the towels and the wonderful bathrobe. The bedroom had sparkling champagne, chocolates etc which was a wonderful touch. On arrival were were given champagne and nibbles. The hotel was ideally located for exploring and very close to the palace. Staff were very well presented and all very polite. We would certainly stay here again. "
June 2015,Perfection,"Great location for hotel it was very very good in it we spent a great time there saff if the hotel was very kind and happy. Clean rooms, its not expensive a lot, it was awesome in any look . i would visit it again"
March 2016,Pampered in London,Hotel 41 is a small boutique hotel in the heart of London. We had a delightful 3-day stay. The staff was incredibly helpful and the amenities are superb. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious. Fireplace in the bedroom was lit when we came in one day: a welcomed treat after a long walk on a cold day.  Laurent at the reception was very attentive and knowledgeable about the city. We will definitely be back.
March 2016,"Perfect, we'll be back..","I booked Hotel 41 for my husbands 50th birthday based on the reviews.  Having stayed in some of the best hotels around the world with his job, I thought staying in a boutique hotel was a bit of a gamble but I needn't have worried.  The customer service surpasses any expectation, the staff are all working hard to ensure you have a great stay.  From the champagne greeting and birthday cake in the room to returning to your room at night to find scattered rose petals, candles lit, fire on, water bottle warming the bed and a little beautifully wrapped treat - there was nothing to be critical about as you will be made to feel like a VIP rather than one of many guests in a larger, bustling hotel.  Visitors to Hotel 41 will have a memorable stay and we shall certainly be returning."
March 2016,Wonderful stay in the heart of the City,"Upon arrival we were given champagne and Canapés, and sweets and nuts, the staff were absolutely fabulous couldn't do enough for you and offered us a room upgrade, which was a lovely surprise and far exceeded the room we had at Claridges last year. We were staying for our daughters graduation, and we came back with our sons and her afterwards to celebrate with a few drinks, and we all enjoyed the tasty food and snacks provided free to all guests. We have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world and this is one of the best, and next time we are visiting our sons we hope to return and stay."
March 2016,Hidden Gem in the heart of London,"This 5 star boutique hotel is a real gem, from the moment of arrival until after check out the staff of the hotel make effort to make you feel special. Addressing you always by your name and checking that everything is OK at every opportunity. Arrive hungry and thirsty as the staff take delight in feeding you with tasty snacks and to pour as much complimentary champagne and other drinks as they can. The executive lounge that forms the centre piece of the hotel reminds you of the library of Henry Higgens from ""My Fair Lady"", it is a beautiful room, spacious, simply stunning with plenty of chesterfield chairs and couches. The bedroom,(I was upgraded upon arrival), comprised of a small lounge leading to a staircase to a second floor bedroom and bathroom. The room was full of…"
March 2016,Perfect Stay...,"Cute, english style, little 20 room boutique, greeted with a friendly staff, easy to check in totally professional. First class hotel there isn't anything negative about hotel 41 it deserved 5 plus stars. Great location for walking everywhere or on the tube, and no problems couldn't stop the staff from assisting and making it happen for me. will stay there again 100 percent."
March 2016,A real jewel in the city,"I’ve travelled to London many times and stayed at a good few 5 star hotels in the city, but I have to say, the experience my wife and I had at Hotel 41 was really amazing and unforgettable. The staff; from meeting us at entrance, to the welcome at reception and check-in, to the staff serving us in the pantry area was just truly world class. It would be difficult to name just one individual. The upgrade was unexpected, but really and truly appreciated. I could go on for a while, the attention to detail in the rooms, in the lounge area and the breakfast buffet was incredible.  Thank you to you and your staff for making our stay so special."
December 2015,Christmas celebration,"Stayed for three days over Christmas with wife and Louis (the dog). Bit worried about lack of parking, but on arrival a space was found for us at rear of hotel, free over holiday period. Easy check in with Louis getting most attention....Lovely room with view over Buckingham Palace Mews. Dog given own bed and treats. Good breakfast in library. Light snacks available in evening. Louis always got his mineral water first when going to bar for a drink, how's that for service. Drank in the Rubens Hotel bar, attached to 41, bit more lively. Overall had an excellent stay, lovely staff, will be going back. Deserves its ranking...."
February 2016,Nearly perfect,"One of the nicest hotels I've had the pleasure of staying at. Staff could not have been more helpful, including trying to find a dentist at 2am. The executive lounge was an unexpected gem. The only area that could improve was the standard of food on the dinner menu, not matching the excellence of the breakfast. would still be our number one choice of hotels in London though"
May 2015,Excellent for Buckingham Palace atea,A haven close to train station.  Chose to stay here because of the connection to Orient Express departure.  Room and facilities were five star.  No view at all though so if that is important to you stay elsewhere.  Review against other five stars as I'm not convinced of value for money.  
January 2016,Why is it number 1?! ,"If like us you're wondering why is Hotel 41 number 1 in London, this post is for you. For a small and intimate hotel this really does set the standard pretty damn high.  Before I get into the details, what I will say is that if you like a pompous atmosphere then you're better off going to the Dorchester or similar.   Here at 41 people will speak to you, people will try and get to know you, to me that is the best part. Everyone is friendly, chats to you, gets to know you and adjust how they approach you and/or set out how to make your stay special, after all, everyone is unique.   For us, it was a birthday treat for my fiancée, on arrival they had made it very personal and special, as soon as we pulled up they whisked our car away and parked it for us and gave us some champagne.…"
February 2016,NUMBER 1 HOTEL... FOR A REASON...,Here it goes... Long story short... My husband surprised me with a visit to his hotel. Didn't know much about it. It was to celebrate our 15th year Anniversary together. Literally from the moment you walk in you have entered a whole different experience. Once you have spoken to the lovely people on reception you are greeted by more staff to take you upstairs where you are sat down by who I presume is the manager. The champagne starts flowing and the staff cannot seem to help you enough! Then the best part of the whole experience for myself and my husband was being directed and shown to your room. We walked in and was blown away. We had a guided tour of what turned out to be the Conservatory Suite which we was upgraded too. Our champagne was already in our room and there was a…
February 2016,Valentine's weekend ,Fabulous hotel and services impeccable great few days . The hotel is in a great location for all things a tourist would be looking for we walked to most places . The hotel is very quite unlike the larger hotels and every member of staff is so helpfull and friendly and the rooms are immaculately clean .
February 2016,Get me out of here!,"Ok, so there is no point me talking about all the wonderful things in this hotel as all the other reviews cover these aspects in great detail.  There is no denying the good points- champagne, lounge, food, beds, showers etc.  However, if you are not used to such lavish luxury think carefully before booking here because the reality of it is somewhat uncomfortable.  Although the staff appear friendly, the conversations are so scripted, at times I really didn't think they were interested in our answers and to be honest, who can blame them...guests really aren't that interesting considering they all probably do the same thing.  When I tried to go back into the hotel in the afternoon I was asked in a rather abrupt way if I needed help. I obviously didn't look like the type of person…"
February 2016,Wow Amazing Amazing Amazing 5* Hotel,"Just returned from a fabulous 3 night stay at this top class hotel to celebrate my husband's 60th Birthday.  Customer service is outstanding, the best we have ever received in a UK hotel. Every single member of staff is truly wonderful, friendly & nothing is too much trouble. Our suite was lovely & very clean. The food is amazing/delicious. We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Thank you again for a very special stay. Look forward to returning at the earliest opportunity."
February 2016,I expect the best hotel in the world...,"Read the other reviews and you'll see the kind of things to expect whilst staying at 41.  Perfect Service Delicious Food Extremely Clean rooms  Nothing is too much trouble and at no point during the stay did any members of staff say ""no that's not possible"" or ""sorry, we can't do that"". The staff do absolutely everything in their power to make your stay perfect. Which I'm pleased to say, they did.  Outstanding."
February 2016,I cannot recommend this hotel enough,"We've just begrudgingly left Hotel 41 and its all round wonderfulness! There's a reason this hotel is no.1.   From the great location to the gorgeous rooms to the simply fabulous staff, everything about this hotel is just sublime. Every single member of staff is an asset to the hotel and the impeccable service it offers.   We stayed here as it was a special trip for my parents and the hotel went out of its way to make them (and me and my husband!) feel extremely special.   The relaxing lounge and the never ending supply of delicious snacks is such that you basically want to spend all day and night in there. The way the team remember who you are and what your preferences are, etc. is the cherry on top.  I could go on and on about how fantastic this place is. All high end hotels…"
January 2016,Outstanding,We recently stayed at 41 in London on our way to Tel Aviv.  We wanted our hotel to be part of  our London experience.  We were searching for a boutique hotel with character that portrays the elegance and proper standards that really represent London at it's finest.  This hotel was absolutely that and more.  Thank you for a fabulous stay!  Great location as well.
January 2016,A Magical Pocket of Perfection!,"My husband & i have been to '41' on many occasions  ~ Absolutely every time we stay at this gorgeous hotel we are SOO totally happy!!! We have stopped trying other hotels in London….. Nowhere else 'ticks all the boxes'. Terrific location, always the most fabulous reception the moment we arrive, lovely staff who make us feel genuinely & warmly welcomed.  The entire package is Amazing & having to leave is dreadful!   We happily nest in the lounge for hours ~ Sink into the sofa beside the fire, served cracking canapés & warm mini ham toasties etc.  The 'pantry' is very exciting too, throughout the day x night it is bursting with Goodies… cheese/Deli gems, chocolates and sweets and fruit and…!  However, if you are still hungry and fancy some fresh air, walking is a pleasure in the…"
February 2016,A true boutique,"Hotel 41 is a place unlike most.  At 41, you get the service of a 5-star hotel, the décor of a proper London dwelling, and the feeling of being at home.  Unlike most places, the only people allowed into the hotel are the guests.  While at other hotels the elevators and lounge spots may be taken by persons off the street, at 41 the entire experience is about the guests.  The GM, Mr. Hendry, can be found in the lounge talking with guests and staff, ensuring the hotel is doing everything to accommodate needs you may have.  Lauren at the desk is astute and just seems to get it, anticipating what you are looking for and providing the exact right information or assistance.  And their staff work as hard (and are as kind) as any I have seen in my travel.  The best example from 41’s…"
February 2016,Fantastic Stay,"We have just returned from a fabulous two night stay at Hotel 41 in London.  The hotel staff were friendly, polite, attentive and ready to assist whenever required.  We returned fro seeing 'Wicked' to find that the staff had arranged for the CD from the show to be playing in our room.  As we left, we were sent on our way with complimentary sweets and coffees for the journey - brilliant!!"
February 2016,Amazing stay,"It was amazing stay. We felt like a king :) Our room was spacious, very well equipment. Bed was very soft and comfortable. The location is also very good - a few steps to Victoria underground station and to the Buckingham Palace. The staff was wonderful especially Polish ladies: Magdalena, Patrycja and Paula. It is really worth to be there and it's for sure our No 1:) in London.   Paweł & Joanna"
January 2016,Amazing stay - the staff are the stars,"This is such a special place, a unique little haven of calm in Central London. The minute we arrived, we were warmly welcomed and swiftly helped with all the chaos of our bags and small dog, to immediate calm. Even before arrival, with various phone conversations and emails, the service was excellent, and that just continued throughout our stay.   The hotel itself is quiet and relaxing, with the Lounge the central area for checking in (the front desk staff here are so helpful and lovely), and for eating, drinking and relaxing (or working, if you have to). Steve and the rest of the staff here just make you feel so welcome, are genuinely friendly without being intrusive, and are always on hand to tempt you with the various delicious complimentary delights that are laid on…"
September 2015,A Private Retreat in a Great Location,This hotel is excellently located next to Buckingham Palace and very close to Victoria Station.  It is the perfect retreat after a busy day in the city or to recover from a long flight.    The library and lounge area surrounds you with quiet and graceful English elegance - you'll feel like you're in the library at Downton Abbey for a cup of tea with the Duke and Duchess.  The rooms are also beautifully decorated and well insulated from the sounds of the city which helps to provide for a good night's sleep.   The staff and service is excellent and very attentive to your every need.  Advice: Finding this hotel can be a bit tricky since the outside is very understated.  I often have to tell the cabbie to go to the Ruben's Hotel which is next door to Hotel 41.
January 2016,Fabulous,"Worthy of the all rave reviews. We stayed for 2 nights and I could have cheerfully moved in!  Quiet, friendly but exemplary service, super breakfasts, great complimentary evening supper courtesy of the ""plunder the pantry"" facility. Definitely worth booking in advance for the best prices and worth asking the team to source theatre tickets etc.  We would stay again in a heartbeat."
January 2016,Perfect Anniversary,"This was a truly wonderful, relaxing stay. The staff were so attentive, nothing was too much trouble. We were thoroughly spoilt with champagne on arrival, a gorgeous cake for our anniversary, and a very quiet room. Considering this is central London, it was like an oasis, very relaxing indeed. We will definitely be returning to 41 !"
February 2016,Amazing Hotel worthy of 6 stars,"My husband and I travel extensively and stay in hotels all over the UK, usually  of a four or five  star rating.  How this Hotel has not got 6 stars I do not know!  You will not be disappointed if you choose this Hotel.  Once you stay here you will not wish to stay anywhere else in London again.   The welcome reception was really lovely with a drink and nibbles on arrival.  A beautiful executive lounge to sit in and relax.   All of the staff are exceptionally lovely and nothing is too much trouble.  They really do make you feel very special.   Our room 4101 was very comfortable with views over the Royal Mews.  The bed was huge and very comfortable, high quality sheets and pillows and luxury duvet.   The bathroom had large bath and shower with ample Penhaligon toiletries, luxury…"
February 2016,Simply fabulous ,"My recent stay at hotel 41 exceeded all expectations and I can see why the hotel is number one in London.  The two ladies that helped me at check in and check out were excellent and could not do enough for me.  The hotel is beautiful as is the room. The fire place in particular is a wonderful touch.  The drinks and snacks in the executive lounge were also great and the service impeccable. As was the food I ordered by room service, absolutely delicious.  All in all hotel 41 is an excellent place to stay and I would recommend the hotel to anybody who is going to London.  I hope to return soon. "
May 2015,Service beyond compare,"Our stay lasted a week, so we had the full experience and can confidently say their service is beyond compare. The main lounge is remarkable, being both elegant and comfortable; You can truly relax here. You sip cocktails by the fire and feel you are in the home of a good friend who just happens to make killer martinis. Having tea in the late afternoon? Be sure to leaf through any of a number of gorgeous coffee table books on Rock Gods or Fashion or Art & Architecture which you always mean to purchase, never do and turn out to be even more interesting than you imagined. This is where you will have breakfast and breakfast *is* the most important meal of the day. Every day my husband had something new and every day I had the same two egg omelette with toast and tea; Every day our…"
January 2016,Words can't describe how you are treated in this hotel.,"A very close friend and I were extremely lucky to stay in this hotel in January 2016, I booked the room 7 days in advance for the price of 295 pounds, which, from the reviews I believed to be a reasonable price! We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by one of the nicest hotel workers I have ever encountered, unfortunately his name slips my mind however even his conversation and genuine interest in our situation was comforting and pleasant. We were taken to the executive lounge to check in where we were offered champagne which was complimentary! I was then charged 50 pounds for any items we may use while in the hotel however this was put back into my account promptly when I left the hotel after not using any of the extra items or services on offer. What made this stay…"
January 2016,bubble of luxury,"My boyfriend treated me to staying at hotel 41 and it's an amazing hotel, the staff can't do enough for you and there are lots of complimentary perks, champagne on arrival, canapes, fireplace lit and curtains drawn for your return in the evening being just some of them.  Your in an ideal location for being amongst the tourist attractions London has to offer, but perfectly when you step inside the hotel you can even forget where you are and just enjoy being in your own bubble of luxury.  I highly recommend a visit!"
December 2015,Top place to stay in London,"Hands down, possibly the best hotel I have stayed in. The service is top notch...so welcoming, so helpful, and so professional. The rooms are quiet, clean, comfortable, and luxurious. During my visit, in which I was visiting while my husband was in London for work, the hotel placed us in one of their suites...it was incredible. The food, which we only had breakfast, dessert, and some snacks were good. For my first English breakfast, I loved it. One of the days we ordered a shrimp cocktail for a snack to our room and they came with a different (nicer) shrimp dish than the menu, which was awesome.  The location of the hotel felt super convenient to wherever we wanted to go. It allowed us to easily walk over to buckingham and through the parks to explore more of London.  My husband…"
January 2016,Absolutely perfect!,"We stayed this weekend at this boutique hotel expecting a nice experience a the reviews were pretty good. I have to say that I and my friends were absolutely delighted with the quality of the service and the attention to detail. Rooms where wonderfully and tastefully decorated and any conceivable need was already taken care of.  The food served at breakfast and through out the day was very good. we felt really spoiled and I would like to thank again the staff and their management for such a stunning performance. Please note this is my first review ever!  I have stayed in wonderful hotels in London but so far this exceeded my expectations and this is why I take the time. To conclude, it is a wonderful place to stay while in London for short or long term so go for it any time your…"
October 2015,Luxurious honeymoon!,"We stayed 2 nights at this hotel. From the moment we entered the premise, we were greeted by our names, and refreshments.  My wife got her hot chocolate (Starbucks).  We were then escorted to the Executive Lounge at level 5 to check in.  Upon check in, we were served a glass of champagne and canapés, which were very nice.    The room is big, clean and luxurious. My wife ordered a cycling bike and it was there in the room waiting for us! There was also a personalised card from the hotel and cake for us in the room.   We loved the 'Raid the Pantry' in the Executive Lounge. There you can have as many ice cream, chips, tipbits, cheeses and drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic).  Service was thoughtful and personal. They were always there to help with anything. One thing special…"
January 2016,Truly special,"My best friend and I stayed at Hotel 41 during our week-long trip to London to celebrate the new year. The experience was fantastic from the moment we walked in until the moment we checked out.  We arrived early in the morning on Saturday 1/2, expecting that we would drop off our bags and check in later when our room was ready. We were whisked to the executive lounge, where we were offered a glass of champagne and checked in. Andrew told us that we would have a temporary room to freshen up and relax while our room was prepared. He then proceeded to spend 45 minutes mapping out places to eat and drink while we were in London.   Our room was ready at 1:00 in the afternoon, and it was really perfect. It was nicely laid out, comfortable, and quiet. The bed was excellent, and…"
January 2016,All other hotels bow down to Hotel 41,"We visited here for my fiancee's birthday. It was a stop over while we saw Billy Elliot and did some retail therapy. When we arrived at the hotel we entered the building and proceeded to check in until the receptionist told us we don't have a booking.....I was devastated but luckily she said we are booked in their sister hotel next door. We had used the wrong door and were in the Rubens hotel instead (which loooked very nice by the way). Whoops.....panic over we entered Hotel 41. We were early but this didn't seem a problem for them. We were told to leave our bags at reception and were taken to the executive lounge. The lounge is lovely and a very relaxing place to be in between sight seeing, shopping and seeing a show. There is a complimentary buffet available all day till 1am…"
January 2016,Best of the best,"Many hotels say they have excellent service. This one does. There is a button on the phone console named ""any time/anything."" which says it all. The room we stayed in and the lounge were beautifully appointed.  Food delicious.  We were treated like royalty."
January 2016,A must when in London,"I stayed here for my birthday this week. The hotel, staff, service were all exceptional! They cannot do enough for you and the champagne on arrival was fantastic  as were the treats and and canapés. As it was my birthday a cake were waiting in my room and the staff wished me happy birthday on many occasions."
December 2015,Superb,"Stayed here on a recent visit to the smoke for a concert at the O2, chosen really only from other TA reviews. Nothing disappointed, the place is excellent, the staff are excellent and, as previously said by others, everyone goes out of their way to make you feel at home. The buffet spread continually impressed and almost surprised us when it was freshened up after midnight one evening when most places would be thinking about packing away for the evening! Even the hot water system was impressive with the hot water being instantaneous whenever you put a tap on! Return visit? Most certainly whenever we visit London again for sure!"
November 2015,As Advertised,"They have an extension on the room phone labeled ""Whatever Whenever"". This in essence describes the level of service at Hotel 41 London. The entire staff was truly exceptional. If you want to be treated the way everyone should always treat each other, then this is the hotel for you."
November 2015,Brilliant Service exceeded expectations.,"The Hotel 41 is a decadent property minutes away from Buckingham Palace, Harrods, pubs and restaurants.The accommodations and surroundings are as expected for a hotel at this address, but the staff and management are superb. The service was outstanding,attention to detail;impressive and the custom made treats and snacks; delicious. Steve Jones, in particular, was brilliant. We followed his schedule to ensure the stay of all 8 of us was perfect. He suggested shops, places to eat, shared in the laughs but truly never lost sight of the service level expected. We will return because he was the difference. The Hotel 41 exceeded expectations."
November 2015,Brilliant,"Couldn't have been better, would recommend to anyone who wants to have a great time.  Staff was really friendly, food great, cocktails are great and I love the fact the you have access to the executive lounge. Overall would defiantly come back again"
November 2015,truly superb,"Given all the excellent reviews, expectations were high and yes, 41 and the team delivered. Even before we arrived we got help in making some difficult to get dinner reservations, once we were there we were taken care off so well we did not want to leave. Location great, lounge so welcoming and comfy, coming home to the logfire and rose petals in the room was almost too much :-) and we loved plunder the pantry for an inbetween snack. Overall truly superb!"
November 2015,"Wonderful, wouldn't stay anywhere else in London","Second time back at Hotel 41 and won't be our last. The rooms are beautiful but it's the staff who make this hotel so unique with their warmth and charm. They really can't do enough for their guests, highlighted perfectly by the "" whatever, whenever"" button in the rooms! Amazing!"
December 2014,The most amazing hotel in the UK,"One of the best hotels you will ever stay in central London  Not only the best in London but probably the best you will ever stay in FACT  Staff were awesome, food next level... And I cannot stress just how fabulous this hotel is...  From an exquisite interior and lounge area to Buffett food options...  Hotels suites are about average for London at £500 a night but room service at 2am for a chap that wanted a burger and chips after a night out on the town...  Could not be more accommodating and a rare find in central londom"
November 2015,Lived up to expectations,We spent 4 nights at Hotel 41 to celebrate my 50th birthday. Firstly the location is perfect - a few minutes to walk to Buckingham Palace (we wandered along and saw the changing of the guard by accident!) and a 20 minute walk to Piccadilly Circus.  The staff was fantastic - friendly and helpful.  The room although not big was so comfortable and the best equipped room I have ever stayed in - if you needed it the chances are it was there!  The executive lounge was where everything happened!  The breakfasts were lovely although we stuck with the continental 2 of the 4 days as there was a great choice and we took full advantage of the 'plunder the pantry' one evening - we had eaten in a Michelin star restaurant the evening before and my other half actually thought the hotel food was…
November 2015,Perfect for families!!,"First, i should say that i traveled with my wife and our one year old toddler (sofia).  We have been to all kind of luxury hotels (al maha, conrad maldives, etc) and this is one is one of those. You can say, that it's different, i agree, but still a luxury resort.  Even though you do not have amenities such as pool, spa, etc, their first amenity is their hospitality, second their attention to details and third their service.   It was our anniversary, and they not only provided a cake but they also decorated our room with candles and rose petals.  Service. Whenever we wanted a reservation we contacted front desk and they did all reservations for us. That's a big plus. Whatever we needed for our baby they provided in matter of seconds.   Room: its a big size room, with an…"
October 2015,Wonderful and unforgettable stay at Hotel 41,"This was our second time at the 41, as we decided to celebrate my 40th birthday there. The staff is really excellent, attentive. They reached out to us days before our arrival to ensure everything is prepared for our arrival. I think its those little details that make a hotel stand out from the rest - they truly make you feel home. The room was beautifully decorated, rose petals, pralines, candles - it was a truly memorable birthday. We stayed for three nights this time, the only regret I have is that we were not able to stay longer, it was hard to leave. I definitely want to come back to the 41 on my 41st birthday."
July 2015,Superb hotel with excellent service,We stayed at Hotel 41 during our honeymoon. We loved our room and the friendly staff. Excellent location and a wonderful experience overall. Complimentary snacks and coffee were nice perks. Very glad that we extended our stay at the hotel.
December 2015,Outstanding establishment ,"Stayed for Christmas and anniversary trip. Staff at 41 are better than anywhere else I have stayed, so attentive and everything with our stay was personalised to us! So thoughtful. Great location for London hotel. Fantastic stay and will definitely be back when we can! "
February 2015,London Style and Luxury,"The rooms in this lovely hotel are on the top floor and some have working fireplaces. I cannot say enough about the gracious staff. Every single person was fabulous and wanted to make sure all was perfect.  I particularly love the champagne offered upon arrival. My room was comfortable and spotless with a view of the Royal Mews. I appreciated the tasteful decor throughout 41.  I enjoyed  breakfast in the hotel, ""Plunder the Pantry""which gave me access to snacks throughout the day, hors d'oeuvres in the lounge in the evening, free ice cream and the perfectly stocked honesty bar.   No request is too difficult. I asked for arrangements for a car to take me to the Royal Opera House and the staff was happy to do that or to call a taxi for me. I was given easy walking directions for…"
December 2015,This is a REAL Gem,"WOW, this hotel is AMAZING, our second visit to 41, equally as impressive as our first visit. Attention to detail is first class, great rooms, very comfortable and the fire is a real treat when you go to your room after a long day in London. The executive lounge, with its roaring fire and great food and drink selection is a must.  Very hard to fault this GREAT hotel & the staff are all FANTASTIC.  Can't wait for the next visit."
May 2015,Just when you think it can't get any better... it does!,"This is my sixth stay at 41. Again, I am lost for words as to the level of service provided by this property, the level of support, the degree to which the staff are willing to go.  It is incredible and it is better than a home from home. It is an entire team devoted to ensuring you are comfortable and that all your needs are met- no matter what they are. It does not matter if you need an extremely rare object, they will look, or if you need someone to set up a perfect platter. Whatever it is, the staff will take wonderful care of you.  For everyone considering Hotel 41 for their stay in London, I beseech you not to look elsewhere. Do yourself a favor and stay here- I have stayed in many of the world's finest hotels, including most of London's, and there is nowhere that can even…"
December 2015,No way can this be the best hotel in London........,Yes its a nice hotel. The staff are excellent and the rooms are comfortable. But it doesn't compare with the luxury and facilities of the likes of The Dorchester etc. It operates a mega expensive even for London honesty bar system. So don't get caught out at checkout. The rooms are well equipped with various toiletries only what you would expect at the room rate. Summing up. Its nothing special. If you travel a lot and have experienced some of the worlds leading hotels this is like a glorified B & B with good staff.
December 2015,Comfortable and friendly,"We had a faultless and very enjoyable one-night stay here. We booked a standard room but were upgraded on arrival to what was described as the best room in the house (4104) - it was on two floors, with a cost sitting area complete with flame gas fire downstairs and bedroom and large bathroom upstairs. The crowning glory was a large glass atrium over the bed, with a panoramic view of the heavens above! My wife arrived very early, well before check-in time (I had a meeting in town), and was offered every courtesy and full use of the comfortable lounge until the room was available. Throughout our stay the staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful. We were on a breakfast-inclusive rate and the breakfast was superb. We had an evening meal at the adjoining B-Bar (part of…"
December 2015,Amazing customer service,"Have visited 5 star hotels all over the world and this without doubt was my beat customer service experience. Stayed for 2 nights over the weekend, on arrival all members of staff were very welcoming and we enjoyed some champaign. Not all my stay was perfect in the aspect the floors are very noisy when trying to sleep, so had a sleepless couple of nights. What i will say though is I still give this a five star simply for presentation and service from all employees, so for them to get me to look past this was fantastic. Each and every member of staff took a genuine interest in your days and plans and I would definitely be visiting the hotel again."
December 2015,50th Birthday Treat,"We visited 41 for two nights from the the 2nd to 4th December.  It was to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday and we had two rooms. One they set up as a twin for my two grown up daughters (4109) and a king size for ourselves (4105).  Both rooms were fabulous and have just about everything you could ever need. The staff are absolutely first class and cater for your every need. I cannot fault the service we had from the moment we checked in to the moment we left so thank you to Andrew and the team......  It's probably the most I've ever paid for a room at a hotel but have to say it was good value compared to other top end London hotels and if in London again this is where we will stay.  If you want a peaceful, quiet hotel with top service look no further. "
December 2015,Wow! Absolute amazing and fantastically high levels of service!,"Recently stayed here for two nights, we arrived on Saturday around 8pm, taken up to the hotel level (floor 5). We had champaign of our choice while we checked in. We got shown to our room... Absolutely fantastic! A very nice fresh fruit bowl with a bottle of bubbly and a very nicely presented evening turn down. Breakfast both mornings was absolutely fantastic! The best poached eggs I've ever had! Again with a glass of bubbly. The plunder the pantry is fantastic.. Snacks all day.  We even had a few snacks prepared for us to keep us going on our shopping trip. We checked out at 12 but our train wasn't until 8pm... We was invited back after our day out for a drink and snacks before we leave. I've never been to such a well run hotel. Never have I received such high levels of…"
December 2015,Outstanding,"Well where do I start from the moment we walked into the hotel it was absolutely amazing the staff Were very professional and caring, especially Andrew.  The room was beautiful and the little touches in the room with his and her slippers,sweets,fruit and the little elemis gifts each night was just wonderful.  We enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere in the executive lounge you have the right balance for breakfast and then to enjoy a nice glass of champagne and cocktails during the evening.  By far the most amazing weekend we have ever had.  We can't wait to return to stay with you on New Year's Eve for 4 nights.  I have not stopped talking about the hotel and recommended it to everyone"
October 2015,Special stay in a special place,"My wife and I stayed in London one night on the way back to the states. We picked Hotel 41 based on TripAdvisor reviews and were not disappointed. It's hard to tell how special the hotel is based on the website and reviews. It is completely like a club atmosphere and not a hotel. All the rooms are on the same level (5th floor). The common space is an executive lounge that is intimate, comfortable and inviting. All of the staff seem to go out of their way to know your name, attend to your needs and make sure you are more than satisfied with your stay. We found Flo, in particular, to offer exceptional service. Checking in with a glass of fine champagne and enjoying mimosas for breakfast was fabulous. We didn't see any children, but the hotel assured us they love children. If you…"
October 2015,Great stay,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel 41 in early October, 2015.  It was like staying in a private home with concierge service.  There is a common room which serves breakfast and tea as well as complimentary food throughout the day until 1 a.m.  The staff was very helpful in arranging dinner reservations, obtaining theater tickets, providing directions and information. Also, because the hotel is small  the staff knew who you were and  provided personalized service. The rooms are cozy and comfortable"
September 2015,An Amazing Birthday Present!,"I booked a room at Hotel 41 for the night of my birthday on account of the excellent reviews and was not disappointed! From the moment you arrive, to the moment you leave, you feel like you're part of something special. I've stayed in a number of 5 star hotels in London, which don't compare to the experience at Hotel 41. Staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough for you. I enjoyed the champagne on check-in and the canape's on offer. It was enough food that I didn't need to have dinner. I was fortunate enough to receive a complimentary upgrade to a suite which to my surprise contained a lovely birthday cake and desserts! I appreciated having the Nespresso machine, as well as the fabulous toiletries and slippers. I unfortunately missed out on experiencing 'plunder the…"
October 2015,Absolutely perfect,"If you are visiting London for business or pleasure, be sure to stay at this hotel. It offers everything your heart desires: Very nice and courteous staff. Extremely clean, nice and spacious rooms for London. A great concept with a private lounge and very tasty afternoon and evening snacks. The location between victoria station and Buckingham Palace is perfect for exploring London."
August 2015,It was a fantastic stay!,"It was a fantastic stay in 41 hotels. All of the staffs from reception to manager are very friendly and kind and professional! The services there is perfect! I received the magazines what I like when I request in check-in time! The brunch we ate in lounge but because we waited for a while, it changed to be complimentary gift, which surprised us! Even in dinner, they switch my main course due to I just said it was different than I though, therefore they gave me one what I expect! Endless memorable details brought to me! I strongly recommend this hotel to those who loved nicely British decoration and pay attention to staffs services. I could say it's most personalized services in my life! More than 5 stars! Hopefully we could be back there very soon! By Mr Yuan and Miss Chen"
September 2015,First Class Service,"Hotel 41 is first class in all aspects but particularly the service delivered by each and every staff member we had the pleasure to deal with. We have stayed at a lot of top-end hotels where service is great but this hotel is exceptional. From attentiveness to every detail of your stay, to knowledge of London and things to do, to everything else in between. Nothing was too much trouble.    Excellent location, close to all the best parts of London. Loved the hotel decor, the quirky artwork especially.  We were sad to leave. Definitely worth paying extra to stay here."
October 2015,Great stay at Hotel 41,"Great location (Victoria Station), great staff, wonderful service. The quality / price ratio is often terrible in London hotels but that's not the case here. Cozy, elegant atmosphere with excellent personalized service. I was travelling for business and was happy to have such a lovely, friendly hotel after a long day of work and travelling."
October 2015,Service was spectacular!,"There's nothing the staff could've done to make us feel more welcome.   Everyone was always smiling, they called us by name and were very engaging. We mentioned that we were going to see Billy Elliot and they even got us a program to enjoy before the show!  Thank you everyone!!"
October 2015,Perfection on our Honeymoon ,This hotel is even more spectacular then I expected.The accommodations are the best & we have never felt so pampered in our lives. Thank you to ALL of the staff & to the manager that brought me to tears of joy for such hospitality. We will stay here again in our future travels. 
August 2015,Not Possible to Top This Hotel,"Everyone was helpful, the room was a delight, the breakfast excellent, the round the clock buffet marvelous, even the ice cream was different and exotic.  When we went to get in the cab to go to Heathrow, one employee took our luggage and another held an umbrella over our heads!  There are two excellent restaurants on each side of the hotel!!  If you're coming to London, come here!  "
May 2015,ABSOLUTELY OUSTANDING!!!!,"Oh my where do I start!  We spent our wedding night here and got upgraded to the most amazing Conservatory suite....it took our breath away!!  From the moment we checked in we were treated like royalty, such friendly staff who chatted and asked us about our day, champagne on arrival, chocolates and fruits in the room, rose petals on the bed and and jacuzzi bath run for us at night with floating candles  This has to be one of the BEST hotels I have ever stayed and I will certainly be returning, as for recommending I am not sure I can do that as I want this little kept secret all to myself :-)  Keep up the amazing work Hotel 41 you are truly the best"
September 2015,Royal treatment,"Beginning at the less-than-grand entrance, then stepping inside into the small but beautiful downstairs lobby, you have no idea of what awaits you upstairs. It only gets better and better, believe me. Our room (Executive King) was spacious by European standards, well appointed with ample closet space, lovely bed linens, quality vanity items, and spotless bathroom with shower and separate large bath tub.  The lounge and dining area was very pretty with plenty of tables for meals and comfy seating arrangements for conversation and cocktails. It was a pleasant spot with first-class service.  The concierge was helpful in arranging tickets to various attractions and plays, along with directions to walkable sites. Overall we were thrilled with our good fortune to have picked Hotel 41…"
September 2015,The best ever!,"We can't say enough about the Hotel 41.  Between the fabulous rooms, the best shower, ""plunder the pantry"" and the best staff ever, I don't know how to keep my praise to a few sentences.  Just let me say, if you stay here, you won't be disappointed."
September 2015,A Different Twist,"Perfectly located (along side of Buckingham Palace) this hotel offers superb service and a lot of it.  We had been traveling for two months and had stayed in many 5 star hotels during this trip, but ""41"" is a step above.  Love the fact that there are only 22 rooms & 6 suites and love, love, love ""raid the pantry"".  Having met friends for late lunches two days and the theater another evening, all we needed was a little bite in the evening and ""the pantry"" was there for us.  It was a perfect way to end a 2 month trip.  However, now I'm spoiled; I can't imagine staying anywhere else when visiting London."
November 2014,Perfection!,Best hotel we have ever stayed at by far. The hotel is pricey but the service is excellent! We have already booked our trip again for this year. Stayed at many 5 star hotels before and the uniqueness of the boutique along with the welcoming service does not compare! 
September 2015,Best hotel ever!,"We stayed one night at hotel 41. It was the last night of a 'once in a lifetime' holiday to celebrate being with my wife for 30 years and our upcoming 50th birthdays. We had taken the Orient Express to Venice which was opulent beyond our wildest dreams. We then relaxed in Venice for 2 days, afterwhich we returned to London to finish off with what we hoped would be a lovely stay at the hotel 41...but it wasn't lovely....it was fantastic... The best hotel I have ever stayed at....from the doorman to the manager to the waiters and waitresses.... They made us feel special. If I could repeat this trip again, I would start with a night at the hotel 41, go on the Orient Express then come straight back to stay at the hotel 41 again. Thank you for putting the icing on the cake that was…"
September 2015,Overwhelming,"We recently stayed at Hotel 41 or our 10th anniversary. We would like to thank the entire team for making our stay such an amazing and unforgettable event. Everything was taken care of for us extremely well. All the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We would like to especially thank Mrs Monika Skrzynska for her care and detail, she made sure everything was set for our celebration throughout the entire time of our stay.  We stayed at the conservatory suite and our room was prepared in such manner, that we couldn't have asked for anything more.Comparing this to other luxury hotels we have stayed at we were extremely impressed. We will always remember our celebration at Hotel 41 and return in the future."
September 2015,How is this #1??,"At time of booking this hotel was number 1 on TA. Foolishly I thought we were in for the treat of a lifetime. Sadly, while this place is very pleasant, in a superb location and very lovely there are many London hotels which would knock it hands down. Staff looked after us very well if in s slightly cloying way. Main problems were the very noisy plumbing and a mysterious red light which prevented housekeeping from servicing the room. (To be fair though they had dropped in a note to ask us to call for service but we returned too late). All in all a good, albeit a little dated, hotel in a very prestigious neighbourhood!"
November 2015,Big birthday stay,"We stayed here overnight on Sunday 25/10/15 and everything I had read was totally true!! I booked it as a surprise for my husband's birthday (along with dinner at Heston's a short walk away - also fantastic!) after reading the fab reviews about its quirky atmosphere, amazing staff and great location. I was not disappointed with any aspect. The booking process was easy, check in was luxurious and a lovely change from the impersonal check ins at other hotels. We enjoyed a lovely glass of champagne then, as the room wasn't ready, which I had been told I advance and was not a problem, e left our overnight bag to enjoy the rest if the day in London.  On returning to the hotel the staff were again wonderfully smiley and attentive, we went to our room - complete with gorgeous treats…"
October 2015,50th Birthday Trip,"My wife had done extensive research on where to stay for my 50th birthday visit and I am pleased to say that she could not have picked a better hotel in the whole of London to spend our 3 days celebrating my 50th birthday earlier this week.  Where to start? Firstly the welcome is unbelievable. You are whisked from a very discrete lobby, via the lift up to the fifth floor where all the rooms are, to the exceutive lounge to check in. You are handed a glass of champagne immediately to help you relax and start to enjoy the stay. The staff made you feel so welcome and at ease - I will return to the staff later, although to call them that does all of them an injustice as they felt like friends!  Our room was stunning and so tasteful. There would be nothing I would change. The food was…"
October 2015,Perfect,"My partner and I stayed here for one night to celebrate our 5th anniversary. It was simply wonderful.   When we arrived we were greeted with champagne and then shown around before being taken to our beautiful room. There was a yummy chocolate cake waiting for us which said 'happy anniversary' aswell as a plate of little treats.   The room was comfy and so nicely decorated. It was a bit warm for us in the room even with the air conditioning on, but we are from the north so it was like our summer in London!   We shared a bottle of wine in the executive lounge and were presented with canapés which were really tasty. After going out for a few cocktails, we went to 'plunder the pantry' which was perfect! We went away with 3 platefuls of food and felt a bit greedy, but the friendly…"
October 2015,An amazing night away!,"I stayed here with my girlfriend for one night last Thursday and we were both bowled over by the Hotel. On arrival we  were escorted to the fifth floor where the reception is and Florent was very helpful and charming providing us with a glass of champagne after our travels. Check in was quick and we got a tour of the Executive Lounge which was very impressive and definitely felt 'exclusive'. The Hotel itself is small but beautifully appointed with gorgeous rooms and you rarely run in to other guests giving you more of an 'isolated' feeling, perfect for us. I proposed to my girlfriend that evening and she said yes and it certainly helped that the hotel turndown service was so impressive with champagne and candles, chocolates, music etc. The honesty bar is very nice too, food is…"
October 2015,A jolly olde week,"We returned 2 weeks ago from a lovely 7 night  stay at the 41 Hotel. The 41 was even better than we had expected  even after all  the glowing reviews we'd read about it. The location was perfect between Buckingham  Palace and Victoria Station.We were minutes from the Underground, but could also walk to many of the major attractions. Our duplex suite was roomy and finely furnished. All the food :  ""raid the pantry"", breakfasts, afternoon snacks including daily treats in the lobby ,wine and cocktails served in the lounge were delicious and signature touches that set this hotel apart., but the real strength of this hotel is their staff. There was no one who didn't seem to enjoy their position or who wasn't knowledgeable, personable and professional. They all worked to make our stay…"
October 2015,A wonderful experience and service that is second to none,"We stayed at this hotel for one night recently to celebrate a big birthday. Like a lot of people, we have been fortunate enough to stay in luxury hotels around the world and I can honestly say that the service here rivals anything experienced elsewhere. It feels a bit of a cliché to repeat the accolades given by other reviewers, but they are completely merited.   The surroundings are beautiful and very relaxing. The staff are attentive, without being fawning or over-the-top, and seem genuinely to be enjoying themselves. Staff who come in for a special mention are Andrew, Steve and Dickson (A true gentleman. ""Tea in the morning, champagne in the evening"" was his motto for our stay, a man after my own heart!), although everyone we met went the extra mile, including one man who…"
October 2015,Terrific!,"We loved this hotel. Quirky, charming and so comfortable.  The entire staff was so professional, upbeat and couldn't do enough for us.  We were also with two other couples and they even gave us our own private room for breakfast each morning. So many little touches and extras were included..  breakfast, tea and mini sandwiches, amazing hot chocolate waiting at the door, candies & ice cream at night, mood sprays at turndown.  It's rare to find this kind of hospitality. Stay here!"
October 2015,Perfection ,"I was in town for 24 hours and this property is perfection.  It starts with a champagne greeting at check-in, yummy snacks, truffles in the room and lush linens and pillows for a restful evening.  Really a lovely experience and I think we'll stay longer next time."
October 2015,Best place to stay ,"Came here for my birthday, me and my friends stayed for 2 nights and it was perfect! The staff where so helpful and lovely! Also the food was amazing! We had no problems here and we will definitely come back when we are next in London, the room sizes where nicely sized too. "
September 2015,Always exceeds expectations,This is the only place we stay in London.  They have truly exceptional service and the rooms are all wonderful and unique.  They never fail to surpass our expectations on each visit.  We look forward to visiting again each time we return.
September 2015,Truly a 5 star hotel,"Hotel 41, located right across the street from the Buckingham Palace complex was the nicest hotel we have ever stayed in.  It is a small hotel with a nice ground floor entrance with all the rooms are all on the 5th floor of a beautifully remodeled older building.  A real King sized bed, fireplace in the room, separate shower and tub.  Everything was first class.  We booked through Costco travel which included an extensive continental breakfast each morning and a free dinner at the partner restaurant next door.  The dinner even included all drinks.  The dining room looks is a beautiful mahogany wood room that looks more like a library in a multi million dollar home than the restaurant.  It is open all day and night with free snacks, meats, cheeses, etc.    One of the most…"
August 2015,Amazing Wedding Night!,We spent our wedding night at the Fabulous Hotel 41 and really can't praise them enough. The service really is second to none. From the first greeting to when we left everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful. Without asking they moved us into the conservatory suite which is a stunning room with rose petals everywhere!  Thank you so much for making the night so special... I couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough. In every way they go the extra mile to ensure you have a great stay.
August 2015,Outstanding Dirty Gin Martinis at the 41.,"The 41 is a lovely discrete boutique hotel. The staff are very friendly and attentive and they mix the best DGM (Dirty Gin Martini). The hotel has a genteel ambiance and it was great to be able to come back after a show and 'raid the pantry'. A wonderful 3 days and thank you for the bottle of bubbles on my birthday, very thoughtful."
June 2015,Back again ,What can i say about this hotel this got to be only of the best hotel in London and their getting better and better the rooms are very nice and very clean the beds are very nice and comfortable as well this is my second visit in a few month and it won't be the last 
August 2015,Simply delightful,"Our stay at Hotel 41 was delightful even before we checked in for a four day weekend to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. A few days prior to our arrival I received a preference questionnaire: Were we celebrating a special occasion? Did we want feather or foam pillows? Would I like some flowers delivered to the room? Would we like a car arranged to pick us up at the airport? This was indicative of the hotel's attention to detail.  The staff at Hotel 41 are serious about service.  If you have a preference, they will oblige you and remember your choice.  Rather than having a separate number for room service, housekeeping, etc., there is simply the ""Whatever, whenever"" button on your telephone. Why would you want or need anything else?  At breakfast our second morning,…"
June 2015,Comfort and Style !!!!!,"This is definitely the best Hotel in London! My grandson and I returned this past June for our yearly European Trip. We absolutely love it! This is our third year staying at the 41 Hotel. Upon our arrival we were greeted by the same wonderful staff who are so friendly and accommodating to us every year. The Hotel is very beautiful with it's black and white décor which is classy and elegant. I have traveled around the world and I've stayed in a lot of nice Hotel but this one by far is the finest and it is truly because of the staff at this hotel they truly pride themselves in excellent customer service and kindness.  Jeffrey Shaner Las Vegas, Nevada"
August 2015,Small and perfectly formed!,"I've had the pleasure of staying on 41 on a number of occasions now,  we had a wonderful weekend this month to celebrate our 21st wedding anniversary.  It's still a joy to walk into the hushed lobby and be escorted upstairs and offered a choice of fine champagne while you relax and check in. As a repeat visitor it was great that a number of staff remembered me from the last visit and it's like catching up with an old friend. The bottle of champagne provided by the hotel on hearing of our anniversary was a lovely gesture and really appreciated  - Louis Roderer, my favourite as it happens.  Everyone here is so helpful and it's always nice to see the GM at breakfast maintaining a quiet but approachable presence which is not the case at many 5 star establishments.  The balance…"
August 2015,Nice Stay,Having read all the reviews on trip adviser i was really expecting something very special to other five star properties that i have stayed at over the years but this didn't happen The Property is well maintained and the staff as a whole are great a special mention to Dixion who was fantastic however i thought the front desk as they did not have a separate conceirge was not as knowledgable as others i have stayed at. The bedroom was well appointed with a nice sized bathroom and plenty of hanging space and well maintained  The Breakfast was very good and the Burger for lunch is probably one of the best i have ever had 41 is small and intermit and we enjoyed our stay
August 2015,Service Perfection,"We spent a long weekend visiting London and made Hotel 41 our base. We stayied in the Conservatory suite. From the moment of arrival the service was exceptional. All the staff are very friendly, remember your names, take an interest in what you are doing and nothing is too much trouble. Excellent breakfasts, great afternoon tea and the most comfortable bed I have slept on, in any hotel, anywhere, ever. Highly recommended."
July 2015,Oh Dear--Too Good!!,"First time and had some expectations, but-WOW!--this establishment is both sophisticated, elegant, and yet, fun. Staff is excellent, the food first-class, the suite was exemplary in every detail (where are the nicks and scratches on the furniture, why isn't the carpeting stained, why is everything just right!?). I cannot say enough about my stay and it contributed so much to enjoying my London vacation.  Thank you, 41--I'll be back,"
August 2015,Perfect in every way,"I can't be positive enough about my experience at 41. I chose it as the location for me to propose to my girlfriend and everything was perfect.  Within days of booking and leaving a note stating my intentions, I was personally contacted by a lovely guy called Remus, who proceeded to help me plan every details of the day. He was fantastic and really set my mind at ease and assured me all would be well.  When we actually arrived on the day, every single member of staff was lovely and seemed genuinely like they wanted to help. Nothing was too much to ask. They really know how to provide great service. I won't spoil any surprises, but some of the services that come complimentary with your stay are just top notch as well.  The room was pristine and luxurious with an enormous bed and…"
July 2015,Treated like royalty!,"Hotel 41 was probably the loveliest hotel we have stayed in.  The staff were exceptional in so many ways. Knowing us by name right away, helping us with bookings and information about things to see and do, gracious service at the breakfasts and afternoon tea.  The room was so well appointed and spacious. A delicious birthday dessert in our room, a turn down at night with red roses and rose petals, plunder the pantry for late night snacking in the beautiful Executive Lounge.  We could go on and on.  The location across from Buckingham Palace is perfect!  I would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat!"
July 2015,Perfection,From the moment I walked in a could tell it would be a pleasant stay.   First thing they did was offer me some champagne while they explained the afternoon snacks setup.   The executive lounge was a great little cozy place to relax after getting in or before heading out.   Our room was very nice.  Spacious and clean.   The best thing about the hotel is their staff.   They all know you by name and bend over backwards to make sure your stay is as pleasant as can be.    There is no wonder this hotel is rated number 1; they definitely deserve it.  
July 2015,"Brilliant birthday treat, which was made by the truly wonderful staff, service and impeccable food and drink!","We stayed at Hotel 41 for a wonderful birthday surprise!   We arrived and were greeted with a beautiful glass (or two) of gorgeous champagne, and made to feel welcome in an instant! It is clear that the staff all love this place and their passion for service and hospitality is instantly apparent.  An upgrade on our room was just amazing and the room and facilities were first class! The bed, the bathrooms and complete ambience of this hotel makes it like a home from home, with all the luxury additions that you would expect from a hotel of this class.  All of our needs and expectations were met and exceeded! I cannot explain how wonderful this hotel is! A real experience!  Many many thanks! We will definitely be back!"
July 2015,Pampered,"We spent four wonderful nights at hotel 41 earlier this week. I can't say enough about how professional their staff is. They found a way to promptly satisfy every need and request we had, regardless of the time of day. We were two blocks from Buckingham Palace and treated like royalty.A unique experience. We will return there on our next trip to London. Truly a 5 star experience."
July 2015,The Best Of The Best,We stayed at Hotel 41 for two nights and this was the second time we have stayed at Hotel 41 in less than a year.  It is by far the finest hotel we have ever stayed at.  The staff is superb and takes care of everything and really goes all out to make every minute at the Hotel very special.  They are just so very friendly and attentive and I cannot think of any hotel that excels as much as this one does.  We enjoyed it so much we plan to be back next year.
July 2015,'Best Hotel experience by far',"Its difficult to find words to describe this hotel, as none i can think of are good enough. this was my 2nd visit and hopefully not my last. this time i brought my mum and sisters. The whole experience from the time we arrived to when we left was nothing short of amazing. ALL the staff treat you as if you are their most important guest, however a special mention must go to Lauren and of course Dickson, who just made our stay even more perfect. The Champagne afternoon tea was to die for. one of our party needed a special diet, all the staff were aware of this and we didn't need to ask, she had a separate afternoon tea that looked just as lush as ours.it is all the little touches that make this hotel the top hotel in London, (and beyond) it is everything in all previous reviews…"
July 2015,"Sorry, I didn't feel the love","I booked two rooms for my family of six at the Hotel 41. I chose this hotel based on the fabulous reviews posted here on TripAdvisor. Unfortunately, I didn't find that I was treated any better here than any other five- star properties I have stayed. I thought what set this hotel apart from other high end properties was the extra special personal attention one receives. My family and I were treated with kindness, and everyone was friendly and polite, but no extraordinary treatment was ever given. My family was celebrating my daughter's wedding and my husband's birthday. There was never any mention of this at the hotel. When I returned to the hotel from my outing, I struggled getting my granddaughter's stroller up the steps to the elevator. No one was around to help. I told the…"
July 2015,1st Class Hotel,"What a fabulous time I have just experienced at Hotel 41.  Their customer service is exemplary, and if you are lucky enough to stay at the hotel when Mr Jackson is on duty, then you will have found the jewel in your crown.  Hotel 41 is the perfect place to unwind and relax, it does not feel like a typical hotel, it feels more like being a member of an exclusive private club.    I cannot speak highly enough of Hotel 41 and their fabulous team, if you want to feel like royalty then this is the place to stay!  Breakfast is highly recommended.    Enjoy!"
May 2015,Simply stunning...x,"This hotel is pretty much as close to perfect as you can get. Unfortunately my stay was only one night but it was the most amazing evening and I wish I could have stayed longer.   From the minute you walk through the door you are treated like royalty, Roberta at reception was so kind and sweet. Manager Remus is a true gent, charming and professional, he lead us through to the lounge where we had a quick glass of champagne before he showed us to our room. The room was elegant and stylish, bed so comfy and bathroom stocked to the max with gorgeous toiletries.   We had breakfast in the morning in the lounge which was yummy, Dickson our server is probably the sweetest man on earth, perfectly accommodating and helpful. I honestly have nothing negative to say about this place, one of…"
July 2015,PERFECT ,This hotel is amazing!  The staff and incredible and really dote on the guests. This hotel is right across the street from the Royal Mews and a short walk to watch the Changing of the guards and the underground train. Great location.
July 2015,Exceptional,"This hotel breaks all the rules when it comes to exemplary service. They treat you like royalty from the time you book to the time you walk out the door. The rooms are well appointed but not huge by world standards. There is only 30 rooms in the boutique hotel and the staff help you believe you are the only guest that matters. The location is fantastic for walking to Buckingham Palace and just about anywhere else you want to go. I can not recommend them highly enough, but remember that this level of service and exclusivity does come at a price - however it is one I am willing to pay again. Just make sure you know the address when telling the cab drivers as it is a well kept secret and noone knew about it when we were travelling around (tell them it is next door to the Ruebens)"
June 2015,Like a Private Club,"We recently stopped over in London for 3 nights after a trip to Europe.  We totally enjoyed our stay at this outstanding hotel.  If you are expecting a grand lobby, multiple restaurants, hundreds of rooms and numerous amenities, you may be disappointed.  This is a small, say 30 room hotel, located within the Ruben's Hotel just across from the Buckingham Palace Mews.  It has the ambiance of a private club. The rooms and facilities are very nice and the location is perfect. What sets this hotel apart and made our stay very pleasant was quite simply the wonderful staff.  From our arrival to our departure the entire staff made our visit pleasant and enjoyable.  They provided excellent restaurant recommendations and tips on sightseeing. We would definitely return again."
June 2015,Impossible. ..,"It seems impossible to describe in words just how fabulous this hotel is.  From the moment you arrive,  you are treated as a special  guest.  Your favorite beverages are provided along with lovely appetizers.  The ""plunder the pantry"" option is the perfect way to end the evening.  Our room was spacious by London standards and furnished with every thing you might possibly need. The bathroom was quite spacious and light.   I left the hotel less than a week ago and already I miss Stefan,  Mitchell, and Dickson!  Thanks for making our stay so grand! "
June 2015,In a League Of Its Own!,"So after 8 years of using Tripadvisor to give me all the best tips and information for all my trips without ever giving back to the TA community through reviews of my own, a hotel has finally come along that has given my lazy self no choice but to post.    Hotel 41 is hands down the best hotel experience I have ever had.  Being a consultant, I have stayed at all the top branded 5 star properties and was truly blown away during my recent stay at Hotel 41 for my 1 yr anniversary. WOW!   Many have said it before me, but what sets Hotel 41 apart is their remarkable client service.  Every single hotel staff you encounter will be dedicated to providing the best service they are able to and make it look so effortless.  From the minute I stepped into the doors until the minute I left I…"
June 2015,An Outstanding Experience!,"Hotel 41 far exceeded my expectations!!  The staff was extremely helpful, the accommodations were beyond compare and the overall experience was more than worth the few extra dollars that it cost.  The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Parliament and many other sites.  I would stay there again."
March 2015,one of the best in London,this is so amazing. I really love it. the staffs are so professional. This is for the guests who love design and luxury style. facilities is so nice. I love everything about this hotel. I definitely come back here again soon.
May 2015,Wonderful Staff and Impeccable Service,"What a wonderful hotel. This is a real gem in London. It is the fifth floor of Ruben’s hotel (the converted ballroom), but it has its own private entrance and staff. We were a little concerned about the location (having previously stayed mainly in Kensington and Mayfair): it is close to Victoria Station, but also has another fine address close by in Buckingham Palace Road.  Although busy, the location was good, and it is only a few minutes’ walk to the underground. Our whole experience here was just perfect. From the time of arrival when you are met at the front door, whisked up the lift to the executive lounge where check-in is undertaken while drinking a lovely glass of champagne. Then escorted to your room where the luggage is already in place and a large bowl of fruit and…"
June 2015,Splendid! ! !,"The hotel is great!!!! I stayed for the second time and finally decided to give my review. Is one of those hotels that you don't mind what you'll pay at the end if the day. Because it deserves it all. Everything is so So SO amazing. The rooms,  the staff all the hotel areas and the location too. We were really glad that we had the chance to stay here again. We feel so lucky. That's what all the hotels should look and operate like. A stay will make you gain the same opinion. Thanks to the management and the staff for an unforgettable 2nd stay...!!!!"
June 2015,Marvelous one week stay,We spent the last week of May at Hotel 41 and was thrilled with our stay. The service was impeccable and we enjoyed the cosy boutique atmosphere of the establishment. All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly and we felt like home. We were able to get last minute tickets for plays and restaurant reservation. It goes to show that what makes a great hotel is the ground staff who runs the premise. It is a hotel that we will certainly look forward to stay when we next visit London. 
June 2015,High quality throughout,"Had a great visit last week, my first stay. Everything is just done to excellence. The rooms are absolute luxury as you would expect from a hotel of this rating. I will definitely be returning soon. The only thing I would do differently is stay longer."
June 2015,Simply the best hotel I have ever stayed in bar none!,"Without seeming to boast, I have stayed in some of the best hotels in over 45 countries and been blown away by a few, but nothing compares to 41. If like me you read the 'Terribles' first (Mostly for fun) you will understand that '41' is located on the 5th floor of the 'Rubens' hotel and has a separate entrance. No problem for us; in fact the uniqueness was intriguing and original which is always a good start. When you get to the lounge/reception, you enter a small club like environment and are welcomed by a choice of 4 champagnes whilst formalities are swiftly dealt with. You feel immediately welcome and individual.  You are looked after by genuine, engaging people (I cannot bring myself to call them staff) who really care that you enjoy your stay. If you are looking for the…"
May 2015,Magic Stay in London,"Just spent a magical 4 days in London at Hotel 41. From the very moment we crossed the threshold of the property, special moment after special moments were created. Mr. Hendry and his team were welcoming and so accommodating with every request. We celebrated my birthday and our Anniversary on this trip which was noted by the team in so may ways. Room upgrade, sweet birthday treats in the room, romantic rose petal turn down. WOW, WOW. Do not hesitate to book your stay here. After staying in many luxury hotels, I can honestly say that this was by far the best hotel stay ever. Looking forward to staying here and other Red Carnation properties. "
May 2015,My stay,Fantastic staff service hotel food quality everything we could of wished for and a surprise to us an upgrade just a delight I want to go back.the staff where exceptionally professional.  Kind attentive a joy to stay in this hotel
May 2015,Just perfect,"We stayed for only one night and I didn't want to leave!  It was a special occasion, 10 years since our first date and my husbands birthday and it was absolutely worth every single penny.  The team who work at Hotel 41 are lovely, attentive and unobtrusive.  The hotel is gorgeous with the executive lounge being at the heart of the hotel.  The snack bar/raid the pantry is a lovely touch and very nice to nibble on whilst you have a glass of wine/champagne sitting (or curled up like I was!) comfortably on one of the sofas.   The room was perfect, sumptuous and relaxing and the turndown service was just lovely - lots of little touches that make it memorable.  I didn't want to leave and a huge 'thank you' to the team for making our stay so special.  We will be back!"
May 2015,Anniversary Trip,"The hotel had such a welcoming atmosphere! Sure it is a smaller hotel but we felt that added to it's charm and uniqueness. We have only nice things to say about this hotel. It was our favorite by far during our 3 week trip. (We also visited Paris, Venice, and Rome). There is no other hotel that comes close to the personalized service you will get at Hotel 41. We will definitely stay here in the future and highly recommend it!"
May 2015,Pure indulgence,"Well what can I say except this hotel is amazing. We chose this hotel to spend our honeymoon and we were both completely blown away.  On arrival we were met and taken to the Executive Lounge to check in, during this time we were asked which champagne we would like to have whilst checking in. The atmosphere was relaxed and we had another glass and some snacks before being taken to our room.  Our room was sensational, everything was of an extremely high standard, could not fault a thing!! Truly perfect!!  We had asked for afternoon tea at 3pm,  we were both looking forward to it and again it exceeded our expectations, in fact we couldn't  finish all the cakes, so they kindly put them in a box for later!  The staff are all exceptional; they are both professional and friendly, we…"
May 2015,Spoil yourself ,We stayed 3 nights in April. Everything that has been said in previous reviews is true. The hotel is 5 star but difference is the number of rooms. With only 60 people staying in house at any one time the staff have the time to stop and talk and to help in any small way they can. Nothing is too much trouble and make sure that you have high tea one afternoon. It is fantastic. 
May 2015,i can't imagine a better hotel !,"This is simply the best hotel you Can imagine. Everybody is so friendly and unbelievable friendly. Noting you ask is to much. The decoration and look of the hotel is beautiful. Our room was very big for London standards. The executive lounge is so comfortable , with al the free snacks and delicious cocktails. Lamine makes the best Mai Tais ever ! I had about 8 of them en Lamine was my new best friend ;-) This was our sixth hotel in London but from now on we will keep coming back here because you get the feelings that al the staff are your friends en we miss them already :-)."
May 2015,An incredibly impressive hotel,"We first stayed in 41 a few years ago and experienced a level of service far beyond anything we had previously encountered, we had a wonderful stay and enjoyed every moment.  Naturally for our next London stay we chose 41 but I can remember being worried that our first visit was a 'one off' and that we could possibly be disappointed, amazingly it just seemed to be even better which I thought would be impossible.......we have recently returned from our fifth stay and this hotel never fails to impress, this latest stay was just amazing. As always upon arrival we were warmly greeted, Monika ( who is lovely and extremely good at her job) booked us in making sure we had everything we needed . Then as always the service was excellent from everyone, I'm sorry not to be able to remember…"
March 2015,wonderfuuuuul!!!,travelling to london was an experience of a lifetime! wonderfull place!! hotel 41 is the perfect hotel in order to have the best accomondation! we stayed there  week and we had one fore free!! it was the best choice i ever had!!!
April 2015,Very disappointed,This hotel did not live up to our expectations at all. We stayed here for three nights based on it being number 1 on TripAdvisor but I'm sorry fellow travellers and reviewers I just don't understand how the hotel gets the rating.  We stayed in a junior suite with an unnecessary television room downstairs. The bathroom was tiny and the room felt cramped and uncomfortable. I emailed staff prior to our stay on a weekend but because they were only working during the week didn't get a response for two days. Whilst there we asked staff to book a restaurant for us for lunch the next day at 12.30pm  only to turn up and find out the booking had not been made. When we returned to the room a couple of hours later we were called by staff to let us know they couldn't get us in at 12.30 but…
December 2014,top notch,"the attention is 5 star really, everything about this is pure class, it embraces the experience of the city inside its walls, the staff takes care of every detail and are really helpful, the rooms are stunning as well."
May 2014,Top Class,"So glad we chose to stay here it really is fantastic ,service is brilliant very kind and highly professional. Don't bother going elsewhere ,it's almost like having your own private stylish London residence in town. Excellent all round"
April 2015,Excellent Service and Great Location,"We were not familiar with this gem of a hotel when we booked it but they exceeded our expectations!  The entire staff including Monica, Remus, Gina, Julianna & Norbert to name a few made us feel at home during our stay.  The little details such as warm towels, turndown service, great snacks in the lounge as well as the service, location and attention to every need made us sad when it was time to leave.  We felt like family at this wonderful property.  The last minute assistance with theater tickets which were hand delivered to me, made me feel special and appreciated.  Thanks to the team at Hotel 41, our first London visit will not be our last!  Tom S"
April 2015,Unbelievable service!,"Based on the No. 1 rating on Trip Advisor, we decided to stay here for a few days following my wife's 50th birthday rather than fly abroad. We had very high expectations but these were not only met but exceeded on many occasions. We have never received service that is so good and so sincere anywhere else. I can only liken this to staying at the home of a  good friend who goes out of their way to make you feel comfortable and welcome in their home. There were so many things that made this special. From the time we arrived and were offered a choice of champagne from the champagne trolley to the time we checked out and were offered bottles of water for the journey as it was hot,  we were made to feel very special. We were surprised that a member of staff who we spoke to when we…"
April 2015,deserve to be treated like royalty,"Hotel 41 in London is an experience that everyone needs to have once in a lifetime if not many times over. The staff treated each and every person with high respect and made your stay feel like home. Each staff member knew your name and always asked about our days adventures.  Staying in the Conservatory Suite was amazing. We thank the staff for the roses, lit candles and rose petals on our return one evening - so romantic. We Will be back!"
May 2014,Amazing stay in London,"Little did I know that this trip was the trip my now husband was going to propose on. This hotel is in an amazing location and the service was incredible! Extremely comfortable rooms, and the staff was very helpful with making recommendations and getting reservations for dinner, theater etc. I definitely want to stay here again when I come back to London."
April 2015,Distinctly average,"This is not a 5 star hotel. I don't understand why it's so highly rated. We came here for our anniversary based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews but I was really disappointed. It is VERY small and very dark; the lobby, the lift, the rooms... small enough to claustrophobic. The lounge is a nice respite from all the closed in dark spaces but still too small for me to properly relax. No pool, no spa, no gym...  The staff are very helpful - really lovely even, but this is just not a 5 star hotel."
April 2015,home-away-from-home,"Our second visit here. We just love this little gem. The location is great. The staff and all the special touches adds to making this our first choice when staying in London. A beautiful lounge area, here you can find the best cuppa with all kinds of treats during the day. Breakfast is wonderful too."
April 2015,James Bond Might Hang His Hat Here,"We were in London for business and we started our stay at a traditional hotel in Chelsea for several days....deciding to upgrade our experience the final three days at Hotel 41.  This is the hotel for you if you seek top-notch service, elegant surroundings, and a central location for sightseeing. If it wasn't so pleasurable, it might be embarrassing to have so many staff members so warmly intent at meeting your every wish. As an example, we were enjoying a glass of champagne in the candle-lit lounge when I accidentally tipped over my champagne glass, breaking it and giving me a tiny cut in the process.  Within 60 seconds, our tabletop had been cleaned, I had a new glass of champagne in my hand, and I was wearing a bandage on my finger.  It was such a whirl of activity, I can't…"
April 2015,A hidden gem of London!,"The service at this hotel was the best I've experienced in Britain. Every staff member called me by name and were extremely friendly and polite. I had a wonderful experience at this hotel.  The hotel location was excellent, the rooms were nice and my overall experience was wonderful."
May 2015,Excellent service as usual.,"I have had the pleasure of staying at 41 on a number of occasions now and the level of hospitality is always excellent.  It's quite important to understand what this hotel is, and what it is not when looking to book.  This is not a large hotel with statement lobby and public areas, spa, gym and restaurants on site. There are plenty of other 5 stars options in London to meet these requirements.  This is a place to walk around in your slippers, a cross between  a private club and your own home with exceptional hospitality. Perfect for my own needs.  There is still some building work going on in the area which can be a little intrusive so it's best to check the very latest situation with the hotel. I did comment on the noise level and Moniker acted immediately to remove some…"
May 2015,#1 Hotel in London Exceeds Expectations,"I stayed here for 3 nights and I had a group of 9 people booked on this trip (we had 9 rooms). Customer service is their mantra! From the moment we walked in to the moment we checked out, every single detail, things you don't even think of, were taken care of. You can call room service for coffee and it was pretty much at your room before you even hung up the phone.  Room: the size of the room isn't large but much larger than you would expect being in prime location across the Royal Mews. Very clean, orderly and the most comfortable bed and pillows I've experienced in a while.  Food: quality of food and the service at the lounge was great. I really enjoyed their breakfast.   Executive Lounge: this is where you come to relax, eat, drink or have a quiet chat. This lounge was the…"
April 2015,"Small size, great service and comfort","This gem across from the Royal Mews offers first class service from all the staff, top to bottom.  No question or request is too small.  Our room, though not large, was luxurious and had every thoughtful amenity, and the bath with large tub and large shower was elegantly fitted out.  Highly recommended if you love a small, quiet hotel with top notch personal service."
January 2015,Superb again,"There is a reason why this is the best hotel in London, the staff. Every member of staff from the concierge to the maintenance man offers the unobtrusive excellence in customer service that other larger establishments can only dream of. Our second visit, this time for my birthday, last year was for my husbands birthday, I cannot recommend Hotel 41 highly enough and we are already planning next years visit"
May 2015,Simply the Best,"We have stayed at 41 for a number of years now on our frequent trips to London. This boutique luxury hotel is a gem.   Quite simply the best at personal service, atmosphere, and luxury.  Mr. Hendry's staff raises the bar on service to levels rarely experienced in any field these days.  The rooms are unique due to the nature of the building, and some reviews commenting upon size are unfair. The architecture, decor, and feel is that of London.  This is not a large property, and the small number of rooms allow for an intimate feeling of a personal club.  The staff focus on your personal wishes with discrete service that exceeds all expectations.  Every need is attended with professionalism and friendliness.  We can't wait to return!"
April 2015,"Excellent service,ambience & anticipation","I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. I cant speak highly enough of the staff & their anticipation of my needs. Being a single middle aged traveller I was looked after incredibly well. The staff seemed to anticipate what I needed & action it to make such a wonderful stay. From the beautiful breakfasts to the liesurely late afternoon drinks in the lounge, everything was perfect. The rooms are very comfortable & to return after a busy day, to sliced lemon, lime, olives & a bucket of ice & fresh water bottles was just brilliant.Just nothing was too much trouble, the best discreet, friendly service I have ever encountered at some of the finest hotels. Congratulations to the staff & management for making my stay such a wonderful experience."
April 2015,A relaxing oasis in busy London,"We recently stayed four nights at Hotel 41. When we travel we usually do not spend much time in our hotel, but the care and friendly attention we received at ""41"" enticed us to return each day.  The staff is outstanding (thank you Malcolm, Lauren, Monika and everyone whose name I cannot remember) and they all deserve the rave reviews they have received from other guests.  Every question, request or whim is treated seriously and responded to immediately.  After a long day of travel to London it was delightful to be offered a glass of chilled champagne while our bags were taken to our room.  Our executive king room was roomy (particularly for a European city hotel), comfortable, and extremely quiet.  The location between Buckingham Palace (across the street) and Victoria Station…"
April 2015,We very much liked this hotel,"We recently had the pleasure of spending three nights at Hotel 41.  The hotel is very well located across the street from Buckngham Palace.  The service could not have been better and the staff was friendy and very accomodating.  We give this ony 4 stars because of the size of the room, and the lack of a lobby at street level, but we would highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again when we return to London."
December 2014,The Mini Moon of our dreams,"My new husband and I wanted to spend a couple of special days together immediately after our Christmas Wedding (December 2014). London was our choice and we were given many recommendations from friends but we really wanted to stay at a boutique hotel and found some great reviews for 41. How could we resist 'the most romantic hotel in London'? Our two nights at 41 were the highlight of our year and the most fantastic stay we've ever had at a hotel. The most perfect way to start our married life together. My husband and I were blown away by the wonderful service and attention to detail, from every single member of staff. We were addressed by name by everyone at all times and the welcome was lovely, with a glass of champagne. Nothing was too much trouble. We loved how the staff…"
April 2015,Nothing short of perfection,"Can I add anything to the excellent reviews already provided? No, not really but I feel that I am obliged to share our excellent stay with those who might be considering staying at the 41 - consider no further and go for it. You are very welcome there, genially welcome. Some of the rooms might be a bit on the small side (ours was great) but very well appointed and cater to needs you didn´t know you had. The staff is the best you come around in the hospitality business - nothing is to much ask, and by some miracle they manage to exceed the high expectations one has after reading the reviews. I read a small booklet they have on the RCH and as I understand the founder is very keen on her guests feeling special and happy about their stay. Well, Mrs Tollman, if you read this (which I…"
January 2015,Highly Recommended,"Amazing place, good food, nice staff and beautiful location. Unfortunately we stayed here only a night and all we wanted was to stay here more. They recommended a sightseeing tour to us which was a good idea. The laundry is fast and efficient. The service always came with a smile. The beds are very comfortable and pillows are very soft. We were a group of four stay here in two interconnected rooms. We did not eat here but I am sure that they serve excellent food as their menu looks very promising.  It is good value of money at the same time a nice retreat for a much needed break."
May 2015,Best Hotel Service Ever,"Our recent visit to Hotel 41 in London was nothing short of amazing. From the moment we arrived we immediately felt at home due to the absolutely incredible hotel staff that went out of the way to make sure our stay was a splendid one. From the front desk staff to the lounge and dining (Stefan had some wonderful stories and we miss him already) everything was world class. The rooms were spacious and quiet and had all the amenities one could possibly need. Next time you visit London please do yourself a favor and have the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41, you will be happy you did!"
May 2015,5 Star Luxsury with the feel of a B&B,I could not add much to all of the wonderful reviews of this Hotel. It is finds like this property that make Trip Advisor so great. They truly are a trusted source. We are a well traveled couple and this might have been one of the most comfortable experiences for us ever. I have never felt more welcomed or comfortable at a hotel. There was not anything we asked for that was not provide with an incredible sense of pleasure to be of service. The staff to guest ratio is incredible. The rooms are not large but very comfortable and well appointed. We had reserved a suite but we're also upgraded to a slightly larger suit with 2 full bathrooms. That was a real plus. If you want the big hotel experience this is not the place for you. If you want the very best personal service that you…
May 2015,THE best hotel in London,"My third visit to 41 and the most special yet.  Having saved up over the last few months, we booked the Conservatory Suite, A Night under the Stars.  We arrived early at around 12 noon and were welcomed in her usual wonderful way by Lauren in the Executive Lounge.  A glass of rose champagne started of our luxurious visit and we decided to stay in the lounge to have a light lunch before leaving for the theatre.  As our suite was not ready for us (which we knew that it wouldn't be) we were offered a courtesy room to get refreshed.  We returned after seeing ""Gypsy"" at the Savoy Theatre (thoroughly recommend it) and, after arranging with Remus what time we would like to go up on the roof, were shown to our suite.  The ground level had been converted into a small dining area for our…"
April 2015,Amazing !,"Wanted to treat ourselves to a great hotel in London for a couple of days, and picked the 41. Did not regret it for one second ! Was given a royal treatment from the moment we stepped inside this beautiful property. At the check-in counter we were offered a glass of champagne, we ended up emptying a bottle waiting for our room (we came with an early flight, so the 41 not to blame for the wait) All members of the staff very friendly and helping us with all our needs. Free afternoon snack very welcome after a long day walking in not too comfy boots ! Second night when we came back the room was turned into a romantic haven with rose pedals and candle-lights - adorable ! The heart of the hotel is a combined reception, bar and eating area that works very well. Our room was spacious…"
May 2015,Amazing place,"This hotel is just wow, on arrival I got the warmest welcome from reception and given the lowdown on the building and surrounding areas. My room was nice and spacious and extremely comfy. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, I am pretty sure if I had asked for a dancing elephant with bells on it they would have tried their hardest to accomodate it. Seriously tho my stay in London was made perfect to the whole team here and I will be back. Oh I must mention, the whiskey I was given (I had to wait a few mins for check in) was absolutely stunning, I wish I had asked what it was."
May 2015,Absolutely the best hotel. Hands down,"I join the THOUSANDS of happy reviewers who think this was an experience unlikely to be repeated elsewhere. And along with everyone else not that the staff made this great. How did they find these people? I have never felt so taken care of ! You feel like you are part of an exclusive secret club, there isn't even a sign for the hotel outside. My mother and I were in 4103 with a view over towards Buckingham Palace, but despite being on the main road the room was silent. Interesting bonus feature: they have instant hot water and amazing water pressure. This may sound like a weird thing to compliment, but after 10 days in Italy with wimpy showers this was heavenly. I learned from a previous reviewer to check with Costco Travel and this turned out to be GREAT advice! The bonus add…"
May 2015,Outstanding!! ,Another amazing visit to the 41!  There just isn't a finer spot to stay if you value outstanding customer service. The room was absolutely stunning and the use of the private club lounge is unparalleled. The 41 team even arranged a private rooftop champagne viewing of the VE Day flyover.    There is a reason this place is ranked the top.  They work very hard for it and it shows.  
May 2015,A haven from the hustle and bustle of London.,I hope the staff at 41 realise how much their attention to their customers and the thoughtful detail to what is provided is appreciated. When one spends much of ones life looking after others needs it is so good to be look after in such a caring way for two days oneself. Thank you all at 41.
May 2015,Simply the best!!,"I stayed at this hotel for 1 night and loved it. Everything from the personal welcome on arrival, to the complimentary drinks and snacks, and the amazing 'executive lounge', was excellent. Hotel 41 is very well located across the street from Buckingham Palace and 1 block from the underground station, making it a great place to explore London. The hotel feels small and personal, and the staff are incredible friendly, attentive knowledgeable and courteous. Our room was wonderful with an extremely comfortable bed and a huge bath plus separate walk-in shower. All the staff went out of their way to make sure there was nothing lacking, incredibly attentive, knowledgeable and courteous. The breakfast was delivered into our room at agreed time; it was absolutely delicious (you must try…"
March 2015,Unforgettable Stay,"I had booked this hotel to propose my other half. I contacted the hotel several months in advance to see if they could assist me with arranging the music, roses, get our favorite champagne in the room and deal with numerous other details I was trying to get together. Their response from the start was amazing - every single thing was exactly how I had hoped for. They went for that extra mile by putting together a sound system that worked for my music - they didn't have this in place initially.  We got upgraded to a stunning room that was on two levels, had a lovely sitting area downstairs with a fire place and then bedroom and bathroom upstairs. Very large, super-comfy bed and two separate showers & large bath tub.  When we returned in the evening they had set everything ready as…"
February 2015,Best stay in the heart of London,"We were spending a weekend i London, and Hotel 41 was a perfect choice both because of its location and the ""boutique"" interior. We were welcome with the glass of champagne by the friendly and professional stuff. The room was big enough and the bathroom very comfortable. Gorgeous classical interior of the launch was just a prick over ""i"". Loved everything!"
March 2015,Two Nights of Indulgence,"Spent 2 nights here with my wife over the weekend and had an amazing time. The hotel feels small and personal, and the staff are incredible friendly, attentive knowledgeable and courteous.   Our room was wonderful with an extremely comfortable bed and a huge bath plus separate walk-in shower.  We really enjoyed the welcome drinks, the pantry and the honesty bar. Breakfast was excellent.  Location-wise its practically next door to Buckingham Palace so a great place to explore London from.   We have also stayed at The Ritz and The Savoy and this place is definitely up there with them, but with a bit more of a personal touch."
March 2015,Wonderful Experience!!,"My mother and I stayed at Hotel 41 for 3 days while we were visiting London and it was such an incredible experience. The room was delightful and large enough to accommodate both of us comfortably, the food was delicious, and above all, the service level provided by the staff was unparalleled. The staff is genuine, kind, incredibly attentive, and warm. They went out of their way to assist us with any needs we had (even going to lengths of going to the Starbucks down the street and picking out a mug as a souvenir for a friend when all I asked was if they could see if there was a Starbucks in the airport terminal) and to ensure that our stay was as pleasant and care free as possible. I really looking forward to returning to Hotel 41 and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a…"
March 2015,Wonderful Birthday Weekend,"Cannot speak highly enough of this hotel. Everything about it was perfect. The service was exemplary - nothing was too much trouble. The room was fantastic, every detail covered. It was the little things that made it though.... The birthday cake in the room, the upgrade to a suite for our special occasion, the champagne on arrival, the lit fire when we returned to our room in the evening and the complementary tea and scones just before we left for our return journey. We WILL be back!!!!"
February 2015,"Beautiful Accommodation, Great Location, Wonderful Staff","My wife and I spent four days last month at Hotel 41 in London, and very much look forward to returning!  Our room was attractive and comfortable.  The lounge was a great respite after a day of sightseeing and shopping with plenty to eat and drink.  The location was ideal whether walking, hailing a cab, or taking the Tube.  The staff was incredibly attentive, friendly, and helpful, whether with restaurant recommendations, directions, or virtually any question asked.  And they were wonderful to simply have a conversation with as well.  We had let them know in advance we were celebrating our anniversary and were very pleasantly surprised to find a celebratory cake awaiting us on arrival, as well as scattered rose pedals and votive candles throughout the room after dinner our first…"
March 2015,A little gem,"Seleted Hotel 41 from Tripadvsor reviews and I can confirm it justly deserves its position on the list.On arrival were speedily shown to the 5th floor executive lounge where the check in process is completed.Whilst we were being checked in we were offered a choice of champagne .We then spent some time enjoying the ambiance off he executive lounge with complementary nibbles and more champagne.When we were ready we were shown to our room 4104 the conservatory suite.Everything in the suite was explained to us nothing was rushed .The suite was incredible , arranged over 2 floors with a sitting room on the lower level with a nice couch a mini bar and TV also a toilet.On the upper floor a massive bedroom with the conservatory roof so you can sleep under the stars or close the blinds…"
March 2015,Fabulous and Personal,"Thank you so much to Hotel 41 for an amazing stay over my birthday.  The room was stunning and made even more so with the fire and rose petals in the evening!  Made our stay so special with all those personal touches, including theatre merchandise, roses, our fav magazines and a birthday cake!  Breakfast was absolutely delicious, were still talking about it.  Will definitely be coming back and recommending to friends and family alike!"
March 2015,Cozy and Fabulous,"I have just spent a week in this  gorgeous Hotel. It is perfect in every way! The staff make this  hotel, they cannot do enough to spoil you. The rooms are beautifully appointed and the breafasts are gorgeous! I could list far more than 41 reasons to stay! Just book you won't be dissapointed!"
February 2015,Fantastic service and stay ,"Stayed here with the other half, we both thoroughly enjoyed our time here. Service was fantastic and someone was always there when required. Room service efficient and not intrusive. The whole decor of the place was amazing felt as if we was in a different country and not in London. This is one of the best hotels in London at the moment. Will be back again in the summer. Thanks "
April 2015,My FAVORITE Hotel ever!,"We travel a lot and stay at lots of great places but this is the BEST experience I can remember having.  If you like to cruise and know the personal attention you receive from your attendants - this is similar.  The staff is amazing and couldn't do enough to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.  From the all day ""snack bar"" and drinks to rose petals and lit candles in our room - I can't think of one more thing they could have done.  I especially liked how even the tv remote and remote to the fireplace were in plastic sleeves marked sanitized.  They even have snacks packed for you to take with you on your long day tours.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone.  Wifi and breakfast every day made me feel like I wasn't getting charged for every incidental.  Hi Tea is a must if you…"
April 2015,The best hotel ever!!,"Everything is amazing at Hotel 41 - very professional, attentive and friendly members of staff, perfect service, great room and executive loundge, complimentary drink on arrival and complimentary food all day long and very personalised sevice full of surprises!! Thank you so much for making us feel so special - Stéphanie and Olivier"
April 2015,Another outstanding visit,"We stayed at the Hotel 41 three years ago and decided to return for another family vacation based on the fantastic service we had the last time.  I did not think it was possible that they could have exceeded our previous experience...but they did!  Monika, Florent, and the entire staff bent over backwards to make sure we had a wonderful holiday in London.   They truly pampered us and went out of their way to accommodate any request we had.  I can not say enough about this great boutique hotel in a prime area of the city."
April 2015,Exceptional,"We have never written a review on TA before; however, we felt that the fantastic experience we had at Hotel 41 was worth sharing. After being escorted to check –in, the staff were polite and friendly, affording us with their undivided attention. Prior to arrival we had put on our preferences form that our little stay at the hotel was a “mini-moon”, in response to this information the staff informed us that we would receive a complimentary upgrade to a suite, which was unexpected and a lovely surprise. The glasses of champagne that were served before going to our room enhanced the experience further.   The trip continued in this manner…  Both the Executive Lounge and the suite were immaculately clean and well-presented. The suite was wonderfully spacious and the two bathrooms…"
March 2015,"Wow, Wow, Wow amazing","Hotel 41 where do I start? Check in- 10/10 superb a complimentary glass of bubbles Room -10/10 was given an upgrade words can not  describe how lovely that was, fresh fruit, water, robes, slippers, everything you could possible want. The hotel offers complimentary drinks between 6-8pm the service is fantastic and your glass is never empty.  The complimentary food is fantastic so much to choose from hot and cold with deserts choices as well, again the service is second to none. The lounge area is very relaxing, with free wifi, papers magazines everything you could wish for, We were celebrating a very special occasion and when we returned to the room, there were candles lit, rose petals scattered around the room, soft music playing and a celebration cake provided, we certainly…"
January 2015,Wow -  A place I recommend to  friends,"When I stay in London, I stay at Hotel 41 - right across from Buckingham Palace. The staff is always excellent, they always help me get the best play tickets as well as dinner reservations at great restaurants. The rooms are spacious and cozy lounge is a great place to unwind after a busy day in the city. I have found the location to be excellent, coupled with excellent staff this is place in London I recommend to friends."
April 2015,Amazing Service,Spent the Eastern week end (3 nights) at the 41.  Fantastic service in a very cosy atmosphere.  The concierge booked us different London restaurant reservation with great attention and professionalism. I went to run with one of the team member who guided me in the different parks. The team has always a lot of attention for the guests.  Can only recommand it. Very weel located close to buckingham.
May 2014,Great customer service,"We were welcomed at door step and led to check in at the counter. Got a free champagne as the welcome drink. Room looks lovely and very clean. Traditional english style. First time received notes about the weather for the next day and recommendation of places to visit. Felt very good to see these little things done by the hotel. Well done! Staffs are very friendly and attentive, but for couples like my husband and I, we didn't really enjoy the attention. Overall, good quality room and service! Location is good too as we walk to most places for touristy visits."
March 2015,"In a world of fine hotels, this one stands out as one of the very best.","To celebrate a special birthday, a small group of friends traveled to London leaving husbands and families behind in the US.  I travel worldwide regularly for work.   To say that this was the finest service I have ever experienced is an understatement.  It is almost impossible to describe.    More important than the actual service was the sincerity expressed by the entire staff.  From the daily pillow choices, to the thought and attention to every detail- large or tiny- nothing was left to chance.   I would imagine leaders of countries do not  experience this type of attention and comfort.   Hotel 41 is a gem.  I will be back.   Nancy.    April, 2015."
March 2015,"Superb, attentive staff make hotel 41 magic","From the champagne reception to numerous other personal touches which went above and beyond our expectations, the  staff really make hotel 41 a special place to stay. We went away for a romantic night away and it was perfect. Thoroughly recommend this place and worth  every penny"
January 2015,Home away from Home- Perfection!,"From the warm, welcoming staff to the delightful ""nibbles"" always available, to the beautiful decor, this hotel felt more like a bed and breakfast. It is a short walk to Buckingham Palace and a quick jaunt to the Tube station. This wonderful hotel is absolutely delightful in every way, and we will not stay anywhere else from now on!"
January 2015,A wonderfully relaxing time,"Possibly the best hotel stay I have ever had whether for business or pleasure. Incredibly attentive, friendly and welcoming staff. Super comfy bed (always important even for one night!) and nice bedroom.  We could have whiled away the whole of Sunday reading the papers by the fire in the Executive Lounge. Will definitely be returning."
January 2015,Unbelievable Service. Perfect stay. Beautiful and Clean.,"I've stayed at the Intercontinental, the Sheraton Park Lane, the Cavendish St. James and a number of others. Nothing compares to the level of service you'll find at this wonderful, cozy and friendly hotel. Everything was clean and in order and the accommodations were excellent in every respect. Great location too. Thanks so much to the awesome staff. Nice job!"
January 2015,The Best Hotel in 25 Years of Travel,"The experience of ""41"" begins with a warm welcome from the Concierge and your car whisked away for parking, The reception by the hotel staff is second to none, very attentive and exceptionally polite. Our stay was to celebrate my partners birthday, the room was wonderful, a small piece of cake was a thoughtful gesture and the flowers ordered were of good quality. The ambience is wonderful it is like apartment living with the lounge the main gathering place. All requested reservations had been made and nothing too much trouble. The afternoon tea was really good, a great selection of sandwiches, pastries and scones.  Above all every staff member was so polite, addressed you by name and a great asset to this hotel. For anyone wanting the best hotel experience in London this is the…"
January 2015,Fantastic,"One of the best hotel I've nevere used. fantastic, with an excellent service and romantic room. The hotel is near to all major famous places of London. A perfect location to start to visiting and living London."
December 2014,"Small, Personable Stay","We stayed at Hotel 41 the week between Christmas and New Years Eve. The rooms were elegant and clean (but watch your head in the loft if you're very tall!). The staff were all exceedingly friendly and helpful, making arrangements and suggestions each night of our visit. Because it's a small hotel, you quickly feel as though the staff knows you. For example, each time we left the hotel on an outing that the staff helped arrange, someone at the door recognized us and handed us an envelop with printed walking directions and (if needed) confirmations. Very handy!  The location was also perfect. We would definitely stay at Hotel 41 again!"
May 2014,One of the best,"I've been fortunate enough to stay in some amazing hotels around the world, but few are as personable and memorable as 41.  You'll be greeted with champagne, treated like an individual rather than a room number, and lavished with incredible luxury throughout your stay. Pricey (as expected), but worth it."
January 2015,Simply Stunning ....,"Wow,  just returned from two nights at 41,  it is a truly a stunning hotel.  The Staff are friendly, attentive and nothing is too much. I have been fortunate enough to stay in some great hotels but none as good as 41.  The location is great for travelling round London and despite being next to the main road it is quiet.  no road noise, no doors banging and then there is the food,  just fab with a great pantry that is worth visiting.  a lot of other hotels could do with visiting 41 and just learning what hospitality is about.  my thanks to all the staff who looked after us. Highly recommended"
January 2015,Amazing,"I stayed here as a birthday treat for my girlfriend on 24/1/15 and could not have picked a better choice. There is not one thing about this hotel that could be improved and I will certainly be staying here again, I felt like a celebrity from start to finish!  Highly recommend!"
December 2014,Feels like home!,"This was our 3rd Christmas at 41 and we really didn't want to leave, so much so that we ended up extending our stay.  Special mention to Lauren, Monika and Florent for making the stay so memorable and fun, but the whole 41 team as always were fantastic.  They make you feel like returning friends rather than guests and had organised a lovely anniversary surprise for us in the room when we checked in. Consistently excellent service and the best hotel beds we've ever slept in!  41's location is great, it's just a short walk through the park to some great shopping streets and an excuse to feed the local squirrels! Can't wait for next Christmas!"
February 2015,Outstanding!,"The location of this hotel is excellent. It's within short walking distance of Buckingham Palace and not far from Parliament Square. Easy walking distance (5 minutes or so) to Victoria Station. Gatwick Express takes 30 minutes and is about 40 pounds for 2 people.   The service at the hotel is exemplary. The ""whatever, wherever"" philosophy lives up to the highest expectations. Staff are ready and willing to assist at any time.   Continental breakfast was nice and also the option to order off the menu. 24 hour room service is available. Great snacks in the afternoon and in the evening as well in the executive lounge.   The bed was comfy and rooms were large for European standards. We used our sound machine (which we use at home) and didn't find noise to be a problem. Higher end…"
February 2015,This place is in a league of its own,"Just returned from a short stay the night before Valentine's Day.  My wife and I have stayed in most of the best hotels in London; this place is in a league of its own.  -Without exception, the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.  Not American style feigned obsequiousness in search of a large tip, not intrusive over the top badgering, just genuinely nice and happy people.   -The main dining room/lounge area had an incredibly relaxing vibe.  Imagine an old style stately home library with, during the day, the gently soothing music of a spa and at nighttime, equally relaxing piano jazz.  My wife and I arrived after a longish journey intent on checking in, going to our room, and not emerging until the morning - this place draws you in, and we ended up quite happily staying…"
February 2015,Five Star Gem,A five star gem in Victoria next to Buckingham Palace We could not fault this hotel it is absolutely amazing the staff are so friendly and welcoming and you feel like your meeting close friends. Nothing is any trouble and all the staff are charming The food and service is amazing the room is spotlessly clean and has a wonderful decor you feel like you're stepping back in time into a bygone age thank you to everyone for making our Valentine and Our10th anniversary so amazing we can't wait to come back and see you all again .The room was beautifully decorated for Valentine with lit candles and rose petals and it was so beautiful to come back too in the evening   Once again thank you to everyone for all their help and wonderful service we will see you all very soon thank you from…
February 2015,Valentines weekend,"From the moment you get into this hotel the staff are perfect so polite so nice so helpful and nothing too much trouble, we stayed in room 4107 which is a very nice and comfortable room, when we got back to our room on Valentines evening there was a lovely red rose petals on the bed and lit candles a bottle of massage oil , fabulous small boutique five star hotelwe we will be back lots of love chris & roy xx"
February 2015,Perfect Boutique Hotel!,"Charming, sophisticated, cozy, unique - then add excellent service - beyond what you could even think possible - and you have 41 Hotel.  Just one floor full of rooms with a staff that is ready and willing to accommodate your every request.  They send you a pre-arrival form and I requested a birthday cake as a surprise for my husband and some roses.  I was then asked what type of cake, what did I want written on it, and when did I want it delivered - extremely detail oriented!  When we arrived from our dinner out that evening, our room was lit up with candles in each part of our room (including the bathroom) surrounded by rose petals, a delicious chocolate mousse cake (small, as requested), and beautiful turn down service.  I love that they put a hot water bottle between the…"
February 2015,Wow!!!,"If you are wondering where to stay in London this is the place. Service, Accommodation, Clean, Very Comfortable, all top notch one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. Executive lounge suite is a real treat. Cannot wait to go back . Well done to all staff you do a fantastic job."
January 2015,Perfect weekend stay in London,"My wife and I went to London for a weekend to celebrate her birthday. From the first second we were greeted with an amazing personal service and complimentary champagne. In the room awaited a complimentary birthday cake and a handwritten card. The room was delightful, with a good sized bathroom (not common in London.) The Lounge was elegant and cozy at the same time.  The staff was very helpful and attentive. They also helped obtain musical tickets and restaurant reservations beforehand. Plenty of small amazing details everywhere ensured a memorable stay in London. We are definitely coming back."
February 2015,"Delightful, best hotel ever","From the moment we arrived we felt very special, the attention to detail is second to none. I have been the hospitality sector for over thirty years, these people have had the best training and make each person feel at home.  They have the knack of just making you feel special and that they appreciate that you chose to book your stay with them.  I had a problem with my Mother that I had not realised had got worse before we arrived and they went way beyond what that should have or had to do, to ensure that our special time together was unforgettable.  It is truly a jewel in the crown and will always stay here when I visit London.   The price may seem high but you will know that it is every penny well spent.  Thank you all again for our magical stay"
November 2014,Shocked and more shocked,This hotel met all our needs. We stayed in the executive king suite. The bed was comfortable and soft. A little softer then I would like but I slept like a baby. Location was perfect. Close to Buckingham palace and tunnels. The staff was very educated of the history and area. The breakfast is a must! It was deligjtful . It could of been cleaner as I did come across some hair in bed and the shower. Over all it was a wonderful experience and we can't wait to return 
January 2015,Outstanding in every way,"What a wonderful hotel this is ! My husband and I recently spent the weekend here . A lovely warm welcome as we entered the hotel even though we had arrived quite early , the staff were so friendly and attentive throughout our stay . Amazing to get a choice of champagnes at check in , followed by canapés whilst our room was ready .  The executive lounge is so relaxing and homely and was never really busy or noisy , such a difference to the many London hotels we have stayed in .  We had booked an executive king room and found this to be a perfect size , nice big bath and separate shower , beautifully furnished and spotlessly clean . The bed was extremely comfortable and the choice of pillows included an aromatherapy one which I highly recommend . Breakfast in the lounge was…"
January 2015,Best service I've ever experienced,"The hotel is comfortable, well decorated and reasonably well positioned in Victoria. What sets it apart is the service. It's amazing. I travel a lot with work and have stayed in excellent hotels all over the World. This really stands out. They anticipate your needs and are generous with their champagne, snacks and excellent coffee. They are also friendly and very helpful. We had a wonderful time."
December 2014,Stunning luxury!!,I first wrote a review on Hotel 41 about 4 or 5 years ago and could not stop recommending it to everyone that I knew.  We had the opportunity to return in December whilst doing some Christmas shopping in London and it is as magnificent as ever!  We stayed in a Junior Suite and I would like to share our experiences as follows: Location:  Hotel 41 is situated in Buckingham Palace Road and is just around the corner from Buckingham Palace.  We never caught cabs anywhere as it is so easy to walk to places such as Hyde Park and Harrods.  Longer walks would include walking to Fortnum and Mason - totally lovely! The staff:  We had not been there for two years and were so happy to see familiar faces at the reception desk.  The friendliness and the helpfulness of the staff cannot be…
December 2014,Fantastic&romantic,"Very nice little butique hotel with helpful stuff. Room was very cosy, with fireplace and comfort bed. Location was the best. It was only couple hundred metres away from Buckingham Palace and short walk away from Victoria bus station. Hop on-hop off bus station was almost in front of the hotel. Loved to spend our christmas time there, hotel lobby was also very cosy and stuff spoiled us a lot. Definately will visit again."
January 2015,51st Wedding Anniversary,"This has to be the best hotel in London,we were celebrating our 51st anniversary and spent one night at Hotel 41.From the moment you enter the hotel and receive the unique registration format (crudités and champagne) to the exceptional room facilities, it's the first hotel We have visited that have sanitised TV controls in sealed plastic bags.We would also congratulate the highly professional and friendly staff. Do visit Hotel 41 it's amazing!"
January 2015,A hidden treasure,What a find!! We stayed for two nights and we had a great time. We were met by the doorman as we pulled up. Luggage taken into the hotel and the car was whisked away. We were greeted by name by the staff who were really attentive. If you're not used to it you could feel a little overwhelmed but with only 28 rooms the staff have plenty of time to look after you. We had a glass of champagne whilst we were checking in and complimentary snacks whilst we waited for our room. The executive lounge is very tastefully laid out and never too busy so it feels like you're in an exclusive club. Be aware that although the snacks and cold drinks are free the tea and coffee that they offer certainly aren't and are added onto the bill without a word....no slip to sign so we were surprised when…
January 2015,Discreet and exceptional service.,"We had 2 nights here for a birthday weekend of shopping and partying. The service for us is unrivalled and we are used to being spoiled having recently stayed in the Savoy and the Sanderson. Loved the executive lounge, really can't wait to return to spend a little more time making the most of it. Thankyou to all of the staff for a wonderful stay."
February 2014,Ultra High Quality,"Stayed here in February 2013 in a fantastic two-floor room. Entrance through a nice seating area with a fireplace, spacious bedroom in the top floor. Nice 1920's surroundings in the lounge, breakfast is generous and the afternoon canapés is a feature rarely seen in London establishments."
December 2014,A JEWEL OF THE CROWN,"A JEWEL OF THE CROWN  (IN THE MOST LITERAL SENSE OF THE EXPRESSION ! )  Following the online reservation of rooms on the website for 3 nights of the Hotel, communication with the staff prior to arrival was most informative and kind, helpful and attentive to all our requests. I had planned this journey for my partner’s birthday and I could already feel that the staff paid attention to every wish I would formulate. Moreover, they arranged for private transfer to pick us up from the airport upon arrival, as indeed I had requested.   As soon as we arrived at the hotel, Mr Malcolm Hendry, General Manager, came outside to greet us and even kindly helped us with our luggage himself (!!). Once we got into the ground-floor hall we knew we would absolutely love the place. Mr Hendry told…"
December 2014,5/5 isn't enough - 100/100,"We stayed early December 2014. Not only would I say this is the best hotel in London, I'd say it's the best hotel I've stayed in in the UK and Europe.  We stayed for our 10 year anniversary. We checked in and sat in the lounge while the excellent staff sorted our room.  We was shown to the room where all our belongings was waiting, with a happy anniversary card.  The hotel is totally stunning, and I see a lot of buildings as a surveyor. Everything is spotless. The food is second to none, and the restaurant next door, Bbar, - wow.  I cannot thank all the staff enough for making our stay a totally amazing experience.   My only regret is not being able to thank all the members of staff that we had the pleasure of meeting during our 4 day stay. We will definitely be returning to…"
December 2014,Nine days (and nights) in heaven,"After reading the rave reviews online, we decided to give this hotel a try.  It was even better than we had hoped for.  From the welcome with champagne to our final breakfast before our departure, we were treated like royalty.  (The hotel is literally just down the street from Buckingham Palace, and at times, we could swear that we must actually be guests of the Queen, staying within her private domain.)  The atmosphere is one similar to that of a fine gentlemen's club in the Saint James district.  The main room, called the Executive Lounge, is filled with beautiful mahogany furniture and features comfortable seating, a cozy fireplace, and a very attentive staff always available to help.  The service is outstanding but understated.  Help seems to appear magically just as it is…"
December 2014,Once again No 41 delivers,"We continue to run out of wonderful things to say about this hotel and its outstanding staff.  They have once again made my wife and i's annual London trip perfect.  From the free flowing champange when you arrive to the tea by the fireside before you leave everything was done with a friendly smile, a kind word and genuine customer care.  The attention to detail is exceptional, especially for returning guests (thank you for the strawberries) and sets the bar over and above 5* standard.  It is not a cheap option but its incredibly good value.  We'll be back."
December 2014,Fabulous special weekend,"This is the 3rd time we have stayed at 41 and we took some friends for a special birthday celebration. The welcome we received was lovely and we and more importantly our friends were really well looked after for the whole weekend. The rooms are beautiful, the lounge and well stocked plunder pantry are wonderful and the service brilliant! Can't wait until we can go again."
December 2014,Wonderful hotel,"Our 2 night stay last week was amazing and everything that has been said in previous reviews is well and truly the truth.The staff at 41 do go the extra mile for everyone and you are made to feel special.I have been raving about 41 since I returned to work.Unfortunately as it was a treat from work I don't think we would be able to afford to go again,but at least we had the chance to sample perfection.Thank you to all the staff for an incredible 2 days."
December 2014,"Authentic Luxury, Authentic Service","My wife and I came to experience relaxation and comfort. We found authentically attentive (at this level we all know the difference) staff, who were so very kind. They couldn't do enough for us. From the doorman to Lauren Hargrave, Resident Manager, every member of staff gave a luxurious service to go with the 5*+ hotel.  Hotel 41 really is the centre of authentic luxury in the centre of London.   There are so many extra treats, and I'd love to share them here, but you really want to experience the surprise of it all. Trust me it's wonderful.   Our room was fabulous and we would love to stay there every time we return, which we surely will whenever we are in London. (Move over Dorchester) Hotel 41 is our new home from home.   Thank you all at Hotel 41. See you soon."
December 2014,Exceeded my expectations,"First, this hotel is not for the bargain traveler. But, it it worth every cent. Good location in central London with short walk (5min)  to Victoria Station. But equally easy to walk to all the other locations in London. Small boutique hotel with very very personalized service. The entire staff should be commended for thier attentiveness and friendliness. I would stay at Hotel 41 again and again.  I was visitng London for business/leisure."
December 2014,Our new number one favourite London hotel,"Stayed one night in mid-December as part of my birthday celebrations. From the moment we arrived we were treated to a master-class in customer service. At the reception, in the Executive Lounge, we were offered a choice of complimentary (vintage and non-vintage) champagnes. Our suite, on two floors, was very special indeed. After our theatre trip, we indulged in some terrific fresh snack foods in the beautifully seasonally-decorated lounge. Once back in our room we were met with a very romantic trail of rose petals and a crackling fire.  We slept very soundly and (after the best power-shower ever) had a very tasty breakfast with porridge to die for. Even after we checked out, we were invited back after our trip for some more treats.  We'll definitely be back next time we're…"
December 2014,Exceptional service,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for our anniversary in December, from the moment that we arrived I knew that I had made the right decision in booking Hotel 41. We were greeted by the door staff who welcomed us by name, then took us through to the lounge for checking in, we were offered a glass of (good) champagne and the lovely Lauren chatted with us about our plans for the weekend, offering assistance with taxi's, directions and even offering to book a local hairdressers for me. The rooms were beautifully appointed, gorgeous furniture and fixings and one of the best beds Ive slept in. When we returned in the evening they had turned down our room with candles, music and rose petals, such a lovely touch. My favourite memory of the weekend will be returning to the lounge, sitting by the…"
December 2014,Many Happy Returns,"It's a little while since we stayed.  We are pleased to see the management team remains the same, which is unusual in London hotels, and we always receive a warm welcome back.  The consistency of the product and service is always first class.  The canapes and Plunder the Pantry offerings for the winter season are impressive, and they have even increased the choice of soap gifts at Reception.  The downstairs departure offering too, is lovely, with chocolate truffles to die for, other choices of sweets and savouries, and water and/or good coffee to take away for your journey.  Other hotels simply do not give these things away within the price. The hotel looks great for Christmas and we were pampered as always.  Our thanks to all the team, and see you in 2015!  C&L"
December 2014,By far the best hotel we have ever stayed at!,"A couple of years back while on vacation at Disneyland, my family won the grand prize giveaway  which was a night stay in Disneyland's Dream Suite(above the Pirates of the Caribbean ride and originally build as Walt Disney's private apartment)  plus VIP treatment during our stay.  It was a once in a life time experience!!  My husband and I just returned from our trip to London where we stayed at the Hotel 41 and I would describe it was the same sort of Hotel experience as Disneyland's Dream Suite.  From the moment we arrived we were pampered!  They have thought of every detail and it shows!  The location was great, walking distance to many must-see sights and right across the street from Buckingham Palace.  The breakfast was amazing, and the snack bar they set up at night was a…"
December 2014,Wonderful intimate atmosphere,"This hotel is a special place ,the staff are particularly attentive and personal without being intrusive highly recommended for guests who prefer the  small and intimate atmosphere which is created superbly by all the staff at the 41"
December 2014,The best hotel at which I've had the pleasure of staying,"Having only ever heard the reviews & stories of this hotel, and fortunately being a business traveller to London's 5 star accommodations, I was prepared for this to be another lovely boutique hotel. What I was not prepared for however, was the absolute joyous and uninhibited luxury of Hotel 41.  Even before we entered the secluded & regal lobby, the feel and impression of the building is clearly indicative of the luxury within. met by the most attentive & pleasant young lady, Roberta was welcoming, personable, and interested- immediately introduced us to the hotel. From the check in- at what can only be likened to a fine private club- through to our service at the lounge, the staff at Hotel 41 are by far the most courteous individuals I have had the pleasure of being around.  As…"
November 2014,Outstanding, my self and my husband stayed here to celebrate my 40th birthday. From the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out we were treated like royalty .5stars all the way I'd give more if I could loved every minute of it 😍 hope we have the pleasure of staying again.
October 2014,"Amazing, just amazing","Myself and my husband treated ourselves to a 2 night stay for our 10th wedding anniversary, and to say it was amazing would be an understatement. From the moment we arrived, the staff did everything they could to make our weekend as special as possible. The hotel itself is incredible, pure luxury, from having your bags taken at the lobby, to champagne to sip on at check in, fabulous food, and the lounge with its ""pantry"", a never-ending supply of tasty nibbles perfect after a day around London, or indeed, a night out around London."
December 2014,Fantastic stay at this fabulous hotel,"My wife and I just spent three nights at 41 and can't say enough good things about the hotel and the staff.  From the moment we arrived to the when we got in the taxi to leave, every interaction with the staff was incredibly positive, helpful, and courteous.  Their genuine desire to assist their guests is apparent - from making dinner reservations, booking tours, and helping with directions they are there to help.  The hotel itself was immaculate and every detail done to great luxury.  We will absolutely go back to 41 when we return to London and can't recommend this hotel, and it's fabulous staff, highly enough. Stay there - you will not be disappointed."
December 2014,Absolutely Outstanding,"My partner and I had the pleasure of staying at 41 for a two-night break from 5th-7th December.  From the moment we stepped away from the madness and noise of London into the beautiful black and white foyer, we were treated like royalty.  We were welcomed by Malcolm, the manager and his team; we were relieved of our luggage and taken up in the lift to the Executive Lounge to check in.  What a check-in!  A trolley bearing a selection of bottles of champagne was presented to us by Norbert and we were invited to choose.  Having completed all the formalities, it was suggested we sit in the lounge and finish our champers before going up to our room, Norbert kindly having served us delicious canapes and nibbles to soak up the bubbles.  I had booked us the 'Night To Remember' package…"
December 2014,"Special, secret place","Our second visit to 41 and just love this little gem. Really don't want to share it with anyone else however it's too good not to recommend. Our beautiful cosy room was perfect, apart from external building noise but after mentioning this to the lovely in house team we were soon moved - and what a move. They very kindly put us in the amazing Balmoral Suite which was so much more than we could have wished for. We spent our evening in the relaxing, stylish lounge having cocktails and ""plundering the pantry"".  Tasty delicacies, both savoury and sweet. Such a treat and we are already saving up for our next visit. "
November 2014,WOW!,"We stayed at Hotel 41 back in November for my boyfriends 21st birthday. After looking on trip advisor and noticing Hotel 41 was rated #1 and reading through the amazing reviews I thought it were only right I booked to stay there for the occasion.  Hotel 41 contacted me before our stay with a preference form to see if we had any special requirements for example what kind of pillows we liked, in house massages, if we would like a bike machine in our room etc. Hotel 41 were very happy to accept special requests, they also asked if the stay was for a special occasion.   When I first booked the hotel I did think to myself it was a little pricey, after visiting all I can say it was worth every penny, every single penny.  I did not want to leave, even though it was only 1 nights stay…"
November 2014,Great stay,"We just returned from 3 night stay at 41 hotel, the other reviews really cover it well. The staff were so helpful and accommodating.  We arrived early in the morning from an overnight flight from the states, and since our room wasn't ready, they offered us a courtesy room to use until our room was ready. The snacks available throughout the day were great and the room was spacious and very comfortable. On top of all that, location is perfect, near Victoria tube station and Gatwick Express train.  41 has spoiled us, we won't be able to stay anywhere else in London. "
December 2014,A haven of excellency,"A haven of peace, comfort, effortless quality & chic, nothing's too little, too small to make you feel at home, from the moment you arrive till the moment you leave.  And this in the heart of London. Could recommend the place to everybody !!! Filip"
November 2014,Hard to believe,"My wife stayed at 41 two years ago and came home raving about the place, so when we went back to London last week we stayed there again.  It was my first time and I must say that it was the most pleasant hotel stay that I have ever had.  The staff are unbelievably focused on making everything you might desire come to be. Polite, helpful, attentive are simple words but its all real at 41. The Executive Lounge is another delight.  I can't imagine returning to London unless we stay at Hotel 41."
July 2014,This is Royal Treatment,"From Check-in to Check-out, the quality of pampering here is unsurpassed, anywhere. The staff took care of every detail, right down t o remembering our first names. The rooms were decorated with the latest fashions, with heated floors and towel racks to boot! Being situated within walking distance of all the attractions, this is the place to stay. The price is of a 5 diamond hotel, but well worth the stay. Thank you Hotel 41......"
November 2014,Magnificent,"I want to echo previous comments. This place cannot be faulted. Treated perfectly from the moment you book. Nothing has been overlooked, they must have taken experience from many other places and just tweeked them to make them even better. A million small things that make the whole stay perfect. We will return."
November 2014,We just keep coming back!,"Usually I see a review like this and think, oh dear, they have too much time on their hands!! but I just wanted to do this wonderful hotel justice.  This was our 3rd year in a row at Hotel 41 and this year we were lucky enough to stay in a suite which was just beautiful. Incredibly luxurious but still very cosy and homely at the same time.   From the moment you step through the doors at this hotel you are made to feel like royalty.  We were welcomed back to the hotel like old friends and as we sat down by the fire with a glass of champagne it felt like we had never been away.    This time we had the afternoon tea accompanied by champagne which was lovely and when we returned to our room on the Friday night, we had the turn down service which was so romantic.  These are extras…"
November 2014,You will not want to leave!!!,"I knew I had chosen the right hotel even before we arrived when we received a detailed sheet asking us for our preferences for the room - types and number of pillows - humidifiers - yoga mats and DVD! Romantic Turndown, Express Check-In or Out, car transfers or theatre and restaurant bookings and even in-room spa treatments.  Everything about this hotel is geared to ensure that the guest has a wonderful stay - the location is perfect for access to all parts of London yet peaceful at the same time and close to green spaces.  The accommodation is relaxing and very comfortable - bedroom windows that open to provide fresh air - solid doors that close to ensure no noise during the night - proper hair dryers in the room - with long cables so no struggling to reach a mirror - lots of…"
November 2014,5 and a half star !,Spent three nights here recently. This is a classic boutique hotel - with exceptional staff.  From the moment you walk into the tiny but lovely (Harry Potter) reception - it is as if you are not in London. The hotel is very quiet despite being in a bustling area and next to a building site.  It is old English style - maybe not to everyone's taste - but certainly to ours. The food is very good - but it is the attention to detail and the exceptional staff that makes this a wondrous place. Very close to Victoria Station - so convenient to get everywhere.  Special mention to Magdelana for historic service.   Cannot wait to return.
October 2014,Absolutley superb hotel!,"This is one the best hotels I have been too! I love the design,  the layout and everything! Really great service and wish I could stay there longer! I would definitely visit again if I come back again on a visit!"
November 2014,Excellent!,"Our fifth visit this November and wonderful in every way. Location good, attention to detail eg without me asking they put a hot water bottle in bed. The staff are superb make it the best we have stayed in London, with their professional but friendly service. We're already booked for the next visit."
November 2014,The best so far,"Simply amazing, a real gem, from the minute you arrive you know its going to be special, we were greeted like old friends & offered a glass of champagne whilst we checked in, nothing was to much trouble, the staff were superb, really was a fantastic experience. Would we stay again? You bet."
November 2014,Don't stay anywhere else!,Just returned from a simply marvellous 2 night stay. The previous reviews have said it all. The team are very professional in all that they do and attention to detail is second to none. I highly recommend this hotel as a place to stay in London don't stay anywhere else. We will most definitely be returning for a longer stay next time.
November 2014,"Superb Hotel, highly recommend","We wanted somewhere nice to stay and this hotel fitted our expectations. It's not often I give 5 marks, but this hotel was worth it. The service and the attention to detail set this hotel apart from others. We only stayed 1 night, but could of stayed more. The little extra details and the welcome was great. The only slight criticism was we stayed in 4108, and the creaking footsteps was quite noisy. But apart from that wonderfully loomed after and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again."
October 2014,Another Perfect Stay At London's Hidden Gem,"There is very little I can say that I haven't already said about this wonderful property. The staff perfectly exemplify never-say-no hospitality, with each and every member of staff taking the time to better know and understand their guests. The dining was excellent as always, as were the provisions on the pantry.  Overall another lovely stay at 41 and I will no doubt return."
October 2014,Excellent,Stayed for our anniversary. The staff couldn't be more helpful and welcoming. Our room was small but comfortable and had everything you could possibly need. Only had breakfast but couldn't fault it. Will definitely stay again and would recommend to anyone.
October 2014,EXCELLENT jewel in London!,"Hotel 41 is a lovely jewel in London.  Fantastic location near Buckingham Palace!  Amazing service, food, rooms...PURE GRACIOUS HOSPITALITY!!!!  It feels like home!  From the champagne welcome throughout each day's amenities, Hotel 41 has it all.  A quiet, lovely respite in the midst of busy London!"
October 2014,Overdue review!,"I've stayed here with my wife at least 20 times in the last few years, and will always look to 41 first when booking a place for myself or friends.  While the amazing rooms and common spaces come as standard and outshine the other top hotels in London, it is the personal service and welcoming team looking after us during our stays that always stand out.    They remember us by name, face, and even voice on the phone after years between bookings!  They know what we like and don't like, and prepare our room accordingly in advance whenever we are staying there.  For example, at my wife's suggestion, they provide a free standing full length mirror which is already in situ when we get to our room (the ladies will appreciate this, I am led to believe).    Simply a super hotel with all…"
October 2014,Posh and service-oriented hotel very close to Buckingham Palace.,"The staff are excellent at the hotel- everyone gets to know you and tries to assist you in any way they can. The rooms are comfortable and well-appointed. Soft towels and comfortable sheet/bedding.  There is a lounge area which is stocked with drinks and snacks 24 hours a day and that offers meals and cocktails as well as tea. The room we booked had air conditioning problems the first night of our stay and the staff moved us to a new room that was larger and even more beautiful. They gave us complimentary champagne and waived our first night's charge because of the AC problem. While we were at dinner, the staff lit candles and placed rose petals throughout our room . They went well above and beyond our expectations. We will definitely return!"
October 2014,Wonderful,"I stayed at this lovely hotel last week and it was a truly superb and decadent experience.  As soon as you walk in the door you feel taken care of.  The executive lounge and the rooms themselves are luxurious and you feel totally pampered.  From check in with champagne, to the plunder the pantry, there was nothing that was missed.  The staff is wonderful and they pay close attention to detail.  My room was lovely with a view of the Royal Mews.  Located about a 5 minute walk from Victoria Station, I was able to navigate the tube to all the wonderful landmarks.  I will definitely be visiting again and I can see why they earned this rating on trip advisor.  Truly a classic elegant hotel.  Can't wait to visit again."
August 2014,Very very excellent.,IT ios in the prime place for a hotel and the rooms are spotless. The staff treat you well and it deserves all the acclodaes that it has received. All the services are propt and friendly. Not a big hotel but the roomsc are a fair size. Hotels in London are expensive.
September 2014,Fantastic Hotel!!,"Two weeks ago my husband, my son and me, we were at the Hotel 41, and everything was perfect, in the 3 days we stayed there.. The big smile in our arrival, the welcome cocktail, our amazing suite!! The cozy lobby and the great service in all our request, every one was promptly resolved and always with an incredible attention and great smile.  Usually we are going to London 3 times a year, And this was our first visit to the Hotel 41, was great we did it!..  For sure in our next visit to London,  we will back to this beautiful and charming Hotel !!  Thank you Piero, Remus, Simone, Paula, Yohann, Mitchel and Stefanie, every one of you made to us feeling like at home with all your attentions and great service!!  Marcela F."
October 2014,A gem in the heart of London,What a remarkable hotel.  From the minute we arrived it felt like home.  On arrival we were greeted at the door with a glass of sherry and from that moment on we were totally pampered.  I was a bit nervous about booking a hotel in that price bracket but I was not disappointed and will certainly be staying here next time I visit London.  The beautiful lounge was like being at home curled up with a magazine.  Totally worth the money.
October 2014,A one night stop over for a special event,"I booked 41 after googling ""best hotel in London"" as I had a special occasion in London. The booking process was excellent and the lady on the telephone was very attentive.the location is a 4 minute walk from Victoria station. On arrival the whole experience started to snowball into sensory overload. The staff are fabulous, the facilities excellent and the bedroom... Well, I booked the basic room, I dread to think what the suites will be like. Our room had a mezzanine floor and a swimming pool for a bath, with 3 TVs in the room. The hotel is small , and if there is a con to the pros it will be the cost. However, even though it is not cheap, it is value for money, and that for a 5* is not an easy thing to address. If you can afford to stay at 41 it is a must stay hotel in London.…"
September 2014,perfect,We stayed at this hotel as a treat when we came to London for the great British Pub awards. The Staff and management were faultless as was the food. we would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. The late night buffet is inspired and very welcome after a long night out
June 2014,Birthday delight,"My husband and I stayed for his birthday and it was fantastic. The staff were excellent, the rooms divine, the food at the attached restuarant was bliss, we even bought an umbrella it was that good!!! Highly recommended for a romantic get away, being in the city its the one place that is quiet in London and we loved it."
September 2014,Indulgence at its finest,Hotel 41 is a pricey hotel so staying here really was a treat for my boyfriend and me. Having said that it was worth EVERY penny. Talk about being pampered. My boyfriend described Hotel 41 as a hotel from a movie due to the level of customer service all staff members exhibited at all times. The all-day rotating snack bar is a nice touch and the lounge has a very comfortable atmosphere. It is true that the rooms (or at least the one I stayed in) are a little on the small side but the experience of staying here overcomes any small inconvenience this may cause. Would definitely stay here again the next time we’re in London.
September 2014,Number one Hotel in London on tripadvisor ?,"Normally when in London I stay at the Savoy or Claridges but I also rate highly No1.Aldwych, The Grosvenor, The Four Seasons at Canary Wharf and the May Fair.I have always been curious however as to how 41 gets to rank as the best hotel in London on tripadvisor .I therefore decided last week to stay there .I was not disappointed.The Hotel is exceptionally good, the reviews are accurate and it deserves its ranking.The staff are indeed as good as any I have come across worldwide not so much for their supreme competence but more for the relaxed way they undertake their duties in a way that leaves you with the distinct impression that enjoy what they do and take enormous pride in maximising your enjoyment.Red Carnation Group Hotels continue to impress."
September 2014,Superb!!!!,"Before I even try to describe how ""Superb"" the 41 is I want to say that my wife and I have never had a more enjoyable stay at a hotel than we had at Hotel 41!  That says a lot as we have traveled much over our life together.  Have you ever teared up when you had to depart from a hotel?  My wife could not hold back the tears when we said goodbye to the best hotel staff we have ever had the opportunity to be so close to.  Lauren, Marlen, Monica, Piero, Johann and all the other staff became our family away from home.  They don't allow any small detail to be missed and do it with a warm smile and a caring attitude.  Here is a great example.  We went out to the show ""Wicked"" at the Apollo Theatre close by to the hotel.  When we returned home from the show and entered our room there…"
September 2014,One Word,"If I was allowed to write one word, it would be ""Amazing"".  From the minute that you arrive in this hotel, you will feel, completely enveloped in the quality and service.  The staff are polite without being over deferential.  Enjoy....I did!"
September 2014,A wonderful experience.,"We chose Hotel 41 because of its Trip Advisor ranking and reviews and we were certainly not disappointed. This is the perfect hotel for those who desire perfection and warmth in service and accommodations. It's location around the corner from Victoria Station and across from Buckingham Palace is great as we we enjoyed walks through Green Park everyday there. The staff is the friendliest, most conscientious and helpful of any I have experienced sans the arrogance that is often displayed. Our two story suite a bit ""tight"", but perfectly quiet and tastefully done as is the entire hotel.  It may not be the place for the bar crowd, gym rats or those looking for the scene, but if you want comfort, impeccable service, location and quiet, this is an experience you might also find…"
June 2014,Wow wee,"did the queen stay here once? Cause it's so fancy I loved it I suggest going here treat your self once in a life time opportunity spend the big money and Stay here's it's amazing and a tv in the bathroom wow love it, cleaners were amazing cleaned so well and dressed nicely too all the staff a big thank you for making my family feel at home"
September 2014,Best hotel staff I've ever encountered.,"I wasn't crazy about the rooms (personal style) but the staff is absolutely outstanding and you get much more than what you pay for. They have free stuff everywhere in the room and are incredibly accommodating. Even though it's got a classic boutique hotel feel, it is incredibly modern. And best part besides the staff is the free wifi !"
August 2014,Absolutely fantastic!,My first impression the beauty of hotel. the hotel was charming as a perfection and can be complained. staff is very excellent and attentive. Absolutely fantastic!. this was the best hotel in London in my opinion
August 2014,insert superlative here..,"I have stayed in a lot of places and travelled all around the world but there is no doubt in my mind that this is the best hotel experience I have ever had. From the moment I walked in I felt at home, comfortable, cared about.  Hotels often give good service and staff often look like they care about the service they give but in this Hotel they dont have staff, they have hosts.  Hosts do more than staff and care more about how you feel. To be a good host is not a job it is a lifestyle and a vocation, not everyone can do it, not everyone wants to do it but here the people of Hotel 41 do and they do so exceptionally. From the moment we were greeted at the doorway to the moment we popped back in to collect our bags at the end of the visit after a hectic visit of the capital.  I…"
September 2014,Simply the best! Thank you Hotel 41.,"What a fabulous hotel! We stayed here for two nights to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special, being a small hotel the staff know all the guests names and show a genuine interest in your daily plans. We can't single out anyone as they were all excellent!  Our room was beautifully decorated in the hotel's black and white theme, we had an accessible bathroom with bath and separate walk in shower. Lots of fluffy towels and lovely Penhaligan toiletries added to the luxury. There was a lovely cake on a table with 'Happy Anniversary' piped on the plate and the staff also sent us a card.  It's the little touches that make Hotel 41 stand out - we mentioned that we were going to see Billy Elliot and later that day found a signed…"
August 2014,Wow!,"Having stayed here to enjoy a mutual birthday celebration, I am convinced that no other hotel could possibly compare to this amazing find. In all honesty I am very wary of my next stay that is anywhere else but here as there is little hope of this experience being surpassed ever. From the moment the little champagne trolley was wheeled out as part of the very wecloming check in to the thoughtful touches throughout the stay, the service here is truly second to none and the facilities are beyond wow! There is luxury hotels and then there is this property!"
July 2014,Exceptional hotel and staff!,"From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you have a wonderful,experience. Service and staff amazing. Very good location close to dining and shopping. Concierge was one of the best ever and gave great tips on what to do and see."
August 2014,"""Secret hotel"" that you don't want to share with anyone else","What an amazing place! We stayed here for only 3 days but will definitely return in the future. Not a typical 5 star hotel, this place is a definition of a boutique hotel with lots of character and signature English decor. Those people who are looking for a modern hotel with all of the new tech updates should probably stay elsewhere. With only 28 (?) rooms, staff knows theirs guests by name, communicating with concierge is easy and service is great. Having a 24/7 pantry room, free of charge (except for alcohol) was definitely a plus.The room did not have a nice view and typically I would complain about that, but the accommodations made me totally forget about that. The decor, our own living room and an amazing lobby/club room made up for that.   One suggestion for the hotel is…"
April 2014,Yes!,"Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was.  Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful.  Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price.  Will certainly return in near future! "
August 2014,Made very welcome,"The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed."
August 2014,Very special,"This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful.  Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat."
August 2014,Superb birthday stay,"Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here.  The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate.  Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel.  The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London."
August 2014,"""The"" Hotel in London","This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne).  We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef.   Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic.  I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you…"
August 2014,Our 25th Wedding Anniversary,"Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne.  Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room.  Inside a congratulations cake & sweets.  We had canapés & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music.  I was very emotional.  Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41.  Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere.  We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave.  Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again.  Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well.  Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful."
August 2014,A 2nd visit within last 3 months,"We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August.  We love this hotel.  The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren.  All of the staff was so friendly and helpful.  All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations.  We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good!  Great canapés at cocktail time in the lounge.  The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city.  Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41."
August 2014,Outstanding boutique hotel,"This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one.…"
August 2014,5 Star Service!,"We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations.   There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing!  If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place…"
August 2014,Wonderful oasis!!,"My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit."
August 2014,One of the best in London,"I am not easily impressed, however; on this occasion I was. Would like to say that it is an absolutely amazing cave to escape and relax and to enjoy pure luxury.  The best thing about this establishment is their personnel. True professionals in every sense. Fabulous!! Nothing is too much trouble and with a huge smile on their faces.  Most amazing bed in my suite. Like a huge fluffy cloud. Slept like a baby!  Attention to detail is added to absolutely everything.  Truly impressed and will be returning soon.  Great location for exploring if you are visiting London for pleasure rather than business."
August 2014,Fantastic service,From the moment we arrived the service was impeccably efficient and friendly too. The check in was seamless and the choice of arrival drink a lovely touch. The room was very well appointed and decorated with lots of toiletries and towels. There service was very personal and the staff all remembered our names and asked about our theatre trip on our return to the hotel. We loved the plunder the pantry in the evening with the selection of tasty treats. This was in the executive lounge which was a great place to relax any time of day. The breakfast had a great selection of quality items including excellent cooked choices. We have visited four different Red Carnation Hotels. They are all very good. This is the best. 
August 2014,The Perfect Proposal,"What an amazing experience! For months I have looked at different ways to propose in or around London but failed to find something special. I am glad I chose Hotel 41!  Weeks in advance I was given the opportunity to discuss every single detail with the Hotel team. It was planned so perfectly that when I checked-in I thought they had forgotten about what was supposed to happen.  A Proposal in the rooftop of the hotel with a champagne tasting experience and canapes. The actual proposal was made using telescope pointing at an adjacent building with a message: ""Will you marry me?"". Over the course of the evening we had the opportunity to then see the stars and the moon - Pretty romantic and unique! The following day we went for a picnic in St. Jame's Park, which is just a few…"
August 2014,Lovely small boutique hotel with the perfect location.,"This 28 room hotel does feel like a private club instead of a hotel. If you like very small hotels  then this is the place for you. As you walk into the front door off the street, you are directed up to an elevator to the executive lounge which is the check out/in area/ breakfast area, etc. A beautiful room for sure. We stayed for one night only as a layover and were in the Monarch Suite, a small 2 room area, and my husband and I both had separate bathrooms and a door bt/ the bedroom and living room. It was perfect for us, I cannot image anymore than 2 people staying in any of their rooms or suites. The location is great. Overall we really liked this hotel, not loved it. My husband summed it up perfectly, and but would go back again, but it was a little claustrophobic for him. …"
August 2014,One of the Best in the World,"There are only two places in the world we have stayed that came close to the service we experienced at Hotel 41. Lauren, Victoria and Steffan (amongst several others I cannot recall) were simply amazing and went WAY above and beyond what we hoped for. Their constant refreshing of snacks and food in the main area (not sure if that is what they call it) was also awesome, they took really, really good care of us and I also appreciate a place that uses brilliant branding. You will find the 41 logo on almost everything in your room which, as a marketer, I thought was cool. We highly recommend this place and it is easy walking distance to Buckingham palace."
March 2014,Hotel 41!!,"Hotel 41! What a great hotel in such a perfect location, right in the heart of the city. Its very close to all the major shopping, nightlife and attractions. Very stylish and comfortable space, surprisingly large for downtown london. Superb service and excellent environment. Highly recommended"
August 2013,Very Very Good Service,"My husband fell in love with this hotel. The location is wonderful. The staff are amazing, they even gave me a hot water bottle in the bed to warm it up! They changed rooms to one with a fireplace! Amazing. However, the staff was so attentive, I almost felt uncomfortable."
July 2014,Beat in the whole wide world!!,Hands down this is my favorite hotel in the world. It was the first time I stayed there and it was the last time. The hotel itself is quirky and cool while the staff is nothing short of awesome. My daughter and I were treated like royalty. I think the employees truly enjoy working here because they are so happy and helpful- no task too big for them. It's so very close to Buckingham Palace I thought of waving to the Queen!
July 2014,Superb,"Our second stay at Hotel 41 and pleased to say the standards are as high as ever. The staff make this hotel what it is and their professionalism and friendliness is amazing. One of our party was in a wheelchair and he was well catered for and looked after. Special thanks to stefan and lauren who were attentive, helpful and amusing. Keep up the great work- can't wait to stay again"
July 2014,Just a bowl of cherries,"Many five star hotels have sumptious surroundings, delicious food and drink and exceptional comfort,  Hotel 41 has all of these but also something else that sets it apart - absolutely amazing customer service which is friendly and professional but never snooty.   I stayed here for three nights with my 11 year old daughter in a Junior Suite as a treat for her winning a major golf competition.  We returned to our room on the first evening to find a 'congratulations' cake waiting for her, its fair to say she was delighted at this thoughtful touch.  One afternoon we returned to the hotel and my daughter proceeded to avail herself of the cherries dotted around the complimentary fruit bowl in the street level lobby. The concierge inquired if we would be going to the executive lounge…"
June 2014,"Location and service: ""Brilliant""","There is really not much that I can add to the other rave reviews.  Location: unbeatable – right next to the Queen.   Staff: very professional and personable – with a special mention to Monika and Stefan, who both went the extra mile to make our stay special.   Rooms: not particularly large, but well appointed, comfortable and cozy.  Breakfast: generous – particularly enjoyed the eggs royal!   We went out each evening and sadly never managed to “raid the pantry.”  Which leads to my only quibble: the entrance is locked and left unattended at 11:00PM – perhaps a tad early (especially when the key card doesn’t work), but no big deal.  All in all, an exceptional hotel.  A bit pricey, but one gets what one pays for.  Will definitely return."
July 2014,Loved it!,"We celebrated my wife's birthday here - and I am so pleased with the choice.  A special hotel - boutique style. The rooms are very pleasant, not huge, but knockout when you're trying to impress the missus!  The service was attentive but not overbearing, friendly but respectful - really pleasant. Nothing was too much trouble.  The Executive lounge is done out like a gentlemen's club (well, not having been to one, how I imagine such a club to be). Snacks all day (no charges) and an honesty bar.  The welcome glass of champagne on arrival really got the day off to a super start. And, if it's a romantic weekend, the turndown service was perfect.   During the week there are also business guests apparently, so it is not just couples.  We will be back! Loved it."
May 2014,WOW,I had booked the Rubens for a 50th Birthday treat for my husband. On arrival we were greeted by the duty manager who upgraded us to Hotel 41. What a fantastic surprise. When entering this hotel you are made to feel so very special. Our room was perfect and a welcome Happy Birthday cake from the hotel. We also had afternoon tea which was just perfect. This hotel certainly has the Wow factor and we can honestly say we have never experienced such a high standard of service from any other hotel where  we have stayed in. The staff deserve a massive congratulation's for there excellent customer relations skills. I only hope One day I have the pleasure of returning.
July 2014,Amazing Experience,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel 41 in London England last weekend and were blown away by the service provided by this boutique hotel located close to Buckingham Palace in London.The staff went above and beyond the call of duty and the accommodations were outstanding. We would recommend this gem to anyone looking for a charming getaway in the heart of London. Steve and Ewa from Oakville, Canada"
July 2014,Second visit even better than the first,"My first visit blew me away and this second visit in a year improved on that. The staff manage to combine super-friendliness with great professionalism and customer service. They remembered us AND our TripAdvisor review!  Any room is great and make sure you leave room in your diet for the deli counter in the evening after the theatre - it includes salmon, desserts such as profiteroles, cheeses, cold meats, a mini hot dish etc.  I will always choose this hotel from now on!"
August 2014,Amazing,"Everything about this hotel is fantastic. The deserts at night are delicious the ice cream fridge is great, definitely take advantage of their pantry.  The staff is so fabulous, always there but not intrusive and they don't stand around awkwardly waiting for a tip (I hate that). The bed is so soft and comfy, the shower and tubs are also fabulous, best shower head ever. Champagne on arrival with fresh berries waiting in our room and a pillow menu I case you need so something different."
August 2014,"Wonderful stay, lovely staff and very convenient location","We stayed at the Hotel 41 in the Balmoral suite for four nights in August 2014 with our three children and we cannot say enough kind words about the staff who were so gracious and accommodating to us - and especially to our children who are 8, 11 and 13. We travel quite a bit with our children and Hotel 41 was one of our favorites of all time. From giving us bus map apps, to helping us with tour tickets, to ""fixing"" our tv (our own tech deficiencies), to the fresh fruit in the room and delicious snacks in the Executive Suite - the staff was incredible.   We came to the 41 after spending a week in Ireland where we had quite large separate rooms or suites, so all of us were worried that we'd be on top of each other in one suite -- but that was NOT the case at 41! We were so happy…"
August 2014,Another world...,"I booked this hotel at the last minute as I wanted to be close to my first meeting.  After flying in on a late flight from NY I arrived around 11 pm but was greeted by a friendly staff, glass of champagne and buffet of appetizers in the lounge.  The lounge itself is very formal, old world and an experience by itself.  The room was not big but was well appointed and had everything I needed.  I liked the idea of the ""plunder the pantry"" concept but did not stay long enough to take advantage of it.  I was not crazy about the gym access at LA Fitness as the gym was not ideal but clearly better than nothing.  I also did not like all the construction going on close to the hotel but nothing they can do about this.  Overall I was impressed and will consider returning the next time I am…"
July 2014,Best Trip Ever,"We stayed at Hotel 41 in July 2014, after nearly 15 years from our last trip to London. It was amazing. From the effortless check-in, to having them print off my very own Washington Post, to relaxing breakfasts and pantry, our stay was perfect. Great location, top-notch and attentive staff, they made our week memorable. We will definitely stay here again!"
April 2014,No Regrets,"My wife and I stayed here, April of 2014....from the moment you arrive, you can tell this place is different and amazing. The check in was flawless, the rooms beautifully appointed, the parlor filled with complimentary wine/cheese/water/soda/ the reading area was amazing. The staff was very attentive and  always approachable. And the location, not sure if it could be more perfectly placed......Hotel 41 has our highest recommendation. "
April 2014,absolutely delightful experience and service!,"absolutely delightful experience and service! perfect location, service, and staff! I would love to come back to this small, cozy hotel!!  The hotel was very close to buckingham palace which is perfect for sightseers and travellers!"
August 2014,3 days in London - this is the place!,"My husband and I had the chance for a short trip to London without our kids. We had not been to London in nearly 20 years. We wanted to make the most of our three days and nights and the Hotel 41 was the perfect place to do so. The location near Buckingham palace was excellent. It was easy to walk to places such as Westminster Abbey and the London Eye from there, and there was a tube station close by. We also took a few taxis, which the hotel staff hailed for us. The Victoria Palace theater is just around the corner, where we saw the show Billy Elliott. Every morning we had a fantastic English breakfast, and we also had high tea as part of our package, which we thoroughly enjoyed. (It was a much more relaxed and gracious experience than the time we had tea at the Savoy back in…"
August 2014,Outstanding service & More...,"Well… Whoever will read this review is lucky. Why lucky? because after you finish, you will definitely reserve this fabulous hotel.  This Boutique hotel  is definitely the best in London. I have stayed in more than 20 different hotels in London and can't compare hotel 41 to others.  Location: Absolutely best possible in London.  Quite area and yet close to most London sites. (Big Ben, London Eye, all the Parks, Piccadilly, Museum and of course Buckingham palace)  Room: Wonderful. Well equipped, clean and shine. The best room in London for 400-450 pounds rate.  Service: OK… This is the best point here… I was always dreamed to get in London Hotels the service I'm getting in Thailand. I always thought it's impossible… Well… I was wrong! The service in Hotel 41 is the best in any…"
August 2014,Beyond the excellent,"Everything is perfect - location, service, staff, food, etc. etc. We just spent four nights at this hotel and definitely would love to come back.  You are treated almost like a member of a royal family at this small hotel. It's very cozy, clean, comfortable and very quiet. Not crowded - just 28 rooms, or so. Short walking distance to all major attractions (not to mention the Royal Mews and Buckingham Palace literally across the street). When I saw it, being listed as #1 at TripAdvisor, I expected it to be good, but it was really exceptional!!"
July 2014,Boutique hotel in a great location,"I jumped a flight from Washington DC to London one evening, leaving behind my husband to tend to the teenagers and decided a two night stay prior to a stay in the English countryside with girlfriends was just what the doctor had ordered. Hotel 41 did not disappoint!  It is a small hotel, tucked away and mere steps from Buckingham Palace, The Royal Mews and Victoria Station. Customer service is paramount and the staff were very attentive to my needs, knowing that I was a female traveling alone - an English Rose escaping her American philandering husband. This is a boutique hotel with high accolades from both TripAdvisor and Conde Nast. Yes, the rooms are small, but every detail and amenity are at your fingertips. And if you are looking for peace and quiet, then the hotel will not…"
July 2014,Nice Hotel,"Such a nice place with nice staff too. Easy to find, great location and would recommend the hotel to anyone. The people who stayed here were friendly too which made it an overall excellent experience."
January 2014,Wonderful hotel,"Hotel 41 was a really amazing experience, and the staff were doing everything possible to make our stay comfortable.  Eg. upon arrival, during check in, we were offered a glass of champagne in front of the fireplace and in the late afternoon, canapés were offered to guests sitting in the central lounge.  The hotel is quite small and very cozy, and the lounge is very relaxing and invites you to sit and chat, read a book etc. while you can help yourself to drinks and small snacks from the bar."
July 2014,Without question the best!!,"I cannot state enough how good this hotel is. The decor is beautiful, the food is amazing but what makes it above any other place I've ever stayed (or probably ever will) at is the staff. They go over and beyond what is the expected level of service and make your stay so good you just don't want to leave. My wife and I spent our last night of our honeymoon here before flying out and we didn't want to venture out of the hotel. I booked the romantic package which is definitely worth it, especially for the perfect night with your partner. At many hotels there are offers of extra this or that and they are overpriced and not worth it. Not here. Virtually any extra we went for was not only fantastic but perfecto worth the money. We cannot thank all the staff enough for the most…"
May 2014,Simply amazing!,"We stayed here for two nights, for our wedding anniversary, and everything was absolutely perfect.    From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty; upon our arrival we were booked into our room with a glass of champagne. The staff were brilliant. Breakfast was wonderful. After arriving back from the theatre, we were greeted with candles and rose petals scattered around our room, music playing and a bottle of champagne.  We have already recommended this hotel to friends of ours. There was nothing about our stay I would change - a truly memorable experience.   Many thanks to all at Hotel 41"
August 2013,By Far Best Hotel we have ever experienced,"Hotel 41 exceeded our expectations from the moment the door opened to the Lobby. They knew who we were before we introduced ourselves. We traveled with our children ages 8,12,and 16 as well as my parents aged 65. The employees went above and beyond to make sure everyones experience there was unforgetable. All the small details were attended to. Unfortunately a main water line was broken down the street while we were there causing the water to be shut down and the hotel staff provided extra bottles of water and whatever else they could to make it bearable in the meantime. And I can honestly say even with that glich (which was beyond their control) we had the most amazing time. Also the location is absolutely fabulous. Walking distance to all the main attractions one would want to…"
July 2014,"First impressions, they still work...","From the moment I was greeted at the lobby with the offer to valet park my car to the moment I departed the hotel, everything and everyone at 41 was a credit to RC Hotels. Quirky, yes, the most luxurious, possibly not, but in terms of the welcome, staffing, comfort, and being made to feel like a privileged individual and not just a number, 41 didn't miss a beat.   Arriving at 8.30am, a complimentary breakfast and a room to change in was offered by Monika and Lauren at reception which got us off to a fabulous start. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff and each of them were extremely polite, very well trained, and were faultless in making our stay as comfortable as possible at all times. The rooms were very comfortable and well sized, whilst the Executive…"
July 2014,the swank without the snoot,"we are the goofy americans people talk about, and still the staff was so uniformly cheerful, polite and friendly that we felt accepted and welcomed. they were more than eager to assist even when i got food poisoning and was a mess. i dealt with probably 10 different employees, and they were all gracious. i will definitely be back :)"
July 2014,awesome sevices,"What a great hotel in such a perfect location, in the heart of the city very close to all the major shopping, nightlife and attractions. Hotel 41 is a hotel within a hotel, its the top floor of another hotel and a very stylish and comfortable space. Surprisingly large for downtoen london and a very solid staff. Loved the hotel and the area"
July 2014,Hotel 41 is way past fantastic!,"Hotel 41 is a super fantastic hotel with super excellent service!  And that's putting it lightly!  My husband is a die hard Ritz Carlton fan.  I was surprised when he suggested we stay at a Red Carnation Hotel, but, well, who am I to complain?  Hotel 41 exceeded our expectations and for some reason I felt privileged to stay there.  It's that good.  It's way past excellent!    We were able to compare room decor and size with a similar room at the Grosvenor Hotel where one of our friends was staying.  Our bed was the size of his entire room, no need to discuss the differences any further.    As for service, the attendants are way past exceptional.  For example, we traveled to London to see the Monty Python Stage Show.  Monica found all the reviews and printed them out for us as…"
July 2014,Everyone knows your name but little details need attention,It has been a number of years since my last visit. While the lobby lounge keeps getting better there were a couple of complaints from my recent stay.  Rooms-while well appointed the bathrooms were very small and the showers especially small for a large guest. I stayed in three different rooms and found that when a separate shower area was provided the space was tiny. The Hospitality Suite at 839 pounds was much too expensive while the other rooms at 395 were fairly priced. On two occasions I asked about renting a local cell phone. No one gave me an answer. There is a large staff but I never figured out the distribution of responsibility. Upon checkout they resolved  my misunderstanding about champagne in the lounge being free rather than 16 or 17 pounds per glass. They were…
May 2014,Wow as Usual - A London Secret,"I stay at this hotel several times a year when I travel to London for business. The location is very central with easy to access the Underground. The secret of this hotel is the service, I have no idea what the staff to guest ratio is, but there is always someone to help you available at any time of the day. I regularly have business meetings in their boardroom, and they have assisted me getting tickets to plays and London events while I am in town with excellent attention to detail. I like to think of Hotel 41 as my home in London."
May 2014,A wonderful stay in a beautiful hotel,"This was the best and most relaxing stay in London we have ever had, largely due to the nature of the hotel and the staff and management who work there.  The service started before our visit with the manager asking for our personal preferences so that they could be accommodated for our arrival.  We received a complimentary room upgrade overlooking the Royal Mews, with complimentary champagne and personal message from the manager marking our special occasion.  Hotel 41 is a small but beautifully appointed hotel with top quality furnishings and room accessories. Although rooms are not huge the focus is very much on quality and service, rather than size. The theme of quality runs throughout the hotel.  The staff were exemplary and very attentive; some may have seen this as…"
October 2013,Another excellent stay,"Stayed in this hotel with the family, and it really was an excellent stay. The location is excellent, the staff are great, and I liked the decor. They also do a lot of small things that do make you stay that little bit more special."
March 2014,Luxury and Attention,"I have been fortunate enough to have stayed at Hotel 41 a number of times and the service, ambiance and every bit about this Hotel stays constant. It is superb, from the moment you arrive at the reception desk through to the very personal service received from every member of staff throughout your stay. All the staff want you to have a great experience, you can just tell and you do. I love to book in around lunchtime and just sit in the wonderful library surrounding until early evening, nibbling and drinking their brilliant wine, I just don't want to go anywhere, sad but true. I cannot recommend this Hotel more highly, it is just luxury. Additionally you are a few hundred yards walk from Buckingham Palace and the beautiful St. James Park as well as 20 minutes walk to Park Lane…"
May 2014,Never fails to be the best!,"This was our 4th time staying at 41 and at the risk of sounding like a broken record, it was excellent again! Monika and the team looked after us like old friends.  41 is relaxing, peaceful, friendly and quite simply the best place we've found to stay in London.  Hoping to be back again for Christmas!"
May 2014,"The ""E"" in Excellent","My wife and I recently stayed in Hotel 41. The experience was overwhelming.  The staff was professional, attentive, and exacting. Most times when I mentioned an issue or desire in passing it was acted upon immediately. This is a one-of-a-kind gem of a hotel. I would have loved to stay longer, unfortunately, we had to leave. The location is perfect and obscure.  But don't worry. Most taxi drivers in London know its location. Strongly recommend you stay there, even for a short stay, and be prepared to be treated like royalty.  The stay was unforgettable and it is our location of choice on a future visit to London!"
May 2014,Wonderful service!,"I would just like to reiterate what others have said.  I booked this hotel following all the great reviews as a 60th birthday surprise for my mum and I was not disappointed.    After a very early morning flight, my mum and I were greeted very warmly with a glass of Champagne and were told we had been upgraded!  We sat in the Executive lounge, taking in all the beautiful surroundings whilst we waited for Eggs Benedict (which I would strongly recommend)!  You were made to feel very relaxed and encouraged to soak up the atmosphere.   There was food in abundance.  You will never go hungry and Stefan was always on had with a glass of Champagne!    The hotel is ideally situated for Victoria station and Harrods is only a 20 minute walk away. The hotel staff are very knowledgeable, are…"
May 2014,AMAZING!!!,"On arrival to this gem of a hotel, we were upgraded to their beautiful executive suite, we were given a glass of Champagne and shown all the facilities. We were shown to our room and instantly fell in love with it.  The staff were so helpful, they really couldn't do enough for us. We would go back without hesitation and would recommend this wonderful hotel to anyone."
May 2014,A truly unique and fabulous experience! ,"I have to say that this hotel has the extras you don't usually get in a 5 star hotel.  First the staff was almost like a very polite and hospital family,  you felt directly at home and treated us like one of their own. Second, the service!!!! Outstanding thought to details and creating an atmosphere where you as guest could feel total relaxation.  Third, the lounge was so delicate and superbly designed that you felt time was slowing down and a feeling of total calmness was surging thru you like a warm bries on a nice summer night.  "
May 2014,"Lovely, luxurious boutique hotel","This hotel is small and very intimate.  The location is perfect, close to everything but quiet as well.  The service is amazing!  The lounge is a very nice feature - we went almost every night before dinner for a relaxing drink and complimentary snacks.  The rooms are a very nice size and the bathroom was lovely too.  We would absolutely return!"
May 2014,awesome sevices,"The staff was the best!!! They treated us like royalty. They always had smiles on their faces, always ready for recommendations for places to eat, how to get to various locations by taxi or train.We loved London and would come back again and probably stay here just for the service that the staff gives. its simply the best for the  short stay."
April 2014,Excellent English Style,"What a great hotel in such a perfect location, in the heart of the city very close to all the major shopping, nightlife and attractions.  Hotel 41 is a hotel within a hotel, its the top floor of another hotel and a very stylish and comfortable space.  Surprisingly large for downtoen london and a very solid staff.  Loved the hotel and the area"
June 2014,Superb Service,"We have stayed at Hotel 41 a couple of times before and this time was for our honeymoon. From the second you arrive your every need is catered for and you feel truly spoiled. All the staff are polite, friendly, efficient and fantastic at making you feel special.  It's not only the general level of service but the little extra thoughtful things that make it a delight to stay here.  If you want luxury and the very best level of service I have found anywhere then this is the place for you.  Love it. Just wish I could afford to stay there more often!"
June 2014,"""Bea"" looked after!","We spent five nights at 41 in London during Wimbledon.   We travel to London nearly every year, but this was our first stay at this hotel.   In terms of location, when you check in, you will be neighbors with the Queen as Buckingham Palace is around the corner.   As for convenience in getting to anywhere in London, you are a few steps away from Victoria Station that connects to every major line.  This hotel is much like “Platform 9 ¾” in the Harry Potter books – you need to know about it to see it!  A black and white awning branded with the number “41” hides away a small walk in lobby manned with one of the seemingly dozens of welcoming staff who tend to your every need.  During odd hours, the property is accessed with your keycard.  The heart of the hotel is the magnificent…"
May 2014,"Comfortable, cozy and welcoming","41 Hotel is not a super high-end hotel.  It is a welcoming ,warm comfortable little hotel with a meticulous style and staff.  It has a great location just across from the Mews where the carriages for Buckingham Palace are housed, and right up the street from The Palace.  There is some serious construction nearby - the rebuilding of Victoria Station, but it didn't cause any problems for those of us staying at the hotel.  This is an unusual hotel idea - the housing of a small boutique hotel within (on one floor)  a larger hotel.  You enter off the street where there is a desk and attendant who can help with pretty much anything, and go up in the elevator to the hotel.  You are guided through several hallways  past guest rooms to the main reception room where everything happens. …"
June 2014,Perfect luxury in the heart of London,"We have stayed in London on many occasions but after a friend's recommendation we booked Hotel 41 for the last few days of a month's holiday in Europe. We were certainly not disappointed as the quiet ""club"" atmosphere, luxurious rooms and amenities were outstanding. The staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and professionalism - right from the welcome champagne to our evening departure for Heathrow. Arrangements were made on our behalf without hesitation or fuss. The availability of snacks and substantial evening food in the lounge was a bonus. Lauren and the front desk staff were wonderful and we can't wait to visit again!"
June 2014,Conservatory Suite...Perfection!,"I must admit I had never heard of Hotel 41 when my husband told me he had chosen this hotel for our anniversary stay in London.  However I knew it would be good as he had selected it because of its superb Trip Advisor reviews. What we hadn't  anticipate was how fabulous our stay would be!!!  From the moment we arrived through the doors we experienced fantastic customer service.  We were offered champagne by the Stephan the most unique, eccentric, likeable member of the Hotel 41 team.  Such a wonderful way to welcome us.    The decor in the Executive Lounge is sumptuous and luxurious.  The skylight ceiling allowing the afternoon sunshine to flood into the room.   We later returned to this room in the evening to relax and enjoy a complementary drink and ice cream.    When we were…"
September 2013,The Finest Experience in Service and Beautiful Suites,When visiting London Hotel 41 is a must!  Absolute perfection from the minute you enter the front door.  The entire staff was accommodating and genuinely concerned with exceeding all of our expectations.  Our dining experiences for breakfast and dinner were excellent.   During our stay we had a family emergency back in the US and the Executive Lounge was a very comforting environment for us to spend time. The staff was attentive but not intrusive.
June 2014,Perfect for single traveler,"I had one night to spend by myself in London before meeting my group.  This was exactly what I wanted.  There is a pleasant lounge where you can get a simple meal in a club like atmosphere. I do not like going out to dinner alone so this was perfect. I noticed families enjoyed this feature as well.  The staff was amazing.  As soon as I checked in everyone knew my name. I  do not know how they do it. I wanted a luxury stay for the night and this definitely met the desire.  It is within walking distance of the the pageantry of Buckingham Palace, the city's beautiful parks and historic buildings."
May 2014,London's Top Hotel,This is truly the finest hotel in London. This is quite a statement as London has a mulltitude of excellent hotels. I have never received the level of attention  in decades of travel spanning several continents as I encountered at this hotel. The room was also truly beautiful. THis was a trip I will always cherish.
April 2014,Fantastic !,"You know you have entered a quality hotel, no sooner are you through the door and the friendly staff have taken your bags and offered you a glass of champaign or fine wine.  There is only 2 floors to this hotel the entrance and the 5th floor here all the rooms are situated and the dining room stroke bar area, they work on a honesty bar with all named drinks and if you can't find what your looking for the helpful staff will soon find it or mix it up  We only had breakfast here but that was really well made we have already said we will be staying here again in no time At all"
May 2014,Fabulous !,"No review can adequately convey how fabulous this hotel is.  The service is the best.  They have a whatever, whenever button on phone and that sums it up.  Every request we had, they fulfilled.  They can fast track tickets for most anything.  The lounge is very nice with breakfast in a.m. Then snacks all day into evening included.  A honor bar is available ( glass of very good champagne is offered upon arrival complimentary).  We had an executive king room that was a nice size and very comfortable bed.  All of the staff are so friendly and helpful!!  Good location and great wi-fi.  We will return."
May 2014,"Lovely Location, Lovely Staff","The first thing you notice when you enter this cosy English hotel is the courteous and well mannered staff. Everyone laughs and smiles, and just make you happy! They ask if they can help at every point.   Apart from the staff, the great thing about this hotel is their little knick knacks that are laid out throughout the day, to help fill in the little gaps in your stomach. I always looked forward to see what was in store after spending a good day in London.  Their rooms are quite English to begin with. Quite cosy. Their beds are like feathers. I almost always slept within minutes once I was on them.   Overall a lovely stay!"
May 2014,The BEST of many fabulous hotels in London!,"This is only the second time I have felt moved to write a hotel review--this place is THAT special. I have stayed at other excellent luxury hotels in London before but decided on Hotel 41 this time and I was absolutely thrilled!  I was in town alone visiting friends for a few days and the extraordinary staff made me feel completely at home.  I really cannot say enough about them.  Every single person went out of their way to be welcoming and helpful.  I found myself catching up on work each night in the ""lobby"" which is actually more like a library or drawing room in a private home with comfortable chairs and sofas with tables set and food and drink available 'round the clock.  My room was comfortable and impeccably clean.  I can't wait to go back and I am recommending the 41 to…"
May 2014,It's so nice returning to this hotel,"I would like to thank the staff at hotel 41 for making my stay such a pleasant and enjoyable one. I was in London two years ago and visited this hotel for the first time. The staff were so friendly and professional that I decided to return to the hotel again when I was recently in London.  The staff have lost none of their charm and dedication towards the guest. They really are the best staff of any hotel that I have stayed at in the world (and I do not say this lightly).  I would like to thank in particular Monica, Simone, Stefan and David. Nothing is too much trouble for these people and they made my stay another memorable one.  I will happily recommend this hotel to any one who wants not only a stay but an experience in London too. I look forward to returning to the hotel in…"
May 2014,Another Crown Jewel of London,"If you are looking for a small, luxury, boutique hotel, look no further.  While the location, rooms, amenities and food are all outstanding, it is the service that puts the hotel in a class by itself.  This is by far the best service that I ever have been accorded in any European or Asian hotel I have stayed in.  Lauren and Monika and their entire hotel staff were wonderful in assisting with theatre tickets, hard to get dinner reservations and shopping suggestions.   On this trip (April 30-May 4) I was traveling with a friend, but I can't wait to pay a return visit to the hotel with my husband!  Jacqueline P."
May 2014,What a gem!,"We spent 2 days at Hotel 41 after a 15 day transatlantic repositioning cruise on a small cruise ship.  We had been terribly spoiled by the service on the ship, and we were unsure of what Hotel 41 would be like.  The service in the hotel was unbelievably fabulous.  We were pampered from the moment we arrived right through our departure.  The staff was attentive, friendly and very, very professional.  Anything and everything we asked for was seen to with a smile.  The hotel's location is but a few steps from Buckingham Palace and is just a short walk to Westminster Abbey and Parliament.  Other London attractions, if not within walking distance, are easily accessed by nearby public transit.  Our very comfortable room, like the rest of the hotel, was immaculate.  Staying at Hotel 41…"
May 2014,"Truly 5 Star, excellent service","We were warmly greeted by Victoria on our arrival. Lauren gave us the orientation ""tour"". All the rooms are on one floor, as well as the executive lounge where we were seated and offered breakfast while being checked in.  Due to our transatlantic flight we arrived very early but they still allowed us to check in and provided us with a room about 30 min later.  The room may be on the smaller side by American standards but is adequate and well appointed. They put in those extra touches that I love like a bathroom scale! Full length mirror, dimmable lights and reading lights, Penhaligon toiletries  The executive lounge is most likely where u will have breakfast or a late night snack and utilize the concierge to make plans for the day. The room has a great domed skylight which is…"
April 2014,Perfect Honeymoon!,"From the moment we arrived to the moment we left everything was perfect. We were a week in London on our honeymoon and all the staff in 41 went out of their way to make it a very special occasion for us. We were treated to drinks and canapes on arrival. We had cake, fruit and water in our room. What surprised us the most though was the attention to detail. The staff noted what we wanted to do for the week and then helped us at every opportunity to make it better.   Our room was beautiful and so comfortable. The bed in particular was so comfy. The room and bathroom were spotless. The food in the hotel was delicious. Raiding the pantry is a must! It was so useful on our return from the theater on one of the nights. The food on offer is varied and always fresh. We were spoiled for…"
May 2014,Great atmosphere ! Spotlessly clean Hotel!,Amazing Staff !! the room was spotlessly clean!!! We had a wonderful stay !!  Location was amazing  next to all the theatres and Victoria station we will be back ! Forgot to say the beds were really comfortable and the design of the rooms we liked very much
April 2014,Simply excellent...........,Meeting friends flying in from the US and we needed somewhere to stay that was going to tick all the right boxes. Can't fault a thing. Need somewhere that does everything a 5 star hotel should do then this is the place. Will return again when next in London.
April 2014,Amazing experience,This hotel is a truly amazing experience.You are spoilt from the moment you are shown through the front door. The staff are incredible and make you feel very special  When in London we will not stay anywhere else. What a find !!!
April 2014,Superb!,"We stayed here after seeing it as the #1 spot on trip advisor.  Let me be the first to tell you that this will be the only place we stay when visiting London in the future.  The staff are second to none making you feel like family and royalty in a very homey way. We were attending a wedding so we had plenty of dining experiences but every time we came back to our hotel they seemed to top it w something even better. From the unique tasty appetizers to the cold bar w freshly sliced Salmon, cheeses paté and much more, available till the wee hours of the am. Open bar, ice cream, champagne and goid rum which is hard to come across sometimes in Europe,  they had it all. Well done guys, David , z German,  and the entire staff who made it AWESOME! !!!"
April 2014,"5* exclusive, intimate, felt like a VIP","Just stayed at hotel 41 and it was a one of a kind experience. Upon welcome to the hotel you are made to feel important and special. It has an exclusive feel to it with only a few rooms, small reception area and lovely lounge area. All the extra touches are very special. Drink on arrival. Personal greeter. Personal check in. Rooms are lovely. Beautifully decorated and have everything you need including a fireplace. Our DVD player didn't work but the staff worked non stop until it did and they could not do enough to make up for it including bringing cocktails to our room and wavering the drinks we had throughout our stay. The pantry was amazing. We didn't need to eat out. Good quality ingredients which can be said for breakfast also which was amazing. Hope to return soon. It…"
March 2014,Just fantastic!,We stayed at Hotel 41 as a belated 30th Wedding Anniversary celebration and had also booked to go on the Raymond Blanc dinner on the Orient Express.  We were treated like royalty by the hotel staff from the moment we arrived until we left and I can safely say that this was the best hotel experience we have ever had.  We were upgraded to a junior suite and the room was superb and the bed massive and comfortable.  The staff were attentive and considerate at all times and made the stay perfect for us both.    Many thanks to all at the hotel for making this trip so much more enjoyable and we would not hesitate to return - in fact I am really looking forward to it!!
April 2014,All around perfection!!,"Me and my girlfriend, stayed here for five days in April 2014. From the start to our departure everything was amazing, the staff were extremely helpful and beyond accommodating, the food was amazing, and all around just incredible! The only negative is the shadow this has cast on our current hotel in Venice, if we are in London again we will definitely be returning!"
May 2013,Great hotel & great experience.,Great hotel & great experience.  I've stayed here once with the Soho was fully booked and could not have been more pleased.  The rooms each have character and the hotel staff is very accommodating.  I highly recommend this hotel.
November 2013,Luxury!,I had the pleasure of staying at this amazing hotel last year. what can I say but wow! Everything was perfect from our arrival to our departure! The staff are very welcoming and hard working! Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone!
February 2014,Amazing hotel & staff,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying here for 4 nights in February, 2014.  We splurged and booked the conservatory suite.  Everything from check-in to departure was perfect.  The room was absolutely beautiful with all the amenities you could need.  Having the extra space was very comfortable.  The staff, each and everyone, truly went above and beyond to make sure you enjoyed your stay.  The snacks and treats in the lounge were wonderful and we were able to take advantage of ""plundering the pantry"" a few times.  This was our first time to London and the location worked out perfectly for everything we wanted to do.  It seemed as though everything was within walking distance.  You really feel as though you're in your own private little part of London.   Thank you to all the…"
April 2014,Its Amazing,"what an excellent experience, from arrival to departure the service is world class. The staff know who you are and are extremely welcoming and totally efficient.  champagne on arrival, clear explanation of how anything works. In the room that have thought, and do think of everything. We had his and his slipper bags as opposed to standard his and hers.  Personal notes in the room handwritten. Every T is crossed and every I is dotted.  LOVED IT"
December 2013,Like a comfortable pair of slippers,Everything about Hotel 41 was carefully and thoughtfully planned to provide a luxury yet unobtrusive experience. From champagne at check in through to little personal touches in the room. The location of the hotel is excellent and the room was quiet ensuring a good nights sleep. The lounge served a great breakfast too! All in all a great hotel 
December 2013,To be taken care of is worth trying once in a while.,"41 is a small hotel. And small is beautiful a wise man said. He didn't think of 41, but who knows? This place is more a poem, or a work of art, than a hotel. It is not a base camp, it is the peak. You just don't want to leave the bed, the breakfast in bed, the fireplace, the mahogany shrine were afternoon tea or glowing wine is served under the glass roof. Very intimate, but not in an embarrassing manner.The staff is young and tenderly responding to all your needs without showing off. The waiters are descrete in a manner that challenges your pride.  Tranquille, but precise and to the point. British? I think so. Even the lampets have their own rythm. God must have smiled when he created 41 through the imagination of Bea Tollman. When I left I knew that this hotel will be more a…"
December 2013,Great place to stay,This place is really pricey but this is where i stay if im in london for businees or pleasure. I have been to many other estabs over the years but they give you the best. If youre a regular they give extra special srvice.
December 2013,Perfect weekend stay,"I've stayed at Hotel 41 previously and am more than pleased to say that it just doesn't change, you get friendly, attentive service with excellent efficiency, politeness and everything to the high standard you expect, having stayed in most of the top London hotels in the past since discovering 41 I will not stay anywhere else."
December 2013,"Wonderful,wonderful,wonderful!!!","My lovely husband booked a surprise birthday treat for me and we combined a stay at Hotel 41 with a visit to the theatre.  From literally the moment the taxi stopped outside Hotel 41 we were met by warm, attentive staff and nothing was too much trouble. The service was the best we had received anywhere.  Our room was a much needed peaceful haven, every detail was considered.  The quality of linens, towels and fittings are exceptional.  The phone has a button ""anything,anytime"" and that really does sum up the room service.  Upon arrival you are greeted with champagne, what a treat  - very good champagne!!  The food is superb and plundering the pantry after walking back from the theatre was most welcome.  The cheeses, hams, bread and fruit were just amazing, no leftovers here all…"
December 2013,Special Hotel for a Special Occasion,"Excellent service from very professional and caring members of staff in a superb well located boutique hotel with outstanding food, drink and facilities. Traveling to London to receive an award from the Queen was special enough but such an occasion was further enhanced through the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41."
January 2013,super,"Nothing realy special to say because everything was perfect. Thank  you Rooms clean and confortable, fireplace, staff very friendly, central location. We look forward to our return in London. Thank you de ""41"""
November 2013,Family trip to London,"My wife and I had enjoyed our stay at this hidden gem in 2010, and on this trip we brought our 3 children, ages 8, 11 and 16, for a 6 day vacation, their first transatlantic journey.  The junior suites were perfectly sized, and the kids made full use of the ""pantry"" every night.  The central location was an excellent base for adventures within and without the city limits.  If we ever return to London, we will want to stay at ""41""."
December 2013,Excellence in every respect!,"5 star boutique hotel. Extremely friendly staff. Incredibly nice people! They seem to know your name before you introduce yourself to the concierge. Nice and comfortable rooms, cozy living room for breakfast, snacks and drinks. You feel at home."
April 2013,I need to come back!,"This is most definitely my favourite hotel in London. The staff could not do enough for you, the rooms were a great size and the lounge made the hotel have that special touch.   The hotel itself is a joy to just roam around and enjoy the hotel setting, particularly a glass of champagne in front of the fire.   The prices for the rooms seem extremely reasonable in comparison to other 5* hotels on offer in the area we have stayed at.  The only downside was our shower did leak slightly, however we did not complain as it was not that much of a concern at the time! Definitely not enough to make us have a negative thought of this exceptional hotel.  I look forward to my return."
October 2013,We loved it!,"My family recently stayed at ""41"" for several nights. It was fantastic. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. We especially enjoyed having tea in the lounge by the fire. It was a great location - close to the tube and centrally located. Beautiful furnishings and very comfortable. But it was the staff that really made our experience at 41 so great. They did a great job!"
October 2013,What a friendly place!,My wife and I stayed at the 41 foe 3 days in early October. Super friendly staff.  They are always there to help.  Enjoy the delicious snacks they put out throughout the day.  Great location...stones throw to Buckingham palace. Five minute walk to the tube.   This is a great hotel which added toast fantastic stay in London.
August 2013,London,Amazing luxury boutique hotel!!! The service was great and the traditional decor was so comfortable.  It felt like I was in someones traditional mansion rather than a hotel.  The consierge made all my reservations and printed maps.  The would hail my taxi and exchange my money.  Great intimate ambiance.       
April 2013,My favorite hotel in the world.,"My husband and I visited this fine hotel in spring 2011. We brought our 18 month old daughter along. My husband arranged for a car to pick us up at Heathrow and bring us to the hotel. It was a very smooth process and we felt comfortably immediately under the care of PJ. The service and staff are second to none. Everyone knew our daughters name and gave her special attention. We didn't have room to bring our stroller on an international flight, so they loaned us a pink umbrella stroller. The location is just around the corner from Buckingham Palace and within easy walking distance from the train station and the theaters. We enjoyed our stay so much. I want to go back every year.              "
October 2013,"Incredible hotel, impeccable service","Just spent a week with a friend at Hotel 41.  I can't say enough about the staff.  Not only were they formally attired and well groomed, they were friendly, helpful and available for your every need. They also remembered what your plans were for the day and then followed up by asking how the show, tour, etc. was.  We were two women traveling alone and, above all, I felt safe there.  The front door of the hotel is locked and manned.  The elevator goes only up to the 5th floor where all of the rooms are located.  The hotel is spotless.  We had an executive room which was a small bedroom area and a separate sitting area.  The room contained all of the necessities one could imagine.  The bed was very comfortable and there is a pillow menu.  Our room faced inward and was extremely…"
October 2013,Couldn't Have Been Better,"My husband and I just spent a week at Hotel 41 after a wonderful shorter stay last Fall. We travel a great deal, including many trips to London, and this is, without question, our favorite hotel. Our room was wonderful - comfortable, spotlessly clean, and with every amenity, but the service is what sets Hotel 41 apart.  Everyone we encountered made us feel as if nothing would  be too much trouble and the entire staff was friendly without being intrusive. We unexpectedly met up with some friends from home while in London, on a stormy afternoon.  We .brought them back to Hotel 41 with us (without notice to the Hotel) so we could chat in the Executive Lounge, which is a beautiful room with a fireplace, comfortable seating areas, and  a small bar area (including complimentary ice…"
September 2013,Perfect Hotel,"This is a perfect small boutique hotel in the thick of things in London. From our first conversation with Shameela to when I received the microphone in the mail in the United States from Hotel 41 which I accidentally left behind, nothing was too much for the staff of this hotel to make your stay with them as pleasurable as possible. The breakfast, the cappuccinos, the snacks, simply everything, was prepared properly and was delicious. I like the fact that they would bring some olives and snacks to your room about 4 PM to assist you in making a cocktail. If you ask for something at this hotel, they will find a way to get it for you. We stayed on the consierge floor which I highly recommend. This is a hotel that will certainly impress your significant other. Sure, it costs more…"
October 2013,Magnificent Atmosphere & Service,"This is a small hotel that occupies the 5th floor of an older building just a block away from  Buckingham Palace.  From the minute you check in, you realize that you are in for a superlative customer service experience. The staff - meticulously dressed in formal wear - attends to your every request.  Although the rooms have been very nicely remodeled and have terrific atmosphere, they are a bit unique and not appropriate for the traveler that wants a big cookie cutter room, but they are charming and really fun.  Ours was a suite on two floors, with a small sitting room in the ground floor with a fireplace, and a nice sized bedroom on the top floor.  The bathroom was large, complete with a tub that had it's own television.  The best part of the place is the guest lounge where…"
October 2013,Week in London,"I stayed at the hotel 41 for a week and from the minute we arrived to getting in the taxi to leave we were treated impeccably the staff were fantastic the room was excellent there was nothing I could fault and would recommend the hotel to everyone, I will definatly be staying here again the next time I'm in London"
October 2013,Nothing is too much trouble,"The service was impeccable,  the staff were delightful, the food wonderful.  I have never been to a hotel where you are actually made to feel so welcome and I've been to many many hotels around the world.  If I have anything negative to say is that the bedroom was quite small but it was beautifully presented"
November 2013,AMAZING!,"Hotel 41 was beautiful! Me and My boyfriend went for his birthday. Firstly the champagne reception was fantastic. Then we got a very detailed check in. We had been downgraded but they made up for it with a free bottle of champagne and free breakfast. We then got t our room and were astonished about how beautiful it was. Everything in black and white & very cosy. The bed was extremely soft and the best bed I have ever slept in! My boyfriend helped himself to the mini bar for a fee, quite expensive but well worth it! Also he made full use of the snack bar and honesty bar, which he loved! The best part was they had free haagen daas! The products in the room were divine which I made full use of having a bit of a pamper before dinner. We went out for dinner but It was very…"
October 2013,Simply the best,"My fiancé and I stayed here the night we got engaged Oct13, and what can I say other than it was worth every penny.   We were upgraded free of charge to the conservatory suite which is phenomenal, I had requested a romantic turndown which was fabulous.   And the customer service was some of the best I've experienced in any walk of life.   My only niggle is something that the hotel obviously cannot help and that's the ongoing construction work which begin very early and was a tad loud.  Other than that exceptional."
October 2013,Fantastic place!,"Hotel 41 is such a great place to stay. The always present and super friendly staff in this cozy place with its amazing interior will make you love your hotel stay in London. Food was nice and the concept of an honesty bar adds the extra trust flavour to you feeling at home.  On the scale, from 0-10, this was a clear 10 for me. I have already recommended Hotel 41 to many friends and colleagues. Will be back :-)"
October 2013,Excellent stay,"I went on a business trip to London a while back and I stayed at Hotel 41 because a friend recommended it to me, and I must say it was an excellent choice. The rooms are extremely clean, spacious and luxurious, and the bed was amazingly comfortable. The location is also great, being very near to places like Hyde Park or the Buckingham Palace, and the overall facilities here are definitely accommodating to any need you may have. I will surely stay here again the next time I`m in London, and I highly recommend it to everyone."
October 2013,Outstanding service,"We travelled to London as a couple in October for the celebration of a 50th birthday. Was fortunate to have 2 nights at the this hotel. Because this is a smaller boutique hotel, it allows it's staff to lavish attention on to the patrons. From the complementary champagne upon check in, to the ""Whatever/Whenever"" function on the phone (which we took advantage of),  the staff at the Hotel 41 were some of the most gracious and attentive we have experienced. The room was excellent, with beautiful decor, and little details such as the bedside ""Do Not Disturb"" switch were nice. By booking through the hotel web site, we were able to take advantage of additional perks such as Champagne in the room on our arrival. The added surprise of birthday cake was a welcome treat. We had a wonderful…"
October 2013,Excellent--that's all there is to say,"Well, the title says it all.    I was in London for a work trip combined with a wedding.  I was staying at the ""luxury"" Draycott.  It was not a good experience.  So I moved to Hotel 41 and I'm glad I did.    The staff were exceptional in their friendliness and standards.  The room was spotless and very well taken care off."
November 2013,If you know what you want...,"This is the perfect spot. If you want the Bellagio, with grand public spaces, huge rooms, 6 restaurants-- you'll end up being one of the 1-2 star reviews. If you want delightful service, incredibly relaxing, quiet atmosphere, great tourist location, easy breakfast and great noshing in the evening-- this is the spot. I put 4 stars here just because I can see how someone looking for a glamorous 5 star show would be disappointed. But if you're looking for small ( and it helps to be small-- beds/chairs are all compact) quiet elegance that feels like a hideaway from the real world-- this will work very nicely. Smashing!"
November 2013,wow. amazing! its like home only better!,"this is a tucked away small (28 room) luxury hotel located near buckingham palace. for me it was convenient to anywhere.  i flew overnight to london and got to the hotel at 8 am. my room was ready! they knew my name (and i hadn't stayed there before) they brought me fresh piping hot coffee, and then took me to where i could get (free) continental breakfast!  my room was a bit small...okay for me, but for two people it probably would've been too tight. great linens, great amenities, nice tv, decent view.  the beauty of this hotel is how well one is treated. at the end of the day i went to the executive lounge, which is the heart of the hotel. they made me drinks, brought me canapé, helped me get dinner reservations, and were so friendly i felt like i knew them for a long time. …"
October 2013,Great Hotel!!!,"Great hotel, great location, great service. There is a reason they are number 3 on the list, even though they should be higher. My wife and I only stayed for 4 days, but by the end of the stay they knew us by name and how we liked our tea. We had friends staying at the Waldorf Astoria, and they wanted to change to Hotel 41."
October 2013,Five star luxury with a personal touch,"Hotel 41 is small hotel with only 30-some rooms and beside a board room (meeting room) and an executive lounge arrive this is all the facilities there are but they are used to the max.  Rooms are all equipment with all that could be expected of 5 star hotel - Furniture, fabrics and toiletries are all of highest quality. The bed is good.... all is good  What brings 41 to be one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had is the concept of the hotel and the personal attention of a very limited but always present staff  The center and core of the concept is the fantastic lounge where you mingle with staff and the limited number for other guests - The lounge offers various treats and snacks during the day. You can make yourself a drink and you can order food etc all while your are…"
September 2013,Loved. It.,Wow. Our stay at Hotel 41 came at the end of a trip where we had already experienced some excellent accommodations so our bar was set pretty high. Let's just say that Hotel 41 exceeded our expectations in so many ways. From the moment that we arrived we were made to feel special. Actually the great service started even before we arrived as I had been in contact with their concierge who were very helpful in making recommendations and arranging airport transport via email.   This hotel actually occupies the top floor of the building which also holds the Rubens Hotel. It has a separate entrance that is locked and manned making it feel very exclusive.  We had a interior facing room so no view but that may have been a blessing because the streets sound as though they may be a bit…
September 2013,Fabulous Hotel,"On company business we stayed one night at Hotel 41.   From the moment you walk in you are looked after by amazing staff. We were made to feel extremely welcome, had a wonderful room, the extras in the room were most appreciated, the bathroom was luxurious and the bed extremely comfortable. Although we did not make use of the 24 hour buffet it look wonderful as did the honesty bar. The cooked breakfast in the morning was delicious. We left wishing we could stay longer and would have no hesitation in recommending it to friends."
September 2013,Exceptional Service and Attention to Detail,"Hotel 41 is actually the fifth floor of the Rubens Hotel building, accessed by a separate entrance. It is characterized by an exceptional level of service and attention to detail from the staff. My company was conducting business in London and the board room at 41 was ideal. Throughout my three days there I was treated like a special guest and in a genuinely friendly manner. My room was especially well-equipped - the bathroom was large and the king-sized bed very comfortable - and little touches like a fruit hamper were much appreciated. Everything about the place is five-star and I found no fault. As a Yorkshireman I never imagined I could consider $600 a night for a hotel to be good value, but for this quality of experience I do think so and wouldn't hesitate in recommending…"
September 2013,"Small, intimate and very special","We stayed at Hotel 41 last Tuesday night to be near to Victoria Station.  It literally took my breath away.  Secreted on 5th floor (formally the ballroom) of the Rubens hotel, 41 is so special and true luxury.  Yes you do pay for it, however you certainly get the service and quality you would expect - and some.  The staff are so friendly, helpful and efficient and the decor throughout is amazing.  Definitely will be saving up to go back again.  Fabulous place for couples to celebrate a special occasion."
October 2012,Oasis with great service,"We had the pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for our final night in London during the Olympics.  We had rented a flat for the previous 2 weeks and treated ourselves on our last night at Hotel 41 to celebrate our anniversary.  The hotel was an oasis in a central and hectic part of London.  The room was spacious and beautiful, but what really stood out were the staff and the level of service.  They truly provided a memorable ending to a great experience in London.  Next time, we plan on staying for more than one night!"
July 2013,Best Hotel in London,My son and I spent a lovely week at Hotel 41 in July.  We felt that Hotel 41 was our home and oasis during our visit to London.  The staff's attention to detail and to the needs of each guest are beyond excellent.  I am a seasoned traveler and can say that I have never experienced the level of personal attention and care that we received at Hotel 41.  The staff is simply the best.  The rooms are well appointed and spacious by London standards.   This hotel is truly a gem and from now on the only place I will stay in London.  I stongly recommend Hotel 41.
September 2013,Honeymoon night - could not have picked a better hotel!,"We LOVED Hotel 41! It's very boutique, right on Buckingham Palace Rd. It feels like there are only 5 rooms even though there are 30. The attention to detail of the staff was amazing! We had rose petals strewn on the bed and around the bath, candles lit and a fire! The gorgeous lounge with free delicious nibbles and drinks is divine.  The continental breakfast offering was beyond expectations - in fact that just sums up the whole place. Incredible. And I stay in a LOT of 5 star places.... I wish we could have stayed longer - and eaten some of the food that is written about in the lovely recipe book. Charming, completely customer focused personal care and service - nothing is too much trouble. Well worth it.  We just can't fault it and are saving to come back next time!"
August 2013,Return trip,"I was lucky enough to return to 41 For my birthday after staying in June. It was better then I remembered and we had a fab time. The staff are all lovely, the food is very good and although not as central as some I really like the location, there is always something going on around the palace. I for one can't wait to go back, a lovely oasis in London! "
July 2013,Best hotel in London,"We booked for a 3 night ""get more from your stay package"" in July with my husband. Being in the travel industry myself this hotel offers a special experience. Not only are you offered a glass of champagne at check in, you are offered a choice of champagne . The room was spacious for London, photos do not do it justice, good quality furnishings and bedding with some special small touches which are impressive. The staff were friendly without being intrusive. Afternoon tea was excellent, I just love afternoon tea! Best steak ever in the Rubins Library restaurant. Enough said see you soon No 41"
August 2013,A Hidden Gem,"My Friend and I stayed here for a night whilst visiting London. We both needed a treat and this Hotel hit the spot. The staff are friendly and very helpful, and the rooms are stunning with every comfort. After returning from the theatre we made good use of the Pantry and shared cheeses and a glass of wine. The afternoon tea was as good as any I have had at the Ritz or The Savoy. Well done to all the team, and I will take my husband next time"
August 2013,"Wonderful hotel, Amazing Staff","My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for one week while on vacation in London. Hotel 41 was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in! The staff is incredibly thoughtful and whole experience from check-in to check-out was first class.  The room was much bigger than I would have ever expected. It was my first time in London, but I was expecting a NYC or Chicago sized room. Our room was very comfortable and the bathroom was huge.  We spent many hours in the lounge during our weeklong stay as we had breakfast every morning and many a London Pride in the afternoon and evening. We had never experienced a full English breakfast before and enjoyed sampling every breakfast item available on the menu, including the Kippers. The absolute best thing on the breakfast menu is the smoked…"
September 2013,Amazing stay in London,"We stayed at this hotel for our wedding in the capital.  The hotel is beautiful, the decor is very elegant throughout.  The hotel staff made it a stay to remember, it made our stay even more memorable.  Their attention to detail is fantastic.  We cant wait to stay again!"
August 2013,Very romantic,"We stayed here on our wedding night and it was perfect. The staff were so so friendly and extremely accommodating. You're treated like royalty! It's definitely different and has it own character. Hugely unique. Lovely themed rooms, cute boutique, very contemporary. Feels like a home away from home. Its quite small and the visit was v personal. Lots of personal touches in the room too. Thank you to all the staff for an amazing visit."
September 2013,Excellent indeed,"Old fashioned but stylish hotel in front of Buckingham Palace. You feel like transported in the 19th Century. This is really charming, enchanting, and a change to have people taking care of you all the time. Service is top of the line. Pricey though, but you cannot have this kind of service for peanuts, ( peanuts are free, by the way). I would recommend it, this is really the Bristish experience. I felt like a Princess."
September 2013,Excellent service,"The staff is focused on making your stay as pleasant as possible. It's a great small hotel, rooms are complete but small. 20 minutes walking distance from the mayor shopping areas. There are many good restaurants on walking distance. "
May 2013,Best hotel in Europe,"I actually never write reviews and always look at this site for other people's recommendations!  However, I felt compelled to take the time to write about Hotel 41.  This hotel, hands down, has been the most comfortable, friendly and service orientated hotel I have stayed in Europe.  I travel quite frequently throughout Europe and through London, each time I make sure I stay here.  Monika and Lauren go out of there way to take care of me, my clients and my fiance whenever we are here.  Down to having my favorite beer chilled in the room upon arrival.  Seriously, this is the place to stay in London, once you stay here, you will never stay anywhere else in the city."
September 2013,"If you are in London, explore Hotel 41.  Amazingly feels humble!!","My husband and I had one post-cruise night at Hotel 41 in London, a short walking distance from the Buckingham Palace.  I am telling you their services from the housekeeping services to the general manager was at 20 out of scale 1 to 10.  We have had stayed many hotels around the world but, I mean, this hotel is the best.  Why?  It is a classy boutique style hotel and its staff made you felt like, 'you are a prince/princess' behind the Buckingham Palace building. I tell you they are not fake or business in mind.  They are so natural in pleasing their guests and we feel too humble at their services.  it was truly refreshing.......for their style of graceful services. If you are looking for a hotel in London, you wouldn't ever be sorry for staying this Hotel 41. If we visit London…"
September 2013,Best Part of Our Trip,"My mom and I recently traveled to London for the first time.  We did many of the usual sightseeing things and loved the city, but we both decided that the BEST part of our visit was this hotel. What a hidden gem just steps from Buckingham Palace.  You are treated like royalty the moment you step inside.  We expected the wonderful room but were blown away by the friendly service.  The executive lounge is the gathering location where soft music is playing, champagne is flowing,  the fireplace is alight, and cozy little tables are outfitted with linens, china, and candles.  You nestle into a variety of upholstered chairs and sofas, adjust your pillow, and the cares of your day drift away as the staff brings you hot canapes and glasses of champagne.  After spending an entire day…"
September 2013,Just Perfect!,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 for my husbands 50th birthday. The customer service and attention to detail was superb. We were made to feel very special and the staff were just delightful. From the moment you walk in the staff are make you feel extremely welcome. Our stay exceeded my expectations and made my husbands birthday very special. If you want exceptional service, attention to detail and comfort this is the place to stay."
September 2013,"A crown jewel, next to Buckingham Place","A wonderful stay and experience at Hotel 41. It was all about superb service, attention to detail, all with exceptional amenities, in a warm, comfortable environment. As noted in other reviews, Hotel 41 is located the top floor of the Rubens Hotel, accessed by a its own entrance. It is across from Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station is one block away.  On first arrival, you are greeted in lobby, and escorted to the Lounge on the 5th floor via private Hotel 41 elevator, where you check in while offered a glass of champagne, introduced to the hotel facilities and then escorted to your room. Our room was wonderful, with a  true king bed, dark wood furniture (desk, wardrobe, table and a couple of club chairs). Did I mention the working fireplace, with remote? The bathroom was…"
August 2013,The Hotel Staff helped to make our vacation wonderful.,"First time in London.  The staff at Hotel 41 were very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.  Had a wonderful time  The hotel was convenient to everything.  The Executive Lounge provided a perfect spot for breakfast and relaxation with a drink and snack after a day of site seeing  Overall great experience."
August 2013,The hotel to be in London,If you can spend some money in a extraordinary hotel be sure to book the Hotel 41. I have never seen suich efficient smooth and graceful service . We had a wonderful stay at this hotel which does not look as a hotel. Everything was just perfect.
August 2013,Best Boutique Hotel,"From the minute you enter the Hotel lobby until the time you checkout, you will have a wonderful experience.  The hotel is very unique, in fact it occupies the entire 5th floor of the adjacent Rubens Hotel.  It has a wonderful lounge where you can get a glass of wine, a late night snack or full service menu. The friendliness of the staff and the service they provide are unparalleled and they take care of your every request or need.  In my case they purchased for me several front of the line tickets to exhibitions in London and tickets for Billy Elliot.  I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there the next time I am in London."
August 2013,Another amazing stay at Hotel 41,"My husband and I first stayed here after our wedding last year, and had such a great experience that we promised we'd be back. And we've just been back...this time for my birthday. Hotel 41 did not disappoint. From the minute we walked in the door the service was exceptional. Room was great with lots of space and everything we needed. My husband had booked afternoon tea as a treat and it was amazing. The cakes were all designed with a celebration theme for Prince George which was lovely. I was also treated to a very unexpected birthday cake which was delicious! After going out for the evening we came back and ""plundered the pantry"" whilst drinking champagne in the lounge - incredibly relaxing place to spend time. Breakfast the following morning was excellent, as it was last time…"
August 2013,Interesting property that shake all day and late into the night,"I tried to stay here in August and had to move hotels due to the construction site across the street - the bed, hotel, everything was shaking as they drilled and dug and drilled again. It is a very interesting property - quite stylish, unique layout, and wonderfully helpful staff, but I do wonder what they are thinking when they book people in. It is not as if the construction sight is new, so why don't they warn you?  It got so bad that I had to move across town to another one of their fellow accommodations which was less than convenient. All in all, I would not recommend booking here until the construction is done - it is just not relaxing."
August 2013,Exceptional Service - Memorable Experience,"We spent 3 memorable nights at 41 last week and can say without reservation that 41 is the finest hotel in which my wife and I have had the pleasure of staying in over 30 years of travel for business and pleasure. The service was simply outstanding and without doubt the best we have ever experienced. The attention to detail and proactive approach of the staff is second to none. The hotel consists of only 28 rooms and is very cozy and warm. The Executive Lounge, with its unique atmosphere reminiscent of a mansion library, was the ideal setting in which to start our day with a great breakfast and in which to end our day with a night cap from a terrific selection of premium single malt scotch whiskies, wines, beer and spirits.  Consumption is based on the honor system and recorded…"
November 2012,Amazing!,"Hotel 41 is a fabulous place to stay. The atmosphere is beautiful, quiet, and lovey. It has delicious breakfast, perfect afternoon tea with champagne and a great night cap service with hors d'oeuvres and all; plus 24hr ice cream! I stayed here for three nights with my husband; we have two small children and would probably not stay here with them.  I think small children probably need a larger hotel with kid friendly activities/play center.  But if you want elegant pampered service, this is the place to stay.  They will pamper and cater to your every whim. This is a perfect London Hotel.  It sits across the street from Buckingham Palace, a short distance to pubs, shopping, and the tub and train stations.  Wonderful all around. I can’t wait to go back."
August 2013,An experience,"The second time that my wife and I have stayed at this hotel. Exceptional hotel, service and overall environment. Nothing is too much trouble and we will certainly stay again when we are next in London. Try the Champagne experience in the Leopards Bar - an excellent way to unwind. All of the food was cooked to a high standard and was delightful"
August 2013,Simply Outstanding!,"Well... I don't really know where to start to be honest!  Outstanding, Exceeded guests expectations, Amazing experience, 100% Guest satisfaction are all things that come to mind when trying to sum up my stay at Hotel41 London.  I stayed here a total of 5 nights / 6 days with Family (My Mum) and right from the time I was greeted at the main door on a Saturday night at 11:15pm to the time I left the same main door it was like a home away from home.  No matter what the query (small, large or insignificant) ALL the staff went above and beyond to help in any way they could which as a guest makes it just that much more reassuring and helps in enjoying the holiday!  In my profession customer service is absolutely crucial and Hotel41 showed exactly how it's done on all levels. Having…"
August 2013,"Like a catered, private flat","Where to start? You know how at most hotels there is usually one, maybe two people who run around and really have the ability to sort out whatever need or problem you have? Imagine a small luxury hotel with a battalion of people with that kind of star treatment attitude and authority. At the same time, the personal touch was never overbearing -- just enough to make sure we made full use of the hotel. Service is without a doubt outstanding.  The hotel itself is laid out like an eccentric rabbit warren of corridors -- you will find this either endearing or annoying. We found it endearing, and had an informal competition to see who could first find a route to the private elevator without recourse to going through the lounge.   The lounge itself is really the only common area of…"
June 2013,Great boutique hotel with fabulous service,"Believe the other reviews, on TA, the hotel is ideally situated right across from the Royal Mews and easy access to all of London.  But what really makes it great is the incredible staff and the service they provide.  Lauren and the rest of the staff are true gems, engaging in genuine conversation with the guests in the luxurious common room  and going out of their way to make our stay memorable.  I've been to London a few times but  this was the best ever thanks to the staff at Hotel 41.  Hats off to all of you."
July 2013,An Exquisite Charm,"We only stayed in London two nights, once on our travels to Paris and once on the way back home - had I known how lovely our stay would be at Hotel 41 I would have made arrangements to stay longer! The service was impeccable, the lodging and appointments uniquely British and extremely 5 star quality.  Malcolm arranged every detail of our stay, Stefan and the front desk staff welcomed us with champagne and Monica followed up to confirm that every aspect was perfect. I would thoroughly recommend this little charm to anyone visiting London for a first time or for the seasoned traveler looking for a lovely British property!"
July 2013,Exceptional service to make you feel at home,"You feel welcome from the moment you walk through the door. As a business traveller, lots of little things help ease work stress.  These include the lounge which has complimentary, excellent quality food always available, canapes daily from 18.00  and a community fridge with bottles of water you are welcome to take on your way out. The tables in the lounge are spaced so you have privacy, where you can work somewhere other than your room.  I was there until 1am a couple of nights and someone periodically offered a hot drink.  All the staff based in the  lounge were thoughtful and offered exceptional service. Our room had a good sized desk and a stationary draw with items such as scissors, sticky tape, paper clips - handy.  And free WiFi throughout - a condition of any hotel I…"
July 2013,outstanding,"This is opulent old school style, great room and facilities excellent service so many complimentary items like ice cream in hot weather not cheap but great value. This would be a very difficult place to fault beautiful setting just wonderful."
June 2013,Just about perfect... and there ain't no such thing as perfect!,"A combination of business and pleasure brought my party to London. I booked two rooms. From check-in to check-out the staff was, indeed, perfect. Invariably, on a seven-day stay, situation, requests, issues come up. The staff dealt with every one, solved every problems, secured every dinner reservation, arranged every transport, fulfilled every request with aplomb and courtesy and sincere ""at-your-service"" attitude. Stefan Otto and ALL of the floor staff, from reception to servers to doormen to maids... just unfailing service with a charming smile.  The facility is charming, polished and spotlessly clean... maybe the coolest boutique hotel setting in the West (Upper House in Hong Kong still gets best-boutique-hotel-in-the-world in my book). I loved the small size and warren of…"
July 2013,"Treated like royalty, wonderful service, cool a/c","We stayed three nights at Hotel 41. Upon arrival we were greeted with two glasses of Champagne. We were actually given our choice of preferred Champagne. Service and checkin were flawless. It is hard to describe the ambiance at 41. We enjoyed the executive lounge with snacks, fresh bread, drinks available at all times. The hallways and rooms are very European with low ceilings, many mirrors, wood, nicely decorated. Very quaint. We enjoyed our conversations with Stefan Otto and our bellman Brogdan was very attentive and helpful. All the staff was wonderful. The only flaw of our stay was some problems with the main elevator. Normally this would have been a major issue, but the attentiveness of the staff and the accommodations made up for this big time. It is very easy to miss…"
June 2013,We were made to feel like we were Royalty!,"If you aren’t careful, you may just miss this sweet little Gem of a Boutique Hotel, placed in a superb location ~ right across the street from the Queen’s ‘Mews’ (where Queen Lizzie stores her Royal Coaches, Bentleys, Rolls, and such.) When you drive up to 41 Buckingham Palace Rd, the more prominent façade of the sister ‘Red Carnation’ Hotel, ‘The Rubens’, sits immediately next door to the entrance of ‘Hotel 41’. Hotel 41 actually occupies the 5th floor of what used to be the Rubens Hotel Ball Room, but now holds 30 beautifully appointed rooms of this very special and classically British residence.  When my wife and I arrived at the 41, we were escorted to a stylish elevator lift, which took us to the reception desk located in the Executive Lounge on the 5th floor. We were…"
May 2013,Wonderful stay -- helpful staff,"We are already planning our next stay at Hotel 41.  From the moment we arrived after our overnight flight from the US, the staff was perfect.  From arranging for us to have a ""temporary"" room until our room was cleaned to offering us breakfast (we slept through the United Airline breakfast) -- our first day in London started much better than anticipated.    The team was always willing to make restaurant suggestions (which were great) and helpful hints on things to see.  Our favorite part of the day was heading back ""home"" for tea and biscuits.    We reserved an Executive King, which was bigger than we had expected.  Next time, we plan to upgrade to the suite.  After our stay, Hotel 41 is now in my wife's top 3 hotels in the world."
August 2012,One of the best places to stay!,I've been lucky to stay at Hotel 41 several times and every time has been wonderful. The hotel staff are incredibly service oriented and no ask is too small. The rooms are beautifully decorated. Location is great. Cannot say enough good things about this hotel!
July 2013,Perfectly Classic British,"Unfortunately we were only able to stay at this hotel one night and my husband and I both wished we were able to stay longer.  I really love small personal boutique hotels and 41 is just that - personal in every way.  First the hotel is in a great location - directly across the street from Buckingham Palace.  Upon arrival we were greeted with a lovely glass of champagne - what's better than that!!!  Our room was perfect - black and white decor with British prints on the wall, comfortable king size bed with soft linen, well appointed bathroom, plenty of storage space if you like to unpack - even with drawers in the bathroom, sofa and chair in the room, and the best - a fireplace!!!!  Our room was down the hall from the lounge - decorated like a beautiful sitting room.  Breakfast…"
May 2013,Excellent well recommended fellow reviewers,We stayed at the 41 last night and were not let down by fellow trip advisor reviewers.  It truly is an excellent hotel with friendly staff and flawless service amongst the best we have found anywhere.  From the warm welcome and refreshing champagne to the professional check out we were very impressed.  A slight glitch caused by a fellow guest which was outside the control of the hotel was handeled swifty and the resolution was by far in excess of expectations. Although we were not actually in Buckingham Palace we felt as though we were treated like royalty. We will not be strangers hotel 41 see you soon.
May 2013,A brightly sparkling jewel.,"Hotel 41 will always be our hotel whenever we visit London.The rooms are large & beautifully appointed  ~ just 2 blocks from Victoria Station tube. I am hard pressed to think of any hotel with as over- the -top phenomenal service as this jewel. The staff was amazingly welcoming, helpful, & charming...allowing us to feel at home each & every day by remembering our names, inquiring about our day, asking about our needs, providing wonderful complimentary snacks every afternoon & evening. The staff just couldn't do enough for you...they truly had your interest at heart. The breakfast was great and the setting of the lovely lounge where it was served made you want to stay all day. We would refer to returning to 41 at the end of a busy day as ""going home""."
May 2013,"Everything you could ask for for a ""reasonable"" price","The 41 is a top notch hotel.  I've been fortunate to stay in some wonderful hotels including several Ritz-Carltons, the Ritz Paris and a Sangri-La.  This hotel does not dissapoint in any way.  And, though not cheap, was less expensive than the competition.    The room was large for London and beautifully decorated.  The staff was overwhelmingly helpful, courteous and friendly.  They made us feel important and appreciated.    The breakfast was great.  I didn't have any of the complimentary food in the evening, but my wife did and enjoyed it.  Complimentary bottled water day or night was nice, too.  The location is great. (How could it not be across the street from Buckingham Palace)  It was less than a 5 minute walk to trains or underground at Victoria Station.  I would…"
May 2013,Wonderful Find!,"The 41 far surpasses any expectations I had for a stay in London. Based on the reviews, I expected to have a great stay, but it was still better than I could have imagined. the staff was so very accommodating, they offered us complimentary beverages upon arrival at the front desk, then another offer of complimentary Champaign upon check in. After they personally escorted us to our room, we walked in to find a personal greeting card and handmade candies on the table inside the room. Also on the table was a beautiful white orchid plant (what a nice touch!) The room had a fire place as well, and when we called the front desk to have it turned on the staff was to our room and had it turned on within five minutes of calling. The 'Executive Lounge' is quite nice as well. Complete with…"
May 2013,Fantastic Stay!,"My mother and I stayed at the Hotel 41 on our recent trip to London.  The hotel was beautiful, had a fantastic location near Buckingham Palace, and the room was unbelievable.  Having never been to London before, the staff graciously directed us to amazing attractions and restaurants.  The staff and service they provided definitely made our trip, they were the best ever!"
May 2013,Rare find,"This is an extraordinary property and well executed in all aspects, but by far the chief appeal is the tremendous staff associated with the hotel.  Without exception, this special oasis is populated with A+ team members clearly handpicked with an eye for authentic personal passion for the hospitality trade."
May 2013,Hotel41...where!,"Stayed for a night with my wife as it was near the show we were going to. Taxi driver had no idea where it was which is part of the dark mystery of the hotel according to the concierge. It's stuck between Reuben's 43 and a bar. Entered the building and spent 10 mins waiting with an overly enthusiastic welcome committee, the hotel only has 28 rooms all on the 5th floor, we were escorted to floor 5 with staff falling over themselves to greet us.  Don't get me wrong, the decor is good and if small is what you like then this is the place for you, as there are only 28 rooms, you seem to always have way too many staff asking if all is well and bothering you, on more than one occasion I was in deep conversation with my wife when a body or two just appeared next to us! Standing there…"
March 2013,Service with style,"My Husband & I stayed here for one night whilst in London. Our room was lovely, well equipped, clean and quietly located. Wonderful service experienced during our stay.. Complimentary chocolates and champagne as it was our anniversary as well as going the extra mile with restaurant bookings and just a special kind of service which ft natural not forced as in other establishments. Location fantastic, breakfast divine... All in all wonderful!"
May 2013,impeccable service,"In the shadows of Buckingham Palace, Hotel 41 is a little oasis of charm with outstanding service from the excellent staff. Although a small hotel, the welcome and attention to detail was simply first class. Our family room was well appointed and had many little luxuries, like free bottles of still and sparkling water, chocolates and toffees, and even free tubs of ice cream for the children, which was a massive hit with them! Only yards from both victoria station, the big bus site seeing tour and buckingham palace, it is a fantastic venue to explore central london. We strolled up the Mall to Trafalgar Square, and enjoyed some walks through St James Park and Green Park, which are both minutes from the hotel. The executive lounge was lavishly appointed and the breakfast's were…"
April 2013,Best of the Best!  We Miss Hotel 41!,"There are not enough words to describe how wonderful Hotel 41 is.  We stayed for 7 nights, and would have loved to stay more!  The staff are amazing!  Everyone is extremely friendly, and they are very eager to help make your stay comfortable and memorable.  I really cannot say enough about the friendliness of the staff.  They were always asking where we were going for the day and if there was anything we needed for our day out (there is bottled water, coffee, treats, and umbrellas at the front door of the hotel).  When we returned, they asked all about our day.  We were always greeted with a smile and kind words.  This is truly a genuinely great group of people!      The location is fantastic.  We were able to walk anywhere we wanted to go.  All of the major sights of London are…"
July 2012,First Class all the way!,"I chose this hotel after reading many reviews on TripAdvisor and they were spot on!  We stayed 2 nights here after a cruise before flying home and it was the perfect choice.  Right at check in we were greeted and treated to a beverage of our choice and seated at the desk to receive our room.  When we asked about a restaurant within walking distance they pointed us to the one right next door and the Hotel Manager even called ahead to treat us to a glass of champagne before dinner!    Location was ideal for us, it's directly across the street and one block down to the entrance of Buckingham Palace which we were able to tour due to the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.    Our room was beautiful, we couldn't have been more pleased. We will definitely return!"
February 2013,Hotel 41,"My family (husband and three children) stayed in one of the suites in eary February. The staff were wonderful, very attentive  - couldn't do enough for us . The suite was a bit cramped with the five of us but still fabulous, with a huge, extremely comfy, king size bed and 2 sofa beds which weren't so comfortable.The location was perfect, food was fabulous and the kids enjoyed 'raiding the pantry' most nights. A big thank you to Lauren and her team who made our London experience extremely enjoyable."
March 2013,"Privacy, comfort and style","COnveniently located close to Victoria Station, perfect if you flew in at Gatewick and if you enjoy some early morning jogging around St.James and Buckingham Palace. Beautiful rooms and delicious breakfast in a stilish environment. Excellent staff. Quality has its price, but it is good value for your money."
April 2012,too popular. for good reason!,"my husband and i stayed here almost 2 years ago. we get regular red carnation e mail and thought let's stay again this weekend.  (we are from los angeles, live in paris and travel to england several times a year for various events). this time, we will be attending a concert at the royal opera house and this hotel is close enough, but far enough from the craziness of covent garden to be convenient. but now that the 41 is ranked 1 on trip advisor, it is way too popular for us to book/afford!  (we will let you know where we end up staying  this weekend....  i'm certain it will end up at the top of the list, again...)  the 41 reputation is well deserved.  we have stayed at many 5 star hotels in london but we really liked this exceptional small hotel and wanted to return..."
November 2012,spent last 4 nights of our honeymoon at 41...treated like the royal family!,Had stayed at Rubens at the Palace many years ago but wanted something a little more special for the last 4 days of our honeymoon on our way back to the States from Africa. We were tired from travel and arrived late in the evening. We had to wait a bit in the downstairs lobby but finally made it upstairs to the Executive Lounge where we were warmly welcomed and treated to champagne as we checked in. We were given a full tour of our room which ended up being quite small and had some plumbing issues. They didn't have any other large-size rooms to move us to that evening so allowed us access to a nearby small room for use of the bathroom and then officially switched us to a larger junior-suite type room the following day for the remainder of our stay. They handed the entire move…
February 2013,Best Hotel in London,My new favorite Hotel in London. We used to stay at Claridge's but thought would try something different. We are so pleased that we did. Lauren was amazing and really made us feel very welcome. My only complaint would be that the room was a little on the small side. The Executive Lounge is amazing as was the breakfast. Definitely deserves its number 1 status.
March 2013,A great experience,"We loved it here. The service can be a bit overpowering - staff seem to outnumber guests. The executive lounge is a home from home, and we used it rather than the somewhat pokey room. Good location near Buckingham Palace, and good use of the Rubens Hotel facilities. Definitely recommended, one of the best hotels in London."
March 2013,Outstanding experience!,"Just returned from my stay at Hotel 41, and am wishing I'd stayed longer! I found Hotel 41 on here by accident whilst browsing for a hotel on Park lane, I saw the reviews and couldn't quite believe how highly it was recommended, and at a price similar, if not cheaper than other hotels in the area.   As soon as I arrived I was taken aback by the service, I've never known anything like it! From checking in to showing me to my room the attention to detail was amazing. I had to dash out early on to go to an event at park lane, but when I arrived back I was pleasantly surprised to find a hot water bottle warming my bed accompanied by music and refreshments! The room was of course amazing, I was in a king size suite I believe, and it was immaculate with a huge comfy bed and awesome…"
March 2013,Hotel 41-Fantastic Stay!,"My wife have stayed at 41 before and thouroughly enjoyed it. We stayed on March 2nd 2013 for her 41st birthday( worked well with the Hotel name!)  We have stayed in many many nice 'top end hotels'-Dorchester, 4 seasons etc etc, but Hotel 41 for the experince and service levels is the best we have stayed in.  I cannot speak too highly of Lauren and the entire team who make it their absolute mission to make your stay perfect.   A small and intimate hotel."
March 2012,41 is INCREDIBLE,"Hospitality workers should be required to stay at this gracious hotel before working elsewhere. 41 is 41 Buckingham Palace Road. Yes, THAT Buckingham Palace Road - across the road from the Queen's house. Our room overlooked the Queen's backyard. The service it TOP NOTCH. Wonderful fireplaces. Excellently decorated rooms. If possible, spend a few nights in the Conservatory Master Suite. You will know it is worth every penny when you lie on the bed, hot the remote and the ceiling opens There is nowhere else in London quite like our Conservatory Master Suite. Where else could you sleep in such opulent luxury beneath the twinkling city stars? If you tire of the view, electric blinds turn your split-level suite into a private paradise complete with a HUGE, immaculate marbled bathroom…"
April 2013,If you want to be treated like royalty stay at 41 hotel.,41 hotel was the most amazing experience I have ever encountered on vacation.  The service was superb and the staff were attentive to your needs.  This is the only hotel that I want to stay in.  My friends and I were treated as royalty from the time we stepped foot out of our taxi.  Thanks to all the wonderful staff at 41 hotel.
April 2013,"The quality of service, attention to detail and luxury that EVERY hotel should aspire to!","I won't repeat the well deserved superlatives that Hotel 41 warrants, but our return visit proved that our findings on our first stay were far from a fluke! The staff are just as attentive, charming, genuinely friendly and live to ensure that you enjoy your stay. It's not difficult to revel in the luxuriance of this top quality hotel and nothing is too much trouble for every member of the young and professional staff headed by Lauren. The hotel is ideally situated. We found a lovely gem of a find around the corner from Hotel 41, The Westminster Cathedral, which, apart from being an impressively ornate Victorian Catholic cathedral, has a tower with awesome views across the London skyline in all directions. Save yourself £24 (I understand its £29 at The Shard)  and spend £5 for an…"
March 2013,"Comfort, service and treat at hotel 41","As already described by others, the service in this botique hotel is pleasent and personalized. I noticed a few business people using the facilities as their living room, which of course is nice if the travel iteniary is intensive and you want to get away from the international branded hotels. My wife loved the hotel and room decoration.  After a busy day we were going out for dinner, and decided to have a drink in the library/bar/lounge and ended up staying there in front of the fireplace. We were kindly offered some nice appetizers and this took us further to the free buffet of a high standard. This is a nice treat. It seems to be a mixed clientele, business people, get-away holidayas and turists. The hotel situated next to buckingham palace invites to spend some time in the…"
April 2013,Hotel 41 - why I may never stay anywhere else in London again.,"We stay in London fairly frequently, and usually with children. This was our 48 hour ""escape break"" without children and Hotel 41 ticked all the boxes. For so many reasons it is rated number 1 in London and the rating is 100% accurate.  The welcome at the front desk was very friendly, and you felt expected. Cara was the lovely lady who came to greet us and accompany us upstairs. Check-in was accompanied by a glass of champagne and then we had a seat by the fire before being shown our room. Stylish, large for London, a wonderfully comfortable bed, pillow menu etc...all the small things that make you feel special. As this was a trip to celebrate our wedding anniversary, there were many special gifts from the hotel...a romantic turndown where the room was prepared for our return…"
April 2013,The Absolute 5 Star Hotel *****,"I currently live in Barnard Castle, and had a long trip journey to London and had just a bit of trouble finding the right Five Star Hotel. I found this place and currently inside the Hotel while writing this review.  The hotel experience by the server's are really briliiant and fabulous as they're speedness is skilled and extremely friendly. The sleep qualitiness is brilliant and everything else here is absolutely amazing.  There are no complaints in regards of this Hotel Experience with my family and friends. I don't hesitate to highly recommend this hotel for everyone who are going in a journey to London, this is the right place to stay for the trip.  The hotel is absolutely large and huge (at the same time), enough rooms for everyone. The rooms are very clean, good value for…"
April 2013,Great team,"a great combination of city and boutique hotel. the stuff is amazing and service oriented. rooms are big and comfortable. all the small bits and pieces are high quality and well needed. braekfast is great, room service is very good. location is tourististic oriented, not comfortable for shopping or city meetings, good for West End seekers. TV is small but u have one in the bathroom.  they have a special call button - ANYTHING, ANYTIME"
May 2012,Amazing hotel,"Small rooms, as you'd expect from an London hotel, but this is an amazing hotel none the less. The lounge is very comfortable, the staff are very attentive. I would recommend it but it is expensive. I would stay again"
December 2012,Amazingly Relaxed and Comfortable,"Stayed just before Xmas (sorry bit late catching up), for a pre-xmas break. Breakfast - best in London? Probably. Bed comfortable (stayed in junior suite). They think of everything here that makes you feel the most important person there.  The staff cannot do more for you, they are there just when you need them.  We enjoyed it so much we went back again in March and stayed in the same room. Also the Library Restaurant in the sister hotel next door is superb."
March 2013,Great place to stay,"We spent 3 nights at Hotel 41 (room 4106) and loved it.  We booked the English cooked breakfast option, but could also raid the continental breakfast bar while we waited for our food.  We utilised the ""Raid the Pantry"" service after 8:30pm when we returned from the Lion King show one night, and an evening tour of the Buckingham Palace State Rooms on another.  The location is great and we had an easy, leisurely walk with coffee stops and lunch on our first day passing or visiting the following sights - Royal Mews, Queen's Gallery, Admiralty Arch, Horse Guards Parade, Big Ben, London Eye, Palace of Westminster, 10 Downing Street, Trafalgar Square, Nelson's Column, Admiralty Arch, St James's Park.  A convenience store, restaurants and shops are behind the hotel and major stores are…"
June 2012,"Actually, it is the #1 hotel in London","My husband and I stayed there a year ago and, after reading the last reviewer, I felt the need to post. First of all, I have stayed at many 5 star hotels, all over the world, and Hotel 41 is one of the best. The location is unbelievable..it is right across the street from Buckinham Palace. So, it is not right in front of the ""gates,"" where no hotels are anyway, but, from our room, we could see inside the Palace walls. I remember watching guests arrive for the Queen's Julibee and this all happened right outside our hotel window. Secondly, the staff could not have been more welcoming, professional or knowledgable. Not only did they greet us with a glass of wine (pressed shirts and all), but they helped us out with dinner reservations & show tickets. The hotel is very exclusive,…"
November 2012,Best Hotel in London...........,"I arrived late on a Saturday afternoon. The hotel is situated in a discrete location & I liked that immediately. In the reception room I was greeted by a very attentive staff member tendering to all my needs. I was lead up to the Executive Lounge  for checking in & the customary glass of champagne - perfect start to the evening -   The Executive King Room is clean, spacious & bathroom. What I especially liked was the little touches of when I entered the room, there was a greetings card & chocolates their to greet me.  I was more than happy with the professional staff as they made my experience of Hotel 41, a time to remember.  I look forward to my return to your hotel in 2013"
November 2012,4 Days at the 41 in London,"Hotel 41 is a a quaint hotel with impeccable service and attention to detail. The staff are incredibly friendly, helpful, and professional. Turn down service included chocolates, classical music, and the fireplace on. My only issue was the lack of space in the sleeping area. We were in a junior suite on 2 floors and the desk was right beside the bed. Not only did this make the bedroom area difficult to walk around in, but trying to work while my wife was sleeping was not possible. Certainly not a complaint-but my suggestion would be to move the desk downstairs to the sitting area which would provide more room in the bedroom and would also allow guests to  utilize the downstairs sitting room more. Overall though we were thrilled with our time at the 41 and would highly recommend…"
November 2012,Hidden luxury,"A discrete entrance near Buckingham Palace Road and Victoria St. welcomes you to an exquisite boutique hotel that without a doubt it will be my #1 place of choice from here on out. The room was well designed, the bed was uber comfortable, the room amenities were top-notch and the location convenient to business areas and tourist sites. The availability of complimentary breakfast and snacks in the executive lounge was a welcomed convenience to a weary traveler with days full of business meetings, and the quality of the food was superb. The hotel was quiet, warm, beautiful and welcoming.  Beyond all that, however, the single best part about this lovely hotel was the staff.  Without exception, each was incredibly kind and completely focused on customer satisfaction. You could tell…"
October 2012,Relaxing weekend in fabulous surroundings,"A wonderful stay in this luxurious hotel where nothing is too much trouble. It is well placed being near Buckingham Palace and in easy reach of other interesting places to visit. The resident manager Lauran Hargrave and her team gave us a friendly welcome on arriving in the executive lounge.  Every detail was thought of during our stay, the staff are knowledgeable and showed interest in our activities while in London. The chocolate cake to celebrate my birthday was a very much appreciated example of the effort made to provide a happy weekend for us. The weekend was topped off with a wonderful Champagne tea in the lounge, the pastry chef excelled as usual. Really enjoyable relaxing weekend, a great experience once again and looking forward to returning."
November 2012,Fabulous weekend break..special Birthday,"Myself and my wife have just spent a long weekend at this excellent hotel. The location, decor, comfort and A1 service is by far the best we have received in a long time, in this beautiful city. The staff could not do enough for us. From the minute we arrived we were look after in an Excellent, friendly, and caring way. Top team service from all team members. Thanks for such a great experience and looking forward to visiting again in the new year.  Jeff and Tracy"
November 2012,Possibly the best hotel in England...,"My wonderful new wife and I stayed at Hotel 41 very recently to have a celebratory weekend in London. Having stayed at 41 a number of times previously, the bench had been set in terms of standards/service etc. and it's the true mark of a great hotel that can consistently deliver on this: Hotel 41 does this, without exception.  The staff were exceptional (for example, my wife was unfortunately ill on the Friday night, meaning we had to cancel our dinner reservations at a 'quite hard to book' restaurant. We ended up staying another night at 41 as it really is that good, and the wonderful resident manager Lauren managed to get us a reservation at the same restaurant for Saturday night....no mean feat by any stretch!) There's an unwritten motto at 41 which is unfortunately becoming…"
November 2012,For the Royal Treatment in London stay at Hotel 41!,"We just spent a week in London, staying at the Hotel 41.  From the first contact at arrival to the amenities in our suite and executive lounge, everything was top notch.  The very personal service from all of the staff made us feel truly welcome.  We were always greeted by our name.  We loved relaxing in the executive lounge with our cappuccinos in the morning and pink champagne in the evening.The location enabled us to walk to many attractions and restaurants, which were well recommended by the staff.  It was always nice to come back to our room after dinner to find our bed turned down, the fireplace lit, the sterio quietly playing classical music, candles lit in the bathroom  ... it was all of the little touches that made our experience so great!  We look forward to going back!"
November 2012,Amazing hotel in the heart of London!,"What an amazing hotel. As the other reviews state, the service is unbeatable.  My husband and I stayed here for three nights and weren't ready to leave when we did.  Check In - Complimentary champagne with arrival along with a great overview of the hotel and amenities.  The staff also checks in to see if they can help with any travel planning while you are there. My husband plans everything so we didn't need much help but they helped with transportation and gave a thumbs up to his choices.  Room - We stayed in a junior suite that comprised of two levels.  The lower level was small but comfortable and had a lovely fireplace.  The upstairs had a desk, closet, bedroom and bath.  It wasn't large but was very comfortable.  Attention to detail has been paid to the rooms.  Anything you…"
November 2012,An Hotel yes! But with all the comforts of an English Country Home,"From first contact, through booking, to arrival, attention to detail was exceptional, even to describing where to pull up the car, ""we'll unload sir and park the car for you, congestion charge paid sir?"" (I had done something!). Arrived slightly early, ""please take a seat sir, madam - champagne?"" Very pleasant!  We were courteously shown to our room, the door opened, my wife immediately burst into tears for I had requested the ""Romantically"" package, (see it to believe it.)  A quick change prior to the concierge booked car arriving exact to time, concert and return to a beautifully appointed Lounge offering complimentary self service buffet with a ""honesty tab"" for drinks plus staff on hand offering assistance.  We've all stayed in Hotels where the room phone has 101 extension…"
November 2012,Unsurpassed excellence,"Wow, what a wonderful hotel. Great location, fabulous design and flawless execution.   Location - turn right out of the front door and you are at the gates of Buckingham Palace within 3 minutes. Turn left, across 2 blocks into Victoria St and you have an 8 minute walk to Westminster.   Design - enter the narrow foyer, head for the lift and ascend to Level 5. The hotel takes up the entire top floor with the suites centred around the wonderfully warm and welcoming guest lounge. The top floor location allows for natural light to make its way into the lounge and guest suites via skylights. The black and white decor, against a backdrop of rich, red timbers and antique furnishings, works wonderfully - classy without being over the top.   Execution - 41's stated philosophy is ""no…"
October 2012,Amazing Quality & Service,"I booked this hotel based on the reviews here, and as a surprise for my wife for our 20th wedding anniversary. What can I say other than the hotel and every member of staff were fantastic. Having stayed at many other five star hotels, this was a real eye opener as to what quality and service is all about. The hotel provided a complimentary bottle of Champagne on arrival, and also a romantic turn-down service (Rose petals, candles and a congratulations cake with another bottle of Champagne) when we returned from our meal in London. I booked the hotel only four days before arrival and was lucky to get a room considering it was a Saturday night, I also wanted to get tickets for a West End show, being a typical man and leaving this right til the last minute all tickets were sold out…"
October 2012,Magnificent Hotel 41 - a real gem in London!,"We have just had three nights at Hotel 41 in an Executive King Room, to celebrate my 60th and our 35th Wedding Anniversary and to see our daughter who lives in London. From the moment we walked into the hotel we knew our stay was going to be special. We loved the black and white decor and the ambience in the Executive Lounge - very calming.  Our daughter was meeting us at 41 after we arrived from Paris - Monika made her feel welcome to await our arrival.  What a wonderful way to celebrate - champagne on arrival and such a warm and inviting atmosphere.  The staff allowed us to catch up with our daughter whilst enjoying the champagne and just sit and enjoy the lounge area - fire going - wonderful!  Special thanks to all the staff at 41 - everyone is so attentive and friendly and…"
September 2012,a truly individual 5* hotel - highly recommend,"I booked a basic room for one night during London Design Week for my daughter and myself. If this was basic goodness knows what the superior rooms were like. From the minute we made the reservation to the time that we left the staff could not do enough to make our stay comfortable and memorable. Our room was on 2 levels with a couch, flat screen tv, small table with 2 chairs, and a living flame gas fire downstairs; upstairs was a superking bed, another flat screen tv, ipod dock, bathroom. All the window blinds were electronically controlled. I believe that there are just under 40 bedrooms in the hotel and it is situated on the top floor of its sister hotel, The Ruebens, in what used to be the ballroom. The reception area is like a country house library, with reading nooks, a…"
September 2012,I wish I was still there...,"My husband and I stayed at 41 during our first trip to London. We booked the hotel, based on the reviews read on this website, so I thought it was only fair that I was just as helpful to any other potential guests.   We are the parents of 3 children, and we decided to take a “second honeymoon”.  We booked a basic room with breakfast included...but we got SO much more!! Our flight got into London at 7am and we arrived at the hotel around 8 am, only expecting to be able to store our bags..but the saints that they are, had our room ready for us. We were able to freshen up, and they were even able to get us last minute tickets to the Tower of London. The people working there gave us excellent recommendations on how to spend our day. We entered our room, and a bottle of champagne on…"
September 2012,Pampered excellence,"Treated like royals (unlike the taxi driver who suggested we wouldn't be staying there as it was too expensive for us). Extremely helpful staff, fantastic room, really flexible with check in /out and luggage storage, all the nice little touches, great lounge area for true relaxation. The full package!! Definitely stay again."
October 2012,unbelievable,"This hotel is just perfect. I can't believe all the attention I have received during this stay. My business tripwas more a leisure treat at the end. Car transfer organised last minutes, fax and e-mail dealt by the team, last minute meeting in their boardroom for free. My colleagues all enjoyed the lounge and the boardroom for lunch. It has been such a great experience. I'm looking forward to return.  The icing on the cake was the young manager in charge of this hotel (Frederic, don't be shy to call him Freddie). He was second to none and I watched him going from one table to an other, chatting with guests, paying a lot of attention to them that I couldbn't believe where he could take his energy from.   I stayed 5 days and I have seen him everyday. Morning, Afternoon, dinner and…"
March 2012,I recommend this hotel to everyone,"I have stayed at 41 only twice and each time the service, friendliness and the atmosphere were terrific.  I particularly liked after flying in from the States, they allowed me into my room so early in the day.  You will enjoy your stay here even though the taxi driver may quiz you a bit more as to where you're going.  "
October 2012,Best B&B in London,"From the moment we arrived at the airport, the limousine picked us up and dropped us at the door steps of the hotel.  You almost could miss the door, if not paying attention.  The doorman let us in and we were greeted with a glass of champagne.  The room, with a bathtub, shower and fireplace was plush and the king-size bed and bedding was perfectly comfortable.  The concierge helped us book reservations at great restaurants and shows.  We met some wonderful people - other guests.  The meals were delicious and the wine superb.  We will not go anywhere else in London and will definitely go back."
September 2012,if the neighborhood is good enough for the Queen...,"Fantastic location, just a couple of blocks from Victoria station and a couple of blocks from Buckingham Palace.  The service was exceptional- possibly the best service we have ever encountered. Our room was very small,  but it was well appointed.  Trip Advisor did us well.  We will return."
October 2012,Won't stay at another London Hotel,"We've stayed at several other high end hotels including the Ritz and Connaught and for us, 41 outranks them all.  Quiet, warm, and a wonderful friendly staff.  They go out of their way to give the best service possible and they quickly learn and use your name.  I'm a fairly picky person regarding hotel cleanliness and this is the only hotel I've stayed at that sanitizes their tv and radio remote controls."
October 2012,"A Good Stay, Not a Perfect One.","We recently stayed 2 nights at 41.  It is located on the 5th floor of the Rubens at the Palace hotel.  We had stayed in the Rubens several times during trips to London and decided to give 41 a go this trip.  We were greeted by the friendly staff on arrival and eventhough we arrived early in the morning we were able to get into our room after just a short wait.  While waiting we were offered a drink of our choice which was a nice touch.  The room was nice and roomy by London standards.  The overall decor is black and white, we had a small window that looked out on an office building and the construction below. We did recieve yummy treats in our room after turndown service but the pillow menu eluded us, which is not that big of a deal.  There were some concerns overall with the…"
September 2012,Wonderful honeymoon stay!,What a wonderful boutique hotel.  Staff was amazing.  Very knowledgeable and eager to please their quests.  No request was too small or too large for them to handle.  Rooms are a bit small but very comfortable and clean.  The lounge is lovely to just sit by the fire and have a drink or read a book. Look forward to staying here again.
October 2012,Another Wonderful Stay,"This was our second stay at the 41 (the first was in December 2011).  The 41 is a wonderful, comfortable, cozy place to stay.  The rooms have an air of understated elegance, with every amenity that  you would need for your stay, including umbrellas, business supplies, a pillow menu (!), access to exercise equipment, and a tasty treat in your room upon arrival.    We were welcomed with a glass of champagne by Freddie, the Resident Manager of the hotel.  He is a genuinely caring person, who remembers past guests and makes sure that every guest feels at home...he and Monika ( the assistant manager, and equally kind) make you feel that you are part of the family, as does the rest of the staff of the hotel.  We recognized many employees from our last trip and they remembered us,…"
October 2012,Fabulous Hotel and Staff,"We thoroughly enjoyed our beautiful, artistic room and the delicious breakfasts and late evening snacks in the lounge.  The hotel staff felt like a cross between family and personal attendants, and we can't say enough about the conviviality and professionalism of the staff. The location was convenient for us, but we would go out of our way to return to this marvelous hotel.  It was perfect in every way."
October 2012,Love this hotel,Staying at 41 always makes me think that this is what it must be like living in that big house just around the corner.  Service is amazing - friendly without being creepy - and you always meet the most interesting people in the executive lounge.  I've stayed there 3 times in the past year and can't wait until I can stay there again.
October 2012,"Lovely central hotel, amazing service","We just stayed 4 nights in the executive king room....which was lovely. I would not get a smaller room .... this was good for the 4 nights we had. The hotel is charming, but made even more so by the staff.  I would describe this as a boutique hotel with personalised service. Staff know your name, and are only very happy to assist. Breakfast both cooked and continental is amazing, best I have ever had....a perfect way to start the day.  The continental offered great options and excellent muesli...which may not seem exciting but it is often hard to find....strawberries, blueberries, all fresh.  There is the executive lounge which is an added bonus...you can call by for cheese or sweets, there is also a full bar, which operates by honesty box. There is a fireplace to sit next to to…"
October 2012,Superb all the way,"Me and my better half stayed at the Hotel 41 for 3nights. And it was superb from beginning till the end. The staff was fantastic from the day we booked the hotel and they contacted us in the days before arrival to be sure that everything was in order. They had superb controll of everything. The transfer from and to Heathrow was as we asked for, we could ask for whatever we wanted and they could fix it ( and they was very quick to fix it), the rooms was exellent and had everything, and the area the hotel are placed is very good with only a short nice walk away from Buckingham and the shopping areas. All in all we have found the hotel we will stay in every time we are visiting London."
January 2012,This place is amazing!!!!!!!!,"As an avid international traveler amongst the Sofitel's, Ritz Carlton's and Four Season's this experience was exceptional.  The service was spot-on and the staff was tremendous.  I would be heartbroken to stay at any other property in London. The staff was gracious and proactive--nigh telepathic--in anticipating our needs: from laundry (pricey; you should know that up front. But crucial, given our situation) to fresh towels, to extraordinary flexibility regarding maid service (I was sleeping in at ridiculous, unpredictable hours!) to cough drops and tea and extra blankets and a thousand other small but much-appreciated kindnesses.  This place is amazing!!!!!!!! had an amazing time there, highly recommend."
September 2012,Exceeded high expectations!,"My wife and I recently took our first trip to London. We were thoroughly impressed with our Hotel 41 experience. The great location was within walking distance of so many must-see sights. The spotless room was by far the most stylish we'd ever seen, and it was loaded with innumerable amenities (e.g., fireplace, heated towel rack, office supplies, etc). Perhaps the most notable feature was the unparalleled level of service. From the charming personnel in the lobby to the attentive servers in the Executive Lounge to the accommodating assistant manager (Monika), all went far above and beyond. There is no question in our minds that when we eventually return for our second visit to London that we will be well-cared for in the tucked-away secret at 41 Buckingham Palace Road! Highly…"
October 2012,A Special Place,"We are Londoners and wanted a special night away together - and 41 delivered all we could have hoped for.  Lovely people, special ambiance, and a sense of being made special - all the time.  We have no hesitation in recommending 41 - we enjoyed our stay there more than perhaps any other hotel."
October 2012,Pampered like The Queen,"We recently visited London, 2 days on the beginning of our trip going to Croatia and Italy. We stayed at the next door Hotel Rubens, which was quite lovely comfortable and very well located.  Because we loved Rubens, while there we tried to rebook for our return trip, they were totally booked; however a lovely lady there suggested their ""sister hotel, 41,"" which has a separate entrance and elevator to ""the fifth floor"" and a very different world. Welcomed with sparkling wine, invited for snakes which were a meal, treated to a lovely lite breakfast and night caps.  Beds turned down, heated towel racks, bottled water to your hearts desire and much more.  The staff was the most ""can do people"" ever!  They can get you tickets to anything and are so wonderful at making you feel…"
July 2012,PERFECTION!,"Not a fault. Worth every penny and more. Perfect for sight seeing without travelling far. Sooooo luxurious, rooms are beautiful and staff are very helpful. Will visit again with family or with friends."
September 2012,Location Location Location - plus great service,"If you are visiting London for romance, pleasure and site seeing, you can't go past Hotel 41. Situated right where all the action is, near Victoria Station and Buckingham Palace, I was transported to a wonder world - this was my first visit to London. My wife and I were looked after with great care. Highly recommended, the hotel won't dissappoint."
September 2012,Charming and lovely hotel,We spent only 2 days in this charming hotel as we were passing through London.  The facilities are cozy and well thought out with a lovely dining/social area.  The hotel has only 20 or so rooms.  Our room was somewhat small but the standard of the facilities and the in-room chimney made up for it!  Location is outstanding being rot next to Buckingham Palace and walking distance from Hyde Park and Oxford Street.  Highly recommend this hotel!
September 2012,expensive but very good,this place is located in very attreactive place with all amenities nearby especially near the tube station. its expensive but you pay for what you get. great staffs. rooms are clean and tidy. would come again on our next anniversary.
September 2012,"Love, love, LOVE the Hotel 41","My experience at the Hotel 41 is unsurpassed by any property I’ve visited before (and I get to travel a lot!).  Particularly, Monika was an absolute jewel and a new friend.  I was celebrating my birthday while in London and Monika arranged for all of my dinners based on her exquisite taste.  I travel alone, but on this trip I was never alone…thanks to Monika, Magda, William, the two lovely ladies who greeted me every time I returned to the hotel and the wait staff in the Executive Lounge.  I appreciated all of the little touches:  little birthday cake, the birthday rose, the turndown service with the “Sleep” spray, the canapés, the olives, the slippers, the bottled water that was handed to me as I left the hotel.  All of it made this birthday the best one in recent memory.  I…"
August 2012,Good Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night. Whilst the the quality of the service is excellent, I found it extremely odd that this hotel did not have a designated check-in/check-out area which was done at the time in the executive lounge.   We stayed at other Red Carnations Hotels, and I don't think that Hotel 41 is in any way better than the Chesterfield Hotel or the Montague on the Gardens.   A lot has been said in the reviews of Hotel 41 about the quality of the service and the excellent staff. I agree that the service is excellent and the staff helpful, however, I found the whole experience a little bit overbearing. It seemed that the staff wanted to have a long conversation every time they poured a new glass of wine. I, for one, prefer that wonderful British…"
June 2012,"Loved, Loved,Loved it!!!","Stayed at the beautiful Hotel 41 for two nights. Arrived from Boston into Heathrow at about 6:30 AM. Decided to run over to the hotel to drop our bags, never expecting a room to be ready at that time. They not only had our room ready for a 7:30 AM check in but everyone was so nice, friendly and helpful and the room was quiet and lovely. The location of the hotel is within walking distance to many tourist attractions and very close to two tube stations.  I can not wait to get back to beautiful London and Hotel 41!"
August 2012,Amazing!,"Oh my God, this place is the best hotel I've ever stayed at! The rooms are spacious, spotless and nicely decorated! All the staff was just amazing, everyone was friendly and helpful. I will definitely stay there again, thank you 41!"
September 2012,"Great hotel, excellent staff","Staying there now as I write this review from the Executive Lounge - relaxing and having a drink. This hotel is excellent - surpassed only by the staff who are personable, friendly, and very helpful (what more can you ask...).  Hands-down, my favorite hotel in London. "
September 2012,"Yes, this hotel deserves its #1 spot on best hotels in London","It exceeded my expectations, and that is after having read the glowing reviews on Tripadvisor.  Truly wonderful service and you feel pampered. We stayed for 3 nights in September and did the Best of British package. the tea master class was such a fun experience.  They just have all the right touches to make you feel pampered. Worth the price. Central location was great - we walked to most of the sights and places we visited. I could go on and on but I don't want to be redundant from past reviews. You won't be disappointed."
September 2012,FANTASTIC!!!   Nicest Hotel we've ever stayed in!,"It was our first trip to London and I used Tripadvisor for the planning.  Hotel 41 is everything everyone said and MORE!  From the minute we arrived to the minute we left they made us feel special.  We were directly across from the Royal Mews and they made us feel like royalty!  Our room was gorgeous and spotless!  The bed was incredibly comfortable and the pillow menu was so impressive!  Our bathroom was fantastic - 2 Showers!!  We were greeted with a large bowl of strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and raspberries shortly after arrival!  I mentioned that I was gluten free and they actually made 2 separate trays for our tea!  They provided gluten free toast at breakfast - we had egg white omelets every morning which were delicious!  They had a well stocked fridge with…"
August 2012,Unadulterated luxury and the best staff in the world,I could go on all day and night but this is quite simply one of the best hotels you will ever visit in your life. World class service and the most charming staff I have ever met. An amazing experience.
July 2012,excellent staff let down by a very average hotel!!,"This hotel is so over-rated!!  My lady friend and I stayed here for two nights in when we went to go see Madonna at Hyde Park in July of this year.  Briefly, because I do not really like to write bad reviews, I will list the faults of the hotel: breakfast is minimal (a member of staff tried to make me pay extra for porridge!!); you cannot watch the television in your bedroom from your bed; the toilet flushing system in our room broke; the sink plug did not work; the ipod docking station was not user-friendly; the bedroom was barely 4* standard.  This hotel relies heavily on the excellent service provided by the dedicated executive lounge team!!  I repeat, the quality of service is absolutely first class; whereas the hotel itself is 4* at best!!"
August 2012,Beyond Expectations,"LOVE Hotel 41!!  My husband and I cannot say enough positive things about this hotel. We stayed there for 5 nights at the end of August and were so impressed with the amazing service, executive lounge, and great location.  For the price, the inclusion of the executive lounge is a huge bonus; they always have a little something to snack on, complimentary water, and a self-serve, honor system bar.  Just steps from Buckingham Palace and a couple miles from Victoria Station, you can cut through the park and walk over to the shops at Bond Street and other sites of interest.  The staff were amazing! So friendly, always there to help with directions, recommendations, and any little need you may have. For example, I needed a quick manicure before my dinner and I told them I wanted to…"
September 2012,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed just one night at 41 for a wedding anniversary and are now saving for a return visit. We could not fault the hotel, we shared afternoon tea with our daughter and son in law and whilst we were enjoying the tea, easily comparable to The Ritz, the staff were busy turning our already luxurious room into a romantic haven! Our daughter requested the package on the day and at no notice at all the staff added rose petals, flowers, candles, champagne etc, including a personally decorated chocolate confection! It looked magical on our return but the nicest thing was that all the staff knew of our surprise and shared in our enjoyment.Customer service and attention to detail was the best we have ever encountered and because the hotel is small it had such a lovely homely feel.…"
May 2012,Still the best hotel in London,"This hotel simply is our dream hotel in London, we only stay in Boutique hotels and this is arguably one of the best in the world. The rooms are stunning the service impecable. I cant wait to stay again which will be by the end of the year.  We had a problem with our restaurant booking at the Ivy and the hotel arranged a table in the Library restaurant next door, which was lovely everything I could ask for."
September 2012,Like being at home...,"We stayed for three delightful nights and am already looking forward to going back. The ambiance, the staff, the rooms - all superb/top of class. We were originally planning on staying in the Corinthia (which is also a delightful hotel in a great location), but I'm really glad we stayed at the 41. Due to its offering (particularly the size and ""homely"" feel) it is a really unique proposition in London. I really haven't come across anything similar before and will now not be looking to stay anywhere else when in town."
October 2011,"London ""Royal"" Hotel","WOW!!  I truly feel - we know how ""royalty"" is treated in London....for from the minute we walked into this lovely hotel- we all were treated as if we were the only people in the hotel.  The hotel is just beautiful, the rooms and suites are very well done and extremely comfortable - but it is the thoughtful, creative and personable things they do for each guest that makes it such an AMAZING hotel.  It is defintely a hidden gem - and selfishly I hope it will always be that way!! We defintely are planning a return trip to Hotel 41 - soon!!  Enjoy!!!"
August 2012,A Truly Extraordinary Experience,"It is so difficult to express how extraordinary our experience was with Hotel 41 without it sounding hyperbolic, but it is, quite simply, the most incredible hotel at which we have ever had the pleasure to stay.  It is not just a coincidence that the hotel is located just down the street from Buckingham Palace, as you are truly treated as royalty when you are there.  The room  was beyond beautiful, ultra plush and comfortable, pristinely clean and roomy.  The food and drink in the Executive Lounge were five star, but it is the service that makes this property 'sui generis', truly in a category by itself.    Frederic, the manager, has a 'team' working for him that could not have been more attentive, friendly or efficient. Our every single need and desire was met by the staff,…"
September 2012,"I want it to remain our secret, but it's just too good to keep quiet!","Based on the Trip Advisor scores, which made it the favourite London hotel of reviewers, we recently spent two wonderful nights in this oasis of calm and sophistication ideally positioned at the rear of Buckingham Palace. I don't want to spoil it for future clients by disclosing some of the thoughtful and unique touches that ""41"" do for their guests, but suffice to say, you will love them all. 41 is a relatively small and intimate hotel, and you are ""buzzed in"" as you would be when seeking to enter a high end jewellers and you are met everytime, by a genuinely friendly member of the reception staff who often knows you by name, and enquires how your day has been. The actual reception and check in desk , and all of the rooms are located on the top floor of the building which is…"
September 2012,Wonderful!,My husband and I stayed for one night to celebrate my birthday. Simply the best hotel we have stayed in managing to combine thoughtful luxury and cosiness. Wish we could have stayed longer and hope to return at some stage. Would thoroughly recommend for a special treat as not cheap.
August 2012,I want to live here!!!!,"I don't think I could ever do 41 justice in words.  From the moment we walked thru the door, we felt that we were the only ones that mattered in the hotel.  The staff  was incredible.  The rooms decorated beautifully.  The special touches that the hotel provided were a welcome surprise.  My husband and I have traveled a great deal, all over the world, and I still can say that 41 is my   favorite hotel.  We will be planning our next vacation in an area where we are able to stay at a Red Carnation hotel.    I wish our stay in London was at the end of our trip.  The experience spoiled us for the est of our trip."
September 2012,Bed and breakfast like charm,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for our anniversary. It was such a wonderful experience with the most personal service. The staff was so personable and friendly. Our room was near the Executive Lounge which gave us the feeling of a bed and breakfast.    Each night we went into the lounge and grabbed some complementary treats for a midnight snack.  Every evening the hotel stocks free ice cream, chips, chocolates, meats and cheeses for their guests. We were always welcomed with friendly faces and personal greetings, and the staff was more than happy to accomodate every request.  We have stayed at many fine hotels but we feel this was our favorite one because it was not only beautiful but catered exceptionally to any and all of our needs."
September 2012,5 Star Quality with a personnel touch,Quality hotel for a special occasion or simply to treat your self while on business. The experience starts with a glass of champagne on arrival in the executive lounge. Staff are very attentive and friendly. Surroundings and atmosphere are stylish. Breakfast in the executive lounge is not to be missed. Rooms are styled on a black and white theme and are very well appointed. Would recommend for the discerning traveller. 
March 2012,Best Anniversary Experience!,"My husband and I stayed for two nights in March 2012. Best choice ever to celebrate our 25th anniversary! Only wished we could have stayed longer. Awesome from the moment you step in, you know you have walked into a magical place. Impecabble on every aspect. Complimentary champagne on arrival and the rest does not disappoint. The staff is what really makes this place special, they all deserve a pay raise!  Location is excellent, breakfast is delicious. You almost hate to leave in the morning, you feel so comfortable in your hotel. Do not miss the tea service under any circumstance! We are still talking about it months later!  Five stars all the way!!!  Thank you Hotel 41!"
August 2012,First Class,"We recently had the pleasure of a 3 night stay at Hotel 41 to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary and it was just perfect.  From the minute we arrived until we sadly departed we were made to feel special and nothing was too much trouble.  All of the staff we encountered were cheerful, friendly, and attentive, without being over bearing.    On the night of our anniversary we returned to a rosepetal covered room complete with candles and bubbles, a really lovely touch and very much appreciated!  We had also received a lovely little anniversary cake with our breakfast that morning which sadly I never got around to eating as was so full from the amazing cooked breakfast!!  If you want to stay in a big busy hotel in London there are probably thousands to choose from, if you want 5…"
June 2012,What an amazing hotel,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for 3 nights in late June/early July this year.  We loved everything about it - our room, the hotel location, and most of all the wonderful staff.  We travel quite a bit, for both business and personal trips, and this was one of our top hotel experiences ever.  From the time we checked in through the time we had to leave to go home, all of the staff was so friendly, helpful and professional.  They always went above and beyond. We will definitely go back."
August 2012,Simply amazing!,"Great service, great location, great staff! Champagne on arrival and a complimentary buffet in the welcoming lounge. All the Staff are helpful, polite and friendly. The atmosphere is relaxed yet luxurious and the breakfasts are to die for. Cannot recommend highly enough. "
December 2011,"Quirky Rooms, Awesome Service","My husband and I spent Christmas in London, and given the number of places closed during that week (the wisdom of our trip timing was debatable), we spent a lot of time at the Hotel 41. The staff could not have been kinder or more accommodating. We loved our Deco-inspired room, and its small size didn't bother us because we had access to the cozy common area with all of its lovely teas, cocktails and snacks. One caveat -- we would not recommend the adjacent restaurant (within a sister property next door to the 41), where we had Christmas Eve and Christmas meals. To be fair ... perhaps the food is fine at other times (non-holidays)."
June 2012,"Well done, 41!","My partner and I enjoy staying in luxury hotels when we travel. To us, the hotel is half the fun of our vacation. So I did A LOT of research before our trip to London. As usual, I looked at all of the large luxury hotels in the area like the Dorchester, the Four Seasons and Claridge’s which were all enticing but then I started reading all of the reviews on Trip Advisor, raving about the 41. I was skeptical about it living up to all the hype but boy did it!   We stayed five nights at the 41 hotel in May, 2012. We loved every minute of it from the time we checked in to the time we checked out and here’s why… Everyone at the 41 seems to truly enjoy their jobs and I mean everyone! The moment we walked into the small lobby we were greeted happily by the receptionist and led upstairs…"
May 2012,Well good!,"My wife and I returned here and this time we stayed in a Junior Suite which was wonderful. Frederique the Manager and Monika the Assistant Manager made our return stay very very comfortable indeed and we loved every minute. This hotel offers such a wonderful experience so different to any other offer available in London and is a really great  place to stay. We had afternoon tea there this time which was very nice indeed and enjoyed the canapes in the early evening, as did our son's who joined us early evening. Location is wonderful and the service offered by all the staff is really first class. Hope to return again for another special occasion."
April 2012,Excellence Personified...with one exception.,"Monica, Remus and Stephan a huge hug and thank-you for the excellent experience!  As an avid international traveler amongst the Sofitel's, Ritz Carlton's and Four Season's this experience was exceptional.  The service was spot-on and the staff was tremendous.  I would be heartbroken to stay at any other property in London.  As every room is different Monica ensured that ""pickier"" tastes were satisfied and proceeded to show me three different rooms that varied in size and views of the city.  We found the perfect room and appreciated the soap menu and pillow menus' which were promptly delivered after ordering.  Although expensive, breakfast was phenomenal.  No comparison and almost worth the 25 pound admission.  Although the bar is well stocked I have a serious problem with Hotel…"
June 2012,Great hotel,"Stayed here few nights with some of my friends and had lovely experience. Very good hotel, clean and tidy cosy rooms,spacious bathrooms, excellent service and helpful staff. The rooms are of a decent size and very well cleaned, sheets were cleaned and towels were changed daily. Highly recommended!"
June 2012,One word...Fabulous!,"By far, Hotel 41 is our favorite hotel EVER! The service is impeccable and the property (location, amenities and rooms) is amazing. We were treated like royalty. The staff could not do enough for us and treated us like we were the only guests in the hotel. Penhaligon's toiletries (my personal favorite) were a nice touch. This hotel is simply top notch luxury!!! We will most definitely be bck soon!"
March 2012,Incredible service,"Can't recommend it highly enough. Nothing is too much trouble, the staff to guest ratio is very high, the Executive Room is a beautiful, lounge, particularly in the winter, with the log fire going, The pantry bar is great, scones and clotted cream all afternoon, penhaligons toiletries and bottles and bottles of it. We stayed in a split level junior suite - great feeling of space, but a bit inconvenient to have to keep walking up and down the stairs to fetch water etc. Probably would not pay the extra next time for the suite, but would stay in  standard double instead. It was very very noisy from the traffic outside, central London location notwitstanding. The bathroom was beautifully finished and the quality of the bed linen superbe. Glass of champagne of arrival, never a…"
July 2012,Amazing service,"The rooms are nice but the best part of this hotel is the service! Every time you go into the executive lounge they are extremely helpful and willing to help in any way they can. We had planned our restaurants beforehand, but if you are not a pre-planner they will be very helpful. The food and drinks in the lounge are also great, an amazing breakfast as well!"
July 2012,A really wonderful experience,"We loved our stay at Hotel 41. Although we were exhausted after our long flight from Australia, we could not resist when they said that it was their tradition to serve Champagne on arrival in their lounge. Even my husband who stays regularly at beautiful hotels loved the intimacy and club-like feel. Breakfast was lovely with a la carte hot food rather than hours old buffet. We loved the plunder the pantry idea, but unfortunately were too busy in London to sit around relaxing in the serene lounge fully enjoying it. The staff were young and fantastic and it was an excellent location."
July 2012,"Excellent service, charming room, great food.","Can't wait to visit here again.. this is my new favorite hotel in London. It's definitely boutique so if you are looking for a big hotel this isn't the place.... but the service is perfect and I love raiding the pantry... the bread basket, cheeses, meats, ice cream...you don't need to go out to dinner!  Location can't be beat either, especially for walking through the parks, Sloane Square, Belgravia and West End."
July 2012,"high expectations, effortlessly surpassed","My wife and I kicked off our honeymoon at Hotel 41 in May this year, and we were looking for something a little bit special given the circumstances.  Having looked at the website, my expectations were set pretty high, and from the second we entered Hotel 41 they were surpassed, and by some way too.   I stay in hotels regularly on business, and have enjoyed some of the UK's well-renowned hotels, but Hotel 41 is in an entirely different league. From the exquisite attention to detail, to the unrivalled levels of personal service, to the quiet, cocooned atmosphere the whole place exudes, this is by far the best hotel I've ever experienced and we will definitely be back. The staff, from the manager, to the chef, to the front of house team could not do enough to make us feel like we…"
May 2012,Second Review,"We were only meant to stay here once on a return trip to London shortly having moved abroad, from London. I think we have stayed here eight or nine times now in a little under three years and I still keep trying to find reasons why we have to go to London. 'What do you mean they are changing the guard again? Best go back then and stay at the 41'.   Wonderful staff. The rooms seem to get better. My best bit? Every time you go there are examples of changes, ever so slight, but nonetheless changes that have been subtly suggested by guests and the hotel staff have listened. Amazing.    My only downside is, being a frequent visitor, the menu doesn't change. I would love to see a revitalised menu. I thank you."
June 2012,Exceptional,"Hotel 41 is truly an exceptional hotel.  It exudes character and charm in a wonderful area of London.  The true masterpiece of the hotel however, is the staff.  My wife and I stayed for 4 nights and could not have been more impressed by every member of the staff.  Whether you are traveling with children, traveling casually, or traveling formally you will be treated as another reviewer noted ""like royalty"".  Would highly recommend this exceptional hotel.  EMD"
June 2012,Fantastic hotel,"Beautiful hotel - stayed for a very short break for anniversary prior to going on holiday. Staff were incredibly helpful and the hotel itself was lovely. Huge bed, very lush bedding and great bathroom. Everything that you would want in a hotel room, with a really impressive level of service."
June 2012,Fabulous Boutique Hotel,"41 is an elegant, intimate boutique hotel, sitting just down the street from Buckingham Palace.  My family just returned from a four night stay there and it exceeded our expectations.  41 occupies the fifth floor of its sister hotel, The Rubens, yet has its own entrance and lobby.  The decor is all black and white, with dark woods and brass, and is very tasteful and beautiful.  We were thrilled that, unlike most every other hotel we contacted in London, 41 was willing to put our three children in one suite.  (Apparently, a maximum of two to a room is the norm in much of Europe, and we were faced with the prospect of having to incur the cost of a third room on top of the already high daily rates resulting from our weak dollar).  My husband and I were in a room next door which had…"
June 2012,Can I live here?,"Can't wait to return.  Staff amazing, rooms comfy, location superb.  Stephan Ott made our stay over the top.  Didn't lift a finger.  Food awesome.  "
June 2012,Awesome!,"My husband and I spent three days at 41 during the Jubilee celebrations in June.  From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty, lots of special touches, ie champagne, flowers, fruit basket and excellent service.  Our room was large and well appointed with a very comfy bed.  Breakfast was a feast with good food and white table cloth service.  The hotel is well situated to walk to all the sights and there were lots of good restaurants close by.  I would highly recommend this property to anyone traveling to London, you will love the staff they work very hard to make your visit special."
June 2012,Perfect London Hotel if you want service and pampering,"Hotel 41 is simply divine. But it’s not the fabulous rooms, the amazing Executive Lounge, the exclusivity of it that makes this hotel simply stunning. It’s the level of service almost unparalleled in any other London Hotel that makes this place exceptional.  We came to Hotel 41 for 10 days for the Diamond Jubilee celebrations and for London in general. We wanted luxury, pampering and a great location. Hotel 41 is right across the road from Buckingham Palace, and about one block from Victoria tube station. Check-in was smooth and professional, and it started the way it went for the whole of our stay – everyone knew our name and we were never anonymous. We were treated professionally but with personal attention and always with a smile. Perfect.  First the rooms. We had a Junior…"
May 2012,A great experience !,"I chose this hotel for a trip to London to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday having done a fair amount of research on the internet. From the moment we arrived we were very well treated by the team, in particular Magdalena, who ensured we had all the necessary information for our stay.  When we arrived we were handed a glass of Champagne as we registered. The room itself was very comfortable and had real character. Nothing was too much trouble and for us the level of service struck just the right balance. We are now looking forward to booking a return visit later in the year !"
June 2012,"Sorry, rip off.","I booked this hotel on Costco Travel.  It sounded too good to be true.  This is NOT a five star hotel by any stretch of the imagination.  It is a wanna-be.  The restaurant part of the package is horrid in the library at Ruebens. Hotel 41 is only the 5th floor next to the Reuben's and the floor above us was very noisy with kids and lots of creaks and cracks.  Save your money for a real five star.  I would give this 3 star at best.  The wifi is intermittent and the free drinks and appetizers at cocktail hour does not include any alcohol.  This package is fine for the non experienced traveler, but all others find somewhere else as you will be happier.  The staff here was friendly but too intrusive.  Read the fine print.  Sorry for the lousy review but let others be forewarned.  As…"
March 2012,Most memorable stay,"My wife and I staed at 41 in March 2012 and had a wonderful time. It was our second stay at 41 and at the end of our first stay we said that the service was amazing, the food great but our room was a bit small. Well, on check in at the start of our second stay we were absolutely delighted to find that they had given us a bigger room (with no complaining just a reference in our check out review). We  were treated to the usual amazing service during the  stay but I must confess the topper was on my birthday when without requesting it, the staff gave us the romantic turndown (look it up) without notice and without charge!! I have never stayed at a hotel that has read my mind on what I wanted and did it before I could ask like 41. Iwish all hotels were this amazing. Please stay here…"
July 2012,"Fantastic hotel, the best service!","This hotel is a great find - the staff are so incredibly helpful, very attentive, polite and go the extra mile to make your stay extremely memorable. Normally we would stay at other 5 star hotels in London and would receive great service, but this is just on a different level. Very quiet, savoir beds with mattress toppers, superfine cotton bedlinen, unbelievable  breakfast (with pink champagne if required - which is also provided on arrival) and lovely executive lounge with honesty bar for late night drinks - but hotel very quiet and peaceful. Will return for sure - now my hotel of choice in London for business or pleasure."
August 2011,41 Gets it Right,"My wife and I stayed at 41 for our honeymoon, and loved everything about our stay.  The service is exceptional.  All the little touches are done well.    Without being obtrusive, the staff is vigilant and gets all the details right.  Every time we left the room it was straightened before our return.  Water at night, fruit left in your room as a snack, it is like the staff knows what you want before you want it.  The rooms are great, although we had to examine a few before settling on one with one that had high enough ceilings to accommodate my height.  The concierge was amazing and got us fantastic tickets (second row, center) to a sold out performance of Wicked on little notice.  If you have the means and will be in London, then stay at 41.  My wife and I look forward to…"
July 2012,"The real jewel in the crown in London is ""41""","For the third year in a row, my husband and I stayed at 41, aptly named for its location at 41 Buckingham Palace Road. Yes, it is right across the street from the Queen's residence and a short walk to The Green Park, St. James Park, all the sights, and great restaurants. You can walk anywhere from 41!  41 is part of the fabulous Red Carnation hotels, and 41 lives up to its 5 star rating. The staff know your name the moment you arrive (and from year to year), the accomodations are spectacular, the attention to detail is beyond any we've experienced anywhere in the world. You make friends with the staff, and no request is too big or too small. I can't imagine staying anywhere else in London. The combination of location, staff, and accommodations can't be beat. I am only worried in…"
June 2012,Wonderful,I had planned a special weekend for my best friends 50th birthday. Staying at hotel 41 was part of this and it was wonderful. Pink champagne on arrival and such a lovely reception from the staff. They were engaging and interested. The room was small but quality and we loved the 'whatever whenever' button on the phone. On returning to our room we found a birthday cake and two red roses on our beds boy did we feel special. What made us feel like princesses was the way we were treated with such interest and care. We adored the executive lounge with service on tap and the pantry to raid at will. Nothing was too much trouble and having requested a taxi for a certain time the receptionist even ran around the corner and up the road to find one and bring it back to the hotel for us.…
July 2012,Great location with amazing staff and elegance.,This is a great high end boutique hotel. The staff is awesome and make you feel welcome and important. Upon arrival we had a glass of champaign waiting and snacks to refresh us.  The room was huge (by london standards) and had air conditioning which was a bonus. The location was very convenient to just about everything. We were definitely pleased we picked this hotel over a chain or others. 
June 2012,Everything is 5 star,"We stayed a single night inour return to Australia after spending 6 weeks travelling Europe. We had decided to splurge for our last night are we were not disappointed. Everything from the greeting at reception, the complimentary champagne, the comfortable bedand room, the lounge where we were able to relax after a days shopping and enjoy complimentary cheese, nibbles and ice creams. All excellent. Great people and a great location!"
May 2012,Buckingham Palace Garden Party,"What a wonderful location for the palace!  After being invited along to one of this year's garden parties and after having this hotel recommended to us by friends who had stayed here previously, we booked a double room.  On arrival we checked in with a complimentary G & T and were told that our room was not available for us to change before rushing out to the palace, so we were upgraded to the Monarch suite! Our room was absolutely wonderful, clean crisp sheets, a wonderful night's sleep in a very comfy bed.  The following morning the breakfast was perfect, lots of choices. The staff were very helpful, friendly and very professional. We would definitely recommend this hotel to all!"
June 2012,Outstanding!,"We spent six days at 41 during our recent trip to London and quite simply it was a trip highlight. The rooms are not huge but they are incredibly well furnished with all the amenities. Its very luxurious. But the real treat is the staff. They are all wonderful. With all 28 rooms on one floor and with an Executive Lounge on the same floor, you have a perfect place to relax whenever there is a respite in your day and, of course, while doing so you interact with the staff. We were traveling with our two college age kids and all four of us loved the staff interaction and enjoyed the superb, but not pretentious service. There is always something to eat of drink there as well and the breakfast is fabulous. We have traveled extensively and its as good a hotel experience as we have ever…"
June 2012,"Very nice, but 'the best'???","Rented 2 rooms for 3-4 days.  The rooms are excellent, and immaculately appointed.  The personal service provided is excellent.  The food in the restaurant is superb...all at an impressive price.  Breakfast for 2 for ~$100?   Seems pretty steep.  Several 'hiccups' during our stay.  I requested flowers and chocolates in our daughters room (to celebrate their 2nd anniversary), and they were in our room.  My daughter asked about a visit to Buckingham Palace, and she was told that it was closed on the day she requested.  (6/30).  However, when walking past the Palace, we stopped by the office, and made her and her husband reservations for the visit, which went great (thanks to her perseverance, and not listening to our concierge).  Power from the floor plugs were 'off'' for several…"
June 2012,Live like the Royals!,"Choose this hotel immediately - it's the best hotel I've ever been to. Stayed with my mom for 5 nights to explore London for the first time (I'm 22). To be honest, this hotel was my favorite part of my visit!! First of all, the service is way beyond first class! Needed a new room change, printing items, searching for restaurants, recommendations on the city...and much more. I think all of our questions and need for assistance was perhaps a little too much, but the staff was always able to provide the best information with a smile. To add to my travel experience, I ended up losing my passport! The hotel staff asked for all possible places I may have lost it and called/searched for us 24/7. Every time I saw them, they were calling again and again. They told me, ""Enjoy your trip in…"
May 2012,A wonderful start to our trip,"We started our 3 week holiday in London, at Hotel 41. It was a perfect start to our trip, from the Range Rover transfer from Heathrow, to the champagne at check-in, we felt immediately welcomed. We stayed in the Conservatory Suite, with glass roof, and it was just lovely. We realized, much to our dismay, we had left our large camera behind on the plane. The hotel, particularly Remus, was instrumental in working with Virgin and ultimately getting our camera delivered to the hotel (much to our relief) the next morning.  Prior to our trip, we had asked the hotel to arrange Wicked tickets and had wonderful seats. We enjoyed snacks and wine in the executive lounge each evening, and enjoyed talking to the managers and staff.  The management team was outstanding, and very warm and…"
May 2012,Truly outstanding service,The common theme of most TA reviews is one of great service and this is truly the case. The staff here are exceptionally well trained and managed. They help and anticipate without this ever becoming burdensome. (one example was that they saw that my wife has mobility issues and changed the room they had planned to give us to one which was nearer the executive lounge). The food is good quality and the rooms are well decorated and laid out. I was really looking forward to staying at 41 and this sometimes builds expectations that are not met. I am very pleased to say that this was not the case with Hotel 41. We will be back.....
May 2012,Wow!,"We've had the great fortune to stay at some wonderful hotels in our travels.  We have to say that Hotel 41 takes the award for most personalized service.  The staff is attentive and friendly, every wish a traveler could have is anticipated, and anything you would want to pamper you is available by request if not already provided.  They had me at champagne as we checked in!  It only got better with the water, chocolates, slippers and linens by the bed at night, not to mention the candles lit in the bathroom.  They arranged tickets for the sites we wanted to visit and arranged transportation to the airport for us.  My husband and I had a wonderful time and will definitely stay here for every trip in London from now on!"
May 2012,Loved it!,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 last week and loved every day spent there. It is centrally located and less than a block from Victoria Station and literally steps away from Buckingham Palace.  From the minute we walked in, we were greeted by friendly staff at their first floor mini-lobby and escorted to check in on the fifth floor. Check in was very easy and straightforward and we were then escorted to our room and we were surprised by complimentary champagne and mini desserts. So lovely!  This was  perfect as my husband and I love anything sweet.   The room itself is small but well appointed-Bose station with ipod/iphone docking, flat screen wall mounted tv in the room & bathroom and free wi-fi. The bed is very comfortable but took up most of the space in the room but it…"
May 2012,Excellence among excellence,I have stayed at many 5 star hotels but this hotel is by far the best among them all. The staff are all about anticipating your needs. They are professional and personable but never intrusive. The attention to detail is incredible and nothing is to much trouble. You are always made to feel welcome and comfortable and the location is so handy to everthing. You are just a 2 minute walk to the undergroung and Buckingham palace is outside your door. I have staryed at many of the leading hotels in London but this hotel surpasses them all. The roomas are immaculate and well finished and the bathroom is generous and spotless. Treat yourself and enjoy all it has to offer.
May 2012,Great Service,We were welcomed like returning customers despite this being our first stay. All the staff were polite and attentive and the room was lovely.
March 2012,Lovely stay,"We've stayed at this hotel for my husband birthday for 2 nights in March. The hotel is situated not even 10 minutes walk. The location is brilliant and it's just next to Buckingham palace. Great for London sightseeing!  The entrance of the hotel can be surprising as it's a small door and a little desk and a corridor. But it didn't bother us.  You are then taken to the main lounge where the check in is done as well as being the breakfast & lounge area. It is beautifully decorated and loads of natural lights. When I've booked the room, I had a choice to pick of several extras. I've decided to go for the high tea. The high tea was lovely and the staff very polite and nice. We've requested an early check-in if possible and when we arrived the room was available.  The hotel is small…"
April 2012,The service in Hotel 41 is very special!!,"The rooms in this hotel are small, but very confortable!! The service is very good and special!!! The breakfast is good. We liked the hotel, but the location isn't the best."
June 2011,Top Notch,Top place. Really good views and food was top notch too. Would recommend to anyone thinking of staying here. Great location too
May 2012,A perfect pocket in London!,"My husband took me to 41 for my Birthday, just lovely! How refreshing to find a hotel which ticks all the boxes, just super to stay somewhere fabulous and to be made to feel we were absolutely welcome too! Monika checked us in with a glass of Champagne, our room was great with all the smashing extras in the bathroom. After the matinee, we returned to our room to find a floating candle glowing away, lights dimmed, music playing and a Birthday cake.. Magical touches! We had a bottle of Veuve in the lounge and along came canapés. The following day the sun was still shining, so walked up to The Palace before heading back for breakfast (serve until 1pm on sundays) We enjoyed London, ate at Scotts then back to 41 by 9pm, my husband read the papers, i watched television.. Happy to…"
September 2011,Fails on a value for money basis,"It's like expecting a trip in a Rolls Royce and then being ferried around in a Toyota, even though you've paid Rolls Royce rates.  This place lacks typical hotel infrastructure and must be very cheap to run.  There is little character and atmosphere.  The big trick is how the staff like Monica and Magda are constantly all over you, distracting you from pondering the shortcomings.   In other words, the chauffeur of the Toyota tries to make the trip worthwhile.  You will never find royalty, captains of industry, movie stars or such people staying here - it simply lacks too much to be in their sights. I think that this place is very poor value for money and would find many better alternatives at the price point."
May 2012,Didn't want to leave,"This hotel was the perfect find.  The amenities are excellent, attention to detail impressive, and the service is fabulous.  Everything was so wonderful that we decided to extend our stay at the expense of non refundable travel tickets.  We will definitely be back."
May 2012,Impeccable service,"My wife, daughter, and I spent a brief stay at Hotel 41 during a recent stop over in London.  From the moment we arrived, Frederic, Magda, and the entire staff could not have been more pleasant and helpful.  We have stayed at several 5-star hotels in the past, and as far as service is concerned, I can't say I have ever had better than what we received at Hotel 41.  The building that the hotel is in is over 100 years old.  As you can imagine, the rooms are a bit smaller than newer hotels, but the entire property is very nicely appointed with all the modern conveniences.  We received a complimentary upgrade to a Hospitality Suite with a king bed, and my daughter loved having her own ""room"" with a fold-out couch.  The Executive Lounge is a great place for breakfast or snacks…"
May 2012,Very Nice,"Great service, food, room and location.  Close to the tube, tourist attractions, many restaurants and of course Buckingham Palace."
April 2012,41 Hotel is the Best!,"My wife and I stayed with two nine year old twins, daughter (25) and son (28) this past April. While the London weather was stormy, the staff made our stay perfect. Monika, Victoria and Roman all did a fabulous job and could not have done more to make us all feel welcome and special.  We’ve stayed at most of the big London hotels (Savoy, Four Seasons, Mandarin, Claridge’s, etc) as well as the smaller boutiques (The Berkley, Blakes, etc), and the 41 Hotel is a gem amongst them. It’s small, intimate and situated in a perfect location in Mayfair. The rooms were fabulous and well equipped. The Executive lounge reminds us of visiting a friend’s English country house. But most of all, the staff is exceptional; friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and no task is too large or small, to…"
May 2012,Pure pleasure!,"My third stay at Hotel 41 and it was perfect! Upon check-in in the beautiful library lobby I received a complimentary upgrade to a king size room without asking and a refreshing flute of champagne. The staff was as expected, delightful, attentive, helpful and anticipated my every need-including finding the boutique shop that sold a favorite brand of French clothing :)  The location is suberb and we walked everywhere and were happy to return to a pleasant dinner in front of the fireplace in the library dining area.  The room was comfortable and well-appointed and I awoke rested for another hectic fun-filled day in London.  We'll always stay at Hotel 41.  Kudos to Frederic and his staff for making my trip pure pleasure."
May 2012,We felt like we were a guest in a beautiful home,"This small hotel was our home away from home in London. Thanks Freddie, Madga, Jasmeet and all of the staff at 41 for making my husband's birthday trip so wonderful.The room with the king size bed, food and service was excellent. We will have to come up with some excuse to return to London to stay at this wonderful hotel again."
May 2012,Reality check is in order - this is not the real deal!,"When you’re top of the pile on a global site like Trip Advisor, you get the privilege of charging premium rates on the basis that people will be willing to pay more for the perception of a superior offering.  That weight of expectation can be a burden and may result in far more thorough analysis than would otherwise be necessary.  In other words, discerning travellers will expect you to deliver.  The overwhelmingly positive reviews persuaded me to stay here for 3 nights.  For just about £400 per night, I was paying the same that could have got me into the Ritz, Savoy, Langham or Claridges.  Was it going to be worth it and what would the experience be like?  First Impressions: There is no entrance area or lobby.  In fact there is nothing but a passage to a lift which takes you up…"
May 2012,My favourite hotel ever,We have just returned from our second stay at 41.  Everything about the hotel is absolutely perfect.  I almost don't want to give them another good review as it'll be impossible to get reservations if everybody finds out how fabulous this place is!
March 2012,justified,"believe all the good reviews! Stayed here for our wedding anniversary and were completely blown away by the service, luxury and location. Frederik and all the staff were beyond brilliant. Cannot think of anything that would improve this hotel apart from the few things I mentioned to Frederik which were rectified immidiately. I you want something special, this is the place to go!"
April 2012,Top of the Line Hotel,"I stayed at Hotel 41 for three nights and it was fabulous.  The room was spacious compared to other Englsh rooms, and the amenities were incredible - everything you would expect and more including a TV in the bathroom, robes, slippers, and a great turndown service.  The lounge was wonderful, an the service was excellent.   The staff was very attentive.  If you decide to stay here, be prepared to be pampered.  The personal attention is a little ""over the top"" compared to soe American hotels and takes some getting used to, but everyone was friendly and courteous to the extreme.  Hotel 41 is within easy walking distance of Buckingham Palace and St James Park, and there are some nice pubs and shops right around the corner.  We were given excellent suggestions for dinner and…"
May 2012,Loved and hated in equal measure,"My husband precisely described my feelings about this hotel when he said ""I loved and hated it in equal measure"".   Hotel 41 has many admirable aspects. Obviously the location is fantastic. The decor is marvellous, with beautiful wall coverings, rich woods and thoughtfully chosen accessories. The bedroom which we stayed in was very well appointed with every need anticipated. We slept soundly in great comfort in the huge bed. I particularly enjoyed the wonderful rain shower. The linens, bathrobes and towels were all of the most luxurious quality. They provide, as frequently mentioned, lots of lovely snacks. We were given a beautiful cake.   Hotel 41 disappointed us with their style of service. I appreciate that this is converse to many other reviews. I really feel that the…"
May 2012,very nice hotel,"We just stayed in Hotel 41 for two nights and enjoyed our stay very much ! The room was big enough (compared to other hotel rooms in London), location is great, people are very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is good!  Nicole and Riccardo"
May 2012,excellent!,"41 Hotel is a small boutique hotel a couple of blocks away from Victoria station and Buckingham Palace. The room size is very good for european standards. Very clean too. The staff is extremely attentive. They were really nice! Breakfast was very good. I think this is a special hotel for couples, very quiet, private and comfortable. I highly recommend it and would certainly stay again."
February 2012,"Hotel 41,London,UK",What a fantastic experience and pleasure to stay at 41.The Staff excelled in every way and by far one of the finest hotels.I travel the world and am yet to find a hotel to match 41.Well done to the Management and staff.Keep up the brilliant service and professionalism. Regards Mike Coburn
April 2012,Most Memorable Experience in my 28 Years,As a seasoned traveller I have spent many nights in London's five star hotels.  Having lived in London for the last four years I decided to treat myself to a stay at this wonderful establishment.  In my university years I used to travel through Victoria quite frequently and came across 41 at one point though never really thought about staying then.  Upon arrival at the property which is very well situated with easy access to public transport and an abundant selection of sights and museums(In my eighteen years here I finally made it to see Buckingham Palace).  When you enter the property you are greeted by a warm and friendly member of staff who will let the reception staff know (upstairs on the fifth floor).   Soon you are whisked to the executive lounge (do not let the name…
April 2012,Anniversary,This is a really top notch hotel with excellent service that goes beyond expectations. Very friendly without beeing intrusive. Very stylish with lots of well thought out designs. Worth the money for special occasions. To bad they could not rule over the weather also.
February 2012,Great hotel for Holiday,"Spent 2 nights in London with Hotel 41 was a beautiful time to me. The hotel had a wonderful location (very close to the Buckingham Palace and the St James Park). The stylish and well appointed and exceptionally clean rooms made the hotel really a great place to relax after long journey. There was a pool in the hotel which just made me want to jump into it right away. The staff was so hospitality, friendly, willing to response to any of our requests. The hotel really made me feel that I am at home not in a strange place. Come and stay with the hotel, you will experience the best service ever."
April 2012,Truly exceptional hotel.,"I stayed here for two nights in April. The warm staff makes you feel like you've entered a welcoming club from the moment you first enter the ""hidden"" entry. The library is simply amazing, as is the staff. I think they all knew my name within 20 minutes of arrival. I will definitely return here on my next stop in London. "
April 2012,Old fashioned attention to service,I stayed for one night and found the whole experience excellent. As a regular user of 5 star hotels in London I can safely say this hotel ranks with the best. Small and unusual the whole focus is upon personal service from the moment you arrive through to the moment you leave.
May 2012,A perfection of timing,"Another lovely stay at 41, and this time we were on a tight schedule.  We were guests at a formal occasion nearby, during which there was an interlude.  41 is for residents only, but we had asked if we could invite our hosts to visit us briefly and privately in our suite for refreshments as this was a special day.  We arranged for champagne, fruit and snacks to be left in our suite for our  mid-event half hour.  When we arrived, the whole suite had been serviced, although we were checking out that day, so our friends were able to freshen up in a gleaming bathroom free of our used towels and soap and without passing a rumpled bed. The requested refreshments were beautifully presented (berries of superb quality alongside the famous home- toasted nuts) in the downstairs sitting…"
May 2012,Exceptional,"This place is ranked #1 in London on TripAdvisor for good reason - I've never felt more welcome at a hotel.  The accommodations, service, food and staff were impeccable.  Every details is well thought out, from the champagne reception to the late-night snack bar.  I highly recommend  this beautiful hotel for any special occasion."
May 2012,Exceptional Boutique Hotel,"Frederic Dallot, resident manager and his assistant Monica are the dynamic duo! Their attention to detail and friendly caring attitude made our stay at 41 memorable. Their level of service is exemplary. Having stayed at some of the finest hotels in the world, we can say with confidence that  you can not be treated better anywhere. The rooms are charming and romantic; we celebrated our 40th anniversary in style. Next year, we plan on celebrating our 41st at 41."
April 2012,What a Gem,My husband and I enjoyed yet another stay at 41. Frederic and his staff go to great lenghts to ensure that everything is perfect. Do try the romantic turndown and the Butlers pantry.
May 2012,A very nice boutique hotel providing an exceptionally high level of service.,"Charmingly unassuming from the pavement, 41 is a delight from the moment you step inside. Upon entering staff provide a friendly welcome, with the Front Desk Manager escorting you to the 5th floor haven above Buckingham Palace Road. A glass of Champagne is offered on arrival to the Lounge, where check-in formalities are completed efficiently (and with a personal touch).  The ‘Executive Room’ (18 square metre variant) was well appointed, with nice attention to detail – from the ’41’ embroidered linen and towels, to the Penhaligon toiletries in the bathroom. The turndown service was personable.  The ‘Executive Lounge’ was impressive, with the feel of a private club from a bygone age. Providing a personal welcome, by name, I found service was attentive whilst discrete.  Whilst it…"
April 2012,Fantastic stay,"Booked this as an overnight stay because of the fantastic reviews on Trip Adviser, it met and exceeded our expectations.  This is definitely THE place to stay in London. Amazing rooms, super staff, nothing too much trouble. Would definitely recommend to anyone and am looking forward to a return visit."
April 2012,we will be returning,"To anyone looking for a hotel which is right in the heart of london and can claim 10/10 from clients then hotel 41 is for you. the service, staff , maids and those behind the scenes makes this hotel in the category of excellent. The effort they went to for arranging dinner bookings in restaurants that were booked out was fantastic - thank you. We will be returning.B.W. australia"
April 2012,a wonderful place to stay,What can one say when one finds perfection - that sums up our experience at the hotel 41.From the moment we were picked up by their arranged service at heathrow to the warm personal goodbye at checkout everything was wonderful. Other reviews have gone into the rooms and amenities and food and all and these reviews were totally true. To me what makes the hotel so unusual in todays day and age is the degree of detail that goes into making the guest feel so very very special including anniversary celebrations and any and all special requests.One special example was remembering we were going to see the musical singin in the rain and that night having the cd playing as part of the turn down service when we returned.The whole staff led by general manager Frederic and Assistant Manager…
May 2012,Staff and location make the stay worthwhile....,"We read all the reviews online about 41 and they were the major reason we chose it. If you've ever stayed in a suite at the Bellagio or at the Ritz Carlton on the club level.......it's NOTHING like that. They basically took the 5th floor of the adjoining Rubens Hotel and made 28 rooms into a boutique hotel. We chose an Executive King room, which is an upgrade from the standard rooms, and it was very nicely furnished, immaculately clean, and had everything we needed. Certainly small by U.S. standards, but we expected as much in London.  The location speaks for itself. Just outstanding. A very short walk to the Palace, parks, shopping, eateries, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, and even the London Eye if you're up for a longer stroll. What makes this place is the staff and service. It…"
April 2012,A great discovery,"We usually stay at the Chesterfield Hotel but on our last trip the Chesterfield was full (we had changed our plans last minute)  and the Staff very kindly arranged a room for us a room at Hotel 41. We thought the Hotel was lovely particularly the lounge area. We were greeted with a glass of champagne when checking in and the staff were very efficient, attentive and accommodating and seemed to have a genuine feeling of pride in the Hotel. We stayed in one of the Hospitality Suites which was very nice.  The only small negative comment I would make is that the room had so much furniture it it there wasn't much room to move around  in or put suitcases etc but that seems to be typical of London Hotels and it certainly would not stop me returning to this hotel. The Management and…"
July 2011,Amazing....Sexy....Romantic...everything you could want!,"We have stayed at this hotel 3 times, the first we stayed in the hospitality suite it is such a stunning room with everything in the hotel being black and white it really works. The suite is huge everything you could possible want or need my only criticism is the size of the bath it is such a shame it is not a bit bigger as this would make it perfect! Everyone is really friendly, glass of champagne on arrival, we had room service on this occasion and it was really nice most hotels fall down on room service but nope can't complain about anything.   The next time we stayed in the conservatory suite erm it's a lovely suite the bathroom is amazing , the bath is perfect would be nice if it was in the hospitality suite. Being able to open up the blind and look up at the stars is very…"
March 2012,I've found my home from home at 41!,"We booked this hotel based on the recommendations on Trip Advisor and it is proof the system really works! From the minute we arrived we were cocooned in the most excellent customer care I have ever experienced, which as a seasoned traveller is saying a lot. Frederic, Remus, Julian and all the other staff made us so welcome and there was nothing that was too much trouble. The rooms, both public and bedrooms, are beautifully presented with dozens of little details for your added comfort. We had two Junior Suites - individual in design but uniformly delightful in style and amenties, and with the most comfortable bed ever! 41 - now that I've found you, you've become my second home in London!"
February 2012,The Best Hotel I Have Ever Stayed At!,"I took my girlfriend (now fiance) to propose to her that evening at the hotel and it was the best choice I have ever made. The hotel staff were by far the sole reason for our total enjoyment. Their attention to detail is something to be desired and the rooms were outstanding. After enjoying a complimentary glass of champagne when checking in, we went to our room and minutes later had a phone call from reception to ask if we want to move to an upgraded room which had become available due to a cancellation. We were upgraded to an executive king which was very spacious and well equiped. I also ordered the romantic turndown and they must have used dozens of roses to scatter petals all over the room, the setting was perfect. This was organised while we were at dinner, and there was…"
February 2012,The Best Kept Secret!,"My husband and I are seasoned travelers, and I am very picky about hotels. Hotel 41 is, by far, my favorite hotel I have stayed in. London's best kept secret is no more! From the moment you walk through the unassuming entrance, a world of elegance, refinement, charm, and exquisite service awaits you. Our two level suite was beautiful with fine linens, contemporary furnishings, an inviting fireplace, two flat screen TVs, and the added touches in the evening of burning candles, tasty chocolates, and bottled water. But it is in the Library where the true pampering awaits. Seated by a crackling fire surrounded by tasteful elegance, the professional staff greet and serve you with a sense of grace and style. Who knew the mere presentation of tea could be made into a true art form?…"
February 2012,"Wonderful location, professional and friendly staff","My husband I were celebrating our 10th Wedding Anniversary and wanted guaranteed 5 star accomodation and service. We were not dissapointed. We were warmly welcomed from the moment we stepped inside this lovely hotel. Every single member of staff was friendly, polite and professional lead by Magda and Freddie. When I had realised that I had forgotten my inner soles for my shoes for the evening, one member of staff went out and got them for me! I couldn't believe it.  Breakfast was amazing. The hotel is small but stunning and situated yards from Buckingham Palace and a 5 min walk to the tube station. We would definetly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting luxury and 5 star service. We will go back with our little girl next time. Thank you Hotel 41 for a truly lovely stay."
August 2011,I can only echo the words of others here,"""simply the best"". 10/10; 5 *; 100%.  This must be as close to heaven as you can get on earth."
January 2012,"""Simply the Best""","I took my girlfriend here for a surprise for her birthday back in January. I have been very fortunate to travel around the world and stayed in quite a few wonderful hotels BUT Hotel 41 is SIMPLY the BEST hotel I have ever stayed in by far!  From the moment I made the reservation and informed the hotel that I was bringing my g/f here for her birthday as a surprise I was given so many ideas/options to make her day even more special.  I was provided with a form prior to arrival so that Hotel 41 could accommodate any special requests. The form included information such as pillow menu, if we required any particular magazines, music etc.   Once we arrived at Hotel 41 we were greeted to by a very warm welcome by the doorman, that escorted us to reception. We were offered a glass of…"
February 2012,Best hotel reception ever,"This is the best hotel staffs I have ever experienced!   Excellent service, wonderful attention and with heart and sincerity. I have been travelling for more than 15 years and never wrote a feedback, be it good or bad, though I had more than fair share of bad experience and at times, was really tempted to write to complain.   However, my stay at Hotel 41 was so great that it prompted me, for the first time, to write in and compliment them. In addition to the great hotel staffs, who among many things, were helpful, offered me a boardroom for my breakfast meeting, good dessert plate in my room, brought me a set of tea after check-in. The room is exquisite and location good.   This is more than boutique, it's a one with class and service. Now I understand why it's the smallest (28…"
February 2012,London Luxury,"I have stayed at ""41"" on average one week a month for the past year.  The hotel is my ""home away from home"" as I travel from the US to Europe quite often for business. The rooms are wonderful, but it's the staff that make my stays remarkable!  I can't think of anywhere else I'd rather stay when in London!"
December 2011,Heaven,"If heaven was a hotel it would be Hotel 41. You 'go to the light' through a beautiful but low key front door. Whereupon you are greeted buy a very pleasant man who shows you the way. Which of course is through some golden gates, you then ascend on high in a golden elevator. At reception you are welcomed by a few angelic members of staff. Who's only job is make sure you stay there is 'heavenly'. Which is helped with a glass of bubbles.  But seriously. This hotel is amazing. No request is to big or to small. The atmosphere is one of grand opulence and also a romantic hideaway. It has many reasons to be the best hotel you've ever stayed in, but for me the main reason is the staff. They are very professional and yet remain the most friendly people. The turn down service is the most…"
February 2012,A truly praiseworthy boutique hotel of exceptional standard,"My wife and I spent 3 days here during mid-February 2012, and found it every bit as good as the many positive reviews had led us to believe. What differentiates 5-star hotels is not so much their infrastructure, but rather their staff, and that of the ""41"" is quite simply exceptional. We are used to good service but rarely in 40 years of extensive travelling have we met staff of the standard of the ""41"": personable, welcoming, impeccable, polyglot, immensely helpful, and genuinely friendly, they made our stay a real joy. The crisp linens, warm duvets, heavy robes and (somewhat recalcitrant but nevertheless cheerful) gas fire also turned our spacious room into a welcome haven from the unexpectedly cold London February weather, as did the well-appointed lounge with its gentlemen's…"
February 2012,"Romantic, eclectic, boutique   hideaway, in central location","This is a very special boutique hotel.  The service is cheerful and attentive and was the perfect 20th anniversary treat for my husband and I.  Our stay was made all the more delightful due to the fact that the hotel became a sanctuary away from a heavy snowfall.  London had come to a standstill so after trudging past some familiar London landmarks in the snow, it was wonderful to access the delights of the executive lounge and snuggle by the open fire.  An added surprise was the fabulous romantic turndown, with rose petals scattered in the bedroom and bathroom and floating candles.  The anniversary cake, which had not been prearranged, but very welcomed, topped our evening.  The breakfast was equally tasty and professionally presented and cooked.  Would definitely recommend…"
February 2012,What a Gem!,"From the moment I set food in the classic entrance of the 41 Hotel, I was met with friendly smiles, great conversation, top class service and a lovely (and LARGE) flute of clear champagne. I have nothing but good words for this hotel and I highly recommend it to everyone. The hotel boats gorgeous classic english decor complete with mahogany oak, black and white checks and luxurious leather couches. The rooms are beautiful, spacious and luxurious. The executive lounge has a lovely private gentleman's club feel that I enjoyed immensely. My highest praise goes to the wonderful set of staff they have at this hotel. They were genuinely interested in their guests which is rare to see in hotels nowadays. Mr. Frederic Dallot in particular was fabulously witty and interesting.   When you…"
February 2012,Impeccable: perfect in every way!,"From start to finish, our experience in Hotel 41 was exceptional.  As others have, justifiably, commented the staff are brilliant.  Nothing is too much trouble and they look after their guests immaculately.  The reception staff are geuinely interested in their guests and were excellent.    The lounge is lovely, well appointed and pristinely clean.  We enjoyed a gorgeus afternoon tea there and then in the evening a crisp glass of chablis accompanied by delicious canapes.  We did indeed ""plunder the pantry"" one evening, also delicious and served with grace by an ever helpful staff member.  Our room lived up to expectations and I am fussy about certain features such as the quality of the bed, little touches of luxury and the bathroom products.  On all counts, Hotel 41 was perfect. …"
January 2012,"""First Class""","We stayed for three nights in January and had a first class experience from start to finish.  The entire staff were the perfect combination of professional and personable at the same time.  We truly enjoyed our afternoon tea after a long day, with Michael being our server.  The room was comfortable and well appointed.  Thank you Freddie and Monika for a wonderful stay!  We look forward to our return in December."
February 2012,Simply Fabulous,"The world is a much better place for having Hotel 41 in it. I wish for everyone that they had a chance to experience it. It really is a treasure. Hotel 41 in London is a  real gem so if you get a chance, spoil yourself and experience Hotel 41.  This hotel is everything other reviewers have said in their reviews that convinced me to book it for my time in London.  I wondered if my expectations might be too high due to such rave reviews, but I was not disappointed (and I can be picky).  It's very professional but homely at the same time. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff, any of the staff at any time....they are all equally helpful and lovely.   My son and I shared an 'executive room' with twin beds', room 4106. I understand all the rooms are all unique in some way. The…"
January 2012,Excellent Hotel,"I stayed at Hotel 41 in late January 2012 on the recommendation of my travel agent.  The staff were incredibly helpful (getting direction, hailing cabs, storing luggage,etc.), the room was very comfortable (comfy bed and the bathroom had a shower and a tub in it).  The executive lounge offers an elegant and quiet spot to relax at the end of the day, grab a snack, read a bit and have a drink.  Room service was also very good.  The location is superb, right next to Buckingham Palace and a 10-minute walk to Westminister Abbey.  Close to Mayfair with great shopping and, if you're in the business, lots of hedge fund offices.  I'll definitely stay here again."
February 2012,This is how a 'real' 5 star hotel should behave!,"41 Hotel at Buckingham Palace Road, London is just superb. This is how a 5 star hotel should behave. Warm and sincere welcome and service is second to none. Private hotel but it feels like coming home. Rooms fully equipped, even with Continental European sockets!  Ever heard a 5 star hotel offering you instantly a coffee or tea with your wake up call?? It's like you have your own butler. Breakfast delicious and again with top service and smile (!). Although on a very busy business trip in London, I never felt more refreshed the following morning. Highly recommended! Great to learn that Superb service and luxury really still exists!"
February 2012,The jewel in the crown,Situated just behind Buckingham Palace this compact bespoke hotel cannot be beaten.  The staff are friendly and helpful. Nothing is to much trouble.  Your receive a wonderful welcome from you arrive until you leave.  I recommend it to anyone staying in London as you will NEVER be disappointed.
February 2012,Fantastic Experience,"We had asked before arriving at Hotel 41 if we could have a early check-in. Our room was ready by 11am which was great. The staff were very welcoming as soon as we stepped into the hotel. We were shown around the 'Executive Suite' and told that Breakfast, Snacks,and 'Plunder The Pantry' was served there at no extra cost ( except for drinks ). Every member of staff were very efficient, smiling, nothing was too much trouble for them especially the resident manager. Our room was very clean and fresh. Very comfortable bed and pillows, even a pillow menus was available. The bathroom was spotless, I enjoyed taking a bath while watching the TV on the wall in the bathroom! If we are lucky enough to stay in London again, my first choice of hotel would be Hotel 41 as this was an…"
November 2011,Fantastic,"I booked this as a present for my fiancé, after checking the reviews from trip advisor. I am so glad I did. From the moment we arrived we felt so welcomed, so relaxed and made to feel special. We were greeted at the door and helped with all our baggage and pushchair, and taken to the executive lounge. All our luggage was taken care of, and there was lots of it due to baby necessities. We had come to london to visit some friends, and they were welcomed in too, given access to the executive lounge, refreshments and nibbles. At all times you were just made to feel special.  Our room was decorated to the highest standard, and I loved the sense of quirkyness and individuality that came across unlike standardised layouts and sterile environments. Having asked for a cot in the room it…"
December 2011,"Just perfect, an oasis of peace in London","This was our second time at the Hotel 41 and we decided to come back as our first stay had been truly great and romantic. This time we were less busy than the first one and we could enjoy the hotel more and I have to say they can create such an amazing atmosphere that one enjoy almost most being at the hotel than being in the city. Every single member of the staff if always there to help, everyone is kind and caring and they all do their very best to assure you the best possible vacation. Rooms are comfortables and our had a lovely fireplace which was great, I think the best night was when we just stayed in bed sipping hot chocolate and watching a dvd at the fireplace light! We also managed to have a pre dinner cocktail in the lounge every night and have to say the christmas…"
November 2011,Luxurious as ever,"This was my fourth stay at 41 and my first during christmas time, so when I arrived in London, I was excited to see what my ""home away from home"" would look like.  Arriving at the hotel I was greeted by a wonderful christmas decoration around the door, which made me feel comfy the moment I stepped in (even more comfy than normally, which is impressive). I was sleeping in room 4111 this time, and my high expectations (I had slept in one of the suites last time) were instantly fulfilled when I discovered my room had a fireplace. Espescially during christmas time this is a wonderful feature to have in your hotel bedroom.  The room was big, with one window facing to the rear of the hotel in the direction of Victoria station, the other, in the bathroom, towards Buckingham Palace. One…"
November 2011,Wow,"We booked because of travel advisor reviews. On arrival the lady at the lobby greeted us with enthusiasm and explained how the hotel worked. It would be easy to miss the entrance, a discrete door between a restaurant and the Reubens Hotel, but the taxi man knew it - usually a good sign. Three staff attended to us in the executive lounge.  Our room was super with it's own gas fire, comfy bed and bathroom which had a real bath and a separate shower.  We went with the hotel recommendation for dinner an Indian restaurant Quillion which was great.  Later we noticed some faults in the room to do with lighting and tv.  Next morning the hotel fixed these and offered free drinks as an apology - always the test of an establishment, what it does when things go wrong."
November 2011,Completely satisfied with stay,"We stayed at the 41 for over a week and every day was a delight. It is well situated for tourists in particular with Buckingham Palace a 5 minute walk in one direction and Victoria underground and train station about 5 minutes walk in the other direction.  Our room was very comfortable, we stayed in an executive king room and had plenty of space. The bed was so cosy and wonderful, it was hard to get out of some mornings! The room, including the bathroom, was spotlessly cleaned every day. We appreciated the little touches at turndown every evening including restful music and weather information for the next day. We had breakfast included in our rate and afternoon tea during our stay, the breakfasts were delicious and filling and the afternoon tea was fantastic! In particular the…"
November 2011,Sadly disappointed,"I have never stayed in a 5 star hotel with such a small double bed. Our room was small, with a tiny bathroom. The bathroom tiles had been partially patched, leaving an obvious rectangle on the wall where perhaps something had been removed.  On our first night, after asking not to be disturbed, and going to bed early after a long journey, we were woken by reception phoning to check that everything was alright with our room.  We also had a sheet with a small hole in it and a towel that gave way on the edge.  The staff were all very friendly, a bit too friendly for our introverted selves! We couldn't get from our room to the street without saying hello to two or three staff members on the way.  In summary, if friendly, attentive staff, and a cosy atmosphere are what defines a good…"
November 2011,"Fantastic Hotel, Great Staff, Wonderful Experience","My wife and I just returned home after 3 great nights spent at Hotel 41.  From the location close to Buckingham Palace, Victoria Tube Station, and many of the have-to-see sights of London to the fantastic service from the 41 staff, you cannot go wrong with this lovely boutique hotel.  Some folks may say it is expensive, but not if you consider the gourmet breakfast, snacks all during the day, and evening hours-dourves.  You need only to find a place to eat lunch while you are out enjoying the sights.  This was our second stay at the 41 and it only re-inforced the wonderful experience we had in 2005. This is a must stay hotel."
November 2011,Wonderful Experience,"Our family alway consults Trip Advisor before reserving hotel accommodations.  The reviews of this hotel were ALL positive; especially about the staff.  My father served in the 8th Air Corp during WWII; so one of the reasons for my trip to London was to visit WWII memorials to the ""Mighty Eighth.""  The hotel concierge (Julian) was so helpful in this regard (finding the addresses, printing out directions and what tube/trains to take).  I stayed at the hotel for 10 days and was treated royally.  The king-bed room was clean and very comfortable.  The location is excellent...block from Buckingham Palace and St. James Park; down the Pall Mall to the Nat'l Gallery etc, etc.  But it is the hotel staff that makes 41 such a great place to stay.  I will return soon"
September 2011,Wonderful,"Stunning hotel, superb staff, great location.  Perfect!"
October 2011,Wow - what an experience,I was lucky to stay here thanks to a gift from my former employer and what an experience.  I can not fault ANYTHING about this hotel.  From the service of the staff to the quality of the hotel room nothing can be faulted.    I will definitely be returning again.
February 2012,41 trip,"Outstanding hotel.  the Trip Advisor rating for theis Hotel is SPOT ON   The experience from beginning to end was amazing (even though we incorrectly arrived at the Rubens next door, we were immediately ushered through the ""secret door"" to 41, making you feel like very important guests!) .  Monika and her team seem to have it running perfectly and make you feel like they really do appreciate your business.  As our waitress said in the lounge “you’ll never go hungry in this hotel”.  The complimentary side is fantastic, service spot on and on time with breakfast in our room which was very tasty.  I hope to be back here on a very regular basis.  We have always rated the Red Carnation Group of hotels and previously favoured the Chesterfield in the West End BUT we will now go to the…"
February 2012,Awesome Experience,"I stayed here for several days while on business in London. The hotel is immaculate and the staff are extremely helpful and courteous. The atmosphere was genuine and not stuffy. The day I was leaving, London was dealing with a major snowstorm to them and the airport was canceling flights etc. I was on my way to Paris on the Eurostar and they spent time calling to verify the trains were going to run and even called a cab to come and pick me up. They also offered to allow me to stay and would even take care of getting new tickets for the Eurostar for the next day if needed. I love the place. The food was excellent , the staff were all excellent. They really do go out of their way to make you feel at home. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to be pampered.."
January 2012,Fabulous service and lovely oasis in great location!,We recently returned from a 3 night stay at Hotel 41.  The service was exceptional. The rooms were beautifully appointed. The highlight was the lounge which was a quiet and clubby respite from the bustle of the city. Freddie and his staff are world class.
February 2012,Perfection,We had a fantastic 2 nights at hotel 41. The staff are very friendly and helpful and made everything very easy for us.
August 2011,Elegance,"The perfect hotel that is well maintained. Good services. The staff very friendly. If you want luxury and confort, you can stay there. Highly recommended."
January 2012,60th Birthday Celebration,"My son and I have just returned from a three night stay at the 41, celebrating my 60th birthday and I can't praise the hotel highly enough. It was wonderful in every way (apart from the television which was rather small and old) from its perfect central location near Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station, the comfort and warmth of its rooms with so many extra personal touches (there was a delicious birthday cake waiting for me on arrival) and, last but not least, the staff. The service is outstanding, very friendly but courteous and extremely personal. Nothing is too much trouble and they always asked after our day when we returned to the hotel. Everyone helped to make our stay and my birthday celebration so very special."
January 2012,Weekend away with daughter for my 60th birthday.,"Fabulous Hotel,lovely staff,felt very safe in a wonderful setting.Buckingham Palace just over the road.Hospitality was second to none.Had the breakfast and the afternoon tea,both were excellant.Stayed in many London Hotels,because my daughter lives there,and I  visit three or four times a year,so we stay in different Hotels,its like a little holiday each visit.This was the best ever,The room was beautiful,many little touchs,chocs,candles,olives,lovely dressing gowns and slippers,the fire was light when we returned from an evening in the lounge and a little trip in the night air.It was a little expensive,but hey what price a lovely memory,you can't put a price on that.Would love to re visit,maybe at Xmas,Thanks again to all the lovely staff,for a lovely Birthday,still eating the…"
September 2011,Very romantic,"We came here for business/romantic trip. We loved this hotel. Staff was very accommodating. They sent us to a great breakfast place around the corner and also arranged a private car for our return to the airport. My husband was working so I checked in alone and I was very early, so they took our bags and I went exploring the area. When I came back everything was ready. Room wasn't big but we enjoyed the cozy feel to it. We had after dinner drinks sent to our room at night which was very romantic. The location is also a plus. Bucking ham palace is barely a block away and the gardens were beautiful to take a nap or people watch."
July 2011,I do get the hype of this hotel.,This is a very personal Hotel with great service.  We felt as though we were a guest not just another number.  When you enter the reception/lounge area it feels like you have entered a different world.  The location is brilliant right next to Buckingham Palace.  It took the stress out of a London visit as we could walk to many places such as Westminster.    You can pay a lot less for hotels in London but id recommend Hotel 41 as its a different experience. Couldnt fault it.
December 2011,DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE,"Stayed four wonderful nights at Hotel 41 in December 2011.  My wife and daughter felt like British Royalty here.  The staff (especially Magdalena and Frederick) went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and welcome.  Probably the best service of any hotel we have stayed at in the world.  Far superior than some of the Peninsula, Waldorf or other Five Star Hotels we have been blessed to enjoy.  I booked the room based on reviews from Tripadvisor.  The price was very high and we thought that there would be no way any hotel is worth this kind of money. We were wrong.  Hotel 41 is worth the price.  Every employee knows your name here.  Every employee addresses you when they see you.  Every employee asks if your require any assistance.  From making restaurant reservations to…"
October 2023,A one-of-a-kind hotel,"This is one magnificent hotel. From the staff to the food/tea service to the gorgeous accommodations, this is the type of hotel you want to stay in when visiting London.  The entire staff was so lovely and they truly seemed happy in their jobs.  The bar, the dining room, the common areas...a really beautiful hotel.  I felt peace being there.  Do yourself a favor - if you're going to take a trip to London, do it right and stay somewhere you won't regret choosing...the memories I made the week I was there will last a lifetime.  "
November 2023,Step into the Magic! WOW,"My daughters Sweet 16th  Birthday. When we arrived by Taxi we greeted by Steve who addressed us by our family name and took care of all of our bags. Reception were so friendly and lovely immediately wishing my daughter a happy birthday. When we got to our rooms, there was a birthday card, banner, pink and white balloons, birthday cake and cookies. The personal touches were amazing! This is not 5 star service, it is something way beyond. Something very, very special. Our every need was met by charm and immediate action. While in London we got stuck due to protestors and so we walked to the Chesterfield mayfair  (Also a red carnation hotel) to ask for help for a taxi, they sat us down offered us water and called us a taxi to get to the Milestone. So very kind and an example that…"
November 2023,"Our favourite hotel in London, will be back soon.","Excellent service throughout the hotel, only ate breakfast at the hotel but that was outstanding, as were cocktails in the bar. Very clean hotel with a great history and spacious rooms. It was our daughter's 21st and the hotel provided a couple of nice treats as a surprise. Location is also perfect to get around London."
October 2023,Exceptional,"The Milestone is a cut above. Elegant and luxuriously beautiful, and yet also a heartily relaxing reprieve from the bustle of London. We stayed four nights in the Ruhlmann Suite. Most all of our needs and requests were deftly anticipated; those that weren’t were handled with speed and aplomb immediately on request. We have stayed at nearly 100 five+ star hotels around the world and The Milestone is among the best of our visits. We had an absolutely delightful stay, and when we return to London, we will certainly be back!"
October 2023,A London Gem,"The Milestone is an absolute gem.  Wonderfully located, ""grand"" (in the lower case sense of impressive but comfortable at the same time), and with a great staff.  Everyone from the doormen to the housekeeping staff, to the food and bar servers, to the front desk, made you feel at home, with your home as a London mansion.  We will definitely return, as often as possible!"
November 2023,A True 5 Star Experience ,"I was looking forward to my stay at the Milestone and was not disappointed.  A very warm welcome,  a beautiful room, and a great location is how I would sum up my stay. Breakfast was excellent, as were drinks in the Stables bar . Service was impeccable throughout our stay.  I normally like to try new hotels and restaurants whilst visiting Cities, but I doubt I will be straying too far from the Milestone when visiting London as it really is an excellent choice. "
October 2023,Husbands 50 th. ,The Milestone is so friendly welcoming and the staff couldn’t do enough for my family and I and my dog Meg !  We celebrated my husbands 50 th birthday and it was simply amazing.  What a lovely way to celebrate.  Many thanks Clare Tony and of course Meg !  Xx
October 2023,Truly 5 star experience,"My experience at the Milestone was every bit the 5 star experience I was hoping for. From the doorman's greeting and immediate attention on the way in to the doorman seeing us safely into our taxi on the way out (and quite literally every single member of staff I saw in between) everyone was warm and welcoming, helpful, cheerful, knowledgeable and just plain wonderful. Everything was clean. The food was fantastic. Attention to detail within the rooms and without. Stylish and classic combined. Truly a terrific stay! Highly recommended! Enjoy!"
October 2023,Top notch experience!,We enjoyed an incredible week at the Milestone. Their afternoon tea was amazing and quite filling and the room it is served in is really quite opulent. Our dinner there was probably some of the best food we’ve ever had in London… truly delicious. The bar is so much fun and very much like an exclusive private club. The staff was incredible…always there to help with our every need. We will be back to our new “home” in London very soon I hope!
October 2023,One of the best hotels that we have stayed in! Highly recommend!,"We had a fantastic stay at The Milestone! The highlight for us was the staff. They were very friendly, helpful, attentive and extremely well-trained. Nothing was too much trouble.  All areas of the hotel are luxurious and well cared for. Lovely touches in our room. We ate breakfast and afternoon tea at the hotel and both were delicious. Great location opposite Kensignton Gardens and less than a 10 minute walk to the tube station. Will definitely be making a return visit!"
July 2023,Very nice,"There really is only one thing keeping this from being the perfect hotel in London.  They need to bring back the buffet breakfast.  As it is breakfast is absurdly overpriced and takes forever.  That said, it's the only thing about the place which isn't incredibly well done.  The staff is friendly and attentive and the rooms/location were great.  Great location with a short walk to Whole Foods, the Swan pond in Kensington, not far from the tube, etc."
July 2023,MAGNIFICENT,At first we were a little uncomfortable with the fuss but we soon realised it was just plain impeccable service that is unmatched.  Being from Australia you hesitate with our dollar being times 2 but if you can afford it is worth every penny.  The rooms are thoughtful and so comfortable with the housekeepers being second to none with personal touches.  The highlight of our stay was the Stables Bar which has so much charisma and history and the cocktails are as good as I’ve had anywhere in the world.  Look forward to enjoying it even better next time. 
May 2023,The Milestone Hotel in the heart of London,"Outstanding hotel - location, service, and the full experience. Our room was very nice and comfortable. The staff was very polite and helpful. We hand our breakfast included in our package. We’ll  stay there again on our next visit. "
July 2023,What a Treat to Stay at the Milestone!!,"The Milestone was such a treat for our trip to London!  It's truly the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in.  The rooms are beautiful, the beds were so comfortable, the food is fabulous, and the service is the best I've ever had at a hotel.  The staff was so kind and accommodating.  We loved the treats they left for us during the turn down service and a few special treats as we attended Wimbledon and the staff made the experience really special.  The location was perfect as it's right across the street from Kensington Park.  If you have Tea in London, The Milestone is the place to have it.  It was such a treat in the beautifully designed restaurant.    We will definitely be back and I would recommend The Milestone for a vacation or a business trip.   It's the very best!!"
July 2023,Best hotel stay ever.,"The best hotel me and my wife has ever stopped in.  The staff were amazing the room was impeccably clean. The breakfast was fresh and well cooked We both couldn’t fault anything, which is a first for London. We would recommend this hotel without hesitation.  10 out of 10."
June 2023,The most lavishly beautiful welcome to London,"From the tiny copy of Jane Austen classics and mint chocolates on the bed at turn-down service, to the remarkable and unique dining experience at Cheneston's downstairs (try the pie!), this historic, elegant boutique will become a holiday hallmark. Located just a couple of minutes walk from High Street Kensington tube station, the suites are magnificent (we stayed in the The Noel Coward Suite and it had the most incredible bathroom!), and the staff are one of the friendliest, most hospitable bunch I have encountered (and I travel a lot! I was offered hand-written notes with recommended sights to visit and foods to try). If you're looking for a beautiful, luxury stay with all the English bells and whistles, this one is for you. We will return."
July 2023,Perfect,"Superb in every way . Food and drink and attention to detail was amongst the very best . Every member of staff made the effort and did it with a warmth and a level of engagement that I have rarely experienced elsewhere .  Beautiful building , beautifully furnished .  Couldn’t find a hole to pick even if I wanted to …… perfect"
July 2023,One of the best!,"The hotel staff and attention to detail exceeds expectations. This hotel was recommended by our travel agent and we had the best experience. The furnishings and decor are exquisite. From our wake up call followed immediately by our choice of coffees delivered to our room each morning,  truly a first class experience. The breakfast was delicious each morning in a beautifully appointed, intimate dining room. Truly one of the best hotels we’ve stayed at in our travels over the years."
June 2023,MILESTONE HOTEL - THE HOTEL THAT CARES!!!!!!!,"The bathroom was simply beautiful and our room was amazing thanks, we've never stayed in a hotel that goes so far out of its way to help you, nothing was ever too much trouble or too much of an inconvenience for the staff and I'm in a wheelchair.   When it came time for us to leave, we asked for taxi numbers but they had someone go outside and hail a cab for us.  WE FELT LIKE ROYALTY AND WERE TREATED AS IF WE REALLY ARE ROYALTY FOR OUR ENTIRE STAY!!!!!!!!!!  MILESTONE HOTEL 🏨 WE WILL DEFINITELY BE COMING BACK!!!!!!!"
June 2023,Great place to stay in London,"The Milestone Hotel experience was excellent for myself and my family. The staff was very attentive to our needs, and no request went unanswered.  Breakfast was an event every morning and we enjoyed it immensely. It began our day like the sunshine we experienced for our nine days we stayed there. My grandson loved the pool, the afternoon tea and the Stable bar with the delicious hot chocolate, served with his favorite cookies. He adored the doorman, Tim, whom gave him special attention. This hotel was one of the best I have ever stayed at and we enjoyed our time. "
May 2023,"Idyllic,  Intimate & Beautiful Hotel",We booked this hotel for our son & future daughter in law’s stay for the weekend of their wedding & I have to say that both the staff & the hotel were impeccable. The food was excellent & all the staff went out of their way to make us all feel so special.  Luxury in abundance.
May 2023,MISS,"This hotel was amazing , the staff were very attentive, friendly  and would help  you in any way they could without hesitation  The suite that we stayed in was out of this world, extremely clean, all your needs catered for and a very comfortable room  The small kindness of gifts on our pillow and in the room was exceptional and made our stay even more special,  with that personal touch The facilities were great and the meals in the hotel were outstanding We would definitely recommend this hotel, we could not fault it, and the location opposite Kensington park was perfect  We hope to visit again one day "
May 2023,A fabulous stay at the Milestone ,"Had a fantastic stay at the Milestone Hotel- I stayed for one night on the Sunday  when it was Coronation weekend, but wished I stayed more than that.  It's a beautiful hotel, and afyer checking in, I got shown round the hotel.  I was very impressed with the customer service - the little things like having a coffee delivered to your room after your wake-up call, tea, coffee facilities, box of biscuits, turn-down service - ensuring that you enjoy your stay.  I had dinner in the hotel (I had £70 credit for food and beverages) and used this for dinner - the chicken pie was delicious and the honeycomb ice cream was delicious too.  I really enjoyed my room which was a superior queen room.  I will definitely stay in thr hotel again."
May 2023,Best 5 Star Hotel Experience in the UK,"Exceptional experience in the best 5 star hotel i have stayed in (UK).  From the moment we were greeted at the door, handing over the car keys to have the car parked, to the moment the car was returned a couple of days later was a fantastic experience. The Welcoming was warm & professional.  The Room it self was over 2 floors.  Beautiful looking shower room.  The Bed was so big and comfortable.  The Wall to wall mirrors was a nice surprise bar a few windows.  Considering the location, it was so peaceful and quiet.  The TV quality was excellent.  A real bug bear of mine when you stay in nice hotels.  We had full access to SKY and BT. Sport.   The Breakfast was excellent.  I really couldnt fault the stay and would highly recommend to anyone considering in staying in a nice Hotel…"
April 2023,Amazing Place and People!,"This is a grand old hotel.  Frome the first day we walked in, it felt friendly.  Everyone was friendly and fun. Steve (the Doorman), Steve (concierge), Dino, Renato, Tim (the Doorman), Grant, Fran, and Claire were some of the funnest. The afternoon tea was grand, and their signature sandwich was very tasty.  Compliments to the Chef.  This is one of the places that we will try to come back to."
April 2023,Our best experience in years,"The service was so good that now we have been spoilt and will find it hard to like any other Hotel. Everyone was super pleasant and warm. It felt like we were staying with family (the good ones). The whole experience was top notch. Be it the rooms, the afternoon tea, the Bar and the dining. We absolutely will be going back again "
April 2023,Cant wait to go back!,From start to finish our experience was first class!   The staff could not do enough to ensure your stay was memorable 10/10 we will definitely be back.  Location was also very good with great transport links.
April 2023,Great Experience and Service,I had a wonderful experience at The Milestone Hotel and Residences at my first trip to London. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel is very clean. I also had a nice experience dinning in. It is near a train station and one of the Royal gardens. I would definitely recommend to stay at The Milestone Hotel. 
April 2023,One of the best in London,"Absolutely nothing negative to say about this property. Great friendly and attentive staff, fantastic breakfast menu, amazing location. Comfortable and quiet rooms. We were in the King deluxe room for 5 nights which offered daily bottled water, turn down service and a welcome gift . Would highly recommend this hotel "
April 2023,Our 2nd home in London,"We consider this Hotel our 2nd home when we come to London, since all services provided have always been excellent.  The staff are always helpful and friendly ready with a smile and have an eye for detail.  "
April 2023,Top shelf hotel,"We have traveled to London many times and this was absolutely the nicest hotel we have ever stayed at there.  From the moment we were greeted at the front door, given a tour and shown to our rooms the service was outstanding.  The hotel is beautiful and historic with a fabulous bar.  Located in the Kensington neighborhood meant an easy walk to so many good restaurants and easy access to the tube.  We were sorry to leave and look forward to our next visit there."
April 2023,Milestone experience,"The Milestone is a beautiful, small hotel that is conveniently located in London and has superb service, including an outstanding restaurant. Afternoon tea with grandchildren was delightful. We strongly recommend this hotel!"
April 2023,An excellent hotel,"Our stay here was excellent.  From the moment we arrived, the staff were welcoming, knowledgeable and helpful with our questions and needs.  We will stay here each time we are in London.  One evening, we were planning to walk to a recommended restaurant.  We asked about directions and the concierge walked with us to the restaurant.  This is a beautiful, well-run, comfortable hotel.  We highly recommend it."
February 2023,Not worth the money,The reviews of this hotel sounded amazing! We thought we would treat ourselves at the end of our Europe trip and book this hotel for three nights.  We got to our room and it was tiny! Wayyyy too much furniture for a hotel room! Definitely not needed. We had no room to open our suitcases. There was no view and it only had a double bed. We asked to be upgraded to a bigger room which swiftly happened. The next room had a much bigger bed and view of the park. (Still too much chunky furniture and no room for luggage) We could have stayed at a major hotel chain with bigger and better facilities for a much cheaper price. Upon checking out the bill said it charged 15 pounds a day for tips! We asked for this to be removed.  There is no coffee machine in the rooms  No mini bar  Not worth…
January 2023,Great hotel with friendly staff,"Have been to the Milestone many times. Returned once again in January 2023 and we had, again, a lovely experience. Great service, lovely friendly staff, charming view from our lovely room with all mod cons. Lovely breakfast room, great location. Will be back. "
April 2023,Almost Speechless,"My stay here at the Milestone was above and beyond anything I could have dreamed of. I'm almost left speechless at how wonderfully we were treated and how incredible the accommodations were. The building itself is impeccably decorated and transports you back to Victorian era London. The breakfasts were divine- smoked salmon eggs benedict every day please! The location was perfect, just across from Kensington Palace and beautiful Hyde Park. I can't recommend this hotel enough, and I'm already planning my next stay there! And a special thank you to Andrew and all of the other staff that helped make my trip a dream come true<3"
April 2023,A perfect Milestone stay,"From the moment we were greeted at the door, we knew The Milestone would be our home away from home. The impeccable staff made us feel so welcome, and the service provided was always extended with warmth and a smile. Hotel staff is a reflection of management, and this carefully curated crew takes their cue from the delightful and charming GM, Andrew Pike.   The rooms were inviting, with wonderful beds, antiques throughout, beautifully appointed marble bathrooms, and every amenity one could want.  If morning tea or coffee is your thing, just ask, and a huge box containing cups, kettle, a French press, and drinks will be provided. The lounge, restaurant, and bar make you feel like you’re in an English manor house, and the servers are happy to chat with you about sightseeing, or…"
March 2023,Loved this hotel!,"Recently stayed at this beautiful hotel in the heart of Kensington...location and condition of the property were amazing, but it was really the staff that took the experience to another level. Truly everyone was helpful; however, there were a few team members who stood out including Renato, Steve, Tim, Angelo and Victoria. Next trip to London will definitely include a stay at this wonderful hotel."
April 2023,Amazing Wedding reception!!,"My husband and I had our wedding reception at the Milestone. The service and food was impeccable and the staff were just fantastic. Right from the attention to detail  and all the help they provided, could not fault them at all. The events coordinator, Emma was fantastic and so so helpful with the planning and organisation of the day. We were on a tight budget, where a lot of other venues we looked at were so inflexible with certain things and made us feel like we had to pay and arm and a leg, the Milestone worked within our budget (within reason of course) to help us achieve what we wanted on the day.  Really felt like they went above and beyond to make our day that extra special.  Highly recommend them for small parties, weddings and events!!"
April 2023,My 3rd time staying here and it is like a second home. Just a great place to stay.,"This is my 3rd stay at this hotel. That is because  I really like staying at the Milestone. Whenever we've been out for a full day in London, coming back to the hotel is very comfortable and relaxing. Getting a drink from Lilo in the bar is something I look forward to every day I am there. The staff at the hotel are all very welcoming and friendly, and the location is  good with nice rooms with views over Kensington Gardens. The breakfast room is very cozy, and the bedrooms are all really quite nice. They run a great operation.   "
June 2023,Best hotel in London,"A pretty well located Hotel with all the english flavor! As soon as you wake up you can take a stroll in hyde park, or look for an event to attend at the Royal Albert Hall which is just a 5 minutes  walk from the Milestone All the staff is very amicable and helfull. "
June 2023,Exceptional Boutique Hotel Opposite Kensington Gardens,"The Milestone is an excellent boutique hotel in the heart of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea just opposite Kensington Gardens with the most delightful and guest oriented staff, beautiful and thoughtful guest rooms and bathrooms. Walkable to great attractions, shops, and dining. Would come back in a heartbeat!! "
June 2023,Fabulous Staff,"We are regular to London and have stayed in some fab places but the staff here in this boutique hotel make your stay so memorable and worthwhile you wouldn’t want to stay anywhere else, everyone you meet is just so helpful and kind, the service is impeccable, thank you for having us recently for an overnight stay, from the doorman Tim, the pleasant concierge team, the reception staff, the restaurant team, the bar tender and lovely waitress’ just everyone including housekeeping are just so kind, we loved everything about it apart from the size of our bed but I guess this comes with the booking of the room,  booking.com where cheaper than booking direct which we much prefer to do but it’s worth calling the hotel directly to book in, we will be back …"
June 2023,Best hotel in London,"My wife and I stayed for 1 night at this fabulous hotel to celebrate my birthday. What a treat it was! Everything was perfect, lovely room, lovely bathroom with the BEST shower and bathroom products, the most delicious breakfast and most of all the incredible staff. Everyone made us feel so welcome and valued. Nothing was too much trouble and all done with the perfect balance of friendliness and professionalism. It’s not the cheapest place you’ll ever stay at but I urge you to make an occasion of it and book a night there; hang the expense and enjoy it!! We will definitely be back."
May 2023,British Luxury,Enjoyed our four day stay here. The Hotel offers a convenient location with impeccable service. The afternoon tea service was wonderful. The English Breakfast served daily was delicious. The evening turndown service was the highlight.
May 2023,Exceptional Service and Support at the Milestone Hotel in London!,"We had a lovely stay at this wonderful boutique hotel in the Kensington area of London. We appreciated the fine service and support from the stellar staff at the Milestone.  Location was ideal and breakfast was divine!  We also enjoyed tea in their sunroom, drinks in their famous bar and fine dining in their restaurant.  This was certainly a trip and vacation to remember made all the better by truly exceptional people working at the Milestone including Grant, Beliz, Renato, Joe, Dino, Mohammed and Mansour.  Thank you."
June 2023,Trip to London,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Milestone hotel, and I felt compelled to express my utmost appreciation for the outstanding hospitality and remarkable experience your esteemed establishment provided"
June 2023,A fantastic stay!,"My family and I just had such a magnificent time at the hotel!  The staff could not have been nicer nor more accommodating.  When we needed space for an after concert party, Leo and his staff even made special arrangements for us.  Our boys, 5 and 9, were left little presents.  The breakfast was amazing.  Our only regret was that our stay was so short."
May 2023,A little happyness in London,"The Milestone Hotel is a red and white brick building opposite Kensington Park and is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in. Location it’s a stone’s throw from the park and palace, Royal Albert Hall and Harrods. Our arrival by taxi from Paddington caused a minor commotion as the driver wanted cash as his card machine wasn’t working.  The doorman and reception charged the £22 fare to our room and paid the cabbie. Reception accompanied us to our first floor room and explained how everything worked and the 24hr Stable Bar – think Cheers – provided sustenance for the weary travellers who had forgotten how horrendous London traffic can be – queues were blamed on the new cycle lanes. The chocolates left on the pillows at turndown melted a little bit but housekeeping changed…"
May 2023,Fabulous hotel!,We came to stay the night before my daughter’s wedding and were treated superbly. We were given a room upgrade which was lovely and nothing was too much trouble. The staff were extremely attentive and the hotel itself was beautiful and luxurious!
January 2023,Favorite Hotel in London!,"The first thing you’ll notice upon arriving at this beautiful hotel is the excellent service and generous staff. We were fortunate enough to stay at The Milestone Hotel for the first half of our honeymoon trip and truly enjoyed our stay. Our room was quiet and quaint, and we had a beautiful view facing Kensington Gardens. The staff also helped us celebrate the occasion by gifting us flowers and other surprises. It was a wonderful and unique experience.   We thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast services & morning teas at The Milestone and always looked forward to a nightcap in the beautiful parlor and bar. The staff was so kind and friendly - and it was a pleasure getting to know everyone. On top of everything, it served as the most perfect location for all of our daytime activities…"
February 2023,Best hotel in London,"The first thing you'll notice on arriving is that the service is uniformly excellent - warm, helpful and thoughtful. The hotel itself is also beautiful, with clear attention to detail throughout. The rooms are wonderful and all have their own distinct character; the food is great; and no visit is complete without going to the fabulous Stables bar, which has a truly imaginative drinks list curated by award-winning bartenders! I would never stay anywhere else in London."
January 2023,friendly and beautiful Hotel.,The hotel was beautiful and the area where it was situated was perfect - just a short walk to the Royal Albert Hall.  The rooms were so quaint and beautifully decorated.  The bed was comfortable and very cosy. The service was wonderful from reception to turn down staff.  Everyone was so friendly and pleasant and let us know where everything was.  Breakfast was beautiful with a good range of different options on the menu.
January 2023,Outstanding London vacation,"From the moment the bellman welcomed us by name to the moment we were wished a safe trip home, the experience of staying at The Milestone was simply an awesome experience.  Words can not clearly explain the feeling of hospitality each and every member of Mr. Pike's staff extends to their guests. We have stayed in many beautiful hotels in London and around the world. The Milestone is at the top of our list - we have already made plans for next post-Christmas holiday. The residence we stayed in was perfect for our family- it was a joy to sit in the living room with the fireplace going while we enjoyed room service and a delicious pot of tea. You truly want to stay there all day. The front desk was most hospitable. I can not thank all of the concierges for their courteous and…"
January 2023,Another Trip To London,"The Milestone is like going to a families house. This was our second time staying here & of course the service is 5 star and above. The staff was outstanding I surprised my wife with flying my daughter and son in law over for here birthday and the staff was great at helping me plan it and keep it a secret. A couple people I would like to give a shout out to. Joe from concierge, Tom the first office manger, the ladies and gentleman in the dinner room and the ladies at the front desk where all superb. This hotel maintains a level of British hospitality that is hard to beat. Until next time!"
January 2023,Why Go Anywhere Else?,"We have stayed at the Milestone Hotel numerous times but this was our first stay post-COVID.  I was concerned that the Milestone's standards of elegance and first class service would have suffered since the pandemic.  But to my delight, the hotel remains the same wonderful hotel that I remembered!  The staff is only too eager to assist with any plans--even before arrival.  Dino, the concierge, made our dinner reservations for us a week before our arrival!  Grant, the server/manager of the breakfast rooms, got us off to a terrific start with hearty breakfasts and sound advice.  Spencer and Steven made sure we had plenty of bottled water and taxis to drive us around.  There are many hotel choices in London, but why not stay in a truly British hotel with impeccable service and…"
January 2023,BEST BIRTHDAY TEA EVER!,"A couple weeks ago I was visiting London for my 40th birthday with over 20 women from the States. I contacted the Milestone and several other venues to see who could accommodate our group for a High Tea. Not only was the Milestone the most communicative and not price prohibitive, but their facilities looked amazing from the pictures; so it was an easy choice to make.   Then over the months leading up to the event, the staff was so helpful and kind, I was confident I make the right choice. From flowers to dietary restrictions, they were able to handle everything! (They even found nondairy butter for one of my friends who has a severe dairy allergy).   The day of the Tea the staff was extremely professional, friendly, and helpful. Every single woman in attendance raved and…"
January 2023,Better than Home away from Home,"When our 9 and 11 year old heard we were going to London for a quick trip they asked if we were staying at ""the amazing hotel that brought us cookies and tea"". You can't help but fall in love with the Milestone Hotel. From the minute the door opens with the warmest greeting and that those in the Hotel are truly happy to see and help you. We travel a lot and I can assure you this a rare thing for hotels these days. The effort and care is consistent with every stay (and we keep going back) and each person we come across. Andrew Pike and his Team are truly special, thank you for always ensuring we leave happy and excited for the next visit."
January 2023,Lovely London Stay,"The level of attention and care was second to none.  Each staff member was engaging and thoughtful- they knew our names.  The rooms were spacious, VERY clean.  Location was perfect!  Close to museums, parks, shopping, the Tube…  We were pampered, and made to feel as if we were special guests.  "
January 2023,Our new favourite London Hotel!,"We have officially found my new favourite London hotel! The Milestone in Kensington.  After much searching online and wanting to discover a different place from our two other (now former!) favourite London hotels, I came across this incredible find. I booked a beautiful king deluxe room for 3 nights to celebrate my husband's birthday as it looked traditional, cosy, classy, had all the facilities we wanted and most of all, it looked special. It did not disappoint! From the point of booking and discussing details over the phone with the booking team to the clear and friendly email communication prior to our visit, it left me excited in the lead up to our stay!  From the warm and welcoming arrival, the beautiful exterior of the building and history of the hotel we walked in with a…"
February 2023,"More than amazing, words can’t explain","Amazing amazing amazing!!!!! Me and my fiancé booked for one night for our anniversary and… well!! i’ve never enjoyed myself more!!!!! When we entered we were introduced with lovely staff with smiles (Heather at reception and Zen who gave us a building tour and entry). The hotel had upgraded us (for free!!) from a standard room to the Mistinguett Suite (!) and it was more than beautiful- the room was lush with a balcony, in hotel fresh homemade cookies and tea. They also gave us a free cocktail each upon entry (both of which that aren’t on their bar cocktail menu).   My fiancé had left a booking note that it was for our anniversary and when we arrived after our meal our room had been tidied and been set up with chocolates on the pillows with rose petals, candles too, and a plate…"
January 2023,Our wedding at the Milestone Hotel,"In January this year we got married at the Milestone Hotel, and let me tell you, It was the best decision we've made!  The ceremony, reception, dinner and the party were all held at the hotel and we cannot complain about one thing. Everything was well organised, food was delicious, staff was incredibly attentive and our wedding suite was just stunning.   Emma, our Banqueting Executive, was in constant communication with us throughout the whole process, making sure that everything was organised as we requested, and nothing was a problem for her. She really tried to accommodate every request we had.  So, If you are looking for a small wedding venue, combined with british luxury, this is it. Don't look no further!  "
March 2023,Amazing!,"Amazing service and accommodations.   Super location, within walking distance to some really good restaurants.  Didn’t dine in much except for Breakfast - but that menu is outstanding. Concierge & Staff go above and beyond expectations. 5-Star hotel all the way."
April 2023,Great stay in early April,"Beautiful spaces in this hotel. Moderate sized well appointed room  Exceptional service staff Exceptional meals Easy access to bus, underground within a few blocks. Cross the street to Kensington Park and Palace The fitness room is bright and well appointed with jacuzzi/ pool room attached. Sauna  Highly recommended hotel- we will stay again!"
April 2023,Luxe in London,"What an absolutely wonderful hotel. Everything was perfect. The hotel is spotless with the ideal blend of historic charm and luxe, modern decor and amenities. My daughter and I were treated with such kindness. We had high tea which was fabulous and decided to upgrade to a room with a view of the park. Truly incredible. The hotel is perfectly located near the UnderGround…we were able to get everywhere with ease. There is a Santander bike spot 2 blocks away so we were able to rent 2 bikes and cycle Hyde Park…a highlight of our trip. The Milestone is a true 5-star hotel. I can’t imagine a better way to experience London."
February 2023,"Luxurious in many respects, but missing the RCH personal touch","My wife and I had a 3 night stay at The Milestone recently, at a rate of £430 per night for bed and breakfast. The Red Carnation brand is familiar to us, having stayed 15 times in 6 properties from their portfolio previously. The brand gives us a number of things that we require as guests in a hotel, including luxurious surroundings, a peaceful night’s sleep on a quality mattress and bedding, good food and wine, but perhaps most important of all – quality, personal service. All this doesn’t come cheap as rates usually start at around £250 in all hotels in the portfolio. The brand has also started adding an ‘optional’ service charge per night recently.  Having stayed at Summer Lodge in Dorset during August 2022, we decided to give The Milestone a try for the first time since the…"
March 2023,An AMAZING afternoon Tea experience!!,"A wonderful Afternoon Tea! The staff were helpful, friendly and went above and beyond to ensure we had all we needed/wanted. A great time was thoroughly enjoyed and the beautiful settings of the hotel made it a luxurious event celebrating my mums upcoming birthday. The Afternoon tea was fresh, scrumptious and the best I’ve had in London yet! I would recommend anyone to try it and I look forward to returning to try out some more of their food menu. Thank you Milestone Staff x "
April 2023,Beautiful Afternoon Tea - Fantastic service,Beautiful afternoon tea at the Milestone hotel yesterday. The highlights for my was the delicious chicken sandwich rolled in almonds and the black sesame seed macaroon - but in all honesty the whole offering was great and there was an abundance of food. The service we received was great and nothing was too much for them. 
March 2023,Wonderful experience,"Our recent stay at Milestone hotel and residences was excellent. Hotel staff including front desk, house keeping were outstanding . The service was very attentive, we especially appreciated the thoughtfulness of the Front desk, concierge and restaurant service staff who arranged for our breakfast and coffee in “to go” containers when we were running late for a day trip. We look forward to staying at Milestone residences again in future. "
March 2023,Best hotel,"Pleased with my visit to this hotel. The staff was very friendly, efficient, helpful. They greeted me every time, help find transportation and provided good places to visit. The room was fantastic, they kept it clean. The tea experience was wonderful."
December 2022,Still the best ,"Second time here. Last time, six years ago, was so great that I was ready to be disappointed. I was NOT. This is really a fantastic hotel. We stayed in a suite and a double room this time and although I have stayed in places with more luxurious design and better functions in details, the staff is what really lifts this hotel to master class! They all seem to genuinely like their jobs and that transmits to a friendly, correct and personal service, from Steve the doorman wishing us welcome back home after a walk, to almost everybody knowing our name to the great breakfast staff taking care of every wish with a  smile and a nice comment. We also had quite a lot of need of help from the concierge to arrange an activity with nanny for one of my daughters which they solved 100%.   I…"
December 2022,Magical vacation,"One of the best hotel I have ever been to. Great service and everything is so clean, good food and a wonderful atmosphere. This is a unique experience for London highly recommended don’t miss the beauty and luxurious place! We’re having a wonderful vacation because of this experience"
November 2022,Fabulous Hotel,"OMG, what a great hotel!!!  It was formerly a mansion & is very warm & inviting.  We were there to check in early & room was not quite ready so had complimentary drinks in their magnificent bar.   So beautifully English traditional.  We made reservations for formal tea the first afternoon.  The room was gorgeous with a fireplace, heavy draperies, beautiful fabrics.  The service, champagne, scones etc were wonderful.  Great location across from Kensington Palace.   Close to Royal Albert Hall, Natural History, Victoria & Albert Museum.  We walked to Harrods.  Staff made reservations for us when needed.  We had a yummy dinner in our room one night & tea service twice.  Our room had a couch & two chairs & a large luxurious bathroom & again beautiful fabrics.  We stayed at the #1…"
November 2022,Comfortable and homely with a real touch of luxury,We were made to feel really welcome at every turn. The service was exceptional (as were the cocktails). The room was spacious and spotless and the bed was like sleeping on a cloud. Every staff member we came across were friendly and accommodating and went out of their way to make our staff very special. We can't wait to come back.
November 2022,"A special place to celebrate a ""milestone"" birthday","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Milestone Hotel. The staff made us feel so welcome and special. Our rooms were beautiful, comfortable and had everything we needed. A highlight for us was our full English breakfast in the charming dining room. Special thanks to the friendly doorman, who always gave us the best advice on how to get around in London. We would love a return visit someday!"
November 2022,Amazing Afternoon Tea,"I used to live just around the corner from The Milestone. The first thing you notice is how nice it looks from the outside. I went here with a friend of mine for afternoon tea and we weren't disappointed. The room where we were served was elegant yet very cosy and inviting. It has a very relaxed atmosphere and the staff were attentive and polite. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who planned to go shopping around the Kensington area and wanted to finish off with a wonderful afternoon tea and amazing surroundings. It was quiet on the day we went, and I'm wondering if it's always like that - so nice to find a quieter place to enjoy good food when you've spent the day in bustling London. Definitely recommend!"
November 2022,Fabulous hotel and staff,"Amazing hotel and staff .. everyone was so lovely. Couldn’t fault It from start to finish. Clean, beautiful and had everything we required for are stay in London  We will definitely be back and will recommend it to friends and family. Very good location."
November 2022,An Absolute London Delight,"Wonderfully charming cozy English hotel with a staff that is thoroughly helpful, friendly, and professional in every way.  Luxurious, not in grandeur, nor opulence (although the hotel is beautifully finished) but in gracious, sincere hospitality where you are charmed and delighted to be here at the start and end of everyday.   I can think of very few hotels in the world,  where my wife and I share these words every time we check in “it’s good to be back”."
June 2022,A true home away from home,"What can I say about this hotel when everything is perfection. The staff become family and take care of their guests with utmost care and professionalism. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed. Howe keeping does a wonderful job, turn down service is a joy to come back to. We enjoyed breakfast daily, had a great afternoon experience and dinner on a couple of evenings I will not stay anywhere else when I visit London"
November 2022,Charming Hotel and Staff,"We love staying at The Milestone when we're in London.  The entire staff is charming and so kind.  When they say, ""Welcome Home!"" when you return each day, it's just the nicest thing because they seem so sincere.  Every interaction we had from the front desk staff, bartenders, concierge and cleaning staff was exceptional.  The hotel is across the street from Kensington Park and close to all sorts of shopping and restaurants--there's not a better location in all of London.  We love everything about this property and can't wait to return."
September 2022,The best location and service in London!,"The Milestone is a beautiful boutique hotel steps away from Hyde Park, Kensington Palace and a beautiful stroll to Buckingham Palace and a convenient Underground station. But you will want to spend as much time as possible in the Milestone itself. The rooms are decorated with lush fabrics and have incredible bathrooms. The Stable's Bar, The Park lounge and Cheneston's are all superbly decorated and serve delicious and creative drinks and food. The best part of your stay will be meeting and talking with the staff that are helpful and attentive."
November 2022,A hidden gem!,"This hotel was recommended by a friend who had described it as a hidden gem.  He was absolutely correct! it's a terrific location with great staff, everyone was welcoming and super helpful and engaging.  My room (106) was gorgeous, beautifully appointed with lots of lovely features. The stables Bar is very reminiscent of Ralph Lauren, cosy and intimate staffed by a super team who could not do enough for me. All in all a brilliant recommendation!"
November 2022,A wonderful stay at The Milestone,"An absolutely fantastic stay at The Milestone! The hotel itself was beautiful and there was very clear attention given to each and every detail. The room was spacious and very comfortable. I would have to say my favorite space in the hotel was the conservatory, decorated beautifully and you can’t beat the natural light.   I will say what really set the hotel apart was the staff. Every person I came into contact with was exceptionally and went out of their way to be helpful. It really was a huge value add and made me feel right at home."
November 2022,Hidden Gem,"Classic, boutique hotel with an old world charm and attention to detail that I a hidden gem in London. Superb location right by Hyde Park and the shopping district in Kensington Highstreet. Delicious highteas. The perfect gift for a birthday. Highly recommend as a getaway."
October 2022,Quintessential English Hotel,"The quintessential traditional London experience.   We had a superar stay.  The staff are excellent throughout the property:   Reception, Concierge, Housekeeping, Bar and Restaurant staff were all friendly, attentive and professional.  We continued our trip at two other properties and the difference in service was considerable.  The property itself is well appointed and well kept, providing a fantastic view to traditional London hotel quarters.  This time we opted for a suite and stayed at the Venetian Suite.  Very posh, spacious, comfortable, and traditional with modern high quality amenities.  High Tea, drinks and food were also a 10 out of 10.  The only downside to staying at the Milestone is eventually checking out and leaving.  A memorable stay."
October 2022,"Genteel, luxurious hotel in a great location","The Milestone is a lovely, Victorian-style hotel that goes above and beyond to serve its guests. There is an abundance of staff ready to fulfill every whim. The beds are comfortable, and the food is good. That said, our bedroom was a little small and the bathroom a little large. The bathroom was  1/3 the size of the bedroom."
October 2022,Exceeded my expectation!,"My room was upgraded - I had an amazing view to the Kensington Gardens. I was welcomed with a glass of champagne, provided with a bath salt, and sent a box of house made biscuits (best ever biscuits in my life). The service was beyond great! THe personnel is exceptional!"
October 2022,Great Service & Attention to Detail,We had an awesome stay at The Milestone. I've worked in hospitality all my life and the staff there was fantastic. I wish I could remember everyone's name but Zen at the Front Desk and Grant in the Restaurant were awesome; above and beyond. The Housekeeping crew were great too. Truly a 5 star experience!!
October 2022,A night to remember!!,"We stayed at The Milestone and from the start the service was fantastic, car porters ready and waiting for us, staff to take out luggage, all well dressed and extremely polite.   This was also the night we got engaged outside the Royal Albert. I spoke with staff a few days before and mentioned I planned on proposing, without hesitation they put a plan into place and while we were out that evening they covered the room with rose petals and chocolates, also champagne!   I couldn’t recommend the hotel anymore highly, everything was brilliant and without fault, we are even looking to book our next stay. "
October 2022,An exceptional hotel in a perfect location.,"The Milestone is truly outstanding in every respect.  The rooms are spacious, comfortable and well-maintained.  The atmosphere is warm, welcoming and highly  responsive to the needs of each guest.  All of the staff are polite, friendly and professional.  We travel frequently but the Milestone is our all-time favorite place to stay."
October 2022,Wonderful hotel and staff!,"My husband and I had the best time staying at the Milestone! We were so warmly welcomed and treated like royalty. The staff helped us in any way they could and the service was fantastic! The hotel was warm, comfortable and beautiful! Just what we were looking for!"
October 2022,Impeccable,"This is a true gem of a boutique hotel. You will not find friendlier or more attentive staff in London. The rooms are lovely and the location is perfect for parks, palaces and the best museums. I have stayed in many London hotels and this one feels like staying with (very well appointed) friends. I can't recommend highly enough."
October 2022,Great Boutique Hotel,The service was impeccable. The staff was excellent. The hotel’s attention to detail made the stay enjoyable.  The daily breakfast was included. The bartender made tasty drinks.  The whole feel of The Milestone was warm and cozy.  I would highly recommend this hotel. It was wonderful!
June 2022,Once in life time trip,"We travelled from Australia to the UK - London. First time ever in London after over 60 trips around the Sun, so we wanted an experience, to stay somewhere special and in a great location - The Milestone Hotel ticked those all the boxes and more. Located just minutes from Kensington Palace (SW corner of Kensington Gardens) Close to underground, bus stop almost at door step. And of course Royal Albert Hall just down the road.  Living in such a modern World - staying at the Milestone Hotel was like almost taking a step back in time. The day core was right out of the 1910' or 20's (I think). The service was also straight out from that time.  We felt like we were living as part of Downton Abbey. All the staff from the doormen, to the General Manager (Andrew); the service desk to the…"
October 2022,A true gem,"I loved my experience with Milestone hotel, from the moment I checked in. The staff was friendly and welcoming.  Enjoyed a welcoming drink prior to arrival, got upgraded to a spacious suite with great amenities.  Great dinner experience with cozy Cheneston's as well, where food was delicious and well presented. Enjoyed a drink in the intimate Stables bar during my stay. I would definitely recommend trying their old fashioned! Breakfast at the Park lounge was great, with their cozy and warm sofas and chairs, overlooking the Royal Kensington Gardens.  Very classy hotel with an old English charm, would definitely come back!"
September 2022,Milestone Hotel is a perfect home away from home,"We love this Hotel, always a great welcome and friendly service. From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave anything you want is no problem for the staff.  The evening meals are excellent. My wife is on a low salt diet, and this was achieved without any fuss, yet she still had flavour in the meals, which is not achieved at most restaurants.  Beautiful wines at reasonable prices.  The servicing of our room was excellent, and discreet.  Looking forward to our next visit."
September 2022,Home away from home!,"My wife and I had the most exceptional stay at the Milestone!  Every detail was taken into consideration and the staff truly go out of their way to make you feel like a welcome and honored guest.  The experience is the best of both worlds--lush and luxurious, yet cozy and full of personal touches.    Situated directly across from Kensington Gardens, the location is peaceful and charming, yet just a short walk from the vibrant shopping district of High Street Kensington and access to both District and Circle underground lines.    Could not recommend more highly!"
October 2022,Honeymoon in London,My husband and I absolutely loved our four night stay at Milestone Hotel. The staff really went above and beyond to make sure our stay was wonderful. We had delicious breakfast every morning and enjoyed dinner and afternoon tea. The front desk and concierge associates were friendly and helpful accommodating our jet lagged sleep schedule. Would recommend staying here again.
September 2022,Great hotel,"Great customer service, facilities and bar. The rooms are very well appointed and comfortable.  Despite being in central London the noise is minimal from nearby roads. The staff go the extra mile and are very helpful. The pool, restaurant and bar are great and would definitely stay again."
August 2022,Beautiful hotel with exceptional service,"The Milestone hotel was my home during Notting Hill Carnival 2022. I‘m glad I found this small jewel, which is as luxurious as it is cozy. My room was very beautiful, clean and tidy. The daily cleaning was very attentive and thorough. The interior is stylish and beautiful The 24/7 room service with delicous dishes saved me sometimes when I got back hungry. Next time I hope to explore more of the culinary possibilities as they look promising, but during Carnival I was often just exhausted when returning or too late. The Spa is basic. There is a Finnish sauna and a pool with a counter-current system. It‘s definitely not a wellness hotel, but completely ok to relax a bit. Thanks to the exceptional service, they managed to organise a wonderful sports massage on a Sunday at very…"
August 2022,Afternoon Tea,We had a lovely Afternoon Tea at the Milestone on our London visit. The staff were extremely kind and accommodating. The property was charming. The tea service was excellent. The food and presentation were excellent. We were served by Tatiana who took good care of us and kept us entertained as well.
July 2022,THE Best Boutique Hotel in London Bar None!,"The Milestone Hotel, in London's Kensington neighborhood, is exceptional in so many ways, and at the very top of the long list is their customer service. Every member of their staff loves their job and their colleagues, which translates into an environment that feels like an extended family is welcoming you into their luxurious, mini palace, and their one-and-only priority is for you to have a perfect holiday experience.  The concierge staff is particularly gifted at their craft, and the location, just opposite Kensington Palace & Gardens, is perfect. An oasis of luxury wrapped in the warmth, kindness, and gratitude of a close-knit, happy family. Book your stay early. Both The Milestone Hotel, in Kensington, and its sister hotel The Egerton House, in Knightsbridge, were fully…"
July 2022,Home away from home,"From the moment my husband and I stepped into the lobby, we were made feel welcome and at home. The receptionist showed us around, made sure to introduce us to the wait staff in the restaurant and in the bar, all of whom welcomed us by name when we came back. The attention to detail throughout the property (restaurant, bar and the room) were unparalleled - and we can hardly wait to come back for a longer stay."
November 2021,We splurged and spent two nights here,We really enjoyed this hotel. We could afford it because COVID had lowered prices at the time. Staff was wonderful. Just a beautiful hotel. The only downside was that it wasn't particularly close to anything except the Kensington Gardens. But that's a small issue. We are really glad we stayed here.
July 2022,An oasis of luxurious calm!,"A truly excellent hotel offering an oasis of luxurious calm in the centre of London. Situated opposite Kensington gardens and less than half a mile from Albert Hall, the Milestone offers everything one could reasonably expect from a great hotel. Attentive and helpful staff, great rooms, leisure facilities, fine restaurants and a cosy bar. Marvellous!"
July 2022,You will feel special!,"An amazing boutique hotel. You will feel special and appreciated. Loved the open bar area and the breakfast. The rooms were cozy, patted, with a bidet. They have a nice rain shower. Close to everything. A cool night club in front. This is my place to stay in London."
July 2022,Stunning,"The hotel is beautiful and has a boutique feel to it. The decor and appointment of our room was amazing, we loved the little touches like the fabric walls and individually decorated room. The staff are extremely attentive and friendly, they literally could not do enough for you. The complimentary drink upon arrival was unexpected but gratefully received after five hours of travelling. The attention to detail was beyond anything I have experienced anywhere and I travel quite a bit, the one thing that I loved was the ice cube in Las Dos Fridas drink- simple but so classy."
July 2022,"If you like to be treated as royalty, you should stay here.....","My wife and I travel a lot for pleasure and always try to stay in nice hotels.  This was our second visit to the Milestone and it was every bit as good as the first visit, if not better.  The staff go out of their way to make your stay as enjoyable as possible.  Everyone from the doormen to the food and beverage staff, to the housekeeping staff did a wonderful job of making our stay unforgettable.  The concierge staff is beyond compare as they worked tirelessly to help us with the events and activities that we wanted to enjoy while in London.  The Milestone will always be my first choice of hotels to stay at when in London, and if you enjoy being pampered and made to feel like royalty, you will stay here as well."
July 2022,Exceptional In Every Way,"My daughter and I had been to tea at the Milestone a few times and loved it in the past, so when planning our July 2022 visit we decided to book our week long stay there. The hotel and staff greatly exceeded our expectations. We booked a Deluxe King/Twin and stayed in room 103 - extremely quiet, interior view. A front desk staff gave us a quick hotel tour and escorted us to our room and acquainted us with its features and offered us a welcome beverage - room service also delivered a mini welcome cake and biscuits with our champagne. The bathroom was well lit, had ample towels and built in nightlight - great water pressure in shower/bath. Bed linens were luxurious -  housekeeping visited twice a day -  we enjoyed turn down service  and the lit candle in the bathroom. Two robes…"
July 2022,This hotel and staff should not be missed!,"From getting out of the cab... to making our way to reception... to a brief and useful 'tour' ... to our being taken to our room. and on and on... EVERY PERSON was professional, personable, capable and attentive. We've stayed all over the world at top hotels and this is one we'd return to when we return to London. EVERY aspect was A+++."
March 2022,The Milestone is a Gem,"It was like stepping into a storybook as we enjoyed our time in the delightfully classic Milestone Hotel.  The rooms, the lobby, the amazing staff, High Tea .. all was amazing .. My wife kept calling it the “Mary Poppins” hotel. I cannot recommend it more - they  even arranged for us to get our Covid-19 pre-departure test for our flight home.  The Doorman was a delight (Steven) and Fran the concierge .. all of them .. top rate .. there for you to make your stay amazing.   When you are in London .. stay at the Milestone!"
March 2022,Nikah blessing and dinner,"Thank you to the amazing Leo Forte and his colleagues for the most incredible service on Saturday. We had booked for a Nikah blessing conducted by our Imam, followed by a small champagne reception and dinner for eight - we booked the Oratory room, which was the building’s original chapel. Now a gem of a dining and ceremony room - wood panelling and plenty of original features.  This truly was one of the best customer service experiences I have ever had. Everything was of the highest standard, everyone was so professional yet incredibly friendly. And all so patient and flexible - from the timings, to our niece ordering her fifth mango juice of the evening :)  It was the most special day for us and our family - the memories will last a lifetime.   I can’t recommend this hotel…"
March 2022,Wonderful hotel on a top location,The hotel is all in English style. Very nice decor. With modern comfort. The super staff made us feel very much at home. We had a room with a view on Kensington Palace and park. Even had 2 bathrooms for the 2 of us. It was very comfortable an clean. Cannot think of beter place to stay at this side of London. We would very much like to come back.
March 2022,Mrs Karen Cairns,"Absolutely wonderful, the staff are so friendly, very attentive and nothing’s a problem. Highly recommended,  Great location. The room bright and airy with all mod cons and a lovely turn down service. Breakfast awesome and set us up for the day Will now be our go to hotel when staying in London"
March 2022,Going back in time….,"We spend two nights at this old style, traditional hotel. The first impression was a bit of a disappointment with a relatively small room but during our stay the place grew on us. Staff was friendly.  Considering the small number of rooms (43) there is a really nice gym. Unfortunately, you had to book as only 1 person was allowed there at a time due to Covid. Was a bit of a nuisance that you had to plan when to go but I assume it will change again.  There was a nice restaurant area serving breakfast with a big variety, for both the continental and hot breakfast. The hot breakfast was a huge disappointment as the food was not freshly made but was reheated. Day 2 we opted for the continental which was much better (recommendable)."
March 2022,The most wonderful stay!,"Celebrating my 50th birthday with my sister as well as Mother’s Day! The whole team were so kind and welcoming and could not do enough for you. They made us feel so special and at home.  The minute we arrived in the taxi and Steve said ‘Welcome Home’, we just knew it was going to be a wonderful stay.  Everything from the quality of the food, the Noel Coward Suite (with the most fabulous bathroom and views), to the reception, concierge, bar and restaurant staff. Finished the weekend with a gorgeous lunch in The Oratory which was a complete surprise!  Andrew; you have a gorgeous hotel and must be so proud of your fantastic team! We did not want to leave and are missing Steve’s great sense of humour already. Cannot wait to come back! Thank you so much. Lisa and Tina x"
March 2022,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful service, just right for an anniversary trip","First, I have to confess that this is the only hotel that I've ever stayed in in London, so I can't compare to other options, but it was a perfect experience so I can't imagine how any other hotel could beat it.  From the very first moment, every staff member was extremely courteous and helpful. Just very sweet people who seemed to like each other a lot. My wife were in London for our 25th wedding anniversary, so the friendly, caring environment was greatly appreciated.  The room was beautiful, the bed was extremely comfortable (firm but not too firm), and it was quaint, but large enough to feel roomy. The walls had fabric stretched about 1/4"" from the wall...I don't know if that's a typical English thing or not, but it really gave the room a luxurious feel.  We had breakfast in…"
March 2022,Milestone,"I had a wonderful and unforgettable time at the Milestone. The hotel is elegant; I loved learning about the history of the place. The staff were so kind and attentive, tea time is a must, and the view is beautiful. I cannot wait to go again!"
March 2022,Victoria P,"I had the privilege of staying at The Milestone Hotel this past week. To be frank, this is the best hotel I have ever stayed at. The staff are extremely accommodating, and go out of there way to help their guests. In addition to this, the hotel is absolutely breathtaking. I cannot express how wonderful my stay was at The Milestone, and look forward to coming back!"
March 2022,Exceeded very high expectations,"I have walked past this hotel many times and always wanted to stay there. Often this leads to disappointment. But I’m glad to say that we felt the warm welcome as soon as we stepped through the doors. The staff were wonderful. Friendly, professional and attentive. The glass of complimentary champagne was a lovely surprise  The room (free upgrade) was extremely comfortable and spotlessly clean. The bar was inviting. Cosy and welcoming and I could have watched Lilo making cocktails and smoking whiskey all night.  We will definitely be coming back! Can’t recommend enough."
June 2022,Superb,"I heard of the Milestone from my cousin in London.  It did not disappoint.  High class amenities with detailed oriented service.  Right at the Kensington High Street, you can go shopping or go for a walk in the park.  They have a pool, gym and a sauna.  American style outlets in the room for American guests was a great touch too.  Do the Afternoon Tea if you can!  It was incredible."
June 2022,Perfection,"What can you say about a perfect stay being taken care of by some of the best of the best in the hotel industry, except everything was perfection  From the staff to the food, the rooms to the bed and pillows I cannot fault anything   Rarely am I sad to leave a hotel but I was when I had to leave the Milestone  I cannot imagine staying anywhere else when in London"
May 2022,I didn't want to leave,"I can't express how much we enjoyed our stay at the Milestone. I'm very picky but can't find a thing I'd complain about. The service was over-the-top friendly and impeccable. The employees treated us like family. Jose the concierge planned our days and made reservations to some wonderful restaurants. He also went overboard when he retrieved and shipped my husband's cell phone from the train station lost property office. He wouldn't take a tip for that!   The room was beautiful, well appointed, comfortable and solidly quiet. The hotel was just lovely. Breakfast was delicious.  I can't wait to stay again on my next trip to London."
May 2022,Excellent service,"We chose Milestone to be the venue of our special day and we’re glad that we did. The service that was given was fantastic! Leo was very responsive with all the queries and made sure that everything went according to plan. He even accomdated our last minute alterations which was a very big bonus.  I also commend the amazing and friendly staff, they always make you feel that you’re valued and give their 100% best. A thank you is an understatement for making our special day more special and memorable. Milestone is definitely a highly recommended hotel, with a very accomdating and superb staff. You will surely find your stay worthwhile."
May 2022,A home away from home,"We arrived for a 2 week stay to find our 2 BR Residence already supplied with plenty of food in the fully equipped kitchen, including washer and Dryer and dishwasher.  With a little exploring, we found several food stores, the Goat Tavern and a wonderful little Italian restaurant just down the block.   Many of our favorite museums are within a short walk.  If we needed to go further afield, the Kensington High tube station and bus stops were very convenient.  All of that was wonderful, but the very best part of staying at the Milestone was the staff!  To a person, each was unfailingly helpful from a bucket of ice and a lemon in our apartment daily at 5 PM to directions and recommendations as well as attentive listening to our adventures at the end of the day.  I really can't…"
June 2022,Amazing Hospitality,"We just checked out of the Milestone after a wonderful stay. Starting with the service and hospitality, it was simply perfect. Everyone working at the hotel including Jose and Steve are so generous and kind. Our room was very unique and comfortable. The Milestone truly makes you feel at home and I would highly recommend this hotel. Next time I am in London, I would like to return!"
May 2022,Overall satisfaction.,We felt you were totally taking care of us.  At no time did we fell we were alone.  We were to leave several days ago but because of our exposure to  Covid we were not able to return to the US.  Now we can we are almost saddened.  We will return.   Thank you.
May 2022,Ann Forkey,"I have just found my new favorite hotel in London! The “Milestone Hotel and Residences” in Kensington was wonderful. From beginning to end everything was perfect- the location was phenomenal (being located directly across from Kensington Garden and Palace), the interiors were exquisite and the food was delicious, but most important was the service. The staff were a very friendly well trained group of professionals who made me feel like I was at home.  I absolutely loved staying there and can’t wait to come back again soon. I can’t thank them enough for making me feel safe and sound at their beautiful hotel!"
May 2022,Tea time,Wonderfull place nice workers delicious pastries and generous quantities  They even suggested a take away bag because we couldn’t finish all the dishes They offer skones also home made It’s also well placed I totally recommend 💯
April 2022,Rooms matters,"We stayed in a deluxe queen. When we first arrived we were given a room with a small ""queen bed"". The first room to us was really small and the bed seemed the size of two twin beds. We would have really regretted our stay. That is why I'm rating the rooms average. The first room we had should be for single travelers or a different category. We asked to move and luckily there was a room available in the ""same"" category. It made all the difference not only was the bed bigger but also the room itself. Beyond that the staff were helpful, responsive, and friendly. The warm breakfast was great. The hotel is in a nice area by stores, shopping, and restaurants. It felt safe to walk around and close to the subway. The hotel is nicely styled. Not large and grand more of a boutique feel.…"
October 2021,Ataur & Livia Wedding Reception,"This hotel and it’s staff are absolutely amazing, they could not be any more helpful, such lovely and very nice people, they made us feel like royalty. We celebrated our wedding reception here with family and friends and the experience thanks to the hotel was absolutely 5 star. I enjoyed Avery minute of and will be coming back every year to celebrate my anniversary here. Leo Forte was the best, he made us feel so comfortable and had everything under control. He went above and beyond with everything, from the welcome, to the food and the decorations, I honestly cannot praise him enough. Angelo was amazing with the Sabbrage and allowing me to try, a memory I will forever cherish. The food was amazing thanks to the chef Daniel and his team. This hotel has been the best I have been…"
October 2021,JimG,"Great find, small clean, amazing service. The Stables Bar hosted by Angelo made it a unique and pleasant visit. He loves making cocktails. Makes a Old Fashion using a unique blend of scotch and whiskey 🥃"
September 2021,Outstanding hotel with loads of English charm!,"We had a marvelous stay at The Milestone Hotel!  The doorman Steve enthusiastically greeted us upon arrival and check-in was super easy with friendly and welcoming staff.  The hotel itself is charming with English “touches” everywhere.  Hotel was immaculate and felt very safe with their Covid precautions.  They gave us a complimentary upgrade on our room to a king size bed.  The room was clean and updated with an extremely comfy bed and pillows.  The room had an outlet panel that allowed for American plugs so super helpful for hair straightener and charging our iPhones without having to use a voltage converter, even though we had brought one.  We didn’t spend a lot of time at the hotel as we were out and about seeing the sights of London, but did enjoy a few drinks in the bar…"
August 2021,"Amazing wedding and a lovely stay, thank you so much!","The team at Milestone helped us organise our small, intimate wedding after COVID ruined our plans for a big countryside wedding.  I just wanted to say both Leo and Angelo did an amazing job and we'll be customers for life. Couldn't be happier with it."
September 2021,Absolutely outstanding venue for a private dinner,"We were looking for a venue to host a private dinner for 24 people to celebrate two “significant” birthdays. From the first contact with Milestone they could not have been more friendly, efficient and professional. The interior of the hotel is very elegant and reminiscent of its private home origins. Suggestions for organising the evening which began with drinks in the Lounge followed by dinner on three tables in the Windsor room were very helpful. On the night everything from the greeting of guests by the doorman, through to the service in the Lounge and then the dinner were very organised. We had been offered a choice of menus for the guests to select from and all of them have commented on the quality of the three courses, the Amuse Bouche and the Pre- desert. A very enjoyable…"
September 2021,a lovely return....,"We haven't visited The Milestone for a few years, and happily returned to this beautiful and excellently-run hotel.  It is everything one expects of a 5* and more.  Andrew and his entire team, from housekeeping to maintenance and front-of house to dining are a credit to the prestigious Red Carnation Group.  Safety measures are carefully observed without being intrusive, and attention to detail is key.  Thank you all for a wonderful stay."
September 2021,Afternoon Tea,"Went here for afternoon tea. The room where tea was served was much smaller than I expected and was really only big enough for 4/5 couples. This meant that we could hear other people’s conversations, particularly two gents who were talking loudly while having tea , which was a bit off putting. However, that is where the criticism ends.   The staff were very polite and went above and beyond to make the experience really nice. The selection of sandwiches and cakes was fantastic and delicious. There was a variety of teas to try and we were offered top ups of all refreshments- if you can manage it. We were too full!   I would definitely recommend this hotel for afternoon tea."
September 2021,5 star hotel with 6 star staff.,"The Milestone hotel truly lives up to Bea Tollman’s saying ‘You can build a palace, but it means nothing if you don’t focus on your guests. All guests want to feel special’…. The staff were very successful in this. Making my partner and I feel that we were the only guests and totally special.  An awesome hotel, steeped in history and an individual uniqueness."
August 2021,Two night stay at the Milestone Hotel and our wedding day!,"The team at the milestone and I worked together the last few months in preparation to the wedding day and we felt special throughout.  Leo and his team were absolutely amazing and definitely offered five star service. Leo assisted us with the wedding planning, he went above and beyond to ensure the day went exactly as planned, he even allocated us the perfect guest room - which made me relax on the day as I needed the extra space to do hair and makeup.   Daniel (the chef) custom made the dinner menu and the food was absolutely perfect! It was the best Beef Wellington me and our guests have ever had. We have not stop getting compliments about how great the service and the food was.   Thank you to Leo, Daniel and their teams for making my wedding day extra special to me and my now…"
August 2021,"Excellent stay, charming hotel and fabulous team","Lovely welcome by Tara and the concierge team plus a welcome drink of champagne. Room 303 with small balcony. Intimate room with ""hidden"" wardrobes. Loved the décor and history the Stables (bar). Angelo in the bar è molto bouno. Ruinart champagne offered, a favourite of mine.  Housekeeping prompt and efficient.  Very comfortable bed and quality linen. Probably the best hairdryer I've ever used in a hotel of this standard, with socket and mirror to hand. A superficial point perhaps but important to me! Peaceful outside with very little road noise (Sunday night).  Breakfast very good in beautiful dining room. Enjoyed the cartoon artwork.  Steve the concierge is knowledgeable, friendly  and has lots of suggestions. Very welcoming.  Great location. Highly recommended. Much enjoyed. …"
December 2021,Christmas Came early for us!,"I was hoping to keep this 5 star property the best kept secret in London!   I have reviewed dozens of hotels and restaurants in London over the last 25 years, but I cannot remember when I thought an experience was so deserving of an excellent review!  Having been recommended by some friends to stay at the property we booked two rooms for our Christmas shopping weekend, upon arrival at the Steve greeted us with a warm welcome, this warm welcome continued at our check in desk with Aurelle, our luggage was immediately taken to our to exquisitely appointed rooms, this property has the boutique feel of opulence which has been lost in the more well known 5 start hotels in central London, I certainly have paid considerably more for far less quality,style, and service at other…"
December 2021,This is rare praise - Staff was truly outstanding and property embodied classic British ambience,"I am truly feeling privileged to write such a glowing review. Its rare, as I travel globally and often, so this is really saying something. My colleague and I were in London for a week of meetings and incredibly busy.  The staff - great personalities, remembered our names after the first day, helped us with anything we needed. I could name many of them but then I would have a long list! What surprised me was the true feeling of caring - I know this may sound odd but this team did not make us feel like they were working at a job. They made us feel as though they were happy with what they were doing and each individual was a professional and bent over backwards to make sure every detail of our stay was catered to. Do I need to tell you that is so very rare these days? So kudos to…"
December 2021,Deserves more than 5 stars!,"Excellent customer service from all staff, Nutten, Fran and Mansour were great. Very attentive, helpful , friendly and at our service. Nutten showed us several rooms before my wife agreed to one. They allowed early check in snd late check out. Overall anazing ghrought!"
December 2021,"Not so good in parts, overall though a nice stay. I would come again.","Try and keep this short. All in all, the hotel was a nice stay. Great little details are part of the stay. The interior is nice. They’re the odd flaws with decor, which I’ll add with photos. With 5 star the interior should be on point and you need to be hiring people who can do diy well. So not good in parts. The car service that’s part of the hotel, you have to prebook, which it doesn’t say that on the booklet in the hotel, so that needs to be corrected. The cocktail I had, wasn’t good. The guy behind the bar is poor at what he does. Not a good time as the bar at all, didn’t finish my drink and I just left. My partners was ok, but it was a simply gin and tonic, so how wrong can it go, the presentation could have been better. The service was very slow. The bar snacks came late…"
October 2021,A brilliant stay,"This was a short stay but thoroughly relaxing. The hotel is english mansion style (but in London) with outstanding service. Particular thank you to Angelo in the bar who was fantastic snd made some great recommendations.   The hotel thinks of everything, something I like. The staff are not fussy or overbearing but friendly and engaging. Despite spending only 24 hours here I came incredibly relaxed after a fairly stressful week.  Stayed in a studio room which I’d highly recommend. The room felt spacious and was very comfortable. I think the beds are savoir- they were very comfortable anyway! Needless to say the room was spotless and turndown was excellent.   The whole hotel is charming. If your definition of luxury is the very latest technology, a huge pool etc, this isn’t the…"
November 2021,Afternoon Tea was fantastic,"Visited The Milestone Hotel for Afternoon Tea with my mother. We had an absolutely fantastic time, the food was delicious and they were generous with their portions, we were so full we ended up taking some sweet treats home with us. We were served by Leo and Paulo and they were so welcoming and we felt extremely well looked after. Would recommend to everyone. Thank you all for a very special time."
November 2021,Home from Home,"After  a really hectic few months, my husband and I were looking forward to spending a few nights at the Milestone Hotel, it did not disappoint. All the staff pulled out the all the stops to ensure we had a really comfortable break, their attention to detail was excellent in all departments.  My welcome card read Welcome home Mrs P and that’s how it felt. We had a wonderful stay and came home refreshed"
November 2021,Home again !,"I absolutely love the Milestone, the team, the ambiance.  I cannot imagine staying anywhere else when I am in London;  this time was no different.  The fact I can bring my dog as well just makes it even more special.  She was treated as well (if not better!) than me. Her own bed, bowls and treats.  Just wonderful.  There are so many good points and so many fabulous staff to mention -  from walking through the front door, to the bar where my dog could join me, it is all impeccable."
November 2021,Fantastic Christmas Weekend,"After a trip to Winter Wonderland walking through the doors of The Milestone was like walking into a home from home.  We stopped into the stables bar for a couple of drinks and were served by Angelo - fantastic service, amazing atmosphere!  My partner had the Milestone Traditional which comes in its own smoke filled bubble and was a joy to experience.  I had the Valkyrie drink and the Rocking Horse - both as beautiful as they were delightful.     The room was just stunning!  A level of class and comfort unmatched so far in my time in London.  The bed was so comfy we almost overslept!    All service was impeccable and calm - you forget they are there until you need them, and then they’re there happy to help.   Can’t recommend this place enough and will most definitely be back…"
November 2021,Festive Afternoon Tea,"This was my second visit to The Milestone ‘post pandemic’ and this time I tried their take on a Christmas afternoon tea. wow. I type this from my sofa and I still feel completely and utterly indulged.  The service team were fantastic, the lounge was full but the team were still attentive, smiling and taking care of all guests with ease.  We tried several teas and enjoyed a half bottle of champagne.  The selection was outstanding and by far the best Turkey sandwich I have ever had.  Kudos to the milestone team, especially mr Ahuja who took my booking, greeted me and my family on arrival and even checked on my table."
August 2021,Simply amazing,The Milestone is my favorite London hotel and look forward to staying here every visit we have to UK. All the staff here are absolutely lovely and so kind. Breakfast is fantastic with a lot of options. Comfortable and quiet rooms and perfect location.
August 2021,Amazing Stay,"We just got back from another amazing stay at the Milestone.  We stayed a week, had two rooms, one for me and my wife and the other for our two daughters, 11 and 14.  This was our third stay in 4 years.  So we can definitely state that COVID has not changed the experience at the Milestone.  Still the same friendly staff, that truly make you feel like you are coming home.  The hotel was as usual very clean and the rooms taken care of every day. The restaurant was great, had breakfast every morning and dinner one night.  Really would not know COVID had changed anything other than the staff wear masks.  The breakfast buffet is gone but you can still order anything and they bring it to you.  They were very attentive to our daughter's food allergies.  And the concierge team did an…"
July 2021,Utterly divine in every way!,"My mum and I stayed at the Milestone this weekend and it was utterly DIVINE! We were celebrating my graduation, and the hotel went above and beyond to make it super special. The staff were all charming, especially our main host Quentin, and the lovely doorman Tim; all very attentive and it was top class service. The hotel itself wasn’t missing a thing- our room had the most beautiful views of Kensington gardens, and everything was pristinely cleaned with all the tip top finishing touches. The spa was also beautiful, and the breakfast was amazing. I couldn’t recommend this hotel more, whether that be for friends/family/couples, and I will absolutely be returning. Thank you for the perfect stay!"
July 2021,A Perfect Location,"I had my sisters Bridal shower on 3rd July this year.  The team at the Milestone hotel were absolutely impeccable. They were perfect, they made us feel so welcome and went out of their way to accommodate all of our needs. From helping us load items into the car, to receiving items for the Bridal shower before we arrived at the venue. I cannot fault a single thing. I would personally like to thank Leo for all his help from the start of my enquiry to finishing my event he went above and beyond so thank you Leo. We had more than enough food and drink which guests boasted how lovely and delicious it was. The venue was perfect and I hope to use it again in future as the staff and experience at the milestone  hotel Left such a lasting impression on me and my guests. Thank you so much…"
August 2021,Afternoon Tea,"There are about a zillion places to have afternoon tea in London, but we chose this place because it had good reviews and the pictures looked good.  When we arrived, the doorman knew our names and welcomed us in - a little touch that made us feel very welcome.  The building and interior are stunning, and we were welcomed into a cosy room straight out of the 1920s and about as plush and luxurious as you get.  The food was magnificent and plentiful. Lots of sandwiches with interesting fillings and beautiful cakes. We were told to let them know when we wanted the scones as they were baked freshly for us, and indeed they were as they were served warm with home made jam and thick clotted cream.  The table setting was stunning and the staff were both attentive and friendly, but not…"
August 2021,GREAT AFTERNOON TEA FOR THOSE WITH ALLERGIES,"I have a milk allergy so finding an afternoon tea suitable has been hard, however milestone were fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff. Felt like royalty. The rod was amazing and to be able to have such a variety of cakes was brilliant. We will be back!"
July 2021,Top class,"Absolutely fabulous, totally recommend this hotel, the staff are at the top of their game , professional, friendly, helpful and genuinely care about the guests. The cocktails in the bar are top draw , my suite was very good . Well done Milestone you win my vote , Thank you for everything"
July 2021,They go the extra mile at The Milestone Hotel and Residence,"We spent 3 nights from the 22nd July to 25th July, it was my 70th birthday on the 23rd and my wife`s  67th birthday on 24th, and I can honestly say that from the moment we entered the hotel, to the time we left there was nothing they wouldn`t do to make our stay special. I would like to say a BIG thank you to the reception for all their help, and the restaurant staff for their excellent service and great breakfasts. I would also like to thank the manager for my birthday cake and drink.   Thanks again for a great time."
July 2021,"Classy, Elegant, Traditional, 10/10 service","A beautifully stunning hotel, where you are made to feel welcome the moment you are at the door.  The service the guys throughout this hotel provided was incredible, they honestly could not do more for you, it was a pleasure to be treated like that, wherever you are in the hotel.  Be sure to book the pool and the sauna facilities on/before arrival, the room/hotel has stunning decor and is beautifully kept. The restaurant area is class.  It was also great to see Andrew the manager in the foyer, at the front of house talking with guests, this shows guests are important and appreciated.  My wife and I were here for our anniversary and it was made to feel special. With Kensington Gardens on your literal doorstep, and the High Street round the corner, You are in for a treat staying…"
June 2021,Faultless from start to finish…..,Faultless From Start to Finish  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left the service was fantastic. We were welcomed home and it felt like an oasis amidst the buzz of a reawakening London. We were celebrating what should have been our honeymoon and the staff treated us like royalty from beginning to end. Breakfast was sublime the room was spotless and we will definitely be back.   Thank you to all the team at The Milestone. We can’t recommend you enough.
June 2021,Simply superb,"What a simply delightful experience! Stayed for two nights, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The room was a good size for a London hotel, with beautiful, comfortable duvets, pillows and linen, an attractive and well stocked bathroom and more than enough storage space.  All food and drinks were spot on and the dinner in the main restaurant was superb. My other half had the Dover sole, and me the lamb..both tasted exquisite and were partnered with cracking wine, ably advised by the attentive yet discreet waiting team.  The spa / gym is open (you need to book) and the bars are open too.  Finally, from the moment you are met at the steps, until the moment you depart, the service is impeccable.  Will be our go to London hotel for sure, from now on, as the location is perfect too. 5…"
June 2021,Excellent,"Excellent hotel. Great location in Kensington. Fabulous staff, couldn’t do enough for us. Lots of character. Spotlessly clean. Delicious breakfast. No tea/coffee in room so when I called reception they brought some freshly brewed drinks straight to our room."
June 2021,An incredible experience all round,"We could not recommend this hotel enough. The staff are absolutely wonderful and so welcoming. We bought our dog and he was treated just as special as we were. He got his own bed, bottled water and a towel. We opted for a pet sitter and because there was not one available, Fran at the hotel stayed and looked after him for us, which we were truly grateful for. The bed was one of the comfiest beds I have stayed in. The room was lovely and sparkling clean. We even had a drink at the bar and that was lovely too. This hotel made our weekend away. Whilst it was our first time staying at this hotel, it will not be our last."
July 2021,Above and beyond,"Well, where do I start, the hotel service was amazing, the night staff where so helpful. The kept the spa area open after hours for me as it we were newly weds. The hotels rooms are impeccable, clean, comfortable. The bathrooms are WOW! Powerful shower and hot hot water! AC rooms. Would 100 % recommend. And can’t wait to be back again! Thank you Milstone staff.   Mr and Mrs Tariq"
July 2021,Excellent service and generosity,Nitin was very helpful during my visit to hotel. I didn't stay there but needed help and he went miles to help me. Jose Was very generous with directions to help me during my time in London. I will be back soon.
July 2021,Hospitality at its finest,"We had the chance to celebrate our wedding anniversary and having started a new job down the road, this was a perfect venue and timing. On arrival all the front of house staffs including Lorena, Tara and Steve welcomed us, very pleasant and smiling. We went for a drink to the bar, my husband tried the signature old fashioned - it’s an experience you’ll never forget. Angelo the mixologist does a fantastic job to showcase his expertise, you got to go to The Stables bar. We then headed to The Cheneston’s restaurant - very cozy with a grand Victorian decor with wooden panel and lovely caricatures. Grant and Paolo were simply brilliant they explained the menu very well, did check back, offered options and genuinely serve with care. Kudos to the chef for the great British menu they…"
July 2021,Lovely stay and staff.,Staying at the Milestone Hotel was absolutely delightful. The staff were absolutely lovely and so attentive. Access to the pool and sauna were a lovely treat. I would definitely recommend staying here.
July 2021,Delightful afternoon tea,"Had champagne afternoon tea before visiting the Van Gogh exhibition. Best afternoon tea we’ve had in London. Excellent sandwiches, freshly made scones and also strawberries in addition to the fabulous selection of cakes. Would highly recommend and looking forward to our next visit."
July 2021,Perfect from start to finish - Very friendly,"We arrived for the Wimbledon weekend, and the minute we walked up to the front door, we were treated with amazing service and friendliness.  Front Door man was expecting us, and parked car as arranged. Front concierge and every member of staff were so friendly an helpful .  Free glass of champagne each taken in bar once we packed ( spent tens of thousands in the Dorchester for double + the money and never had a sniff of a free drink ). Bar food was excellent.  Sky TV in room. Room was perfect, water and chocolates each night on turn down service. Bathroom very big .  Breakfasts amazing. Decor beautiful.   Thank you for everyone at the Hotel, who made our stay an amazing experience, and we will now use this as our base in London... perfect in every way.... could not recommend…"
June 2021,Delightful hotel,"An unexpected 2 nights in London meant a  hotel booking to a hotel we have never stayed in . Any london trip from now on will mean staying at the Milestone . In a time where covid is an excuse for bad service, the staff at the Milestone were exemplary . Nothing was too much trouble  The stables bar is beautiful , the rooms are luxurious , the location is perfect and the service is 1st class  See you again soon"
October 2019,The best 70th Birthday ever!,"The Milestone is like waking up in Downton Abbey where your staff is concerned about your happiness, health, comfort and satisfaction.  And, your staff is wonderful!  They even made me a birthday cake!  My travel mates and I are still talk about our delicious breakfasts and the kind, considerate service.  We highly recommend this hotel; it’s a great experience."
November 2019,Impressive Hotel in Every Aspect,"I’m not a huge fan of small or ‘boutique’ hotels.  Any type of descriptive label, deliberate or not, in my personal opinion is a euphemism for hiding a deficiency.  Not that Milestone advertises itself as a boutique hotel, and in fact does not come across as having this grandiose and pretentious air other hotels sometimes have.    Having had to change our plans from staying in Zurich to London instead, I found myself looking at last minute hotel availability in London.  With decent last-minute availability, numerous hotels came up and Milestone peaked my interest due to its location and great online reviews.  I was a little hesitant to book it due to its apparent small size (more on that later) and availability (as opposed to other hotels that were fully booked), but went ahead…"
November 2019,Great service and location,"First the great: the concierge and door men are awesome! They make you feel welcome and at home. The location is right across from Hyde Park. My only regret is I didn’t bring my cold weather running gear. Over our stay we had breakfast, tea, dinner, and drinks at the hotel and all were wonderful! I would say the tea was the best! Highly recommend!  The “ok”: The rooms are on the smaller side and although we had an upgrade with our credit card they couldn’t accommodate. The room service did a good job but she would pound on the door for turn down service while we were getting ready to go out. She would seem annoyed that we were still there.  All and all: the people, food, and location make this hotel 5 stars!"
November 2019,Impeccable service and generous hospitality (just as they promise).,"My wife and I stayed here on the first night of our honeymoon in 1969 before flying off to Portugal the following day. As we arrived at 9pm and left early the following morning we saw little of the hotel then and had always said we should stay there again one day. 50 years later, as part of our Golden Wedding celebrations this month, as I had booked for us to see Jools Holland at the Albert Hall, I thought I would book a two day stay at The Milestone. So, I contacted the hotel and arranged this as a surprise for my wife. I am so pleased I did (and, I’m pleased to say, so was my wife) as we both found the hotel to be well beyond any expectations we may have had. The location is, of course also excellent and convenient.  From the moment we arrived and the reception we received the…"
November 2019,Outstanding Hotel in London,"I recently stayed at The Milestone for a business trip for three nights.  This was my first stay at this hotel but had stayed previously at other Red Carnation hotels in the city and always had been impressed.  The Milestone didn’t let me down.  The hotel is located in a fantastic area across from the park.  The property is spotless and well maintained with common areas that make you feel like your at home and not in a hotel.  The room was absolutely wonderful, very comfortable and functional with a bathroom I fell in love with (I want the fixtures for my own home).  There was plenty of room to relax and work and the got a perfect night sleep.  Housekeeping was outstanding and everything was spotless my entire stay.  The amenities in the room were first class.  One of the main…"
October 2019,Felt Like Home,"I normally prefer the big fancy hotel chains, this hotel has changed that for me. Everyone knew my name almost immediately. My room felt like home. The bar is exactly what I’d dream up if I could design the perfect place to have a meal and glass of wine after a long day.  The breakfast, which was included, was incredible.  Perfectly located across the street from Kensington Palace, walking everyday in the park was a joy. Shopping all around. Can’t wait to return. "
November 2019,Traditional afternoon Tea,"We were bought a traditional afternoon tea as a gift from a friend. We received a lovely traditional friendly welcome, and were introduced to our waitress. The room we were in was empty (which was a shame as I love to nose 👃). It was nicely decorated and not too fussy and really lovely and clean. We were given a table for two in the corner. I had already let them know that one of us was vegi and they were excellent with communicating this. When the sandwiches and cakes 🍰 were brought over they were very good and put the two cakes that had gelatine in on a different plate which I appreciated. The sandwiches were good, cakes 🧁 were good lots of variety, and after that there are scones ! The scones were better than the cakes in my opinion. Its worth noting that they are happy…"
November 2019,Work and Tennis,"I was in London for business and I stayed 3 night onto the Milestone Hotel. Absolutely fantastic. Typical English space...the room was very elegant and refined...toilet with bidet...everything clean. Fantastic English breakfast...I went to the O2 Arena to see ATP finals and when I came back...in the room I found some sweets in the shape of a tennis ball...great! Special thanks to Natalia Crudele ... very friendly, helpful and attentive to detail ...and the barman Angelo ...also very friendly and available!"
November 2019,Just when you think a hotel can’t get any better,"It had been almost two years since we last visited The Milestone. Two years too long.   Just when you think a hotel can’t get any better (I’ve given them 100% in the past) The Milestone does.   Their attention to detail is remarkable. The rooms are beautiful. The bar and restaurant are olde worlde without being stuffy.   But it’s the staff that make the Milestone magical.   From the first welcome back (using our name) to the final enthusiastic wave off, every member of the team gave 110%. And the bar staff? 150%!  They are amazing. Making a G&T becomes a work of art, pouring champagne perfection and if you really want to see a show, order a Milestone Old Fashioned - Wow!!   We stayed two nights in a club suite room overlooking the park. It’s a clever two story design with a…"
October 2019,Well now!,"This was an excellent hotel. We mentioned that we were celebrating a special occasion, and you'd have thought they were celebrating their own instead of helping ours be special. They decorated our room for it, gave us a kind welcome card, and left us all sorts of biscuits and other treats from their kitchens to help us celebrate.  The staff here was so attentive and helpful, even for just a one-night stay; it impressed us very much.  The room was just beautiful, we'd have been happy to stay longer. Very comfortable, huge bed; sofa; desks; not wanting for space at all. The common areas of the hotel were also striking, with gorgeous dark hardwood everywhere, fit for a pipe-smoking Oxford don.   The location is a really (famously) pleasant part of London; it's right on Hyde Park,…"
November 2019,Wonderful British Experience,"If you're looking for a wonderful hotel filled with English charm, the Milestone Hotel is the place for you. The location is perfect - directly across from Hyde Park in the heart of Kensington, The rooms are lovely and the staff could not be more accommodating. The Milestone combines the historic feel of old England with modern amenities. Five stars in every category!"
March 2020,Look No Further,"For those of you looking for the best hotel, the best experience, the best home away from home extraordinary experience, look no further than the Milestone Hotel in London, England. Their exemplary service, accommodations, food, offerings, and concierge access and care will be one of the highlights of your experience and stay in London. Connor at the Concierge desk took such a genuine interest in researching events and plays in the area for my daughter and I to enjoy. Within in minutes we had the best seats at the Lion King and with another request for Lady Diana memorials, he had printed off and mapped out our route along with our following days to make the most of our three days in London. Tim, the doorman, helped us with securing and locating our drivers and David and Antonio…"
January 2020,A home in a Hotel,"In very simple sentience with a full of meaning, milestones hotel is the best hotel in London’s  you can  enjoy the stay with your family, friends, work . You feel that you are in your home , a lot of caring, happiness, smiling, delicious food, relax spa ... & a lot ... , they make a very romantic & family birthday night, love to go there again very soon ."
February 2020,"Incredible hotel, wonderful staff, intimate bar, perfect for families!","The entire Milestone team was incredible!  Our room was beautiful and the staff went above and beyond to ensure our family had the trip of a lifetime. Our kids got to make their own ""mocktails"" in the beautiful bar and even put on the bartender jackets! The room was second to none and entire experience was one of the most memorable experiences of our trip. We will definitely return!"
February 2020,Superb Luxury small hotel with best London location,"We stayed  3 nights in this gorgeous hotel and we had a great time! Very friendly staff, wonderful rooms, lovely breakfast, everything was stunning! The location of the hotel is the best location in London. Many thanks to reception and concierge staff, especially Mrs. Georgiana Jercan who made our stay an unforgetable one. In summer we have 2 trips to London and undoubtedly we will stay to this wonderful hotel who already made us feel part of Red Carnation's Hotels family!"
January 2020,Incredible - couldn't recommend more,"Stayed recently at The Milestone Hotel after numerous year of visiting London. Was given a beautiful. quaint queen room with everything that you could wish for with so many beautiful little touches.   The front facing team are all so incredibly attentive, kind and caring. It would be a crime to name just a few when they all treated me and my partner like royalty. It felt as if we were making friends for life, not visiting a hotel.  The food, across the board, was phenomenal. Room service breakfast was amazing, the perfect start to the day and almost as good as the huge buffet offering in the restaurant. Afternoon Tea was decadent and we definitely enjoyed the option of walking in Kensington Gardens afterwards. The Stables Bar is so full of old world charm but with modern and…"
February 2020,Best stay,Best service and the best hotel ever. It had everything included from a swimming pool to a gym to a lovely breakfast and an incredible bar and restaurant. All staff is so attentive and eager to please. The room 507 is lovely as it oversees the park. We loved our very brief stay and will return ASAP.
February 2020,Superb luxury hotel,"Wow what a stunning hotel it’s just over the road from Kensington Palace and The Royal Albert Hotel is just up the road. Hotel was immaculate. Hotel staff were fantastic they was very friendly nothing was too much trouble they couldn’t help you enough I felt like royalty they carried our cases up to our room, opened the doors we got a welcome drink on arrival and as it was my birthday they even presented me with a birthday dessert. It’s an easy location to reach via tube or taxi. Great bar with plenty of choice of drinks from soft drinks to cocktails. The breakfast was amazing ordered room service it’s was delivered on time and it was cooked to perfection. Would highly recommend staying here"
November 2019,Never dissapoints,"This is a, somewhat, delayed review having stayed at the Milestone at the end of November. Regrettably, illness prevented my submitting this review earlier. I must add that my illness was nothing to do with the hotel.  A truly outstnding hotel that never dissaponts. i am unable to find fault with any aspect of the hotel and we look forward to returning soon."
February 2020,BAR SERVICE GREAT,"I been in the bar with a friend, for a couple of drink, the bar manager Angelo was great, very kind ,friendly, warm professional and  lot of knowledges. Nice atmosphere, bar service excellent and drinks delicious! I’ll back 100%  Keep going guys"
October 2019,An excellent hotel,The old Victoria era in today's world  There is nothing negative to say about this hotel is a 5 star from rooms to service  Congratulations to the staff for making our stay a relax and enjoyable holiday
June 2019,Wonderful Experience,"After passing by this hotel numerous times during trips to London as well as taking high tea in the lounge a few years earlier, we decided to book in to see if what we had built up in our minds was indeed the reality of it. In a nutshell, it was and so much more. The staff was wonderfully accommodating, kind and helpful from the moment we arrived until the last goodbye the following day. Our room was upgraded to a newly renovated suite, which was beautiful and very comfortable. No amenity was overlooked and we were treated like royalty. Drinks and appetizers in the bar were wonderfully innovative, delicious, and presented in a lovely way, as was breakfast the following day. Sadly, we only stayed one night but on our next visit, we plan to stay longer. If you are looking for a…"
October 2019,brilliant hotel,"one of our best hotel experiences ever. service was superb. food  & cocktails delicious. their dining restaurant, chenestons, was a real discovery. afternoon tea was a delight. looking forward to our next visit."
October 2019,50th birthday and Silver Wedding Anniversary,We had a joint celebration of my wife’s 50th birthday and our silver wedding anniversary and wanted to make it special. We were made to feel extremely welcome right from the start with a really nice glass of champagne before being taken to our room. There were many thoughtful touches in our room and in the hotel too numerous to mention during our four day stay. We are not exaggerating in saying this is probably the nicest hotel for quality of service and ambience we have ever stayed at.  Nothing was too much trouble. We are already planning our next break and we will be definitely be staying at this hotel again. Thank you for making our stay so memorable.
October 2019,Now #1 on our list.,"We’ve been fortunate to stay in some memorable hotels, but the Milestone clearly notches in as our #1 choice.  Our stay was nine days in one of the multi-bedroom residences.  Unassuming from the exterior, the DNA of this well maintained, luxury hotel is absolutely first rate.  Most importantly, the staff from the doorman to the restaurant servers were friendly and helpful.  Their hospitality set the tone for entire visit.  The bedrooms had the standard items you would expect … sufficient lighting, multiple power outlets, ultra-clean bathroom, safe, thermostat on the wall, writing desk, firm mattress, and good linens.  Unexpected were the light dimmers, motorized curtains, and the blue, motion sensor controlled, overhead nightlight in the bath – a surreal experience.  Our…"
October 2019,Hotel Management At Its Finest,"I stayed at the Milestone from October 7th - 11th.  Let me first begin by stating that I have family in the hotel business in England--so I know a few things about how an English hotel should function successfully.  That being said, the Milestone is run very professionally, and the hallmark of all the staff is kindness.  I realize kindness doesn't usually correlate with ""professional,"" but the staff, here, shows genuine kindness in all of the verbal and offerings details that impacts one's stay.  The interior is immaculate.  The decor is gentleman;s club, but not stuffy.  The dining experience is the equivalent of any Michelin-starred London restaurant--thanks to the chefs, the wait staff, and the two fine maitres d'hotel, Messrs. Paolo and Augustin.  Mr. Ahuja is the best front…"
October 2019,Perfection in Kensington,"Absolutely fabulous hotel. Beautiful in every way from the room to the lobby to the bar and the restaurant. Great service, wonderful friendly staff. Had a delicious, delightful afternoon tea, a light breakfast and drinks and coffee in the bar. Perfection!! Wonderful bath and soaps and shower gel in the bath, comfy bed, delicious nighttime sweets. Fabulous location a bit away from it all, but not to far from Kensington tube station. Highly recommended!  "
October 2019,A magical experience in this jewelbox hotel and charming neighborhood,"I just stayed here and cannot recommend it highly enough. There was a snag with my original flight so I had to postpone my trip, and they rebooked my hotel stay free of charge. Everyone was attentive without hovering, the facilities were top-notch, and the morning breakfast spread, which was included with my room, was delicious - even included a fresh green juice. It’s right across the street from Kensington Gardens, near the tube, in a lovely neighborhood that feels like you’re really living in London. Can’t wait to return!"
October 2019,London’s Secret,"My wife and myself had the pleasure of staying at the boutique hotel on the 4th October, from the moment we arrived we could not fault the service we received from all the staff at the hotel, I would also highly recommend the old fashioned tequila cocktail and if your a couple I would also recommend the romance deal as well.  I would like to of kept this hotel secret to others but it just wouldn’t be fare not to say just how good this hotel is"
September 2019,Simply Amazing!,"From the beginning to the end of our stay the staff and services at this red carnation hotel were far exceeding all expectations. Superb location,always helpful happy staff. I have stayed around the world in many many boutique hotels and this is by far the finest. Our Bellmen Tim and Zdravko as well as the management thank you! World class."
August 2019,Afternoon tea birthday celebrations ,We visited as a family of 12 for afternoon tea for my husband’s birthday. The whole experience from booking to the actual event was flawless. Chloe was amazing accommodating the booking requirements and there were a few changes. Leo looked after us and nothing was too much trouble. Peggy was great when we left. The conservatory room was the perfect setting. The children loved the princess and prince tea and even got to decorate cakes. Thank you for making this an unforgettable birthday where the professionalism and care was top notch. The venue was beautiful and the staff are a credit to this venue. 
August 2019,Outstanding service and location in London,"We recently travelled to London and stayed at this charming hotel in Kensington. The staff was outstanding and went well beyond our expectations to make our trip special. The concierge desk was amazing and very helpful, all of the recommendations were spot on. The breakfast was delicious and staff was most accommodating. Our room was beautiful and impeccably cleaned everyday. It was the highlight of out trip to London and we will certainly go back."
July 2019,Friendliest Staff and Amazing Hospitality,"We stayed as a family of 4 adults and 4 children first in the three bedroom residence and then in three hotel rooms. We Have traveled many times to London and stayed at top hotels in the world but Milestone Customer Service comes definitely on the top of the list. Each request on the guest preference form was fulfilled. Each room is designed uniquely and has very posh interiors, high quality beddings and top notch toiletries. The location is close to Museums and Kensington Palace. The breakfast is superb variety and delicious. They even arranged an Indian Veg menu for our family breakfast. The afternoon tea is a must try. The concierge team goes out of the way to assist. Special mention for Blake Sur from Reservations, Tara from Reception and Vanja from Breakfast team. Can’t…"
July 2019,Highly Expensive but it worth for this experience,Expensive but really beautiful hotel in London. Beautiful rooms equipped with every comfort with huge double beds with balcony. Fantastic bathroom with all the necessities. Buffet breakfast to make the double banquets envious. Very nice swimming pool Great service and staff. In front of the structure there are many restaurants
August 2019,5-Star Birthday Weekend,"As a frequent traveler for both work and pleasure, I have had the opportunity to stay at many 5-star properties globally...nothing quite compares to this one! I was blown away by the staff and how not a detail went unnoticed - truly a 5-star experience! I recommend booking a picnic in Hyde Park (across the street) if you have the opportunity during this seasonal offer. It was a delight and the staff again were super accommodating. I will definitely return to this hotel - which I will call my new home in London - very soon!"
July 2019,Fourth Fabulous Milestone Visit from USA,"The Milestone is the essence of English style and graciousness.  Location superb (across from Kensington Palace and Embassy Row), Rooms are elegant (recently renovated with amazing bathrooms on par with Plaza NYC), and Tea in the conservatory is the Best in London.  But what brings us back “home” Again and Again is the staff......a dream team of hospitality experts focused on YOU.  Our favorite server, Grant, has consistently gone above and beyond to enhance our hotel experience—-even to have Chef “whip up” a fresh batch of scones for the kids at 10 PM.  In concierge, Jose and Giacamo are well respected in the city, getting us dinner reservations impossible, even scoring front row theater tickets 1 hr before a show.  This week we received a box from Anna in housekeeping, my…"
August 2019,Birthday weekend at The Milestone,"I travel extensively through work, designing bespoke wardrobe for fine hotels around the world.  We stay at fine properties and meet excellent staff in many hotels. That said, The Milestone stands above all in the effortless sincerity of the staff and their attention to every detail. I cannot put into better verbiage the Impeccable service and friendly disposition that made us feel at home. From the beautifully decorated rooms, each unique, to the Stables bar, to the Butler service picnic in the park....I will be back!"
August 2019,Awesome Hotel,"We've stayed here 4 times in the past 3 yrs.  Hotel is beautiful, rooms are all different and very clean.  Some are typical Euro small rooms, but all we've seen are adequate and with King beds.  Full, cozy bar with excellent, creative bartenders.  Breakfast added to your room rate is worth it.  Onsite restaurant & room service are excellent as well.  (Try the Pot Pie).  The Milestone Staff:  I would give them a 6 out of a 5-Star rating as ALL of them go above and beyond normal expectations.  Trust them to help you with theater, dining and attraction recommendations/reservations.  We usually  take more home than we bring and they're great at shipping whatever doesn't fit in our carry-on luggage back to the US.  Highly recommend The Milestone."
April 2019,London hotel,Lot of hustle bustle with loads of tourists. Stayed there just one night after booking via a hotel app......reasonable. Breakfast was not included but restaurants are reasonable and bar prices are okay for London.
July 2019,Paradise,I booked the hotel for its location and was blown away from the time Steve took our car until he handed it back some three days later. Service was outstanding - décor amazing - quality of food and drink superb - staff exceptional - rooms spacious and luxurious - we seriously thought we had arrived in paradise - have to say a special mention to Steve who greeted us - parked our car and returned it safely and acted as our guide for whatever we wanted.  This will be the first of many visits - Thank you all so much
July 2019,Blown away,"My wife and I travel a lot and only stay at 5-star hotels. Out of all the hotels we have been to in the past, including various Aman properties - which are regarded to be the best in the world - the Milestone Hotel has blown our minds in terms of service quality. From Steve the legendary doorman up to the lovely housekeeping ladies, the front desk staff, concierge, barmen....everyone is so incredibly friendly and kind. This really stood out. The rooms are comfortable, the premises very oldskool but nicely upkept. The Spa is tiny but fine for a city hotel. But the service quality tops anything I have ever experienced, especially in the UK. We were stranded in the UK due to bad weather and were not exactly in the best mood, but the moment we arrived at the Milestone things changed…"
July 2019,Best Hotel Stay in London,"My husband and I stayed on a friends recommendation. It was so lovely and such wonderful staff that we stayed there again, a few weeks later.    Attention to amazing details, makes us want to come back. I loved all the special little things that they do... from precious notes and nice gifts of tea or cookies!   Room upgrades and a great concierge who is a generous wealth of information."
July 2019,21st birthday celebration,"Wow, wow, wow... sadly we have just left the Milestone Hotel following another visit. If you like to go unnoticed (or cared about) in a hotel, then do not stay here. The Milestone is for people who want to feel special ( that does not mean that the service is intrusive). The staff are incredible and make you feel valued and welcomed, each and every one of them.  We have stayed here and at other Carnation hotels. All are great but the Milestone just has something extra special and that is exactly what we wanted for our daughter on her 21st  birthday.  The suites are different styles but both of ours were stunning. Such comfortable beds and pillows, quiet rooms with unobtrusive air conditioning. Sparkling bathrooms with lots of lovely Penhaligon lotions and potions. Great bar…"
July 2019,Milestone hotel,"I do not consider this hotel as five star hotel Great location fabulous breakfast Furniture in the room were old and rusty On the first day we arrived early and we were very tired asked them if they had a room ready they did not say yes or no Keep saying shortly... we waited from 930 to 1 pm We did not mind to get an answer yes or no but they were so unclear My son also found a hair in his breakfast Barely got an apology Beside the receptionists the rest of the service were great twice a day housekeeping  The location is great close to park, train,.. "
July 2019,Charming and superb!,"Fabulous welcome at check-in - included mini tour of the property.  I was extremely late because of traffic and needed a shirt rapidly ironed - this was immediately taken care of.  The room was extremely comfortable with excellent toiletries provided by Penhaligon's.  Bar extremely welcoming, with complementary glass of champagne on the house.  Unfortunately I arrived rather late and left very early to catch my flight, however, I saw enough to very much want to return!"
July 2019,Superior London Hotel,"We stayed at the Milestone Hotel for three nights.  The experience was outstanding.  If you want a definite English hotel experience this is a place to go.  The staff is attentive, thoughtful and caring.  Service was superior.  The rooms are well equipped with modern conveniences.  We could not be happier with our experience and would recommend this hotel without hesitation."
July 2019,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!!","I connected with Katie through the website when I discovered the Wimbledon package offered by The Milestone.  This was a year in advance!  Katie and others patiently emailed me through planning our trip - firming up dates, making reservations, etc. Everything was fabulous. Fran greeted us and gave us a brief tour of the hotel. Teddy took care of our bags. Natalia helped us at the desk and was also the last person we spoke to upon our sad departure. Antonio helped us several times at our meals - including the amazing Afternoon Tea!  Thomas, the bartender, was so attentive to learn and call us by name. And this is how we were catered to throughout. An absolutely lovely experience.  Clearly many of the guests routinely experience this kind of service, but for us, it was a…"
June 2019,Charming Luxury with Outstanding Service,"My family of 4 recently stayed at Milestone Hotel during a trip to London. We had originally booked two rooms but when we arrived we had been upgraded to a residence which had two bedrooms, a living room, kitchen and two bathrooms. The hotel is in a great location in Kensington, opposite the Kensington Palace and a short walk to the tube station. It is a boutique style hotel with very traditional English decor and perhaps one of the most charming breakfast/dining rooms I have ever been in. So pretty but having teenage boys, I could not get them to agree to take any pictures in there. We were very happy with the accommodation, the quality of the fixtures and linens but more than that, the service in the hotel is outstanding. Every person we encountered went out of their way to…"
June 2019,Uncompromised Service Excellence,The staff was memorable. The tea was perfect. The sleep was peaceful. The environment was dreamy.  My team stayed there on a business trip. We began the sessions with exceptional tea and ended them with brilliantly mixed cocktails.  I will never forget my time at the Milestone and will only stay there on future trips to London.  -Nick Ace
June 2019,Anniversary stay -best anywhere ever !!,"Stayed 2 nights as a couple and can only say this was an indulgent treat from start to finish - quite honestly best hotel experience ever ! The hotel is priced higher than we would normally pay however worth every penny . The rooms are individual and stylish in a luxurious way - the dining experience at dinner and breakfast faultless - special mention to Paulo . Food in Chenestons restaurant superb ! However have to mention the Service from staff was unrivalled - all staff from Reception , Concierge , Restaurant and Bar simply could not do enough for us. Location is excellent - I would not hesitate to strongly recommend - cannot wait to go back"
September 2019,Phenomenal stay at The milestone,"My mother and I first visit to London will be a stay to remember because of this wonderful hotel. They treated us like royalty. I cannot wait to come back to stay at this hotel. Everyone here all contributed to our stay but a few names that stood out are Concierge Zdravko and John. They are very charming, professional, caring, and gave wonderful customer service. Anything we needed or asked for we were given or directed to. Very knowledgable about the area. The food was also phenomenal, and the room service was very individualized and made us feel special. Every night we returned back to the room it was fixed with chocolates and rose pedels with wonderful music playing. It cannot get any better than that! I most definitely recommend this hotel!"
September 2019,Excellent stay at The Milestone,"Thank you to Mr. Blake who arranged an extremely nice room for us and made sure we had a great experience at the hotel. We visited The Milestone for both business and pleasure. It was our second time staying there and we had a great experience again. The service was fantastic, from the welcome drinks, to the complimentary fruits and sweets. Natalia checked us in and made sure everything was to our liking and Zdravko was kind to give us a complimentary box of breakfast treats to take to the airport since we had to leave at 5:30 in the morning. The service was exquisite and the staff went out of their way to please their guests. We had a fabulous stay and will definitely be back again! Thank you Milestone!"
September 2019,Charming ,"Our first visit to the Milestone - and it was a real joy. We had an exceptional room and the entire staff was most accommodating. Special kudos to Tim, Tom, Jose, Fran, Zdravko and Natalia for making us most at home and answering to our every need. We enjoyed a high tea and probably won’t eat again for a week. The hotel is right across from Hyde Park and Kensington Palace - so it’s quite convenient to a myriad of places. A special accommodation - we’re so grateful we were led to it! Would recommend it to anyone who wants to have access to a plethora of sights - and sounds. Hope to see y’all again very soon!"
August 2019,The Royal Treatment,My family stopped off in London for a few days on the way back from Greece and stayed at The Milestone Hotel for 4 nights. This was our first time staying at this Hotel and I am now rearranging trips so that we may stop over in London for a couple nights again just to stay at The Milestone.  The location is incomparable as it is across from the beautiful Kensington Gardens (where my husband ran every morning) and Palace. The Hotel's ambience transports you back in time without compromising on present day amenities. The rooms are luxuriously appointed and true to English history with beautiful paintings throughout the Hotel. My boys loved the traditional English breakfast and dinner fare and my husband the Old Fashioned with the aromatic smoke at The Stables Bar. I loved that my…
September 2019,High Tea,"The Milestone was a lovely place for High Tea in the late afternoon.  The atmosphere is absolutely beautiful.  The staff at the Tea were amazing.  Very welcoming and met every single need or request we had.  We enjoyed several wonderful teas and delicious treats.  Everything was absolutely amazing.  Would highly recommend the Milestone.  Now that I have found this gem, I look forward to visiting again and this time staying overnight."
August 2019,The Milestone is Miles Above the Rest!,"Our first night in London we stayed at the Milestone Hotel!  What a wonderful experience!  The rooms were lovely and appointed well.  They might be a bit small, but they make up for that in service!!  The staff could not have been more courteous and truly made me feel like I was home!  Teddy the Doorman was just a delight.  The concierges (I wish I could remember their names so I could give them individual credit!) were absolutely outstanding!  They recommended places to see, local pubs for dinner, and much more and never once steered us wrong!!  If I am in London, I will never stay anywhere else!!!"
July 2019,London getaway,"My wife and I stayed at the Milestone in mid July and had a wonderful experience.  The service was outstanding and I've stayed at plenty of hotels over the years. When we arrived we were greeted at the entrance by the staff who were gracious and attentive. We were given a tour of the hotel which I have never experienced at any other hotel. We were escorted by Fran to our room which was beautifully appointed and the staff left a handwritten card welcoming us to the hotel (very classy). The concierge staff were happy to set us up with tickets for any events we wanted to see. We had a wonderful meal(s) in the hotel restaurant. Champagne Afternoon Tea was a two hour event (a must). Also, we had a romantic turndown service which did not disappoint! When I London, stay at the…"
December 2018,Christmas in London,"The Milestone was lovely in every way. The staff makes one’s stay very personal. It’s a special charming hotel.Great location. Beautifully decorated. We loved gathering for a delicious breakfast everyday. Heading out to enjoy the city, and meeting again in the evening for a perfect cocktail in their little bar. We walked easily to shopping and dining in the neighborhood. We loved everything about the Milestone."
September 2019,Amazing hotel,"I only had the pleasure of staying here for one night as it was an anniversary celebration and we were going to a Proms concert at the Albert Hall and this hotel is about a 5 minute walk away. Stayed in the Meghan Suite. Amazing room, died and gone to heaven type of room. Separate dressing room, massive bathroom and the most comfortable bed. Treated like royalty. Nothing was too much trouble, fabulous staff and treatment. Called us all the time by our surname which made us feel special and it's little touches like this that make this hotel so fabulous. Great bar, great drinks, although we had clearly outstayed our welcome in the bar in the evening as the barman stopped the music, turned the lights on and started yawning.  It was 11.30pm, and we were the only ones in the bar so…"
July 2019,Fantastic F&B Experience - truly London's best hotel!!!,"I was lucky enough to experience the Milestone's Champagne Afternoon Tea with my partner. What an experience. From arrival, Steve the Doorman swiftly assisted with parking our car, even though we were not residents of the hotel, he personally introduced us to the F&B host by name, and they took us to our seat in the Park Lounge.  The Park Lounge is full of charm and character, the ideal setting for Afternoon Tea, with fantastic views of the Royal Kensington Gardens.  Sandra, our Host was ever so engaging, but knew her boundaries and wasn't 'over the top' - which is sometimes the case in top London Hotels. She was natural and seemed truly caring, whilst accommodating our needs efficiently.  The pastries and scones were to die for, and Sandra explained the flavors and options…"
June 2019,The Elegant Hôtel.,"A dear friend recommended the Milestone hotel for our stay in London.  The minute I entered the hotel lobby I felt in love with it. It’s so elegant, full of art pieces and quite.plus it smelled like roses. I was not disappointed at all. I loved the cleanliness, decor, quietness and the lovely restaurant and bar ( the breakfast was so good ) and I had dinner and their lovely restaurant and it was very good. The people working in this hotel are so sweet, friendly, at your service and professional. I would highly recommend this hotel for couples who appreciate the classic English Decor and love ❤️ art work. Thank you 😊 Milestone team for making my visit so memorable.   Maha Alatta.   KSA, JEDDAH  June 2019"
June 2019,"Very polite, professional, kind staff",We stayed at the Milestone for three days and it was nothing short of excellent. We loved our vacation and the staff was especially kind and easy to talk to. Breakfast was wonderful and afternoon tea was excellent. We would love to stay here again!
June 2019,FANTASTIC HOTEL ON EVERY LEVEL!!,"My husband and I spent three nights at the Milestone, and I wish we could have stayed longer. It’s an older, traditional English hotel, and every single staff member that we encountered made us feel like very welcomed guests.  The room was lovely, beautifully appointed with every possible amenity, and the bed was comfortable, too. The turn down service provided wonderful surprises each night!  The breakfasts were huge and fantastic! There was a lovely buffet of fish, cheeses, cereals, fruit, breads and pastries...and then there were full hot choices to go along with that! Everything was served so beautifully, and the staff really aimed to please.  A wonderful experience."
June 2019,The best,"After the long trip to London we were incredibly happy to arrive at the Milestone and find such an amazing  hotel. We were welcomed so warmly, given hot tea, and personally escorted to our room. The food was fantastic and you'll never find a more inviting and charming little bar. The location is perfect and we were able to get around London with ease from there. We cannot recommend it more highly and from our experience it blows away the larger and more well know hotels in the city. We will go back for sure."
June 2019,A Gem in Kensington,"This was our second stay at this lovely hotel. The service staff are all lovely and provide excellent, friendly service. Our room was lovely and cool and we were given a welcome drink. My car was valet-parked by Steve the doorman who also hailed a taxi for us when we wanted to go out. We stayed here as it is only a few minutes walk to the Royal Albert Hall where we were going to a concert. The breakfast is great : a buffet of cold items and cooked-to-order breakfasts. We both had the full English breakfast which was outstanding with eggs cooked any way, a delicious sausage, black pudding, bacon, tomatoes and mushrooms....and bubble & squeak! This is a super comfortable hotel to which we will return."
June 2019,Sheer perfection!!,"Exceptional service and uncompromising attention to detail! We loved every moment of our holiday there, and cannot wait to return! Special thanks to Steve for his lovely pub recommendation and to the team at the Stables Bar for their relentless pursuit of perfecting my favorite amaretto sour. The concierge desk also assisted with my needs for a last minute hostess gift, an emergency fix for my husbands broken glasses, and I could keep going with how helpful they were at every turn. Well done, well done indeed."
June 2019,Best Hotel anywhere,"You will not find better service anywhere than here at the Milestone, just across the street from Kensington Palace. The rooms are all decorated differently, very quaint, with fabric on the walls. Everyone in the hotel is extremely friendly and helpful. We called for coffee in our room, and it came in about 5 minutes. The concierge recommended two excellent restaurants for us. This was our second time staying here, and it will not be the last. Would not stay in any other hotel in London. Highly recommended!"
June 2019,Unbelievable experience!,"A wonderful place to stay.  Enjoyed the rooms and the food!  Service was exceptional.  The staff including Mr. Nik, specifically, was simply amazing.  We even took a photo with the door man.  He was so funny!  Sorry, forgot his name.  The location is fabulous and you can walk to Kensington Palace, Hyde Park and many other attractions.  Enjoyed the walk around that area which is a lot more quieter.  It also about 2 min. walk to the London Tube's Kensington station.  Lots of shopping options around the hotel too.  The evening tea experience was out of the ordinary.  Might want to dress a bit formal but not mandated.  One has to experience it at least once in their lifetime!"
June 2019,Milestone Hotel 6 Star services,"Have traveled the World and stayed in the best places, but this hotel and its staff was above 5 star. we had a mix up with one of our bags and it was left at the port and the Concierge handled the entire situation expertly, efficiently, and politely"
June 2019,Ship to shore,"We ended our 12 day cruise in Southampton and were looking for a central London hotel to transition back to dry land.  The Milestone was the perfect spot.  Located across from the park in Kensington the hotel, provided convenience, comfort but most of all impeccable service.  We arrived mid morning and wanted to maximize our short stay in London.  The room was still being serviced so the staff gave us a key to the spa where we freshened up before heading out.  Room was prepared and bags delivered.  The Milestone is a grand old hotel, with modern conveniences.  The staff is first rate.  And the complimentary cookies are outstanding"
June 2019,The Milestone is special!,"And what makes it so special is the lovely, hard-working staff who exude enthusiasm and exert every effort to assist and please their guests. The neighborhood is fabulous as well as you are central enough to all with the quaintness and charm of the Kensington neighborhood. Our room was spacious and comfortable with every amenity- great products, linen, shower, etc. We loved enjoying an evening cocktail at The Stable bar- (Thanks Angelo and company!) The breakfast is beautiful with lots of choices and we had room service deliver our morning coffee at our request each day. We overheard another guest say that they've stayed at many places in London and now only return to The Milestone and we can understand why."
May 2019,Back again,We stayed in the Royal Studio for 8 nights. The place deserves its high rating. Spacious and elegant. Well trained staff. Excellent location. Can’t wait go back. Convenient to Tube. You will not be disappointed.
May 2019,Only the Best for You,"I'll start with the thing that will make you come back every time you are in London.  Every single person in this hotel wants to make your stay perfect.  They do not make you ask; they ask you!  When it comes to the room, there is just nothing they seem to forget.  With Breakfast added you won't have to eat again for the day!  Superlatives could not do it justice.  You must go to The Milestone yourself.  They will not let you down.  Enjoy the room, enjoy all the little extras, experience afternoon Tea and having a drink in the bar is a cozy romantic must.  Everywhere you turn they provide service with warmth and the pleasant satisfaction that they know how to do it and know you are having a wonderful stay.  I could go on and on.  My wife and I will go back to London just to stay…"
May 2019,Wonderful Wedding Anniversary,"My wife and I had a wonderful Wedding Anniversary for 30 guests in The Windsor Suite.The food and wine were delicious , the flowers beautiful and with friendly , efficient staff the evening was a huge success . Thank you Suzie and Team Milestone !"
May 2019,wonderful boutique hotel,"My first impression wasn't that great.  I didn't love the room first.  My husband requested a quiet room, and that's what we got.  The room was on the top floor overlooking a courtyard.  The windows were smallish and  the ceiling rather low. But the bed was wonderfully comfortable, and it was very quiet, indeed. Every night we received really nice goodies on our pillows.  The stuff was wonderful - not snotty but warm and personable. Breakfast was just outstanding!  One of the best breakfasts we ever had.  The pancakes and french toast were simply outstanding, so were the smoked fish in the buffet and yogurt.  And last but not least was our breakfast waitress .  I think her name was Eleonora.  She lit up every morning with her smile and warmth.  The rooms where breakfast was…"
May 2019,Fantastic On All Counts!,"We recently spent three nights at the Milestone and I wish it had been more. We stayed in the Princess Suite which was just lovely with its French balcony. The bathroom, linens, toiletries, and bedding were all luxurious. There were also some charming extra touches like little snacks every night and printed social cards. The breakfast was more than generous. The hotel is a very charming boutique hotel. What really stood out was the staff. We had a great time with the bartenders who not only mix great cocktails but are also great conversationalists. The concierge staff was excellent and very helpful even before we arrived. When we needed something (e.g. laundry pick up), the staff showed up immediately. Needless to say, the Milestone has become our go-to hotel in London. "
June 2019,Milestone = Marvelous,"I’ve never felt more pampered on a trip to London. Sincere, caring, genuine staff and a lovely hotel. Dining rooms beautifully appointed and quaint at the same time. And within walking distance to just about everything. We loved the Milestone."
June 2019,Excellent in every way,"Old world charm.  Attention to detail. Beautiful towels, bathrobes and silky linens. Excellent concierge service.  Helpful with reservations, directions and travel tips. The staff were courteous, knowledgeable and exceeded expectations.  They have a charming breakfast restaurant with deliciously prepared choices. Located within walking distance of the tube.  Superb experience."
May 2019,"Incredible Hotel, Incredible Staff!",My friend and I spent a week at the Milestone.  It was perfection!  The staff was so kind and attentive and fun!  You could tell that they really wanted you to have a nice time!  Bravo to the Milestone!  My very favourite hotel in a London!  Will definitely be back!!!  Can’t wait!!!❤️
June 2019,Nothing short of perfection,"We, regrettably, only managed a 1 night stay at the Milestone Hotel but it was perfect in every way. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left enjoyed a level of customer service only experienced at the finest hotels in the world.We were impressed by every single member of staff we met but particular praise must go to Pranav Ahuja (Front Office Manager). Pranav is a class act and he epitomises the art of exceptional service. If you are used to staying at higher price hotels do not underestimate the Milestone. If you are more accustomed to a more budget priced hotel the Milestone will prove to be excellent value and worth the extra.    "
February 2019,Beautiful hotel,"Have just returned from a quick one night stay at this lovely hotel. The staff were all exceptionally helpful and friendly and really couldn’t do enough to make your stay enjoyable.   The hotel is truly beautiful, everywhere spotlessly clean and decorated and furnished grandly. Our room had a lovely view over the park. It was furnished beautifully but all the furniture was quite large and took up a lot of floor space which did make it a little cramped. Also the bed, which although very comfortable was extremely high making it quite difficult for my petite mum to get on and off easily without some help. However the very many thoughtful touches and the lovely large bathroom with a plentiful supply of toiletries made it a very comfortable and pleasant stay.   "
February 2019,Magnificent Experience,"First of all, I must admit I am biased to spending time in the RCH Collection of hotels as each has it's own distinct and glamorous experience.  I was staying at Summer Lodge in Evershot and met a lovely couple who recommended the Milestone and I had yet to stay there so I was able to make a reservation at the last minute and the last room and I was so delighted for so many reasons.  It was truly a priviledge to be able to spend two nights at this magnificent hotel with the finest doorman I have ever met who welcomes you with open arms and then you are whisked away to reception where Noola and Tara are there to greet you with warmth and  friendly hospitality.   The team makes you immediately feel at home and nothing is too small or large for them to accommodate. They are so…"
February 2019,A London Gem,"I recently had the opportunity to stay at The Milestone Hotel in London. Having heard about it I was eager to experience to for myself. Located in Kensington, going forward The Milestone Hotel will be my go to property in London. Each and every member of the staff knows your name and the service they deliver is superb. Greeted upon arrival by the Bellmen Stephen or Patrizio, we were made to feel like we had arrived home.  The Concierge Desk is the most professional I have ever worked with and they are indeed knowledgeable about the all things London whether it be transportation, dining or theatre. Shout out to Giacomo, Jose and Timothy( I hope I haven't forgotten anyone). Each morning we were greeted in the dining room by Eleanor who went out of her way to make sure we were…"
February 2019,A Royal Palace well beyond expectations!,"When I generally go to a hotel with a very high ranking, I simply expect that something has to go wrong as I generally believe the grading of my fellow travellers to be way too generous, instead my preconception went completely wrong with Milestone! Everything from the booking, to the special requests, the stay, the staff, the room, the view, the breakfast in the room, the sauna and the gym, all  was simply stunning and perfect!!!! I have no words a just felt like a royal myself! Anyway trying to be a bit managerial and a little bit less carried on by the emotions, I think this management has taken the strategic choice to have a higher number than average of staff and that has as a  first consequence the ability to deliver such a spotless service!  More importantly everybody is…"
January 2019,Special gem of hotel,Wonderful celebration stay at this gem of a hotel in central London!  The team were so helpful and the room was just lovely and comfortable - we all had a fabulous time and night out at the Royal Albert Hall - just along the road - seeing cirque de soleil Totem - very special experience for all - just 10/10 ! 
February 2019,Valentines ,"My other half booked us a night here to celebrate Valentine’s Day ;) wd went to see cirque du Soleil .... ( not their best show ) but it didn’t matter as the hotel was exquisite !! Room was fabulous , best hotel bed we’ve ever stayed in ... just immaculate with gorgeous decor and crisp sheets ... decor was of high standard throughout and the staff are amazing !! Can’t fault a thing . We will be back but for longer than a night !! Great location !! Highly recommend. "
November 2018,Friendly Boutique Luxury.,"I do like to sample new hotels when I stay in London and have been looking at the Milestone for a while. It is wonderfully situated for the shopping on Knightsbridge, Kensington Gardens or the Road Albert Hall. It is small enough to be quite intimate yet large enough to feel like a proper hotel. The rooms are quite small but well appointed and the staff really feel like a big family and do seem to care quite genuinely about the hotel and this is reflected in an excellent level of personal service. The restaurant is small and cosy. We didn't dine but had an excellent breakfast. We were here in November '18 and liked it so much we re-booked for January '19."
February 2019,A wonderful return visit,We stayed here last year and it became our home away from home in London. The hotel is lovely but what takes it to the next level is the people and the service. Everyone knows your name and the warm greetings are sincere. Nothing is too much trouble. Do not miss the Stable Bar!!! A big shout out to my bartender buddies. See you again next year!
February 2019,"They deserve 6 stars! Amazing, warm, nice and professional hotel.","I stayed for a long weekend at the Milestone Hotel for my 50th birthday. Service was spectacular from reservations (thank you Celene) to the concierge (Giacomo who knows the city by heart and has endless patience) and the staff everywhere including Leo and the ladies at the restaurant. I decided to fly on my own and was received warmly. Little treats and a cake expected me in my room (gorgeous and tasty). The experience was fabulous from beginning to end. The hotel is clean, impeccably run - I was asked at to my experience and feedback repeatedly. Last but not least - upon check out I was given a sweet bag of biscuits and a bottle of water for the journey. This clearly proves attention to details. The only challenge I had as a foreigner was that I really did not know how to tip…"
January 2019,Milestone Hotel in London,"We stayed at Milestone hotel for four nights.  We were very impressed with the hospitality and the service we received.  The rooms were fabulously done, and the service was excellent.  The staff all knew us by name, and they went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. They serviced the room twice a day and replenished all the toiletries and left chocolate on the bed every night. Breakfast was included with our room and had a great variety of choices in a buffet style but we also had an option of ordering from a menu (without charge). They also had complimentary drinks when we arrived.  I would highly recommend this hotel whether for pleasure or business. It is very accessible to public transportation (both by bus and tube) and walking distance to many shops.  You…"
May 2019,Well cared for ,"I can not say enough good things about this hotel. I would never stay anywhere else in London. Not only is the hotel beautiful and In an excellent location but it’s the staff that make you feel welcome and cared for.  Our trip was riddled with airport cancellations, lost important baggage and an event that had tickets delivered prior to our arrival. They changed our reservations easily to accommodate or day late arrival. Greeted us when we checked in with such kindness and caring. When luggage was lost the whole staff stepped in to help us. They went above and beyond in assisting us.  Besides the amazing staff and location, the amenities were wonderful. The fitness center, pool, restaurant on site, bar, were enjoyed. The treats in the room were delicious.  I can not thank the…"
April 2019,Best stay in London ,"This boutique hotel is next to the Kensington Palace and has a long history. The decorations are tasteful and also have clear but subtle connection to London itself, including sketches out the Matisse era and paintings of horse racing and tennis game. Occasionally the royal family may come to afternoon tea or dinner. The service is excellent and the concierge desk was very friendly and truly wanting you to have a good time. They helped us planned most of our activities during our stay. The afternoon tea was the best, period. We also enjoyed the daily breakfast - the variety, quality, and service all made a top experience. It’s a place we want to go back again. We had a studio room featuring Matisse sketches and paintings. Everything contributed to an experience that is rich in…"
May 2019,Afternoon tea experience ,"I enjoyed Afternoon tea as solo traveler and what can I say - staff was very welcoming and caring, atmosphere and interior send me a few centuries back in the past and created a needed feeling, and the tea, sandwiches and all sweet cakes were excellent, only problem - too much to try everything 😊"
April 2019,Fantastic hotel and staff,My family and I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights. The hotel is immaculate and the staff are wonderful .  The breakfast was great !  We felt as though we were home being away from home .The rooms are decorated with beautiful Furniture and drapes . The bed linens were wonderful  as well as the bath towels. I have traveled to many places and this is the nicest hotel I have been in . The location is great . The staff was always there to help in anyway .  I would highly recommend “The milestone “!  They also have a small resistance pool in the work out area . My 6 year old granddaughter loved it . You were able to turn on the resistance button or Keep  it as a regular pool.  I would look into this hotel if you  are planning  on going to London L.B  from New Jersey .
April 2019,"Beautiful Hotel, Amazing Service","The Milestone Hotel sets a high standard for service anywhere in the world.   From the person at the door when you arrive with your luggage, who actually seems to be expecting you, to the women who beautifully clean the rooms and leave treats on your bedside, we felt warmly welcomed and pampered by all.  We stayed in standard rooms, which were a nice size and had every amenity you could need.   My request for adjacent rooms was accommodated with no problem.  The beds were very comfortable.  The hotel is in an excellent location, right across from the park and near several Tube stations.  I will definitely return to the Milestone Hotel."
March 2019,Amazing stay,"We stayed here to celebrate our Silver Anniversary. We where very lucky in receiving an upgrade, which was a beautiful split level suit. We attended an event at The Royal Albert Hall, and on returning, spent some time in the bar, then when returning to our room it had the most beautiful romantic turndown, candles and rose petals everywhere. Breakfast amazing, and we dined in the restaurant one evening, which was lovely, great food and staff very friendly. The following two nights of turndowns, where more simple, just a couple of chocolates in a bag on the bed. The only minor niggle, which we didn't report, was that we used a tall tumbler for water on the first day, it disappeared and we never saw it again! Our 2nd night, we had scones left in the room, and while the napkins…"
April 2019,Fantastic experience,"The Sabrage experience was amazing followed by a superb lunch, all of the staff were great but David went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed the whole experience.  Just fantastic day out, if you get chance to do this please do"
April 2019,The Best Stay,"We were privileged to stay at the Milestone for five days during our visit to London. The staff is professional, super friendly, and extremely well trained--whether at the front desk, at tea, in the restaurant, at the bar, the doorman, concierge and housekeeping staff. We were so well taken care of, we didn't want to leave. Our junior suite room was clean, plenty spacious with a view of Kensington Palace and the park"
April 2019,Service with a smile,"Couldn’t fault either the accommodation or the catering, but we were particularly aware that the smiles which accompanied the service were perfectly genuine and could not just be a requirement of a 5* hotel."
April 2019,Perfect,"This was the best hotel ever.  it was brilliant,  luxurious and it was so clean and tidy.   the staff was fantastic and friendly. Outstanding property located directly across from Kensington Gardens. The entire staff was simply incredible... made us feel at home and welcome... quick with a ‘hello’ and a smile... and always accommodating. "
March 2019,Wonderful hotel! Great location!,"I had the wonderful opportunity to spend several nights at this splendid hotel. I have stayed at some of the more well known top end hotels in London that all know, but it was my first time to stay at a Red Carnation branded botique hotel. The Milestone is very cozy and the treatment from arrival to exit is as a family member.  I love the little touches, a candle in the bath  when you return in the evening, the dragons on the sill in the breakfast (at night fine dining) room, the delicious freshly baked cookings when check in. But the real treat is the engaging and friendly staff, who welcome you heartily and make you feel at home from the moment you arrive with the doorman, to the friendly and personalized check in, to the very kind and thorough concierge team that can set up…"
March 2019,The best hotel of our trip!,"On a recent trip to London, Oxford and the Cotswolds, we had the pleasure to stay at The Milestone. It was by far our favorite hotel of this trip! The service was outstanding, the hotel was well appointed and the food was excellent. I recommend it highly."
March 2019,Wonderful Experience,"I had a four nights stay three weeks ago with my family. We enjoyed the best level of deluxe studio in all services. perfect in food and beverage (beautiful scene every night), specially tea hour, typical english. Very good international staff. It seemed a dream..."
October 2018,Fantasic Hotel,"fantastic hotel !!!  This was the best hotel ever.  it was brilliant,  luxurious and it was so clean and tidy.   the staff was fantastic and friendly.   I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone.  What a not great holiday"
March 2019,Afternoon Tea with Children,"My friend and I had afternoon tea with our young daughters while we were visiting London.  The staff was incredibly welcoming and treated our girls like princesses.  The tea selection was wonderful and the food was delicious.  The atmosphere and location were perfect and charming, exactly what we'd hoped for.  When we visit London again, I wouldn't hesitate to return!  I highly recommend an afternoon at The Milestone Hotel!"
January 2019,Outstanding property located directly,"Outstanding property located directly across from Kensington Gardens. The entire staff was simply incredible... made us feel at home and welcome... quick with a ‘hello’ and a smile... and always accommodating. If we could rate the staff and 11, we would"
March 2019,Anniversary Trip,"My husband and I stayed at this extraordinary hotel for 3 nights for an early 30th anniversary trip.  I cannot say enough for the caliber of the staff, from the doorman, housekeepers, front desk and the great concierge staff.  From the minute we stepped into the hotel we were greeted by name.  Mathilda at the front desk was lovely and promised to provided restaurant suggestions for us on our trip to Paris.  On the morning of our check out we found them under our door.  Each day we were left a delicious treat at night.  The highlight were cupcakes made for my husband to commemorate his attendance at a Manchester United match we planned to attend.  I can’t think of any other hotel that has gone above and beyond like the Milestone.  We also loved  Timothy the concierge and his…"
March 2019,Afternoon Tea,"We had afternoon tea here and it was delightful. The staff treated our children like royalty, the food was delicious, and the atmosphere was unbeatable. The location is in the heart of Kensington, which is such a beautiful spot in London. Right across the street from Kensington Palace. Will definitely book here again!!"
July 2018,How it should be everywhere,"Excellent on quality, service etc. Never failing I have now been here twice with my wife without kids and you feel welcomed. Every question is answered to your satisfaction, concierge is great , everything spot on. The whole red carnation group is to be preferred above the big chain hotels. That is off course If you want a charming old school english high quality personalized hotel experience. Thanks for having us and we will be back again. "
April 2018,"A lovely and surprising extension of great personal care by hotel, to guests","I was first at the Milestone in the 1970's, at which time it was not a luxurious hotel, as it is now, rather it was a solid entity, on the #9 Bus route, which would bring you to the center of the city. Across the street are the Kensington Gardens, where Harry and Meghan reside. The milestone now has similar amenities that more famous named and more expensive hotels towards the center of the city.  A good and comfortable place to stay, the presence of a hall porter, a restaurant on premises, and if I remember correctly, a typical ""English breakfast"" offered.  Interesting experience"
February 2019,Defines excellent service,"All those excellent reviews are well deserved. What makes this hotel truly standout is service - everyone is really coming out of their way to be helpful, and management has very well thought-through additional amenities and offers (e.g in flight picnic, help with flight arrangements etc). The property itself is a fine historical building, rooms are pretty though on a smallish side (as it always is in downtown London)."
January 2019,The best London hotel that I've stayed in....by a distance!,"I've stayed in dozens of hotels in London and hundreds around the world....mainly 5* and mainly the upper end of that.  What makes this hotel special is the staff. They are superb. The hotel is gorgeous, very comfortable, has that old-world feel but all the modern gadgets that you need and has some incredible history to boast about, but the staff go the extra mile and then a lot, lot further.  I mentioned that my rugby team was playing on the Friday evening and I got a good luck card with a ""Rugby Bible"" in my room a few hours later. Incredible.  The boys in the small but incredibly cosy bar were superb. Top marks.  The hotel's butler was simply a great source of info and an incredible host. Top marks too.  The staff in the restaurant (both I spoke to were Polish) were great…"
December 2018,Lunch,"Absolutely fantastic hotel, run by people who care about their guests and love their jobs.  A brilliant place to come and be looked after.  We had lunch in a private dining room that has been used by several of the royals!, "
February 2019,Amazing afternoon tea and wonderful staff,"My friend and I went to The Milestone yesterday afternoon and I just had to write about the exceptional service we received from our server Eleanor. She was knowledgeful, polite, informative and could not have done more. As my friend is a vegetarian and I am not, they organised a fully vegetarian stand for us both to pick from, and separated any non-vegetarian sandwiches on to a separate plate. Amazing food, all incredibly tasty and what you cannot finish is boxed up and given you to to take with you. Overall a wonderful experience, with special thanks to Eleanor"
January 2019,Absolutely the best overall high tea in London,"My 22 yo daughter and 18 yo son took our first ever trip to London and my daughter's request was to have high tea.  The Milestone was near our hotel and although it was a huge splurge for a single parent like me, it was absolutely, hands down the high tea experience of a lifetime and one of our favorite meals in London.  Even my 18yo son, who rolled his eyes when I told him we were going, walked away wanting to return, which is no small feat! From the moment you walk in the door, you are impressed with the quiet elegance of this gorgeous, historic hotel.  The library is the perfect backdrop for the most delicious tea service I've ever had, excellent pastries and scones, but the chicken salad sandwiches are simply to die for!  I would be remiss not to mention the incredibly…"
January 2019,Caring staff,"The hotel felt luxurious, comfortable, personal, interesting, the list goes on and on. Most noticably for us, the staff were attentive, personable and couldn't do enough for us. The afternoon tea was delightful and Thomas who served us was absolutely charming. Breakfast was in a light, attractive room where the fire was lit. Again, the staff were personable but not over the top. The Stirrups Bar was cosy and we completely forgot we were in the centre of London."
January 2019,Perfect location for the Albert Hall,"We stayed for one night at this  lovely hotel as we were visiting the Albert Hall for a show. It was a straight, easy, flat 10 minute walk from this hotel. It’s a great location just opposite the wonderful Kensington palace and park. Our room was pleasant even though the decor was a little dated and we faced the back not the park. The small gift and the box of biscuits were a nice touch. The bathroom was very well done and the bed very comfortable.We were very impressed with the young and enthusiastic staff who looked after us so well during our stay. We particularly felt the bar staff were so professional and pleasant when we went for pre show drinks. Later on  when we arrived with our family after the show  there was a lone barman . He was both knowledgeable charming and…"
January 2019,The best hotel in London,Every time I visit — it’s like coming home. Best staff. Amazing food. Best tea in London. Cross the street and visit Kensington Palace. I’ve stayed here on business and with my family and it always inspires. 
January 2019,Just fantastic ,"We were here for our wedding anniversary, for the second time, and were really spoiled by the staff and management again. Last year, owing to works, we had to move to the sister hotel - Egerton House so we have an idea about both. In my opinion The Milestone wins hands down. You’re made welcome at both but The Milestone just seems to fit like a favourite sweater and we feel so very comfortable the whole time we’re there. I doubt we’d stay anywhere else."
January 2019,Fantastic experience made entirely from the staff,"I do not normally write reviews, but a one night stay at the Milestone deserves all the praise for an exceptional service. From the moment we arrived we felt like every member of staff REALLY cared, they were informative and enjoyed a fun banter showing interest in us and the reason for our stay. Afternoon tea served by the delightful Eleanoir, was only to pleased to accommodate the request of a marmite sandwich and green pea sandwich, only as fun but the chef duly obliged round of applause for keeping the customer happy. The hotel states that it aims to provide rooms and accessories as a “home from home” which they achieve in abundance. Cannot praise the staff enough thank you each and everyone"
December 2018,Fabulous boutique hotel ,"My husband and I just checked out of The Milestone Hotel and I wanted to evaluate it on TripAdvisor as it deserves a fabulous review.  If you’re the type of person who appreciates the personalized attention and old fashioned, traditional and more formal atmosphere that a boutique hotel has to offer, search no further. This hotel will be perfect for you. And, it’s location in Kensington is wonderful and convenient.  Our hotel room was extremely well appointed and immaculate. The bathroom was large although our queen sized bed and bedroom were on the small side. But, it was sufficient for our needs and the extreme attention to details and services far outweighed the size of our room.  I honestly cannot say enough wonderful things about this hotel and it’s staff -especially Tim,…"
November 2018,"Health club with Fiona Keane- BEST TREATMENT EVER- jet lag treatment, TRY IT!","This November I had the opportunity to stay at the Milestone alongside my husband over Thanksgiving. The Milestone was a magnificent choice to stay during the holidays, it was cozy, we were well taken care of, and the William and Kate residence is BEAUTIFUL.  The stag was extreme moly helpful and accommodating, even booking us last minute reservations when our fell through on Thanksgiving.  My favorite experience with the hotel was actually the SPA! This was only a 4 1/2 day trip for myself and I was handling the jet lag alright, but my skin was dry and of course my body a little exhausted. I noticed there was a full jet lag treatment which all hotels seem to offer, but I thought why not, it’s a holiday...  This. Was. INCREDIBLE. I actually should have reviewed sooner, but I’ll…"
November 2018,Cannot speak highly enough,"My girlfriend and I initially visited the hotel in early November. Despite having to wait only minutes for our room to be available, we were offered a free drink of our choosing whilst we waited. Nice touch!  After we'd checked in and started to enjoy our stay, I sadly received an urgent phone call regarding the health of a family member. It was so urgent we had to leave immediately having only been at the hotel for perhaps an hour or so. The receptionist (Peggy) and the rest of the staff were extremely understanding and efficient with how they helped us depart. So much so, they didn't charge us for the stay and allowed us to use the night at a later date at no extra charge. Wonderful service.  We rearranged the night for a month or so later, and as to their word allowed us a…"
December 2018,Great hotel fab location ,"What a delight to stay here. The staff, decor, room, all perfect. We stayed in the sister hotel 41 recently as it was voted no 1 hotel to stay on trip advisor and we found this far better. Great location for exploring, lovely afternoon tea too. We would def stay here again "
November 2018,"Our special ""home"" in London",We love this hotel.  What a very special place.  We are made to feel so welcome by all the staff and this special care continues throughout our stay.  The bedrooms and suites are all unique and everything about them is first class - from the bedding to the amenities to the room service and housekeeping.  We never want to leave.  The breakfasts are amazing - anything you could possibly wish for and we also enjoy dining in the restaurant for lunch or dinner. We are looking forward to returning next Summer.
December 2018,Another PERFECT visit. Attention to detail still impressive,"We were at the Milestone back in May of this year and we just could not wait to return. This time we brought along some friends to see this charming hotel with world class service. As always, this hotel never disappoints. Service and charm is consistent and world class. There are a lot of lovely 5 star, triple diamond hotels around but then, there is this hotel, the Milestone. ""World class"" is still not good enough to describe the hotel and the people who work there. The attention to detail is so scary, I love it! Just amazes me how the staff do what they do on a day to day basis. Special shout out to Giacomo and Angelo who were the bartenders when I was there in May and is still there today. They are just AMAZING and I love just talking to them and getting to know them. We so…"
December 2018,Amazing hotel,"One of the best I have ever visited. Very clean rooms, amazing food quality and most important the most welcoming staff. Amazing location facing the Hyde Park.  It simply makes you feel home away from home. "
October 2018,Perfect in every way,"I stayed at The Milestone with my parents and brother. All of the employees greeted us by name and made us feel so welcome and comfortable. Each of the rooms had unique decor, but always lovely. The breakfast was truly a stand out. It is served in a beautiful fireplace room and nearly everything you could imagine was available on the menu. I really enjoyed everything about our stay at this quintessential British hotel!"
December 2018,Spectacular!,"Outstanding customer service, beautiful surroundings and delicious food, what more could you wish for from a hotel?   We hosted an evening wedding and reception in the Milestone Hotel and everything was truly magical, we really couldn’t wish for anything more.    Our every need was catered for and nothing was too much trouble. All members of staff were professional, helpful and friendly.   Celene, our contact from initial enquiry and throughout the preparations was a dream to work with and organised everything to perfection.   Another key member of the team was Leo Forte, a charming man who will go far in the hospitality industry, he ensured everything ran smoothly on the night and was on hand the following morning to assist with the departure of our guests from the hotel.  …"
December 2018,Exceptional hotel,"What do you want from a hotel? Think really hard, close your eyes, make a wish, tap your heels together three times and, hey presto, The Milestone appears in front of you.   There’s nothing I can add to other positive reviews. This is simply the best hotel I’ve ever stayed in. Good, old-fashioned customer service at its finest. Treat yourself. You won’t be disappointed. Exceptional."
December 2018,"One week trip to London, filled with sight seeing and exploring.","Our stay at the Milsetone Hotel exceeded our expectations! The entire staff was so welcoming and helpful. The Concierge staff was superb. Our room was comfortable and very well appointed.  Breakfast each morning was perfect with a wide assortment. We had dinner one night at the hotel and it was a delicious meal with exceptional service. The location of the hotel was a definite plus. We were within short walking distance to the underground railway, nice restaurants, shopping, Hyde Park and Kensington Palace We recommend this highly and are looking  forward to going back. We cannot say enough positive about the Milestone Hotel and they way we were treated."
January 2019,Magical!,"We stayed here for a week over the Christmas period. Truly a magical stay. The hotel per se is lovely but it is the service which makes it world class. The whole staff goes the extra mile to make your stay a memorable one. Special mention to the bar staff.  Rooms are of high standard, food is excellent, gym/spa area is small but functional. Lots of little treats such as chocolate were offered to us each day, and we also received Christmas presents! Thanks to all and can’t wait to be back! "
December 2018,"Great Hotel, Outstanding Staff and Incredible Location!","We stayed at The Milestone Hotel from 22-26 December for a Christmas break in London and the facility and staff truly exceeded our expectations. The hotel's location, directly across from Kensington Gardens, was incredibly convenient. Our room (305) was spacious, quiet and very comfortable (kudos for one of the best hotel mattresses we've ever experienced). Hats off to Steve, Pedro, Magda, Patricio, Raul, Mathilde, Tara and the rest of the Milestone team for making us feel incredibly welcome and 'at home' during our stay."
December 2018,"Cozy, Convenient, and Convivial","A small hotel on High Street Kensington on the southwest edge of Kensington Gardens offers convenience to the parks, tube station, and posh shopping.  The atmosphere is more like ""home"" than ""hotel.""  Yes, rooms are small by American standards, but more than adequate and are in excellent condition. The service staff are very friendly, responsive, and attentive.  For example, I bought a book, laid it on my bedside table - the turn down service inserted a Milestone bookmark for my convenience.  Each evening a new taste treat was laid on our pillows.  A newspaper started each day. During our stay we both had a bout of stomach bug - the staff responded with medications, ginger ale and ice without our asking.  The restaurant and bar have a strong menu for such a small property.  We…"
December 2018,Beautiful afternoon tea ,Gorgeous afternoon tea home made scones and pastries. Fab choice of teas and lanson champagne all in a stunning setting next to Kensington palace what more can you ask for! Restaurant looks smashing too. 
December 2018,Great service but spa disappointing ,Old fashioned charm of an English Hotel. It was very cold in London when I visited and the down stairs area were not warm. The Spa area is a disappointment and the bar was small and quirky. The service and friendliness of the staff was memorable. 
December 2018,Most wonderful hotel. ,"I agree with all the great reviews.  The Milestone is several cuts above the others.  The hotel is lovely, rooms very smartly appointed, etc.  But it is the staff and the little things which really set this apart.  From the moment you walk into the beautiful lobby, everyone calls you by name.  They not only tell you where to get the bus but walk out the front door to show you.  The sweets on the pillow are different every night.  The small gifts upon arrival, the welcome cocktail, the wonderful bar tenders who explained the fancy drinks they were making, the wonderful breakfast ( included and fabulous), the twice daily total maid service- everything is above first rate.  Don’t miss tea by the fire, champagne in the bar, or the lighted candle on the bathtub at night.  All…"
December 2018,"'No request too large, no detail too small'","My fiancé and I came to stay for one night and we had one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had. This quaint, cosy hotel offered tiny details at every turn and, at Christmas anyway, we felt as if we were staying in a perfect little dolls' house!  We were offered a glass of bubbles upon arrival, and the check in (and out) service was quick and efficient and the staff were extremely warm and helpful. Fortunately, our room had been upgraded and we were given a suite with a corner sofa living area. Looking at my photos, you would've thought we were there for many nights, but all of these tiny touches were placed in our room and throughout the hotel within one night! The bed was comfortable and I had a lovely bubble bath!  We were out at an event in the afternoon, but we…"
December 2018,Warm and welcoming luxury - fantastic!,"We stayed for 1 night in a junior suite (The Viscount Suite) and it was without doubt one of my best hotel experiences ever.  Some of the highlights:  + The Viscount Suite is stunning; beautifully furnished and decorated, spacious and with lovely views of Kensington Palace. The four-poster bed was fantastic. Several seating areas.  Beautiful paintings. There was also a big group of orchids. Huge TV. Snacks/nibbles provided for arrival and after turn-down.  + Excellent staff, especially the doormen and in the bar. We were always addressed by name by the doormen throughout our 1-night stay, very impressive. Everyone always met us with a smile and a very warm approach.  + I had quite a few parcels sent to the hotel in advance of our stay. This was handled perfectly.  + Top-quality…"
October 2018,Family hotel,"This is the best hotel i stayed in my life, all the staff in the hotel are very friendly and they welcome you when you arrive at the hotel. you feel like home, i always feel that i am at home with the family. Its both a family and a business trip hotel. all the staff treat you as a person not as a number in the hotel. and they always try to help you if you have any issues. i recommend if you go to London to stay at the milestone hotel. the hotel is like a 7 star hotel, and is always the best."
October 2018,Gorgeous Hotel,This fabulous hotel had impeccable service. Beautiful rooms. Lovely service. Small but functional gym. Scones and treats brought nightly to the room. Also loved the library and all of the different sitting rooms. 
September 2018,The Cheniston Room at the Milestone Hotel,"I regard this as one of the best restaurants, if not the best restaurant, in London. It has a bar very well stocked with premium spirits and an excellent barman. The restaurant is quiet and the food and service are of a very high standard. It is the only London restaurant I have found at which one can get a madeira after dinner."
October 2018,Dad and Daughter High Tea ,"This was a lovely place for high tea. It is pricey. But i had a great time and experience with my daughter. We had the traditional tea service, selected two different teas, were treated to traditional sandwiches, pastries and the best scones baked to order I have ever had. The tea area is small but oh so cozy. We were never rushed and stayed and bonded for almost three hours. Its right across from Kensington gardens where we wandered to after for a nice walk. This was very good."
August 2018,Superstar Service,"I been stayed at milestone hotel in Kensington. It was a great experience. Service was excellent. Housekeeping ""Maria Caldeira"" did a great service. A big thanks to Maria. My wife was so happy.  Thanks milestone team for a wonderful service.   "
September 2018,"Great Small Hotel, Great Location","We recently spent 9 nights at the Milestone Hotel in Kensington, London. We could not have been more pleased; with one exception I'll discuss shortly. The hotel is right across the street from Kensington Palace so from our room we had a view of parkland, Although we were on the 4th floor the windows were so well insulated that traffic on Kensington High St. was inaudible. We were in the Viscount suite which was large and charmingly decorated with victorian period  furnishings including an exceptionally comfortable, massive four poster bed. The one problem was the bathroom. Beautifully decorated with stylish colors-it was in our opinion too small. In addition, and we had been warned, there was no separate shower, plus the access to the tub/shower was not easy for a mobility…"
September 2018,All hotels should treat you this way,"From the time we entered the hotel we felt at home.  Each staff member was willing to do whatever was necessary to make sure our stay exceeded expectations.  The common areas were always full of fragrant floral displays, our room was clean, comfortable and up to date.  Breakfast was included in our stay.  Each morning the staff was wonderful and the food plentiful and delicious.  Well located for west enders right across the street from Hyde Park and close to the tube if you choose public transportation versus a cab.  If this works for you location and cost wise this is a place to try."
September 2018,MadameKK,We had an excellent  champagne afternoon tea. We love the scones.Very friendly staff. Great with the children. The girls had their princess and decorated their own cup cakes. Very nice ambience. We will be back!
September 2018,New favourite!,Stayed in September. Was so impressed by the hotel and in particular the service. Each and every member of staff were very caring and passionate about the hotel and proud of the property. The place is very traditional and charming and the team really went the extra mile to ensure the stay was perfect!
September 2018,Beautiful hotel with the beautiful staff and the best dog-friendly hotel,"I took my little dog to treat ourselves for a couple of days. All the staff were so friendly and nice to my dog, who had everything she wanted in the room including yummy dog room service! She also enjoyed running in Hyde Park so the location was perfect too! The second night was my birthday and I got a lot of beautiful cakes etc. from the hotel. We enjoyed every minute of our stay there and would definitely come back!"
March 2018,Overlooks Meghan and Harry's Castle,"Every room and suite in this elegant boutique hotel is different--and charming-- plus the view from some is of Hyde Park and Kensington Palace, where Prince William and Prince Harry and their families reside. Love the antique furniture, myriad of paintings and especially the cozy bar with its life-sized jockey attired in silks, an homage to when this building served as a stables for the palace."
October 2018,"Exceptional, refined luxury",The best asset of a company is arguably your staff.  Well get prepared for an exceptional and warm welcome from the Milestone Hotel.  Not only are they warm and welcoming but they simply cannot do enough for you to ensure a phenomenally enjoyable stay.  Check in was effortless and we were shown around so we could achieve maximum value from the stay.  The Hotel is spotless and the room certainly didn’t disappoint.  The bed was very comfortable and almost everything you need is in the room including a spacious bathroom.  I didn’t have an iron which would have been useful but maybe if I had asked it could have been done quickly.  Breakfast was delicious with the usual array of wholesome breakfast foods in a plentiful buffet.  Hot food is ordered and was very good including the…
July 2018,Not just a hotel but a home,"We had an extended stay experience at the Milestone Hotel during the month of July in one of the newly renovated residences with our family of 5.  This was our second trip to the Milestone hotel.  Our first was in 2015 and after a short four days we knew we couldn't wait to return.   In finding out we had a long stay in London, we were pleased to learn about the residences.  We had the benefits of lots of space, a kitchen (actually 2) and washer dryers (2 of those too!) while still getting to experience the wonderful service and amenities that the hotel had to offer.   Our stay could not have been better.   The room was perfect, the location was perfect (across from the park for morning excercise and close to the tube), and the service was above and beyond.   The staff truly…"
September 2018,Stately Hotel,We spent two nights at the Milestone Hotel and had two adjoining rooms.   From the moment we arrived we felt very welcomed.   We were shown our rooms and the hotel common areas along with breakfast room.    We were offered a complimentary drink in the conservatory with snacks.   Our rooms were beautifully designed with very clean bathrooms stocked with an assortment toiletries.  We took advantage of tea service in the afternoon which was delightful.  So many choices!!!   Travelers should take note that a 12% tip is automatically included on your bill in the bar and tea room.  This is totally acceptable but if you are normally tipping 20% on the table you might find it helpful to know ahead.  All very trustworthy staff which were kind and helpful.  Lastly we need to mention the…
September 2018,"It's the best, but always goes above and beyond","I've raved about The Milestone Hotel on this site before, and didn't figure I had to gild the lily with a second rave, but here I am.  We get to London two or three times a year, and our trip month last month was to meet up with friends to help celebrate the 25th anniversary of Ffiona's Restaurant just over on Kensington Church St. (see big ol' rave review of Ffiona's) and our dear friend Ffiona Reid-Owen.  Of course we booked The Milestone, arriving unusually early in the a.m. -- who knew airlines and London transport could be so efficient? -- and, as you might expect, were greeted with the standard, ""We're so sorry no rooms are ready yet.""  I can get pretty petulant, but my wife persuaded me to be an adult and have coffee in the hotel library, not unload on the desk staff at…"
October 2018,Fab Afternoon tea!,"We didn’t stay at the Milestone Hotel, but stopped in and saw their lovely tea room, so made a reservation.  We loved it!  The room is intimate and charming, the staff are so friendly and accommodating, the food was delicious!  We had the Royal Tea with champagne which made it even more festive.  There’s an excellent selection of teas, too.  It was a very relaxed setting.  Will definitely go back next time we are in London!"
August 2018,World-class Hotel,"We recently had the privilege of spending three nights at the Milestone.  Everything was truly outstanding.  The rooms were more than comfortable and the staff could not be better.  Absolutely everyone we had contact with, from the doorman, front desk and concierge, to the waiters and bar staff, were among the most helpful and genuinely friendly we have encountered at any hotel.  The attention to details such as providing a different small treat in our room every day, lighting a candle in the bath during the evening turn-down service, and even wrapping the cord to our cell phone charger with a small Velcro tie they provided, put them in a category far above the ordinary.  We're looking forward to returning to the Milestone the next time we are in London."
September 2018,One of the best!,"Couldn’t say anything negative. Luxury service, beautiful rooms, great hotel indeed! I love the antique decor, it looks very luxurious.  We will definitely come back the next time we visit Kensington again."
September 2018,Incredible Hotel and Staff,"I had the pleasure of spending four days in this lovely hotel. We had Afternoon Tea in the Park Lounge that was marvelous, and the service was top notch. We greatly enjoyed the appeal of the Stable Bar in the hotel and spent time there relaxing at the end of the day. The Milestones location if fantastic and has great restaurants like the Cheneston with in their hotel, and more in walking distance."
October 2018,The Milestone is a Treasure,"We have stayed in many lovely hotels all over the world, for our business and for our personal travels as well.  The Milestone is without a doubt our favorite hotel we have ever stayed in! Staying for about a week gave us a mere taste of the graciousness of their staff, their dining experiences, and lovely rooms.  So much so, we can’t wait to return to London for a second visit to stay @ The Milestone again.  We were absolutely taken with London and the countryside as well. Our 25th anniversary celebration in UK/London could not have been more delightful. The Milestone is a Treasure to behold!"
October 2018,Afternoon tea ,"We went to this hotel for afternoon tea and I have to say it was absolutely marvellous! The service was impeccable and we were predominantly looked after by David. He made us feel very welcome and we wanted for nothing, another stomach would have been helpful.  Great tea selection with champagne on offer if we had wished to indulge but to be honest I prefer beer. I selected the Assam tea, the others Darjeeling and Afternoon Tea. All delicious.  Great sandwich and cake selection plus scones which were freshly baked for us while we ate the cakes and sandwiches.  Scones arrived nice and warm.  Would definitely recommend this hotel for afternoon tea. "
July 2018,Trip down memory lane,"This was a much anticipated and long overdue return visit to this incredibly special hotel. It was a joy to find that everything was just as we remembered it - best described as a country manor house in the heart of London, full of olde world charm and impeccable hospitality. We couldn’t have wished or asked for more from our visit, with every effort to make our visit an enjoyable one - we have fallen in love with the Milestone all over again and cannot wait to return again very soon. A special THANKYOU goes out to Grant, food and beverages manager, whose genuinely warm welcome, generosity of time and attention to detail made our visit a truly memorable one. This is an absolute must for anyone wanting a fine dining experience with first class service in beautiful surroundings."
July 2018,Very Special High Tea,"My family had a very special high tea at the Milestone today. From the minute we walked in the door all the staff, especially Tim, made us feel so welcome. They went out of there way to ensure my daughter had a great time. The food and service was excellent. I would highly recommend to anyone!"
July 2018,Make you feel welcomed and comfortable,"The staff was very welcoming and professional.  Pedro and Jose went above and beyond their duties to accommodate, as did the rest of the staff.  Room was clean and comfortable, good location to walk around and see the sights!"
June 2018,Luxury in Abundance,"The Milestone hotel is a wonderful gem! Just across from Kensington Palace/gardens, you cannot ask for a better location, and within easy access to the tube to explore other areas in London. From the moment you arrive, you are treated like royalty. Your every need is anticipated by the staff before you even realize you have one. Our room was delightful, and every evening there was a little gift at turndown service. It's those small details that made our stay amazing. No 2 rooms are alike, they each have their own charm and personality, something I truly enjoy.  A huge thank you to Andres, Fran, Nik and Magda for going the extra mile, time and again to make our stay the best one yet in London. We will surely be back!"
July 2018,Amazing hotel and the perfect venue for an intimate wedding,"My wife and I decided the Milestone would be our perfect venue to get married in a small ceremony with our closest family. It didn't disappoint in any way. We have both stayed in top end hotels before but the service and genuine care taken by Milestone staff is unparalleled.  Everything was perfect on the day, all the little details they took care of made it a very special occasion. Every member of staff was brilliant, the food was amazing and the rooms were faultless. Every member of our families felt the same and none of us can speak highly enough of the service we received. We expected big things but even those were surpassed.  In short, whether it is for your wedding, a holiday or just a one-night stay, we highly recommend this wonderful hotel!"
February 2018,Lovely weekend in London,"I stayed here with my little girl on a half-term trip to London. The hotel is beautiful and the staff are simply the best. A nice added touch was that they all had learned our names and greeted us personally whenever we went in or out. We had high tea in the restaurant - one kids and one adult, though we could have probably both shared the children’s version and been stuffed! (They did helpfully box it all up and take it back to the room for later.) The cakes and little sandwiches are just amazing and we also did the cupcake decorating. The lady who helped us was very patient with my little girl, who wanted to make the tallest cupcake ‘in the world’, which was quite a slow process. :) There are games and bits you can borrow from the hotel. I phoned down to ask for Scrabble and…"
February 2018,A great hotel,"I have stayed there twice, and it is a very good hotel. It is very well run with good service and an attentive staff.  It is also in an area with good walking to shops, restaurants, hair sales and even palaces :)"
July 2018,Absolutely outstanding,"I stayed here with my family after the hotel came highly recommended by my parents. I was extremely impressed with the service from the moment we walked in. We were greeted every time we walked in and out of the lobby. The building and the apartment were GORGEOUS, the amenities endless - not to mention the basket of treats and wine left by the hotel! The hotel is conveniently right across from Kensington Palace and Hyde Park, and down the street from a tube station and Royal Albert Hall. I left some items behind after returning to the states, and within an hour of calling the concierge, he had made arrangements to ship them back. I was blown away by the kindness and friendliness of all the staff; they always went above and beyond to make us feel safe and welcome. The staff even…"
July 2018,Simply the best,"We stayed here as a couple last fall and brought back our kids this summer so they could  also experience London and the tremendous Milestone. 6 of us, all adults stayed in the 3 bedroom residence, each with its own bathroom. BEAUTIFULLY decorated, comfortable and as always we were once again blown away by the incomparable service and staff. So lovely to have a small kitchen to use, and the lounge area was perfect to gather and enjoy each other's company after a long day of exploring. The location is absolutely perfect -  literally across the street from Hyde Park and Kensington Palace, 5 minute walk to the Tube station, and a comfortable walk to Royal Albert Hall and the V&A museums.Our breakfast each morning in the dining room was phenomenal. Even when there was one tiny…"
June 2018,There are Five Star Hotels than there is The Milestone Hotel,"Everyone that works in the hospitality industry should stay at The Milestone Hotel because that is how it is done.  From check in to check out this hotel is nothing short of outstanding.  The staff is pleasant and always willing to help assist you in any way to make your stay five stars. From the doormen to the front desk to the maid service everyone is professional and friendly and made me feel right at home.  Located close to the subway, Hyde Park and the legendary Royal Albert Hall this hotel is close to everything you need during your London visit.  I also ate at Cheneston's Restaurant and my meal was one that I will not soon forget.  I enjoyed my time in London and staying at The Milestone Hotel made it even more memorable."
May 2018,Best hotel  in London ,"The Milestone Hotel is in my opinion the best place to stay in London. Everything from the welcome we received , to the food we ate ,  to the beautiful rooms we had the pleasure of staying in was faultless and absolutely excellent. We were treated like royalty and cannot wait to go back . The afternoon tea is exceptional and so is the breakfast. I would 100% recommend this wonderful hotel . "
May 2018,Today's Royal Wedding Giveaway!,"By Gods Grace,   I was 1 of 5 lucky winners on the Today show picked to attend the Royal wedding in London, and to stay at the breathtaking, exceptional customers service, and overall Gem .   The head of the opulent 56 all suite luxury hotel is Andrew... He always greeted you with the biggest smile, warmest hugs, and loudest laughs. There never was a no during a stay, simply more so ""let make that happen"".    We experience only the best of the best... From Caviar sandwich's and English Tea at High Noon, Triple Chocolate Ganache, with raspberry mousse on the side. etc etc etc...   Wake up calls came with Fresh hot tea , shortbread and a sweet note... One of the very personal touches that I love about this place is all the fresh flower... Most of all the flowers are Red , but you…"
May 2018,Likely to Return,"London is so big that often your choice of hotel is determined by what part of it you plan on visiting. This is in a prime location for luxury tourism, at the corner of Kensington Gardens. All the top stores and many top restaurants are within 1 mile. Of course you have Princess Di’s Kensington Palace across the street.  We liked the hotel’s small scale and cozy, intimate feel. But no expense has been spared. The room was sumptuously furnished and very quiet.  The staff is enormous and well trained. That said, they neglected to clean our room one day until we returned and brought it to our attention. And what was the point of inquiring at check-in whether I would like a newspaper and then not delivering one?  The breakfast offered a big menu in addition to a large buffet. We did…"
May 2018,Fantastic hotel,"I visit london for work regularly and I stay at many hotels in the city and this one is a really amazing one. I love the boutique hotel design and the decorations has  a clear personality, details everywhere, refine luxury with a distinctive British stile. Amazing rooms !!! The service is also amazing and the food experience was also incredible. I will be back for sure "
May 2018,"Sumptuous Surroundings, Incredible Staff, Perfect Location",We recently visited and were so delighted with everything about this beautiful property. Can't say enough good things about the staff; concierges were friendly and knowledgeable; wonderful historic building; lovely buffet or full breakfast; delicious meals attentively served; exquisite decor throughout with every convenience; black and white conservatory is stunning; located directly across from Kensington Gardens and Palace and convenient to much of London's sights.  We can't wait to go back.  Many thanks to each and every one who made our stay so perfect!
May 2018,An Amazing Experience,"From the minute I arrived at the MIlestone the staff treated me like family and went out of their way to make me feel comfortable. They rushed my room so I could get in mid day, brought me tea and offered to do anything they could to make me more comfortable. I thought this impeccable service was just a lovely way to greet me but it lasted all four days I stayed there! Every morning a latte was delivered to my room and wherever I went in this very charming boutique hotel someone was there to lend me a hand! I can not recommend this hotel enough if you are going to London. I have stayed at many lovely spots but The Milestone really takes the cake! The room was well appointed and so comfortable. It was very difficult to leave. Honestly the finest experience I have ever had in…"
April 2018,Stay in London,My wife and I recently stayed at the Milestone Hotel for about a week while in London. The entire hotel staff was terrific and the stay was great. This is a class hotel - the restaurant was 5 star and I would highly recommend if you are looking for a romantic white table cloth evening. One highlight were the best martinis we had ever had at their bar - we actually wrote back and  they gave us their recipe. If you are looking for a memorable visit stay at the Milestone.
May 2018,"Beautiful, great location, fabulous staff",My wife and I have experienced a number of other 5 star hotels in London and we choose to keep coming back to the milestone.   It is thoughtfully and beautifully decorated maintaining the character of the hotel.   The staff are welcoming attentive and go to great lenghths to make you feel special and your visit perfect.  The luxury king and delux studios are both nice with the studio having more space.  It has a great location directly across from Kensington palace/park.  We look forward to our next trip.
May 2018,Fabulous facility and staff,"We recently enjoyed four nights at the Milestone, and enjoyed every minute. The staff is incredibly friendly and proefessional. The breakfast food and service was superb. They went out of their way at every turn to ensure our stay was memorable. True luxury across the board!"
May 2018,Exceptional experience in an hotel filled with class,"The Milestone was filled with character, class and a quality second to none. Everything was tastefully done with each part of the hotel promoting the aforementioned. The variation in the rooms offered created a choice for the client which catered for everyone's needs without compromise. The staff were also excellent across the board with any request being dealt with efficiently and with an air of friendliness-nothing was too much trouble. We were upgraded from the luxury king room to a delux studio which was great. We are now about to book another stay in August."
April 2018,"Charming, discreet and excellent red-brick 5-star in Kensington","As the final “leg” of a “bucket-list” road trip of the UK West Country, I had decided to spend 3 nights in London at a 5-star property to conclude my 3 week odyssey in the lap of luxury.  I wont even mention the half dozen or so of the usual suspects that entered my head but, when thinking of what I hoped to achieve during these final days, I realised that re-visiting my old stomping grounds of Notting Hill & Kensington where I had lived in a flat (in NH) for several years during the mid 70s whilst working in London was going to be my #1 priority. There were, of course, many options in the area including some big-name modern-ish places but I was determined to stay in a hotel which typified the red-brick classic charm of a traditional late 19th century, established property.  The…"
April 2018,A home you wouldn’t want to step out. Be treated like royalty.,"We spent a few nights in the Paris Suite at The Milestone Hotel and Residences. The suite was luxurious with well thought through touches. Nothing was missed out. Our charging cables were all over the place and Housekeeping velcroed them tidy.   The Penhaligon toiletries were fabulous and upon checking in a butler came to our room and offered a selection of Crabtree & Evelyn full sized body soaps to use during our stay.   There were two bathrooms in the room. One fitted with a WC, bathtub and two wash basins and another with a shower and WC. The bedroom window overlooks Kensington Park and Palace.    I like the resistance pool and gym in the basement. It is also where the spa is.  Two private showers are located here and L’occitane toiletries with plush towels and bedroom…"
April 2018,Brilliant London retreat,"Wonderful hotel and staff in a lovely part of London, ideally located for Kensington Palace, Hyde Park and the Royal Albert Hall with Harrods only a 20 minute walk away or 5 minutes by cab. Great local restaurants and cafes."
April 2018,Indescribably Wonderful!,"Words almost escape me when thinking about my stay at The Milestone Hotel last week.  The opening welcome from the doorman set the tone for a fantastic stay. Each staff member really outdid themselves to extend that welcome throughout our 5 day trip.   The food in the dining room and my single experience with room service was delicious. Overall the service was quiet, effortless and excellent.  The Milestone is located across the street from Hyde Park and we looked across at Kensington Palace from our 5th floor room.   I would stay again in a heartbeat and will recommend to all my friends who visit London."
April 2018,Fabulous hotel!,The Milestone Hotel is in a wonderful location away from the hustle bustle of Piccadilly but a short cab ride to all the major attractions.  It is located across the street from Kensington Palace and the lovely gardens of Hyde Park. A boutique hotel filled with old world charm.  The staff is outstanding and ready to help with anything you might want or need.  Great concierge service too.  The breakfast room is delightful and the food delicious.  Did not have the Afternoon Tea but it is in the charming sitting room and looked lovely.  Rooms comfortable and well appointed.  A definite place for your next stay in London!!
April 2018,Magnificent Milestone!,"Not only are the rooms and restaurants exceptionally beautiful but the staff is the best I've ever encountered. Tim, Connor, Laura and especially Waddie are so gracious, thoughtful, accommodating and professional. I love this hotel and if not staying here I will make a point to stop in to say ""Hello"" to the outstanding staff."
April 2018,OUTSTANDING,"The most incredible experience ever.  What fabulous staff.. thank you to Leo, Peggy, Nuala, Nik, Connor, Tim, Giacomo times two, Angelo, Wadie , Jose and Steve and the whole team... NEVER HAVE WE EVER ... can’t wait to come back. We have stayed in some magnificent hotels in our lifetime. Some 7 star rated hotels and the MILESTONE far surpasses any of those experiences. HIGHLY RECOMMEND it..."
April 2018,No complaints,"Friendly helpful staff, quiet clean rooms and good food, near to museums and galleries,  decent transport links to central London and further afield. The area has lots of shops and restaurants nearby and is interesting to walk around."
April 2018,Perfect a Second Time,"We stayed at this hotel last year and when we decided to go back to London, The Milestone was the natural choice.  The service provided by the hotel staff is far superior to any previous experiences.  They greet their guests by name and are always willing to be of service. The staff is the epitome of graciousness and professionalism.  The rooms are lovely and very clean and well kept.  The location is great, with many fine restaurants near by. We hope to return."
March 2018,I am in love with this hotel!,"Milestone is one of the rarest and most beautiful hotels in Kensington. It is charming, unique, atmospheric and top quality. I have been coming here on different occasions for many years and I also experienced the afternoon tea. I can say that the staff in the hotel is absolutely wonderful. They make you feel at home, very cosy, appreciated and looked after. I remember the lovely lady called Malina and a gentleman Augustine. What I love especially is the pianist Malcolm who plays wonderful music in the evenings. It is a true pleasure to be at this hotel! A wide selection of teas, food dishes, drinks and everything you can dream of. Very worth visiting if you want a sense of comfort, luxury, old English style and impreccable service. Thank you!"
May 2018,Classy,"We came in late one night for cocktails, and left very satisfied, wish we had come earlier.  Waiting staff were very friendly, and made us feel at home, putting on music and chatting with us.  Would love to come back soon."
May 2018,Wonderful Experience,"The Milestone Hotel is a true gem.  The hotel and staff are second to none.  The service was perfect.  Leo, Laura, Angelo, Giacomo were outstanding.  Everyone gave such personalized attention to me that at times I felt like the only guest.  Keep up the great work! Sam"
April 2018,Perfection,"It is obvious from the moment you step from the car that the staff here strives for perfection and it is achieved! Beginning with the butler, Francis, who was charming and utterly welcoming. We loved our quiet room with the spacious bath. The breakfast was absolutely outstanding with wonderful service from Sandra. In the evenings the bar was small, but so much fun!! Watching the cocktails get mixed was such a fun show, try the ‘Smokey Old Fashioned’, wow! Need a great black taxi? Steve is your man! This doorman is the employee that puts this lovely, lovely hotel above all others! We had the most wonderful 6 night stay here, fabulous!"
May 2018,A Lovely Place in London,"We spent 2-9 May at the Milestone in room 408.  Milestone is one of the best hotels we have stayed in 39 years of travel together.  It was indeed perfect.  The entire staff is a delight.  They were excellent in every way.  We loved the restaurant and bar food, too.  If you want a lovely stay, you must experience The Milestone Hotel.  Great location and two blocks from the tube."
April 2018,Felt like a Queen!,"What can't I say about the Milestone. The attention to detail and personalized service is top notch. I felt like I was the only guest in the hotel. From the doorman Patrico to the bartenders in the cozy stable bar to the concierge, wait staff and desk staff. Everything was just lovely and I cannot wait to return!"
May 2018,Above and beyond,The staff at milestone go above and beyond. The concierge Sonny and Connor were amazing! They met every one of our needs and more!! Travelling with 2 kids under 2 made easy thanks to these guys! Nothing we asked for was too much. I would highly recommend The Milestone Hotel ☆☆☆☆☆
April 2018,Ms. Kathy Mohr,"Absolutely the most excellent service. Beautiful accommodations, friendly and caring staff. They go the extra mile to take care of you and make you feel at home. My daughter and I will definitely return here and consider them home away from home."
May 2018,"Absolutely lovely, perfect ","Some things are hard to express that's also the stay at this hotel. Words are not enough for the experience one gets here.  The rooms are perfect, we stayed in the smallest queen room and whilst it being tight with the space it's so cosy! The bathroom is large though and turning on the roof shower is just magical. 5 stars are 5 stars here, from body products to robes, chocolates to hand written welcome messages it's all there.   I can absolutely recommend the taxi service the hotel offers too, whilst more expensive then normal the experience and quality is fantastic. Afternoon tea needs to be experienced and is a real treat, 2 hours quickly fly by.  One thing I want to mention, we are a couple enjoying a fancy trip for once and when the staff noticed the ease and openness we…"
April 2018,Superior in EVERY way,"This is my second review of The Milestone.  We first visited twice in 2017 and returned in March and April of 2018.  First, the staff is superior.  We did not expect to return to the U.K. after 2017  due to canine vaccination requirements.  I explained this to the staff when we left, that we could not return.  Considering this, I couldn’t believe that so many of them remembered my name and the name of my DOG almost one year later.  It is easy to assume that they read a client list or were provided with client cards but in all fairness, most of them were visibly surprised to see us arrive.  They remembered the small things such as my final farewell when we last parted, the make and model of my rental car from the previous year, and other various aspects specific to me and my…"
April 2018,A Special place!,We had four nights at this very superior hotel as part of our special overseas trip.  The hotel is visually spectacular in every way & in every nook & cranny. The decor & furnishings are truly  regal & plush. Our room was very beautiful with a small staircase up to the bedroom area from the doorway & bathroom. There was good storage space & a very comfortable king size bed. We were at first surprised there was no tea making facilities but that was quickly remedied. The bathroom was large with shower over the bath but not much storage space for makeup or toiletries as the only shelf was full of items from the hotel. Towel supply was abundant & thick & fluffy.  The only issue we had with the bathroom was the shower over the bath. I would normally specify a walk in shower but I had…
February 2018,Seamless Boutique Service... Perfection,I stayed at The Milestone for the first time with a friend last week for a mini break in London and to attend the Fashion Week Festival. The first thing that you cannot deny is the outstanding service that the staff provide. Immediately I was greeted by doorman Steve with a 'Welcome Home' smile and conversation flowed with the Concierge and Front of House team from there.  I was shown around the hotel to familiarise myself with the facilities and was greeted with kindness by the GM Mr Pike. I believe it was a young girl called Penny or Peggy(!?) who showed me around and she was so gracious and enthusiastic about the hotel - it was the brief history lesson of the building and charming stories of the past that made you feel like you were part of something special.   My room was…
February 2018,Sets the standard for excellence,"Stayed here last weekend and had a terrific time. Hotel staff are exceptionally good. Room was very welcoming and well appointed and attention to detail was evident in all aspects. Had dinner on the Friday night - the dining room is very small but the food and the service were both top notch. Try the dover sole if its on the menu, it was superb.  If you have a car then use the NCP across the road at the Royal Gardens Hotel. Looking forward to returning again for another stay."
February 2018,Outstanding Customer Service,Stayed here 2/9/2018 for five nights truly a step above any other hotel I've stayed at. Will always be were I stay when I go to London. The entire staff here needs two thumbs up. See you all sooner then later.
February 2018,Best hotel that I have ever stayed in! Customer service was incredible!,"The Milestone is literally my favorite hotel that I have ever stayed in.  It is impossible to put the quality of their customer service and the beauty of their grounds into words.  They truly treat their guests like royalty. I recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a perfect London experience.  It is certainly pricey, but I found the higher prices to be worth the many benefits that come with staying at the Milestone.  They also run pricing promotions throughout the year!  Pros:  -There were countless memorable aspects of our stay at the Milestone, but if I had to pick, I would say that the employees at the hotel were the most memorable part of our vacation.  They were so welcoming and personable.  They were also so happy to do anything to help make our vacation more…"
February 2018,Simply the best Hotel in London,"Though I have travelled the world and stayed in many great hotels, never before have I been compelled to write a review. The hotel itself and even more so the staff were truly astonishing. If you ever wish to be treated like a King, then this is simply the only hotel in London for you. The staff paid such attention to every little detail and in such a subtle manner. Though there were many other guests. they truly made me feel like I was the only one. Many thanks for such a fantastic stay and rest assured I intend to be back many times in the future. Jim Murphy"
February 2018,Wonderful!,"My my 4 night stay here last week was fantastic, and the service was fantastic. The room was amazing and the room service impeccable. One evening I dined in the hotel restaurant which was most enjoyable and immersive & can highly recommend the scallop starter and venison mains.   The staff went out of their way to ensure I had  pleasant stay - even when I mentioned that I had back trouble and had to stretch regularly, they even left a yoga DVD and player in the room. Before I left they ensured I had a hot beverage (it was about 2 degrees outside). Very thoughtful.   The staff were as tentative as anywhere I've been... ever! Location is top notch and right across from Kensington park. All in all it was a delightful stay and would highly recommend this hotel."
February 2018,Service will leave you speachless!,"This hotel is simply incredible.  Was my mothers first time out of the country, and she accompanied me while I did some business.  Wanted her to have a real British experience, but never anticipated the greatness that is the Milestone. I've stayed at many 5 star hotels, and yet this one creates a new 10th star in my book.  Not only was every detail covered, but details I would never think of were covered.  EVERY staff member is amazing, but my mom fell in love with her bartender friend Angelo. Every staff member knew our names by the end of just the first day.  The details in service blew me away on our last night yesterday.  We were running short on time and I asked Jose and Connor where I could get my little guy at home a Paddington Bear without taking a train ride to…"
February 2018,Cosy elegance with first class service,"We had a fabulous stay. My wife and daughter were in London to see a show and the hotel helped to make the trip so much more special. The staff were all, without exception, superb, helpful and genuinely friendly. The room had a view over the park with Kensington Palace dominating. So much so we were inspired to visit the Diana exhibition there that morning. Lyla loved to be in the room where Queen Victoria was born, and another where she was told she was Queen.  The room was spacious and yet cosy. All the small touches which separate a truly exceptional hotel from a great one. The notes, the robes and slippers laid out, the treats. The supplied bedtime reading was a new and very charming perk. The sofa bed for our daughter was soft and huge, she was out like a light. I would…"
November 2017,Special Place,"The service here is just amazing. The hotel has so much character. After 1 day all the people that worked there knew my name and when I went back on a second trip, they remembered me. The breakfast is one of the best meals I had while in London"
February 2018,Valentines day,After travelling such amount of places... you find super quality hotel from London... We practically live in hotels for the past 3 years... and This place just went straight to the Top 3 We ever visited!! Amazing room.. incredible service and staff!! Highly recommend to visit! We will return for sure
December 2017,A wonderful place to stay.,"If you're looking for somewhere with great service, beautiful rooms, a central London location with a spa - as well as a touch of old fashioned England - look no further! This hotel (a long time favourite) delivers on all fronts. And if you're interested in history, you'll have that too.  The Milestone combines beautifully decorated and sumptuously cosy, antique filled rooms with twentieth - century comfort. And then it does more: it thinks of every little thing you may need, or want, just to make your stay better. It's one of the reasons why I go back again and again."
February 2018,Truly Exceptional! Perfect Hospitality!,"We just returned from too brief a stay at The Miletsone. From the moment we stepped out of our taxi, we were greeted with great warmth, genuinely hospitable and warmly polite staff, toured through the gorgeous main floor lounges, pub, and elegant dining room.  We were ready for luxury after 2 weeks of skiing in Italy and touring Amsterdam. Our room was the perfect haven, neutral colors, upholstered walls, complimentary champagne delivered to us while we settled in, and fresh flower accents everywhere throughout the hotel.   The bath was quite clean, and fully outfitted with sparkling fixtures and an abundance of piping hot water and plenty of fluffy towels, and lovely amenities. Our arrival was later than expected, so we chose to dine in the glorious dining room - incredible…"
February 2018,Great hotel,"Stayed at this hotel due to work. Great hotel, great staff, room was clean and cozy. Next time i visit uk i Will guarantee I will stay here. Great service and service minded staff. I’ll come back soon again"
February 2018,The Spa Treatment at The Milestone,"I just had the most amazing facial, Fiona is a master masseuse. It’s been a long time since I left a facial treatment feeling completely rejuvenated. The creams, the oils, the face and neck massage was such an experience like no other. Fiona was just amazing. I walked out of the spa my face looking and feeling like velvet. Thank you Fiona!!"
February 2018,Afternoon tea birthday treat,"Well we had a wonderful afternoon, the staff simply couldn't do enough for you The hotel is just beautiful, and so very English The tea sandwiches , scones and cakes were exquisite and the customer service first class Thankyou for looking after us so well My sister and I had the perfect afternoon  "
February 2018,Superb!,"I have stayed in many luxury hotels, large and small, and I must say that The Milestone is at the top of my list. The hotel is lovely and we'll appointed. Room, dining room, lounge and bar are wonderful. But what sends The Milestone over the top is the above and beyond service!! Everyone knows your name and nothing is too much to ask. My friend the doorman, knowing that I ride my horse, walked me to a lovely equestrian store nearby. We come to London every February and this will be our go to home!"
February 2018,"Most attentive and friendly staff, great experience",Located a short walk from Kensington Palace and the Royal Albert Hall this amazing quality hotel has the best staff we have ever experienced - their attention to detail and service was second to none. Even to the point of putting a velcro strip around our Iphone charger cable!  Unexpected treats for my birthday to! Magnificent... We will be back! .
March 2017,Relatively unimpressed ,Booked this as a weekend away with friends quite a while ago but only just got round to reviewing it.  Upon arrival our rooms were not ready which was slightly inconvenient but they gave us a free drink.  The worst thing was when we went down for breakfast the next morning we were told there was no tables but we could eat breakfast In The coffee lounge The tables are so low and totally unsuitable- not impressed 
February 2017,Over priced to keep out the riff raff,Quiet but nevertheless enjoyable near to Hyde Park and Ken High Street for shops and etc. Expect a large bill for what ever services that you have here. Great interior and surprisingly cosy. Parking can be a real nightmare in central London so plan ahead and use public transportation   
December 2017,Very nice and cozy tea,"Went here with a lovely friend and her daughter joined us a bit later. The hotel is nice enough looking and the tea service was as good as tea at The Ritz but half the price and local to where my friend lived. Sandwiches very fresh and the usual salmon, egg salad, cucumber, ham and cheese - tasty cakes and patisseries - oven hot scones with all the delights that go with them. 9/10 and easy to park nearby in a side street!"
April 2018,Perfect Afternoon Tea with excellent service,"I do love a good afternoon tea and I'm slowly moving around the elegant hotels in London sampling afternoon tea, one hotel at a time!   I've been to several LHW including Ritz, Landmark, Cafe Royal & Browns so to tick The Milestone off the list was a welcomed treat.  It was a belated Mothers Day treat and on arrival we were greeted by Tim (concierge), a very warm welcome and he acknowledge to my mum that she hoped she was a having a lovely belated Mothers Day.  We sat in the lounge and had a lovely corner table by the window, just perfect. We went for the Royal Afternoon Tea, for an upgrade of £1 from the champagne afternoon tea you got strawberries and cream and 1/2 bottle of champagne.  Our waitress was Aysha, she recommend teas for my mum who for the first time was trying…"
March 2018,Perfect afternoon tea with a toddler!,"Our afternoon tea yesterday was absolutely fab. There are few places that cater so very well for a very small person (2.5 years old) so you can sometimes feel a little on edge taking them to certain places. However, absolutely no worries about that here, our son was treated like a prince - even being treated to his 'little prince' tea. Thank you for letting him decorate his own cupcake and for looking after him so it really felt like a family afternoon out rather than dragging him where we wanted to go! We will be back."
March 2018,The Milestone Hotel - a true gem!  My new #1 choice in London.,"To echo the well articulated reviews on The Milestone - this establishment is truly remarkable.  We just completed a 3 night stay over Easter weekend and the service quality and attention to detail was well beyond expectations.  From our welcome tour of the hotel with the butler, special touches from the turndown staff including a small army of chocolate Easter bunnies and other assortments each night, Afternoon Tea that was everything you would ever hoped it would be as a non Afternoon tea crowd, three separate fantastic breakfasts where the menu choices are broad and well executed, and one extraordinary dinner at Cheneston's, to the warm greetings at our every departure and return - the whole staff deserves special recognition for their level of execution.  Stayed at another…"
April 2018,Marvelous Milestone,"We spent 2  nights at this wonderful hotel. Staff were very attentive, friendly and always had a smile. Our stay was during the Easter Weekend. The Hotel had delicious displays of Chocolate Bunnies and eggs all over and we were treated to 2 Chocolate bunnies on our pillows at turn down. The attention to detail at the Red Carnation Hotels really makes guests feel special. Jose at the Concierge was most helpful and informative and so was Nik at Reception. Thank you for making our stay a memorable one. Looking forward to our next visit.   "
March 2018,Simply the best in London Kensington,"rooms and suites have charactor. good food and good service.   Breakfast is one of the best in london, very fresh yet healthy. The chicken sandwich of the afternoon tea is the most unique and tasty.   Location is superb, and perfect for business events."
March 2018,The Milestone Hotel -- outstanding experience from start to finish,"My first visit to the Milestone surpassed my wildest expectations.  Somehow the staff seem to know what you want before even you know it -- and they are a constant, happy presence on the property. I couldn't have been more pleased with the service I received, or the beautiful, spacious suite in which I stayed.  A few highlights for me:  Fiona Keane -- book a massage or spa treatment with her at your first opportunity. I had what she described as a 'relaxing massage,' (and what I described as 'the best massage I have ever had, hands down). She put me in an absolute trance, and I can only describe her work as miraculous! I will seek her out the next time I come to London.  The Milestone's restaurant, Cheneston's, was incredible. I sat at a cozy table next to a roaring fire (it was…"
March 2018,Near perfect!,"Exemplary service - from our initial welcome, being shown to our room, receiving our welcome drinks - the whole experience surpasses expectations and creates a fantastic experience.  This is my 3rd try if a Red Carnation hotel group chain - all have been brilliant   We had a lovely little room overlooking the park - perfect!  The bathroom was small, the shower was a small cubicle - but all presented beautifully.  We went out for the night and came back to lovely treats - again, all wonderful.  Then I tried to sleep.  I don't know if the walls are thin, or if it was next door being loud, but I ended up knocking on the wall at 1:30am because I could hear their tv perfectly and couldn't get to sleep.  They turned it down, went to sleep, then they and one or two rooms on our corner…"
March 2018,The Milestone Hotel... WOW!!!,"I am a person who is very much set in their ways and don’t welcome change.However, last Friday was my girlfriends Birthday and i decided to step away from our usual hotel of the Lanesborough or The Berkeley and I did some research online. This hotel came up as one of the top 10 most romantic Hotels in London.  Let me tell you it did not disappoint! from the moment we pulled up outside we were welcomed by a charming gentleman who made us feel instantly at home. Upon check in we were told that they had upgraded us to one of their most beautiful suites.. ( it was stunning and certainly one of the nicest rooms I have seen in London). We were then greeted by the hotels manager Leo who was enthusiastic and vert professional. They made the stay memorable from a beautiful strawberry…"
March 2018,Exceptional Massage Therapist at The Milestone,"I arrived at The Milestone Hotel on a flying visit from Australia, bent and immobile with lower back pain. The hotel is lovely, with possibly the warmest and most welcoming staff of any hotel I have stayed in (Nuala was exceptional). However, this review is about Fiona Keane, the massage therapist who treated me at the hotel. Fiona treated me twice during my brief visit, with extraordinary results. Her assessment of my problem was spot on, and her treatment thorough, extremely effective and even enjoyable (which isn't always a given!). She advised me as to what I needed to do to address my problem in the immediate and longer term, and since my return to Australia has been in contact to check how I am doing. In my experience, this level of treatment is exceptional, and I cannot…"
March 2018,Absolutely Fabulous,"The hotel was charming, very clean and had a good vibe.  The staff was overwhelming wonderful on every level without being intrusive. The bed and linens were extraordinaire.  We highly recommend The Milestone London to London travelers and locals for The Stable Bar.  "
November 2017,"Exclusive London hotel, a place you must try when staying in London","I have to say from the moment we entered the hotel to the last final farwell we found this hotel very welcoming, professional, amazing luxury hotel in a great location in London, with some proper old English interior. Do not expect a large modern hotel, expect a small luxury paradise instead, sometime quirky but very interesting. Our room was a great room with so many nice little gifts to welcome us, which is normal in this modern times. This place takes you back to how a hotel should be, as you will be looked after while you stay. We stayed in 204 which was a really nice quiet internal room towards the central lightwell, so nice and quiet. Highly recommended hotel. Oh, I recommend the smokey whisky, which is served in a very elegant way. Cheers!"
November 2017,Wonerful Csutomer Service,Stayed for one evening as I had a meeting nearby. Apart from the beautiful building and characterful rooms what struck me the most was the excellent service throughout the hotel. Everyone I encountered was pleasant and helpful and they seem to have really genuine staff. Great location also and highly recommended.
November 2017,Best Hotel ever ,I have been into many hotels none of them get closer to the experience I got from this hotel. Check in  Check out  breakfast  Room  Bed  Bathroom  Staff  Everythings was wright  and in it's place  I loved all the staff all of them were very polite and Willing to help me to make my visit to London the best ...  Thank u very much for all staff   U deserve to be #1 hotel in london 
November 2017,One of the best,"We arrived at the Milestone tired and weary, we left refreshed and happy. What made the difference? The staff; they make you feel at home, take a genuine interest in your welfare, go above and go beyond the expected to meet your needs. For example, we asked the concierge for the location of a good Italian restaurant. He recommended one nearby, called to make sure we could get in and had one of his assistants walk us over.  One afternoon the hotel manager greeted us by name as we waked in, asked if we were being well taken care of and we were. From the barman to the doorman, concierge and reception staff, they all go out of their way to remember who you are and make your stay an enjoyable experience.  As for the hotel’s facilities, the public areas are comfortable and plush, the…"
November 2017,Beautiful home away from home,"We returned to The Milestone again & are enjoying 6 lovely nights here. The hotel is just as good as last year, with warm & attentive service, lovely food in Cheneston's restaurant & immaculate housekeeping. We have a few more days here but want to give special thanks to Andrea, Jose & Conor, the Concierges, Teddy who greets everyone at the door with warmth & humour & Sandra in the restaurant. We'd never stay anywhere else."
November 2017,Delightful London Surprise,"First time stay at The Milestone so we did not know what to expect. Location is excellent (near Kensington Palace. Hotel is beautiful in the classic sense of Old London - heavy woodwork, leaded glass windows and fine details. The delightful surprise was the staff. WOW!!! These people are fantastic. No detail too small. No request unwelcome. We were greeted at the curb by Steve, in top hat, tails and regalia. Rain or shine, he was out front to take care of our needs. Leo at the front desk was the fixer. He jumped on any issue no matter how minuscule. Andrea the Concierge, knows everything about London. His recommendations were excellent.  David selected our wines and he knows his trade. Edgar took care of us in the dining room where the food was superb and the service impeccable.…"
October 2017,Milestone Hotel,"A wonderful experience. Fantastic room and amazing service. Great facilities. Live entertainment in the evenings.Close to Hyde Park, shopping , buses and metro. Thoroughly recommend. Best boutique hotel ever."
November 2017,This is one of the best boutique luxury hotels in the world,"I have been visiting the Milestone Hotel for more than ten years now, but it had been a couple of years since my last visit for a variety of reasons. Upon my return, I was reminded that this is one of the best luxury boutique hotels in the world. It is just fabulous in every way. Every member of the staff goes above and beyond: Doorman, front desk, waiters in the bar, room service and housekeeping (I had the loveliest conversation with one of the maids when I asked where she was from.) In the bar when I was really tired and was going to have a glass of wine before going to bed, they brought me special snacks. The doorman offered me an umbrella when it was lightly raining. The front desk was charming and welcoming. The rooms are lovely, the spaces are warm and wonderfully…"
July 2017,Fabulous hiotel,Great food and service- lovely bar and breakfast room Location is one of the best in London- walking by distance to Kensington Palace and Harrod's! Great restaurants in the neighborhood and wonderful sights.
November 2017,Excellent afternoon tea ,"My wife and I had a wonderful afternoon tea today at the Milestone. It was a surprise for my wife's birthday tomorrow and the staff made her feel very special, even bringing a cake and candle with happy birthday! The service was very personal and the food excellent, the surroundings and decor were intimate. We would thoroughly recommend the Milestone and hope to be back soon! Thank you."
October 2017,Well situated across from Kensington Palace. Great Service,"This was a lovely boutique hotel directly across from Kensington Palace. The staff was fabulous-almost too solicitous. My room was very, very nice with great amenities. Breakfast was terrific. The concierge was one of the best as he was knowledgeable as well as friendly. I would compare this hotel to some of the finest in London and rate it quite highly. My only ""beef"" was that my room was not ready for the early check- in that overseas guests need.  However, for a 100 pound upgrade there would be a room ready. I decided  to wait which was only for 30 minutes during which time they nicely gave me some coffee. I would recommend this hotel and I would certainly return. Very expensive."
November 2017,Afternoon Tea,"My family and I spent a couple of hours at this marvellous hotel. We arrived a little bit earlier by taxi, and was greeted by their doorman. Since we arrived ca 40 min earlier I asked him where the nearest pub was located. He told us not to bother with that one, but if we could make the effort of walking a couple of minutes he could recommend one. Then he said “as a matter of fact I show you the way” Three minutes later we arrived at the pub, while showing us the way he told us a few interesting things about the neighbourhood. FIRST CLASS SERVICE! Btw the Afternoon Tea was excellent and the staff was top notch. Highly recommended. "
November 2017,beautiful boutique hotel,"We stayed here as an experience gift from my sister so we had a package with dinner and breakfast as well as a beautiful room for the evening.  The Milestone is a classic classy hotel. The room had one of the biggest tv's I've seen in a hotel for a long time, a comfy bed, nice bathroom with lovely toiletries and nice big towel."
October 2017,Heaven missed,"I don't visit London often...... big mistake...... I didn't revisit my favourite and stay at the Milestone Please don't make make the same mistake. There is only one hotel that offers beautiful individually appointed bedrooms, restaurants, relaxed areas, cloakrooms and even corridors!!! Staff who are chosen for their professionalism. One is made to feel soooo very welcome. Peggy, Connor and Tim on the welcome desk reminded me I had made such a HUGE mistake not staying with them.  My other favourite being d'Angleterre in Geneva. The Red Carnation Group have Service tapped Location, location.... easy for most things needed See you soon dearest Milestone"
October 2017,Warm ambiance and attentive staff to the smallest detail.,"The room is  an amazing Master Suite with lovely windows overlooking Kensington Park. The furniture is very warm and the amenities are perfect. The friendly, high standard of the staff and their attention to our needs is gratifying; making the Milestone our home for one week away from home."
October 2017,5 star hotel with a down to earth attitude ,"We stayed at the Milestone to go to the Royal Albert Hall. It was a five minute walk so very handy. The hotel itself was delightful. They had thought of every little detail, try the aromatherapy pillows they smell lovely. The staff were very friendly and helpful. It was a great hotel for a birthday surprise. Don't forget to ask for the tea tray! "
October 2017,Lovely!,"I stayed here when I spent four days in London. The hotel is beautiful and the staff is really nice and attentive. The room service and afternoon tea are great. The hotel is right near Kensington Palace and the Victoria and Albert Museum. The best part about the hotel is the food, especially the Belgian waffles and honey comb icecream. Stay here!"
August 2017,Amazing place and people,"What a wonderful hotel We had looked at other high end hotels in the area and chose the Milestone. Our room was wonderful and so cozy. Each room is unique and ours was a bi-level with great shower, tub and heated towel rack. The bed was super comfortable and they even set up a small bed for our 9 year old daughter. We all had beautiful robes waiting and they even had one for our daughter. Each day there was a nice treat on her bed for her. Great location. Another highlight was the staff. They knew who we were and they set up a special tea and dinner for our children. The bar staff were great and looked after us and got the ""cosmos"" perfected. I wish I could remember their names (two from Italy and one from Germany) We also loved the choice of beer. The one from Namibia was great…"
October 2017,Truly one of the best hotels in the world,"From the minute you arrive at The Milestone Hotel, you feel completely welcomed and happy.  The staff goes above and beyond to make you feel comfortable and well cared for.  This is a professionally run, deluxe hotel that will give you a 5 star experience.  Our room, the services, the staff, and the breakfast - everything was perfectly done.  Every time we entered our beautiful room, we felt like we were in an English country manor house and had been given the best room!  I would also like to add that the hotel had been particularly accommodating to us.  We did not originally book at The Milestone, but at a nearby hotel at which we had a very unpleasant experience.  Not only did The Milestone find us a room immediately but their welcoming atmosphere made us feel completely…"
October 2017,The Ultimate English experience,"When you go to England you want to have an English experience, right? Well, look no farther; this is it. Within minutes of checking in, every staff member knows your name. the room is large and yet cozy. The bar is charming and well stocked. Afternoon tea is classic and wonderful. Smashing!"
August 2017,Perfect!,From the moment you walk in you are made to feel like one of the family.The reception  and all their staff are so very friendly and relaxed. They give you all the help you need and it is obvious that this is something they enjoy doing.  The Milestone is well situated in the central area of London within an easy walk of all the main sites and attractions.
December 2017,Best service ever!,"I arrived way earlier than expected on a cold December weekday just as the first snow flakes started to fall. I had booked the hotel after I could not get into Hotel 41 which was full. I was not disappointed. The service levels from the time I arrived till I left are by far the best I had ever seen or experienced, in fact its better than the 41, which is a benchmark when it comes to service. Its the personal touch like a cup of coffee while you wait for the room in an amazing lounge thats feels like a upmarket house. Speedy assistance to get a suit pressed for the my evening function. Room well thought out with all the extras and very homely, brilliant bathroom and all very clean. There is a lot of little things for free that make the experience even better. Breakfast has a…"
October 2017,Beautiful,Lovely hotel couldn’t fault it at all. Had a lovely weekend. Will be recommending to friends and family!  Will be visiting again very soon.  Gorgeous location and not too noisy! Room was just what we had pictured and net our expectations
November 2017,Love this Home from Home!,"Entertained clients in the Oratory - a small private room which doubles up as either private dining or suitable for intimate weddings or civil ceremonies.  Amazing service and food - what more can you expect from a 5* hotel winning so many accolades!  it is expensive, but you get what you pay for, and if  you want to impress, this is one of the best places to do so in Kensington."
December 2017,Excellent ,"I’ve stayed in some amazing hotels around the world, but none that has the staff and level of service that this hotel has...everyone went above and beyond to make this a comfortable and welcoming experience for my husband and I, who were travelling with our 3year old..excellent "
December 2017,TRULY WONDERFUL,"Excellent in every sense with the most professional service from staff who were a joy to meet.World class from check-in to check-out.  The Milestone offers the welcome, comfort and style of a lovely country house with it's fabulous interior and a situation overlooking Kensington Gardens. An oasis of luxuriant cosy peace in the heart of London.  Our bedroom and bathroom were perfect with no detail overlooked. Dining options range from a fantastic formal menu to light snacks and even a midnight feast.  The staff make this hotel what it is and were unobtrusively on hand to assist in every way . They even mentioned a stay that my late mother had there several years ago - which was very touching."
November 2017,Excellent,"Very friendly hotel. Nice building. Beautiful architecture. Good location, close to public transport. Great menu with excellent food, especially dessert. Very good service and great staff. Clean nice comfortable room."
December 2017,Amazing staff,"As this was my first trip to London I found the Milestone staff incredibly helpful and friendly.  Having few plans for my three day visit they did everything from efficiently planning my days and providing tips on where and when to be for the best experiences, to directing me to the most delicious fish and chips in London.   The hotel itself is small and luxurious with cozy nooks throughout.  I hope to return soon."
September 2017,Lovely stat,Visited first time to London... The check-in process was so quick and they escort us to the rooms. After some rest we choose to roam the hotel the artiticture is mesmerising..we like the furniture and things that they got its is world class the hotel serve us like we did not our family. Great staff and services...food was great and even rooms was breath taking We definitely we come back
November 2017,Perfection,"This was our third stay at the Milestone and, as usual, it exceeded our expectations.  The staff are extraordinary.  They go the extra mile in all they do.  The entire hotel is immaculately kept, the food at the hotel's restaurant is excellent, and the afternoon tea is quite spectacular.  For us, there is no where else in London that we would consider staying."
September 2017,"The service from the staff was exceptional, always felt safe, comfortable and welcome.","The attention to detail by the staff, the furnishings, concierge, waiters, front desk staff, doormen, room service, suite attendants was equally exceptional. Staff got to know us and engaged with us each time we crossed paths. The location of the hotel in the Kensington area was perfect for our visit to London"
September 2017,My Dream and My Home,"Your hotel, your staff, your service, your room (especially apt #1) was amazing. I asked, Is this real?:) You make me feel so special, so happy. this hotel will be my home in London:) If you really want to feel this feeling, pls stay there. Before I checked out, I scored and gave 10, after that the general manager sent me an email to thank you. This also shows the difference. After I checked out, you still make me special,my opinions are important for you. I am really so grateful and thank you very much for all your interest. I hope I ll come again..."
September 2017,Best hotel in London,"This is a return visit for us.  Positioned conveniently opposite Kensington Palace with its beautiful park and gardens, this is a luxurious hotel.  From the moment you approach the doors, to the beautifully appointed bedrooms, this is an exquisite experience.  The staff are superb, welcoming without this patronising attitude that a lot of high class hotels seem to air.  The public area are superb, relaxing and so comfortable.  The breakfast here is fantastic, beautifully presented, with every choice you could imagine.  I really don’t want to shout too loud about this gorgeous hotel as I may find I cannot book in future!!  I can’t wait to return. Thank you to all at The Milestone "
October 2017,The Royal Treatment,"This place is the most service-oriented hotel I've ever stayed in. We just wrapped up a 5 day stay here and feel a little like we are leaving home. The food in the restaurant is excellent, as is the service (thanks, Jack). All of the staff are friendly and helpful. The bar is great, too. A wonderful change of pace from a chain hotel. Will definitely recommend to friends."
September 2017,Superior Hotel,"We had the pleasure of staying at the Milestone Hotel in Kensington for four nights in September 2017. This is  an exceptionally well situated boutique hotel across from Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. Our bedroom was well furnished and meticulously cared for.  All the staff took great care to remember our names and furnish us with anything we might need to make our stay memorable.  There is a cozy bar, lovely atrium room ideal for afternoon tea, a well appointed dining room for breakfast/dinner. And obviously a very good chef running the kitchen. Highly recommended."
September 2017,Magnificent!,"The Milestone sets the standard for five star elegance and over-the-top hospitality.  Every need is anticipated by the staff.  The bar and restaurant are outstanding and the service is superb.  For the business traveler, the hotel offers peaceful rest in a comfortable setting.  For the vacationer, an elegant, romantic setting.  This is my new destination in London for both!"
September 2017,"Outstanding accommodations, staff and service","When our AX travel agent recommended this hotel, I pushed back because I had never heard of the hotel. I am really happy that we stayed with her recommendation for our first two nights in London. We were booked in the Viscount Suite with a view of Kensington Palace and Garden.  Every member of the staff goes out of their way to make one's stay as nice as is humanly possible. The full English breakfast is exceptional and it includes a full buffet of a continental breakfast before the hot breakfast. You can step across the street to visit Kensington Palace and grounds.  We highly recommend The Milestone Hotel and will return here for a longer stay next year. "
September 2017,Absolutely amazing,"I have stayed at some of the finest hotels in the world....Said with humility but honesty.  The service at the Milestone is the best I have ever encountered.  Had a beautiful suite.  The restaurant is terrific.   But the service....I truly do not have the words to describe it.  The Milestone makes the Savoy look like a Holiday Inn at best!   Truly my favorite hotel---better than Taj, Aman, Penisula...you name it....Thank you Milestone!"
September 2017,Absolute Perfection,"I don't think we have ever stayed at a nicer hotel and certainly not one with the incredible staff we encountered.  From the doorman who chased the cab around the corner to carry our luggage inside to the bartender who set up an impromptu gin tasting for my wife, every person went out of his or her way to make us welcome and comfortable.  Once the staff discovered it was our anniversary, the bar was raised even higher.  Champagne, chocolates, a private dinner in the small dining room -- all with a smile.  I would not begin to single out any one person as all deserve equal accolades.  We had dinner twice.  Both meals were delicious, accompanied by expert, attentive service.   The room (309 I think) was perfect; cozy and spotless.  Kudos to the entire team.  A terrific experience…"
September 2017,Birthday & Gig Stay,"Just returned from a night away from the kids which makes most hotels feel great, but the Milestone went the extra mile with brilliantly warm and friendly staff.  From the moment we were greeted by the doorman, to the reception team through to everyone we made contact with in the hotel, a smile and greeting has never far away.  Our room (302) was lovely with nice details and extremely comfortable decoration and furnishings.  I had organised a bottle of champagne and other little bits for my wife's birthday, which without any prompting arrived subtly and promptly.  They even asked as reception if we were away for a special occasion, which resulted in yet another little surprise of tiny pastries/cakes and a card in our room.  Another nice touch.  We had dinner very early (1730)…"
August 2017,Lovely spa day,"Came here for a massage and to use facilities for a few hours. Whilst the spa is very small (small swimming pool, sauna, small relaxing area enough for two ppl then gym, changing rooms and massage room) it was perfect for what we wanted and we were the only ones there. The pool had a jet so that you can swim in one place against the current.  Massage was really lovely and the therapist, Moy (sp?) was so welcoming - we both felt so relaxed after. Would definitely go again if in the area "
July 2017,Wonderful stay,It was our first time in London I am very happy to stay in hotel milestone hospitality is too good laundry service is available in the hotel free WiFi Internet access spa is available in the hotel swimming pool is also ervry thing was great fantabulus thank you for feel me like homely 
July 2017,Stellar Experience ,"My husband and I celebrated my 30th birthday and our 8 year wedding anniversary. We went to London, Paris and Rome. We can truly share with you all that no one made us feel more at home than the wonderful team at The Milestone Hotel!! Our experience was stellar, the staff members truly go beyond the call of duty to make you feel at home. From the minute our driver pulled up to the hotel we were given the royal treatment! We truly can't wait to go back and stay again at The Milestone Hotel! We will see you soon Patricio, Ronald, Fran!! To name a few ❤️"
August 2017,Amazing,"Wow, what a phenomenal place.  A really great property with spectacular staff.  I was made to feel extremely special at every single moment.  Kind of awe inspiring how detailed and genuine their interest was in being invested in me as there guest.  Location is excellent.  Common spaces comfortable, cozy and upscale.  I want to give a special mention to Clea who kept me engaged in conversation while awaiting my cab ride to the airport.  Frank and Jose at concierge for especially arranging everything regarding my tickets to a soccer/football game.  Pranav for a fantastic check-in.  Angelo in the lounge was amazingly friendly.  All these amazingly polished staff were spot on with each guest, not just me.  Room was spotless.  Fruits on special treats at check in and throughout my…"
October 2016,The Best,"stayed in Mistinguett suite Wife organised as a surprise for my birthday. The room was fantastic  Champagne was in room as well as cake.We had drinks in race theme bar,great place for drinks.Went to China town for meal and back to Milestone. The staff were fantastic  through  out stay.Next day had cream tea in the most fantastic room .When you step outside the Milestone it make you feel like a million dollars to know you have stayed in one of the world's best hotels.Exspenive but I am sure my wife would say worth every penny. Thanks to ALL the staff."
June 2017,Top Notch Historic Hotel in London!,"Fabulous stay with FABULOUS service. Ask for the wakeup service.  They come knock on your door with a wonderful tray of fresh coffee to help wake you up.  Incredible staff.  We had afternoon tea which was also a wonderful London experience.  The bar area on the patio is a must see. Also, the cocktail under smoked glass is a must order."
April 2017,City break,"Clean and comfortable rooms a bit dated but did the job. Fair  walk from shops specially when the weather isn't that great and you have a pram to push all the way. Staff have been great, very polite and helpful. Couldn't comment about the food as we didmt use that facility, although other friends that were staying here with us did and said it was good quality and tasty. Would recommend"
June 2017,The Place to Stay in London,"I should start by telling you that this is my husband's favorite hotel ever. And for me, it ranks right there with Le Sireneuse (pre-husband).   The hotel sits right on the edge of Hyde Park, in front of Kensington Gardens (which are in front of Kensignton Palace, a five minute walk from the hotel). It is in the grandest neighborhood in London. In fact, London't most posh residential street is mere blocks away. But that's less important for a tourist. The important things for us were the fact that we could walk to the fabulous museum district, there was a nearby metro stop, and there are lots of restaurants nearby. London is a huge city--it felt to us, probably because we were not familiar with it--bigger than New York, so having a convenient hotel in the heart of this lovely…"
July 2017,The Magnificent Milestone!,"The signature trait of The Milestone is exemplary service and a gracious staff.  The amenities can be found at other hotels, but you cannot find the qualified wonderful staff that embodies The Milestone. The hotel is located across from Hyde Park and Kensington Palace. It is a short walk to the Royal Albert Hall.  Andrei, one of the concierge staff, through his connections was able to get us great seats to the first night of PROMS on the day of the performance.   You may get beautiful accommodations elsewhere, but the service is matched by none."
July 2017,Highlight of trip was our stay at Milestone,"Did not think it could get better than previous visit last fall but it did! Spent a week and entire staff was like family - world class starting with Jose and his concierge team to creative bar staff to front desk to doorman Steven.  Wonderful servers in restaurant be it for breakfast, high tea or dinner.  Have stayed in big and small hotels around the world from NY to Paris to Bangkok. This is as good as it gets. "
June 2017,AN EXCELLENT HOTEL TO STAY FOR VACATION OR ANNIVERSARY,"Our family's stay in The Milestone Hotel in London went beyond our dreams. This was an extraordinary experience for our 40th anniversary! The staff were delightful and catered to all our needs and comfort. The location was in walking distance of our family members and some of them joined us for breakfast. The food, amenities and valet parking was excellent. We will be telling our travel agent of AAA Utah to Highly recommend this unique hotel. We have already informed all our family and friends. Can't wait to visit London and stay there again in the near future."
July 2017,Fabulous afternoon tea,"Myself and two friends visited The Milestone on Saturday 1st July for afternoon tea. We were greeted with such a warm welcome - nothing was too much trouble, the service was faultless and the hotel was beautiful.  There is an endless tea menu and the varying platters of sandwiches, cakes and scones were absolutely delicious! We even had to take some home with us in a box as we weren't quite able to finish it all!  The staff can't do enough for you and there was no feeling of being rushed even though the hotel was busy.  A really lovely afternoon, thank you.  "
July 2017,Miles above the rest!,"My wife and I had to come up with plans for a different kind of London trip as the Adele concert we wanted to attend was suddenly canceled and we had booked our flights way in advance with no cancellation option. Staying at the Wembley Hilton across the venue didn’t make sense anymore so we had to pick a new hotel in central London. Great reviews led us to The Milestone Hotel. A beautiful building in a great location right next to Kensington Gardens. When we arrived a bit before checkin time and the room wasn’t ready we got complementary glasses of champagne and chatted with the especially friendly and attentive staff for a while, then were treated to a short tour highlighting the great history of this place. We had booked a deluxe studio room that - like the rest of the…"
May 2017,"Great staff, ok room, poor location","The staff was wonderful. The bartenders, concierge, front office, and servers were all great.  Above all were the bellmen who spent many minutes flagging down cabs, a problem caused by horrible traffic.   Dinner was excellent.  The breakfast was pretty good, although buffet could have been better.  The room was nice, we looked out on the park.  A serious problem was a steep step to the bathroom.  I have bad legs and it was a problem  Location was bad. On the SW corner of Kensington Park there is nothing near by, except K Palace itself. The tube is 0.4 miles away, so a cab is needed. The traffic is very bad, and the bellmen spent many minutes flagging one down  We would happily return if we got a better room and somehow traffic was better"
June 2017,Most Extraordinary Staff we have EVER EXPERIENCED,"The Milestone is a truly charming, lovely, boutique hotel situated directly across from Kensington Palace. The physical charms of the place could be enough, but the staff and the extra touches are beyond amazing. We were there for only 4 days/nights but felt like we belonged, with everyone greeting us by name, serving us beyond what was expected, and bringing surprises every night including a strawberry birthday cake. The turndown services and high tea, the in room accoutrements, everything was perfect. Plus the dover sole in the restaurant was some of the best I have ever eaten.  Kudos to everyone at the Milestone for contributing to such a wonderful London visit."
July 2017,Don't stay anywhere else,Incredible hotel. True 5 star service. The hotel is in a beautiful area just across from Kensington palace. The food is excellent. We were still on USA time and loved that we were able to have food served in the lounge at midnight. Also have the best mixed drinks in london.Can't say enough about this place. Definitely will be back.
May 2017,Amazing Experience,"Wow wow wow. What can I even say about the Milestone Hotel. This was by far the best hotel experience we have ever had. Upon check-in, they gave us a tour of the hotel for about 20 mins, telling us about all of the history which was very cool in itself. Our room was smaller but very nice and it has premium everything. The elevators, stairs, every common area, super nice. They also give all guest any free drink upon check-in which is also cool. This hotel is also right off of the Underground which is easy too.  The dedicated 24 hour concierge here is amazing too, there are a few staff that do this job and all are excellent at recommending things. They can also book things for you at a discount and avoid the lines which is also amazing. They booked us tickets to a show and tickets…"
June 2017,Amazing Small Hotel in London,"The Milestone is probably one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in and we have stayed in a lot of great hotels.  This is a beautifully restored old hotel overlooking Hyde Park with exquisite details in room decor, linens, toiletries and other amenities.  Food is top notch and the bar is classic London pub with a great bartender.  To match the great facility is the amazing staff and incredible customer service.  We arrived by taxi from our flight from Nice France and the doorman greeted us by name, whisked us into the hotel and said I am so sorry but there is someone checking in at the moment so let's go to the bar and I will buy you a drink.  He told the bartender to get us anything we wanted while we waited.  We were served by a great bartender and three times while we…"
May 2017,Perfection,"Just a few days ago, my mother and I returned to the US after a wonderful 3-week trip in Europe.  The Milestone Hotel was a definite highlight of our entire trip.  The property is simply beautiful.  It provided us with the ""old world"" decor and experience we'd hoped for.  During our five-night stay, we had the opportunity to stay in two lovely rooms, each with unique and sumptuous decor.  We felt so pampered by the little touches, including the welcome drink, luxurious soaps, complimentary water, cute slippers, surprise champagne, candles in the bath tub, treats on our pillows, special gifts brought to our room, etc, etc.  The rooms were spotless (the remote control was even sanitized!), the beds very comfortable, and the décor was gorgeous and inviting.  The antique…"
May 2017,Great hotel with incredible service,"The Hotel itself is decorated impeccably for the location and the time period of the hotel. The fresh flowers that are placed in your room daily to the slippers being set up at the side of your bed at turndown service make the quality of the housekeeping above par. They not only turned down the bed and set out the slippers, they left candies as well as turned on the television to a romantic music channel and had candles lit throughout the room. When you wake up you can go down to the restaurant and have a full English breakfast that was probably the best meal we had while we were in London. I know that is not saying much since London is not known for their cuisine, but everything we had was excellent. Fresh orange, grapefruit or pineapple juice accompanied the perfectly cooked…"
June 2017,Paradise found,"The traffic from the airport was horrible and the day was very warm and humid.  London cabs are not air conditioned, so by the time we pulled up in front of the hotel, we were not in the best of moods, however the moment we stepped out of the cab, were greeted by an immaculately dressed doorman escorted up the stairs and into the lobby our moods were changed from flat to almost giddy.  We felt transported into the ideal England, cool and crisp with every visual clue saying that everything was going to be just fine.  The staff was friendly without too much sugar added.  We were given a short tour of the ground floor; sitting room, dining spaces and hallways filled with non-pretentious art and then shown up to our room (303), a very pretty two level affair with the bathroom tucked…"
June 2017,The Milestone London,"This hotel was perfect for our vacation.  Great location, wonderful rooms, and best of all the staff.  From check in to departure the staff handled our every need.  I will stay there again the next time I am in London."
May 2017,The Stables Bar,"Recommended by a friend as a great place for really good cocktails, we were not at all disappointed! A quiet bar tucked back into a gorgeous hotel with a fun ambience and amazing service and bites. The Old Fashioned came out in a clear dome with smoke giving the cocktail a very unique twist on a old classic. The champagne cocktails were fantastic. Looking forward to coming back again someday soon!"
June 2017,Treated like royalty ,"I brought my 13 yr old daughter to London for the first time. We spent 8 luxurious days at the Milestone. It is a beautiful hotel in lovely Kensington. The staff is what makes this place so special. They are knowledgeable, helpful and thought of our every need and surprised us with many treats before we could request them. We cannot say enough about this crew. Tim and Andreas (concierge team) took such great care of us, as well as the bar team, wait staff, doormen and housekeeping. It is obvious that they all love their work and their clients. Thank you for an amazing home away from home! xo Sandy and Grace"
May 2017,Best Hotel I've ever stayed at.  ,"Had an amazing stay here in May. The staff were top notch in their dedication to service.  The bar was small but very comfortable.  Order an old fashioned, it's bare far the best presentation I've ever seen.  "
May 2017,Five Star Perfection!,"One cannot do better than to spend your stay in London at The Milestone Hotel.  The Milestone is a true five star hotel with a staff who are willing to always go above and beyond any expectation to make you feel like a treasured house guest. The Milestone's philosophy is simple and effective - they are the best because they absolutely put the customer first!.  During this trip, we we negatively impacted by the British Airways global IT outage.  The staff at the Milestone did everything in their power to ensure that we were able to rearrange our schedule so that we would not miss any of our planned activities despite losing some vacation time due to the BA debacle.  We would not think of staying anywhere else in London because the Milestone has continuously earned our loyalty and…"
June 2017,Why would you stay anywhere else?,"The Milestone Hotel is my go to place in London.  It's an easy drive to and from Heathrow.  But, the hotel after 6-7 stays the last 3 years has never disappointed and always delighted.  The staff is excellent.  They make you feel so at home.  They are top notch and always want to serve.  It's my experience that at 5-star hotels that I often feel as if a hand is out all the time for a tip -- and here when you tip I felt so appreciated and never expected.  The rooms are excellent old english style with amazing amenities.  The food is just outstanding.  Simple.  Clean. Fresh.  Amazing.  The bar area is wonderful with the black and white garden room.  I stayed for the first time on a vacation with my family and the hotel did everything possible to make it an absolute delight.  From…"
June 2017,Amazing ,Booked The Milestone as a birthday treat and was not disappointed! The room was beautiful and the way we were treated was fantastic. Special mention to Peggy who was really lovely...we will definitely be back!
June 2017,British Excellence,"One of the most gorgeous and unique boutique hotels in the world. Each of the rooms are different and very unique. The bar is wonderful. Tea service is lovely (they even have a special tea for younger guests). You don't have to be staying at the hotel to come for tea or stop in for drinks, so I'd recommend stopping by even if you don't stay here. "
May 2017,Impeccable Service,"This very British establishment features first rate hospitality and  a lovely ambience. The lobby and rooms are a bit small and the restaurant overpriced, but the staff, decor and location are superb and we would not hesitate to recommend this hotel."
April 2017,Love This Place!,"A fantastic hotel with superior service, full of luxury and comfort. Elegant conservatory is the perfect Afternoon Tea destination. I cannot wait to return as it is one of the best hotels that I have ever had tea and drinks in."
May 2016,Beautiful and Clean..,Highly recommend..  The staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was very nice and clean..  Very historic.. Our room had a lovely view...  And places around to walk to.. In a safe area and some Pub's and food..
April 2017,Nice hotel,This hotel has the best rooms. Nicely decorated place. This is one of niceist hotels we visited. Service nixe and polite. Prices are moderate and we will recommande this place. I was  so happy and l 'll come back again.
April 2017,Amazing April Vacation,"We had an amazing stay at the Milestone last week.  We stayed in the Kensington Garden Suite, a lovely split level room.  Our daughters, ages 7 and 10 loved the room.  The service is incredible.  Jose, head concierge, was an incredible resource for the trip planning before we arrived, and of course during the stay (it is impressive when they anticipate what you need before you ask).  From the moment the driver picked us up at the airport we were made to feel special.  Everyone knows your name (yes being from Boston that may sound cliche but it was nice).  We stayed six nights which included Easter.  The Hotel arranged an easter egg hunt for all the kids staying there.  A nice touch.   We thoroughly enjoyed an afternoon tea on Easter.  Breakfast was excellent every morning with…"
March 2017,Red Carnation Collection experience Part 2,"Continuing my Red Carnation Collection Hotel tour: after checking out of the Egerton Hotel I arrived directly at The Milestone, the No2 ranking Hotel of TripAdvisor. It is a much bigger hotel comparing to their sister hotel but the service is just as good, if not better. Directly next to the Hyde Park and Royal Albert Hall, the location is unbeatable. My room was spacious, the bed was confortable and the washroom was very clean. Again like the Egerton Hotel, I had the wonderful surprise romantic turndown in the evening and of course the chocolate covered strawberries! I love their cosy Stables bar and the very stylish black and white Conservatory: Milestone Old Fashioned (cocktail) is a must try. Again the breakfast is cooked as it should, very correct. You can even choose a…"
April 2017,wonderful hotel all around!!,"Fantastic service, good location, amazing breakfast, great specials!  Very comfortable and responsive, enjoyed a late night meal in the cozy bar with Leon, the attentive bartender:), they all go out of their way to be helpful...manager was very amenable...comfortable and worth five stars!"
April 2017,Great place,"This hotel is one of the Great places I've ever stayed in ! The rooms are luxurious and comfortable. The staff goes out of its way to help. The location is perfect. There are not enough adjectives to adequately describe my experience, Can't wait to go back!"
April 2017,Visiting with 6 and 7 year olds over Easter,"WOW! From start to finish! We had heard that the accommodations were top-notch, and that was true. I did not take pictures of our suite as the photos on the site and on Trip Advisor did the room justice.  What pleased me most was the attention and respect that was shown to our kids. From the moment we walked in, they were greeted the same way we were. They were given cute cars to play with as well as some chocolate laid out for the Easter holiday.  We were visiting in order to see ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"" (which was AMAZING!) and the boys dressed up in Hogwarts robes, wands, and house accessories. When we entered the lobby, the staff fawned all over them! They even took pictures. When we returned to our room, the pictures had been printed, FRAMED, and left for us to…"
April 2017,Trip of a lifetime!,"We stayed at The Milestone Hotel for one week while we were in London. Everything about the hotel exceeded our expectations! The entire staff was friendly, accommodating and personable - especially the concierge, Andrea and the doorman, Steven. They helped us find the best restaurants, sights, bus routes and everything in between to help make our trip to London easy and unforgettable.   I would recommend The Milestone to anyone looking to stay in London!"
April 2017,Vacation and London tour,"A terrific hotel to stay. It was centrally located right across from Kensington Palace. The hotel decor was fantastic, the hotel staff proffesional, courteous and friendly. The room we had for our 5 day visit was very comfortable and well laid out. The restaurant and bar were excellent with terrific food and service. My wife and I travel quite a lot and I have not stayed in such a terrific hotel. We have been spoiled and will likely never be lucky enough to stay in such a great hotel again. I would highly recommend the Milestone Hotel to anyone. Great job done by all the hotel staff."
February 2017,Attentive service,"Multiple stays at the Milestone, always with pleasure and gratitude for the high level of attention and the kindness of the staff.  The public rooms are gracious; breakfasts are wonderful; the rooms are comfortably appointed.  The spa/gym area is small, but efficiently organized."
February 2017,Top hotel,"We spend four nights at this hotel.  It deserves its high ranking.  We had Room 105 - pretty much adjacent to the elevator, but you did not hear it.  The room was reasonably spacious for London.  Nice TV with many channels.  The bathroom was very large and very well appointed.  Spectacular is a good word to describe the bathroom.  We used the hotel as a base for sightseeing.  It's about a five minute walk to the Kensington High Street tube stop.  Very nice neighborhood between the hotel and the tube.  The staff was very professional.  We did not partake in any of the amenities offered by the hotel, but I would expect that they are first rate.  We arrived after 11 PM and registration was prompt and without incident.  It was quite cold outside, but the hotel and our room were well…"
February 2017,Wow. We're spoiled forever. ,"We're still here (me with my 16-yr old son) and may never leave. At the very least, I can assure you we may never have an experience like this again. What a hotel! Or, as the spectacular staff refers to it, our ""home."" This is 5 star luxury, with almost more than we can handle in terms of service.  Rooms are spotless and inviting. We're walking and standing all day, and to come back to this magnificence is just delightful!  The staff is perfect. Every one of them is prepared to help in any and every way. Then we have the amenities including the perfect beds, oversized towels, giant screen TV, a newspaper delivered each morning, and the stillness that allows for a nap when needed.   This place is a treat. "
January 2017,Ooh yea,-Exceptional customer service. Staff is super friendly and superprofessional   -Great design of rooms and lobby. The overall ambiance is on a noticeably high level.  -Great facilities such as swimming pool and GYM  -Location is very convenient
February 2017,Any excuse to experience the friendly atmosphere!,"I am lucky to have the opportunity to visit the Milestone Hotel fairly regularly! ALWAYS such a friendly welcome from all the personnel. If you find yourself in the Kensington area and want a delightful break from the hustle & bustle of the great city - Visit the Milestone Hotel - just for a coffee, a visit to the bar or a delightful meal all served by professional and FRIENDLY staff. (Or of course just to pass the  time of day with Patricio at the door)  "
April 2016,Gorgeous hotel in superb location,"Stayed at the Milestone for our wedding anniversary. The staff were sure to notice our anniversary, we were left with lovely goodies in the room on arrival.   Hotel is in a fantastic location right opposite Kensington gardens.  Will be back again!"
April 2016,Best hotel in London,"I stayed at the Milestone awhile back and completely forgot to give it a review.  The Milestone is, by far, the best hotel in London. The service is top-notch and second to none. They went out of their way to ensure we were happy with every aspect of our stay. The rooms are very large (by London standards) and tastefully decorated in a traditionally formal manner. We had dinner at the hotel restaurant and it was fantastic. The location also cannot be beat.  All in all - this is one of my favorite hotels in the world. It's like stepping back in time :-). "
February 2017,Exceptional Service,"If you are looking to be in a large hotel, this is not the place for you, but if you are looking for a taste of London at its finest -  the Milestone deserves a worthy mention for exceptional service.  Since we first arrived everything has been impeccable.  For us what makes this hotel stand out from the rest is the level of personal service from everyone we have encountered so far - from Leo who booked my room, Clea who met us at the door and who made sure our stay was enjoyable, the doormen, the wait staff everyone has been friendly and helpful.  Five stars all the way for this"
January 2017,The friendliest hotel ever!,"I have travelled a lot but I have never received such welcoming and friendly treatment from a hotel as the Milestone!  From the open bar due to our rooms not being ready (it was new years day and guests were late to leave) to the smiles and friendly manner of the staff throughout our 9 night stay, it was almost like staying with long lost family.  In fact one staff member suggested we treat the hotel as our home.  The staff were amazing you could not fault them and the rooms were lovely and comfortable.    Our stay was more memorable  when another guest made one night quite unbearable (no fault of the hotel and not despite their best efforts to shut the guest down).  The manager moved us to the largest suite in the hotel (the Tudor Suite). It more than made up for a bad night's…"
February 2017,Not enough great words to describe the Milestone,"The Milestone has been on my bucket list of hotels for several years.  I had very high expectations, and I was not disappointed!  We booked a car from the hotel to pick us up at the airport.  Our driver, Colin, was great!  He made us feel very welcome and gave us lots of information on the ride to the hotel.  When we checked in, we were told we had been upgraded to a deluxe king room.  The room was so quaint and charming, and the decor was perfect for us!  The room overlooked Kensington Gardens.  It was delightful to look out over the park every morning and evening. I had read so many glowing reviews about the hotel staff, and all of them proved to be true!  From housekeeping to the front desk, the concierge to the restaurant staff, they are all so friendly and ready help.  We…"
September 2016,Milestone Hotel,"Simply suberb, there is nothing about this place that isn't first rate, including the daily rate but if you want the best you have to pay for it.  It is a little cheaper for Americans now that the pound is down.  Nice location, right across the street from Kesington Gardens"
September 2016,Amazing Stay!,"My husband and I stayed at the Milestone Hotel for 3 nights.  While there, we were treated like royalty!  It was our 28th Anniversary so while we were out, they had put rose petals on our bed in the shape of a heart and also left some delicious chocolates!  Candles were lit in both the bedroom and bathroom.  Food was also excellent.  The staff, especially Patricio made our stay incredible. This trip was booked through Costco Travel. Thanks to all the staff at the Milestone for a most memorable stay!"
September 2016,Extraordinary Hotel!,"My husband and I stayed at the Milestone for four nights during our recent visit to London. What a treat! Everything about our visit was perfect. Our room was beautifully decorated, the bathroom was updated with a great shower, the food was delicious and the service was impeccable. After a day of traveling, the complimentary cocktail on our arrival was just what we needed. This is truly a unique, service-oriented, luxury hotel. We look forward to returning to the Milestone; our new favorite hotel in London."
October 2015,"Pleasure trip, birthday ","This was three years ago & our first trip to London, bottom line, if you are staying @ this end of london please stay @ the milestone hotel, if you are staying in the center of london please stay @ the ritz, two perfect hotels in a perfect & entertaining & safe city & by the way use the tube & please go to a play "
September 2016,Amazing stay,Stayed at milestone for five days was impressed by the friendly and helpful staff who took care of every aspect with precision and warmth The food was excellent and the pancakes and waffles for breakfast were delicious  The property by itself was amazing and the interiors beautiful Would love to go back again!!!
September 2016,Impeccable,"I did not stay here but visited the hotel for a business meeting followed by drinks in the Stables bar. This hotel is a hidden gem- oozing charm, luxury and character but without being overly stuffy too. All the staff were unbelievable. Cocktails in the bar were out of this world- you must try the old fashioned- the way it is served it awesome! It's quiet and hidden away- thought twice about writing this review- like to keep it hidden and quiet- shhh :)"
September 2016,A Lovely London Honeymoon at The Milestone,"My wife and I had a four night stay in the Harlequin Suite for our honeymoon.  We had a wonderful time at the Milestone Hotel.  It was a pleasure to be in a quieter part of town with easy access to tourist attractions, the Kensington Gardens, and Central London.  The staff, (especially the concierge), made us feel like part of the Milestone family.  We look forward to having the chance to go back and visit London soon.  I would highly recommend this hotel!"
June 2016,First Class Hotel,"We have stayed at the Milestone three times, with the experience getting better each time. The rooms are amazing and beautifully decorated.  My family and I returned to the Milestone in June and we felt like we were returning to our own private hotel, with every one of the staff making my family feel special.  When returning from a long day of sightseeing, the staff will give you a warm welcome and inquire about your day.  It is a boutique hotel with first class facilities, dining and staff.  When in London, we much prefer to stay at the Milestone Hotel, which is very special to my family."
September 2016,Treated Like Royalty!,"A big ""thank you"" to the wonderful staff at the Milestone!  You made my Mom's ""milestone"" birthday a magnificent occasion.  The service was impeccable, the accommodations are beautiful, and the restaurant is world class.  Every member of the staff is kind and helpful; they sincerely cannot do enough for you!  As far as hotels are concerned, the Milestone is absolute perfection.  We loved the Milestone so much that it will be our home away from home when in London.  And, to that end, we have already booked our return visit."
September 2016,Hard to fault - top of the pile,"In a city with so many very good hotels, The Milestone manages to stand high, and certainly up there amongst the greats.   We have just enjoyed a 2 night weekend in London, and it was our first stay at The Milestone - and we sincerely hope to return.   Just about faultless, this property and its staff set and achieve very high standards, but do so in an understated and very warm, welcoming way.   A gem in central London - thank you. "
October 2016,The Milestone Hotel to the Rescue,"We arrived in London on a rainy Saturday night after an arduous flight from Rome. Our taxi took us to the hotel where we had our booking arranged located in Bloomsbury. We were ready to unpack and relax after a long day. We were greeted instead by a hotel that was boarded up and closed for renovation. We had never been notified inspite of having a confirmed booking. Time to scramble with a taxi meter running! I had stayed at The Montague on the Garden, a Red Carnation Hotel, previously; so we went there since it was nearby. They had no rooms available but offered to call The Milestone. We accepted their offer of a room on the spot. The idea of driving around London on a Saturday night in the rain trying to find a hotel did not appeal. After a 150 GBP cab fare we arrived at The…"
July 2016,A Highlight of our Vacation!,"Family of 3 with an 11 year old boy. We arrived in a taxi and when the doorman opened the door, he greeted us by name. They had no idea when we were arriving (and presumably no idea what we looked like). That first impression properly set the stage for a two-night stay in one of the only hotels we have ever raved about. Truthfully, we found the room slightly small, but everything else was 6-star service. Amazingly friendly staff who knew us, multiple people who bent over backwards to assist us with dinner and travel reservations, personal care appointments, the works. Bartenders remembered what we like to drink. Maid service added special touches for each of us. The Milestone was simply amazing up and down. And even when they were fully booked for the afternoon tea, they created…"
October 2016,A wonderful experience,"My husband and I recently spent 2 nights at The Milestone and had a marvelous stay. I selected the hotel due to its proximity to The Royal Albert Hall as we had tickets to a performance. We had previously stayed at other Red Carnation properties so were familiar with the high standard of service and attention to detail, again we were not disappointed. From our initial welcome to our final goodbye the staff were superb - professional, courteous and could not do enough to assist. Our room was comfortable and cosy with so many well thought out details and the bathroom very spacious and well stocked. I loved the nightly turn down service with different sweets left each night. Breakfast was excellent and on our second morning  4 couples arrived at once to an already busy dining room…"
October 2016,Exceptional Stay,"From the moment my wife & I entered the Milestone we were overwhelmed by the courtesy of all the staff. An example & a fantastic gesture was an immediate upgrade in room, due to our Silver Wedding Anniversary celebration (thank you once again).  The attention to detail tells you everything about this Hotel, spotless, articulate, precise and thoughtful. (Rose petals and candles in the bedroom on the night of our anniversary was lovely).  Ideally located for the Royal Albert Hall, the Tube and Kensington Gardens this is an exceptional hotel. "
October 2016,The Milestone Hotel,"The hotel, opened in the 1920s, takes its name from the old cast iron milestone that stands outside and comprises three tall Victorian townhouses, the first of which, No 1 Kensington Court, has fine original features, including carved window frames and a black-and-white tiled floor. It stands on busy Kensington Road, near where it becomes Kensington High Street, with views of Kensington Park opposite. The hotel is small scale: with minimal outside space, cosy public rooms, including a very pretty Victorian style sitting room, and bedrooms on five floors. The decoration, in the style of Red Carnation’s owner and chief designer, Beatrice Tollman, is expansive, generous and elaborate, spilling over into fussiness, especially in such a small space, with flowing fabrics, cushions,…"
October 2016,Wouldnt stay anywhere else in London!,"We stayed for my husbands 50th birthday, and it was fantastic. We were upgraded on arrival. Staff friendly, attentive and there to please the guests (they are passionate about their jobs, and this shows in the level of service received from all)  The rooms are beautifully luxurious, scrupulously clean, and everything has been considered to make your stay wonderful. Turn down service with nightly treats, stunning Penhaligon toiletries and anything extra thats required is seen to immediately.  A  complimentary birthday cake was left in our room, and a birthday card, we also had complimentary champagne during our afternoon tea. A truly magical stay......thank you."
October 2016,Exceptional Service!,"Everything about the Milestone was beyond our greatest expectations.  I have traveled many places and stayed in 5 star hotels but this trip was extra special.  Everything from the location, staff and rooms were top notch.  I am a stickler for customer service and The Milestone staff did not disappoint.  They are amazing!  We stayed for 8 nights and never got tired of the fantastic breakfasts and the delicious evening treats.  I highly recommend the chicken pot pie."
October 2016,"Professional, personalized, and posh","Booked a stay at this hotel for an anniversary trip to London and we absolutely enjoyed our stay from start to finish. Our original booking was upgraded for us as a nice ""anniversary present"" and we couldn't have been more pleased. Our room had a king-sized bed, large flat screen tv, large closet and dresser, and bathtub large enough to soak in. I'm not sure if they have an evening maid service, but it was so nice to come home after a day of sightseeing to find that our slippers were set out by the bed, an evening treat on the coffee table, and soft music playing for us.   The location is a short walk to the Kensingston High Street underground station and all our taxi drivers knew of the hotel which made coming back home incredibly easy. Across from the hotel is Kensington…"
October 2016,Business or Pleasure Always Exceptional,"Have stayed here 3 times each time surpassing the previous stay for comfort, location, room quality and staff The Cheneston offers superb cuisine, prepared and plated masterfully. Many nights ended with a Vintage Port in the Bar The staff go out of their way to meet every request with a smile and prompt solution! All in all a superb stay every time.   And I love Kensington!!!!"
October 2016,Our favorite London hotel,"The Milestone is our go-to hotel on every visit to London. It is exquisite and the staff and service are exemplary.  It's hard to describe the wonderful experience that the Milestone provides and the quality and decor of it's accommodations. It well deserves its five star rating and while, like much of London, it is expensive, we have found that they do offer deals and have been upgraded on each visit.  Their restaurant is of high quality as is their high tea and evening lounge. Located directly across from Kensington Palace and Park, the home of William and Kate and in the shopping and restaurants of Kensington."
July 2016,London Break,"We have been staying at this hotel for years averaging better than one stay per year - the Milestone has never failed to deliver outstanding value. For those looking for a small, intimate, boutique-type hotel that feels more like ""home"" than a hotel, that is well situated for restaurants and the ""Tube"" and with excellent service, this is the place for you.   Much of the staff is long term and they know how to deliver great service. The bar and restaurant are both excellent. Though the address lists Kensington Court, the hotel is actually located on bustling Kensington High Street right across the street from the entrance to Kensington Gardens - so very quite. Walk a 100 yards on the streets leading behind the hotel and it's like entering another world: residential, quite,…"
June 2016,Majestic milestone,"The red carnation group headed by  bea tollman is renowned for its luxury ,attention to detail and ordinal guest relations . Having frequented their 12 apostles in Cape Town  and oyster box / Umhlanga and the Rubens of London ! The milestone delivers !! The cuisine  and  high tea is impeccable . Location is amazing - opposite Kensington gardens - close to central London shopping and sights - well worth a stay !"
August 2016,Exceptional,"I would tell others not to bother with any other hotel in London, but then I would probably never be able to stay myself. We have stayed here a few times now, and quite frankly, it is the best hotel in London.  We ate out at the Dorchester on Saturday, I cant comment on the rooms, but the ambience has nothing compared to this hotel.  It is such a treat to stay here, the staff are superb, attentive without being intrusive, and willing to go the extra mile.  We ordered room service after being at Lord's all day. Not wanting a full meal, just something light, I would be reluctant to do this anywhere else, but at the Milestone, the menu on room service is superb. To top it all we had a fabulous room, a piece of tranquillity in the middle of busy London. My advice, don't bother with…"
June 2016,Summer holiday in London,"We have stayed at large 5-star and other boutique hotels around the world and have to say the Milestone and Red Carnation brand's dedication to service and comfort are among the best.  There we three of us on the trip, my wife and I and our 18 year old son.  We were celebrating his graduation and her birthday.  Every element of our stay was perfect beginning with the car service that picked us up to the butler and concierge teams to the hotel room staff.  We stayed in a junior suite and used a european roll-a-way which was a bed next to our master for our son.  The room was very spacious and we weren't tripping over each other.  The room's appointments were fantastic, quiet and absolutely stunning.  We made plans for Wimbledon, the changing of the guard, and other key sites…"
July 2016,Our new 'favourite London hotel!',"An unexpected treat, selected purely on this occasion, for proximity to The Albert Hall. A hotel where nothing is too much trouble. Small but not lacking in character or service.The staff are helpful, friendly and approachable. Our Guest Room, comfortable, quiet, extremely well appointed and spacious - by London standards. Our only grievance was the lack of tea making facilities in the room. Once mentioned, they promised to supply one on our next visit. Unfortunately only one night's stay on this trip, but it certainly won't be our last. This is one of the very few hotels at which we felt as relaxed and comfortable as we do at home."
July 2016,A delightful High Tea ,"Enjoying high tea at the restaurant was one of the high points of our visit to London!  This traditional experiences in a very classy setting is well worth the price. All the food was delicious and the service very friendly. The sandwitches, cakes and scones left us well satisfied.  "
August 2015,Great hotel even better staff!,I had the pleasure of staying here for 6 nights during my stay in London and each one of them was memorable.  The doorman Steve was the best!  He was able to help with many facets of the trip from recommending off the beaten path pubs to try for lunch to ensuring I had an appointment at G F Trumper for a shave.  I will definitely be staying here for my next trip to London.
June 2016,"Warmth, Elegance, Lovely Location","Our travel agent suggested this hotel.  What a great suggestion!  We arrived in the morning before the room was ready.  We were offered an upgrade (nice surprise) and directed to the sitting room with comfy couches, tea and breakfast items.  I had been prepared to be grouchy after the overnight flight - but was so pleased with the treatment that I could only be pleased!   The rooms are lovely, the dinner in the restaurant was great, and the staff - from the doorman to the concierge to the front desk ... all were attentive, helpful, and professional."
July 2016,Very  friendly and nice,We just got back from a trip celebrating my wife's birthday and after reading the great reviews that this hotel had I decided to change our reservation  from a different hotel that we have booked .  we were definitely very impressed and happy  friendly atmosphere and great staff .  Location was great  July 2016
June 2016,Luxury place,"Ultra luxury hotel, the staff are amazing and the view great. for the price you get more than you would expect .Our room overlooking the pool was a good fit for us. Minimal sound comes into the room from outside. They have an evening lounge that opens in that area til about 2am. Kindly recommendation"
August 2016,Great service with attention to detail,From the moment of Rrival the staff made us feel right at home.   The bedrooms and hotel are both beautifully appointed.  Wifi service works without a glitch.   The high marks for the trip however goes to the concierge staff.   They helped us plan our day-to-day activities and continued to plan for us even while we were gone for the day.  The location is great and only waking distance from the Kensington palace and one block from the public transit station. We highly recommend this hotel and look forward to coming back on a future trip.
July 2016,Outstanding Service,We were staying at the Milestone for the first time as we joined friends who are regular guests. The hotel was elegant and our room - up in the roof was both charming and comfortable. The breakfasts were excellent and set us up for the day - which means I cannot tell you about either lunch or dinner at the Milestone. We did however enjoy bar food and drinks in the evening and found the conservatory a very civilised place to watch the Euro final. What really sets this hotel apart however is the staff. Everyone goes out of their way to help and assist. They are all delightful and are the secret to this hotel's overall charm. We will definitely coming back as soon as we can.
August 2016,Wonderful service and good location,"The Milestone prides itself on customer service, and did not disappoint. All the staff were very helpful, and worked to accommodate special requests. The food was good (we only had tea and breakfast, not dinner). One odd thing was that our room (#104) had no place to unpack small clothing - no chest of drawers, and only one small shelf in the closet. We had been looking forward to not living out of our suitcases for our 3 night stay, but unfortunately couldn't do that. I don't know if the other rooms have drawers or shelves, but perhaps they could fix it because it seemed odd for such an upscale hotel."
August 2016,Sorry to leave...and plan to return ,"The Milestone was recommended by our travel agent, who assured us that this would be a nice hotel in a good location.    The hotel proved to be much more.   We were immediately given a tour of the facility by Clea who was extremely personable, and a rush was put on getting our room ready, as we arrived a couple of hours before standard check-in time.    Our rooms were not large, but not cramped, which is all we expect from a hotel in a crowded city such as London or NYC.   Everything was in working order, and turndown service with a delicious late night snack was provided daily.  Breakfast was included and delicious each morning.    The concierges, especially Andrea, were phenomenal.  They were knowledgable and would help with anything needed.  We called Andrea for a private…"
August 2016,"""We are your home away from home.""","The title of this review is a direct quote from the desk person who checked us in.  He wasn't kidding.  This is a luxury, 5-star, expensive hotel, so you expect it to be great.  It was MORE than great because the people were so nice, friendly and helpful. Sometimes high-end London hotels can be stuffy.  Not the Milestone!  The opposite was true and staff is obviously given the permission -- and time -- to converse with guests.  We stayed there twice (at beginning and end of a trip to England).  We had a wonderful room both times, upgraded to a junior suite both times because we booked through Virtuoso, which offers upgrade if available.  Our suites each time were totally different and both very comfortable with sumptuous baths (though I would have liked a shower separate from…"
August 2016,Amazing,"I have stayed in the Milestone on numerous occasions and absolutely love it here. My hubby booked this as a surprise for my 60th before we flew to Dubai. If I had to go home after my stay here I would not have worried. We were very kindly given an upgrade to the lovely Safari suite. Sooo comfortable with the best bed ever. We had breakfast on both mornings. Excellent We ate here the 1st night and done the afternoon tea on the 2nd day both were delicious. Tasty canapés were served in the bar. Staff are fantastic and they truly make this hotel what it is, they really go the extra mile. Thank you to Steven on the door for you little chats and to Leo who gave us a tour of the hotel and then took us to our room. It truly is like a home from home and I could go on and on but just…"
August 2016,Lovely!!!, I have stayed at many hotels in most continents. This place holds a special place in my heart. Last time I was here I was away from home on a super sad trip during Christmas  and the genuine attention I received  from the staff was outstanding  and went way beyond my expectations. Not only did they go above in beyond in what I expect from a hotel but they took it to a whole level by treating me with genuine decency during a very emotional time for me. I can't say enough good things about this place.
July 2016,"Loved this hotel, did not want to leave",We spent 3 nights at the wonderful Milestone.  The staff here is the best!  They treated us so well!  We were there during some of the hottest days of the year and they made me the best ice tea I have had in a long time.  They were so friendly and attentive.  We enjoyed visiting with them and they truly enjoyed visiting with us.  Breakfast was delicious and there was so much variety.  The room was beautiful and it was so nice to enjoy such a wonderful meal there.  The wait staff were friendly and personable and did a great job serving us.  The concierge was always willing to help and gave us suggestions for dinner and made reservations for us.  The doorman always greeted us.  We can not say enough good things about this hotel or the many people that work there! We are so glad we…
July 2016,The excellent Milestone Hotel,"I have stayed in five star hotels throughout the world, and the Milestone Hotel was one of the best I have experienced! It was luxurious,elegant,  comfortable, and the staff tried to anticipate every need. The concierge was especially knowledgeable and helpful, and the food was also excellent. I highly recommend the Milestone Hotel to anyone traveling to the London area."
June 2016,The ultimate British hospitality,"For travelers who wish to experience a real authentic British experience that you read about in story books, the Milestone hotels delivers it big time.  From traditional breakfast and tea, this gem has it all.  It is not a big grand cookie-cutter hotel with a massive lobby full of tourists but a nice boutique property that's a home away from home. Service is outstanding and décor grand with all the modern amenities, wifi, etc."
September 2016,Fantastic first stay in London,"We originally wanted to stay at another hotel, but landed at The Milestone and what an amazing surprise it turned out to be. The staff is incredible, cordial and very polite (everything you would expect from a 5-Star). The rooms are fantastic, quaint, and no two rooms are the same. The details made the difference for us. Little things like a personal note from the Hotel Manager and daily cards with the weather for the next day. A lot of hotels could learn about customer service from The Milestone Hotel. We would highly recommend the full tea service. Book it the day you arrive and prepare for the full experience. We cannot wait to return. "
August 2016,Felt like a valued guest,"We enjoyed our time in London in large part due to this hotel.  Their staff is incredible - from the doorman to the front desk to the concierge, the housekeeping staff, the breakfast greeters/servers - their people set them apart. It wasn't the least expensive hotel but the rooms were spacious, their staff was professional, the location was fantastic - close to a metro stop, the tube, as well as one of those hop on/hop off bus stops. WIFI was great. When we were making arrangements to leave we asked that a cab be arranged to take us to the train station and it was important to us that it was one that took credit cards as we didn't want to have to exchange more currency for a simple cab ride.  The bellman got us the cab, told us they accepted credit cards, got us in the cab and…"
June 2016,"Feeling ""at home"" in London","The Milestone Hotel is perfect in every respect if you are looking for a small hotel with an ""at home"" feeling in central London.  All the staff, without exception, were warm, welcoming, polite, respectful and helpful.  My room was beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean.  Breakfast was, without doubt, the best I have ever had in any country in the world.   In addition to the standard full English breakfast, there was a glorious selection of other breakfast fare available in an adjacent room.   It is close to shops, parks, restaurants, museums and The Albert Hall."
July 2016,"Our ""new"" number one choice in London!","Having stayed at The Savoy, The Dorchester, and lovely private homes in Holland Park, we now choose The Milestone as ""the place to stay"" when visiting London.  We have rarely experienced customer service and attention to detail like we did at The Milestone.  The location is perfect, the staff friendly and knowledgable, and the rooms simply beautiful.  Make sure you take some time to enjoy the bar, whether it's for tea or something stronger, as the people are friendly and the atmosphere just wonderful!  "
September 2016,A True Delight,"A perfect location with exemplary service. From Fabrizio at breakfast to Andrea at the concierge desk to Marco at the bar, everyday was perfection. We felt so welcome, had a fabulous time and can't wait to come back."
May 2016,"Lovely, but overpriced?","I loved the Milestone and the staff were faultless, but we booked two rooms thinking we would have a view of Kensington Palace but instead, had a brick wall view. For AU$550+ a night (without breakfast) it was a bit rich. Although the hotel was lovely (smallish room at our entry level price) and the staff were delightful, I would stay elsewhere next time as it was pushing $1.5-2k a night for the Palace and Park outlook."
August 2016,A wonderful anniversary stay,"We stayed at the Milestone for our anniversary. It was a beautiful and well run hotel with a staff that can not do enough for you. The rooms were beautiful and so clean. We were upgraded to a two floor suite overlooking Kensington Park. And when we returned to our room, the night of our anniversary, there were petals everywhere. Thank you Andrew Pike for a well run hotel."
July 2016,Beautiful Hotel in Great Location,"This beautiful boutique hotel is small and quiet and perfectly located close to good restaurants, high-end shopping, and a tube stop.  The rooms are small, but luxuriously decorated and furnished with every amenity.  In addition, the showers were wonderful and the beds were marvelously comfortable!  We were there for five nights and the staff was so helpful and attentive -- assisting us with tickets, arranging rides to and from the airport, and recommending restaurants.  My first choice in London!"
August 2016,Very British,This is an excellent property.  The staff is impeccable.  Service is outstanding.  The room was very comfortable.  The hotel is in an excellent location near the south west corner of Hyde/Kensington Park.  There is good access to transportation and many dining options that varied from fast food to fine dining.  This is an older/classic building that is in outstanding condition.  The breakfast was delicious.  A bit pricey but the quality was delivered.  We arrived after check in time and our room was not ready.  The front desk provided a very nice room for us to rest and refresh after our long transatlantic flight.  When our room was ready our things were transferred.  This was handled in a most professional way.  You will find a very well trained professional staff.
August 2016,Mrs kitchener,"We booked in on the 26th of August 2016 for our 10th year anniversary I must it was a very wonderful, posh and classy experience we were upgraded to Tudor room very posh and sophisticated, decorated with roses and petals, a welcoming complimentary champagne. Buffet breakfast in the room, the hotel very clean truly a five star experience, I would recommend this hotel 100 percent and I can't wait to go back there."
July 2016,Fabulous family-friendly stay,"I spent two glorious nights at the Milestone with my two boys and cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. From the unexpected upgrade to a larger room, to delicious treats for the boys, from the booking of a lovely sitter for our boys to games and water each time we walked out the door to scooter in Kensington Gardens, their staff was fabulous, responsive and so welcoming. The hotel is beautiful as well as extremely comfortable. We were made to feel as if it was our home in London and what a location directly across from Kensington Gardens! A perfect spot for families. We cannot wait for our next trip to London and our stay at The Milestone! "
July 2016,Lovely,"The Reason We picked this hotel was the location and the reviews, so because of this are expectations were high. We arrived and checked in no issues, we were shown to our room and it was lovely but a little cramped. We unpacked then thought we'd take a nap. The stains on the bed base and headboard were questionable. I felt unhappy as I was disappointed. My husband went and quietly spoke to manager and he came to the room to look. He immediately himself was shocked and stated that this had been overlooked and moved us immediately to a junior suite! The door man and concierge moved all our belongings so we didn't have to do it. The guest recovery was immediate and exceptional. Breakfast was amazing and a treat every morning. Our friends arrived the day after and loved it to. The…"
July 2016,"Negvesky, MD","The Milestone is hands down, one of the finest hotels in entire UK.  The hotel exudes British tradition and elegance--exactly how I wanted my US based family to experience true British culture.  The staff at this boutique hotel are brilliant--- geniuses in hospitality.   Shortened our stay at the Royal Crescent in Bath, when our oldest daughter developed a respiratory illness. We rushed back to Milestone, where they had arranged a first class Private Physician to examine my daughter on our arrival to the hotel in our own room.  We were out of our country and really needed guidance and immediate help, although we were in Bath, the Milestone Managment was the first placed we turned and trusted in an emergency situation----it was a blessing to have the amazing staff of a hotel take…"
June 2016,A Great Hotel Experience,"The Milestone is a wonderful boutique hotel across from Hyde Park.  We were greeted warmly at the car and again by the front desk.  All of the staff are helpful and very nice.  Everyone seemed to genuinely care that we had a remarkable stay. The hotel is beautiful and fascinating.  There is every modern convenience in the setting of an elegant, sort of art deco hotel.  Our room was spacious (Jr. suite), with a balcony and a glorious bathroom!  I highly recommend this location and hotel."
July 2016,Best Hotel in London,"I cannot express in words how magnificent our short stay was at The MIlestone hotel in London.  It was truly the best three days of our two week European vacation.  The individual attention to detail by every single member of their staff is incredible! From the welcoming gifts, to the attention we received on our late arrival at 2am, the daily room service and wonderful breakfast, the delicious surprise birthday cake delivered when we were experiencing afternoon tea at the hotel and my complimentary bottle of birthday champagne, to the concierge desk sending up Pokemon cupcakes to my daughters’ room after discussing the new Pokemon Go app around the city earlier in the morning.  We always felt like we were the only the guests in the hotel despite the other guests around us. …"
July 2016,Amazing stay at the Milestone,"Great service, amazing staff, and great location made for an amazing stay.  Would completely recommend the Milestone for a romantic weekend or ideal location to see the parks and sites of the west side of London."
June 2016,"High quality and fantastic location, but overpriced?","The Milestone is a very good hotel in all aspects: Excellent location, good service, and good standard throughout. However, good is not excellent. The hotel lacks the special touch and very attentive service level you would expect at a hotel of this standard. The price promises excellence, but the experience is not fully there. So what you eventually pay for is good comfort and quality at a fantastic location - close to everything in London."
July 2016,Simply the BEST!!,We stayed at the Milestone for six nights and LOVED it!  The service was exceptional from our very first contact prior to our stay until the second we walked out the door.  Everyone at the Milestone went above and beyond to assure our satisfaction!   Great location right across the street from Kensington Palace and Hyde Park.  We had an absolutely wonderful experience and a great time!
July 2016,incredible,This is overall the best hotel stay. absolutely impeccable!!! It was the first tim that I stayed in this hotel. I hope to come back very soon in London to stay another time in this place. Good job guys!
July 2016,Attentive service ,"We stayed at the Milestone over a weekend, from Friday to Monday. The customer service is really on the ball and they allowed us to check in early, which was great after an early flight. Dinner in the restaurant was excellent and the service in the bar is really professional. The room was a little disappointing though, stains on the walls where the air con is and all of the furniture was getting tired. It also had a dull drone from the lift ( although not bad enough to lose sleep but ask for a room away from the lift) and the faint aroma of old cigarette smoke. Also, no power point in the bathroom, aside from the usual shaving socket which was a little annoying.... Still, given the excellent service, most of this can be forgiven and the hotel is one of the better places I have…"
April 2016,Always charming with superior service,"We stayed in the apartments this April for the entire month. The apartments are attached to the Milestone and they have their own door in the foyer so that you can enter and exit without going through the lobby. We had groceries delivered several times while there. The hotel handled it perfectly. There was new staff this time with notable learning bumps (consistency with room service was an issue). The newer staff made minor variations to menu items. When you find something that's wonderful to eat, changing it isn't a good thing. Example - eggs benedict plate differed based on who took the order. Staff that had been there longer didn't have this issue. Everyone was friendly. There was one major issue with hot water in the apartment - we kept running out. With 4 adults showering,…"
June 2016,Can't wait to come back!,"We booked the Milestone based on Trip Advisor reviews and it absolutely exceeded expectations!! The staff goes the extra mile every day to make the hotel a home away from home. The attention to detail is incredible, the breakfast outstanding, and the service personal and impeccable. We were so comfortable and well cared for that I cried when we left! For future trips to London we won't stay in any other hotel!"
May 2016,Amazing service and experience!,"As we walked into the milestone we were given a tour of the hotel which was really good and interesting. We were then shown to our room and were offered welcome drinks and complementary biscuits made by the chef. The room was amazing and felt so luxurious, especially the bathroom! When we came back from our evening meal there was a cake left for me which shows that the hotel really cares about their guests. The breakfast was amazing! I had an English breakfast and my partner had eggs Benedict along with the continental breakfast. All the staff were so welcoming and made the stay amazing!   However, we did experience some difficulties with payment but I have gone to the bank to sort this out."
June 2016,Perfect for the Albert Hall,"Just five minutes from the Albert Hall, the Milestone Hotel is the perfect place to stay after a great show.  We stayed in the Safari Room with a view over the Park, service was friendly and attentive and we had an excellent meal in the hotel restaurant. There were a couple of nice touches, a free glass of champagne (Laurent Perrier) and a box of goodies in the room.  It was my wife's birthday and we were made to feel very special. "
April 2016,Heavenly hotel,"I chose the Milestone for its location.   Close to my business needs and Kensington Gardens, where I wanted to walk when I could.  I loved this hotel.  The staff was so warm and impeccably professional. I arrived late in the evening, and they offered me a glass of wine in my room, on the house.  How sweet! I never ate there, nor did their pricey (!) afternoon tea, but I enjoyed my stay immensely.  "
December 2015,"Amazing, Life's Greatest Moments Experience","This review is long overdue - our family stayed at the Milestone over Christmas 2015 for 8 days and I cannot say enough about this hotel.   The staff was absolutely impeccable and felt like family.   The General Manager, Andrew Pike, was amazingly accommodating and gracious to ensure that our every need was attended.  His staff from Andrea, the concierge, to Chris, the Sommelier to the doormen, to the maids, to the front desk - they were all amazing.   This was our first Christmas away as a family and it could not have been more memorable.   They brought the children hand-wrapped gifts on Christmas eve and Christmas morning and even delivered fully loaded stockings for the kids at midnight!  Every meal that we had at the hotel was wonderful and every evening we spent sleeping in…"
April 2016,The Best Afternoon Tea in London!,"We stayed at this beautiful hotel last August for our wedding anniversary and enjoyed a superb Afternoon Tea, so when we visited London again for a show and overnight stay, we booked for another late afternoon Tea before we travelled back home.  As usual the staff were very friendly and accomodating and nothing is ever too much trouble! The sarnies, cakes and scones were splendid and they made me scones without currants/raisins which were presented warm with lovely cream and jam. We couldn't eat it all, so they kindly boxed them up and took them home to enjoy.  We are going to stay at their sister hotel in Dorset, Summer Lodge in August for this years anniversary and really looking forward to yet another Afternoon Tea there!  Fabulous hotel, excellent service and staff!! Keep up…"
May 2016,The best hotel ever!,"It was simply amazing. All staff were excellent and couldn't have been more helpful, our room was beautiful and comfortable. The milestone ensured we had fantastic stay. They did this by just doing little things that had a huge impact on our stay such as arrival drinks, or the tour or even just holding doors open for us. During the stay has made us itching to come back, it's definitely my favourite place in the world. Couldn't have asked for better service!! Thanks to all staff."
May 2016,Hotel Worthy of Its Five Stars,"This is the second time I've stayed at the Milestone Hotel. The location is excellent, directly across the street from Hyde Park and Kensington Palace.  This is a truly lovely, small hotel.  The whole staff, from doormen to desk to concierge to room service,  is outstanding - courteous, warm and welcoming.  The rooms are appointed beautifully, the beds and pillows are outstanding and the bathroom was roomy and up-to-date.  We ate in the hotel restaurant on our first night, and it was good, but not great.  Service was excellent; food was ok.  Other than that slight negative, I have nothing but raves for this hotel."
April 2016,The Milestone Experience!,"My wife and I booked a stay here to celebrate our wedding anniversary. From the the first moment we stepped across the threshold to the time for our checkout the service from all the staff was exceptional and flawless. Nothing was too much trouble. After returning to the hotel on the first evening, the staff had decorated our room with rose petals and provided champagne and strawberries to add the finishing touch to a memorable day. Breakfast the following morning was a multitude of choices but I would heartily recommend the full English . We had dinner in the restaurant on the second night and this was well presented and delicious. All in all I we would recommend this hotel for it's excellent location, very helpful staff , comfortable and chic bedrooms and communal areas. We…"
July 2016,Great stay in London!!!!,Overall the best hotel stay. The staff welcomed us HOME everytime we returned.  The housekeeping staff picked up and replaced towel twice daily what a dream. Jose got us GREAT theatre tickets and made a wonderful resturant pick for Indian food. I would highly recommend and what a great location.
July 2016,Impeccable!,"My wife and I stayed at The Milestone for one night, partly to celebrate a wedding anniversary. The hotel was faultless. Every single member of staff was genuinely friendly and entirely professional. The room was perfect, as were all the little, unexpected touches, such as a chocolate cake to celebrate our anniversary; the mini books (abridged Shakespeare and Dickens) placed on our pillows at night; and even the card placed by our bed showing tomorrow's weather forecast.   Whilst this hotel is not cheap, there is no question that you get what you pay for here. The customer service was the best I had ever experienced at any hotel. We were immediately made to feel welcome and comfortable. We were treated as valued guests.   In short, this hotel is outstanding!"
July 2016,A Crown Jewel!,"This is a very special hotel with a great staff that makes everything possible. It has the dark wood inside and traditional decor which i was not sure about at first,  but loved it within a day. The staff is soooooo amazing!!! The front desk, Chloe is fantastic, the concierge and the bellmen, the kitchen(24 hours!) laundry service--all superb. They were excellent with my kids picky menu desires and made it happen. What a total pleasure!!! Thank you from my heart!!!"
December 2015,Quintessentially British,Perfect location across from Hyde Park in South Kensington. The Milestone is a boutique hotel with beautiful rooms and attentive staff. The back area bar was perfect for drinks or tea. Room service was available (even their late night menu after hours). Their Holiday decorations around Christmas are stunning. Have stayed here multiple times and would definitely go back.
July 2016,Fabulous Luxury Hotel,"Stayed here as attending a concert in Hyde Park, so an excellent location. Received complimentary drinks on arrival. Staff were really nice and helpful, and friendly, which you sometimes don't experience in a hotel of this standard. Rooms were first class. I unfortunately left my room in a hurry and left it untidy. When I returned everything had been tidied up. Luxury toiletries and slippers are also provided. We booked afternoon tea which was of a very high standard and included champagne. The waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the tea, sandwiches and cakes. We also had breakfast the following morning which again was first class and the selection included everything you could possibly want. This is a five star hotel so would not be affordable for everyone but it…"
July 2016,"Wonderful stay, just perfect!","I researched for hours before booking a hotel in London & was extremely satisfied with my choice. We stayed here for a week & the location is excellent. You can see all of the sites within a few tube or bus stops and then return to the tranquility of the Kensington Park area. Next, the staff went beyond to make our first trip to London an amazing experience for my daughter & I. The breakfast & afternoon tea were delicious and once again the staff of servers were so accommodating, they couldn't do enough for us. The staff took a genuine interest, particularly Clea & Chloe, in making sure every part of our stay was amazing. Clea even went so far as to writing my teenage daughter a beautiful card & leaving tennis decorated cupcakes in our room on the night we returned from…"
July 2016,This is the best small luxury hotel in the world ,"I have to travel for work all over the world so over the years I have been to some pretty fabulous hotels. But none match the Milestone.   I had my wedding here a few years ago and yesterday I hosted a party for 40 guests for my Mum. Everything was faultless and perfect. The food, staff, service, room and organisation was so good that it meant that I could relax and enjoy the special afternoon. The staff at this hotel seem to really care about what they do, and they care about their guests too. Nothing is too much.   In particular Grant Cockburn, food and beverage manager, and David and Augustine deserve special mentions. Grant was simply wonderful and actually he helped make my Mum's reception really special. I cannot thank the Milestone team enough. This is a very special…"
June 2016,Delightful,"We stayed here 4 nights in early June. My wife and I both thought this was our best trip to London, ever, and we credit our stay at the Milestone for our epic enjoyment of the city. I used to think that in places like London the hotel doesn't matter. That what's outside the hotel is all that matters. But London is such a large and busy city. It not only has a lot to give, but takes a lot out of you as well - energy, physical activity, brain activity, emotional activity, etc. Because this hotel is located across the street from Kensington Gardens, the gardens are basically your backyard and you can enjoy strolls along and in it at any time. it's a nice break from the plays, museums, monuments, and shopping. And the hotel itself is a bastion of respite, hospitality at it's best,…"
July 2016,How do they recruit such remarkable staff?,Just returned from this hotel. Didn't want to leave. All the team made you feel like a regular guest. As a first time visitor with a dog in tow we could not believe the warmth of the welcome. Chloe checked us in. Pedro showed us around. Benjamin served our dog friendly supper in the stylish conservatory. David served our afternoon tea which was superb. Marvin helped with umbrellas and bag storing. Leo checked us out.  We had a lovely chatty lady who brought us breakfast in the room.  Everything in the room worked beautifully. Even the Sky TV remote was in a sterilized bag! The hotel's attention to detail is meticulous but it was so casual and friendly that Nero was encouraged to sit on the sofa. Thank you to everyone who helped our stay along. Apologies if we missed you by name.…
June 2016,A brilliant hotel in a perfect location that feels like home,"We stayed in the 'Rooftops' apartment - Apartment 6. This is the only one that is effectively three bedroom, with the third bedroom being a lovely little loft room.   This apartment also has an excellent roof terrace that, like the rest of the apartment, is isolated from the noise of the main road and feels like a sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of London.  The staff are excellent, nothing is too much trouble.  Its an old building, meaning the rooms are smaller, the place has age (in a good way). We came to London to feel the history of the place, and this hotel lets you live within that history, in the nicest sense.  We've tried their great afternoon tea (do *not* eat lunch beforehand) and enjoyed their lovely breakfasts.  But it really is about location (unbeatable -…"
October 2015,simply the best,"Excellent location, confortable rooms, lovely atmosphere.   The Restaurant (Chenneston's) is high quality and gorgeous.  A remarkable afternoon tea which is offered in a very pleaseant lounge.  In a few words: Simply the Best!"
May 2016,A big birthday and the Dixie Chicks,"We recently spent a lovely weekend at the Milestone Hotel. It is sublime.  We arrived to a flurry of exceptional staff who took us to our room overlooking the park.  The rooms are luxurious. My husband was impressed with the amount of towels and the two different types of robe! Attention to detail is everywhere, from the biscuits to the monsoon shower head.  The quote of the weekend was ""everything is possible at the Milestone"" and that is true. If you ask lovely things happen. The husband struggled when ordering breakfast - eggs benedict or haddock. Have both says the waitress. And he did. Delicious.  One piece of advice is have the waffles. Heaven.  We will be back. And thank you to all at this gorgeous hotel. "
May 2016,"Pet Friendly, Welcoming 5* Hotel.","Have just returned from my second stay at the Milestone Hotel, what a treat.  The Milestone is a 5* hotel without the stuffiness that sometimes comes with that. Everyone was very welcoming and seemed genuinely pleased to see us. We initially picked the Milestone because it was a pet-friendly hotel and it certainly was. We travelled with our pet Labradoodle and there were no problems at all. The location is also great, just opposite Kensington Gardens. Highly recommended."
May 2016,Afternoon Tea,"A truly delightful experience. Our tea time was 3pm but we arrived early and shown into the lounge and made to feel very welcome. The whole experience was pure delight.  The service, the tea, the sandwiches, scones and cakes superb and surrounding perfect. Sitting in very comfortable, easy chairs it seemed a world away from the bustle outside in this park of Kensington. This is a small hotel but superb quality throughout and the staff so very friendly and welcoming and not stuffy as some five star hotels can be. Book afternoon tea here and experience this delightful English pleasure for yourself. You will not be disappointed."
June 2015,Absolutely perfect !,"The milestone hotel is in a class of its own . As soon as you walk into this hotel you feel at home , relaxed and welcome . The service in this hotel is 1st class all the staff very efficient and friendly . Our room was perfect and it faced the Kensington gardens we had an amazing view over the park . The bed was one of the comfiest I've ever slept in , the bathroom was stunning and the decor was immaculate. Everything about this hotel is perfect I would recommend it to anybody . Food is amazing , we had dinner , breakfast and afternoon tea while we were here and everything was sublime . Don't hesitate to book this hotel you will not be disappointed. Overall a 5 star hotel that is truely outstanding, my wife and I can't wait to return . "
May 2016,Peaceful with great servi,We stayed 4 nights wanting somewhere near the Albert Hall and Kensington. We had never before stayed at the Milestone but will return. The hotel is quiet with very attentive staff - after only a short while they all recognised us. The room was very comfortable and the bed was fantastic. We had continental breakfast each day which was extremely good and although we didn't eat dinner we did have a snack one evening in the Stables bar. Once again the food and service were very good indeed.   It's fair to say that we were not impressed by afternoon tea and mentioned it when we checked out. In very sharp contrast to most institutions the person doing the checkout took our comments on board and said they would follow up. The interesting thing is not only that they say they strive for…
July 2015,A Majestic Hostelry,"Absolutely oozing charm and refinement. Just a tiara's toss from Kensington Palace, home to Prince William and his wife Kate, the Milestone is an Edwardian home from home. Every room and suite has a different design, and Kensington High Street and Harrods are just a short walk away. A boutique hotel with great style!"
May 2016,Perfect!,"This was our second visit to The Milestone and  I hope it won't be our last. Every member of staff was welcoming,professional and committed to making our stay enjoyable. The room was gorgeous and the little extra touches such as the hand made biscuits made the experience extra special. The food was delicious and the complimentary canapés served with our drinks were great. We  highly recommend this hotel."
May 2016,The great reviews are true,"We were in the Mystinguette suite for 3 nights. The great reviews are true, this is a very elegant hotel with excellent hospitality. All the staff do a very good job making you feel at home. A special mention for Andrea, one of the conciërges, for excellent help arranging dinner and brunch at two different places.  We found the location fine, visiting the Tower, the Eye, Harrods and all sorts of sights in Chelsea and Knightsbridge. "
May 2016,4 Nights & 5 Stars!,"We enjoyed our 4 night stay in the Mistinguett suite to celebrate our anniversary before traveling onto Monte Carlo for another 4 nights at the Hotel Hermitage, a larger 5 star property.  We chose the Milestone for our time in London due to it's great location but mainly because of it's a smaller, boutique type hotel which was a great contrast to the Hermitage. After this trip,  we'll definitely be staying at more boutique type & Red Carnation properties.given our great experience at the Milestone.  Prior to arrival, we received an email requesting details like favorite colors, drinks, reason for visit, pillow menu, etc.  It's worth the time to fill this form out - the information was certainly put to good use by the staff.   Upon arrival we were greeted by the super friendly…"
June 2016,Friendliest boutique hotel in London,"Absolute gem. Beautiful surroundings and the friendliest staff. We were in London for a family vacation, spending a week in London and a few days in Paris. The Milestone did not disappoint. The folks there really cared about providing the best experience for our large group. There were twelve of us staying in six rooms and each of us felt like we were royalty. From Andreas help in planning our excursions to Head Doorman Steve Thornett's unmatched knowledge of the local surroundings, you will not find a better place to stay in London."
May 2016,Absolutely fabulous wedding anniversary stay....,"This was our second w/e away since our daughter was born 14m ago. From the minute we arrived the staff were exceptionally friendly and welcoming. The reception staff were helpful and made sure we were aware of all local amenities. We were given a tour of the hotel after which we had a relaxing welcome glass of champagne at the bar. The ambiance of the entire hotel is friendly and relaxing. We were upgraded to a suit which was absolutely fabulous. The bed was extremely comfortable... So much so we returned for an afternoon nap! The turn down service was the best we'd ever experienced and we have travelled a lot. When we returned to our room that evening we were greeted with a handwritten card and an array of complimentary chocolates, strawberries and hot drinks.  Our stay was…"
June 2016,Fabulous stay!,"i was lucky enough for my husband to book a stay at The Milestone (and to see Swan Lake at The Albert Hall a 10 minute walk away) as a birthday gift. My husband knows that The Milestone has become my favourite hotel. It is indeed a beautiful hotel, but what makes this really special is not just the lovely rooms and personal touches, it is the staff. All of whom are efficient, friendly, helpful, courteous and utterly charming. Everyone went out of their way to ensure that we had a special time. We were so absolutely stunned by an upgrade to The Regency Suite, which was positively gorgeous and we felt even more special. Whatever room you choose at The Milestone you will not be disappointed with The Milestone experience. Thank you again to all the staff for making my birthday gift…"
June 2016,Just as Fabulous after two years!!!,"We recently re-visited The Milestone after a two year break, and to our delight every last detail was exactly as we had remembered, from the welcome at the front door, through lunch, dinner, breakfast and our reluctant departure at Reception the next morning! we regard the hotel as an absolute treat and very much look forward to our next visit."
May 2016,Personal service in the heart of London,"I stayed at the Milestone Hotel for three nights in May 2016. I did ask for every discount imaginable at the time of booking and when I arrived, I was given a free upgrade to a Studio Room. It was just lovely. The big difference between this hotel and the others I stayed at while in London was the personal attention in the Lobby from the concierge, the doorman and the reception desk. The staff were really helpful, giving me tips and directions every morning. The hotel is an old home converted and so it's a very English place. Wonderful experience."
June 2016,What a treat!!,"Amazing personal attentive service. Made us feel like royalty. The food was to die for and the room immaculate. No detail left untouched... Beautiful toiletries, gorgeous decor, could not have picked a better place for hubbies 50th Borthday treat"
June 2016,Home from home in heart of London,"I cannot describe just how wonderful this hotel is. The staff are so friendly and welcoming treating as though you are a friend rather than a customer - and the service they provide is exceptional.  The room (Kensington Suite) was absolutely amazing - on split levels, beautiful decor & furnishings, overlooking the park & everything you could want for a very comfortable stay in London.  We had drinks in the bar (which used to be the stables) and sat in the conservatory, which was very pleasant.  In the evening we drank in the bar and this is cosy and comfortable.  The hotel is not huge like many of the hotels in London and the public rooms on the ground floor meander around so as you feel like you're in a home rather than a grand hotel. Breakfast was very good with a good choice…"
June 2016,In 40 years of travel to Europe I have found no better boutique hotel than London's Milestone.,"I can only imagine what the level of service must be directly across the famous Knightsbridge Road from the Milestone at Kensington Palace, the official residence of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. However I doubt it is better or friendlier than that at the Milestone. Rather than list superlatives let me just say that the ambiance, the rooms, and the restaurant are all 6 Star. In the forty years I have been visiting the UK I have never found a more comfortable, friendly, and luxurious hotel. The restaurant is outstanding I might. Those Americans who might be concerned about haughty or snooty behavior at such an elegant manse need not worry. Everyone is treatred equally regally. Absolutely the place to stay in London!"
May 2016,Caring Staff with Thoughtful Amenities,"Enjoyable one-night stay. Arrived after a long flight and the staff was helpful in getting us settled. Lots of small treats in the room (tea, cookies, etc.) and we appreciated the complimentary coffee with our wake-up call. Small but elaborately decorated room. Perhaps could use a little refreshing in some areas, but it's a historic hotel. Kensington area has a lot to offer and is closer to LHR than some other hotel options in the city."
January 2016,Wow! Now that's what I call service!,Fantastic service all around. We felt like royalty and experienced firsthand the famed British hospitality. The whole place had a charming and cozy feel to it while staying elegant at the same time. The staff are a great asset to this hotel! Stayed for more than a few days and not once had I even the smallest complaint. Thumbs up to the management and staff!
April 2016,"Red is the colour, carnation is the flower","This is the fifth time we have stayed at a Red Carnation hotel in London. Its always our choice of brand when we have no specific event planned.  The hotel, like the others in the chain where we have visited are all old buildings, superbly refitted. The room (deluxe king) has everything you might need in an emergency and more besides. Wonderfully comfortable bed and pillows.  But as always with this brand its that little extra: The staff are exceptional. Staff tell us they love working for Red Carnation and I believe them.  What else to add? Its all good."
May 2016,Splendid!,"Brought my daughter here for a four night stay in London. What a pleasure; the staff could not be more accommodating. Just a five minute walk to the High Street tube station. Very beautiful neighborhood. This is very much more like staying in your home, rather than at a hotel. You do pay a five star price for all this, but, you get a proportional experience. There is a lot of walking here, and, lots of stairs. The hotel is in excellent repair. However, the scale of things, hallways, elevators, bathrooms, is quite a bit smaller than in the US. The clientele is very much of a high caliber; quiet place with a very dignified air. Definitely would recommend for a luxury stay in London!"
April 2016,Cocktails in the Stable Bar,"We stayed in an apartment a couple of minutes walk from the Milestone Hotel.  We were looking for a nice place for cocktails and found the Stable Bar to be very inviting so we relaxed for a while.  The service was great and we ended up having snacks and a sandwich and a few additional cocktails.  We recommend this cozy spot if you want a quiet, lovely place."
April 2016,Beautiful Place Must See Memorable,"We were staying in an apartment half a block away on a recent trip to London, and the very first time we passed the hotel, my boyfriend and I remarked upon how absolutely adorable it was - a British porter outside in uniform, picturesque ivy- strewn gate, brick building.  We looked up the hotel online to see that its ranked #2 out of all the hotels in London, and while there wasn't much information on the website regarding Stables, the bar, we planned to drop by at some point, for a cocktail."
April 2016,Always excellent!,"We stay at The Milestone at least once a year. Each time the staff is overwhelming and excellent! It has become a home away from home for us. Try the Breakfast in the room, it's fantastic. Nearby Royal Albert Hall , Kensington Palace and the shops of Kensington High Street you have a lot of possibilities for shopping and leisure. "
April 2016,"Beautiful hotel, full of English charm","My husband and I stayed here for 4 days after finding the apartment we had booked was not at all what we expected.  We absolutely loved this hotel - the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, and went out of the way to make up for our previous disappointment, to ensure we left London with a positive experience. The room was absolutely charming, and we loved the fact that all the rooms were decorated differently - we stayed in the 'jungle' which had a beautiful private balcony!  We also ate in the restaurant one evening, and the food and service was wonderful.  We have definitely left London with a very positive impression, and will stay at the Milestone again. "
March 2016,Truly memorable,I took my mother to stay at The Milestone for a birthday treat and from the moment we arrived everything was made so wonderful for us. This truly was a night she will never forget. The staff were the most pleasant and helpful people you could wish to meet. The surroundings were just pure luxury. Everything about our stay here was amazing. I would gladly go back whenever I got the chance and would recommend the place to everybody I meet. Thankyou to everyone at The Milestone for making our trip simply the best experience ever.
February 2016,"Small Luxury Hotel, Top of the Line Service","Great hotel, great location.  Like living in a large, traditional mansion.  Attentive staff to cater to every need.  Excellent restaurant and bar facilities.  We will always return to the Milestone on our London visits."
April 2016,The Lap of Luxury,"Our first stay at the Milestone Hotel 4/4-9/2016 was one of pure delight. Upon arrival a quick check-in was followed by a tour of the public rooms - bar, dining room, library and the conservatory where we grabbed a quick bit to eat and then off to our room.   Our room had a king size bed, small seating area and a full modern bathroom with tub and an a wonderful shower. Excellent towels and bathrobe/slippers were there for your comfort. Twice daily maid/turn down service made sure the room was always in perfect shape.  We included breakfast in our room reservation which I recommend since breakfast at London hotels can be unreasonably priced by American standards. Having it included allowed us to choice between dining in the our room or in the dining room. We chose 'in room…"
April 2016,Fabulous Hotel,"This hotel is great, it is in a fantastic location with really friendly staff who go out of their way to help you, nothing is too much trouble. Rooms are fab with everything you need, make sure you ask for Tea and Coffe in your room. Toiletries, robes, slippers all in the room for you to use along with complimentary bottled water. We got this hotel on Secret Escapes so got a good deal for B and B, would visit again if offer came up. Breakfast was good with choice of cereals, fruit, meats, cheeses, yoghurts and hot cooked choices. Would recommend this hotel to all."
May 2016,Classic old school English,"Always a wonderful stay. Boutique hotel, attentive and solicitous service, wonderful food and a welcoming staff. Better every time. Can't say enough about this very special place. The library is a great place for an after dinner drink. The hotel is located across the street from Kensington Park and Kensington Palace.  Beautiful place for a stroll. London Whole Foods is a block away. How convenient!"
April 2016,Beautiful tranquil boutique hotel,"We spent an amazing weekend at The Milestone to celebrate a very special birthday with friends from US. We were welcomed by Patricio on arrival and made to feel welcome by all the staff. We had a beautiful room on the third floor overlooking Kensington Palace and gardens. Every possible need was met,crisp Egyptian cotton sheets and goose down pillows,the bathroom was well equipped with Penhaligan toiletries and lots of thick white towels. We had complimentary champagne and a delicious lunch.Breakfast was a really an amazing affair,so much choice I cannot begin to list,but it appeared that anything was possible. It really was a wonderful experience,I cannot recommend this beautiful hotel enough! If you want luxury this is the place to stay"
May 2016,SUPERB!,"This old building beautifully preserved and enhanced whilst offering all the trappings of a first class international hotel. Walk into a 'home from home atmosphere' to be met by the most professional,  pleasant & helpful staff you could ever wish to meet! Wonderful dining in plush surroundings and overlooking Kensington Gardens with a 'back drop' of Kensington Palace. My photos don't show fully the splendour of this hotel. Any of my clients that stay here always find it a faultless experience! "
May 2016,Excellent Hotel,We had a wonderful time and the concierge took excellent care of us. Across from Kensington palace and the sunshine followed us from Florida.  Highly recommend this hotel. Cool bar and the room was very British.
April 2016,Most elegant high tea in london,Wonderful tea selection Divine tea sandwiches Delicious pastries Top notch service Kind to children Go every visit to London and go several times a year Grandchild's Christening party held here Respectful and interesting staff from several nations but all with good English
April 2016,Feels like home,"I loved staying there above all for all personnel tried to make me feel like home. I got upgraded upon arrival to deluxe king, room was serviced twice a day, it was bright and very comfy and cosy. Bed was huge and very comfortable. Location is perfect since tube is like 150m away and Kensington gardens is just across the street. Lot of restaurants and shops are near by. Wifi works perfectly which was important for my business."
May 2016,Cosy and professional,"Very warm welcome after a long journey back to London. Professional staff, comfortable but rather cluttered room(king sized deluxe apparently)- but still comfortable. Good breakfast apart from quality of scrambled eggs...Altogether enjoyable."
April 2016,"Stylish Boutique Hotel, Wonderful Staff, Disappointing Food","My wife and I stayed in the Red Carnation group hotel in Dorset, and were so impressed that we booked a night in the Group's Milestone hotel for our next visit to London.  We loved the wonderful boutique style of the hotel, with its quality furnishings, and fabulous rooms. But we were overwhelmed by the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. We have never been treated so kindly and made to feel so important to the hotel, in any hotel that we have stayed at in our ( very long) lives to date. This included a tour of the hotel and its public rooms on arrival with an explanation of the hotel's history, We loved the style and comfort of our bedroom, which had everything that you could want. So why only a 4 out of 5 rating ? Simply because, the dining room and our dinner did not…"
May 2016,"Excellent design, friendliest service","My expectations were high based on reading reviews. The formality (staff in tails; elegance of property) suggested stuffiness, and yet the staff were so friendly and helpful and accessible/down to earth) that we felt relaxed and comfortable. They couldn't help us enough. Liam, who checked us in and out, and Leo at the front desk, were delightful and hospitable. Patricio the doorman was always there and very helpful. We wish we could remember everyone else's name. Everyone on staff went out of their way to be friendly, and it seemed sincere. They hire staff who are naturally ""people people""; they all seemed to get along well with each other, too. We also liked the small resistance pool and sauna, after a long day of walking in London. We stayed here during a conference across the…"
April 2016,Classic British Charm.," Our stay at The Milestone was absolutely wonderful.  We were given an apartment perfectly suited to our needs (few stairs as we were traveling with 91 year old Mother).  The staff could not have been more welcoming and attentive.  Thoughtful details abound.  Breakfasts were an elegant and delicious way to start the day.  Dinner in the dining room was superb.  We also enjoyed drinks and snacks in the Stables bar, and light meals were served as we sat by the fire in the living room. We also had a family reunion and amazing Tea service in the Oratory.  We made use of the Hotel's Range Rover, and enjoyed the great location across from Kensington Palace.  Overall, this was perhaps our best hotel experience, ever, and we have The Milestone's extraordinary staff to thank for that.  We…"
March 2016,Thoroughly enjoyed my stay,"Stayed in Apartment # 5 (two bedrooms, two baths, kitchen, living area, fireplace). They stocked the fridge with juice, bread, jam, bottled water.    We enjoyed our dinner at Chenestons (Milestone restaurant) and the Stables Bar is the best.  The staff are very high service.  Thanks to Fran, Leo, Liam, Fabrizio, Graham and many others for making our stay so comfortable."
March 2016,wonderful stay ruined by horrid experience,"When we arrived at the hotel our room was not ready, so we had to wait in the bar whilst it was cleaned and prepared. It was a minor inconvenience and we didn't mind at the time.although the hotel seemed perfect in every way whilst we stayed, it was not long after we left before we had the first telephone call leaving a message to say we needed to phone the hotel urgently. On doing so the member of staff said he was embarrassed to ask but did we find a Pandora bracelet in our room as a previous guest had left one , when I said of course not as we would have handed it it straight away he asked perhaps on the coffee table? I said definitely not and he apologized for asking.  I was a little upset that what had seemed ike a perfect stay was now marred by the thought that we might…"
March 2016,great hotel,"stayed here on buisness, great staff, great food, very clean.. will come back. the beds are real comfortable and free wi fi, was very quiet to no disturbance from other rooms and tehre are lots of places nearby."
March 2016,Wonderful one night stay,"My brief stay was delightful, a gorgeous room stocked with everything you could possibly need, attentive and charming staff, a delicious breakfast.  The Milestone is an oasis of calm and tranquillity in the heart of London.  Highly recommended!"
March 2016,Wonderful.  ,"Another wonderful time at the Milestone. A belated birthday treat for me from my Mum. We were joined by my youngest daughter and fiance. Both rooms were gorgeous. I had a welcome back card waiting for me, a lovely touch. The extra little treats, teabags (my favourite)  home-made biscuits and sweets make you feel special. On our return from the Royal Albert Hall there was a birthday card and yummy strawberries dipped in chocolate waiting for me.  My daughter felt guilty as she had left her room in a mess before we went out for the evening and on our return everything had been tidied.  The awesome staff are what really make your stay special,  always friendly, helpful and attentive.  I am looking forward to returning again in May. "
March 2016,An excellent mini-break,"We have just had a very enjoyable 2 night stay at The Milestone.  All was superb - from the deluxe double room, the home made cookies waiting for us, and the amazing French toast served for breakfast.  We dined in on one evening and were treated to a lovely meal.  Also a perfect location, close to the underground and a stones throw from Kensington Gardens - perfect for a leisurely stroll.  What stands out most though is the staff - so attentive and engaging, nothing was too much trouble - a breath of fresh air!  I am sure we will return.  Cathy R."
March 2016,"A Lovely Hotel, with very professional and attentive staff!!","Mr Andrew Pike the general manager has a good marketable product on offer with this hotel, backed up by a very well groomed and professional team of people! We stayed here at the Milestone over the weekend March 19th, we had booked our stay thro ugh secret escapes and when it came to check in we were luckily enough to have received a room upgrade to the royal suite, which was room 209 on the second floor, the room was traditionally  furnished with all the five star extra's that you would expect!! Including a comprehensive and well stocked mini bar, two sets of robes, one for the bathroom and another for general wear when in the room, complementary water, biscuits (home made by the chef!) and we also received a welcome and complementary bottle of Champagne, in fact this was a…"
March 2016,Very special birthday treat,"We cannot recommend this hotel enough for when you are looking for luxury, great service and amazing location. Fantastic attention to detail. Our car was whisked away on arrival to be parked without fuss. The champagne afternoon tea was an experience in itself, a real joy. Then we found we had been upgraded to a suite as our visit was celebrating a special birthday. Wow- utter luxury. When it was time to head off to the theatre for Mamma Mia, a taxi was hailed for us by the extremely helpful concierge team in seconds. We returned to a beautifully prepared room and hot chocolate. We slept very well in our four poster. A sumptuous breakfast was served in the morning with everything we wanted. I can highly recommend the eggs benedict. A magnificent hotel, the staff are all very…"
February 2016,Service - at its best,"Stayed here in Feb 2016 as a party of 4. We were going to the Royal Albert Hall to see Cirque De Soleil, and the location is spot on for that venue.  I cannot rate the level of service highly enough. Doorman greeted us like old friends, and arranged valet parking for our car, ideal in London.  Reception booking in was swift and welcoming. We were shown to our rooms and offered a tour of the hotel. Welcome card and gifts in our rooms. Our guests had the African room, and we were opposite in a lovely room too. Welcome drink served in you room or in the lounge as you preferred.  Breakfast was excellent. All in all, perfect hotel and location for a London break."
March 2016,A wonderful stay,"We are a middle aged couple visiting London for leisure. This hotel is perfectly situated for visiting the Royal Albert hall and museums.This was our first stay at the milestone but it certainly won't be our last. From the moment we arrived the staff were professional, attentive and sincere without being overpowering. The hotel felt warm and friendly, this is not a modern hotel, the decor is very traditional, lots of wooden paneling, mosaic floors, polished brass all to a very high standard. We had a superior room, enhanced by the attention to detail, fresh flowers, a small box of biscuits handmade by the chef, a handwritten note from the general manager to welcome us and at ""turn down "" time a candle by the bath and a card on the bedside giving the weather forecast for the…"
January 2016,Wow!,"Booked through Secret Escapes as a Christmas present for my wife. Probably the best hotel we have stayed in!  Paid a very good price through Secret Escapes, but this made absolutely no mark whatsoever on the level of service received.  As soon as we walked in the staff were attentive and very nice. At the reception desk, we were upgraded to a King room and all the details were dealt with efficiently and to an excellent standard. We were then given an optional tour of the hotel where we were given a brief history of the hotel and shown the various main rooms (restaurant, bar, etc) before being shown all the way to our room. The room was exceptional. The bottle of champagne on the side (part of the deal) along with a personal, handwritten, card (envelope and all) and a few little…"
February 2016,THE Boutique Hotel in London,"My partner booked an overnight stay for us as a treat, and what a treat it turned out to be! We had eaten at the restaurant last year before visiting the Albert Hall and been charmed by this quaint, boutique hotel, so we arrived with high expectations.  We were not disappointed in any respect. The service at the Milestone is second to none. From the moment we arrived, we felt thoroughly spoilt.  On arrival, we were offered a welcome tea or coffee, with homemade biscuits. Our beautifully appointed room had more biscuits, bottled water, fresh flowers,Penhaligons toilettries. Simply wonderful.  We had drinks in the bar before dinner. Again, with faultless service, a fine Port Ellen scotch, delicious canapés; we didn't want to leave.  But we did, as dinner beckoned. We had dinner…"
February 2016,Afternoon Tea,"Great service and a wonderfully cozy way to spend Valentine's Day with my family. We had a reservation for 5pm and arrived an hour late because of horrendous traffic. They graciously accommodated us anyway and we enjoyed our tea, delicious scones and sandwiches by the fire. "
August 2015,Best Unexpected Layover Ever!,"I had and unexpected layover in London with my husband and four kids last August en route back to the US from Italy. We were lucky enough to snag a couple of rooms at the Milestone through our American Express card.The hotel manager could not have been more kind and accommodating. We arrived harried and weary from 22 hours of delays, cancelled flights and rerouting. My kids were past the point of hungry and approaching anarchy. The manager sent complimentary food and drinks to their room and paid for our food and Guinness (desperately needed) at the pub. The rest of the staff and the hotel were truly superb! Our room was over the top hip,well appointed and comfortable. The beds were excellent. I don't often go to London but would book a trip there again just to stay at the…"
February 2016,Unashamed luxury,"We have stayed at other hotels in The Red Carnation Group around the world and our experience in all of them has been characterised by service excellence, attention to detail and unashamed luxury. The Milestone was no exception. The hotel adhered fully to the group's statement of ""Core Values"" which is on the Red Carnation website. A wonderful weekend stay! I have reviewed the Cheneston Restaurant separately."
February 2016,short break,"This is probably finest hotel we have ever stayed at, and the welcome we received on arrival was second to none. We were given a guided tour of all the amenities and shown to our room which was beautifully appointed with classic period furniture and a Super king size bed.  The hotel is situated on Kensington High St overlooking Kensington Palace and is ideal for exploring the park, The Albert Memorial and Royal Albert Hall. Our 3 course dinner, which was included in the price, was excellent and from the extensive menu. As we had let slip that it was our anniversary, when we returned to our room we found that not only had the bed been turned down, but the whole room had been decorated with rose petals, tea lights and chocolates. To say we were delighted would be a complete…"
February 2016,Brilliant!,"What amazing service, every single member of staff made us feel at home.  If you want a world class personal service the experience is worth every penny (if your paying for it!). Thank you to everyone including Andrew the general manager, you really do feel part of the family!"
February 2016,We just keep coming back!!,"I can't rate this hotel highly enough, everything about it from the second you arrive -is absolutely spot on! The staff are super friendly and nothing is too much trouble. The rooms are bright and airy , comfortable and there are loads of thoughtful extras that keep appearing during your stay! The bartender does a mean Bloody Mary too !! Highly recommend , you won't be disappointed!!"
February 2016,Fantastic stay in London ,"What a lovely stay in The Milestone hotel. Very friendly and welcoming staff! Great bar, restaurant and service. This time our stay was with our son of 8..... the hotel could not have been better for him and us! We will definitely stay there again!"
February 2016,Absolutely the best service we have ever experienced.,"This is the most incredible hotel we have ever stayed in, we will never consider another property in London again. The reason for this is the unbelievably attentive service from every single member of the team. From the second we arrived to the moment we left we were treated like royalty. Thank you so very much for the most wonderful night - we just wish it had been a longer visit but we will most certainly be back very soon."
February 2016,"So impressed with this lovely, exquisite, small, ""hidden gem of a Hotel"" !!","Located opposite Kensington Gardens/Kensington Palace.  We wanted somewhere within easy access of the Royal Albert Hall and special, since we were celebrating a 70th birthday with family and friends.  We were not disappointed.  Only 45 beautifully appointed rooms, decorated in totally individual styles and themes.  Public rooms all stunning, staff ., without exception, welcoming, courteous, pleasant, very helpful and nothing was too much trouble.  Restaurant/dining rooms fabulous and a great bar with super cocktails!! Very good breakfast and they are also open for afternoon tea.  We really cannot wait to stay there again.  We think that nowadays it's rare to find somewhere that is the real deal .. This one has it in spades!!!"
February 2016,Amazing hotel,"We booked through Secret Escapes and got a very good deal, but this in no way what so ever was reflected in the service we got, from the moment we entered everything was perfect. Someone rushed to open the taxi door for us, and help with bags. We let them know we were celebrating our anniversary and were upgraded to a Junior Suite, which was beautiful. There was a lovely outdoor terrace, if it was sunny that would have been lovely! Our rate included champagne in the room, which we chose to upgrade. There were delicious home made biscuits in the room, and we were offered a complimentary welcome drink, more champagne! The room was beautiful, every little touch was thought of (shame the ipod docking station was for the older iphone/ipods- but that is the only insignificant thing i…"
February 2016,Faultless stay,"Booked to stay in the milestone for one night and was upgraded to a Junior Suite. Room was immaculate. Staff were friendly, helpful and approachable. We both had a beauty treatment which I would wholly recommend. The resistance pool was more of a large sized jacuzzi but this does not affect my rating as it was still lovely to relax in there before using the hotels' sauna. The room service menu was very varied and fairly priced. In all I would highly recommend the Milestone. It's like stepping back in time and a gorgeous place to escape for a night or two. We'll definitely be back."
February 2016,Fab relaxed afternoon tea,"I visited for afternoon tea with some former work colleagues and was not disappointed.  The choice of sandwiches, pastries and teas was great and we made it an extra treat with a glass of bubbly.  One of our party has several food allergies so we'd asked for a vegan option which I thought was a bit of an ask for an afternoon tea menu but they went right of their way with specially baked bread and scones and some really imaginative and tasty alternatives to the cakes, pastries and fillings, it must have been all designed from scratch for this one person which was very impressive.  The service was second to none, attentive, friendly, informed and relaxed and the setting was lovely.  We were right in front of a roaring fire and the room was relaxed and comfortable and we did not…"
February 2016,Best hotel I have stayed at in London,Just back from this fantastic hotel.  Everything about it great and nothing is too much troulble.  All of the staff are amazing...so attentive.  The rooms are lovely and lots of little extras which make your stay feel special.  The food was excellent and served in beautiful surroundings.  We can't wait to go back.  Thanks for a great weekend
November 2015,Tea and tour..,"Although we were unable to stay at the Milestone this visit we have stayed at the sister Red Carnation property the Montague on the Gardens. I wanted to check out the Milestone and it is superb with the charming English decor we love to find in England and the special services this brand offers. Our visit was on a very rainy day and we arrived drenched but taken instantly in hand by the front staff. Coats and umbrellas dealt with we toured the bar and other public rooms, several suites and longer term apartments (very reasonable for London) then in for tea. I've had tea at the Ritz, the Shard and in Windsor near the castle. The Milestone served up all the best sandwiches, pastry and unique desserts. Scones are brought out hot and fresh. The  tea room is like something on Downton…"
February 2016,Best Afternoon Tea in London,"We went to the milestone for afternoon tea for my wife’s birthday accompanied by our 4 and 6 yr old boys.  We all had an amazing time .  The boys couldn’t believe it when they got their own cake stands with sandwiches, scones and cakes and we also had an absolutely sumptuous feast!  Highlights for the food were the hot scones and the chicken sandwiches.  Go with an appetite, we went for the 1pm tea and skipped lunch and we still couldn’t finish everything (I did try)!  The location right opposite Hyde park and about 5 minutes walk from the Princess Diana Memorial Playground make it an ideal location for a day out with kids. Lovely!"
February 2016,Absolute gem in Kensington,"A very comfortable & cosy hotel in leafy Kensington next to the park. We were greeted on arrival, showed to the room & offered a welcome drink. The welcome was most gracious thanks to the Front Office team from the Concierge to the Receptionist. The breakfast was lovely & we managed to walk around to explore the next day. A must visit again!!"
February 2016,Best service in London!,"We were in London last week and we decided to give the Milestone Hotel a try as we usually stay in another hotel in the Kensington area.  It was a great decision!  The hotel is extremely welcoming and helpful.  From the moment we were greeted at the door until checkout, we were pleased.  The staff couldn't have been more accommodating or pleasant.  The concierge was quick to find just what we required, even helping my husband to get flowers for me for Valentine's Day."
February 2016,I wish I could give 10 stars!!!,"The Milestone is absolutely fabulous!  I read many reviews of this hotel and then went to the hotel's website.  Then I was sold!  We stayed 5 nights and we were enchanted every day.  The staff was so accommodating and professional.  Our favorite time at the hotel was breakfast with the charming and ""quirky"" (that's an inside joke!) Devon, Immaculata, Magdalena and Jack.  They started our day off on the right foot.  Of course, we cannot fail to mention the Saddle Bar with Fabrizio II and Palido (spelling???).  Fabrizio Russo, the beverage and food manager, made sure we received the best service possible.  The concierges, Jose and Joshua, were so helpful in securing reservations for us at the most wonderful restaurants.  The location of the hotel is wonderful--just across the…"
March 2016,The Milestone does it again!,On a recent business trip to York England we discovered Adele was in concert in London during the stay.  My wife had deliberated about making the trip from York to London but was hesitate in traveling and staying alone in London.  I told her contact The Milestone as we have stayed there previously and had become our hotel of choice when traveling to London.  We contacted the hotel and Joshua and Andres were able to secure tickets for her and my sister who flew from the states just for the concert.  They felt safe traveling and once again the hotel staff were looking out for them.  The kitchen even sent up cupcakes with images of Adele on the top!  Once again kudos to Mr Pike and his staff for an excellent stay.  The truly is our home away from home when in London no question…
March 2016,5 stars all the way!,"We booked this hotel through a secret escapes offer and we hadn't heard of it until we booked. What a place! We stayed 2 nights when visiting the city to catch up with friends and do some  of site seeing.  As the weather was nice, we caught the tube to Gloucester Road and walked to the hotel. Only  10 minutes.   The area round the hotel has some lovely old buildings and right  near Hyde Park.   Walking up to the hotel you can tell it is going to be a great experience. We were greeted at the door and our cases were taken in for us. We were checked in, asked about our plans in London and taken on a mini tour of the hotel.  Our room was a superior King which was beautiful. A good size and nicely decorated. A chilled bottle of champagne awaited us alongside a welcome card and…"
March 2016,Luxury in Kensington,"Just a short walk from the Royal Albert Hall, across the road from Kensington Gardens, this hotel is not cheap. You get exactly what you pay for, a beautiful room in a luxurious setting. Many rooms are themed, and there is an indoor swimming pool. You can take a relaxing afternoon tea with sandwiches, scones and cakes, all freshly made by the hotel's chef.  Whether you stay for a night or your holiday, the service is excellent and you  can be certain you will not be disappointed. Many celebrities choose the hotel, and the lounges are comfortable to sit in on a rainy day and just enjoy the ambience."
March 2016,"Perfect service, great location, fabulous facilities.","We can't recommend this hotel enough, from the moment we entered the hotel we were treated with the most amazing customer service and it continued to the point we left. Nothing at this hotel has been left to chance, the rooms, facilities have been so well thought through to give customers the best experience possible.  The little touches mean a lot, when we returned from the Adele concert we were treated with Adele cupcakes!  This is now our hotel of choice when visiting London.  Absolutely world class!"
March 2016,I second (or third or fourth) everyone's comments,"I'm not going to say anything here that you haven't already read.  The hotel is clean, beautiful, centrally located, really ornate and comfortable, and elegant.  And the sweets they put out at night are unreal.  But I'd say it's the service that stood out the most for me.  They were some of the nicest people I have had the pleasure of meeting.    If I HAD to say one thing...the walls are slightly thinner than I expected and you could hear doors slam and hallway people.  Luckily, it's not a ""young"" hotel, so most of the people who stay there are families, there for business, or ""higher end"" so you're not going to get a bunch of drunk kids running around at night.   Worst thing was the slamming of doors.  Ask for a room at the end of the hallway to mitigate."
March 2016,Gorgeous quaint hotel,"Just had an excellent weekend stay at this marvellous quaint 5 star hotel The hotel is well positioned, minutes away from Kensington palace, Royal Albert Hall and Kensington High Street. All staff are friendly and helpful and keen to help and enhance your stay   Dinner in the hotel was great as was relaxing in the bar and lounge.   We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a king room which had lovely views across Kensington Park. The room itself was well equipped, quiet, clean and comfortable. Lots of nice little touches too.  The only minor point was that there are no tea & coffee making facilities in the room although we believe you can request a complimentary tray we didn't get round to asking for one.   Overall, our new favourite London hotel!"
March 2016,Beautiful hotel with excellent service,"Amazing hotel!!! The room is perfectly decorated, luxurious and clean! Very good airconditioning as well and curtains are fabulous. Perfect location! The bathrooms are very nice as well! The staff are very friendly and extremely helpful which is a huge plus to all travelers. The hotel is absolutely complete ✅✅✅✅ Their tea is to-die-for! Never had tea this good in my life!!!  Would give it a 5 star but some areas in the floor and ceiling creak abit. But its fine! "
March 2016,The Milestone Hotel Kensington,Superb hotel with impeccable service. The staff are very attentive and the hotel has a very warm and homely atmosphere. Superb central London location within a stones throw of Kensington Palace. Fantastic value for money.
March 2016,Exceeds expectations,"The best breakfast we have ever eaten, just about everything you can imagine is cheerfully offered, including honey and lemon for a sore throat.  The dinner was simply perfect but the most outstanding and unique thing is that everyone seems genuinely happy to be there, ""I have never worked anywhere like this before"" is a quote from a smiling member of staff. Bea Tollman, the owner, has much to teach the hotel industry."
February 2016,A Magnificant Hotel,"My husband and just returned from 3 nights at the Milestone Hotel in London. What a magnificant place! Our room was charming, immaculately maintained, and overlooked a beautiful Kensington courtyard. The staff were attentive, friendly and gracious. We loved the heart-healthy breakfast buffet, followed by a number of hot,  delicous, breakfast selections that were perfectly prepared. We worked out in the small but more than adequate exercise room, walked in the park, and ate dinner right down the street 2 out of the 3 nights of our stay.  The location, across from Kensington Palace and adjacent to embassy row could not be better, and though I never spotted William or Kate, I know I will never stay at any other hotel in London. We give this hotel a 5 star rating.  Teri Heyden,…"
January 2016,Wonderful hotel and welcome,"From the moment we arrived at the front door we were made to feel welcome and special at this delightful hotel which is both luxurious and full of character. Andrew and his team have thought of every detail (including, for my husband, a birthday cake and card!); it is those touches as well as the very high standards at The Milestone that make it such a wonderful place to stay.  Our stay was too short and we would love to return one day. JML and JML"
September 2015,1st Class,What a charming place to stay from the warm welcome at the entrance  and to all the staff in all departments  they really do make you feel special  rooms were spotlessly clean and tastefully furnished would sure use again.
January 2016,The previous reviews sum it all up,"Wanting a special hotel that would accommodate two relatively elderly people and a very pedantic 5 star traveler is always difficult. For trips to London, especially when wanting to visit the RAH, I have now found it. This is the standard that all other 5 star hotels in London should be striving for. A mixture of opulence, unobtrusive and subtly attentive service, every need catered for and a happy and relaxed environment. Together with the assumed immaculate cleanliness, calm atmosphere and superb rooms, this venue ticked all the boxes. My room service breakfast was prompt, warm and perfect (full English). I have written a separate review for the Restaurant where had our evening meal - excellent. If I wanted to be extra pedantic, the only moments when I felt a little extra…"
June 2015,Best boutique hotel,This hotel is a gem in a busy city. We stayed there for four nights with our teenage son.  We met a lot of interesting people who were guests including Jeff Bezos of Amazon!  Which my husband was thrilled about. The staff there are over the top amazing and caring.  The rooms are elegant and comfy.  We will stay here again as it is in a super location to Kensington palace.  
January 2016,Exceptional Service,We visited this hotel for dinner last week and was met with accommodating and friendly staff. We were running late and this was no problem for them which is rare in other London venues.  The meal was tremendous so huge compliments to the chef and in particular the cheesecake for dessert. The staff go above and beyond to ensure you are enjoying your experience and were attentive and conscientious with two staff Augustine and David deserving a special mention for their hospitality.   The atmosphere was warm and welcoming and the hotel design was beautifully decorated with attention to detail in all aspects.  We would recommend this luxurious hotel as it was such a memorable experience and in a great location too. Thank you for  a great evening.
January 2016,Fantastic!,"Me and my wife visited this hotel on the weekend to celebrate out anniversary.  From the moment we arrived, to the moment we checked out, we had a wonderful experience in this well deserved 5 star hotel.  The room was well equipped, immaculately clean and beautifully decorated, with a particular attention to every detail.  The butlers and staff were attentive, helpful and went out of their way to provide us with an enjoyable stay. In particular, I had the impression that the staff very much enjoy their job and actually DO want to assist, unlike other places we have visited.  Nothing was too much trouble for them and they really did care about our experience and comfort.  I would imagine that this hotel has a Michelin starred chef as the breakfasts were amazing, and the food…"
January 2016,Excellent service,This is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed. Clean and classic. I stayed in the Kensington Garden Suite which is a split level suite through large floor-to-ceiling by window full of an air of romance and femininity.  All the service are comfortably provided. Make me feel like home.   I'm looking forward to go back.
December 2015,Fabulous,"My wife and I recently had a wonderful stay, and the hotel far exceeded my expectations. From the first minute to the last the staff was courteous, friendly, and efficient; the result was to make my wife and I feel special. Our overall experience is the stimulus for annual visits to London and repeat stays at The Milestone. Fabulous!"
March 2015,Dream hotel,ultimate in service and thoughtfulness.  Having spent almost 30 years travelling extensively for business this is my favourite in terms of things a top hotel can control - service.  Understated style and character are the perfect backdrop to deepthinking meetings.
December 2015,lovely,"very attentive staff, a lovely hotel, a great shame there isn't a no phone rule during breakfast, but could not fault the staff or the hotel. our Christmas stay for  olympia horse show was very special, however we would have also loved to have hired the Bentley to collect us alas I think that would have been enjoying ourselves too much!"
January 2016,Very welcoming staff,"My husband and I have spent three wonderful nights at the Milestone hotel we were offered an upgrade to a King suite (Savile Row room) .  This was our first stay at the Milestone and the staff made us feel very welcome and they were very helpful throughout our stay.  The room was stunning with wonderful views over Hyde Park, made all the more pleasurable with the bottle of chilled Moet champagne.  My husband who is a very light sleeper was disturbed by noise during the night,, again the staff could not have been more accommodating and helpful.    It was my birthday the next day and we went out for the day, on our return I found in our room a lovely Birthday card and wonderful Birthday cake from the Milestone and the offer of another upgrade to a Junior suite which we took them…"
December 2015,"Great Staff, Great Location",We stayed for a week between Christmas and New Years 2015 at the Milestone Hotel and we were so happy that we did.  The staff could not have been more accommodating and the facility is beautiful.  The hotel is perfectly situated directly across the street from Kensington Garden and an easy walk from the tube and shops.  The greatest asset that the Milestone has is it's staff.  Everyone there was so pleasant and helpful to our family.  There was no request that we made that they did not quickly and efficiently accommodate.  If you get the chance to book a room there do not hesitate.
January 2016,Brilliant Holiday,"We stayed for a week over New Years at Milestone Hotel, one of the Red Carnation Boutique Hotels, located across from Kensington Palace. Wow! The British hospitality and personal service was impeccable. The proper staff was superlative in ensuring we were enjoying our visit on many levels throughout our stay. A highlight experience was the Afternoon Tea at Milestone, positively regal!   The concierge's recommendations were fantastic; especially resturants and the  ""Big Bus Tour"". The staff on the tour were extremely gracious, informative, and entertaining.   In closing I want to thank the doorman, butler, front desk, waitstaff and the concierges for a positively ethereal experience. It's evident that the management have a corporate culture with the highest level of service!"
January 2016,Bliss,"Just had a night at the Milestone and what a wonderful short experience it was, lucky to start with as we were offered an upgrade which was very welcomed. Apart from being beautifully decorated and furnished what makes this hotel outstanding are the staff. It seems red carnation are a good company to work for and it comes across with the cheerful and exceptionally efficient workforce who do everything to make your stay memorable. One of the best hotels I've been to and I can't sing there praises high enough."
December 2015,Wonderful surprise,"We stayed recently and we could not be made more welcome or treated any better. All hotels should be like this , we could of stayed in the Royal Kensington which is a stones throw away from this hotel but chose the Milestone out of curiosity and  we were not dissapointed. Sadly we could only stay one night, I would gladly move in permantly.we had a cocktail in the bar in the evening served by two excellent bar staff in white tuxedos and bow ties , definitley from a different era. The breakfast next morning was superb with freshly squeezed fruit juices, not from a carton. Already planning my next stay. Thanks to all the staff at the Miestone."
December 2015,Delightfully British Hotel,"From the very first minute we felt at home...the parlor as familiar as my own living room. The dining room served delicious food, and afternoon tea was wonderful. Service of the highest standards and very friendly staff who will do anything to make your stay enjoyable. The hotel is impeccably clean and cozy, albeit the rooms are fairly small. It has become our hotel of choice when visiting London."
December 2015,Wonderful boutique hotel,"I stayed at this lovely hotel for five days at the beginning of December with my six year old son . I frequently travel to London and have stayed in various five star hotels over the years but this was my first stay at the Milestone . I was looking for a child friendly hotel close to Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park and saw the wonderful reviews on trip-advisor and decided to book. I am so happy I did , the hotel lives up to all the praise it receives from reviewers.  I really cannot find fault with anything. We were upgraded upon arrival to a beautiful suite. There were so many little touches that made it so special, champagne for me on arrival and sweets for my son , complimentary canapés delivered to our suite, a different sweet surprise on our bed every evening as part of…"
November 2015,Getting better all the time and exceeded my expectations again,"We stay here regularly, and truly once I walk through the door I breathe easier and relax, it feels like home. This time after a rather hectic period all the right notes to celebrate so many wonderful things were delivered beyond expectations. All the staff, in particular Devon at breakfast, Jose who secured tickets to the sold out shows, everyone was amazing. So friendly. But wait there's more! Don't miss out on having a facial with Fiona, she is amazing and how she manages to deliver such an amazing experience in such a small space beggars belief. If we could have managed to get my hair sorted life would've have been perfect."
December 2015,5* Afternoon Tea,"I have just returned from the Milestone Hotel for my daughter's 12th birthday celebration with 4 of her friends. We were overwhelmed with the visit. The girls experienced many Wow moments, from their own pot of hot chocolate and their very own cake stand full of delightful sandwiches and delectable pastries (nothing too fancy for their taste). We were booked into the conservatory, because at the time of booking, it was available. We were aware that we would share this room with others, but on the day, had it to ourselves. The children had the Little Princess tea and this was plenty for their appetites; an adult tea would be far too much for them.  The staff are incredibly professional, but far more importantly, they have a warmth and thoughtfulness I have not seen at other…"
November 2015,"As near to perfect ""British"" you will find . ","If you are a visitor to London and want a perfect 5 star British experience then look no further than this lovely hotel . I have lived in London and worked here in the past and wasn't aware of this stunning hotel until I booked through the Leading Hotels of the World. Every member of staff is so well trained and professional that you know you are in a superbly run establishment. It is situated opposite Kensington Gardens which is perfect for a walk if you enjoy doing so and easy access to everything that London has to offer . The bar area is unique and quirky, the prices are normal for London but you get the most fantastic canapés. We had a lovely breakfast in another quirky area but very nice . It is easy to see why this hotel is so highly rated ."
September 2015,Snug comfort,"We did enjoy our stay at the lovely Milestone Hotel.   However, with no drawer  space and a tiny closet in our Deluxe Twin room, we found our requested AmEx upgrade unavailable, so we lived out of our suitcases for 10 nights in snug quarters.  The room, which faced the Kensington Gardens, was sound proof with absolutely effective blackout curtains.  The bed was firm and comfortable, and we appreciated the bottled water each night.  The bathroom had just enough space for his & her toiletries with a magnifying mirror and large, fluffy towels. The staff, without exception, is first rate and the public areas are charming.  One could not ask for more fresh and delicious breakfast choices in the small attractive restaurant and the coffee was great!   We did dine several evenings in…"
September 2015,Fantastic hotel in London,"My wife and I stayed here recently and very much enjoyed it. The staff were all very helpful and welcoming, we instantly felt at home when we arrived. Two nights after we arrived it was our anniversary, so I had emailed the concierge the week before to ask if he could book a table for us at a very desirable restaurant, which he did, and he got back to me straight away. Our room was very comfortable and quiet, and I especially enjoyed how they put some nice romantic music on for us every night during the turndown service. Breakfast every morning was very nice, and my wife had a treatment at the spa which she talked about for days after. The location was also excellent, just down the road from Kensington High Street Underground and across the road from Hyde Park. We have only been…"
October 2015,"Lovely, effortless luxury if one gets over the sticker shock","I had a lovely two-night stay at the Milestone Hotel in October, 2015. The overall impression was of apparently effortless luxury supported by a strong customer focus. The hotel gets the big and the little things right. The big: pleasant appearance, quiet rooms, a cozy interior feel, a superb location. Excellent wifi on all devices (no limits!). A comfortable bed made with high-end linens. Impeccably clean bathrooms stuffed with amenities – extra towels, extra shampoo and conditioner, drinking glasses galore – all items that have been shrunk or eliminated in even higher-end chain hotels. The little: toffees and other small welcome gifts placed by the bed at night. Free shoe shine. (Images are attached of the multiple electrical outlets and the laundry and shoe shine center in…"
September 2015,"Quintessentially British: charming, elegant and gracious","My opinion is a bit influenced by the room upgrade. That said, the physical facility is English at its most beautiful. It faces Kensington Gardens in Hyde Park. The food in the restaurant is superb, and we had several chances to judge that. Breakfast is fabulous. The staff is as gracious as they could be. Jose, the head concierge, was particularly helpful in securing a piano to rent. I suppose there are other wonderful boutique choices in London, but I have no need to experiment further."
September 2015,Nothing's changed except it has continued to be exceptional!,"Arrived "" home"" yesterday at the Milestone hotel. Had not been there in a little while but received such warm greetings from everyone with which we initially had contact. Maybe they remembered us and maybe they did not but it did not seem to matter in terms of how well they took care of us. The management and team at this hotel truly understand what it means to take exceptional care of their guests. We simply always love coming home to the Milestone. Hard to imagine that there is any other hotel in London that is better than the Milestone."
September 2015,Terrific Boutique hotel,"We recently stayed at the Milestone for three days while visiting London- While not the ideal location to see the main sites in the center of the city the Tube was only a 15 minute walk and very easy to get around. The hotel itself, while expensive, was worth it. The staff was gracious and helpful. We arrived late last Thursday and they served us dinner in the sitting room as the dining room was full and the  bar lounge was busy as well. Bedroom was very attractive. Only small complaint was the elevator recorded message regarding the floor as the door opened- not necessary and distracts from the quiet, and high class, ambiance of The Milestone.  Jack"
June 2015,Amazing hotel!,"What a surprising treat.  My children (5 and 9 years old) and I stayed at the Milestone during our first visit to London this summer. It was recommended by American Express and although I'd lived in London a while back, I'd never heard of it. I've been raving about it ever since! Everything was beyond perfection. We arrived early and they offered us a temporary room until ours was ready. We napped, showered, and were ready for an afternoon of exploring. Our permanent room was beautiful & luxurious - they even included robes & slippers for the kids. Restaurant recommendations were spectacular, with special care for our food allergies. The doorman gave us bread to feed the birds in Kensington Gardens one day. Afternoon tea was an experience not to be missed. Breakfast was…"
September 2015,Not quite as good second and third time around,"We stayed at this Hotel back in 2011. We were delighted with the Milestone back in 2011 and without hesitation thought we would stay here again on this trip to the UK. We stayed here in August and September so this review covers both visits. A number of issues occurred during our stay that singularly may not have amounted too much but annoyances kept occurring. On check-in , the porter arrived with the baggage and the birthday cake - my partners birthday was two days later. When I told the porter that it wasn't the birthday, he still persisted I should accept the cake and begrudgingly walked away mumbling perhaps we can freeze it. I noted on our itinerary the the travel agent had noted the correct date of my partners' birthday, I noted that a box of tea had been left as a gift…"
September 2015,Fabulous Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for three nights in September, 2015.  From the moment we arrived by car to leaving for the airport to come home, we has FABULOUS service.  The check in desk had our reservation ready with the most professional gentlemen welcoming you to the hotel by name.  We were shown to our room quickly with the luggage arriving almost before we got to the room.  We ate dinner in the lovely hotel restaurant the first night and had breakfast every morning and all meals were excellent, with the same terrific service.  We had a small problem with a cell phone and the concierge was most helpful in solving the problem.  Everyone from the doorman to service personnel were helpful, cheery and very professional.  I would highly recommend this hotel for any London visitor who…"
June 2015,miestone to the albert hall,we have stopped at the milestone at Christmas and when we visit the royal albert hall such as Christmas sing alongs and seeing don mclain it is so convinent to get to and fro it has wonderful facilities & great staff & food
November 2015,Third time staying here and it just keeps getting better,"We've chosen the Milestone for a two night stay in London three years running now and I'm still struggling to find the right words to describe how good it is. I can't find a single thing about the place that isn't absolute perfection - it's the best hotel experience imaginable. I've stayed in other luxury hotels around London - including the Savoy among others, but they can't come close to the experience of the Milestone. The obsessive attention to detail with everything and the unbelievable level of service. Every member of staff will bend over backwards to make you feel welcome and to help out with anything. For me, it's their level of service that sets the Milestone above all the others - I've not experienced such high quality customer service anywhere else, from any other…"
October 2015,Amazing Experience,"Not very often does a hotel experience far, far exceed expectations, but the Milestone is one lovely hotel which does.  It is a lovely grand lady with wonderful amenities.  Very unique and special; a total home-like feeling.  Each area of the down stairs is special and different.  The breakfast are is charming and the food fabulous.  The tea was lovely; the best I have had in London and that includes The Ritz.  Took my daughter there for her first tea experience and she was so excited and felt to special..Service was terrific and everything about the Milestone is grand scale on an intimate level.  Not to be missed!!!"
November 2015,Another fabulous time. ,"I stayed at the Milestone again this weekend. I was with my Mum, brother and sister-in-law. We were upgraded to an apartment. What a great start to the weekend ! We arrived early (09.30) and so was pleasantly  surprised to find the apartment ready for us. The flowers we ordered for my Mum (birthday treat) were already waiting for her.  Everyone is always so cheerful, polite and nothing is too much trouble.  Another 2 members of the family popped in for breakfast on Sunday and we all enjoyed wide variety of hot and cold food.  We have already booked another visit for March 2016.  Lovely people and a lovely hotel. 😃  "
September 2015,Fantastic ,It was an absolute pleasure to stay at this hotel. Luxurious rooms with everything you could possibly want or need is at hand or a phone call away. Beautifully soft beds and lovely linen which was fresh and clean. The whole room was spotless. Delightful staff who will go out of their way to accomodate you. Will definitely return. 
November 2015,Fabulous Hotel !,"We recently had the pleasure to stay at this gem of a hotel and thoroughly enjoyed our stay on our first trip to London.  First off, I have never experienced such an attentive staff before in a hotel as I did at the Milestone.  From check-in, to the bartender and restaurant staff, the concierge, housekeeping…everyone was so pleasant and eager to make our stay a pleasant one.  The quality and design of the hotel common areas and our room were a delight, with small added touches that I have not experienced at other luxury hotels that I have stayed at.  The staff made room for us at their afternoon tea one afternoon on short notice, and it was both charming and delicious, and something you should definitely consider if you staying at this hotel.  It was just a wonderful hotel…"
November 2015,Best Hotel with 5 star true British touch,"Excellent location , superb room service and great cozy traditional British rooms with finest room amenities. Rooms are very clean with  nice furnishings . Value for money and great feeling when you stay here. Break fast is good too expensive . High tea you need to book in advance , presentation at high tea is superb . TOO expensive. But good experience to have one while you are at this property. All staff are very professionally trained and very good knowledge of the London and surroundings . Check in front desk staff are dressed nicely but not that friendly when you check in you see they still lack to offer  the 5 star reception to the guests compare to other 5 star facilities . If you are booking this hotel pl have them included your breakfast . Not too many variety for…"
September 2015,Stayed for second time in September coming back this week  !,"My husband stayed for second time in September on a trip to visit Universities with my son. He stayed in the Safari Suite, (last time stayed in the apartments) , breakfast was excellent as before..and room was lovely ,. As he is going back this week will be interesting to see if everything remains excellent . I note that some reviewers have mentioned being upgraded on arrival , this has never happened to us even though we are returning customers which is a bit disappointing, will update this review after his stay, will be a great test of consistency! I expect they will continue to impress!!"
November 2015,Amazing experience,"My partner and I recently got engaged and booked a stay with this hotel to celebrate. The hotel staff were amazing and so helpful! In the evening we came back and our room (which was already beautiful) had been decorated in rose petals, candles, chocolates and strawberries. It was a lovely surprise and really made the trip special. Generally, the hotel is gorgeous. There is a resistance pool and sauna in the basement which, whilst small, was not very busy so it was nice to have it to ourselves. Oh, the complimentary hot chocolate is also a very yummy perk! We also ordered off the 24 hour room service and the food was still lovely. Generally, we are very grateful to the hotel for such a lovely stay."
November 2015,Wow!! Simply wonderful,"This Hotel is wonderful. The service, the rooms and all the special touches make this a wonderful hotel for anyone. We arrived with our nine years old son who absolutely loved it. The staff were so friendly, especially Georgia, they went out of their way to ensure that every request was catered for. The concierge took time to explain and book the attractions for us, we really didn't have to do anything ourselves. The hotel itself is fit for a King, just beautiful and the rooms are gorgeous. The breakfast was delicious and the afternoon tea, probably the best in London. Thanks you to all the staff who made this visit to London exceptional. We will definitely be back after Christmas, Thanks You."
November 2015,"Superb lunch, extraordinary service",Went to the Milestone for a celebratory lunch and was very impressed. Decor is excellent albeit that the first floor resembles a rabbit warren but the small dining room we used was warm and comfortable - perfect for our group.   I am always wary of mass catering but the food was first class and well presented.   Most impressive though was the service. There appeared to be more staff than guests all of whom were only too anxious to meet every need. All of them knew how to strike the perfect balance of friendliness and a pleasant chat if appropriate versus decorum and politeness.   I didn't stay at the hotel but on the impressions from lunch have no reason to doubt that this would be a luxurious experience. 
September 2015,What a fantastic Hotel,"What a great hotel in London will definitely be returning when next in the UK.  The service here is excellent, without exception every member of staff I encountered was first class.   In a city where most hotel visits your left disappointed feeling you've overpaid for something mediocre the Milestone really stands out.   Room was a good size, well equipped and very comfortable bed."
September 2015,What a wonderful hotel!!,"Top notch service, the best of the best!!! From check in to check out- not one issue!!!  We have wonderful memories of the lounge, restaurant etc., that we will fondly remember for always. The staff is incredible, they really go out of their way to please!! A true 5 star hotel. What a pleasure. Close to the Underground,,buses and across fro Kensington Palace. Great location."
September 2015,Could Hardly Wait to Return,"We visited London's Milestone Hotel a couple of years ago and gave it top ratings.  So much so, we could not wait to return which we did earlier this week for 3 fantastic days and nights.  I don't know how they could have exceeded our expectations, but Andrew Pike (GM) And his team did it again.  From our greeting with Patricio at the front door to Joshua and the other great concierges to the entire staff.  Our dinner was highlighted by Augustino and breakfasts by Food and Beverage manager Fabrizio.  We are already planning our next visit!  Thanks to the entire staff for making my birthday so memorable."
September 2015,Another Great Stay,"This is the third time we have stayed at the Milestone.  Our stay was delightful starting from the moment we arrived and were welcomed by the warm and efficient staff.  Our early morning flight meant that we arrived tired and hungry.  By the time we had had a delicious breakfast in the hotel dining room our very comfortable two level suite (an Upgrade!) was ready.  We like the location of this hotel.  It is within easy walking distance of the tube and there is an ATM on the way. It is well situated to visit the south Kensington museums.  The hotel itself is very lovely and each room is different.  But it is the staff who make The Milestone a hidden gem.  The concierge, the front desk, the doormen, the dining room - everyone was friendly, helpful and efficient.  We hope to return…"
September 2015,Charming doesn't even begin to describe the Milestone.,We didn't stay at the Milestone but spent an afternoon enjoying the Gentlemen's Tea.  It was a delightful experience and the Hotel couldn't be more charming if it tried. The interiors are exacting what you would picture the nicest English Manor house to look like and we were enchanted with every detail.   In a word the Gentlemen's Tea was perfection. 
August 2015,Wonderful Stay,"Excellent location (close to Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, Royal Albrt Hall, shopping, and underground station..). Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Lovely furniture. Romantic.  No tea and coffee making facilities in the room"
July 2015,Perfect hotel experience,"We stayed at the Milestone in early July for one week. We had two rooms, one a junior suite and were impressed and delighted by all that we experienced.Though Wimbleton was in full swing and the hotel completely booked, you never had the sense that it was crowded. We were seated promptly for a delicious breakfast daily with the surprise that a la carte choices were included in the price of the buffet. We often had afternoon cream teas in the Conservatory which were a wonderful way to unwind after a day of sightseeing. We ended each evening with a nightcap in the charming little bar. Every staff member we encountered provided nothing short of excellent service. Bellmen, servers, front desk, housekeeping were all professional and dedicated to their craft. The Concierge desk was…"
September 2015,Superb Stay,"We booked our room at the Milestone Hotel through Costco travel and it was one of the best picks ever.  The hotel service was excellent and our concierge, Andrea, was extremely helpful.  He helped us confirm our Golden Tours reservation and ensure that we knew where to go to catch the hop-on bus.  During our check in, one of the staff, Nick, give us a tour of the hotel. It truly is a beautiful property with lots of history.    The food was excellent.  Through our Costco package, each day we got the full breakfast, which also included the continental breakfast items (see pictures).  Everything I ordered was delicious (i.e. waffle, french toast, and souffle pancakes).  We also had dinner at the hotel and that was also really good.    When we return to London, we will definitely…"
September 2015,Outstanding stay in a magnificent hotel.,"This is a wonderful hotel with high standards. The service was exceptional, the whole hotel is extremely well looked after and the deluxe studio room was a total delight. If I must mention the slight problems they are: the sockets for plugs are few and hard to find, usually behind furniture which cannot be moved, making it difficult to use the kettle and the hairdryer; the breakfast is good but not exceptional given the high quality of the rest of the hotel, for instance there was no honey available; the lounge and bar are extremely pleasant but small and so soon crowded. If you can put up with these minor issues then there is nothing else to worry about! They look after you superbly and although this is an expensive hotel it is clearly one of the top hotels in London. If you…"
September 2015,A perfect hotel for a truly English experience ,"This is a great hotel across the street from Kensington park. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  Every room is different with great attention to detail. The hotel has an old style English decor, which makes it even more special.  Breakfast was delicious and the dining room very cozy. There is also a unique little bar downstairs which is cozy and a perfect place to end the day. "
August 2015,Magnificent Milestone makes me merry,"Warm, embracing staff and hotel with excellent location, great food, and more smiles than you expect in London. Don't miss the chance to smile back!    Rooms are beautifully appointed, bathroom amenities of the highest quality (Penhaligon was always my favorite) and lovely restaurant with fairly priced food and wine. Uber cool bar with enclosed gazebo feel for before or after!  Could be the Nike hotel:  just do it.   Great spot for Proms a few blocks away. "
August 2015,A Five-Carat Gem,"With tentative expectations for The Milestone, we were absolutely blown away by the boutique oasis.  The attention to detail given by every single member of the Milestone's staff never ceased.  The moment we were delivered by our driver, I knew that this was going to be special.  As the doorman greeted me, he requested my name and he never failed to use our name when addressing us.  We were greeted by reception and quickly escorted to our beautifully appointed guest room suite.  Every single detail was considered for our junior suite.  We were even provided with business cards that included our name.  To add to our wonderful experience, the hotel has an amazing restaurant and parlor for proper English tea.  The restaurant, Cheneston's, has a wonderful menu, outstanding food…"
August 2015,4 days at the Milestone,"An excellent hotel with all the amenities with a great location across the street from Kensington Park and Palace.  Also, close to the tube making it easy to get around. The room at the hotel was good sized and very clean.  Every day we found little gifts like tea and candy.  We had breakfast included with our stay and we were able to either have room service or go to the dining room.  The entire staff at the hotel seemed to try to go out of their way to be helpful, but we really want to thank the concierges Andrea and Jose who we're always very helpful and had great personalities.  We would like to go back to London and we would definitely stay at the Milestone."
July 2015,The Best of Kensington,"After spending two weeks traveling through England, Wales, Spain and Belgium, we decided to add three days in London. A friend recently stayed at the Milestone and gave it high marks, so we decided to walk in and see if there were any available rooms. We were greeted at the reception by a very helpful young woman who did an excellent job fitting us with the right room. After collecting our baggage, we were given a nice tour of the property ending in our room. I wont say the room number...but we think we got the best room in the hotel. Without too much detail, this hotel could do no wrong. The service: exceptional, the room: better than being at home, the food: some of the best we ate on the whole trip (they even were able to have menus specific for my wife's allergies). From the…"
July 2015,excellent,"This is a great location so walking was was a good option to several areas.  The staff goes above and beyond to make the guests feel like family.    The staff handled everything with sincerity and professionalism.  The restaurants are amazing, food is exceptional and the decor so inviting. The room where afternoon tea was served was attractive and comfortable, the food was more than sufficient in quantity, was wide in variety, and was very good in quality, the tea remained at the right temperature, and the service was excellent. The rooms are comfortable and each one is uniquely decorated in styles that make you want to visit all of them. I highly recommend over nighting at The Milestone Hotel."
May 2015,PLEASURE ISLAND,"I found this hotel purely by chance some years ago when attending an event at the Royal Albert Hall and having suffered grievously from the dire accommodation and non-existent service of an hotel much closer to the venue.  I have never looked back and stay at this place for both business and pleasure trips to London.  The staff are excellent, without exception, the bar is quirky and comfortable, the rooms are havens of respite and the food very good (the menu being underpinned by some long standing favourites of the founder)."
April 2015,fantastic,"The reason I pick Milestone because it is great old hotel. I was there for 3 night and couldn't have gone better. The room was so good and comfy, the staffs were very helpful 24/7. Me and my mom particular like the bar and the cocktails there were amazing. I will stay here again when i back"
June 2015,Service second to none.,This was our first time in London and our stay at the Milestone could not have gone better. The staff were so cordial and accommodating from our arrival and throughout our stay. We particularly enjoyed our room and hight tea. We also were served very well in their bar. We would highly recommend this hotel and staff. We will stay there again when we return.
July 2015,wonderful,"The hotel is a grand old building, but very well maintained and absolutely spotlessly clean.The reception desk staff were so polite, helpful and interested in where we were from and our reasons for the stay etc.  Offering different services including help with restaurant choicesAll in all it was a superb experience.The room where afternoon tea was served was attractive and comfortable, the food was more than sufficient in quantity, was wide in variety,  and was very good in quality, the tea remained at the right temperature, and the service was excellent.  Everyone was extremely friendly, courteous and went above and beyond on attention to detail.  After a quick and very personal check in we were led to our lovely room, the lady that scorted us went into full detail explaining…"
August 2015,Closer to a three star than the third best hotel in London ...,"I am a big fan and devotee of Trip Advisor (I never book without consulting it) and am shocked that this hotel is rated third in London for five star accommodations. Hotel location is great and the staff couldn't be nicer BUT our suite was incredibly cramped and felt tired and dingy.    In some ways, this feels more like a B&B than a grand hotel.  We had booked interconnecting rooms as we were traveling with our kids but got ""upgraded"" to an apartment. Clean enough rooms with renovated bathrooms. The master bathroom was so small the door had to be completely open to slide in.  There was barely room to make it around the bed and not enough space for our very minimal luggage.  In part, we choose this hotel based on the amenities of a pool and fitness center - both big…"
July 2015,Epitome of Elegance,"From the moment you enter you know you are in a very special place. All service is extremely polished and warm. They have a very international staff. You really do feel like you're in someone's elegant townhouse---which this once was. Two townhouses actually. We must thank our travel expert who is affiliated with Virtuoso because we received additional amenities, a very nice room upgrade and chauffeur service to our final destination in London. This hotel and it's staff provided a serene retreat from the noisy crowded bustle of London. Would highly recommend it without exception."
July 2015,"Gentlemen's afternoon tea at The Milestone Hotel, London","A family tradition and indulgence is afternoon tea at four or five star hotels. My wife and I, with various family members, have had very good experiences around the world. However, the Gentlemen's afternoon tea at The Milestone Hotel in London was the best I have had in a long time. The room where afternoon tea was served was attractive and comfortable, the food was more than sufficient in quantity, was wide in variety, and was very good in quality, the tea remained at the right temperature, and the service was excellent. All in all it was a superb experience. Thank you to David who served us, and to my daughter Rhiannon for taking me and her mother."
June 2015,3 Wonderful Days at The Milestone Hotel,"Everything was GREAT from Check In through Check Out. Everyone was extremely friendly, courteous and went above and beyond on attention to detail. After a quick and very personal check in we were led to our lovely room, the lady that scorted us went into full detail explaining all the room amenities. Everyday we had some sort of delicacy from the hotel chef to enjoy at evenings. Every morning our breakfast was beyond formidable, both a la carte, or buffet, waiters at the restaurant were always marvelous and extremely attentive. Hotel surroundings are beautiful, across the street from Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. I can't really find or say anything below wonderful! We wish could spent some more time in this wonderful city and this wonderful hotel."
July 2015,"Gerald Negvesky, MD","The Milestone is an absolute London Gem!  A close sophisticated friend who frequents London from the U.S. recommended it to us.  My family of 5 spent 9 nights in July....Simply Spectacular!  Accommodations are elegant, location is prime( best in London), staff is attentive and graceful.  The culture of the Milestone is that of pure excellence in hospitality.  Entire staff was wonderful, however, Jose and Andrea in concierge and Grant in dining, were among the best in service that we have ever experienced.  The Milestone made each of us feel like Royalty.  We are already planning our return trip next Summer."
July 2015,Lovely in London but something just off,"Please, I don't consider this four star rating a negative at all.  It is a lovely old hotel in Kensington adjacent to the Kensington Palace and Hyde Park, a great, relatively quiet, convenient location in London.  The rooms are nice and excellently appointed in the old city style.  The restaurant was small, but stylish and had excellent service.  The bar was a beautiful, wood paneled and brass railed room with a horse racing theme.  An excellent place to decompress and relax after a day in London.  Where the Milestone really excelled was the service throughout.  Special kudos to Benny at the front desk, Andrea the concierge, Fabrizio, the restaurant manager, and Emmanuel the sommelier.  That being said, after having stayed at other Red Carnation properties, something here just…"
July 2015,Lovely Afternoon Tea at the Milestone Hotel,"We recently had the pleasure of enjoying afternoon tea at the Milestone Hotel in London. We thought it would be an enjoyable experience, but it far exceeded our expectations. The Park Lounge was a lovely setting, and the service was amazing from start to finish.   Once we were seated, our server asked what kinds of teas we liked, made recommendations, and poured our tea. It was delicious! In fact, our 19 year old son declared that it was the best tea that he’d ever tasted and the staff was kind enough to send him off with some to enjoy at home.  Our sandwiches and desserts were next, and they were superb! The presentation was spectacular, and we ate far more than we should have. After having had our fill of finger sandwiches, meringue lollipops, cupcakes with  wonderful passion…"
June 2015,Loved Everything,"We stayed 6 nights in June at the Milestone Apartments (apt#1) We are a family of 4 with kids 7 and 11.  We LOVED the Milestone.  Everyone was very nice but still professional  (especially Steven at the door).    The apartment was super roomy and cozy.  It had 2 bedrooms, 2 1/5 baths, lovely sitting room, and a very functional kitchen.  We didn't eat at the apartment as much as I thought we would...but it was nice to have.  We used the washer and dryer every day.      The location was perfect with two parks with great playgrounds nearby, lots of dining options, and a tube station a few minutes away.  The M&S food hall was a good spot for some prepared foods.      Our room rate came with breakfast and it was delicious every day.  It was funny how they interpreted chocolate chip…"
August 2014,"Nice,but not again","Stayed last summer with family. The hotel is very conveniently located, but is small and dated IMO. The service was excellent overall, we did receive a call one night from a woman at the front desk telling us of a complaint of noise from some other guests. I explained there was no one in our room and I had just come down the hall and heard the phone, she was rude and told me to keep it down anyway.  Lots of American tourists here, thanks to Trip Advisor and other lists. The excellent reviews on TA swayed us to try this hotel, but I would likely not choose it again without it having some major renovation."
June 2015,Perfect London Hotel,"I have stayed in London on two other occasions vacationing. The Milestone was by far the best. A beautiful property.  So refined!  The staff always went ""the extra mile"" to accommodate  us. The doorman was always cheerful. The concierge staff  helped us with travel plans. The check in and out went so smoothly.  Reception staff so friendly and efficient.  Also the food is great. We ate all our meals at the hotel because it was so delicious.  When I retuned to the US I realized that I left my IPad in my hotel room. I called them and they said no problem we will send it to you. I had my IPad back within the week!  This is the best hotel in London. You will be extremely satisfied!"
July 2015,Top hotel,"Stayed here for the first time recently on business. The hotel is one of the best in the area, service is next to none - all staff very accommodating and attentive. The hotel is a grand old building, but very well maintained and absolutely spotlessly clean...cleaners seem to work very hard with great care.  Restaurant food amazing..... Was only a flying visit, but am looking to come back soon for a stay with my partner."
August 2014,First Stop London,"This is a much overdue review of The Milestone.  What an absolutely wonderful experience.  My daughter and I took a trip of a lifetime last August.  London, Paris and Rome.  Our first stop, London.  AmEx helped make all of our arrangements and we chose The Milestone based on the tripadvisor reviews.  Last year The Milestone was ranked number 1, has fallen to number 2.  But I can't possibly imagine what the staff could have done better.  Congenial, comfortable and safe.  Not too far from the Tube."
May 2015,Outstanding Service and Elegant Location for Afternoon Tea,"While vacationing in London, I took my 4 year old granddaughter to the ""Little Princess"" afternoon tea at The Milestone Hotel.  From the moment we entered the hotel, all staff members we came in contact with were extremely friendly, kind and professional.  Each person gave special attention to my granddaughter and definitely made her feel as if she were a real princess.  Midway through our tea, she was presented with her own personal chef's apron and taken to a special dining room to decorate her very own yummy cupcake with their assistance.    We were seated in the cozy library close to the main lobby.  It was very tastefully  decorated and provided a comfortable setting.  We received outstanding service during our two hour tea time and tea and hot chocolate were kept refilled…"
June 2015,Nice choice,"Nice location for those who wish to avoid too  much racket and bustle. Nice service, as soon as you don't have (too) young receptionist on the day of arrival. Clean and comfortable, nicely decorated Deluxe suite, but the  cigarettes' smell that comes out of bathroom is unpleasant. The light snacks in the bar, well... This is less than nice. needs reassessment and refreshment. Good wifi, nice evening pianist in romantic and warm atmosphere."
May 2015,Ultimate pet friendly hotel,Great hotel to stay at if you have pets. We stayed one night with our dog and the staff were super welcoming.  Good location for doggy walks over the road in the park. Rooms are a bit busy for my liking and rather on the small size but very comfortable.
June 2015,Amazing afternoon tea,"I took my four and five year old girls to afternoon tea here and it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. The setting was very elegant and fitting for our Princess tea. Our waiter was amazing. He treated the girls like adults, gave them menus to read and just let them pretend they were grown ups. The food sandwiches, cakes and scones were delicious but far too much. I felt terrible that we left so much although they offered to box up my left overs for me. Overall it was a wonderful way to spend an afternoon and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
May 2015,Perfect on every level,"Brilliant location for getting about  some of the smarter areas of London as well as a few miles from some of the main attractions. The hotel was very luxurious in its service, its decor and its facilities - and when we had a problem with the room the manager just got it done with no fuss and minimum disruption or inconvenience. We had both the dinner and breakfast in the hotel and the quality was excellent - would recommend to anyone"
May 2015,Another superb visit to my other home,"I visited the Milestone for the second time in May and it was just as lovely and charming as before.  I have to give a huge thanks to Katie, Ilsa, Kasey, Nik, Josh, Jose, Bruce, Fran, oh my....too many to name. From Katie's assistance with moving my belongings from one room to another, after a slightly less than graceful dismount from my tub, to her smiling face when you arrived back from sightseeing. Bruce telling me where to get the best Chinese, then ordering it and bringing it to me. Josh telling me about comic con and helping print out tickets for several different events. Jose helping me report my lost camera. Fran helping me with my misbehaving TV. Kasey's ever present smile and humor. The rest of the reception staff for providing water and advice, the room service staff…"
June 2015,A must if ever visiting London,"Had the absolute pleasure of spending a night at the fantastic Milestones during our last visit to London. If you are looking for service and quality look no further! With it's great location you can enjoy fairytale views of the enchanting Kensington Palace - be sure to book a room facing Hyde Park! The style and interior design is breathtaking and you feel as if entering another decade upon check-in. Upon our arrival we were shown in to the Stables Bar where we were kindly offered welcome drinks and snacks. During our drinks Mr. Fran O'Hanlon, one of three wonderful dedicated butlers, retold the history of the property and once we've finished our drinks he gave us a tour of the rest of the Hotel. During this conversation I mentioned breafly that I was very interested in the…"
February 2015,Favourite London Hotel,"This is literally my favourite hotel in London and one of the best in Europe... Its literally sat opposite Kensington Palace which is a huge part of its charm. Its interior suits its location, very formally English however its flavour is a very cosy comfy English country sort of vibe.. The Hotel serves a traditional English afternoon tea, fabulous cocktails if desired.. Its location to all essential must see's in London and just on top of the West End. The Albert Hall is just around the corner.. I've stayed many times which is usually through the winter and its cosiness and charm makes for a definate return visit, time and time again .. Always a treat .."
June 2015,Great stay ....,"This beautiful, charming hotel is across the street from Hyde Park & Kensington Palace ---- a great location. The view of the Park from our room was very nice. Even being on a busy street there was very little noise. We had a peaceful, restful stay. This is a great location so walking was was a good option to several areas.  This staff really took pride in this hotel & their jobs --- this was obvious each minute of each day. We were always greeted with Smiling Faces & service was tops on their list.  As far as the bar & Restaurant, we found them to be good.  When back in London, we will stay here again ! "
June 2015,Such a lovely hotel,"My husband booked this hotel for our anniversary. From the moment we arrived we felt so welcome. The door man was such a lovely man who was so helpful with offering restaurant ideas and making sure we had a taxi etc. The reception desk staff were so polite, helpful and interested in where we were from and our reasons for the stay etc. Offering different services including help with restaurant choices, ideas of where we could visit in London and areas to avoid due to an event happening. We got shown around the hotel and shown to our room.  The room was lovely, over looking Hyde Park. The bathroom was a lovely size and very clean. Overall I love this hotel and definitely want to visit it again. Would love to bring the children so they can listen to the man playing the piano by the…"
May 2015,Afternoon Tea,"Our experience of afternoon tea at The Milestone Hotel could not have been better. It was a sixtieth birthday family celebration, including two young children, and the staff were extremely accommodating, both when booking and on the afternoon itself. The children thoroughly enjoyed their cupcake decorating experience, dressed in chefs aprons, and the adults were extremely appreciative of the delicious food! Our waitress was charming and attentive and, although not cheap, the overall experience was worth every penny."
June 2015,This place is NOT over rated,"I was a little skeptical at the highest rating and had to try it.   The service is perfect - so attentive, the rooms are so detailed and unique, the breakfast is delicious and the tea time is the best I have had.  I'm so happy I choose this place and highly recommend booking through Amex as your get a ton of perks."
June 2015,Truly a remarkable place.,"Across the busy street, we observe paparazzi stationed at entrance/exit points like bees surrounding a hive. Further up the lush green grounds, there is a long queue of global media personnel, electronic equipment, vans and transmission dishes, protected from the weather by a large, white tent-like tops. The media brandish microphones and cameras, and have already staked out Kensington Palace for a week, hoping to capture footage of visiting royals. Charlotte was born yesterday.   Staying in the Milestone Hotel, we are strategically located and in a far more lush boutique environment than that of the paparazzi. The Milestone was voted the ""Number One"" hotel in the UK and won the 2014 Trip Advisor Traveler's Choice award. it is a luxurious experience. And as you step inside you…"
June 2015,Very poor hotel,"A dreadful place, an old building, two in fact, conjoined and very claustropobhic. In the bar while another customer fell over on the marble floor with hidden steps, we paid £85 for a round of drinks for 7. The food was OK but a chicken pie for £27.00... I mean? It does not matter how rich you are, there are far better hotels and restaurants in London to take your money. Avoid this place as it is expensive and very poor. It is designed to extract the maximum from its customers. Please AVOID."
June 2015,"Fab hotel, fab location, excellent professional but friendly staff","I've travelled to every corner of the world and was surprised to visit my old home town and stay in probably the best hotel ever....breakfast chef definitely the best.  A great welcome from steven in his top hat (who came to my rescue as my handbag broke on the way out!)...4-5 staff immediately on hand when you enter, and its a small hotel.  Elsa went beyond the call of duty and had balloons and a yummy cake waiting for my birthday boyfriend.  I couldn't fault anything! They even light a candle in your bathroom at night....true class."
July 2014,Amazing,"Great food, great location, great breakfast, great rooms, great staff. As you have gathered by now this place is great!!!! Seriously, I could not remember something to fault them for.  The restaurant in the hotel is quite pricey but it is a real fine dining experience, I recommend you try it."
June 2015,60th Birthday Treat,"My girlfriend treated me to a wonderful London trip and we stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate my 60th birthday. It is, without question one of the best hotels we have been to. A beautiful, elegant building in a great location. All of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Our room was amazing. The English cooked breakfast was the best ever. There was even a home made chocolate birthday cake in our room upon arrival! We will certainly stay here again. Highly recommend."
June 2015,Good Taste of London,"Great service, great location. Staff was very welcoming on arrival. Size of room adequate for three. Excellent breakfast and had great dinner. About a 12 minute walk from the Underground, near Whole Foods and near the Parks. Highly recommend this hotel."
June 2015,Delightful stay,"Stayed here for the first week of June. Could not have had a more delightful stay at any hotel. They made us feel like one of the family in their home. The hotel is like an old sophisticated Kensington manor house. Everyone from the Doormen, reception, management, Concierge, Bar and restaurant staff and housekeeping were the best ever.  Breakfast was amazing, the Stables Bar was the best ever. They gave us many non-tourist suggestions for places to see and great local eateries. You must try Fiona's a few blocks for the hotel."
May 2015,Quintessential London,"If you had a fantasy of what the perfect London hotel would be, this is it!  My daughter and I stayed for 3 nights in May and it was not long enough.  Truly a highlight of our extended European holiday.  Perfect location, beautiful property and superb staff. Look for Steven the doorman.  He's awesome. Great breakfast, tea, and fast room service.  A Five star all the way"
May 2015,"Fabulous location, fabulous team","It is so lovely arriving at the Milestone, not only is it homely and aesthetically welcoming it is also something the staff feel immensely proud of which is infectious.  Patrizio welcomed us at the door and Nick and Georgia greeted us on Reception.  Nick speaks the most beautiful English, you could listen to him all day!  Georgia gave a tour of the property, pointing out all the features, opening times etc.  This is such a great touch, I don't know why more hotels don't do it.  The team goes out of its way to make you feel attended to.    The hotel is also in a fantastic location.     My only criticisms are: * it was never explained whether breakfast was included or not, I felt awkward having to ask. * the rooms have way too much furniture in them for the size of the room,…"
May 2015,Superb!,"The Milestone Hotel in Kensington is absolutely top notch. From the moment of our arrival on May 28, 2015 and until our June 1, 2015 departure it was absolute bliss.  The staff, food, facilities and service made our initial family stay in London a memorable and fantastic visit. A special thanks to concierge Andrea.  His restaurant recommendations, Eurostar booking and activity planning is better than any travel agent. He does it all with a big smile and the happiest of disposition. Rest assured you will be so happy if you have the pleasure of staying at The Milestone. It deserves a rating higher than a five star. "
May 2015,We will definitely be returning to The Milestone,"We've just returned home from a 3 night stay at The Milestone, and can fully understand why it is No.1 on TripAdvisor. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special. In fact, even before we arrived,  the lovely concierge team, Jose, Andrea etc organised all of our tickets and dinner reservations for us. Making our stay completely stress free. They even arranged a very special treat for our car crazy son ( a tour around London in a chauffeur driven Bentley). All members of staff were an absolute delight, offering an exceptional service being both friendly and professional at all times. Steven the doorman, always had the biggest smile on his face and was so helpful, even on our last day when he was feeling under the whether. During our stay we had breakfast, dinner and…"
May 2015,"Great Location, Exceptional Service",I choose this hotel because of the reviews and I did not want to stay at the usual big chains.  The staff and our apt. was amazing.  An apt. is the way to go if you are bringing family.  There was ample room for my daughters and my husband.  We all had our separate rooms since I booked the roof top apt.   From the moment we came we were greeted by Fran and Teddy who helped us will our bags and gave us a tour of the hotel and apt.  Andre and Joshua helped us with our tours and tickets.  The bus stop is near the hotel along with High Kensington Underground.  With Kensington park across the street we were able to feel we were not in the concrete jungle.  With the bus lines there are several that stop at the nearby bus station.  We went with Evans Big Bus that along with the other…
June 2014,"Amazing staff, lovely hotel, great location.","We had the pleasure of staying at The Milestone Hotel in London in 2013.  The location is great - opposite beautiful Kensington Gardens and the Palace, near shops and a short walk to The Albert Hall and the Station.  The room was beautifully decorated and with a high degree of comfort.  The staff were amazing!  We felt genuine warmth and consideration. They were only too happy to help us in any way but at no time were intrusive.  A wonderful few days. (Had to put 2014 as no option for 2013)."
May 2015,We will always stay here when in London!,"We can not say enough wonderful things about The Milestone Hotel in London.  From the minute we stepped out of our transportation from the airport to even after we had left, the entire staff at the Milestone treated our family like kings and queens!  Our room was ready and amazing!  The room service was fabulous and served so quickly each night and morning!  Each staff member was helpful to a point of going out of their way to assist us!  The Concierge- Andrea and his staff were amazing!  Manny took his time to actually retrieve a package for my son.  If there was a point greater than five stars - the Concierge desk would receive from us! They even assisted us with transportation after we had checked out because of an issue in Paris .  My husband and son enjoyed the  service in…"
May 2015,"The entire staff was truly first rate, especially the concierge and front desk.","This is only my first or second ever review of a hotel on Trip Advisor, but I just have to brag about this hotel. The concierge has an assistant, and they are both almost always on standby, available immediately. The hotel's overall level of service is the best I have ever seen. We used the concierge at all hours throughout our stay, and they exceeded our hopes on every occasion."
May 2015,Happy and friendly staff beyond compare!,"We would gladly have stay longer than our 3 nights! We were upgraded (due to our use of Am Ex Platinum reservation) to a charming room with amenities the best we've experienced in UK: both US AND international power outlets in several places - several with additional power switches to control hotel usage!; bathroom LED ceiling nightlight, 2 comfortable chairs with  ottomans for relaxing and tv viewing; a variety of clothes rods in the auto-lighted closet. The Concierges( Jose, Andreas and Josh) were all exceptional - getting us even the ""impossible"" tickets! Several venues  - all charming - for tea or snacks. Any question or request was handled with enthusiasm. Each mealtime we eagerly anticipated. The conservatory for tea with rains overhead was charming! We felt as tho we were…"
June 2014,Amazing place to stay,"I haven't stayed at the Milestone Hotel for the last couple of years (had to use June 2014) as a date because I wasn't given an option to choose an earlier date.   The Milestone is the best hotel I've stayed in London and I've stayed in a lot of them. The staff are a credit to the hotel & the concierge is the best I've encountered, table reservations for full up restaurants, theatre tickets for sold out shows - nothing is impossible for them.   The rooms have a lovely old world charm but lose none of the creature comforts that one looks for in a hotel. The gym is small but well equipped and with Kensington Palace grounds just opposite the hotel you will be spoiled for choice in case you fancy a jog or a walk outdoors.   Longer stay guests can't go wrong with the apartments…"
April 2015,Unique and lovely room.,"We asked for a room facing Hyde Park/Kensington Palace and gardens and were not disappointed. Although the room was small, the circular window facing the gardens in the step-up area was special and unique and we loved it. The room also had the largest bathroom I've ever had in London. Service was perfect and the hotel Concierge was personable and very helpful at suggestions, arranging side trips and making dinner reservations. If we ever get to go to London again, we will definitely stay here."
May 2015,Perfection on the park,"The Milestone Hotel is a dream worth remembering.  Located in Kensington, the Milestone delivers an amazing London experience. Exquisitely crafted out of three private homes, the hotel's rooms and suites are charming, well appointed and highly functional.  Each of the suites is unique, and it might be worth it to go back and experience each one.  The staff is uniformly excellent from the smiling doormen to the efficient concierge and management. The Milestone packs a lot into a small space - excellent food service, charming bar, good gym and famous afternoon tea. A highlight of the experience is sitting in the conservatory room either under the stars with a glass of wine or with a book and a cup of tea.  We stayed in the Regency Suite, and its amazing copper soaking tub brought…"
December 2014,A brilliant stay,"Stayed 2 nights. We had a lovely room with a 4 poster bed, copper bath, and sitting area in the bedroom. One night we had rose petals on turn down. Service was very good. The hotel is bang opposite Kensington Gardens so very handy for walking in the park or visiting Kensington Palace. Also handy for the shops and restaurants in High St Ken. We ate at the restaurant both evenings and the food was so good I had the same thing both times. Both times it was Superb. Breakfast was also very good. The building is full of period features and atmosphere."
April 2015,"Like home, only better","When you arrive at The Milestone, you are greeted with a warm smile by the doorman, Steven. From the second you lay eyes on him he is your loyal companion that will make the most out of every moment of your stay. Once inside, you are in competent hands that will ensure that you are well catered for. Everything is easy at The Milestone. The check in process, how your bags are handled, and the complementary welcome drink are just examples of services that - at a regular hotel - would feel a little awkward and tiresome but at The Milestone you feel as if you've been let into the home of a  good friends. You are taken on a tour of the facilities and of your room and once the door is shut behind you you feel utterly transported to another time and space. Small things, like the lovely…"
May 2015,"Luxury personified, look no further for the best!","My wife and I stayed at The Milestone for 1 night on Saturday 2nd May to celebrate my wifes birthday which is also our wedding anniversary, quite simply this hotel is luxury personified. On arrival we were immediately welcomed by the front desk team and greeted by our name, we were introduced to the hotel Butler Fran, he gave us a full tour of the hotel and then showed us to our room and explained all the amenities of it, we were pleased to hear we had been upgraded to Junior Suite room 402, the room was luxuriously appointed and had a large bathroom with the highest quality bathroom linen. We were offered a complimentary drink on arrival which we took in the elegant Stables Bar. We had dinner in Chenistons Restaurant, the cuisine was quite simply devine which was served with…"
March 2015,Ask .... and it shall be yours ....,"I cannot imagine a more accommodating place to stay .... anywhere.  Whether we were looking for a quick family dinner within walking distance, the best value in purchasing tickets or passes for London's subway/bus system, information on various museums, more of my son's favorite breakfast items (fresh yogurt and milk in the glass bottles and jars, and the French toast), nearby grocery stores or just a route for a neighborhood walk, the Milestone staff had it covered.  Without question, they were pleasant, funny, knowledgeable and efficient.  They even helped my daughter and her London friends figure out where to get the best deals on a particular clothing line.  The location can't be beat with Kensington Gardens across the street and a ""tube"" stop a block and a half away.  We…"
April 2015,Very comfortable and excellent restaurant,We stayed only the one night but would have loved to stay longer.  They ensured our stay was memorable.  We were celebrating our 20th Wedding Anniversary (China) and the relationship manager gave us champagne on the house and also sourced a lovely china cup and saucer crammed with chocolates as a lovely surprise.  The restaurant was superb.  From start to finish each course was a culinary masterpiece of taste.  I would certainly love to eat there again.  The lounge bar (Stables) was quaint and we had excellent service.  All the staff were attentive and couldn't do enough for us.  It is right opposite Kensington Gardens so lovely for a stroll.  The High Street Kensington is within walking distance.
February 2015,Wonderful Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at The MIlestone for a romantic night away and it was absolutely wonderful. We had a plan to just enjoy the hotel and relax and that's exactly what we did. We had our welcome drink in the bar, our dinner in Cheneston's (which was absolutely lovely), after dinner drinks in the bar and then retired to our room. Our room was a beautiful corner room with amazing views of Kensington Palace and park, it was well appointed with everything we needed including little treats that we were greeted with upon arrival. We had breakfast in our room instead of downstairs and I have to be honest, it was one of the best parts of our stay! I don't know why I don't do it more often when travelling.The selection of food was gorgeous and plentiful and it was so nice to just sit…"
April 2015,25th Anniversary Trip,"The attention to detail that the staff provides was above and beyond. At check in we were treated to champagne and delicious pastries. On our first night we returned to our room to find chocolate covered strawberries and rose petals strewn throughout.  English breakfast was included and was delicious (Eggs Benedict, omelets, soufflé pancakes and pastries and more). The hotel is conveniently located by the Tube, Kensington Palace, shopping and great restaurants.  The concierge emailed us prior to the trip recommending sight seeing locations including an exclusive tour of Buckingham Palace (our trip highlight)which we would have missed had it not been for him (we didn't know this tour was available, thinking the palace was only open in the summer). The staff was friendly and…"
April 2015,"Five Great days at the Milestone, London","Through my travel agent in Ft. Worth, my wife and i enjoyed the benefits of the Virtuoso connection to the Milestone. We are not strangers to London. This hotel left us both very happy and relaxed and thrilled about coming back soon. The hotel is spotless and extremely clean. We cannot think of a single negative element of the facility or the wonderful staff.  Again, the staff made the difference, as all were refreshingly happy and friendly--   The very best i have ever experienced."
March 2015,First class,"We stayed as we were seeing Madame Butterfly at the Albert Hall. The hotel is a short walk from the hall, opposite Hyde Park and near Kensington High St. The building and rooms are lovely and of the Regency period. The staff are excellent. The hotel was featured in the Sunday Times as being one of the best companies to work for and it shows in the care and attention you receive. Genuinely helpful and couldn't be better - well done to the Milestone Team. "
March 2015,Everyone is right.  It's that simple.,"Just spent a week at the Milestone with my son.  Got back last night and I'm already writing this review.  OUTSTANDING HOTEL.  From the minute we arrived to the moment we left, this hotel experience was top notch in every way.    Now for the irony:  Our room was not ready when we arrived and the room we checked into was too small for me and my teenage boy.  The way the staff (Beth you are a consummate pro) handled this situation from beginning to end was flawless.  Let's face it:  Things will go wrong at even at the finest hotels.  The experience you have when things go wrong is far more telling than the experience you have when all goes as planned.  When our room was not ready, we were kindly guided to the gorgeous conservatory and fed a delightful lunch on the house.  When I…"
March 2015,"We felt more like ""old friends"" than like guests!","As a family with two children we had the opportunity to stay for a week in the Victoria&Albert apartment of The Milestone Hotel located directly at Kensington Gardens, London. The apartment was spacious (two bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms, a large living room and a very well equipped kitchen) and we felt that the interior design was typical for Great Britain. The whole staff was incredibly helpful, and we felt well very well accommodated, e.g. my wife and me had some problems with the pillows provided, but when we mentioned this to the concierge, he showed us the hotel´s ""pillow menu"" and we were provided with most comfortable memory foam pillows, thus, in the remaining nights we slept perfectly well! Even short-timed questions as ""Could you get us 4 cards for the musical…"
March 2015,Thank you all so much.,"Dear Andrew and staff.  This hotel is the best of the best.  My wife and I stayed 4 nights at The Milestone, and I do not know how it possibly could have better.  All of the staff(too many to name) were very helpful and accommodating.  Superior service, coupled with a genuine friendly attitude made our stay very memorable. Thank you all so much for your warmth and hospitality. D.Wagner, MD"
February 2015,First class service !! Lovely hotel all around.,We just returned from spending two nights at the Milestone.  The staff was wonderful and they make you feel so welcome.  We had the Matisse room --- ceilings are a bit low and there area few steps down.  It was beautifully furnished. It has small windows and is rather dark.  The welcome note and basket was much appreciated.  We also enjoyed a proper cream tea -- and a trip to the bar was met by a wonderful bartender who clearly takes pride in his job and the hotel  Breakfast a delicious experience.  We would happily stay here again.
January 2015,magic moments,have a goodnight sleep here Plenty to do   You can do all most anything here Night life is amazing local bars Maybe an adventure for you And very disability friendly lifts Ramps   You try it you will have a good time
February 2015,Living like royalty,"we stayed with our children (7&9 year old girls) and only had positive experiences. The staff was extremely warm and welcoming on arrival and the concierge team was very helpful throughout our stay in London. The restaurant at the hotel was first rate and the high tea was something our girls will soon not forget. The hotel location was ideal across the street from Kensington Gardens a few minute walk to several museums, shopping, restaurants and the tube. Every night we looked forward to receiving a small treat as part of the turn down service. We would definitely stay here again."
February 2015,WOW! This is the best hotel experience I have ever had,"I have worked in hotels and food & drink for a long time now and I have never, ever experienced service like I experienced last night from anyone - full stop.  Every member of staff that I came into contact with knew my name. Plus the (small) big things like the soap selections in the room, quality of brands on show and how guest centric the entire hotel is. It was just incredible.  The team were outstanding - Ben, Augustine (sorry if I got that one wrong), Leona, Marianne, The Concierges, the doormen. Every single one of them is a gem. Knowledgable, helpful, interested in you all with a nothing is too much trouble attitude.  A special mention goes to the restaurant and bar. I have to say the scallops and the steak are the best I have ever had, hands down. The wine selection was…"
February 2015,Flawless!,"Flawless experience in London.  Fantastic location and service in every domain was excellent.  Large room for London with nice amenities.  The ""welcome drink"" in the bar was a nice touch and much needed after traveling for over 12 hours.  Beautiful hotel, we will certainly return."
January 2015,Prince Albert Suite! always and forever,"We arrived in a Bentley, and were treated like kings! we were celebrating our 5th anniversary and  our check in staff, his name was Jose, he was absolutely welcoming and seamless in the process. He indiciated our room was one of the best and proceeded for our bags to be taken up whilst we enjoyed a glass of Moscato, which is my favourite.  Arriving into our palatial suite, we hard our jaws hit the floor, it was certainly worth every penny. The views i wouldve gladly killed for, my bedroom was bigger than my living room at home and the bath, i wanted to drown happily aha!  We informed them we liked to entertain a few friends for a dinner party, they couldnt be more obliging! set up the table in a most efficient and classy fashion. As our guests arrived, each were handed a glass…"
December 2014,Two days of utter bliss,"Beautiful hotel.  Tons of character. Perfectly located for Kensington Palace and the shops along Kensington High street. The real stars of this hotel are the staff: Fabricio, Ben, Josh  and Teddy to name but a few.. Everyone made me feel so welcome. My two pooches also came along - talk about spoilt rotten: the hotel provides pet beds, towels, toys, pet food and doggy room service if required!! The pets can use 90% of the hotel, but there are restricted areas, which is perfectly fine, for this class of hotel.  The rooms are glamourous - maybe not to everyone's taste, but I love their OTT fabrics and furnishings....  The bathroom was spotless.. The room and maid service was excellent. The food in the hotel was delicious... breakfast was pricey but extremely plentiful...    This…"
December 2014,Wonderful stay,"Stay here for two nights over Christmas.  Met all expectations!  We were upgraded on arrival to two bedroom suite, which was great with kids.  Milestone made stay extra special with many, many special touches.  Many thanks to the Milestone staff for the memorable stay."
December 2014,A Perfect Stay,"Our first stay at this wonderful hotel lived up to the great reviews by others!  The staff at check-in could not have been nicer. We appreciated the early check-in which helped us tolerate our jet lag.  Loved the room with and all its nice little touches and the view of Kensington Palace. Everyone on the staff was pleasant, very competent, and helpful.  This hotel is in a wonderful location, and we enjoyed long walks in every direction."
December 2014,Pampered to perfection,"I cannot say enough great things about this hotel!  From the moment we arrived, we were impressed with the friendly and efficient greeting by the doorman, the front desk staff and Nick the butler. My husband and I stayed in the lovely room 509 and our two teen daughters were in the equally charming room 505. The hotel has achieved the perfect balance of traditional Victorian elegance and charm mixed with modern comforts, technology and convenience in the rooms and bathrooms. Delicious treats were found in both rooms each day. Breakfast in the cozy dining room was superb, whether you order a full English breakfast or simply the continental buffet. One tiny complaint was that during the four days we stayed at the hotel, our family could only eat breakfast together once as there…"
December 2014,Milestone Hotel,"Happy New year to the Milestone again and thank you for making our New Year special yet again. My Re-View 2008 you would think that i would need to write a complete new one on the Hotel yet they cease to amaze me from the first point of arrival to leaving was excellent so if you need to feel special go spoil your self with Fab surroundings and Staff that make you feel so welcome so please go and enjoy time out from normal life my thanks to all the staff that took the time to make it special,  Well were do i begin we stayed at the milestone hotel from the doorman to the housekeeping we was treated as if we was royalty we stayed new years eve and woww what a room it overlooked the park all the little fiinishing touches was fantastic from fluffy pillows to new year stockings how…"
November 2014,Wonderful week in a family apartment,"We stayed in the William and Kate apartment, and it was perfect for our family of 2 adults and 2 teenagers. We appreciated having 2 bedrooms, a sitting room, and kitchen.   What makes the Milestone so special, though, is the outstanding service from the staff. Housekeeping was impeccable, especially considering the size of the apartment. We also received outstanding service from the concierge desk on an almost daily basis. I can't praise the concierge team enough.  We ate breakfast one morning at the hotel restaurant, and it was delicious. We also enjoyed our afternoon tea in the lounge.  I would highly recommend the Milestone to anyone, especially families for the apartment option."
January 2014,Very nice stay, Well if a little on the rough side I need is serviced at the front desk in the lobby they were a little rude and I didn't care like what they were doing a room and everything was better the room was beautiful had a good time at the pool was amazing and yeah there was so much more to do a lot of people and said this hotel is okay it's really picky for me
December 2014,Rude room service,Poor and rood room services staff not much to chose  Noisy  Expensive not match what you get Stay away from service elevator you won't be able to sleep it is like adril in the bed I prefer Bagilioni hotel
December 2014,Best service ever! Simply outstanding!,"You Know that this is not your ordinary chain hotel when you get a letter before your arrival asking for anything from pillow preferences to yoga mats. As it happened it was our anniversary and the attention from the staff was outstanding and made our stay most enjoyable.  Gifts and personal notes, chocolate-dipped strawberries in the evening. They even made us some hot chocolate to enjoy by the fireplace after a cold evening out. The room was large (by London standards) and had plenty of character and all the comforts you'd expect at a 5-star hotel. Breakfast was also excellent, so we'll forgive them for having a rather small pool. All in all a very enjoyable and memorable stay. Highly recommended!"
December 2014,A fabulous hotel which surpassed expectation,"I booked the romance package deal for my husband's 40th birthday, which included one night's stay, breakfast, pink champagne on arrival etc. I had read the trip advisor reviews beforehand and expected superb service and staff and was not disappointed. Upon arrival, I learnt that we had been upgraded to a junior suite, which was absolutely amazing. The staff were warm, friendly and as my husband commented, always knew what you wanted - taxi; luggage storing; bag for a selection of Christmas themed Chocs from the help yourself bowl on reception - before you even did! Everything about this hotel was 5* quality and we couldn't fault a thing. The decor is beautiful and in keeping with the age of the building. The general atmosphere is one of exclusivity coupled with a unique charm.…"
November 2014,Tradition and Quality at its best,"I don't write reviews but I read many. It's time to break that tradition to applaud all those at the Milestone who clearly believe quality, tradition and customer care should not be compromised. It's true, from the moment you arrive to the last farewell nothing is too much trouble. I have been fortunate and been to many ""5 star hotels"" but this is something else, a cross between Cunards ""white service"" quality and being with a warm-hearted grand country family. The attention to detail, gifts in the rooms for my daughters, my mother and my husband ( although WiFi and a good TV was enough for my girls!) and the beautiful dining room and fitness suite allowed us all to be more than content. If you believe in quality, the personal touch and elegance don't go anywhere else."
November 2014,Great place,"Having never stayed at the Milestone we really didn't know what to expect but we certainly could not have wanted a better location nor more attentive staff. This small hotel really made us feel welcome and the afternoon tea was the best we have ever had and yes we have had a few!  The staff were friendly but professional and the attention to detail was second to none, without picking out staff for a special mention, Ben the bar man went that extra mile to make the final celebration of our Ruby wedding that much more special. Would we stay again of course we would, it's not the cheapest hotel but it really does offer something special."
March 2014,A stunning weekend,"I stayed here in March 2014 with my partner as a special treat to both of us (my partner thought I would propose but I did not sadly, did later in year though!)  The welcome Joanne and I received was truly lovely and a special mention must go to our genial and well informed host who showed us round the hotel. Our room was located on the second floor and was furnished to the highest standards with not a thing I noticed wrong or out of place. This was our second visit to a Red Carnation Hotels Group property and the constant standards continued throughout.   We enjoyed a champagne lunch in the Horse Racing themed bar, the champagne, food and wine all of a high standard - we recommend the house white made by the owners!   The Welsh doorman provided expert advice on travel and…"
November 2014,"Service, style and staff","Wonderful location for my visit and though I was an early international arrival, I was quickly made to feel at home and escorted to their library for afternoon tea and within 30 minutes arriving at my room.  That was the beginning of the service I would receive over the next three days.  Attentive, accommodating staff providing the friendliest and most efficient service and always made certain that I had everything I needed.  I enjoyed the traditional decor and the cleanliness of my room and the hotel as well."
November 2014,Excellent Place,"Excellent place to stay and have functions.It can be fantastic facility and building is at excellent form which is actually impressive. Food is good, service is nice, Atmosphere is clean and so is the location.Full suggested by any means!"
November 2014,Excellent in everyway,"We go to London two or three times a year - only place we will be going is the Milestone Hotel - they asked how much we will give them out of 10 - we wish that we could give them more than 10 - fab place you can go over and over again - food, friendliness, rooms, locations, staff - you cannot ask for more - infect you do not need to ask its there for you to enjoy - if you are in London its a ""must"""
November 2014,Five Star in Every Way,"We chose to stay at The Milestone after reading the rave TripAdvisor reviews  to celebrate a special birthday for my wife and wanting somewhere near to the Royal Albert Hall as we had booked for Classical Spectacular there.  The hotel was superb with excellent decor and furnishings and the service, helpfulness and friendliness of the staff couldn't be faulted.  In  particular I would single out Andrea, the concierge, who went to endless trouble to secure a tour of the Albert Hall for us at quite short notice.  We stayed three nights and had an afternoon tea one day and dinner in the restaurant another evening in addition to breakfast each day and, again, it was all top notch which, of course, it should be in a 5* hotel.  If you are looking for really top class service and, like…"
November 2014,Royal Albert Hall Visit,"My darling husband booked this hotel for a surprise for me. When we arrived we were greeted and told at check in we had been upgraded to a deluxe room. Then given a tour of the hotel, before being shown to our room by a lovely gentleman ( PEDRO ). The glass of champagne on arrival was just bliss. We attended the Royal Albert Hall for a show. Knowing we were going back to the milestone was the icing on the cake to finish off a wonderful romantic day. Breakfast before leaving was exceptional. Words fail me to continue, all that's left to say is, WE WILL BE BACK MRS JOANNE GAGE"
January 2014,Milestone Hotel,"This is a wonderful place to stay for a peaceful and luxurious retreat from the city bustle. My husband and I stayed at this marvelous hotel in late August 2003 (honeymoon). We were upgraded to a beautiful room (310) overlooking Kensington Gardens and were thrilled to find flower and chilled champagne awaiting us. The service was consistenly perfect: staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Bathrooms with beautiful caramel marble and Penhaligons toiletries! This hotel is small enough to feel cozy, but it is definitely a luxury hotel in every sense (Leading Hotels of the Wordl and Five Star Dimandon Award)."
December 2013,Great Christmas Stay!,"Our family stayed here for the week of Christmas.  The staff were friendly, professional and very helpful.  We had a ""Christmas tea service"" on Christmas Eve and it was incredible.  We had a Christmas tree in our room that they decorated and they even delivered us Christmas presents.  Great location too - we walked across the street and strolled through Kensington Park on several occasions."
November 2014,MJR- my recent stay at The Milestone Hotel,"Having stayed previously at the Milestone Hotel we wanted a hotel in the area that fulfilled all our requirements. With good memories from our earlier visit the rebooking decision was straightforward. Often a revisit never matches the first visit but this hotel is so different with such  depth to all its services and qualities. Reluctant to leave, we are already thinking of a reason to arrange a future stay when in London as The Milestone Hotel really does specialise in quality and addictive indulgence."
October 2014,Clearly the BEST Boutique Hotel in London,"I highly recommend the Milestone Hotel for their excellent service, décor and food.  From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave there are friendly staff, who know your name, and are committed to attending to your every need.  I was personally greeted by Andrew, the General Manager, who made me feel more at home.  Being an avid National Trust member, Andrew personally gave me a tour of the hotel, showing me all of the wonderful rooms and services that I could enjoy during my visit. Although small, the hotel has everything you could expect for a 5star establishment, a well equipped gym and personal trainer service, spa, swimming pool, and many areas to enjoy fine or casual dining.  I personally enjoyed listing to the skilled pianist!  During my visit I very much enjoyed…"
November 2014,Commitment to excellent service,"I highly recommend the Milestone Hotel for their excellent service. From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave there are friendly staff, who know your name, and are committed to attending to your every need, from concierge, to dining to business and relaxation services. You can't go wrong with this excellent and impeccably decorated hotel. Jamie Turkington"
September 2014,"Best in London, outstanding service, rooms, location","I have stayed in The Milestone many times. One year I was their most frequent visitor. My favorite hotel, certainly in London. Directly at Hyde Park in South Kensington it has a really nice location. All rooms are individually decorated, all in old English style. You will love them even though the rooms are small. Staff is very attentive. I love the place."
November 2014,Amazing Stay,"I stayed here on the 01 November as a present to my wife, the hotel staff and service was superb. they even baked a cake for her at no extra charge. The breakfast is very good, highly recommend the eggs benedict....cannot fault the room and they have full sky tv !!"
November 2014,My favourite Hotel anywhere,"This is the third time I have stayed at the Milestone and I did not think it could get better, but every time it does.  The staff are so dedicated and warm.  The service is unobtrusively excellent.  The food is delicious.  The ambiance is perfectly British in the very best sense.  It is cosy, comfortable, discrete, and I would stay for weeks if I could. Thanks to all the wonderful staff under the leadership of Andrew Pike.  Hope to see you again.  Helen Zille"
October 2014,You won't be disappointed!,"We recently took our first trip to London celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. The Milestone is a small hotel with fantastic personal service and an amazing staff. Colin picked us up from the airport in the hotel's range rover and his wonderful warm welcome set the tone for the whole stay. The restaurant provides an intimate and lovely dining experience, and the bar was fun. When we returned to our room the first night  whole place was sprinkled with rose petals! Milestone, if you are reading this...... Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
October 2014,"Awesome Service, Great Room, Excellent Atmosphere!","We just got back from a 6 night stay at The Milestone Hotel and are still in awe of the experience that we had. This was our first time being in London.  We booked our stay through Costco for our trip to see the Lions accidentally beat the Falcons (yay!).  Our concierge service was outstanding, EVERY question that we had was answered and pleasantly handled...even the most mundane questions. When you're there make sure to seek out Andrea as he took a little more interest in us (he has Michigan ties).  The room was beautiful and very quiet. The cleaning staff was beyond reproach and just as helpful and friendly as everyone else.  Our package also included a Daily English Breakfast, which was great. The main restaurant, Cheneston's, was outstanding. We had dinner there our first…"
October 2014,Up for a show,We came up to London for a show at the Albert Hall and stayed a night at the Milestone.  This is a special place in London as it it quite a small hotel but the service really is first class.  The staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble.  We were shown around by Pedro when we arrived (thank you) and later in the evening enjoyed an excellent meal  served early as we wanted to eat before the show.  I think the hotel is good value considering the location and the city.  We will definitely stay here again.  One thing to note - I was concerned  about noise in the night as we live in an extremely quiet rural area - I should not have worried the room is well insulated from the nightime city life !
October 2014,Great Stay at The Milestone,"My wife and I stayed at The Milestone from Oct 9-12th then again on October 25th for one night around a cruise from South Hampton. Great all around experience and location, our stay was outstanding. Special thanks to Steven at the front door who was a great help and a terrific chap and Benjamin in the bar who we enjoyed very much spending time with. We expect to be back in May."
December 2014,"Splash out, it's well worth it!","Fabulous hotel from the moment you leave the taxi to be greeted by the doorman with a light up smile. All staff were friendly & helpful. The personal touches make this hotel outstanding. Stunning room & huge bed. The gifts in the room, the hand written welcome letter, the huge fluffy towels & soft thick robes. Beautiful breakfast & attentive but not intrusive staff. Thank you!  I could get very used to this standard!"
December 2014,England done well!,"If you are looking for a classic hotel that is not on Park Lane or within the midst of tourist this is your place!  Charming lobby, awesome lounge and classic bar in the back of the hotel.  This hotel has a very homey feel because the staff is truly amazing.  They are there when you need them, but not in your face every time you turn around.  An example of how good the staff is, was one morning at breakfast I overheard a couple trying to order porridge with some items on the side.  After a few moments of the customer trying to organize their thoughts regarding honey, raisins brown sugar and other goodies, the waiter said, ""How about you tell me exactly what you wish and I will do my best to make it come true"".  A few minutes later there were two bowls of porridge and a whole…"
October 2014,Spectacular,"It was absolutely a dream, from the professional but warm welcoming, to the room very tidy and clean, nothing to complaint about it. Great location, a wonderful and unforgettable experience, I even recommended my parents."
June 2014,London's Finest!,"I had recently graduated and was traveled to London and Paris with my mom and aunt. My aunt chose this hotel and I was speechless when we walked into the lobby. This place is impeccable. It started with the a friendly staff welcoming us to town and giving us advice on places to go and eat. The place itself was beautiful from the inside to the outside. There were many little rooms to relax and lounge. The room was the ""African"" room with the decor being just that (cheetah, leopard, zebra, etc.) It was odd and unexpected but it was cozy. I was stuck with the roll away bed, which was surprisingly comfortable. The linens were so soft and warm that it was a great night sleep every night. We dined a few times in the dining room which was just as great as we could have imagined. This…"
November 2014,Everything it promised it would be.,A wonderful birthday trip for my husband. And his first trip to London. Our room was darling. You will sleep like an angel. Great breakfast. Fantastic concierge service. London was shining brightly. This is the place. Book it.
November 2014,Simply The Best,"I've stayed at many London hotels over the years, but since I discovered The Milestone I never stay anywhere else. I stayed there for almost 3 weeks this year whilst having day patient hospital treatment nearby and the friendliness of everyone was amazing - i never felt that I was alone. I was there 3 weeks ago with my wife - the concierge remembered that it was around the time of my birthday from previous visits. In fact it was the very day of my birthday and in no time at all a very choclatie birthday cake was delivered to our room. All of the staff make each guest feel very special and I really don't think you can ask much more - it's taken as read that with this standard of hotel the service, cleanliness, food, etc will be first class, which it is. However, don't all rush…"
November 2014,Wonderful break at The Milestone,"I have just returned from a two night break with my Mum at The Milestone Hotel. If you are looking for a hotel with impeccable service, delicious food and a relaxing, comfortable atmosphere, then look no further. When I arrived we were due to have Afternoon Tea, unfortunately my train was delayed, which meant we were late for our our time slot. When I did arrive I was welcomed by Frank and my bags and coat were taken for me, we were shown into the lounge for Afternoon Tea and received a complimentary glass of champagne. What can I say about the Afternoon Tea, it looked amazing and tasted delicious. We couldn't manage it all, and we're given boxes to take away the remaining pastries. Our bedroom was a deluxe twin room situated at the back of the hotel, so therefore was very quiet…"
November 2014,Lovely stay here,"Very Comfortable stay with marvelous breakfast. Lovely Bontique hotel with happy friendly staff, Great location. Would recommend and definitely stay here again. Comfortable bed, great facilities within the hotel and local area. I like the hotel very, very much!"
November 2014,"Totally faultless, best 40th present I could of given myself!","Stayed here for two nights for my 40th, the best service I have ever experienced and I run my own hotel! Regardless of the excellent location you already find yourself you could stay in your room the whole time and be perfectly content. We had already made food reservations in the city so didn't eat there but going off the breakfast I will certainly eat there on my return. A perfect luxurious two night stay, totally faultless."
November 2014,Very impressive problem management,"Having enjoyed afternoon tea on several occasions we decided to finish off a weekend of engagement celebrations by having Sunday afternoon tea at The Milestone for 14 of us. Given the numbers, The Milestone offered us the use of Windsor Suite to make it a private party. Through my focusing on the detail and failing to look at the bigger picture, there was a misunderstanding over the chosen date, which meant our party arrived a day earlier than expected! Fortunately, as hosts, we had arrived half an hour early, and the Windsor Suite was free. Suffice to say the problem was handled in an exemplary manner, and when the remainder of the party arrived 30 minutes later everything was ready, such that I am sure none of the group realised what had happened.  Tea was to the usual high…"
August 2014,Great hotel and great staff.,"We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is very nice, our room was perfect. The whole staff is very pleasant and friendly and knew us by name. The breakfast is excellent too! I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to London."
August 2014,Excellent choice for afternoon tea,"We had tea at the Milestone and it was fabulous. The ambiance and service were second to none. The tea was excellent and the sandwiches, cakes, and scones were beautiful and ever so tasty. I would love to stay at this lovely hotel the next time we are in London. It is an incredible property."
August 2014,Wonderful hotel where the staff goes above and beyond to meet your every request!,"We just completed a 3 night family vacation at The Milestone. The hotel is quaint and decorated as a beautiful English home. Each hotel room is decorated differently. We had two rooms and one was more beautiful then the other. The breakfast buffet is great with many options. Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu.  The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you.  We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy.  The personal service was the best we have experienced in any…"
July 2014,London's best home,"The Milestone is a unique experience in itself. The staff has an acute attention to your needs which makes you feel wellcome and at home. From the moment you arrive to when you leave you have everything is within reach.  We stayed for three nights and enjoyed every second of them. Details like extra thick glass in the rooms to block out traffic noise lets you sleep longer, a magnificent breakfast, the most friendly concierge and a lounge piano player who really knows his stuff made our stay unique.   The Milestone is our new home in London!"
August 2014,Suburb Afternoon Tea,"We had afternoon tea at the Milestone last year & it was suburb. This year we tried a different hotel for tea & while it was nice, it lacked the sophistication & special touches the Milestone offer. So, we went back to the Milestone for tea again this year. The staff are all very welcoming & friendly. They were helpful with the stroller & had a high hair for us. The kids each had their own pot of hot chocolate & their own mini tea tray, which they were thrilled with. Our adult tea was excellent, every item was delicious & beautifully presented. The champagne was also lovely. It'd be hard to try anywhere else for tea when the Milestone delivers such phenomenal food & service. "
July 2014,Simply the Best,"My husband and I stayed at the Milestone for 10 days in late July 2014, our third visit.  The Milestone is simply the best hotel in London.  Outstanding service, friendly and knowledgeable staff, the concierge team was outstanding, fast and very capable.  Be sure to take advantage of the various services offered, including the drivers, like Colin, who took us on a wonderful tour to Bath and Windsor Castle.  The Master Suite where we stayed was extremely luxurious and had anticipated every need and comfort as well as lots of extras mentioned in some of the other reviews.  The location cannot be improved--across the street from Kensington Palace with Kensington Gardens that adjoins Hyde Park--allows for a beautiful view as well as outstanding exercise and picnic opportunities. …"
August 2014,Superb 5 Star Experience,"We just returned home from an 8 day trip to London where my husband and two teen sons stayed at The Milestone Hotel.  From the time of my reservation inquiry through our departure, we could not have asked for a better experience.  The reservation and front desk staff responded to all my communications in a prompt and courteous manner, and the hotel staff including the concierges and housekeeping staff were amazing during our stay.  The entire staff was kind and helpful and genuinely interested in making certain we had a wonderful stay.  My son celebrated his 14th birthday during our stay and they delivered a birthday cake to his room!  The rooms and the decor of the hotel is very charming old English, and the bathrooms are lovely and modern. My sons enjoyed the workout room as…"
August 2014,Perfect yet again,"I've lost count of the number of times we have stayed here. And it's always a total delight.  The rooms are comfy and stylish.  The public areas of the hotel are welcoming and invite you to linger.  The staff are all, and I mean all, polite, friendly, attentive and excellent at what they do.  I can recommend the spicey Bloody Mary's in the bar, served with amazing yummy nibbles.  The only negative point is my own fault - one night was not enough! I need to stay longer."
November 2013,Possibly one of the best hotels in the UK? Even the world?,"As a frequent traveller to London, I've stayed in numerous hotels - from low budget to supposedly luxury. I actually booked the Milestone almost by mistake, as I'd left it too late and couldn't find anywhere else nearby. From the moment I arrived I was absolutely blown away - by the service and the quality of the entire place. It's like no hotel I've ever stayed in... It was clear we had arrived somewhere special when - at nearly 11pm, when tired and weary from a long journey, a man knocked on my room door dressed in a pristine white suit, brandishing a complimentary glass of champagne to welcome me. On my bed was a 'pillow menu' listing about 15 different types of pillow that I could request for the bed!  Every last detail of the room was sheer luxury, from the hand-written…"
June 2014,Felt Like Royalty,"This Hotel was amazing!! It's a boutique hotel, so remember that when you visit. You wont get a commercial hotel feel at all. Everything is vintage to the hotels history, and the coolest thing is that all the rooms are decorated differently. We stayed in the Kensington Garden Suite, which had a living room downstairs with a very comfortable pull out couch, and a Beautiful master suite upstairs. The bathroom was so luxurious with very nice big bottles of shampoo, conditioner, bubble bath, and lotion. Elegant Bath shower combo with Gold fixtures. The bathroom even had a bidet! Being in our 20's we spent a lot of time getting ready to go out on the town. The bathroom comfortably fit two us in their at a time and there was also a vanity and mirror in the bedroom. Just remember to…"
August 2013,Classic Hotel,The Milestone is one of the best hotels to stay at in London. The services were excellent. Breakfast was delicious and a traveler feels like it is their home when staying there. We would definitely go back
June 2014,Another wonderful stay!,Our 2nd visit this year to The a Milestone. The romantic turndown was very special with champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries. Thanks to all the staff at this wonderful hotel for yet again making our stay so lovely.
May 2014,Traditional hotel in Kensington,"We stayed here for one night at the end of a London/Paris trip before we flew out of Heathrow the next day.  My husband and I are 30 and I wanted to splurge on the last night of our trip.  This is a traditional, mature hotel that I would probably recommend for an older crowd.  Upon our arrival, we booked afternoon tea for that afternoon, which we loved.  The food was delicious, especially the scones, and we had a great time.  That evening we walked through Kensington Gardens, right across the street.  The staff was great and we arranged for coffee in our room with the wake-up call early the next morning.  They also helped us figure out the most economical way to get to the aiport since we did not want to take a private car (we love quality public transportation).  The only…"
June 2014,Fox News and Really Fast Easy WIFI!,"We arrived a bit early on Sunday but the room was ready. We were offered a tour of the facilities and learned all we needed to know. It really is like being in someone's home.    #202 King was a good room on the back side, so quiet.   After freshening up a bit we went down to the Stables Bar to have our complimentary drink. Listen all you dopes, obviously we paid 510 per night and a free drink doesn't matter, but it does. It started a really valuable relationship with the lads at the bar. I'm horrible at names, they were from Italy. They listened to what we liked and made some amazing suggestions. We arrived one day when the lads weren't there and the other bartender knew our names and what  we wanted. Order the mixed sandwiches, really good. And they have Twiglets for bar…"
June 2014,Gorgeous hotel with lots of old English charm,"I have just returned from a mini break to London for my 30th birthday. My husband chose the Milestone as a surprise and he couldn't have picked a nicer place. The staff were lovely and very accommodating I stupidly forgotten a brush for example rang down and they found me one within minutes. Our room was a safari suite and it had great decor, the bed was extremely comfortable. The room was all very clean and we had a lovely view over the gardens I think the only thing people may struggle with is the shower height as fairly low but there is large bath and hose type shower to use.... This wasn't actually an issue for us at all, but thought may help other specify rooms etc.... The afternoon tea was delicious it is fairly expensive but you do get a fair amount of food and…"
June 2014,"Ok hotel, but dont understand its over the top rating","Nice hotel, but a hotel like many others. Small, ""dusty"" rooms, old facilities (bathroom, TV, AC, etc), old (and again ""dusty"") furniture, old windows with bad isolation - i.e.  a typical London, Paris or Rome hotel that attempts to create an ""old Europe"" feel but is simply just old and stuffy.  Service and food are good, but not excellent. There are many comparable hotels in London and I really really dont understand how so many excellent reviews and so few average ones came about. Just because there is a welcome drink? There is really nothing super special about this place - as I said, its good, but definitely not in the top 10 in Lindon. Just the location and the look of the hotel from the outside (esp. during xmas) are really great - but even that has a drawback since the…"
June 2014,Perfect Hotel,This is a perfect hotel with  a very convenient and central location. This hotel deserves to be  the  recipient of a  Travelers Choice. Award. It is such a charming hotel with an exceptional staff.  The service was extraordinary.The room was very nice and comfortable. I look forward to our next visit.
June 2014,An amazing experience,"An amazing experience:  Upgraded free of charge. Fresh fruit in the room Luxury Sheets and Towels Complimentary Champagne, and Bottled Water, and soaps etc Fresh Flowers throughout the hotel. Room cleaned twice a day, even picking our clothes up and putting them on the hangers. Gorgeous Breakfast, with an amazing choice. Room peaceful, and fully air conditioned Gorgeous Shower Turndown service a must have Order Tea or coffee to the room, and get fabulous free biscuits with it (and a flower) Nothing to much trouble Want to know the best places to eat ask desk staff, wonderful local knowledge, want a taxi just ask, want an umbrella just ask, in fact anything we wanted we could have. Staff remembered our names from first time. To much more to list, but in summary if you want to be…"
June 2014,Perfect hotel for daughters's graduation gift!!,"Two weeks ago, my husband and I took our two daughters to London for their high school/college graduations.  We were simply overjoyed with our stay at The Milestone.  Their service is impeccable!  The breakfast was loaded with many goodies, more than ever needed.  The rooms, both deluxe and junior suites were superior.  The girls' room was absolutely adorable and perfect for them in a powder blue velvet with double twin canopies!  A surprise birthday cake was even delivered for one daughter's birthday!  Candles were lit in the evening in the master bath when we returned at night.  The observatory was one of our favorites stops for a drink or respite.  Both bartenders knew our special drinks and always had them ready.  Immaculada, our waitress for breakfast was  perfect!  Other…"
April 2014,convenient location,the bus stop in front of the hotel is very convenient.  the concierge is helpful. i suggest you contact them in advance for questions. the room is very clean and has nice amenities.  the afternoon tea was disappointing.  i thought it was expensive and not worth it.
May 2014,nice,"This hotel is just great! Small, stylish, very nicely maintained and furnished and perfectly located in the heart of London. All the rooms are different and the bar at the ground floor has a very charming bar man offering the ""best martinis in town"". The staff is very helpful and the rooms are just perfect. Nothing to complain about"
April 2014,"""Brilliant Stay!""","I came here with my friend.When we arrived we were welcomed by a friendly doorman.All the staff at the Milestone hotel made us feel very welcome.We stayed for a night and woke up and headed downstairs to breakfast it was delightful,we had a full English and were rather full after the delicious breakfast because we couldn't get enough of it.I would advise you to come and stay at the fantastic Milestone hotel.We would defiantly stay here again!!"
May 2014,"Classic, cozy and compact!",I booked the Romantic option: and was it romantic: xxx! Excellent position across from the Kensington Palace Gardens makes for relaxed strolling. Efficient reception and very professional service all round. Attention to detail in the rooms all add up to a great stay: home away from home. The Orangerie is pleasant for a light lunch and the bar is very welcoming with live music in the Library in the evening. Close enough to the Royal Albert Hall to stroll back after a performace. 
April 2014,Lovely stay," I've had the pleasure of staying recently at two of the 4 star red carnation hotels (Montague and Rubens) and so was really looking forward to the 5 star Milestone hotel.  The welcome is warm and friendly but surprisingly my room wasn't ready so it was off to the bar to wait with a complimentary drink.  The bar is great, Markus is very knowledgeable and mixes a mean margarita and although the wait was long it wasn't unpleasant. Unfortunately a couple of the hotel management were having a meeting in the bar and it would have been better it this had taken place in an office ( I really wasn't interested in the gentleman bemoaning the rates at the Rubens).  Dinner was fabulous but very expensive. I spoiled myself with the wagyu beef fillet which was great and the wine…"
May 2014,Excellent Stay,"Had a wonderful 5 night stay at the Milestone. The location was convenient and accessible to all the sights. Having the park across the street is so nice. I walked through it almost everyday. The staff was warm, friendly, and so helpful. We loved the turn down service in the evening. I have never been to a hotel with such exceptional service. This hotel is truly worth every penny."
April 2014,one night stay,From entering through the doors of The Milestone we were cared for so well by the very professional & attentive staff. Every request was dealt with efficiently and always with a smile. In the middle of London this hotel felt like a calm oasis. The décor beautifully traditional. Breakfast was ample and drinking in the bar a pleasure. We made the mistake of turning down a 'turn down' and then seeing our friends room who had. It looked magical. So fellow guests never ever refuse a 'turn down' at The Milestone !
May 2014,Exceptional in every way,"Quintessentially English hotel with Staff that are without a doubt some of the most professional, dedicated, polite and friendly hotel staff we have had the pleasure to meet.  Immediately we were at ease and relaxed.  Afternoon Tea was a delightful experience, our suite was outstanding - clean, plenty of space, beautifully dressed - and our Full English breakfast was second to none.  We will certainly be back!"
May 2014,Unsurpassable,"After a long and eventful journey, my wife and I arrived at the steps of the hotel to be greeted by a very helpful doorman. The check-in experience was something we had only ever experienced at Scottish country hotels; friendly and relaxed, but deceptively efficient. Pedro showed us around the hotel and some of its facilities before showing us to our room, and what a room! We had dinner in the restaurant on the first night and the food was first class, fresh and extremely tasty. A couple of drinks in the bar with a very attentive barman and then a perfect nights sleep.  The breakfast selection was amazing and they had my favourite Haddock and poached eggs, washed down with excellent coffee. An excellent breakfast that set us up for the day which began by walking out the front…"
June 2013,FOREVER,"Typical English hotel, very quaint and elegant, clean, tidy and the food was great!  The waiters are at the top of professionalism. . .  the treatment reserved for us is indescribable, just arrived we were served and revered. Top marks ..."
April 2014,Lovely,"My husband and I checked into the Milestone after spending 4 nights at the Savoy.  What a change of pace!  The Milestone was so quiet - almost a little too quiet but after 4 nights on the Strand it was wonderful to get away from that action.  We were upgraded to a very nice room overlooking Hyde Park.  We were only on the 3rd floor but the way that they have the windows insulated you can't hear the traffic on Kensington High St.  Amazing!   We didn't experience the ""incredible"" staff the way that many other reviewers experienced.  I don't know if it's because we are a younger couple (in our 30s) and it seems as though the hotel attracts older guests.  Regardless, all the doormen were fantastic.  Fran also made us feel very welcome.  And Jose at the concierge was able to find a…"
May 2014,simply wonderful in everything,"My husband and I spent 5 nights at the Milestone Hotel and everything about this hotel and the staff is simply wonderful. From the moment you walk up the front steps it's like being 'at home'. This is not an easy feat for any hotel but the Milestone is not like any other hotel.   The Milestone is a complete oasis in a very busy city. The staff are always expecting you and welcome you home.  The rooms are beautifully appointed and the bathrooms are fabulous. You never have to worry if you've packed everything because the Milestone will have it. The food is exquisite. I would highly recommend you have dinner at the hotel, and please try the pork. It was the highlight of our stay!  We were treated like royalty - the care and attention to detail is something everyone should have the…"
May 2014,Not quite as good as the reviews,"Having chosen this hotel due to its billing as the top one on tripadvisor we had high expectations of our stay. Whilst we had a good time, it did not live up to the hype.  On booking with the hotel you are sent an extensive and detailed questionnaire about your fruit, welcome drink, DVD preferences and room facilities that you would like to be available. Having taken the time to fill this in and email it back to them we arrived in our room to find that all of the requests had been ignored. There was no fruit (stated to be complimentary on the forms), no DVDs, no tea or coffee making facilities and no welcome drink although this was subsequently offered (they clearly didn't know what we had earlier requested).  There are several areas you are shown around and told that you can…"
April 2014,Wonderful Stay,"My adult daughter and I just completed a wonderful 3 night stay at The Milestone.  Every staff member we encountered - doormen, front desk, concierge, wait staff, housekeeping, the bartender - was pleasant and helpful in a sincere vs. professionally nice way.  We selected a package that included breakfast, enjoyed in a different spot each day - the library, dining room, and room service - such a treat.  We met friends for drinks in The Milestone bar before dinner - it's a unique space that offers a few different, all extremely comfortable options to sit, chat, and enjoy yourselves.  The Milestone's location was perfect for our goal of walking almost everywhere - and we tried as much as possible to make Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park part of our route.  It's not easy for a…"
April 2014,"Simply put, Magnificent, Great Staff!",We saved the Milestone for our last night In London since it was our 30th anniversary of our marriage. We made the right choice! We were given a lovely room overlooking the park. The underground was on strike when we were there but it did not matter. Because we were there to enjoy the park and this lovely hotel. Even though the Milestone is lovely from the top to the bottom. It is the hotel staff that makes this a wonderful experience. They address you by name. always have a warm hello. Will go out of their way to make sure you have a enjoyable stay. Thank you to all the fine people of Milestone. Cheers!
April 2014,Wonderful afternoon tea,"On the 27 01 14 we took our granddaughters out to tea at the Milestone for the little princess tea the girls really enjoyed it they thought it was very posh , the staff were all so kind to them  they so enjoyed decorating their cup cakes we also enjoyed the tea the cakes were delicious, Would recommend  and go again"
April 2014,Meeting or exceeding our highest expectations as couple's city getaway,"My wife and I spent very memorable 3 nights at The Milestone celebrating her birthday. We chose The Milestone because it was very highly rated and recommended and was located within of our area of interest. On few of our recent vacations we have sampled different kinds of luxury hotels, classic and boutique types (also in London). We had generated very high expectations for The Milestone knowing that the hotel itself would be a major part of our short vacation experience.  Now reflecting our vacation I must say that the wonderful staff and literally spotless premises of The Milestone really succeed. The vast amount of details that were ""just right"" is mindbogling. Where do I start: the premises, execution of classic luxury style, unique flavour in room decorations, the number of…"
April 2014,Wonderful and Magnificent,"We've just enjoyed a long weekend in London, the highlight of which was our stay at The Milestone Hotel.  It is impossible to criticise or find fault with anything. The staff are warm, welcoming, attentive, friendly - in short, they turn an outstanding hotel into a truly great hotel. The recruitment and training must be extremely fastidious to achieve such brilliant end results.  In future, it will be our home from home when visiting London.  We cannot recommend The Milestone too highly, nobody will be disappointed by their stay.  Theresa Hale and Peter Gamble"
March 2014,The feeling of home,"I recently stayed at The Milestone in London and it is fantastic.  Warm, friendly staff, great rooms and super Afternoon Tea.  I highly recommend this property.  Check out their breakfast fruits in herb and spice syrups.  I'm going to try it at home. All of Red Carnation hotels are great and I consider this one the Star in their Crown in London."
March 2014,The Milestone is more than a place to stay.,"As good as The Milestone Hotel is as a place to stay it's real value is found in the staff.  Of course, the rooms are wonderful, the service outstanding and the location superb, but what really makes the hotel truly five star is the quality and character of the entire staff.  From the night turn down help to the people working the front desk and everyone else who works at The Milestone, the attitude is one of friendliness and concern.  There is always a smile on everyone's face and an overarching concern for the guest's well being.  It's more than good training that is being exhibited.  It is a genuine desire to make a guest's stay at The Milestone truly memorable.  Over the years my wife and I have been coming to The milestone I have come to know many of the people who make up…"
April 2014,Amazing,"This is a top notch hotel, all the staff and very friendly and helpful. There is no snootiness at all. Not a very big hotel but quality through and through.The breakfast was excellent and the afternoon tea first class. We only stayed one night after attending a concert at the Albert Hall (5 mins walk) but we will be back for sure."
March 2014,"One of the best in ""The Leading Hotels of the World""","We just returned from a month in Europe. We stayed at the Milestone for 3 nights. This was our second visit to this fabulous hotel. Everything was just as wonderful as it was the first time. The entire staff was very cordial, knowledgeable and helpful. We had breakfast every morning in the restaurant and dinner there on our last evening. The food is delicious and such good choices. We've stayed in many of the""Leading Hotels of the World"" all over Europe and The Milestone is at the top of our list! The rooms are tastefully decorated and the beds are the most comfortable ever! Love those linens! The location is great--close to a tube station and across from Kensington Gardens and Palace. The staff is very detailed oriented and committed to lending assistance in any situation. They…"
April 2014,surprise weekend away,"This was a surprise organised by my husband as part of my Christmas present. From the moment we arrived to the very moment we walked out of the door it was an amazing experience. The Hotel and it's staff are wonderful. Nothing is too much trouble and I felt we were treated like royalty. The personal touches were out of this world. The view from the hotel is amazing- Kensington Palace and grounds. What better view could you want. Even though it is part of a group of hotels, Red Carnation, it was very personal. The food is well cooked and plentiful and always served to a very high standard. Staff are on hand at all times to offer help and support from booking taxis to telling you about the hotel itself. My husband looked at some of the more expensive hotels in London but this is…"
April 2014,An oasis in a bustling city,"Having just spent four nights at the Milestone to end off a five week European adventure I could not let our stay go without posting my praises for this wonderful hotel.  Everything was exceptional. The food was terrific, we loved the afternoon tea particularly, we were eating leftovers for days. The attention to detail in the hotel is outstanding, there is not one thing I could think of that the hotel hadn't already taken care of. The staff were always courteous and friendly and very welcoming of our young son.   We were treated to birthday cakes, gifts and evening canapés. We felt very special indeed.   Having visited London in the past we know what a gem this hotel is. The location is great, short walks to buses, the Tube, shops, restaurants and of course Kensington Gardens.…"
March 2014,WOW!!! What a treat.,"We were treated to a stay here from our family a few weeks back and wow what a treat that was. Rooms was amazing, adored the location. Fantastic hotel :) I advised everyone to give this hotel a stay, will not be disappointed."
April 2014,A Home away from Home,"Our first trip to London was about 5 years ago. We told our travel agent that we wanted a lovely boutique hotel and she immediately suggested The Milestone Hotel. It was then, as it is now, a truly wonderful experience. The hotel itself is beautifully decorated and appointed. The staff is amazing as  we were made to feel very special. The breakfast is served in a lovely dining room, and high tea can be had in the parlor near the fireplace.Each room is lovely and different. This time we stayed in one of the apartments. It was amazing and everyone was most comfortable. The concierge was great in their selection of restaurants and theater. Kensington Palace is directly across the street as is a nice park for walking or running. The Milestone is truly a ""luxurious home away from…"
April 2014,Pushing the Boat out,"It was our 20th wedding anniversary, so if an excuse to ‘push the boat out’ was needed, this was it.  The Milestone is part of the Red Carnation Group, and we have experienced some of their other London hotels over the years.  A New Year party at the Rubens, and several visits to Hotel 41 in recent years; all enjoyable to some degree and we would go again.   The Milestone is at the end of Kensington High Street, where it becomes Kensington road.  It’s a short walk from the tube or a £20 taxi fare from main train stations.  It’s a busy and at times noisy road, but very convenient for the park and other central locations (museums, Albert Hall etc.). We were greeted at the door by a ‘Traditional Doorman’, rather like many large luxury hotels and ushered inside to the pretty…"
April 2014,Best of the best,"We are first time travelers to Europe, so when we decided to ""go for it"" we consulted, friends, travel experts, and tripadvisor for every city. From Hotel de Russie in Rome to Villa De Este in Lake Como, we stayed at extremely expensive highly rated hotels every step of the way.. and London was somewhat of a last pit stop on our way back to the states. My husband chose the hotel based on tripadvisor reviews. Burnt out from rude Parisians at the Mandarin Oriental in Paris, and tired from a four city trip to Italy, we arrived to the cheeriest, most professional, detailed, comfortable place and people we had yet to experience. I WISH we had spent more time here and less time in Paris. I love, love love this hotel, the staff, the attention to detail, the care they give.. and I am so…"
April 2014,No other place will do,"I enjoyed every second in this luxury hotel. Having never been to England before, it was really a first hand experience I will never forget. The weather was also doing it's best to shine. I felt very lucky to be there at that time. Such enjoyment I will come back and stay here every time I come to England."
March 2014,We love the Milestone,"My mom and I spent 4 nights at the Milestone last month. What we have experienced at this hotel was what ""customer service"" is all about. Every single staff gave a genuine smile and treated us as if we were their only customer. We love that the hotel was not too big and all the staff are attentive and caring. Breakfast was perfect and the afternoon tea with champagne was fabulous. The porter Abdi was very friendly and helpful. On our last day we asked where our favorite cookie shop was located and he went out to buy for us while we relaxed at the lobby. The concierge could fulfill all our requests..from booking the best seats at the theatre to recommending places to visit. There was a personal touch in every details. We would  recommend the Milestone to all our friends and will…"
March 2014,Good stay,"I stayed here with my husband in March 2014, because of the good recommendations here on Trip Advisor. The hotel has a great location, it is easy and convenient to get around, and we had nice long walks in the park and in the area. The hotel has a great service, but sometimes it felt a little too much. For instance, we said no thanks to a few of the offers from the staff, but they did not listen - just insisted, because it ""said so on the sheet"". At breakfast four different people stopped by to check if everything was ok...in just a few minutes. To us it felt a little intimidating. We had booked a room with a view, but was asked if we wanted a bigger room. A nice offer, but with no view we regretted the move. To us, the best thing was the turndown service, I just love it when…"
March 2014,Lovely stay at the Milestone,My husband and I just spent four nights at The Milestone during our first stay in London. From the moment of our arrival until departure our every need was met. All of the staff was pleasant and attentive. We ate breakfast in the hotel every morning and had tea one afternoon. Excellent service and food. We were able to easily navigate the city each day on the advice of Jose and James. They were so helpful checking our daily plan and offering tips. They helped us choose restaurants each evening and secured reservations for us. We enjoyed dinner at everyone of their recommendations. If we travel to London again we would defiantly stay at The Milestone!
March 2014,Wow! Impressed. A wonderful hotel.,"After having stayed in hundreds of hotels across the world the Milestone is in now firmly in my top 10. Could you do better in terms of trendy glamour? Sure, but this hotel goes the extra mile in terms of unbelievable customer service.  This well located (steps from High Street Kensington) hotel is intimate, rooms comfy, the bed sheets are magnificent and big, bright bathrooms all make this a great stay but it's the staff that put the Milestone into a different stratosphere.   From the moment you walk through the door you feel at home, happy and welcomed. The gift of home made biscuits and tea from the chef is accompanied with a hand written note from the exec chef, there was a card from management and then there's the fact everyone knows your name all combine into a lovely…"
March 2014,# One in Our Hearts,"Checking in to the number one rated hotel in London surpassed all our expectations. The Milestone sets the standard for premier service and amenities.  From the moment we arrived to the time we checked out we were 'spoiled rotten' as promised by the very helpful reservationist. From Steve the doorman, to Pedro the butler, to Jose and Joshua, concierges extraordinaire, our every need was attended to with enthusiasm.  Every staff member in the hotel works as a team member to serve the guest.  The restaurant staff, the bartenders, the bellman are all constantly on the ready to help accommodate any guest at any time.  High Tea at the Milestone was elegant and delicious as well as the breakfast served each morning.  It was hard to leave this hotel and re-enter the real world.  We…"
February 2014,High expectations - exceeded!,My wife and I recently had a trip to London and I had a tough time choosing a good hotel …. I  choose The Milestone for a few reasons but primarily based on the reviews on TripAdvisor - the reviews are excellent - I am generally quite cynical about reviews and thought it can't be that good - what can they do that make a hotel experience so special? -  well they can and the do - remarkable service - from each and everyone of the staff -  Well done The Milestone - Many hotels could learn a lot from yours!  not cheap but very very good ..
March 2014,Afternoon Tea with champagne at the milestone.,"I came to know about this hotel as i was looking for a place that has the feel of traditional afternoon tea in London. What a surprise this hotel was and what a revelation. The service starts from the doorman to the concierge to the maitre de of the parlor to the waiter who assisted us through all the tea sipping, finger sandwiching, bite sized desserts we can stuff our mouths with. I also can't forget to mention this was all followed by the flakiest scones with local jam and clotted cream you can eat. That is if you can after eating all the abundant first tidbits they provide you with. At the milestone you feel like you stepped into a bygone era where the tea room feels like your aunts parlor, that is if your aunt was a noble lady and you were in the 19th century. It was cozy…"
March 2014,Wonderful stay!,"Everything about our stay was perfect - the room, the service by all members of staff and the food and drink both in the Stables Bar as well as breakfast in the restaurant. My husband had arranged a romantic turn down while we were at the theatre and it was beautifully done. Thank you to everyone at The Milestone for making our first stay so special, we will be returning!!"
March 2014,One of the best small hotels in the world.,"The service is impeccable, the food and the presentation is excellent, the concierge service is wonderful. the location is supreme.  Without a doubt one of the best small hotels where I have stayed. Special mention to be made to the concierge, the tea service in the afternoon, the small intimate bar."
March 2014,This must be what it's like to stay at Buckingham Palace,"This is my first TripAdvisor review. I'm excited to share my experience from these past few days at The Milestone Hotel! I've traveled to London over a dozen times from the U.S. In the past I've always opted for the ""big name"" 5 star London hotels. I was excited to try something new this trip based on the advice of a friend and the terrific online reviews. This is a family run, small hotel that is part of the Red Carnation Collection, founded by Bea Tollman who was awarded best hotelier several years ago. The family feel is what makes the big difference. Everyone cares and it's totally genuine in and out. You can't train to this level of service if it's not genuine and at the Milestone it really is. This hotel is like Apple is to computer stores. Every detail has been thought…"
February 2014,Treated like Royalty,"To sum it up I felt like the Great Gatsby during our stay at the Milestone.  The Carnation Hotels in London are second to none.  The owners and management have found a special recipe for success in how the staff are consistently top notch and the food and accommodations beyond 5 stars!  We were pleasantly surprised when we first arrived to be upgraded to the Prince Albert room.  This room was jaw dropping in terms of its size, interior design, functionality, and ambience...pictures do not do it justice.  In fact it was hard to pull ourselves away from the room during the day to go sightseeing.  The dining room and lounges were incredibly cozy and the food and drinks were outstanding.  The staff were extremely engaged, and professional.  Everyone new our names from the minute we…"
February 2014,Afternoon Tea,"After coming here for afternoon tea on our anniversary I need to adjust all my previous ratings on Tripadvisor. The luxuriousness of the Park Lounge and reception is beyond what I could have imagined. The service is unbelievable, there is always someone nearby to ask. We went for the classic afternoon tea option which came with more than enough food for us: sandwiches, a selection of cakes etc. and freshly cooked scones. If you don't finish it don't worry they will pack it up in a box for you to take with you. One tip I would give would be If you use Foursquare you can get a glass of champagne free with each check in at the moment saving you about £9 (simple afternoon tea vs. champagne afternoon tea)."
February 2014,Perfection,"We have stayed in some wonderful hotels around the world and this has to be one of the highest rated. Best described as a boutique hotel offering impeccable service in high quality surroundings. The rooms are beautifully presented with everything a guest could ever possibly need. The bed is extremely comfortable and the bed linen is exquisite. The furnishings throughout the entire hotel are elegant and sophisticated.  It was our anniversary whilst we were staying and the staff went to considerable trouble to decorate our room with petals, night lights and treats such as chocolate dipped strawberries. We were offered champagne on arrival after a very swift, efficient check in. All the staff called us by name and nothing was too much trouble.   We were asked by a member of staff…"
January 2014,Hotel Heaven,"My wife and I spent two days at this historic hotel.  It was absolutely fantastic!  Our room was on two levels, with a view of Kensington Park.  We were greeted at the curb by a doorman in formal attire.  When our luggage was delivered, the attendant asked if we cared for Champaign (complementary).  The room had two wardrobes, fresh flowers, fresh fruit, candy, two TV monitors, a dining table, a sitting area, two sets of bathrobes (light and heavy), slippers, and a Bose entertainment system.  Their motto is ""No request too large, no detail too small"".  Every aspect of this hotel (decorations, artwork, furnishings, food, and especially service) is outstanding."
February 2014,"The Majestic, Magnificent Milestone","The Milestone Hotel is guaranteed to offer a truly wonderful home from home Hotel experience. The welcome received from everyone is absolutely incredible. The many personal touches, including those for our little dog, were so meaningful and goes to show that everyone at London's number one premier Hotel, really does care about their guests, be they two or four legged. The Hotel General Manager took time to hand write a personal welcoming letter, which meant so much. Our room was immaculate, inviting and extremely comfortable, everything we could have asked for, which resulted in a most restful and peaceful nights sleep. Dining is superb, offering an extensive menu, prepared and served beautifully. All the staff members excelled by nature of their individual warmth, kindness and…"
September 2013,The Milestone Hotel,"The Milestone is the epitome of luxury when staying in London. In fact, it is the favorite place to stay in the entire world for my husband and me, and we have stayed in many fine hotels! The rooms are elegantly furnished; the service is beyond excellent; and the location is lovely. I cannot praise the hotel and service enough.   Jean Matz Florida, USA"
August 2013,Great location,"Stayed for 4 nights in August 2013. Great location near Kensington Palace. Walking distance to many sights, shopping and restaurants. Breakfast is delicious and many options are available. The staff in the breakfast dining room remembered our preferences after the first day. Internet service can be inconsistent, if you are planning to do some work. Overall a lovely place to enjoy a visit to London!"
January 2014,what a fantastic birthday,The best ever experience of staying in a hotel.  I had told the team that it was my birthday when I booked and filled in the pre stay preferences.  On arriving I had been triple upgraded to one of the master suites and there was a birthday cake and card awaiting plus the champagne and flowers i had booked with their get more from your stay deal.  The staff couldn't have been more helpful and the suite was beautiful.  From the Penhaligon Toiletries to the canapes delivered to our room each evening the little touches were lovely. The Breakfasts were beautifully cooked and my request for eggs florentine not a problem We stayed for afternoon tea with my niece and they were just as happy to provide soy milk for her. The cakes and scones were plentiful and necessitated a take away…
January 2014,Unrivalled service,"The Milestone hotel has to be noted as one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in in the UK, and we have stayed in some of the countries finest.  The service has been unbelievably good and the room, sumptuous with the most amazing attention to detail. Well located with lovely views. A truly  memorable stay, thank you,  and absolutely no hesitation in recommending to others. We look forward to our next visit."
June 2013,The Best,Everything about our experience at The Milestone was excellent. The service was courteous and the facility was immaculate. We spent a lot of time in the conservatory and found it to be very comfortable and memorable. The location is excellent. 
November 2013,So much fun at the Milestone,"I guess one should able to take is as given, in a luxury hotel, that the staff will genuinely see it as their job to keep the guests happy: it's only when you visit somewhere like the Milestone that you realise how rare this is. We stayed here for a couple of nights on a big birthday and it felt as though all the staff were just waiting to make it special: their welcome was genuine and charming, and we had the best combination of being indulged and feeling at home. Our room (Mistinguette/art deco) was great fun and, even in November, it was fabulous to have the little balcony to stroll out onto. Everything - the champagne on arrival, turndown with roses and candles, scrumptious smoked haddock breakfasts and supper-a-deux (thank you, Florent, for making this so welcoming) - all…"
July 2013,The Fiona Duncan Review,"The Milestone is a most wonderful hotel, I don't know where Fiona Duncan was coming from in her review. The staff and the hotel are brilliant. If you are a guest there you are made to feel very special. Where else would the doorman be waiting for you, after walking all round Hyde Park in your walking kit, with bottles of water. It may be expensive but the Milestone has the best service that I have ever experienced. And, for over thirty years I stayed in some of the best hotels in the Far East."
December 2013,"Very cozy hotel, outstanding service","We're not usually big on boutique hotels but this one is exceptional. Service really sets them apart, and it is attentive and friendly from beginning to end. The decor is very traditionally British, but renovated and well-maintained throughout. We had been upgraded to a park view room, though the view was obscured by the lovely (from the outside) Christmas decorations. The staff is terrific, and addresses you by name very quickly. The food at Chennestons is wonderful, and there are a number of other restaurants easily accessible nearby.  If you're visiting London for the first time keep in mind that while the Milestone is convenient to Albert Hall, Kensington Gardens and Knightsbridge, it is not as walkable to the big sites in Westminster as the hotels in that Park Lane area.…"
December 2013,Quintessential English at its best,"We were lucky enough to have our wedding reception at the Milestone three years ago.  Last night we were even luckier to stay the night.  We had the Kensington Palace room, appropriately overlooking Kensington Gardens and onto the Palace.  The room was walled silk, thick damask type eiderdown, fluffy duvet, penhaglion toiletries, fruit and complimentary biscuits.  Knowing it was our wedding anniversary, they complemented all the above with congratulation cards, a bottle of champagne, strawberries dipped in chocolate and the final icing on the cake was returning to the room after dinner to find we had suddenly arrived in candle-land.  What seemed like hundreds of candles decorating the room, with equally hundreds of rose petals adorning the bed, and leading to the bathroom. …"
November 2013,Excellent Stay,"We stayed 3 nights (3 for the price of 2) for our wedding anniversary and we were luckily upgraded to a 2-bed apartment.  We splurged and arranged for the Bentley to collect us from the airport.  Enjoyed our welcome glass of bubbles in the saddle bar and then later in the evening had dinner at their signature restaurant. It is a charming quintessential British boutique hotel and the service is very good.  Great location for the Albert Hall, Knightsbridge and Hyde Park. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
November 2013,Lives up to the hype,"My wife and I stayed at The Milestone on the last weekend of November 2013 as a celebration for her birthday. I had read so many excellent reviews beforehand I had to wonder if The Milestone was really that good. In short, yes it is. The staff and their attention to detail are really what sets this place apart. Also special touches such as a complimentary glass of champagne each on arrival and balloons and a delicious birthday cake. The final crowning glory was the afternoon tea. As usual the service was impeccable and the food superb."
December 2013,our new 'home' when in london,"my 10 year old son and i just stayed two nights at the milestone (dec 2013).  what a great experience!  from the very beginning when i first emailed the hotel to our departure, the hotel was excellent.  I've stayed in many fine hotels around europe and the u.s., the milestone is amongst the very best.  they corresponded via email before our trip to ensure that both my son and i had the things we would need; helped us to find fun and enjoyable activities while at the hotel, and made sure we had a great room and all the wonderful service.    we enjoyed walking about london and taking the tube.  after all day sight seeing, we were rather tired so we had room service.  they have good food that even my picky eater son liked - chicken sticks, french fries, and ice cream.  speaking of…"
November 2013,A Wonderful Time,"My wife and I joined four other couples for a three nights stay at the Milestone. We arrived at 7:00am after a cross atlantic flight to find that our room was ready; no issues with an early check in or anything like that. We had breakfast at the hotel on two occaisions and had cocktails at the Stable bar. The hotel is located just a few minutes from the Kensington High Street Tube Stop and close to many of the more popular sites in London. Everyone at the hotel was always available to answer questions and help when needed. If I had one (small) complaint, I would say that the showers are very small and don't make it easy for a 6'2 man to comfortably shower.  If and when we come back to London, we will stay at this hotel.  It really was a wonderful experience and a first class…"
November 2013,Exceptional!,"I've stayed in many, many hotels - but I've never seen the attention to detail and care shown by the staff and management of The Milestone. The rooms are beautifully decorated, there are dozens of thoughtful little extras that the hotel does for the guests. The restaurant is superb and the gym and pool and more than adequate. I happily recommend The Milestone as one of the best (if not THE best) hotels I've ever stayed at."
October 2013,Lovely Mother-Daughter Weekend,"I LOVED the Milestone Hotel. It is right in Chelsea across from Kensington Palace. I have been to London many times and therefore did not need to be in the hub of London, making this a wonderful, quiet location. It is still within walking distance of so much, and is really quite peaceful. The hotel itself is clean, and the decor is classically British. I felt like a queen at the hotel. The rooms were beautiful, and the bathroom was fantastic. It was such  lovely atmosphere for a mother daughter weekend getaway.   The breakfast in the morning was delicious. The room it is in is beautiful as well. Overall, I think the grand decor of the hotel completely won me over."
September 2013,Best Afternoon Tea Period!,"If you're looking for a very special experience, look no further. We booked in advance and told them we were veggies and they catered specially for us. Chocolate scones and some of the most incredible cucumber sarnies I've ever had. Yum yum yum!"
September 2013,Great!!!!,"I was very astounded by the level of service in which the staff provides first to state, I do not usually write reviews but I definitely had to make a contribution here. I love love this hotel and will be back guaranteed. I actually live in London so I had no need to stay here but some friends decided to do something different and I joined them and I must say. It was worth it!"
October 2013,First Class all the way.,"My Wife and I stayed here for a number of days in early October and enjoyed it immensely. Everything was excellent and well maintained. Ambience was opulent and classy. Our room was comfortable and tastefully decorated, although small for the furnishing level. Even though facing a fairly busy street, room noise level was negligible. (third floor). Public rooms were smaller but cosy. We especially enjoyed the pub, ending a couple of days relaxing and reading there. (I'm missing my Speckled Hen already!) Everything was immaculately clean. Overall the service was attentive, staff eager to help.  The check in process and greetings on arrival were flawless.  The extras were frequent and thoughtful (Arrival champagne, greeting fruit and pastries, nightly candies, little gifts, rose…"
October 2013,"Best Hotel in the World, not just London!",The best hotel I have ever stayed in!  The service was FIRST CLASS.  The rooms extremely beautifully done as well as spotless and clean.  I felt like a superstar staying there and cant wait to go back.  I agree with all the other 5 star comments on here!... Just book it.. you will love it!
October 2013,Most Amazing Hotel Experience,"Although some might consider this a ""small"" hotel it is ""big"" on uts focus on service and care of their customers.   From the comfort and amenities in the rooms to the range of dining options this is a hotel experience I will return to again and again."
September 2013,Beautiful historic hotel in a great neighborhood,"We stayed at the Milestone hotel and had a wonder stay.  The hotel is located right across from the Kensington park and it is only about 10 mins walk to the Tube.  The hotel is wonderful, with awesome service.  All the staff are super friendly and very helpful.  Breakfast is fabulous.  I would definitely stay there again!"
September 2013,Oasis of Serenity,If you want to experience London but still want to be able to find some peace and serenity when returning to your hotel for the evening then stay at the Milestone Hotel. A five star hotel where everyone knows your name. From the doorman to the baggage handlers to concierge to the front desk all have a smile and friendly hello each and every time they see you. The Butlers make a point to make you feel at home as you check in to your room and cannot do enough to make you comfortable. I have stayed at other hotels in London but this will be my home away from home when in London. A warm and cozy atmosphere whether dining or just having a drink at the bar ..it is a wonderful experience. Located just across from Kensington Park the hotel is away from the hustle and bustle  yet one can…
June 2013,Nice hotel,"Enjoyed staying here.  The service was great, as was the value.  I also had a great night sleep - very well rested.  My favourite aspect of the hotel though is the location - it's hard to beat being in the center of Kensington.  I'd recommend this to any couples out there looking for a romantic weekend in central London."
September 2013,Excellent Hotel,"I happened on this Hotel by accident (my reservations having gotten screwed up) and I am glad that I did stumble across this place. This was, I think, in every way a superior Hotel to where I was supposed to stay. The staff were wonderfully helpful and friendly. The building and rooms were beautifully decorated and the bed was very comfy!"
October 2013,Passionate hospitality,"We recently stayed at The Milestone in London a Carnation Group hotel.  It was just lovely. The rooms are superbly decorated and the restaurant for breakfast/dinner superb.  The hotel is opposite Kensington Palace and is a really excellent location.  I was meeting a friend I hadn't seen for many years and although the hotel didn't actually serve lunch on Saturdays (afternoon tea only) when I mentioned this they actually did lunch just for us (four persons total) - that is amazing and the food was wonderful.  The staff, all of them, very helpful and professional. This is one of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in and I travel frequently. I made use of the in-house beautician and she was also excellent."
October 2013,Outstanding hotel and service,"We stayed last week for an anniversary treat and we would both say this hotel is hard to beat.  The staff were excellent, friendly, professional and enthusiastic.  The Milestone had decided to upgrade us and the room was spotless, beautifully decorated and with all kinds of extras.  We were touched to return from our meal out to find the room beautifully lit with candles and anniversary gifts.  Definitely a very special hotel to which we hope to return.Thank you to all at the Milestone."
September 2013,Simply outstanding,We spent 4 days in London on the way to Paris and a D-Day tour of Normandy. Several people recommended The Milestone as their favorite hotel in London. Good advice. I would describe it as a 5 star boutique hotel. It is adjacent to Kensington Park and Kensington Palace as well as Whole Foods of London (which is also worth a visit). The tube is nearby and there are always cabs awaiting. The hotel also has a Rolls Royce available.  The staff was very attentive and solicitous and actually addressed guests by memorizing their names. We had a spacious sunny corner suite... The hotel is small and luxurious and very British.
August 2013,A great place to stay,"I had an appointment in London at the end of August, so we decided to combine business with some shopping and sightseeing and stay somewhere really special. We decided to try the Milestone Hotel after seeing the excellent reviews on Trip Adviser. We were not disappointed. We were checked in by Neil, the Front of House Manager. He was friendly and efficient and quickly made us feel very welcomed. After a quick tour of the hotel, we were then shown up to our room. We stayed in the English Rose room. This room was a good size, beautifully decorated, and had glorious views over Kensington Gardens. The bathroom also had a luxurious feel and looked especially nice at night with soft lighting and candles. There were fresh flower arrangements in the bedroom and bathroom too. We also…"
September 2013,Expectations Met,"From the moment we arrived we were greeted like we were returning to our home. The staff of this property are both extremely friendly, yet professional. Our junior suite was spacious by London standards and was a nice mix of modern with traditional amenities. The hotel's bar was cozy and fun. We looked forward to returning for drinks at the end of each day. Breakfast and afternoon tea were outstanding. Tourist sights were easy to get to by either the Tube or the hop on/off bus tour, but we preferred actually staying in the lovely Kensington neighborhood. The Milestone Hotel was the perfect choice for our time in London and we will be back!"
September 2013,"NO REQUEST IS TOO LARGE, NO DETAIL TOO SMALL",The payoff of the hotel perfectly fits the extraordinary experience of staying at the Milestone. I absolutely loved dining at the Cheneston's and I want to thank everybody for making my staying in London simply unforgettable! I
September 2013,Service is key here,"Although the Milestone was not close to anything we were in London to see, it was a quick ""tube"" ride to anywhere we were headed.  Other than having to wait to check in, the service in this hotel was amazing.  From the concierge Jose', to the amazing bartender and including the ""always there"" Julie, the service was impeccable.  For my birthday, I came back to the room that night to find a birthday cake, rose petals on the bed and in the bathtub and lit floating candles in glass vases everywhere.  It was beautiful.  We had a great view of Kensington Park and everytime we left the property the bellman was friendly, calling us by name, and helpful. There were quite a few people staying there that make the Milestone a yearly visit. The keyword for this hotel is ""Service"""
March 2013,Just great,"This beautiful hotel in Kensington has such an excellent service. One is greeted with a personal touch and you feel very welcome. The breakfast is the best I can remember, I wish I could eat there every morning....   The bar has excellent cocktails, beware of the Vesper cocktail, It kicks like a mule...  Our room was beautiful, quiet and extremely comfortable.  The location of the hotel is very good, we took the tube every time as this was very easy to get around London."
October 2013,Fantastic,"Nothing about the hotel is worth a negative word.  Just excellent.  A little problem with the concierge advance help.  The Guidelines of Britain tour was 400 pounds and did not know the daily W. Abbey schedule so it was closed and we mostly just drove around in circles.  Guide was dry and monotone, did OK with the Changing of the Guard viewing.  Also, we paid for Big Bus tickets and they were never delivered.  Did not use them since we had to go to the Abbey the next day on our own.  Still, they might have delivered the tickets to us or at least asked about them?"
September 2013,As Good as Everyone Says,"We stayed at the Milestone in September as a celebration for my husband's birthday.  When we arrived at the hotel in our taxi, the bellman greeted us by name.   From the moment we entered the hotel, until we left, attention was given by the Milestone staff to make our stay as enjoyable as possible.  We regret that we could only stay one night.    We had the African room which was cozy, elegant and comfortable.  Perhaps it is the furnishings and lighting that make it so  extraordinary.  We have stayed in 5 star hotels before, but this one is at the top of our list.  The location is right by Kensington Gardens which is beautiful.  It is a 5 minute walk to the underground that is very easy to navigate.  If you want to splurge and stay somewhere really nice, look no further than The…"
September 2013,Absolutely lovely,"Booked this hotel based on tripadvisor reviews. It truly was a beautiful place to stay. The room we had was scrumptious. That added to all the little touches: hand written welcome note; cookies on arrival, chocs with turn down service; complimentary water; and so many towels and gowns we didn't know what to do with. The room was scrupulously clean. Service from all staff - impeccable. The hotel is located very close to High St Kensington tube station making it easy to get into the city but it's a ""nice"" area of London to come back to. Good shops and restaurants. We especially enjoyed being able to walk in Kensington Gardens (just across the road) after breakfast before heading out to hit the sights."
September 2013,Simply amazing,It was a real treat and a once a year splash for three nights in London recently with my partner. We chose The Milestone and we were not disappointed.  Attention to detail and all staff superbly attentive but no overkill. Special mention to Steve who is essentially the first person you meet when you pull up (in a taxi in our case). Great 'frontman' for the hotel. Very comfortable beds and suffice to say every need catered for in the well maintained rooms. Public areas a quality peaceful experience.  Thanks to all staff at The Milestone
September 2013,"Milestone Hotel,  London, England",My husband and I spent 2 nights. Best small hotel we ever stayed in. Beautiful and very comfortable.  Staff excellent gave attention to all our needs. Location is perfect for getting around London.  When they heard we were celebrating our anniversary they surprised us with a special night in our room with rose petals.  I was so surprised when we returned from a dinner out and walked into our rose covered room.  This was a truly a special gift.
November 2012,Wonderful & Peaceful Afternoon Tea,"My husband and I just enjoyed a wonderful tea session at the Milestone. I chose The Milestone because I wanted to relax and enjoy my tea in a quite & cozy environment (vs.the hustle, bustle and impersonal service of some of the larger establishments). The Milestone suited our needs perfectly. The interior design was tastefully and elegantly decorated in a Victorian library motif and the limited number of seating provided the intimate air that I absolutely adored. The sandwiches, pastries and scones were plentiful and varied. The service was impeccable, very polite and unhurried. I cannot say enough about this hidden gem of a place and would recommend it to anyone looking to experience a delightfully delicious and relaxing tea service!"
May 2013,The Palace May Be Across the Park But The Royal Treatment is Here,"It has been two days since we closed the door on Room 308 at The Milestone and made our way back to the US. I like to think a style of living in that Regency Suite for a few days will stay with us for a long time. My husband and I checked in to The Milestone as a base for our first visit to The Royal Horticulture Society's Chelsea Garden Show. Being escorted up the steps of that grand old red brick building and crossing the threshold into the small sophisticated lobby, we knew we had entered a new world of old values--one of courtesy, respect, consideration, duty and etiquette. The art of civility is not lost, it can be found 24/7 at The Milestone. The palace may be across the park but the royal treatment is here. Time seemed to slow down inside those lovely old front doors.…"
May 2013,Good old fashioned service.,"From the moment you arrive you can expect and will receive first class service. The building , location , staff and food are great. We have just visited for a second time and found it to be even better than our last visit.We will certainly go again."
February 2013,First class hotel,"My husband and I have stayed at The Milestone three times and we now consider it our favourite hotel in London. The friendly staff make you feel very welcome and nothing is ever too much trouble.They always remember what pillows we prefer, what newspaper we read and the names of our children! Afternoon tea served in The Park Lounge is a real treat. Its elegant architecture,  beautifully designed rooms along with attention to detail and courteous staff make it a very special hotel."
April 2013,wonderfull fantastic splendid hotel...,my partner and i have just returned from this fine establishment on business the staff here made our stay very special indeed Immaculately clean friendly staff glorious food great location very very special i would like to thank every member of staff for making our stay so warm and relaxed
May 2013,"Wonderful hotel, thoughtful service","The Milestone is a lovely hotel - beautiful accommodation and thoughtful service without any stuffiness. My partner and I stayed for a business trip combined with a birthday celebration, and the staff at the Milestone made our stay very special. They were so welcoming and courteous that we relaxed immediately.  Our room was exquisitely decorated and spotless, with a wonderful view of the park. I don't always sleep well when travelling, but not a problem here - the bed was exceptionally comfortable with gorgeous linens. This is a true gem, looking forward to our next visit."
April 2013,"Wonderful, splendid, stylish hotel with great staff","J spent two fantastic days with my wife in this marvelous, very beautiful hotel. We extremely enjoyed the time in an unique suite with a four poster bed and very beautiful antique furniture including Victorian windows and the viws towards Kensington Gardens and Palace. Many thanks to Angelina and Fraj. They were very friendly and helpful! The public area inside the Hotel  is also very special and beautiful. Everything is perfect including all details. We really highly recommend this wonderful Milestone Hotel and we already look forward to come back soon."
April 2013,Unique hotel,"My friend and I recently spent a wonderful night at this beautiful hotel.  Immaculately clean, friendly staff, delicious food.  Ideal location with views of Kensington Palace and very close to the Royal Albert Hall, only took us 10 minutes to walk to this venue for a show."
May 2013,A True Oasis,The Milestone Hotel is a truly unique and special experience. We were return guests and were ever more pleased by this fantastic and friendly hotel. The hotel itself is a beautifully designed property with stunning views over Kensington Palace and the grounds. Each room is a uniquely designed home away from home.  The Stables Bar is a real treat as is the Library and Chenestons Restaurant.  Most importantly the service at this hotel is incomparable.  You are treated royally from the first hello to the last goodbye.  A true 5 star hotel in every way!
May 2013,excellent stay,had a wonderful stay at this hotel as usual. Every time time in London I stay there for several reasons: - excellent location - you not only enjoy the views of Hyde Park and Kensington Palace but also enjoy comfortable sorrundins of Kensington High and Noting Hill - traditional english interior - although I like more modern hotels it is not the case for the Milestone English tradition is just as it should be not too much - excllent service and staff - peple working in the hotel know you in person and always do their best to make you feel as confortable as possible - I have even received a birthday cake for my birthday))  Highly recommended!!!!
April 2013,Excellent Service on a Business Trip,"I had the pleasure of staying at The Milestone for two evenings while in London on business. When I arrived from the States, as promised, my room was ready for me to freshen up. I had an unplanned business breakfast the next morning and the service was professional and very accommodating. I was greeted by name each time I entered and exited and my room had a fantastic view of the park. The exercise room was clean and had all of the equipment one would expect. Overall I had a wonderful experience and would highly recommend the hotel for any traveler who values the boutique experience."
March 2013,A special treat,"My wife and i spent 5 days at this remarkable boutique hotel in March.The experience was so wonderful,that we decided to come back in October,bringing our daughter and son in law with us. We felt pumpered, accomodated,and being taken care of , in any form.Cozy,beautiful,elegant with an emphasis on details in every area and aspect.Well furnished rooms,modern bathooms and very comfortable beds.Well train personnel,eager to assist you,exceptional breakfast with remarkable service,and night time piano as you enjoy your tea.7 minutes away,from the train station,and right across the street from Hide Park.The area is full of different restaurants, and we discovered a little jewel 1-2 blocks away (Cote Bistro),very busy place.Well,i can't wait to return and feel once more like a…"
April 2013,Beautiful and Elegant Boutique hotel,"Wonderfully elegant boutique hotel, located directly across from Kennsington Palace. This hotel really has it all to offer. Fantastic service, indoor pool, fitness center, great food and the most beautiful/comfy rooms. The staff was extrememly attentive, kinda felt like royalty myself! Enjoyed their famous Afternoon tea. The tea was lovely and the food was amazing! I also tried, dinner and breakfast. All very good and tasty. Overall the staffs goal was to see that I was pleased with my stay the whole time I was there and they definitely achieved that. If you like smaller/boutique hotels rather then a larger 5 star hotels, this is the place to stay while in London. Great location to shopping, the Underground, museums and Kennsington Palace."
April 2013,Fabulous Hotel--Wonderful Service!,"My husband and I travel to Europe every year and we either fly into or out of London. We've stayed in quite a few nice hotels in London,but we must say that the Milestone is ""over the top""!  From the moment we walked in, everything was perfect---well not everything--the heat went out in our room the day before we left! But no problem! Stephanie, Alexa and Fran saw to it that we were moved to a beautiful suite for the time remaining. They packed up everything and placed it in the new room. We already had plans for dinner with friends that evening, but Stephanie insisted that we be treated to a beautiful appetizer tray and drinks in the bar beforehand! The  entire staff was most hospitable and welcoming. Jose made reservations for us at a restaurant that we wanted to try but had…"
January 2013,You will genuinely feel welcome here,"The two of us spent a wonderful New Years holiday here.  We gave the travel agent two requirements for a hotel for our four night stay in London--a proper bar and near a tube station.  While the tube stop was near, it was closed for maintenance over the holiday.  The bus stopped just down the block, so this was not an issue.  The bar and the bartenders were warm and funny! We enjoyed our nightcaps each evening.  While those were our only two requirements, we got everything we could have imagined in our stay.  We received an email in advance of our stay asking for our preferences on everything from our preferred drink on arrival--champagne and an English ale were poured while we checked in--to linen and music choices for the iPod!  Without exception, every employee seemed to…"
April 2013,Another wonderful stay,"There is a joy to returning to a smallish, service oriented hotel.  To be rememberd by those who were there the last time you were and within hours by the new additions brings a feeling fo being a person and not a number.Every wish is immediately met with- of course we can do that and then it is done."
April 2013,Milestone Exceeds Anyone's Expectations,"As a travel professional, I note every nuance of a hotel, from its service staff to ambiance to customer service. London is abundant with top-tier hotels but none of them rises as high as The Milestone does. I spent four nights/five days on this trip to London; I last stayed at The Milestone two years ago. Truly, I can't imagine ""improving"" this property. It's perfect. Located across the street from Kensington Palace and Gardens, The Milestone is in a non-touristy area. Close-by is a huge Whole Foods and an Underground station which also houses a large Marks & Spencer.  Staff goes out of its way to provide customized assistance .... the concierges went way beyond play tickets. They called sister properties and communicated with them to ensure we had tickets to the…"
October 2012,Fabulous Hotel!,"I've been remiss in not writing about my stay here.  Visited our daughter in London while enroute to Europe on business.  The Milestone, across from Hyde Park, was conveniently located to her quarters, making it a good choice based on location.  Little did we know the treat that we were in for. The room was large with a great view of the park and all the amenities one would expect from a great hotel.  It is the staff here, however, that help to distinguish this hotel from its competitors. We couldn't say enough about how friendly and helpful each and every staff member was.  I've stayed at a lot of great hotels in London, but this is clearly my favorite."
April 2013,Great place to stay,"We stayed at the Milestone recently to celebrate my husband's birthday.  We had been staying in a different area of London for 5 nights before staying at the milestone & had a very hectic week so were ready to relax & enjoy his birthday.  The decor is traditional & there are some lovely original features in the hotel. The service was excellent as was the food, the extra special touches & attention to detail is what makes this hotel a great place to stay.  Upon check in we were given an upgrade which was much appreciated & Fran showed us round the hotel.  He was extremely helpful, knowledgable & friendly as were all the staff. The room was lovely as was the bathroom with plenty of nice touches, the only thing that wasn't perfect was the picture on the TV but as we didn't really…"
April 2013,Beyond my expectations,"Everything about this stay (my third) was excellent, if I could have given a higher score than 10/10 for this weekend it would be thoroughly deserved. Special thanks to Pedro who showed us a lot of rooms (I loved the Safari Room) and also to Augustine who served us our evening meal and was really informative about everything. Also, must not forget Marcus, that man has a fantastic memory, remembered we didn't come back for a cocktail on our last stay, he made me a delicious Ameretto sour. All the staff are friendly and approachable which you do not get in the larger hotels. We even tried the resistance pool this time which was an experience. We had breakfast in our room and in the restaurant which was perfect and an evening meal. Hopefully be back sometime soon."
January 2013,Brilliant!!!,"Upon checking in this perfectly British ""boutique"" hotel we were treated like royalty. The entire staff at the hotel were amazing and extremely hospitable.  The hotel bar is a fantastic place to have a cocktail prior to venturing out for the evening and when we returned our bartender welcomed us back by our names. This bar was a fantastic place to relax and talk with friends.  The dining room was elegant and the breakfast was superb. Although I did not opt for the healthier options - the waffle was a slice of heaven - a little bit like dessert for breakfast.  The room was perfect and the artwork on the wall was superb.  After forgetting to take off the do not disturb sign - so housekeeping did not clean our room while we were gone - we were greeted with a note that stated…"
May 2012,Great experience at Milestone Hotel!,"My wife and I stayed at the Milestone hotel for my 30th birthday.  From the moment we checked in until our departure the next afternoon, we were overwhelmed by the superb service from the staff at the hotel.    Upon check in, two managers welcomed me, wished me a happy birthday and upgraded our room from a standard category to one of their themed suites free of charge.  The decor in the room was a bit flamboyant but tastefully done - it was an homage to the late French entertainer Mistinguett who was once the highest paid actress/singer in her days.  The doorman at the hotel told me he wished he had tickets for the concert as well - since he was a big fan of Mark Knopfler also.  Nonetheless he wished me a great evening and asked me all about it on my return after the concert had…"
January 2013,It's the people who make it special,"My wife and I stay at the Milestone whenever we're in London. Having stayed at ""cheaper"" hotels in the Kensington area, we would walk by the Milestone and we'd always talk about ""someday, we're going to stay there.""  We finally did and never looked back.  The location of the hotel is perfect, close to restaurants of every type and price, just a couple of blocks from the High Street Kensington tube station, with shopping that ranges from food shops, higher-end chains to unique boutiques and antique shops.  The staff at the Milestone are the secret to its perfection, always searching for ways to improve their service. Yes, it's a most charming, intimate hotel, very quiet, warm and inviting. The hotel offers rooms you won't find elsewhere in London, each unique, beautiful,…"
January 2013,Favorite Hotel,The charm of the building is complemented by the competence and courtesy of the staff.  We spent a week that was both enjoyable and provied many opportunities for appreciating the best of British hospitality.
February 2012,Luxury at it's best,"I stayed at The Milestone Hotel just for one night. And i was very impressed. I have been working in luxury hotels for many years and generally know what to expect, but The Milestone Hotel absolutely exceeded my expectations.  First just when you walk in to the hotel, it seems you have entered a peaceful oasis, it was the first wow factor. It does not feel At all that the hotel is located on one of the busiest west London streets! I like small, intimate boutique hotels and Milestone thicks all boxes. I stayed in one of the studio suites with a stunning view over Kensington Gardens! Room was beautifully decorated, i especially liked the bathroom. It was good size and absolute luxury.  All in all can' t say enough about this amazing hotel they deserve to be Nr.1 on Tripadvisor!"
September 2012,The Milestone is doing everything right,"I was delighted to see The Milestone's recent inclusion in Tripadvisor's top 25 hotels in the world. From our experience, this beautiful boutique hotel deserves all the accolades it is getting. My husband and I, and two small dogs, stayed at the Milestone in September during our relocation to London. We were charmed from the outset, and every aspect of the hotel -- the cozy, comfortable bar, the gracious reception and dining rooms, the attentive service, and signature room details, only enhanced our sense of being ""home.""  Since then, we've stayed at two other Red Carnation properties, the Summer Lodge, and the Old Government House on Guernsey: both are superb.  Not many hotels make you feel this at ease, and eager to return, as the Milestone does."
February 2012,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here a couple of years ago for a few days.It was a lovely hotel,nice and small and friendly. Very expensive though.It was in a nice spot near the park.the service could not be faulted,but the room was very small with not a good outlook."
November 2012,Lovely British and top class in all performance.,The Milestone has  no tolerance making  ANY errors. They have excellent service and very friendly reception. Food and wine together with breakfast and don't forget the bar - high class! But nothing compared with the beds!! You will never get out of it lit's a lovely sleeping!
January 2013,Wonderful Experience,"The Milestone is the perfect blend of old English atmosphere with the modern amenities. The staff makes you  experience truly great service. Visited the promenade for afternoon tea, which was a real treat. The best afternoon tea ever. If your looking for 100% service then this is the place. Luxurious furnishings and attentive staff make a weekend stay feel unforgettable.  The rooms are so comfortable and the hotel smells of fresh flowers with the hint of polished wood."
November 2012,Great Hotel except the restaurant,"The Milestone Hotel is a little gem in Kensington, service is warm and personal, public areas are full of character and charm (specially the polo bar and the afternoon tea living room); and rooms are adequate.  Location is great right on Kensington Court and in front of kensington palace and gardens.  Our stay was full of nice little details from the staff, they make you feel at home and tend to your every need with a smile. would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants great attention to detail.  My only complaint is the service at the restaurant, for breakfast we had a couple of bad experiences with extremely slow service as well as the waiters giving tables to other guests that had come in after we were already waiting for a table of the same size. We finally gave up and…"
December 2012,A Wonderful Hotel,"We were a family group of ten, so not the easiest crowd to control; they managed us to perfection.  We stayed only one night but left feeling that we were parting from good friends, such was the kindliness of the staff.  Our room - probably one of the lowlier ones in the hotel - was exquisite.  We were treated like royalty, notwithstanding the numerous problems we dumped on them to resolve.  I suspect we will all be going back - in groups and en bloc - as soon as we have half an excuse to do so.  What a lovely place to stay!"
December 2012,UTOPIA,"Wonderful staff and location.  Everyone was so accomodating and friendly making the whole experience fabulous!  I will definitely return!  The facilities for accompanying pets are worth a browse too!!  The room was very comfortable with everything catered for -  luxury products and many extras.  If you are having the afternoon tea do not eat lunch beforehand!!  It is a marathon of delicious sandwiches, cakes and a cream tea!"
December 2012,Excellent hotel in London,"This small hotel is only a 10 minute walk from the Albert Hall.  All the staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble. The small restaurant serves excellent food, there is a lovely cosy lounge with a fire.  Bedrooms are fairly small but beautifully appointed.  I would definitely recommend a stay here."
October 2012,Great location,"I stayed at this hotel when I got stuck in London due to Hurricane Sandy in NYC.  It was a cute charming hotel.  It is right across the street from Hyde Park and I had a great view of it from my room.  It is also walking distance to Kensington Palace and Kensington High Street.  There is some food shopping just down the way and a Whole Foods, the first I have ever seen in London.  The room was nice.  I liked that the remote control for the tv was wrapped in plastic stating that it had been sterilized.  If only all hotels did that.  The afternoon tea was wonderful, but you need more than one person for it.  Most of the staff was friendly.  One of the concierge was not happy when I wanted to book a cab through Addison Lee.  He got very frustrated when trying to book and it showed.…"
November 2012,Best services ever!,"We stayed here for 3 nights for our honeymoon and were given the best services we have ever received out of all the hotels we have stayed around the world.  Everyone was extremely considerate, involving and warm, while upholding traditional English courtesy and respect. We felt very welcome and had received daily small gifts every time we returned to the hotel.  We are usually rather pedantic however felt overwhelmed by the true English hospitality offered by the truly wonderful staff of Milestone Hotel, London. We never stay at the Same hotel twice but would return to Milestone for our next London trip. You have surpassed our expectation in almost every way!   A big thanks to:  Teddy the bellboy,  Stephanie, Georgia in reception Fran the butler  Alex the concierge Grant the F&B…"
December 2012,Always 'home from home',"I stayed at The Milestone again last week, Christmas shopping with my niece. After a sumptuous lunch in their cosy lounge we headed for the shops.  When we got back it was champagne all the way!  Neil was, as ever, so welcoming. The new F&B Manager, Fabrizio, is a credit to the hotel.  Dinner in the evening was again out of this world.  The scallops to start were exceptionally well presented and tasty. My Venison with was pink, tender and perfect. My niece had the Kensington Pasty, WOW! who thought a 'pasty' could be this good (yes, I sneaked a taste).  I never tire of The Milestone and will be back in the New Year with my Mother. Can't wait!"
December 2012,Great experience!,"I was so glad that I've choosen this hotel for my short trip to London. I was staying on my own on December 2011 ( sorry guys. I know this is a little late to write but wanted to share my experience) to take care some staff for my family. Being away from my family and boyfiend during Christmas time, I was not so excited to be in London alone. That was changed after entering this hotel. When I arrived, I was greeted warmly and got all the assistance needed. They also put nice Christmas tree in my room. Everyone was so kind and the service was very personal. I felt at home and felt warm. One of the best experience at hotel for sure. Thank you!"
October 2012,Amazing,My mother and I stayed here for three nights. The service was fantastic; they went above and beyond helping us in so many ways. The location is perfect. Every village we wanted to visit was close.   ~Julie
December 2012,Old English class and style,"My family stayed at the Milestone for my mother's 80th birthday, it was the perfect choice. The reception staff and doorman were impeccable, curteous and helpful without being overbearing. The rooms were compact, but plenty big enough and the bathrooms were well appointed with a good size bath and excellent shower in one unit.  Make sure you visit the bar while you are there and chat to the excellent staff, I spent a very enjoyable evening talking to the barman and a guest from Boston as we tried to decipher the rules of cricket. The dinner to celebrate my mother's birthday was excellent. The food was superb and the wine list, although it has plenty of wines that cost more than my first car, also contains plenty of good affordable wines. Make sure you include breakfast with your…"
December 2012,My second stay,"Hotel is still one of the nicest I have stayed in and so glad they had their Christmas decorations up as stayed in the Springtime before. Unfortunately some things were a bit disappointing and just felt the attention to detail was missing in some areas. We had completed the preference form prior to arriving so couldn't understand why the fruit platter had only one of the fruits we asked for on it, did we get one meant for someone else? The evening meal was booked fo 7.p.m. on our preference form but the confirmation when it came was booked for 5.30.p.m. My friend had to contact the hotel to point out this error so we then received further confirmation for 7.30 p.m. which we decided to leave it at this time as it was only 30 minutes difference. We duly arrived at 7.30.p.m. and…"
November 2012,Once in a lifetime,"My husband and I and a friend stayed for 10 days in a two bedroom apartment at The Milestone in November/December.   We enjoy the 'good things in life', but this far surpassed that. From the wonderful driver who picked us up at the airport, the several pleasant and friendly doormen, the happy and cheerful concierges, to Fran, the butler, who gave new meaning to the well deserved word 'awesome',  an overused word which I would normally try to avoid at all costs - they made our stay a memorable one which probably won't be repeated again soon.     The apartment was resplendent with beautiful furniture, opulent draperies and bedding, beautiful bath amenities, well appointed kitchen - well, I could go on and on.   Coming home in the evenings after a full day of enjoying London,  the…"
October 2012,Great place to stay with family,"Great place to visit over weekend break. Nice relaxing place, great comfortable rooms and friendly staff. Children were very happy and feel that they are very welcome by staff  who was very friendly and accomodated. Enjoyed! thank you"
December 2012,Wonderful Christmas,"Stayed in one of the apartments over Christmas and also enjoyed lovely breakfasts each morning, the Christmas dinner, and a tea.  All were wonderful!  Our family loved the space and convenience, plus it was only 5 minutes walk to the Tube and Whole foods.  Many nice restaurants in walking distance, and the staff was superb at giving suggestions on where to go and eat.  We avoid the tourist traps at all costs.    Our apartment was so clean and comfortable, and the beds felt so good after a day of sightseeing. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone."
December 2012,The Milestone a hotel of charm,"I have stayed at the milestone before and the first time it was cosy and cute. My first room was a savile row design which was awesome! Different! Yet not too loud, this time we stayed at the Venetian suite and it was jut an absolute charm in Kensington.  To be honest I had different options of hotels but I wanted to stay here because the location is brilliant, it's a boutique hotel therefore you get treated like its your own home and this what I exactly wanted.  Anyway the stay was lovely, charming and nice, staff were responsive and attainable ( thank you ) What the hotel gives you is love and what it needs is a new kettle, probably a new iron and coffee+tea in the room."
June 2012,Best Night in London,"My husband and I still fondly recall our stay at The Milestone Hotel.  Our first couple of nights in the UK were spent at this lovely location and we couldn't have been happier.  It was wonderful to return every night to such a comfortable, welcoming place.  Staff members were superb.  We stayed in several other hotels during our travels and this hotel had the most genuinely amiable, efficient and knowledgeable staff.  The Milestone has excellent dining options, is located in a pleasant part of London - right across from Kensington Park, and our rooms were cozy, elegant and very well appointed.  In fact, we were so impressed with the hotel that we decided to stay there the last couple of days of our vacation.  If you would like a gracious and truly memorable stay in London I…"
November 2012,Absolutely wonderful (with just a few minor complaints),"The Milestone Hotel was a wonderful experience - beautifully decorated rooms with incredibly professional staff that tried to go the extra mile to make our experience special. The hotel was fairly conveniently located in High Kensington, and also fairly affordable (after discounts). I would definitely recommend this hotel for special occasions, as they definitely made ours more memorable.  +++: Service:  From the moment you check-in, the entire experience was exactly as many guests have previously espoused: incredible. From champagne and cake for the birthday celebration, to canapés in the evening, all staff were friendly, professional and helpful. The concierge was especially helpful with reservations and recommendations, and the doorman was delightfully cheery as always.  …"
December 2012,'Unforgettable stay in London',"I was lucky enough to stay at The MIlestone a couple of weeks ago with my mum and her friend and I can honestly say it was perfect from start to finish. Such a beautiful and luxurious boutique hotel, yet refined, cosy and unpretentious. The staff were a credit to the hotel, particularly the ladies on reception and the barmen at Stables Bar. Hope to return again soon!"
December 2012,High standards...with some blips,"The hotel were very keen guests should post a review onto Tripadvisor, so here goes. At this hotel level (that see themselves as the epitome of luxury, and for which one pays accordingly) it's attention to detail that its the ultimate judge of quality.More on this later. The style is very much 'country house' with lots of dark colours, wood panelling, chintz and so on. The rooms are on the small side (two guests wanting to watch TV means one will have to sit on the bed) but are richly furnished; the bathroom is substantial and luxuriously equipped. The lobby service is very good and attentive but I have one or two minor issues with the service. As I said, it's attention to detail that's all important. It seemed the majority of the staff serving were eastern European origin and…"
November 2012,Excellent Stay in London,"I spent a few nights at the Milestone Hotel in London, and I can say enough about the service, the style of the hotel, the convenience to getting around, and the friendly staff.  The breakfast was excellent, and the lovely parlor room with the roaring fire was so nice.  Every detail is complete in their rooms and the service that you receive.   In addition, they have a really cool resistance pool - it's a great way to exercise and unwind at the end of the day."
January 2012,Excellent stay!,"We stayed at The Milestone Hotel in December and our stay there was absolutely brilliant! During this stay, I asked my girlfriend to marry me. In the preparation for this occasion, I've probably exchanged over 20 e-mails with the hotel to make sure everything would be perfectly in order. They promised it would be excellent, and boy, did they deliver!  We booked the Mistinguett suite for two nights. Upon arrival, we were met by our butler who showed us around the hotel and the suite. 2 glasses of Champagne immediately appeared for us to enjoy.  I had made some specific requirements for the special occasion, and it seemed the entire hotel staff was into the plan. Even the ladies at the reception were very enthusiastic and when asking them a question (without my girlfriend nearby),…"
November 2012,My 3rd stay not to sure about a 4th,"My friend and myself stayed here for 2 nights and although I love this hotel I think there were little things that let it down.  On arrival our room wasn't quite ready and we were offered a glass of champagne while we waited which was a lovely touch. We sat in the bar area chatting to Markus who is lovely.  Our room was ready in about 10mins so up went to room 203 which was lovely, in fact so nice we spent most of our time there.  On checking our fruit platter they gave us the wrong fruit. Not a big problem but that have never happened before. We went down to have a pre dinner drink and the canapes that have been served in previous years have gone downhill. One bread stick between us and the tiny toasted sanwiches were quite greasy also we had nearly finished our drinks before…"
December 2012,So happy to be back at The Milestone!,"Nothing is finer than returning to The Milestone- especially during the festive season when it looks especially lovely.   My husband and I just took a vacation to Italy and we passed through London on both ends of the trip.    We stayed at the Milestone for a total of 5 nights and every night was superb.    No matter which suite you get, you will be thrilled.   They are all lovely and unique.    I'm quite convinced that the staff is the best in London (if not the world).  If I sound like I'm a little over the top about this hotel, it is because I am.    It is that good.     We also had dinner on two different nights at the hotel restaurant-- Chenestons.  It is also lovely and the food is a real treat.    The location across the street from Kensington Palace is my favorite spot…"
November 2012,Somehow we missed the personal touch,"Our overall experience at this hotel was positive and I would recommend it to anyone, particularly those interested in the Kensington area, but they do have some opportunities for improvement.  The pros include:  decor and overall charm, quality of linens and toiletries, excellent tea, location in Kensington.  Unfortunately the concierge was less than helpful.  I asked for some inside information on visiting Westminster Abbey and was quoted the hours of operation.  The breakfast was average.  Although lovely our deluxe king room was quite compact with a very small window; however, the bathroom was large.  I was irritated because there was a planned disruption to the tube lines that service the hotel as well as a protest near the hotel on the Saturday that we were there.  Most…"
November 2012,Delicious afternoon tea,"Afternoon tea is such an elegant way of spending your (rainy) afternoon, especially when done in such a lovely decor as in the Milestone. We'd made reservations well in advance and requested to be seated near the fireplace. We did get these seats and it is lovely, though quite warm. Make sure you have something to take off if you request these seats. Next time, I'd ask to be seated under the 'Wimbledon painting'. You'll have to be in a group of four. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the three o'clock session ran late (the hotel has three 'rounds', each two hours). We were called in advance by the hotel informing us of this. They were very apologetic and I think they handled it superb. Staff was very friendly, service was excellent. Food was good. All in all a delightful and…"
October 2012,Beautiful Victorian Hotel with Impeccable Service,"We stayed at this hotel on Wednesday 31st October for one night. Firstly I have to say that usually when I book a hotel it never lives up to the expectation that I imagine, I have to say with this hotel it was exactly as I imagined and more.  We were greeted on arrival by Fran one of the butlers who kindly offered to show us around the hotel, the Victorian lounge was beautiful where the afternoon teas are served, the restaurant and bars were all so lovely and very impressive, creating a fine but cosy atmosphere. On arrival to our room we found we had been upgraded to a deluxe room which was lovely, as it was our wedding anniversary and this made it all very special. We booked this hotel as we were visiting the Royal Albert Hall to see Diana Krall, and I have to say this hotel is…"
November 2012,Brilliant!,"My daughter (9 years) and I were treated like queens.  I could not imagine a more comfortable, caring oasis in a busy city.  We loved London but we really loved coming ""home"" and seeing what personal touches awaited us in our room...one day a cake, another my child's name spelled out in letters on the bed, and some light snacks.  Speical marks to Dixon and Alexa for their kindnesses and personal attention."
November 2012,A milestone spent at the Milestone.,"After reading the very many favourable Trip Advisor reviews and the hotel's excellent & enticing web site I knew this was to be our base in central London for my wife's 50th birthday.  If one reads the hotel management's list of operational & service quality aspirations, for myself, one of the most significant is ; to attempt to exceed their customers expectations.The Milestone's happy and very attentive staff certainly achieve this goal. Particularly worthy of mention were the reception & door staff service levels, a very nice touch being the ability to remember customers names. Also, unusual, even for five star hotels, is the presence and availability of management which is obvious and transparent.  Firstly we were provided with an excellent initial tour from Alexa around the…"
November 2012,A home away from home,"This was the second time we stayed at The Milestone and quite simply, it is faultless. The warm service is what sets it apart from other 5-star hotels in London (and we have stayed at quite a few!). It feels like a home away from home --  everyone who works at the hotel goes out of their way to ensure that all your needs are met and are all genuinely accommodating and courteous. The interior feels like you are staying in a private English house and the atmosphere is just spectacularly cosy and intimate. Absolutely amazing -- THE place to stay in London."
November 2012,Fabulous stay :),"We recently stayed at The Milestone and it was a short but wonderful experience. The hotel is elegant and pristine and the staff make you feel very welcome.  The room was lovely as was the bathroom, with luxurious towels and good quality products. Breakfast was superb and all the small touches in the room to welcome us were very thoughtful and very much appreciated. Staff are very friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble. Would definitely stay here again :)"
November 2012,A delightful experience,"My mom and dad stayed there for 5 nights and they had a great time. Their stay was perfect and said they would most likely stay there again. The Hotel interior and exterior looks great giving a atmosphere of being in the old English Era. The rooms are cosy and stylishly decorated giving a good feeling of the English way of living. The staff may it be the front desk, the cleaning staff or the concierge services all were very warm, kind and helpful. The breakfast was splendid as well specially the tea which was presented in a lovely way.  The location was great and being near the beautiful Hyde Park, my mom and dad used to go daily for morning walks. Finding taxis was also a breeze and the main market was a small walk away. There were also many restaurant nearby suiting many…"
November 2012,Luxury home away from home,"The good: Beautiful Victorian house, SUPERB CUSTOMER CARE, cozy common areas, great bar, and beautiful tea room.  Incredible staff that one would like to take home (special mention to: Pedro the ""everything to everyone guy"", Markus and Dickson at the bar, and the concierge staff). We were in a large family group so I was able to see several rooms.  All are uniquely decorated and well appointed, with the deluxe rooms being on the smaller side and some lacking in storage area, but with good modern bathrooms.  The Safari jr. suite is fabulous The not so good: At the southwest end of Hyde Park (Kensington Gardens), it is not walking distance from the great area of attractions of Piccadilly, Oxford, Regent, Harrods, museums, Parliament, etc.  However there is a Tube station about 3…"
September 2012,wonderful hotel,I recently stayed at the Milestone Hotel (September 2012) and would definitely give it an excellent rating.  The room had every amenity (stayed in Deluxe King)  you could want and the staff couldn't do enough for you.  The location was good - right near the hop on/off bus - I would definitely stay there again and would highly recommend it.    cj - connecticut
November 2012,Concierge not helpful,"I am staying at the hotel now..I booked through AmEx Fine Hotel and Resorts program. The hotel is located in a mostly resdiential area. The main sites in London, according to the concierge are a 25 minute cab ride away. With the exchange rate, that's about 50 dollars, one way.  I asked the concierge this evening for a nice place in the area to get the flavor of London and he didn't have any suggestions.    The rest of the staff is helpful, but I expected more the for the rating and the cost."
November 2012,Great Service,"I booked a superior room, which was the cheapest fare. Well everything is definitely 5-star, except the size of the room. It feels smaller than Travelodge rooms. One might think its ecological because the room heats up by your body heat, (its that small, but you get what you pay) but then on the other hand, using the aircondition or opening the window helps. Still great, will come again. The small room is fine for a night and on single occupancy. Staying longer needs upgrading..."
October 2012,Wonderful experience,"Stayed here as part of a birthday celebration. We could not fault the hotel at all. What a beautiful place but what made the stay perfect was the staff. Everyone who worked in the hotel were polite, friendly and helpful. We will definitely be staying at the milestone again. Thank you again for such a wonderful time."
July 2012,Afternoon tea at the Milestone :),"My teenage daughter, husband and I really enjoyed the afternoon tea experience at the Milestone.  The service is incredible, the tea rooms are just as the pictures show and the tea and cakes - unforgettable!  We had a wonderful time.  Our waiter was very funny, putting us at ease."
November 2011,my absolute favorite!!,"My fiancé and I are pretty seasoned travelers and have stayed in some amazing hotels all over, but OMIGOD this is my hands-down favorite hotel!! we usually go for more contemporary hotels with modern design, so we were wary of the very traditional look of the Milestone initially. As soon as we parked our car around the corner (!!! we could PARK...that was a great start! haha) and walked in the lobby, we were blown away by how wonderful and attentive the staff were. Our bags were whisked away and replaced with flutes of champagne, and we were greeted by name...""You must be Mr and Mrs Rawding, welcome"". The looks on our faces mustve been priceless. What a stellar greeting. As we were checking in, we were casually lamenting the fact that we were unable to secure a reservation at…"
October 2012,warts and all review,"My wife and I have just returned from a weekend at the Milestone Hotel to celebrate our 14th wedding anniversary. I've been lucky enough to stay at some wonderful hotels throughout the world, both on business and for pleasure from Bournemouth to Bora Bora, but have to say this was one of the nicest experiences yet.   From Manvee on the phone when booking, the doorman on arrival, the reception staff, the concierge, the bar staff (fantastic cocktails by the way!) and the cleaner I passed in the hallway Sunday morning; every interaction with the people who work there leave you feeling like a truly valued customer.  I'm trying to give a balanced review, warts and all, but I honestly I can't fault it.   Following my hotel choice my wife finally recognises what a great bloke I am, so…"
August 2012,olympic experience,"returned to The Milestone for the second Olympic week to celebrate 2 birthdays and an anniversary and everything about our stay confirmed that this hotel is an outstanding property. Our room, overlooking Kensington Gardens was beautiful and the staff was once again friendly, pleasant and went out of their way to make us feel like valued guests. Our anniversary was noted with roses and candles making  our first evening on this trip a special memory.If you have an opportunity, a stay at TheMilestone is a experience not to be missed."
September 2012,Milestone Apartment = Amazing!,"Where to start praising this amazing hotel? My husband and I stayed in Apartment 1 for seven nights in mid-September. First of all, the staff was incredible. We never walked through the lobby without someone acknowledging ""Mr. and Mrs. Jones"" and holding open a door, or calling us a cab. Everyone is so friendly and service-oriented. The hotel itself is great! The decor is beautiful and the dining & bar areas are very cozy.   Apartment 1 was great! There's a large living room/lounge on the main floor. We sat there a few times to catch the light coming in through the windows. The bedrooms, bathrooms and kitchen are downstairs; basically in a basement-like area. At first, it seemed a little darker and ""closer"" down there. But, after hearing some bumps and such from the floor above…"
September 2012,Gracious and friendly,"The Milestone Hotel is quintessentially English, with beautiful rooms and public areas honouring the best of British style and a warm welcome from staff making us feel like honoured guests.  Breakfasts were superb, as were thoughtful touches such as fresh fruit and house-made cookies in our room.  Attention to detail was evident in every aspect of our stay, which was perfect in all respects."
September 2012,Love this hotel!,"We are currently relaxing in our beautiful room at the Milestone and I felt compelled to write a review right away before I forget all the elemets that have wowed us since our arrival this afternoon!  First we were greeted with very warm welcomes from the staff, then we were given a tour of the hotel by the Butler, Pedro. Next we were treatedto complimentary drinks from the bar.  As if that wasn't enough, beautiful little gifts awaited us in our room...a perfume scented sachet for my smelly luggage, a tray of fresh fruit, a ribboned package of dried dates..etc.  On the television apersonnalized welcome message was displayed!  Later themaid left a flower vase with a note asking if we preferedher not touching our personal items when cleaning!  Tonight another little gift left…"
September 2012,Authentic elegance and comfort,"Dear Mr. Pike, My partner and I recently stayed at your hotel to celebrate her 50th birthday.  I simply can't thank you and your staff for making her birthday truly memorable.  We appreciated the room upgrade to the Venetian Suite and the thoughtful touches from canapes in the evening, to the birthday morning breakfast.  But most importantly, as has been the hallmark of your hotel, was the thoughtful service...not imposing or overbearing, but simply hospitable and considerate. We both travel internationally for business and have experienced the grandeur of the Raffles in Singapore, to the flamboyance of the One and Only Royal Mirage in Dubai, to what is considered the gold standard of service at the Mandarin Oriental in Bangkok, but for my partner's birthday we wanted to…"
September 2012,Our new favorite hotel in London,"What an incredible experience.  The staff was phenomenal in anticipating our every need, the room was great with everything ... Including 2 summer and winter robes, fresh fruit and a welcome note from the manager...the bar was beautiful with hand-crafted cocktails and the restaurant was superb with great food and over the top attentive service."
September 2012,once you have tried this hotel you will never go anywhere else in London.,We have just arrived home from a five day stay in the Milestone. From the time you arrive to the time they put you in the taxi and say goodbye the service is excellent.. All of the teams go out of their way to make sure your stay is perfect. They called us by our name at all times greeting us in the morning and on return to the hotel. We were recommended The Churchill pub a short walk away and one of the staff showed me a picture of the pub he had taken on his phone of it that morning!! Having stayed at this hotel we will never go anywhere else in London. This hotel is five star in everything it does. Well done to the whole team.
September 2012,Personal luxury,This hotel is my so far first choice when staying in London. The hotel has a very personal touch by all the staff members and you are beein reconized by everyone in the staff who always are willing to help you with anything.  Just a few minutes to Kenington high str supwaystation or just take the bus a few step from the hotel if you like to travel above ground.   The food is excellent by the Norwegian chef and so so good.  We stayed for two days and had a lovely time and it's just ashame we did not have time to try the poolrelaxing area.  My warmest recommendations.
September 2012,It couldn't have been a better stay...,"We stayed at the Milestone Hotel on Saturday for one night for a long weekend in London for  a celebration. We arrived by taxi, and were met by a well dressed doorman, ( Hat and tails) who advised us to leave the luggage and to go into the hotel, ' he would look after the luggage for us. - our weekend had started straight away.   We were met by very welcoming staff politely and quietly in a sincere and warm fashion. Lovely.   Check In was confirmed and we were advised we were in a beautiful room and luggage would follow shortly. It did - within 7 minutes on arrival in our room ! The room was breathtaking, and a birthday card was on the table from the staff and management and a birthday cake followed within minutes after a phone call offering a welcome drink, whilst we got ready…"
September 2012,Afternoon tea *****,Had afternoon tea today at the milestone I was a bit nervous going in as it was really posh deffinatly not a jeans n tshirt place. On entering the hotel the staff were really friendly and welcoming. The afternoon tea was super we had the half bottle of champagne option and for london and the selection and amount of food you got I felt it was good value. 
September 2012,Excellent service will so many extra personal touches,"We stayed at the Milestone as part of a birthday/anniversary treat.  Nothing was too much trouble, the staff were friendly and very welcoming. Our room was spotless and we were greeted with a welcome glass of champagne to help us settle in.  Well recommended!"
August 2012,Superb,"Stayed there with my miss while visiting friends in London. If you are used to 5-star service, this hotel will not disappoint. Spacious and very well appointed rooms, decorated in Victorian style, friendly staff, personalised service. Location is fantastic, even if you (like we) are not interested in doing much tourism. We stayed there for 2 nights and had wish our visit was longer. Will definitely stay back if back in London."
July 2012,Friendly,"The Hotel is well located,the house keepers are friendly and the service works well."
June 2012,A lovely place to stay,"We greatly appreciated the attention to detail, personal service and willingness to take care of all our needs. Loved the cocktail lounge where the bartenders remembered what you drink and they provide great snacks. Breakfast was always spot on. We also liked the treats on our pillows each of the 5 nights we were there.  Bottom line is that the Milestone a lovely place to stay in London!"
June 2012,The Milestone is a top notch hotel!!!,"We were originally recommended the Milestone by our AMEX platinum travel agent, I believe she had personally stayed there before. We were not disappointed! We were met by Pedro when we arrived, and he showed us around the Hotel and was generally there most of the time to help with anything. My wife 92 year old grandmother lives outside of London and came to visit us after an hour after we arrived, they brought her to the small lounge / bar and we had drinks and snacks and had a great time. Our room was really beautiful and very well kept. My wife and I brought our 6 year old daughter with us and the hotel was nice enough to bring a small little bed in at the foot of our bed. Every night she had a small robe and pair of slippers waiting for her. The concierge always got us last…"
June 2012,"Luxurious, perfect position, fantastic staff, charcter filled and ""clubby""","We stayed at this hotel twice during May and June. The hotel is small, has many nooks and crannies and emanates  the air of a private club. We have studio suites and the rooms were relatively small, this is London though!! The bed and fittings were first class and our view of Kensington gardens was suberb.  The staff were helpful, attentive and genuine motivated to engage with the guests.  This hotel is not like a lrge open plan ""Hilton"" style hotel - think Victorian/Edwardian period biulding with lots of character.   All in all a great experience."
July 2012,The Milestone Hotel - Apartment #3,"The Milestone is a very nice English Country Mansion in the heart of London. We stayed in one of the properties two-bed room apartments (which is part of the hotel). Our apartment was well appointed and fully functional, with plenty of space for my family. Please note there were plenty of outlets for all of our electronics to recharge.  Even though we were in a fully functional apartment, we took full advantage of the hotel's facilities for breakfast and afternoon tea. The staff we interacted with were very attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly, without being overly formal. I would recommend the Milestone for many reasons, however, the primary driver for my recommendation would be the staff, due to their dedication to ensuring we had a positive experience.  Heyward Damon, Jr.…"
July 2012,The Milestone let us down,"Last summer we spent several days at the Milestone which prompted my first Trip Advisor review. We loved every inch of the hotel and found the service impeccable. As strangers, we felt completely taken care of and we were welcomed as if we were old friends with every member of the staff. We have just returned from another stay at the Milestone, this time with our 15 year old son. We requested two rooms for the first 4 nights and then one for the remaining 3. A month prior to the trip we asked if we could extend our stay for another few nights which the hotel could not accommodate. When we arrived, the dates were mixed up and they had my son in the larger room meant clearly meant for a couple. Switching the rooms seemed impossible to the person in charge at the front desk, and my…"
June 2012,THE MILESTONE HOTEL-LONDON.  BEST EXPERIENCE EVER!!,"I was at the Milestone many years ago with my elderly aunt and had a wonderful experience so I  decided I would stay there on this 3 week Europe trip with my 13 year old granddaughter.  We stayed in wonderful hotels across Europe but none came close to The Milestone!   From the minute we arrived everyone treated us as if there were thrilled to see us!  The doorman, the bellman, the concierge, the front desk clerk, the assistant manager, the manager...everyone made us feel so welcomed.  Jose was really the best concierge ever!!  I am so very  glad this is where i was when the accident occurred!  My granddaughter and I were a couple of streets away when i fell over a fallen sign on the sidewalk.  i looked down and saw my thumb laying sideways...not a pretty sight!  My…"
June 2012,A gem in a gem,"The Milestone Hotel has big luxury in a small, intimate and beautiful space.  The location is fantastic, right where you want to be in London.  The rooms are magnificent and all of the comforts you can imagine are there (and even some you cannot imagine). The food, especially the afternoon tea, is the best in London and the staff is beyond gracious.  The Milestone is a treasure in one of the greatest cities in the world.  I highly recommend it!"
May 2012,A good reason to return to London,"We stayed here for three days in May.  We love this area but had never stayed here before. It was recommended by our travel agent and she was absolutely right about the quality. We arrived in the early evening, exhausted by the nightmare of coming through customs and  immigration at Heathrow.  The first room we were shown was too small and taken up by  furniture.  The manager said he would try to find us another room - although since it was late in the day that might prove a problem.  He was successful.  While we waited we were shown into the library and offered a drink - a perfect example of the hospitality shown to guests here.  The  king size room was not very large but big enough and furnished beautifully as is the entire hotel. Since we were too tired to go out for dinner…"
May 2012,Very good,"Amazing service, lovely rooms, friendly staff.highly recommended"
May 2012,Milestone - outstanding experience,"I love everything about this hotel. From the minute you make contact to plan your stay, the service, my room, personal touch on every level is like being home and treated with special care. The accomodations were lovely - the location was perfect for getting around London - easy  walk to the tube; great neighborhood to explore; great  restaurants, museums and parks in walking distance; I was traveling alone some of the time and never felt lonely or unattended to. Staff are like friends now. Concierge staff, bar staff, front desk staff, restaurant staff-everyone looking for ways to make your stay perfect.The restaurant was wonderful -  Hotel manager Andrew sets the right culture of service there and I know something about this in my line of business. I've been twice now and…"
August 2012,Milestones Hotel,"Everything about this little botique hotel was perfect. The staff, ambiance, quality, service, friendliness, helpfullness and above all the entire experience was excellent.  Everyone did as much as they could to ensure your stay was perfect. We were addressed by name as soon as we arrived, our car was parked and collect for us. My boyfriend had a birthday gift and card.  If you needed anything they were only to willing to help. We will be back and just know it will be a wonderful experience.  It was recommended by the Royal Albert Hall and so they gave us a 20% which created a good feel."
July 2012,Wonderful Stay,"We stayed there for a couple of weeks, Great location right across from the park,the hotel offers a lovely atmosphere, very friendly, traditional English decor which we loved. Great service. We will definitely go back."
July 2012,The Milestone Hotel - the very Best of British !!,I stayed at The Milestone for the first week of the Olympics.This Hotel made the holiday even more memorable.This is the best hotel I have ever stayed in and it is the staff who make it such a great place. The service is excellent and you are made to feel so welcome and so much at home. Additionally the Hotel is in a great location in London so that you can walk to all the main tourist attractions after having a wonderful breakfast of fresh fruit and cooked English.The rooms - both bedrooms and public rooms are extremely comfortable and cosy.No request is too much to ask for.I cannot recommend this Hotel more highly and I am already planning my next stay here. David Cullen
July 2012,Excellent,"Stayed here few nights and loved every moment. The hotel has lovely cosy rooms, staff are very friendly, service is great and atmosphere is so welcoming . They makes you feel so valued and special. Highly recommended!"
July 2012,BEYOND BELIEF!!,"We just arrived safely back in Vancouver, BC after an absolutely AMAZING 5 night stay at the Milestone Hotel in London.  I could not get to the computer fast enough to write this review and tell the world how wonderful the Milestone made our stay in London. From the moment we turned to walk into your hotel, we had respectful, kind and caring greeters waiting to help us. Waves, smiles and extremely professional-classy engagement from everyone in the lobby occurred on every venture through the area. It really felt like coming home to a welcoming family each time we landed from a very long, fun-filled, busy Olympic days....""The mist"" (as Grant called it) never drizzled on anyone spirits! Our room, the service, the fresh flowers and elegance of our surroundings were second to none.…"
July 2012,Lovely,"Recently been to London for a business trip and stayed in this hotel for 2 nights. They have lovely,comfortable and cozy rooms, great service and nice atmosphere, staff were very friendly and helpful. I would love to stay here again"
July 2012,Wonderful hotel!,We spent three fabulous days at The Milestone Hotel.  The staff was by far the best we've ever encountered.  They knew our names and went out of their way to spoil us!  The welcome gifts were very thoughtful and the treats in the evening were much appreciated.  Our 10 year old daughter was thrilled with the assortment of candies and goodies placed with her in mind! Our room was gorgeous and we had an incredible view of Kensington.  The Milestone Hotel was the first of three 5-Star Hotels we visited during our 9 day vacation in Europe and it was by far our favorite!  We hope to stay with you again!
July 2012,Great hotel,"This is a lovely boutique hotel.  The staff are extremely helpful and friendly.  Every staff member called me by name (not totally sure how they all knew!)  The welcome gifts in the room are a nice surprise.  Nice parting letter stating they can pack your luggage or pack you an  ""airline picnic.""  Although my room was small, it was very cozy and beautifully decorated!"
July 2012,Excellent service hotel,"I have just spent a night in the Milestones but I was trully surprised with the details offered in every moment (ex. cookies in the room + welcome drink and cappuccino for my daughter + handwritten welcome card), efficiency in reservation, check-in, room service, the personalized service calliing my surname from the begginning to the end, from bellman to housekeeper. The room was not very big but the bed was.  There was robe for me and my 9 year old daughter, and all kind of facilities in the bathroom and room. What called my attentio was the service in the hotel in all sections.  It was great to spend the last day of the trip in the Milestones and I was very pleased with it."
June 2012,You should book this hotel if you would like to enjoy the best of London,"A wonderful warm and welcome English London Hotel. A very good choice for those who like to feel cared for and comfortable. We stayed over the jubilee weekend and had a lovely time.  The service is impeccable, nothing is too much trouble and we found every single member of staff to be kind and genuinely helpful. They continuously looked for ways to make our stay memorable and to anticipate any needs we may have had ~ a rare commodity. The English charm and beauty of the hotel will make for a very authentic stay for guests who are not British and are in the UK to sample the culture and enjoy London. It is a charming hotel overlooking Kensington gardens in a very quiet and peaceful area of London. London can be busy and demanding and exciting, and it is very nice to retire to the…"
May 2012,Best Hotel In London,"If you want to stay at the best hotel in London, this is it! Service is fantastic, they do everything that they say they can and will do, the staff is always thinking ahead and the rooms are beautiful. Close to almost everything and within walking distance to Harrod's and many terrific pubs/restaurants. I can't wait to go back! SWP, Scottsdale, AZ"
May 2012,comfort and elegance,"Even though we only had an overnite,  we were boarding a cruise ship in southhampton the following day, this was a most enjoyable interlude.  The hotel is charming and well kept, but I think the overwhelming asset it has is the service.  The concierge Jose is superb; very helpful and never a negative response to any request. We were a party of five (3 rooms) and each  room, though not large was very well tended.  The breakfast offered was delious and offered a nice variety; we  had dinner as well, but because it was part of an inclusion with platinum american express the menu was quite limited. The location is terrific, walk up a few blocks and there is a whole foods supermarket , of course there is kensington park.  This hotel defintely bears a repeat!"
June 2012,Made me feel like a Queen!,"Very special place to stay.  It is pricey, but every detail is taken care of.  Friendly staff, called us by name after one day there.  Wonderful food, bar, and facility.  The location is just across from the park, near buses and tube stations.  Shopping nearby."
May 2012,Simply the best,"Truthfully there is no better hotel in London, the quality of the staff, the service in the public areas is quite exceptional. As for the rooms I have stayed in numerous , they all have amazing quality, and quite simply everything you could wish for, and a touch more! a wonderful find and my home away from home, if only I could live there!"
April 2012,Quiet - Next to Kensington Park,The Milestone Hotel was a pleasant discovery. Small but comfortable rooms with impeccable service. Lovely bathroom. The restaurant had excellent food and a homely atmosphere. A place to relax after a busy day. I'll definitely return. Elizabeth S. Rasmussen Oslo
May 2012,My Favorite Hotel in the World,"My husband and I love this hotel.    We have been staying at The Milestone since 2006 and each time we return, we are welcomed by the wonderful staff who make us feel like family.   The rooms are wonderful- each one different and a fun surprise to see which one you get. The staff is amazing- especially Pedro the Butler, who greets you upon arrival at the front door, takes you to your room and brings you your first welcome drink.   We love the location because my husband loves to jog in Kensington Park and I love to walk there and watch the people and their dogs.   The bar is one of my favorite in the world, as well, and the bartenders there have become our friends and they know our drinks before we even order.    The location is perfect and the hospitality is warm and welcoming.…"
May 2012,Thank you for a lovely stay,"Considering the price of this hotel compared to the Hilton, the service was far superior.  My room came with a butler and he went the extra mile for me.  It is not often i take the time out to comment, but I must recommend this hotel and all its staff highly."
November 2011,worth the money,this place is definately worth the money. It is in a good location - nice clean reliable hotel. 5 stars
May 2012,Wonderful Personal Hotel in the Heart of London,"Yes, the rooms can be small - but they are beautifully decorated, and every possible amenity is a hand - Penthaglion soap, cleanser, lip balm, 400 thread count sheets,and even the unexpected ones -- for example, the writing desk in the room had stapler, tape, etc.  The hotel is located right on Kensington Park - and the outside traffic can be a tad loud in the rooms fronting the main road -- but  overall the customer service experience is first rate.  I tried the restaurant for both breakfast and lunch and was wowed by the quality of the food and the service staff.  The quiet conservatory bar and adjacent cozy bar were terrific too - intimate spaces with loads of atmosphere.  Check in was so efficient and I never encountered less than two doormen at the front door!   The…"
May 2012,The best service ever.,"This hotel had the best service. If I even thought I wanted something, they were right there. The breakfast was amazing. The waffles are a work of art. The staff was friendly and helpful and the high tea was amazing. We stayed in the Safari suite. It was huge and decorated in a whimsical manner. The location is great. The tube station is right down the block and there is tons of shopping and places to eat, not to mention that Kensington Palace is right across the street. Don't miss the sunken garden, a hidden treasure! Loved it!"
May 2012,Average Hotel With Poor Internet Service,"I am basically confirming the comments made by those reviewers who rate this expensive hotel as merely average.  Our room was very small; we could hardly get past the furnishings and into the bathroom. Indeed, the latter was almost as big as the bedroom.  The staff was ungracious, with the front door being unmanned most evenings we returned from sightseeing.  Although there was staff inside, it was only on the third night of our four night stay that someone acknowledged us.   One of the most annoying things is the poor Internet service. I need to stay in contact with my several businesses through the Internet. Despite being assured of excellent Internet service when we booked, we kept getting bumped off, the signal was weak and the service was slow.  The location of the hotel in…"
April 2012,Fab afternoon tea,"I booked to have afternoon tea here while my Spanish friend visited with his Japanese girlfriend and was so happy I chose The Milestone. They were both totally blown away by the experience! They thought the setting in the park lounge, sat by the fire, was perfeclty British and couldn't get over how great the food was, nor how much of it there was!  Even my friend, husband and I for who this was not our first afternoon tea thought this was the best we have been to in London so far. It's really relaxed and cosy and the service is excellent, very attentive and they are very willing to bring more of whatever you need. Great selection of teas too. I would suggest booking later on in the day as there is more chance of getting a seat by the fire."
March 2012,Loved the Milestone,"I usually stay at the Royal Garden over the road (which I also love), but we had older members of the family who could afford the Milestone. It was a super experience.  We had a family do in central London and were in and out for two days. I can't thank the staff, and particularly the doorman, enough for how smooth they made it for us.  My old mother loved it and would love to stay there again.  But it would also be amazing for something romantic, like an anniversary. I adored breakfast in the lovely green dining room, and I thought what a lovely place it would be for a quiet breakfast meeting (again, in contrast to one at the Royal Garden which also has a lovely dining room but is usually busier). All in all it was a fantastic luxury experience."
April 2012,The Most Incredible Hotel in Kensington!,"My husband and I recently celebrated our 55th anniversary at The Milestone Hotel in London.  It was a return visit - we knew how fabulous the hotel, staff, and amenities would be. But this time, The Milestone staff went above and beyond!  When we returned from dinner on our anniversary, our room had been strewn with rose petals, floating candles were everywhere, champagne was chilling in the ice bucket, soft music was playing, and chocolate strawberries were on the desk!  What an amazing surprise!  Everything about the Milestone is perfect - the most elegant afternoon tea, a scrumptious breakfast buffet, and a concierge and butler who really care, and stand ready to help with even the tiniest request.  We love The Milestone, and hope to be back for another memorable visit in the…"
November 2011,worthy of the praise,"My review reflects the 5-star reviews of the Milestone's other guests. It is a quaint, friendly, warm and luxurious little hotel with a big hart. My daughter and I stayed here for 4 nights and enjoyed everything the hotel has to offer - from their superb dinners, lovely breakfast to high tea."
May 2012,Fifth time and always a treat,"This is my fifth visit in the last two years. Great luxury hotel with a very good breakfast, very high class rooms and a good resturant for dinner. Small pool and gym. All in very good taste, high maintenance and good staff."
May 2012,Treat yourself,Just finished 7 days at the Milestone.  What a great taste of English living.  The hotel has a limited nuimber of rooms and a large staff that is constantly trying to please you.  No request is to small and they take pride in everything they do.    You just cannot go wrong by staying there.
August 2011,The Milestone,"Were there for a week. The rooms were charming and unique, but you need a suite to be able to move around, so that is what we got. The service is very personal and their afternoon tea the best I ever had. The concierge was very talented when it comes to restaurants but with a hiccup; I wanted  them to get us some theater tickets which they actually declined because their agent could not get them. These were not special tickets but this particular show was obviously not on their agents list. That was a let down. They also promised my son a special supprise at the Lion King show which never materialized. Thankfully I never told him so there were no expectations.  The spa looked liked like something from eastern europe 1940 so I never really tried the treatments. The breakfast was…"
May 2012,"Charming, Elegant Boutique Hotel near Kensington Palace","The Milestone Hotel exceeded my expectations. The service is top notch. The decor is breathtaking - my favorite area was the bar, which used to be the stables for this stately mansion. Each room is individually decorated with a distinct personality and when you book your reservation, the team will send you a ""preference list"" which will ask you for things like your favorite drink, newspaper, type of bedding, favorite colors, etc. I imagine this is how they select rooms for their guests, etc. If you are looking to stay in one of the best properties in London, the Milestone  Hotel needs to be on your list. And if the hotel wasn't enough to attract you, how about knowing that Kensington Palace sits literally across the street in Hyde Park? Also a great place for run!"
April 2012,Awesome hotel and apartments-brilliant!!!,"Just returned from April holiday visiting our son who is studying at King's College this semester. We rented an apartment at the hotel-which truly surpassed our expectations. The apartment was beautiful, with magnificently appointed rooms for ourselves and  two of our children- ages 18 and 15. We also had a lovely living/sitting room where we could read, relax, watch movies, visit with our older son and his girlfriend, etc. The kitchen came already stocked with juice, milk, coffee/tea, cereals, yogurt and fresh fruit. The staff is amazing- kind, helpful, hospitable--you truly feel ""at home"", welcome and part of the family. They are solution oriented--  if your college junior decides on the spur of the moment that he wants to sleep over- they have a comfortable bed set up in the…"
March 2012,"Fantastic afternoon high tea, very classy!","I went there with a bunch of friends for afternoon high-tea. I didnt actually pay for the high tea so i can't tell you how much it cost. There were scones with whipped butter and jam. Prawn mayo sandwich (I think), tuna sandwich, ham and cheese sandwich. There are sweets ranging from cheesecake, strawberry cheesecake, fruit tartlets and etc. They were all very yummy and if you want a classy, high-class and girly high-tea with your girly friends, this is the right place.  After the high-tea, there were complimentary cocktails which i think its pretty standard.   The service from the waiter was very good, toilets are clean and atmosphere was very good too.  Please click YES if you think this review is helpful."
April 2012,Best Hotel ever,"I stayed there with my family (wife and three kids 2,4,9) over the easter weekend and i never had a better one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanx to the whole staff, they´ve been so nice and everything was perfect!  The best Hotel ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Michael"
April 2012,Exceptional hotel with a level of service that was all but forgotten...,"My family recently had the pleasure of staying at the Milestone Hotel in the Kensignton area of London.  In all our years of traveling, we have had the opportunity to stay at several high quality hotel establishments including the Ritz, Four Seasons, Cloister at Sea Island, Sanctuary at Kiawah Island and the Breakers in Palm Beach.  However, we have never had an experience quite like the Milestone.  The entire staff from the front desk, to the doormen to the concierge went above and beyond our expectations.  The staff covered every request with genuine courtesy, precision and the utmost professionalism.  More importantly, they made our daughters feel special each and every day.  The highlight of our stay was an afternoon tea that will remain in our hearts for years to come.  The…"
January 2012,Almost an 'excellent',"I do not dish out the 'excellent' badge very often,  but came close this time.  This is a top class hotel,  whilst remaining to be a little quirky and British.  No fancy palm filled atrium here,  but some nice cosy snugs and other little hideaways.  Aims to provide impeccable service,  and came rather close.  My only complaint was that the cooked breakfast really was made to order,  possibly even sourced to order,  as it did not arrive in time for me to eat it.  Breakfast here is clearly to be enjoyed at a more leisurely pace than I could afford."
March 2012,Impeccable Service,"This was my third stay at the Milestone and I am happy to say it did not disappoint. It is in a terrific location right across from Kensington Gardens, it has a wonderful classic London feel - but what really sets it apart is the impeccable service. Each and every person I came into contact with provided excellent service - and it is done in a truly genuine and friendly manner. They make you feel welcome and taken care of - and after a long day it was like coming home.  The hotel itself is very nice ( and I am a picky traveler!) , the restaurant and amenities quite lovely - but the service is something that you just don't get at the other fine hotels. The Milestone is definately the choice I will make on my next trip to London."
April 2012,Service and Location is why I would stay here again but..,"We stayed five days, and every single day without fail all of our needs were met and them some. Our park view was lovely but the Internet service that they say is free is horrible if not impossible to use. You have to keep putting in your specific long winded code and you get bumped if you stay on it. In our room 409 we had a telephone shower, which wasn't what we had hope for, at the price of our stay. The toilet if you flushed it once would run for a long time and not flush again for quite a while. So you can imagine if two people have to really use the Jon. I prepaid for the trip and asked if my trip could be paid with out being converted into pounds, the booker said yes. When the will came in over 86 dollars was added by Amex because they used their conversion service to…"
February 2012,Wonderful Gem in The Kensington Area,"My husband and I were looking for a hotel in the Kensington area to be near our son who is attending an abroad program. We also wanted a hotel with an indoor pool. Previously we have stayed at the Berkeley and the Savoy, both wonderful hotels so we were taking a chance, but were not disappointed. We have now stayed at The Milestone twice in February and are returning in April. It is a lovely gem, small with a lot of character, and wonderful service. It has a thoroughly British, almost Victorian flair and reminds me of the Lowell in New York in terms of size, comfort and service.  We had two different junior suites, The Venetian and The Harlequin. We preferred the layout of the Harlequin but both were lovely. Room service in the morning was exactly on time. We highly recommend…"
March 2012,Wonderful!,"This is an excellent hotel, we enjoyed every minute and had a smile on our faces all day long. It was such a treat to stay here in a friendly and luxurious but still relaxed atmosphere. The salmon at breakfast and the chicken sandwich at afternoon tea were divine."
March 2012,High standards all round,"My wife and I had a three day break here a couple of weeks ago and really enjoyed it.  It doesn't have the enormous public areas and rooms of some London hotels: instead it is 'compact and bijou' along the lines of old Edwardian London clubs, which gives it a nostalgic cozy air that suits us just fine.  We ate out for two nights and only took one dinner at the hotel.  It's usual to explore different nearby eateries when staying at a hotel, but I highly recommend taking at least one dinner here - the cuisine is first class in every way and the service and ambience top notch.  At breakfast on the first morning we experienced a calamity of major proportions when a waitress in training spilled the entire contents of the tea and hot water pots as she endeavoured to place them from…"
March 2012,Simply the home-liest hotel in London,"The Milestone Hotel is our home away from home while in London.  There's something very special about this boutique hotel starting with the location, the warmth of the entire staff, the overall ambience, the decor, the service, the food and above all, the personal touch given on personal requests - this aspect is what I consider to be the hallmark of this cozy hotel. Every request is given the kind of attention that makes one feel spoilt.  After trying several 5-star hotels in London, the Milestone Hotel remains the place for us.  Looking forward to my next visit this month for the 46th time in 7 years!"
April 2012,Excellent place to stay,"Very quiet, clean, upscale, and really cared for us.  Made sure we were doing ok - in a polite English way.  Meals, music with them, the tea in the afternoon, the frontdesk all made the stay one of our most pleasant and comfortable we have had."
April 2012,Faultless afternoon tea,"When in London, we usually have afternoon tea in one of the big five star hotels, so we weren't sure what to expect from a boutique hotel like the Milestone, but were seduced into trying it by an online photo of the Park Lounge. We weren't disappointed. The ambience of the Lounge was fantastic with rich fabrics and huge bookcases of old books - warm, welcoming and sumptuous. The tea itself was great: plentiful finger sandwiches, including a chicken one rolled in chopped almonds; light, warm scones with cream and a delightful strawberry/raspberry mixed jam, plus a good selection of dainty tea pastries - we needed a doggie bag for those! The service was attentive but discreet. We really couldn't fault the whole experience and look forward to going again."
April 2012,Absolute Gem,"Just had a wonderful weekend at the Milestone Hotel, and highly highly recommend this little gem.  I genuinely couldn't fault anything about this wonderful hotel, from the location, to the warm, welcoming and caring staff, to the gorgeous food and wine at the restaurant.  The room was charming, and the bed the most comfortable I've slept in.    Thank you for having us!"
April 2012,Second time around and still wonderful,"We stayed at the Milestone approximately two years ago and it was great, so we went back on our recent trip.  Things HAVE NOT changed.  We had a bigger suite this time, Prince Albert Master Suite and were much happier with the additional room.  Still great service and ambience.  Scones, tea sandwiches were lovely.  The restaurant is great.  Good going Milestone.  Many hotels do not maintain their excellent standards."
April 2012,Amazing afternoon tea,"I picked the Milestone for afternoon tea as the dining room looked really intimate, comfortable and had lovely charm. When we arrived the staff couldn't have been more polite or helpful. The selection of teas was fantastic and there was more than enough delicious sandwiches, warm scones and cakes to go round. Often with afternoon teas in London the cakes are a little sub standard, more attention going onto appearance than taste but that was definitely not the case here. We had a lovely relaxing afternoon, so much so that time ran away with us before we'd had a chance to have our complimentary cocktail but the staff we very willing to serve us in the bar area which was fabulous, very 'ralph lauren' style with horse painting and a cigar room vibe.  I'd whole heartedly recommend…"
April 2012,Outstanding service and attention to detail,"A colleague and I stayed at this luxury hotel for two nights at short notice. The staff were extremely welcoming upon our arrival and gave us a guided tour of the facilities whilst our luggage was taken upstairs.  The rooms (a King Double and Studio) were unforgettable; true luxury which was a welcome retreat at the end of each day.  On top of the luxury of each room, the services were excellent. Satellite TV, reliable Internet access and top draw room service.  Our breakfast each morning was superb and the hotel is literally 3 minutes walk from High Street Kensington tube station (sadly our expenses policy didn't quite cover the use of the hotels Chauffeur driven Bentley...).  Highly recommended all round!"
April 2012,superb hotel,"Visited this hotel April 2012, and the hotel is exceptional in many ways; from top location to quality of rooms and decor, topped off with a commitment to great service you wont see in many places in London.  I was on business on this occasion but already looking into a family stay at the hotel.  All in all very special and although price reflects this - it is far superior to all of the chain hotels which offer similar rates."
April 2012,The most amazing experience,"We recently stayed at the Milestone Hotel in one of their apartments.  We were traveling with 2 teenage children and my mother.  The accomodations were fabulous!  We had so much space and the rooms were beautful. The service was exceptional...the hotel didn't know what to do for us next and the food was great. Breakfast was wonderful, we really enjoyed high tea and had a lovely dinner one eve in the hotel sitting by the fireplace. The concierge service was top notch. In fact, I forgot my house keys at the hotel and they immediately sent my keys back to me in the states. I travel alot for business and pleasure and must say that this was one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. I highly recommend this hotel and will definately stay there on our next trip to London.  It…"
March 2012,"Small, beautiful and excellent hotel! Wow!","We stayed one week at Milestone in March 2012.  This hotel is very special and is a real 5 stars hotel.  Beautiful decor in our room, excellent service from everybody from the concierge to the room service.  The food was excellent,  the decor unforgettable.  Everybody made us feel good.  Perfectly located.  We will choose this hotel again for sure and will remember the truly warm hospitality.  You won't regret your stay."
February 2012,The best afternoon-tea ever,"I was looking for a nice and traditional place to have afternoon-tea in London and I found The Milestone on the list of the Top London Tea Place Awards 2011.  So I was sure I was going to find something very nice.  And The Milestone has by far exceeded my expectations. I had the best afternoon-tea ever! The room where the afternoon-tea takes place is a very beautiful room, with a magnificent decoration. I was seated in the Library where I had the feeling that time had stopped.  I had a very nice view on Kensington gardens.  The food itself was absolutely fantastic.  I am looking forward to go back and I don't want to have afternoon tea somewhere else in London now.  I also had the chance to visit the hotel. The rooms are nicely decorated.  Every room is decorated in a different…"
January 2012,MAGNIFICENT MILESTONE STAY,"Stayed at Hotel 41 for four days before a cruise out of Southampton.  On the return, we stayed three nights at The Milestone including New Year's Eve.  We were so spoiled at Hotel 41 that we thought there was no way The Milestone could compare.  Well it did nicely.  We did not have that one on one feeling with staff like Hotel 41 but the staff at The Milestone was excellent.  The concierge spent time with us arranging a trip to Paris.  He took his time, booked the train tickets and printed them.  Whenever we needed to make or change a dinner reservation he did it with total class.  The bell staff was also very polite and they all seemed to know our name.  Our room at The Milestone was magnificent!!  Probably the nicest hotel room I have ever experienced.  Think it was the Tudor…"
December 2011,Our luxurious home from home in London,"We stayed at Milestone for five nights at Christmas, from 23 to 28 December, and we had our Christmas Eve Dinner and Christmas Day Lunch in Cheneston’s restaurant. This was our second stay at the hotel, and we had a perfect Christmas away from home. We loved every minute of it, and we have already booked our third stay in February 2012.  We have travelled quite a lot all over Europe, and we have visited several five star hotels. Milestone is by far the best of them, with warmth, personal service and a welcoming kindness that we have never found anywhere else. London is our favourite town, and Milestone is our favourite hotel.   We will recommend general manager Andrew Pike and his lovely staff in a wonderful Kensington building."
December 2011,Truly a home away from home...Outstanding!!,"My wife and I stayed at the Milestone Hotel for nine nights over the Christmas and New Year holiday.  I cannot say enough about the management, staff and hotel in general.  Without exception, every staff member treated us with the utmost respect and really, really seemed to care about our needs.    We initially had some concerns about staying in a hotel on Christmas Day but the Milestone and its staff made it a wonderful (and very memorable) day.  The day started by us finding a Christmas stocking with wrapped presents attached to our hotel room door on Christmas morning...then we had a fabulous full English breakfast in our room followed that evening by an outstanding dinner in Cheneston's Restaurant...finally, we capped off this great day with evening tea in the library (which…"
December 2011,Fantastic 50th Birthday Surprise!,"We stayed here in December for husbands 50th birthday.  He had no idea where we where going, everything had been booked and arranged in secret, and i am pleased to say, we both had a fantastic time.  All the staff are very friendly and helpful, nice touch to be called by your name, and also remembering what you had to drink the night before when ordering a drink the next evening. The staff we found, are about when required, and very helpful and friendly, not constantly hounding you!   Suite was beautiful, well equipped, romantic turndown was beautiful, and all the other little touches left in the room both nights.  Food was good, breakfast was beautiful, did have to wait for a table on the sunday morning, but not for long, maybe only 5 mins, so not a problem at all, nice chance…"
December 2011,The most supurb afternoon tea,"I had the pleasure of having afternoon tea with my fiance' and parents before going to Royal Albert Hall for a Christmas concert.  The Milestone had won the the Top London Tea Place awards of 2011, so I was curious if it had truly deserved this honour.  The hotel itself was absolutely divine.  Interiors of a high quality and very welcoming staff. The room in which the afternoon tea was served was was just the right size and very cozy and warm.  The environment was tranquil, peaceful and very civilized. It really is a place to enjoy the comforts of British food culture with good company.    The afternoon tea itself was of a very high quality and the presentation was immaculate.   The Milestone truly deserved its win in 2011 and I'm sure will continue to keep its reputation as the…"
July 2011,excellent place to stay,On arrival at the Milestone we were greeted by very friendly concierge staff who quickly organised our rooms and luggage. The junior suite had excellent taste and decor. The rooms had everything to make our stay comfitable. What made our stay enjoyable was the personel touches like the turn back of the bed with a book and book light together with chocolates on the pillows.The bathroom was filled with luxurious cosmetics of excellent taste. We have stayed at several 5* hotels in the city centre for conveniance but in our opinion nothing compares to the service and little extras provided at the Milestaone. My wife felt like a celebrity.  The hotel has an excellent view of Kennington Palace and Hyde Park. Keep up the good work.
September 2011,Service the old London way,"We arrived at The Milestone Hotel on September 10th  From the time we stepped from our cab until we were bid farewell at 7pm on September 13th, The service we received from your professional ,friendly staff was nothing less than outstanding.   Your hotel was recommended to us by our Travel Agent- James Irving of MTA Travel -Robina Queensland Australia James has been handling our travel arrangements for over 20 years and is very aware of our needs. The Milestone certainly measured up to our expectations and more. The staff, from the Door ,Reception, Bar,Restaurants,Service to room are all to be congratulated for their excellent service. A family member surprised us by booking into your hotel for 2 nights. We knew we had a very good package deal organised by James. I approached…"
October 2011,Wonderful hotel in good location,We stayed at The Milestone in early October and very much enjoyed the whole experience.  The public rooms are so beautiful and we were treated to a tour of the building after enjoying a welcome glass of champagne on arrival.  We enjoyed a pre-theatre dinner in the restaurant (which we had to ourselves) and it was really excellent.  Our room was a little on the small side but exquisitely furnished with a beautiful bathroom.   Unfortunately a carpenter was working on the conservatory roof outside our room in the afternoon when we wanted to take a short nap but we understand that maintenance has to be done at some time!  That was certainly the only negative.  The service was superb and all the staff bent over backwards to make sure we really enjoyed our stay.
January 2012,Simply the best hotel we have ever stayed in,"This is a very beautiful hotel, wonderfully situated and really quite perfect.  Every single member of staff made us feel very welcome, and all the little touches that set this hotel apart were very much appreciated.  I would recommend The Milestone without hesitation, and cannot wait to return and stay a little longer; one night was not enough!"
November 2011,Nothing is too much trouble,"Had a wonderful weekend at the Milestone with my daughter on our first mum and daughter weekend shopping for her birthday. Staff  made us very welcome, all knowing my name. we had pre booked  tickets to see The Lion King that evening which were brought to our room.  (good seats) Had a burger in the lounge which was really good, we didn't have afternoon tea but it looked amazing.  Next day we had a full day shopping on our return there was a much needed pamper pack left in our room. Bath soak, foot scrub and face mask.. bliss.   Breakfast was good service again fantastic.   Our room also had homemade cookies which were soon tasted. Penhaligon products which smelt lovely.   On departure our bags were looked after until we headed to the airport.   5 service"
November 2011,Perfect service,The staff was courteous and very helpful.  Always on the job.  This was a truly 5-star experience.  The rooms were pretty and there were a lot of nice touches from the cookies & prunes that greeted us to the fancy Penhaligon bath products.  Room service delivered tasty food quickly at 1am.  The staff anticipated our needs and gave us a tour of the hotel & also pointed out things of interest in the neighborhood.  The bed was very comfortable.
November 2011,Great hotel,Enjoyed a nice stay here  Food was great as was hospitality
November 2011,Like a vintage bottle of wine.,"If you go to the The Milestone Hotel expecting an Ian Schager like experience with Armani Clad staff whispering into wrist microphones to maintenance the moment there is a finger print on an Elevator button you are going to be disappointed, however if you expect an extremely classy while managing to stay informal and highly personal experience of a quintessentially British hotel with tremendous history and impeccable service, then you are in for a treat.  One could be critical at first glances, but then you would be completely missing the point. This is a boutique hotel located in a premium area and innovative architecture and design have extracted beauty from every one of those precious square feet.  From the moment you walk in staff are attentive, but more importantly…"
October 2011,You’ll get what you pay for!,"A truly 5-star is definitely here. We had a memorable noble life in The Milestone a couple of weeks ago. Our superior  room is designed with the luxurious English living style with antique furniture with lots of artwork and small brilliant details in every inch of the room. The staff are professional and very helpful in case we need anything. The restaurant below serves the exact standards of what so-called “fine dining”. Everything, of course, was pricey but it worths nothing for the benefits and comfort we gained during our stay. The only hardest thing to do is spend our most in this all-the-best-in-one-place hotel like this!"
October 2011,"Beautiful hotel, great service","We had a great stay at the Milestone. It is very tastefully done (we were in the ""Jungle Room"") and offers truly exceptional service. The neighborhood is very nice although with all the construction going on in London for the Olympics, taxi service to the major attractions like the Tower is both slow and expensive. Overall a great hotel worthy of the high rankings it receives."
September 2011,Treated like royalty,My wife and I recently spent a week at the Milestone Hotel in London. Our expectations were very high given the comments we had read but they managed to exceed even those lofty expectations. For the second we walked through the door we felt incredibly welcomed and pampered. Can't wait to go back.
October 2011,so english,"My mother was French and I always say in Paris I am happy and in London I feel virtuous and civilized.My husband got sick upon arriving at the airport and the hotel's car stood with us for 4 hours while he went to hospital ,taking us back to heathrow airport to pick up his passport,I must say Collin the driver was the perfect person to have on your side at a moment like this.Fortunately there was nothing serious and we enjoyed our stay at this very professional hotel who even sent me a box of chocolate for my birthday.I even felt happy in London.The neighborhood and the staff did it"
June 2011,"A ""Sanctuary"" in a busy city","I should have written this sooner but we have just returned from extensive traveling.  We stayed at the Milestone on the recommendation of our son and daughter-in-law, as well as our good friend, who is a Virtuoso travel agent.  The overall experience was that of visiting a grand house, with a staff that is most eager to make sure that each guest is treated as if he or she is the only one to be served.  Our children joined us along with their 8 year old daughter.  We are all particularly thankful for the most delicious tea that was served to us in the dining room upon our arrival - a bit outside the normal service time.  The cucumber sandwiches were the best I have ever eaten.  (...and this coming from a lady from the South who has eaten cucumber tea sandwiches since she was…"
October 2011,What a delight,"Recently I have had the chance of staying at the Milestone and must say.. what I delight!! From the comfy bed to the great amenities.. The service is excellent, all staff was helpful, professional and genuinely nice (special thanks to Pedro, the butler!). I also enjoyed some relaxing and cosy moment in the living room (with a beautiful decoration and fireplace) while I had a bite. The wifi is free and easy to connect, always useful! Location was perfect, with the park, shops and metro around the hotel. Loved the luxurious feeling while feeling like ‘at home’. Next time, I’ll need to enjoy the pool and the famous afternoon tea!"
September 2011,My wife and I loved it all!!!,"Our trip from Sept-4 to 7th I have been to Europe several times but this was my first trio with my wife. It is difficult to pick the first hotel of your stay because you want it to be memorable. After reading all the ratings we settled on the Milestone. It is in a great location, you can walk, take the bus or the train conveniently to any location. The breakfast was excellent and we found the staff extremely accommodating. Diner was the best meal we had in 15 days in Europe with the exception of Guy Savoy in Paris. We had the special 7 course sampler the food was excellent and the atmosphere and banter with the staff was fun. We were in the safari suite which was fantastic.  The Concierge services were right on point and very helpful. The front desk staff was pleasant in every…"
July 2011,Tops!!!!,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Milestone.  Perfect location. The staff was warm, friendly and they all had a wonderful sense of humor. We hope to return someday. "
September 2011,Consistently Outstanding,"Our second visit to the Milestone.  I can't say enough about how good this hotel is.  Neil, the Assistant Concierge is amazing.  He goes above and beyond to be sure guests are well taken care of.  Everyone else on the staff is totally guest focused.  Pedro and Graham were delightful.  Our dinner at Chenestons was perfect.  The room was lovely and well appointed.  We will be back again!"
May 2011,Did it live up to my high expectations?  YES !,The staff are very attentive and are highly skilled at what they do. The staff obviously care about the level of service they are providing which is pleasing. That said if you are like me and do not like too much fuss I found them generally perceptive to this. The rooms are lavish and extremely clean. The food in restaurants is excellent as you would expect. Without going into the realms of fantasy about the place I have to say it surpassed my expectations. We had one hiccup during our stay and that was over a breakfast we had requested in our room by way of leaving a notice detailing our order on the door handle. When the allotted time came..no breakfast! I phoned reception to be informed they had not received the order. They were mortified and by the time we ventured…
August 2011,"Not perfect,but close",We normally have stayed in some pretty good London hotels but wanted a change.....and how pleasantly surprised I and my fellow guests were. The management and staff do care and understand who paying their wages. Hope they never forget and keep up the good work...this way they'll keep being head and shoulders above the rest.
June 2011,The warmest welcome I have ever had in London,"we stayed at the Milestone in June 2011, on the final sector of a round-the-world trip.  We had come from Washington DC, where the staff of the hotel had earned a letter from me to the Manager because of their condescending and dismissive attitude.  Coming after this, the Milestone could not have been more of a contrast, and such a welcome contrast at that.  We were greeted very warmly, and shown to our room by the butler, who seemed genuinely concerned that we be truly delighted with our room.  He rang back 15 minutes after he had left, just to be certain. shortly after that, Tea was delivered to our room.  The restaurant was very good, and wine-matching from the excellent cellar was exemplary.    This hotel's greatest asset is the happy, interested and genuinely joyful vibe…"
August 2011,Beyond expectations - the only place we will stay in London!,"From the minute you arrive, the staff cannot do enough for you. Our room was spacious and well appointed. Excellent breakfast and afternoon tea. The location overlooking Kensington Gardens was beautiful."
September 2011,"Personal welcome, beautiful and comfortable - we'll be back!","From the friendly welcome at reception and personal attention from the butler who showed up our room, to the handwritten welcome letter from the hotel general manager (and biscuits!) waiting in the room. Every detail to make your stay comfortable has been thought through. the room had real wow factor - upholstered wallpaper, 1920's accessories combined with countryhouse chic furnishings.  The hotel room was fully kitted out like a small apartment - very convenient of packing light ofr a business or leisure visit to London.  We were there for one night only - was situated perfectly for walking to the Proms that night at the Royal Albert Hall. Thing I liked least was the small bathroom. Though luxuriously furnished, it was a tight squeeze to get round the door to the facilities. A…"
August 2011,Perfect in every way,"Our family experience here was perfect in every way.  We traveled with our young son and were welcomed, charmed and left wanting to come back again and again."
August 2011,A Very Happy Birthday for Me,"Pure hedonism lots of lovely little touches. The service was superb and friendly. Marcus the cocktail steward made the meanest dirty gin martinis. A lovely way to celebrate my ""milestone"" birthday."
July 2011,Favorite London Boutique Hotel,"Super-clean! Awesome staff! The recently re-done Tudor Suite is amazing! Loved Neil-the concierge-super helpful and a positive disposition, meeting Andrew-the GM and Steph-F&B Mgr at a happy hour: great guys! The housekeepers were the best-so discreet, never intruded + great turndown service. I love coming back to The Milestone (unlike No. 11 last year). Hoping to return soon and could easily stay longer than the 5 nights we did stay!"
June 2011,One of the most oustanding hotels we have ever been to,The milestone hotel was one of the best experience I have ever had as a traveler.. We went to London to go to wimbledon and this was over the top... We had 2 butlers and the concierge was amazing.  The room was beautiflul clean and ohhh so comfortable...  The food was yummy!! The service was impecable.  We Highly recommend this little piece of heaven.
June 2011,Great Stay at the Milestone,"Our first time in London and we couldn't have picked a better spot to stay.  Kensington is lovely and the Milestone is a great location in Kensington.  The staff prides itself on making your stay enjoyable -- and they succeeded.  We booked through the American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts Program -- well worth it.  We did not receive the room upgrade (as is possible when booking with AMEX FHR -- we actually had a small room), but the hotel made up for this by providing us a free valuable dinner at their high quality restaurant.  They did not need to do this, but offered this to us.  Dining in London is really expensive for Americans, so we certainly appreciated the offer. Breakfast as part of FHR  at the Milestone was available via room service for no extra charge --…"
June 2011,I wouldn't stay anywhere else in London,"I occasionally have the opportunity to stop in London for business and when doing so like to take some time to enjoy London.   The Milestone is the perfect place for both.      The location has good access for taxi's and drivers and also close to the London underground.  Located just off Kensington High Street there is lots of shopping close by, Portobello Market is walking distance , and Hyde Park is just accross the street for a relaxing walk or morning run.  Royal Albert Hall is only a few blocks down the street as well as a number of must see museums - Natural History, Kensington Palace  and the Victoria and Albert.  The hotel itself is fabulous.   Each room is different (I have visited five times now and look forward to the next)... all are nicely decorated, and truly make…"
May 2011,good service and nice hotel,The hotel it is located in a nice area of London-was my firt time in South Kensington In the beginning I had a room without view not so nice but after I please the reception to change the room.I had some difficulties but finally they gave me a very nice Junior suite-Paris -very charming and located to the last floor with a very nice vue to the park Breakfast was very nice-if and if the english breakfast was included in the price of the room the continental one was enough for me.I had also the afternoon tea in the hotel-also nice/ Despite to same dificulties in the beginning finally was a very nice stay. mm1118
June 2011,Excellent service!,The hotel is beautifully decorated and the staff are first rate. The food was delicious. It was a fabulous place to stay.
June 2011,Like a guest on a country estate,"Living at the Milestone hotel feels like being a guest of honour at a country estate. It is a small hotel and you d. not stay there if you want to be anonymous. They remember your name and are genuinely concerned to put their guests at the centre of attention. The personnel are polite, but present and fun to talk to.  The interior is sumptuous and beautiful, with heavy curtains and covered walls in beautifull, clear colours. A lot of the guests are American and many have been here before. This not difficult to notice as the staff remember them and are carefull to use their names. This is clearly a place where many people feel very comfortable. The rooms are well-equiped with PC, DVD and iPhone cradles (?) plus a selection of magazines chosen with you in mind. If you feel like a…"
September 2010,Best Hotel in London,"The Milestone may be the best hotel in London. Yes, it is pricey, but well worth the expense. From the moment you enter the lobby, where the welcoming staff make you feel right at home, to the formal tea you may take in the drawing room, the Milestone delivers. No detail is too small. Rooms are elegantly appointed, comfortable, and a cut above. This stay was our third, and we have never been disappointed."
December 2010,Not the best but very nice,"Milestone is a very nice hotel at a beautiful area. It may not be the best hotel I have ever stayed, but it is a nice place to stay for a few days for a short break in London"
May 2011,We loved it and plan a return visit as soon as we can!!,The Milestone Hotel is the finest hotel we have ever visited. My husband and I are ardent travelers and have been all over the world and will be happy to re-visit the staff at the Milestone Hotel whenever we will be in London. We felt very much at home and felt sad to say good-bye.
May 2011,What you would expect a British Hotel to be - AMAZING!,"We initially booked this hotel because our main priority was to stay within walking distance of the Royal Albert Hall.  My goodness,  we were not expecting it to be so amazing.  The front desk staff are probably the most polite and helpful I have ever come across, and I am fairly well travelled.  They are incredibly ""proper and british"" which added to the ambience of the hotel.  Nothing was too much trouble and you were treated like Royalty.  They remembered your name every time they saw you which I thought was a very nice touch.   We were given a guided tour of the hotel when we first arrived and then a complimentary glass of champagne.    The room was beautifully decorated and the bed was heavenly.  We felt as though we had discovered a goldmine with this hotel and will find…"
June 2011,MORE LIKE A COUNTRY HOUSE WEEKEND THAN A LONDON HOTEL,"Regarding our recent five day stay at the Milestone, we can only say that we feel that the Management have got the balance just right. Its a difficult trick to pull off but the staff were efficient whilst being genuinely helpful and friendly. More like a country house weekend than a city centre hotel. It is something we have become used to in the more relaxed setting of Bushman's Kloof (the Groups Wilderness Reserve in the mountains of the Cederberg in the Western Cape) - so a well done to the staff at the Milestone.     We wanted to stay at the Milestone as a special treat when we came to London to see family from South Africa as it was my 65th birthday. We have stayed at other hotels in the Red Carnation Group namely Bushman's Kloof and Twelve Apostles in Capetown but what we…"
May 2011,Absolutely wonderful experience,The Milestone met our expectations and exceeded them in every way. The service was outstanding and the staff could not have been more friendly. From the minute we arrived we were greeted warmly and personably. Thank you for a wonderful experience.
May 2011,A beautiful Hotel with impeccable service,"Having been to London several times before, I researched a number of potential Hotels for our stay. The Milestone was chosen based on the positive reviews on Tripadvisor. We stayed for 7 days during the middle of the month. We booked a Deluxe Studio room and upon check in, we were upgraded to a suite. This was an especially lovely gesture on the part of the Milestone. Many Hotels pretend to be 5 star plus and have all the usual superlatives about staff and service yet usually fall down on the most important item - Service. This is where the Milestone excels - the service is outstanding. It appears the staff actually enjoy their jobs and are interested in ensuring the guests have a wonderful stay. From the Concierge and his staff (every day they were helpful with directions and…"
May 2011,Royal treat,"My wife and I stayed four nights in the Milestone Hotel. From the moment we arrived we had the best treat we ever had in Europe. Everything was beyond our expectation despite all the great reviews we already read in trip advisor. Location is very central, near to underground, Hyde park, Nothing Hill, Museums, great restaurants and shopping district (in particular Harrods). Everyone in the Hotel is so friendly, professional and courteous that make you feel like staying in your own home with special service. We're upgraded to a studio room which was spectacular with all kinds  of in room amenities you could imagine. We had a bottle of champagne in the room with a beautiful card for my wife's birthday which really appreciated and portrayed the thoughtfulness of the management. I…"
May 2011,"Sincere, first class service in elegant Victorian-era surroundings","We just spent 4 days at The Milestone and can't conjure enough superlatives to do the property and its fantastic staff justice.  From the blooming flowers, cloud-like bed and large, marble bath (with loads of Penhaligon toiletries) in our roomy suite to the superb, gracious personal service from the front desk (Stephanie and Alexandra), concierge (2 equally helpful gentlemen), doorman (Danny and another gentleman whose name escapes me now), butler (Francis), housekeeping (thank you for the turn-down service, canapés, bottled water and chocolates), restaurant (thanks, Jack and 2 other colleagues for serving such memorable English breakfasts) and spa (thanks again, Fiona!) we were wowed and have found our home away from home in London.  The Milestone is located just across from…"
May 2011,"Luxurious London, pampered perfection!","My wife and I stayed for one night as part of a trip to an event at The Royal Albert Hall, (just 5 mins walk down the road). From the minute we arrived we were treated like royalty by the team. The hotel is luxurious and intimate, our room was beautiful and the Afternoon Tea... wow! To Fran and the rest of the amazing staff... thank you, thank you, thank you, and much like Eric Clapton at the RAH... we will be back!"
May 2011,Like a private club,"I've just completed a weekend at the Milestone. All I have to say is perfect. It is very different from other 5 stars hotels I've stayed at and that's what makes the Milestone pretty unique.To the busy, pristine and sometimes cold and impersonal ultra-luxury-wow-factor, the Milestone gives you cosiness, personal touches, and the surprises of the unexpected.  It feels like being in a private club you're a member of from year for every single staff seems to know you and call you by your name. Everybody's so nice.  Every room is different; I don't only talk about the bedrooms but also the lobby, the lounge, the bar, the restaurant. For instance, having a drink at the bar is like going back in time and being in an BBC ""the Avengers"" episode. Staying at the Milestone is like staying…"
May 2011,Wonderful treat even for Londoners,"My fiancee planned a night at the Milestone as a surprise. We live in London and usually go outside of the city and stay in a converted manor home or B&B but we always talk about staying in a quintessential London Hotel. We had an amazing evening. As the evening was a complete surprise, the staff were very helpful arranging everything for him. When we returned from dinner there was a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us----without him even asking. The hotel is also just a short walk from our favorite restaurant, The Launceston Place----amazing food, service, and romantic atmosphere. The next morning was followed by breakfast in bed and champagne. We took a leisurely stroll through the park following breakfast before we returned home.  Although we…"
May 2011,Best personal service hotel,"Just spent 8 days at Milestone, they have 5 apartments if you want to stay over a week, with kitchens and living rooms.  The hotel is traditional english, rooms are small, ditto bathrooms but very pretty and each unique.  Service from the moment you walk in is over the top, they call you by name, no question stumps the Concierge (best one is Jose), but everyone from waiters to housekeepers are fabulous.  Its expensive, for sure, but worth every minute. Location across from Kensington Park and Palace make it more homey feeling.  Be aware, all of London is under construction in anticipation of the 2012 Olympics"
September 2011,the best hotel in london !,"my wife and i , stayed at the milestone hotel for our 3rd wedding anniversary , we had an amazing experience in what is an absolutley beautiful hotel , the best hotel in london by a mile . five star  location - in a lovely area of london facing kensington gardens the hotel is near many of the top tourist attractions such as the royal albert hall and knightsbridge .  the rooms - wow . what can i say ? the room we stayed in was a deluxe studio and although it was expensive , it was amazing , absolutly beautiful. we stayed in room number 426 and it was amazing . the room was decorated beautifully and the bed was very comfy . the room was very spacious , plenty of wardrobe space and a fantastic view of kensington gardens . when i booked the room i asked for the most romantic room…"
September 2011,Melissa first trip to London,"A wonderful london experience.  Their attention to detail is second to none.  Personalized pillow selection, comfortable beds, large bathrooms, tasteful decor, fabulous food, friendly and accomodating staff, intimate settings, delightful different candies each night on your pillow...all made for a wonderful stay in London."
September 2011,Really enjoyed this hotel.,We so enjoyed staying here with my husband. It is close to everyplace you would wish to visit and the staff is so nice. The breakfast was outstanding! After reading all the great reviews we knew we had to stay here!!
January 2011,Superb....!,"Excellent staff, rooms, and service at the Milestone Hotel. Pefect combination of service without snob. Rooms are wonderful with excellent beds and perfectly formed, the bathroom amenities were exclusive. Location is great. Staff are very helpful and professional at all times. Any need is met with timely and high level service. Don't want to rave too much as would like to be able to get a room there in the future! Thanks to all the fantastic staff at the Milestone. I would highly recommend this hotel."
September 2011,Out of 10   - The Milestone is an 11 !!!!!,"The Milestone, in London - England , is a superb hotel!  The entire establishment is extremely clean and the rooms are well-appointed.  The Milestone staff couldn't be more helpful and pleasant.   The concierge, Neil, is brilliant and truly understood the type of restaurant and activities my husband & myself were interested in.  At the finest of restaurants, Neil was able to reserve the best tables for us. Breakfast at The Milestone is a true treat!  The food selection was varied and delicious.  Stefan and Jamal made sure that our early morning food experience was delightful. When we return to London this is the only hotel we will reserve~!!!!  *Interesting, I always complete the surveys provided by hotels at the end of our stay.  The Milestone is the only place in which I…"
September 2011,Good Stop,Wife and I stayed in London for two nights.  The Milestone was our stop.  The rooms were great although typical London small.  Bed was beautiful and bathroom was very nicely arranged.  We hung at the bar for two nights and had lovely service and a great late night burger.  The staff treated us nicely even though we might have had our loud American hat on when we got to conversing with other guests.  They seem to be used to us Yanks needing to stay up a little late since we traveled without an overnight stay.and it was difficult to sleep at 7 PM EDT.  They served us until 1 AM London time while we laughed with a nice couple from Florida.  Had good recommendations for restaurants and it was great to be across the street from the park.
September 2011,Phenomenal experience,"The service we experienced far exceeded our already high expectations created by the prior reviews. Their attention to detail began upon confirmation of the reservation when they asked for details such as type of pillow etc to ensure our stay would be as memorable as possible.  The conceirge was very helpful and courteous and all the other staff were highly attentive at all times. I believe this is what distinguishes this hotel from many other fine 5 star establishments in London. The room's decor was full of character and added to the uniqueness of the experience. On a balanced note their irish coffees could have been more generous in size, given their cost."
September 2011,A Special Place,"Our September 2011 visit to London was wonderful. An important part of our successful trip was choosing the Milestone Hotel as our place to stay while in London. It is a charming hotel with a dedicated staff who work very hard to make sure their guests are happy. My wife and I selected a basic room. The room was charming albeit a trifle small for two people. However the bathroom was very spacious with excellent amenities. My wife and I loved the decor of the entire hotel which is warm, comfortable and pleasing to the eye. We did not choose to have breakfast included but we did have one breakfast at the hotel and it was very good. If you are looking for a small and intimate hotel in London, that provides first rate service, stay at the Milestone. I'm sure that you will not be…"
September 2011,I `ll be back,This is properly best hotel I never have visit in the whole world. Everything went so easy. First from the booking of the hotel to the in-checking etc. It is a very professional hotel and everything went 100% on our 5 days visit there. We had a large room and properly the largest bathroom I ever have seen. It is so nice inside and so clean. The staff are brilliant and you just can`t get a better location in London. It is so near everything. Yes it is expensive but it is worth the price.
September 2011,We got there in the end...,"My wife and I spent 3 nights in the Margaret Rose room to celebrate her 40th birthday.  First the bad news: initial thoughts were a little underwhelming given the hasslefree booking process (thanks to Marietta) as many of the small things we had stipulated on the client preferences form were not available or fell short of expectation (a birthday card for me rather than my wife!, pre-loaded iPod, morning newspaper, welcome fruit plate, replacement in-room tea tray, no sound from the DVD player etc..).  Although these are only minor shortcomings they are shortcomings nevertheless and it appeared that the hotel was not managing our high expectations.  Now the good news:  On listening to our issues (Stephanie, Frits etc) the hotel was uncompromising in trying to make up for our…"
May 2011,Loved it,"I stayed with a friend (who had stayed before) and wished I could have stayed longer. I have stayed in lots of large purpose built hotels but the Milestone beats these hands down. We had a room overlooking Kensington Gardens and the coffee in the room was much appreciated first thing in the morning, not your instant but real coffee with a cafetiere which I love. We had an evening meal which was lovely  and the breakfast was just as good. Eggs Benedict best I have had. The afternoon tea was delicious and the home made scones were fantastic, the only thing I would I would do next time is have a stronger tea. I would have loved to have seen more of the rooms but the hotel was busy so not possible. Would love to stay again in the future."
April 2011,Best Fantastic Hotel in Europe,"The best service we have ever received. The amazing staff at this hotel have a unique way of making you feel that you are the most important guest that has ever stayed. I found that  the service and attention to detail in both design and comfort that the Milestone provides, to be the best in London. The food is consistently excellent and they can usually handle any order you can think of.The room was fantastic! Room service was superb and they even have a pool and a fabulous masseuse. We will definitely be booking here for our next trip to London."
May 2011,Yet another lovely stay,"My friend and mysef stayed here for 2 nights and loved it. I had stayed here before with the hubby but it was my friends 1st time. We were given room 310 which had a wonderful view of the park. The staff as usual could not do enough for you. The only down side was the fact ,on Saturday morning after Breakfast in our room, we went out for a morning of sight seeing&shopping. We arrived back at 2.30pm to change for our pre booked afternoon tea and, housekeeping had not done our room!! We had a knock on the door by a member of staff to see if it had been done and she did apologise when she could see it hadn't. It was eventually done by 4.15pm which I think is rather late. Apart from that everything was perfect. Our meal on Friday night was delicious, as was breakfast on both…"
April 2011,3rd stay,"just finished third  stay in 6 months - perfect location for visiting family who just relocated to London- great transportation links to all parts of the city-when staying in a large city I like staying in a slightly more residential area rather than a ""downtown area""-the location of the Milestone reminds my husband and myself of the upper east and west sides of Manhattan- our homes for over 35 years- easy walking distance to the V&A, Royal Albert Hall, Kings Road, Harrods and Harvey Nichols- staff is excellent and decor is lovely- beds are very comfortable and amenities top-notch- looking forward to reurn visits"
May 2011,EXCELLENT!!,"The hotel is superb, the best we've stayed in, in London, by far. Attention to detail is fantastic and it makes such a pleasant change."
April 2011,Enjoyed my stay,"I enjoyed my stay here, the staff are nice and helpful. The location is ideal for all the key sights on London. I would come again."
April 2011,Fabulous!!!,"We went up to a show at the Royal Albert Hall, having taken a train up from Devon to Paddington ... believe me, there is nowhere better to stay! Wonderful walk across Hyde Park ... this beautiful hotel is next to Hyde Park and Near Kensington Palace. The staff there could not be more welcoming or helpful, They made me feel so so relaxed ... and I am a bit of a nervous traveller. The Milestone is gorgeous ... and also very much a home from home. We had room service before leaving for our show, as we'd had a long walk and were tired. The food was superb ....  and it was so easy to walk up to the Royal Albert Hall, and back again afterwards. Stress free. Slept well, and had breakfast in our rooms ... again wonderful!! Next day we walked to the Natural History museum....   and back…"
April 2011,Simply the best hotel in London. Impeccable service!,"The Milestone is a rare gem in London. Probably the last hotel with 1st class service. From the moment you check in to the moment you check out, the Milestone staff treat you like royalty. The restaurant food is delightful. You've got to try the eggs benedict for breakfast. The Hollandaise is the best I've had.  We stayed in the Apartments and had the sweetest room with two floors and a kitchen. What treat. Also, very convenient walk to Kensington Hgh Street Tube Station."
April 2011,Best hotel I have stayed at in Europe,"From the moment we arrived until the time we left, The Milestone Hotel provided us with a wonderful guest experience.  We had a room upgrade to a lovely suite, service that was gracious but not overbearing, excellent breakfasts and delicious evening hors d'oevres brought to our room.  The l0ocation was excellent and the common rooms werer delightfully British."
April 2011,A really enjoyable and relaxing stay.,"My wife and I spent 5 nights in the Prince Albert  Suite and enjoyed the views of Kensington Gardens, extremely comfortable accommodation and impeccable and friendly service. Do eat in the restaurant, do use room service and just enjoy a relaxing time, as we did. Fantastic base for sightseeing as it is near to everything but slightly more sedate than some central locations."
April 2011,Could easily move into the Milestone Hotel,"We stayed at the Milestone after a ghastly experience at another hotel. What a pleasure it was to meet the staff at the Milestone, enjoy the beautiful lobby, and relax in our gorgeously appointed room with a view of the park. Every detail is extremely elegant and well thought-through, and the bathrooms were tastefully done with top of the line fixtures. Also, the location (right across from Hyde Park) really couldn't be beat. My many thanks to Stephanie, Neil, and the entire staff at the Milestone for making our stay so memorable."
April 2011,Wonderful from start to finish!,"My husband and I just returned from a 5 night stay at the Milestone and it was a truly wonderful experience.  I agonized over where to stay in London and we had pretty much every option, but I am so glad we chose the Milestone.  Others have written about the top notch service and I totally agree.  Our experience started as soon as we arrived in London.  We opted to have the hotel provide transportation from Heathrow.  It was a bit more expensive than a taxi but so worth it to have the delightful Colin greet us after a long flight and even take us on a little tour before taking us to the hotel.  What a great way to start our vacation.  Everyone on staff was genuinely interested in making sure we were enjoying ourselves and had everything we needed (thanks Neil, Pedro and Marcus!)…"
March 2011,A top quality hotel,"I stayed at The Milestone Hotel in Mid March for the weekend as the base for my wedding in Hammersmith along with my family and a friend.  As soon as I arrived at the hotel the staff were charming, helpful and friendly. I was lucky enough to be staying in the beautiful Regency Suite and even though I had people turning up to do our hair and makeup,  the staff didn't stop being helpful and kind. My husband and I then stayed for our wedding night and again felt spoilt and had a lovely breakfast in the suite the next morning. A beautiful hotel, in a perfect location, great staff and a personal touch.  Thank you for helping to make our wedding weekend special."
May 2010,Very english hotel in great location,"My husband and I stayed at the Milestone hotel in the summer of 2010.  The hotel's location is fabulous and we had a great time.  High Street Kensington is just a few steps away in one direction, and Knightbridge is a short taxi or bus ride in the other direction.  Hyde Park is just across the street, which was great for morning jogs.  We both lived in London for years and know the city well, and this really is a great location to stay.  The hotel itself is very charming and quaint.  The decor is very old-fashioned english, very London.  Our room was very cute, but the bathroom felt a bit too old, and our sink was partly blocked.  Service was good, but I wouldn't say it was the best we ever experienced, and I'm surprised everyone else found it so amazing.  No complaints, but…"
March 2011,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Service","Beautiful hotel, great location and very friendly helpful staff.  We stayed in this hotel as part of a wedding party and the people couldn't do enough.  The hotel and rooms were very clean and service was great.  would definitely recommend it."
March 2011,London luxury at it's best,"We stayed at the Milestone for about a week and a half this March in an Apartment which for London was extraordinarily spacious. It consisted of two bedrooms, two full bathrooms, a living room and a kitchen. It also included all the facilities of the hotel.  	Having stayed at most of the Five star properties in London throughout my life. I have found the level of service and attention to detail in both design and comfort that the Milestone provides, to be the best in London.  	They consistently keep a record of guest preferences and in my opinion have the best guest services team. They are one of the few remaining hotels that I can find that not only provides round the clock complimentary butler service but also has in-house chauffeurs at affordable rates compared to comparable…"
March 2011,"Wonderful hotel with great, personal service!","Our family recently stayed at the milestone and had two hotel rooms.  The rooms were beautifully decorated, as were all the common rooms in the hotel.  The staff were very helpful in meeting any of our needs.  The hotel is well located.  We will return!"
February 2011,Great location and service,"We stayed here for three nights over valentines weekend.  Was a fantastic stay, the location was great for getting out and about in London.  Close to knightsbridge and the museums.  The staff were fantastic from the moment we arrived, I think all hoteliers should stay here for a lesson on how it should be done!  We were upgraded to the Safari suite which we liked although I do think it may soon be in need of some refurbishment as was starting to look a little tired.  However it was large and spotlessly clean with a lovely view to Kensington Palace.  I loved the little evening treats of canapes and chocolates in the room.  Our romantic turndown was good although no music was put on.  Not quite sure why they ask for music preferences as it did not appear that music was provided so…"
March 2011,"Fantastic service, beautiful rooms, staff can't do enough for you!",I stayed in the Milestone for my sister's wedding. It was a beautiful hotel. A lovely breakfast and charming atmosphere in the bar at night time.The staff were so friendly and helpful. The service was 5 star. The best hotel I've stayed in!
March 2011,Great place to stay,Very Nice place to stay for business or leisure. Thé staf is wonderful and the service... Just perfect. Will make it again. K
February 2011,Can't wait to return to this amazing hotel,"My husband and I selected London as the destination where we wished to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary.  After much research we chose the Milestone Hotel and are so pleased that we did.  This is truly a lovely hotel with a wonderful staff.  Our entire experience greatly exceeded our expectations.  Our package included full English breakfast (very tasty and plentiful, charming and cheerful staff, cozy dining room) and private car transfer from Heathrow. Our delightful driver Colin took us on a little mini-tour before dropping us at the hotel, helping us to get our bearings.  Our lovely upgraded room was ready for us upon arrival.  On our second night at the Hotel we returned to our room after a show to find it decorated with candles and rose petals, with a bottle of…"
February 2011,Absolutely fabulous!,"My husband and I just returned after a weeklong stay at the Milestone. In a word, the experience was splendid! Let’s begin with the perfect setting – across the street from gorgeous Kensington gardens, a stones throw from the Kensington High Street stop on the Circle Line of the tube, and within walking distance to fabulous restaurants. A few words about the staff who immediately understands your wants and desires – Marcus could very well be the bartender of the year, Jim the concierge who never tires of meeting your every need, Teddy the hero who booked us a table at Il Portico where we were treated as part of the family, Neil the assistant manager who can make any guest feel at home at the Milestone. I could go on, but really you must just go and see for yourself."
February 2011,Fabulous hotel- felt totally spoilt!,"We picked this hotel after reviewing it on Tripadvisor- we were not let now! From the moment we walked in we received excellent service. We were shown around the hotel e.g. bar, dining areas, sauna etc. We were then taken to our room and shortly afterwards we received our commplimentary drinks ( which we had chosen previously on a form that they email to you). The room was lovely and we were not dissapointed- and we have stayed in 5 star htels around the world, inlcuding the Taj hotels in India.  They even went out of their way and supplied soya mlk for my husband , who is a vegan. The operations manager- Neil went out of his way to make our stay as comforatble as possible. Knowing that we were a vegetarian and vegan he even printed off details of a suitable restaurant for us. …"
February 2011,Amazing Afternoon tea - Didnt want to leave!,"The Milestone Hotel is just fabulas and you can see why its No3 currently in London. It only has 90 odd rooms so is small and personal. The moment i walk through the door the service blew me away. The lovely, lounge, bar and conservatory really made you feel at home and didnt want to leave. The Afternoon tea was cheaper than the major names of hotels but in my opinion was better. Sandwiches were nice but the scones were the best i ever tasted. Great pastries and cakes also. All items and tea were filled up as much as you wanted. Staff couldnt be faulted and cant wait to return."
January 2011,Consistently Amazing,This is our 5th or 6th stay at this wonderful gem of a hotel.  Each time we stay it is captivating.  The rooms are amazing - we've been given a different one each time - and the staff are all wonderful.  If you are visiting the Albert Hall or V&A/Science?Natural History Museum there really is nowhere better in terms of location and experience.  And of course - harrods is just up the road too!
January 2011,Outrageouse Brilliant........The best of the best,"Entering our own palace is the only way to explain the excellent hotel, The Milestone. Ebvery detail is outstanding from the brillian concierge neil who knew all the attractions and really made it his mission to find wonderful outings my 8 year old daughter would enjoy.  Besides watching the football match with her and relaying scores....The staff is exceptional the friendliness and the ability to rememebr all names and likes dislikes and prefereneces.  Teh rooms are all different so no one will have the exact room, remember thisis a historical building....an old monestery...the antiques are fantastic and it is like visiting a museum every room has a touch of hominess and charm and character.  High tea was the finest I have had....I have had many high teas around town but the…"
January 2011,Excellent!!!,"With ALL the very BEST comfort and service, in everything - in to the smallest details!!! We have travelled the world - and use to stay at the very best hotel - and this hotel was both very cozy and really nice with a lot of ""Home-feeling""!  Even before our visit - we received a ""personal wishing-list""from The Milestone -that asked us what we prefered and our choices of pillows and down-quilts, and ALL other wishes. And we did appreciate and really LOVED our cozy beatiful room - with really high comfort and a wonderful bed and a great view over the park! The service was excellent  and everything was really GREAT in to the smallest details! The staff were so KIND and wanted to full-fill every small wish we had! And even the kind breakfast-waitress knew our name, at once! We can…"
January 2011,Unique hotel with Great Location and Excellent Friendly service,"Hotel was everything we'd hoped for.All staff were very friendly and helpful.Rooms were all different and regardless of shape or size all offered the same quality. Perfect location with plenty of restaurants around the area.Excellent breakfast . We were a party of six 50 to 60 year olds, and found the only disappointment  was the dinner that evening .There was a selection from the A la Carte or Table D'ote menus.When asked if the Grills menu (which included steaks) was available we were told no.The food ,whilst good quality,was very Nouvelle Cuisine, lukewarm  and served on cold plates. One of our party chose the cod dish from the Table D'ote menu which was also very very salty (he probably should have sent it back but didn't). Whilst the restaurant itself was very pleasant and…"
January 2011,The Best service ever,"This was a birthday treat weekend for our daughter. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff who were helpful, kind and knowledgeable.  It was old fashioned service from a bygone era: discreet and helpful but not obsequious. The rooms were not huge but very, very comfortable and quiet: we looked out over Kensington gardens but didn't hear any traffic at all or any noise from other rooms. We dined in the restaurant (superb) and had a 'celebration' birthday tea - very Country House. This is not the cheapest option hotel in London but something that is perfect for a special event.  I would love to go back again."
November 2010,Words Cannot Describe...,"Absolutely beautiful hotel, a world away from my usual hectic schedule. Amazing view, amazing staff and quite literally is a small piece of heaven on earth. Made my week. Many thanks."
December 2010,Beautiful 1st Wedding anniversary stay,Very little to complain about! Apart from the rare disappearance of a doorman on our arrival everything was exactly as expected and as hoped for.  Being an Leaders' Club  member  an upgrade was offered and we were given a wonderful deluxe studio. We were initially shown around the hotel before being shown our room and the whole experience was a worthwhile luxury. Of course staying there means spending a few £££s but for that quality I don't resent it! WIll happily return.
December 2010,I feel as tho I am coming home when I get to The Milestone.,"The older staff at The Milestone are awesome, and know how to provide incredible service.  A few of the ""interns"" can look a bit lost, but there always seems to be a nice, regular staff person to step in if needed. They found us same day tickets to The War Horse.  The meals were wonderful.  Breakfast service was great and our dinner was excellent and the sommelier (Lia) brought us a lovely red she had just selected for the list. I am ready to go back!"
December 2010,Best Hotel In London,"Seriously, is there a better hotel in London?  I would find that hard to believe.  The rooms are unbelievable - they are really beautiful, clean and well-maintained.  The staff is top-notch.  Right from the minute you check in, the front desk staff, the doormen, the amazing concierge staff.  These guys know service.  The restaurant is very nice and the room they use for afternoon tea is cozy.  My wife and I keep coming back to this hotel among other reasons because we love the afternoon tea so much.    Really I can't say enough about the hotel and the service.  If you're trying to decide where to stay in London, you can stop looking now and book the Milestone."
December 2010,Perfect as always,"This is our third time back to the milestone and it once again didn't disappoint! We picked the magical London package which is great, free movies, breakfast in bed 2 days, afternoon tea, a festive turn down (my favourite as it's all about the detail) and late check out on day of departure.  We came for our anniversary, as a special treat as it's got such a great location to all the shops. When we got there we were upgraded - this has never ever happened to me ever!! Then got a glass of champagne on arrival and with breakfast.  We ate in the restaurant, again perfect service and everyone was very attentive. The starters where gorgeous and different to the standard restaurants. The wine list was vast and ranged from very affordable to beyond extravagant. My favourite thing to do…"
November 2010,A hotel to revisit,"My husband and I stayed at The Milestone at the end of November and were extremely satisfied with everything. The staff were very pleasant and helpful (the concierge booked us some very good restaurants), everything was clean and welcoming. And of course the location needs mentioning. We Will definitely stay there again."
November 2010,A Delightful Hotel,My wife and I stayed for one night and were delighted with the hotel.  We felt welcome from the moment we checked in and we could not have asked for better service throughout our stay.  Our room was very well presented and toiletries etc were of the highest quality.  It is an excellent base for The Albert Hall and we will certainly return.
November 2010,Milestone FTW,"The service is world class, the staff are friendly and very accommodating. For one night I felt like I was famous, or filthy rich of which I'm neither. We were on our 10 year anniversary and were upgraded to the Princess suite which was truly out of this world. The room was the definition of refined elegance , The walls were lined with padded fabric and the 4 post bed was so comfortable I can honestly say I had the best night’s sleep of my life, the bathroom oozed luxury and the in room services which included internet on the TV. I can't sing this hotels praises enough, you haven't stayed at a world class hotel until you've spent a night here."
December 2010,Another perfect stay in a Red Carnation Hotel,"Stayed here because it's one of the red carnation group of hotels and we'd had such a great experience with 41, also in London. Again, the staff go out of their way to provide what you need, before you know you needed it. They provide a backstage tour of the hotel for kids, we were really cheeky and brought in two extras who weren't even checked in to the hotel, (""not a problem"" said Stephanie the excellent asst. guest services manager). In fact nothing was ever a problem for any of the staff, doesn't matter whether you're just arriving or leaving, the first rate service continues. Had a beautiful meal in the restaurant while the kids were entertained with the hotel tour and room service. The kids were impressed, they didn't know they were allowed to order drinks with room…"
November 2010,Absolutely stellar,"My spouse and I stayed at the Milestone for two nights.  We were there to celebrate our anniversary and they upgraded our room, gave us a cake and champagne, lit candles, and scattered our bed with rose petals.  The concierge staff was exceptionally helpful and diligent; they even talked East Coast Rail into getting us train tickets when our credit card would not work online.  Pedro, on the bell staff, was exceptionally helpful and the doorman was always smiling.  The location is great - near both Gloucester and High Street Kensington tube stations - and is right across from Kensington Park, of which we had a view from our room.  We arrived before our room was ready after an overnight flight, and they let us use the gym facilities where we could shower and refresh ourselves. …"
December 2010,Nice Hotel  but got ripped of when i needed a taxi to the airport,"Had a great stay but it was ruined by the concierge and doorman when I asked for a taxi ti the airport. The called me a car and I was charged £68  I taught it was going to be a good old london Taxi Like the one I got in from the airport, but now it wasnt it was a smart Merc but the driver was asian and very rude and tried to con a tip out of me outt another £20 when I said I paid he said that is what we should tip, I will just use a london black cab in future much cheaper and very friendly ,you know what you get"
April 2010,A True Delight,"Stayed in this Hotel back in April was was truly amazed. Had lived for many years in London and never heard of this particular gem.  Beautiful little hotel, with  outrageously good service. Would love to say I will stay again, however I own an apartment close by so will just need to ensure my friends stay there so I can return."
June 2010,The hotel you always hoped you would find in London,"A wonderful experience from start to finish.  We loved the look of the hotel when we drove up ---it's location is ideal -- and we were greeted warmly and professionally by the front door staff and the desk.  Our room was beautifully furnished, the dining room excellent, and the facilities and features of the hotel are all superb.   It's NOT modern --- it has wonderful, authentic, old world charm, but it is beautifully maintained.   Most of all the staff was uniformly polite, thoughtful, and they simply couldn't do enough to help you have a good stay.   I don't think we'll ever stay anywhere else."
July 2010,A quaint family hotel in London. Loved it.,"If your looking for a great boutique hotel that can offer some home-like amenities, this would be your place. My younger daughter travelled with me and she was instantly greeted with the friendliest staff.  We had an apartment that provided a full kitchen and laundry.  The breakfast was seriously the best I have had in London - great pancakes and waffles.  The neighborhood offers great shopping and easy access to transportation.  I can't wait to stay there again."
July 2010,"Nice, but a bit cramped","We had two rooms at the Milestone for four nights.  The staff was helpful, graciously overlooking the fact that my daughter threw up in the lobby within an hour of our arrival, the location across from the park, great, and the sound proofing of the rooms, excellent--I didn't hear any street traffic at night.  Accustomed as I am to small European hotel rooms, I felt particularly cramped at the Milestone, however.  There wasn't  space for two carry-on suit cases in the room and room service had to be eaten on a tray on the bed.  I prefer a bit more space.  We ate breakfast, which was very good, in our rooms because the dining room was quite small and we usually had to wait for a table."
July 2010,This hotel provided the best service we have experienced in many years.,"Not only was the service excellent, but the employees were so outgoing and friendly. One could tell the employees enjoyed their jobs and it showed in their contact with the customers (hotel guests). This certainly is a reflection of good management, selection of good emploees and proper training."
July 2010,First class hotel and excellent service,"I travel all over he world on business and at times have had to put up with some rather indifferent hotel rooms and service. However, the Milestone hotel in Kennsington, London was really quite special and for me, set a new standard in 5* treatment. The management team really seemed to appreciate the guest. The staff, room/food quality and overall location of the hotel was really excellent. Although it is a boutique hotel, the standards are extremely high and I will now always say there when travelling to London. Highly recommended."
June 2010,Treat Yourself To This Hotel,"We booked two nights at this hotel as it is an easy walk to the Albert Hall. This a small boutique hotel where you can feel safe and pampered. Our room, the African Suite had a safari theme which was delightful. The bed enormous, comfortable and the sheets to die for.  The room was a generous size and the service just right.    It was quite warm when we were there and so we appreciated the airconditioning. Wifi is available in the room.  Fresh fruit was waiting for us on arrival, small pieces of fruit and each one perfect. The breakfast is the best I have experienced in a hotel and I just wished I had enough money to move in permanently and have breakfast here every day of my life. I though the breakfasts in Manhattan were good but they still have something to learn from the…"
July 2010,I'm homesick for the Milestone,"I only stayed a week but made myself right at home.  The room was absolutely spotless however I would have enjoyed a better view. Upon request they changed the mattress to make it softer and gave me THE most comfortable pillow.  The bathroom literally sparkled.  While waiting for a taxi, the room maid waved hi to me and gave me the friendliest hello like she was my friend. Fiona at the spa is a doll and made me feel special and welcome. Location is amazing; Whole Foods and the Tube are a few steps away.  The hardworking Concierge got me all the theater tickets I wanted and knew the best restaurants in town; they were even able to get me reservations last minute.  One gentleman took the time to hand draw me a map, highlighted in yellow and everything to ensure I made it to my…"
December 2009,Fantastic Hotel,"I have stayed in the Milestone on three occasions,  twice on business and once with my young family.  The staff and service are unbeatable and made us feel very welcome.  Nothing is too much trouble and would recommend this hotel to anyone."
July 2010,great hotel!,"We stayed here for 2 nights following a Backroads cycling trip in Tuscany. My travel agent, recommended it. The hotel and hotel staff were awesome.  Comfy beds, large suite (we were upgraded, i have no idea why unless it was the AmEx platinum), clean, all sorts of useful items in the room like a normal blow dryer, scissors, tape etc...They brought snacks in the late afternoon, cold water, cookie or something sweet at night.  The concierge, who I had been emailing with for weeks before was great as well. Good location. We will stay here the next time we are in London."
December 2009,"Great staff, small rooms","The only thing that makes this hotel stand out from all the other small hotels in London is the great staff, other than that, it is simply another small hotel, with small rooms, charging huge prices.  It is overpriced for what it delivers, but many London hotels are in the same category.  Another positive is its good location, but then that shouldn't be a reason to overcharge for the level or quality of its rooms.  I would only stay again for an overnighter."
September 2010,Simply Sublime,"I just returned from a weeks stay at the Milestone.  I cannot say enough about the level of warmth and hospitality displayed by the staff there.  We frequently stay at top tier hotels around the world and have not seen the consistency of good service that we received.  In particular, Neil our primary Concierge was brilliant. Before our arrival he emailed me with a great list of recommended restaurants.  He got us outstanding tickets to see a play and also made all of our daily activities easier with help from his local knowledge. A great sense of urgency and dry sense humor made him seem like part of the family. We were upgraded (thank you Platinum Amex) to the Tudor suite.  The room was large and opulent. Every day we received some sort of goodies like fresh fruit, champagne,…"
September 2010,"Incredible and beautiful hotel, impeccable services and amenities, great location and superior comfort","The Milestone Hotel is simply incredible.  From the day we contacted Doris to book an apartment almost a year prior to our sta, thru correspondence back and forth with her to select our apartment, thru the impeccable services that Jim, Neil, Patrick and others provided during our stay, this is one of the finest hotels we have every stayed in, period.  The concierge and front desk team were right on with all of their recommendations about tourist sites, restaurants, travel and logistics and other things throughout our stay.  Although the individual rooms are also beautiful and comfortable, if you are traveling with two couples or a small family, we would strongly recommend that you consider renting one of the 2 bedroom apartments which are part of the hotel, which usually include…"
September 2010,Simply the Best Hotel in London,"If you want service -- I mean REAL service -- stay at this hotel.  We've stayed there twice in three months.  It is simply the best hotel in London and on the world's top ten of hotels in the world.  We've stayed at many hotels around the world:  they could all learn something from The Milestone -- and these hotels I'm talking about include Four Seasons, Ritz Carltons, Raffles and other high end chains.  Not much more I can say.  Try it."
September 2010,Outstanding Service,"We stayed here for two nights to do some shopping in Knightsbridge. The service is second to none. From the concierges who take your luggage to your room and park the car to the restaurant / bar staff who will provide anything you could want, this is a place of outstanding, friendly service. The rooms are exactly as they should be, clean, comfortable,quiet etc. This was our third stay here and we would not consider staying at any other London hotel. The situation is perfect for the Albert Hall, Kensington Palace is opposite, the V&A is a short walk away as is the Science Museum, Harrods , Harvey Nicholls etc. Wonderful, relaxing place."
September 2010,Timeless elegance and warmth of a country home in the city,"The Milestone Hotel is an experience if one is seeking that home welcoming atmosphere as well as the best service and accommodations. The rooms are very unique,elegantly arranged and spotless. If you appreciate art as I do, you can tour the floors and admire the timeless art work and antique arrangements. The afternoon tea service is a must experience that will transport you back to the Era of Elegance and the Golden Age of beauty and refinement. I enjoyed every aspect of The Milestone Hotel and recommend that you experience the atmosphere for yourself."
August 2010,WHEN CAN WE COME BACK !!!,"We just returned from the most amazing hotel we have ever stayed in and we have been at many...We decided to spend a week post cruise ( Aug 23-28 2010) in London at the Milestone Hotel and we couldn't have chosen a more perfect ending to a trip of a life time celebrating our 35th wedding anniversary..From the moment we arrived we were overwhelmed by the beautiful exterior and interior of this hotel..The entire hotel staff was so warm and welcoming and definitely set the tone for our entire five night stay..Nothing escaped their eye for detail..From the tour of the hotel and introduction to all the staff to the cocktails and sweets as we entered our room..We loved the location,size and view from of our deluxe king room #504..After returning that first evening from a bit of…"
August 2010,Looking forward to my next trip!,We would like to thank all the staff at the Milestone Hotel.  They made our trip one to remember.  The food was some of the best that i've had and it was always served to us with a smile. Our room was cleaned to perfection with the outstanding views over Kensington Park.  I would like to say a special thank you to the front of house team who were so helpful and gave me so much information for this beautiful city.  I am looking forward to my next visit already!
September 2010,"Overpriced and Overrated, With Poor Maintenance","First, it is obvious that many travelers automatically give this a 5 star rating...some sort of group-think behavior must be at work here. This is not a service to one's fellow travelers; rather, it provides no real information.  I don't appreciate these kinds of rah rah rah reviews that just rave about a hotel, yet provide no balanced information.  Perhaps the people are not experienced travelers; some might call them gullible. So, here I will present an accurate review without the fluff!  This is a small, boutique hotel located in the Kensington South area of London.  It is well located with easy access to London sites.  However, it provides very small rooms for an inflated price. For example, our ""Deluxe Studio"" was so cramped we kept tripping over our suitcases, received…"
August 2010,Very good small luxury hotel,"Stayed one night over the August Bank Holiday.  Parking was straightforward and we managed to park right outside the hotel on a single yellow.  Receptionist was professional and friendly, although she tried to ""up"" sell me a better room which I never like and felt this tactic was a little cheap - if I want a better room I'll book one!  We were escorted around the hotel by a really nice gent.  The hotels public rooms, although small are lovely.  The bar and conservatory were particularly nice.  We had a welcome glass of Champagne, which was complimentary; and the nibbles were great.  We purposefully booked the basic double as we were not planning on staying in the room for the weekend.  The room was tasteful and the quality perfect.  Lovely fabric wallpaper and all of the…"
October 2010,Van and the Milestone a great combination,My partner arranged for us to see Van Morrison at the Royal Albert Hall. As the Milestone was close by and after seeing the other reviews we decided to stay there. We had a wonderful stay and the staff were very attentive and the room was lovely. Van was also great as always and next time he comes to the Royal Albert we are sure to stay at the Milestone.
November 2010,Top notch service from friendly staff,"Five of us stayed in an apartment for a week that had 2 bedrooms, 2.5 baths and a kitchen.  While still tight compared to American hotels, it was quite large compared to other alternatives we explored in London.  It was very well appointed, comfortable beds and clean.  Staff was exceptional with all very friendly and helpful.  The apartment was immaculate and was nicely appointed.  We would wholeheartedly recommend the Milestone and would definitely return there."
October 2010,Great Hotel in a great location,My wife and I came to London for 2 nights to see Van Morisson at The Royal Albert Hall and were recommended to stay at The Milestone as it was close by. We had a great stay. The room we had was beautiful and spacious and the little touches with the service they provide puts this hotel at the top of my list !!  We will be returning soon.
September 2010,The best hotel in London  ??,"We took our 13 year old Grand-daughter to London for 2 days. The Milestone was perfectly situated - we walked through the park to Buckingham Palace and went to the Royal Mews - then over to Kensington High St for Tea - back to the Hotel to change for the Last Night of the Proms,to which we walked,at the Royal Albert Hall.   Every time we went back to the Hotel the staff greeted us by name On arrival we had been upgraded from the standard room that we had booked to a fantastic suite ,with an adjoining sideroom for our Grand-daughter.Drinks and canapes arrived early evening and Ellie kept texting messages and pictures to her Parents and siblings. Wonderful rooms, incredible location and very special staff  -  we would reommend this hotel to you all."
October 2010,A small hotel with outstanding staff and amenities,"The Milestone has less than 60 rooms but what it lacks in size it makes up for in terms of accommodations and a superb staff.  Each room is decorated differently and all are wonderful.  The amenities for the room are outstanding.  The staff is most attentive and extraordinarily helpful.  At every level the service is as good as can be imagined.  Location in the Kensington area is excellent, with transportation and dining nearby.  All in all, the hotel is a jewel and worth a stay for anyone."
April 2010,Afternoon tea,"I arranged a surprise high tea for my Daughters Birthday. We had the conservatory for our party.This was ideal as we had a baby with us. The deco was excellent, the food and the service was superb.  Individual attention was given to our party and we felt so relax and felt very comfortable.  My daughter enjoyed her 30th Birthday surprise very much .  Thank you and your staff  for a very enjoyable afternoon"
April 2010,Excellent afternoon tea,I was given a nice surpise by my family for afternoon tea for my birthday. I was greeted at the front door and taken through to the conservatory where my family were waiting. The setting was spectacular and the service was impeccable. I was treated to a beautiful birthday cake made by the hotel which really topped my whole day off. I could not fault it!
October 2010,Wonderful hotel !!!,"Nice staff, great location, good restaurant. We hope to come back ....."
August 2010,We thought we heard john lennon!,"We heard ""love is a stranger"" by Brahman Kelleher, and i swear it reminded my of a johnny cash meets john lennon!  This hotel rocks! I like hotels who cater to a discerning ear! Service was top notch, a spot on value!  Highly recommended!"
November 2009,"Elegant, intimate, beautiful....","This is a beautiful luxury small hotel right in front of Kensington Palace with views over the park and 3 minutes from Kensington High Street. Excellent, discreet, personalised service and smiles from all the members of staff. Superb restaurant with knowledgeable wine waiter. The rooms are beautifully maintained and spotlessly clean. We have stayed here  twice and loved it. Definitely to be recommended."
April 2010,5 star service and comfort,"My Wife has just returned from a 2 night stay at this hotel with our daughter, from check in to check out She was delighted with the service and quality, we have stayed at no41 previous which is just as good, My Wife will return soon with our other daughter to enjoy all that London and this hotel has to offer, many thanks to all the staff at the Milestone for looking after them and making it a special stay."
April 2010,"Great service, problems with breakfast","Fantastic staff on reception and throughout the hotel. All rooms offer a different theme. We had the Jungle Room which had a balcony. Very clean and comfortable, but bed wasn't huge. Stayed in for dinner in the restaurant which was exceptional. Breakfast was not as good though. There were 10 of us and only one member of staff so some of food was cold and the staff member smelled strongly of b.o. Not pleasent but overall enjoyed the stay."
March 2010,Best Hotel Ever,"Shame about the review below about the apartment but you have to say as you find and my wife and I found this hotel to be one of the best we have ever stayed in. On arrival, Terry made us feel like royalty throughout the one night stay we had (Shame he's retiring in July!). Showing us round was a great touch but its' the little things that make it so special - lighting a candle in the bathroom for when we got back, a little history book on chocolate, complimentary drink on arrival, the list is endless. The cooked breakfast was wonderful and served with a smile. We were watching a show at the Royal Albert Hall, so it was perfectly postioned. This part of London is quite upmarket but we will DEFINETELY be coming back here when we come back to London. Thanks really to all the staff…"
March 2010,disappointing,"We were coming to London, read the reviews on Tripadvisor recommending this hotel and decided to splurge.  The apartments photos looked lovely and most of the reviews were very enthusiastic.  And since we were coming for 23 days we wanted to be comfortable, with the convenience of a kitchen.  I had pictured having our friends over, for drinks, a bite to eat.  No way that could happen.  We wouldn't have been able to fit.  And I'm not talking about hordes.  I'm talking about two more people for an hour or so.    We were disappointed, to say the least.    They put up in apartment 6, up in the attic, a little rabbit warren of a place, which was hard enough for me, having to make my way around the living room with my head cricked at a slant, and couldn't sit at the kitchen table…"
February 2010,I feel sorry for those people who never get to stay here!,"This is how I would run a hotel, there was nothing that could have improved our stay. I was a bit worried because I wondered if it would be stuffy and I would feel uncomfortable - this could not have been further from the truth. From the minute we arrived we felt special and genuinely valued and wanted as guests, I think I only said my name upon check in and then every member of staff knew who we were - amazing. The little touches made the whole stay really special and I feel myself welling up thinking about the amount of times I was wowed. I wont go in to much detail as it will spoil it for future guests but I would be shocked if anyone gave less than a rave review. The personal touch is what we have lost these days as we go about our daily business and do we really listen to…"
March 2010,as good as it gets,"My family and I had the pleasure of a four night stay at the Milestone in March of 2010.  We book through American Express when possible.  The agent steered us to a hotel down the street, and upon arrival, we figured it made sense to check out the Milestone, which was my wife's first choice.    From the moment we set foot in the hotel, the staff treated us with courtesy and respect.  We were given a tour of the property and quickly decided to retrieve our belongings from the other property and check in for the duration of our stay.  We chose a suite with two levels.  The room was beautifully decorated, exceedingly clean, and comfortable.   The upstairs room had a sofa bed, television, small pool table, and half bath. Perfect in all respects.  The bathroom was roomy and elegant. …"
September 2009,Simply class.,"Stayed last year at this hotel although not sure exactly when! Been meaning to write a review for sometime.  Ok you know as soon as you walk into the hotel its a different level as your greeted by name. Very friendly gentleman showed us around the hotel which is always nice particularly as the Milestone seems to have some history. Once we were shown to our room it was made clear that if we needed anything no matter what then please ask, even if it meant a room service item or meal that wasnt on the menu. Room was very comfortable if slightly small although i think we may of just got a little unlucky with that. I liked the location of the Hotel. Turn right and have a nice stroll down the road and you will be in the middle of the main shopping areas harrods etc. Concierge were…"
March 2010,The Milestone is PERFECT!,"I have stayed at five star hotels all over the world and The Milestone is really at the top of my list!  I did extensive research prior to my stay and landed on the Milestone.   I was more than pleased and could not have been any happier with every aspect of this hotel.  Upon check-in, I was given a tour of the hotel and all the amenities by the hotel butler.  In addition, we were offered a complimentary drink at the hotel bar while the room was being prepared (we arrived early).   In about 15 mins, the room was ready and the butler showed us to the room.  I purchased a king room and it was very nice.   That being said, the butler indicated that the hotel was not full and that upgrades were available if we were interested.   They showed us to a suite and offered it to us for…"
April 2008,In Love With The Milestone,"My husband and I were in London for a spring wedding, and for this particular visit, we chose to stay at the Milestone. It has had tons of buzz in the travel industry and every client I sent there myself came back with rave reviews. Having stayed at many of London's top hotels, I had high expectations and the Milestone blew me away. Our room was upgraded at no extra cost, and it was an upgrade like none I have ever had before. Our suite was hidden behind a fake bookcase and our room was bi-level with a spiral staircase and a sprawling balcony overlooking Kensington Park. The decor was tasteful and welcoming with warm colors and a spread of books for us to enjoy. On the top level, the walls had been painted to look like an antique library full of books and there was a snooker…"
February 2010,Marvelous Boutique Hotel,"I spent four nights here with my young daughter.  This hotel is splendid.  I can see why it has such high TripAdvisor ratings.  First of all, the decor is WONDERFUL.  This is a Victorian building that has been lovingly renovated in the full-on English ""we love patterns"" sort of way.  If you need Japanese zen decor to relax, don't stay here.  But if you want to feel like you are in England, and you enjoy elegant & cozy decor with lots of throw pillows and warm fires and cozy nooks and fresh flowers, you will love it here.  We stayed in the Viscount Suite (a junior suite), which was gorgeous and overlooked Hyde Park.  What is really special about this hotel is all the thoughtful details they put in your room.  The room desk, for example, is stocked like your desk at home--it even…"
August 2009,"Great hotel, but niggly problems","First of all this is a stunning hotel in a great location for Kensington, Knightsbridge and Notting Hill for retail therapy and relaxing. Very attentive staff who are really friendly. The rooms are a little small - or should I say, there was a lot of furniture crammed in to our room.  However, lack of a functioning TV (it had to be repaired twice in a four day stay), an unstable wireless set-up was a small price to pay for an unbelievable trip to London."
August 2009,wonderful small hotel in perfect location,"Our first time in London...this hotel was recommended by travel agent. Lovely hotel! We stayed a week in an apartment...my recommendation if you have a family. We loved having the extra room and my kids(18 & 11) had their own rooms. 2 bathrooms also which is a HUGE plus! Perfect location without car. Bus stop was right across the street and tube station is a short walk down the street. Staff is top notch!! Ask and you shall receive...and I'm not kidding about that!! If you are an avid runner or walker, you will love Kensington Park right across the street. We had a fantastic time in London!"
July 2009,Wonderful service perfect stay with our four legged friend!,"Cant fault the service we recieved at this hotel,great location,attention to detail,best hotel we have stayed at with or without our Maggie dog.Perfect in every way."
August 2009,Absolutely Fantastic - It's all in the attention to detail.,"My wife and I arranged a one night stay at the Milestone Hotel for our Anniversary.  We arrived late afternoon to what was an emaculate Hotel with the highest level of service I have ever encountered.  The friendly staff were only a phone call away - nothing was too much trouble and we were made to feel like absolute royalty.  We ate in their restaurant that evening before going out to the theatre.  It was quiet, relaxing and the waiter service was extremely professional, polite and very friendly.  The breakfast was beautifully presented and equally tasty - loved the sausages!  The room itself was emmaculate, very spacious and the maid service's attention to every detail reaffirmed the feeling of royalty.  I have never stayed anywhere like the Milestone before I doubt highly…"
July 2009,"Dynamite experience, highly recommend!",We stayed at the Milestone Hotel during a resent trip to Europe. It was an unparallel hotel experience! The Milestone is in a prime location overlooking the park. They thought of everything down to fresh fruit delived to our room daily. We had afternoon tea on our private balcany. If you want to live like a prince this is the place to do it!
May 2006,The best in the world,"I could write a book about how much I enjoyed my stay at The Milestone.  But instead, I'll just say this:  I travel a lot for work, all over the world, and The Milestone is simply the best I have experienced in the world.  The service, the rooms, the location -- unbeatable.  Well worth it!"
June 2009,The finest service I have ever experienced,"We stayed at the MIlestone for 6 days following a Mediterranean cruise. From the moment our car dropped us at the hotel, until the morning we left, we could not find fault with anything about this great hotel. Pedro and Abdi. whose vocation in life seems to be to ensure that guests at their hotel are relieved of stress completely, were attentive in the most professional way imaginable, friendly but not too much, informative but to just the right degree. These guys have been doing this a long time! The front desk was responsive. courteous, and on the ball. They knew exactly the  status of our room, and offered us an upgrade to a suite that was as elegant as could be( admittedly, they asked us if we would be willing to pay a little extrs for this -- it was worth every penny). I…"
June 2006,one of the top five hotels in london,"i'll cut it short...great ambience hotel,the perfect example of an old style english accomodation in a fantastic city like london!"
August 2009,Way overrated and an obsequious and annoying attempt at good service,"We spent two nights at the Milestone, at the end of a European trip.  We were drawn to the hotel by its location and the sterling reviews we read on Trip Advisor, to say nothing of the Conde Naste Traveller awards, etc that the hotel has received.  The location is indeed perfect, across the road from Hyde Park and Kensington Palace.  The building itself is charming, a beautiful old brick house converted to a hotel.  The hotel prides itself (and promotes itself) as service oriented, but therein lies the rub.  It is one thing to have good service, it is quite another to have service that is obsequious and annoying, to the point of being nearly childish.  Somehow, the hotel management got it into their heads that presenting a cartoon version of Merry Old England, would appeal to…"
July 2009,Wonderful location for kids,"We spent a few nights at The Milestone and loved every minute of it.  The location is great -- right across the street from Kensington Gardens, which is so nice if you have kids who need some air.   It's close to the Princess Diana playground, Whole Foods, Le Pain Quotidien, and the Tube.  The staff were so kind and extremely helpful.  We immediately felt welcome.  Will definitely come back."
October 2007,The penultimate in hotel experiences,"My wife and I stayed in the Safari Suite on the layover on our trip home to LA from our African Safari.  From the minute when the hotel's Range Rover picked us up at Heathrow, we felt we were royalty.  The hotel accepted our extra luggage shipped from the states with our  evening clothes so we would not have to carry them all through the bush: they got us tickets to a West End show, arranged lunch at the British Museum Cafe, dinner reservations each night we were there.  The hotel restaurant was wonderful!  The little extra amenities, including tea every afternoon and the minibar selections were unsurpassed.  I have stayed at Four Seasons, Wyndham, Klimpton, Intercontinental, Chateau & Relais, and numerous other boutique and five star hotels, and I must say outside of some of…"
January 2009,Perfect 40th Birthday Party and Overnight Stay,"On the 24th of January this year (2009) I celebrated my 40th birthday at The Milestone Hotel with a private dinner for 34 people in the Windsor Suite. My Husband and I and our respective parents (as well as a few of the guests) also spent the night. We were given the Mistinguet Suite which has to be one of the most memorable rooms I have ever stayed in in a hotel. All in all the experience was fantastic.  From the initial booking and planning stage to the night itself, everything ran smoothly and was professionally coordianted by Stefan Otto, the F&B Manager. On the night itself, The Windsor Suite looked wonderful and the staff were fantastic – their attention to detail and their service were unsurpassable.   All our guests commented on the delicious food saying that the lamb…"
March 2009,just perfect.....exactly what we needed,"my wife and i were planning on a romantic weeekend getaway in London, we decided to stay in a beauitfully themed hotel, somewhere with individuallity, a certain special character... and i have to say i made the best decision in staying at the Milestone. our room overlooked the park, the theme was the Saville Row, beautiful and cosy, warm...breakfast was delicious and tasty, the fireplace by the lobby was extremely cosy. I have to admit i didnt praise the staff, because they deserve a salute, helpful, kind and always smiling, which added a nice personal touch to our stay. To be honest i think this is the hotel for me in london...  my advice.... ""stay at the Milestone"""
February 2009,Review of The Milestone Hotel,"The Milestone Hotel is my London home away from home.   I stay there each time I visit London for business.   It is such a lovely, traditional hotel.  I am treated with such warmth and grace from each and every member of staff and management, who know me by name.  The service is impeccable.  The Restaurants and Tea settings are intimate with old world service and attention.   The rooms are beautifully kept and updated with fresh fabrics and unique interior designs.  The facilities are just right.  I cannot rave enough about this fine hotel experience.    Sandra from Newport, Rhode Island"
January 2009,a totally amazing place to be,"From the moment we arrived at the door we were made to feel most welcome.  Everyone we encountered seemed to be working to make our stay perfect.  From the beautiful decor to the little treats and personal touches it was wonderful.  The room we had was stunning, large and comfortable.  The restaurant was fantastic and the bar and public areas very elegant.  The hotel is ideally situated for the Albert Hall, V&A, Natural History, Science Museums."
March 2009,Perfection.,"On a recent trip to London, I had the opportunity to stay at the Milestone for 3 wonderful evenings. I have never been more wowed by a property's staff, level of service or uniqueness. So, my review doesn't go on and on, I'll list what I felt were the highlights.  1.) From my corner room on the 4th floor (407), I had perfect views of Kensington Palace and surrounding park. 2.) When I arrived jetlagged but in a hurry to get to my next appointment, I took all of my things out of my bag and laid them on my bed as I didn't have time to hang them. When I returned even more tired, all of my things were hung in the closet for me.  3.) That evening, I called for a wakeup call and was greeted with ""would you like coffee with that"". Are you kidding - coffee WITH my wakeup call - that's a…"
February 2009,Outstanding in every respect,"From the moment we arrived at the Milestone Hotel, we were treated like royalty! The service we received from every single member of staff was outstanding. Nothing was too much trouble. The room was immaculate and had everything you could possibly need during your stay. The leisure facilities were also first class.  We chose to eat in Chenestons, the hotel restaurant, and the meal was amazing. We were introduced to a new wine which complimented every course perfectly."
January 2009,Pure luxury,From the moment we walked into the hotel we were treated like the only people in the world. Nothing was too much trouble. A very special place to stay. I had a massage on the morning I was due to leave. I needed somewhere to shower and change and my room had already been vacated. The staff found me a second room ( fully prepared for another guest) and allowed me to use it at no extra charge. Real old fasioned service. Thank you.
December 2008,the magical Milestone!,"The Milestone makes staying in London a pleasure. The hotel is wonderfully situated opposite Kensington Palace and well placed for Kensington High Street and a short trip from the West End etc.  The Milestone Staff are quite exceptional. Stephan in the restaurant is amazing - ask him for recommendations and prepared to be entertained!  The bar is very cosy and offers some amazing cocktails and twists on classic drinks. You'll not want for much when it comes to food or drink.  The service is exceptional.  My daughter left her hair straighteners at home (major challenge when you're a teen) so she asked if the hotel had any. Ten minutes later a brand new set arrived, no fuss, no additional comment that they had to buy them - just happy to help.  The Milestone is magic if you are in…"
January 2009,Outstanding Stay,"We recently enjoyed a wonderful 3 night stay at the Milestone.  The hotel is perfectly situated in Kensington, near many attractions.  Upon arrival, we were immediately upgraded to a fantastic suite overlooking Kensington Gardens across the street.  The staff was terrific from doorman to GM (who surprised us with two last minute tickets to Cirque du Soleil at the nearby Royal Albert Hall).  The breakfasts were excellent, as was the one dinner we had at Cheneston's.  I would definitely recommend and come back to on my next visit to London."
January 2009,Treat yourseld to a stay at this fab hotel,"We had the pleasure of staying at The Milestone last Saturday (24-01-09)  Without exception every member of staff that we encountered was courteous, polite and keen to ensure that we enjoyed our stay at the hotel.  We have already recommended the hotel to friends and would have no hesitation in re-booking the next time we stay in London."
January 2009,Le Cirque Package,"Had a great stay at The Milestone. There is a huge choice of luxury hotels and suites in West London, so for one to be voted by Conde Naste Traveller number one for service we thought it worth trying. The service, as expected was great. The staff were fantastic.  The best thing by far though was the ""package"" they put together for Cirque du Soleil at the Albert Hall.  Programme in your suite, Pre theatre meal, Bentley transfers Post theatre coffee and cognacs  5* hotel 5* package 3* prices. Great value"
January 2009,Treated Like Royalty,"My husband and I wish to express our thanks to the Management and Staff of the Milestone hotel and of  the Cheneston Restaurant for the warm welcome we received from all concerned. The food was delectable and the service impeccable.  Every member of staff whom we met was charming and helpful and all congratulated us on reaching our Golden Wedding Anniversary. It delighted us that the hotel where we spent our honeymoon fifty years ago should go to such pains to make our stay so special. For me in particular it was a joyous experience which I will remember always. I am certain my husband feels the same.   Thank you all,  Very Sincerely,  Sylvia A. Carruthers  (Mrs D. Carruthers)."
January 2009,Outstanding hotel,"I stay in London regularly on business and for pleasure.  I have used a wide range of hotels, mostly five star, including the Hilton Waldorf, the Grosvenor and Claridges.  The Milestone experience surpassed all of those in all respects.  The room was excellent, well thought out, and well equipped, right down to small items like scissors.  The decor was excellent, and, unlike so many large city hotels, showed no sign of age whatsoever.  The restaurant was superb, and a lovely size to maintain intimacy.  But like many places the experience depends on the staff, and here they are faultless.  Everyone was welcoming, helpful, friendly and knowledgeable.  It really was true that you felt like one of the family.  I will be returning, and it is unlikely now that I will use any other…"
August 2008,"The Milestone- Luxury, Intimacy and Character",One of my favourite boutique hotels in London. If you fancy a splurge get one of their suite rooms with the four poster beds. It feels like you are in genteel English country house. Great room design and bathrooms in a beautiful townhouse. Good service too.   Please note it is not a huge 5 star hotel so if that is what you are used to it may not suit. It is an old building with creaky floors and lots of character- and big on luxury.  The location is great next to Kensington Park. Make sure to walk up the Kensington Gardens road entered alongside the Garden Court Hotel (it looks closed to the public but in actual fact its only to non-authorised cars. Very interesting mansions and ambassadorial residences (including the most expensive house ever sold - to Lakshmi Mittal- prior to…
December 2008,Excellent,"We have stayed in many hotels in  London but this one has got to be the best. What more can I say it was excellent in every way especially the very freindly professional staff, will definatly stay here again."
November 2008,Impeccable Experience at the Milestone,"I have waited a bit to write this review, because I wanted all of my thoughts about The Milestone to synthesize before I merely gushed ceaselessly.  Having travelled and stayed in every major ""brand"" luxury hotel, e.g., Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, St. Regis, etc., I have never had as uniformly wonderful experience as we enjoyed at The Milestone.  First, we were upgraded to a Master Suite as an absolute surprise.  We did not ask for an upgrade, and we did not expect an upgrade.  A tremendous first impression.  Second, one expects at 500 pound plus per night that the staff will be courteous, welcoming, and helpful. However, the staff at The Milestone, from reception, the concierge staff, the butler staff, the dining room staff, to housekeeping was exceptional.  Each knew the name…"
November 2008,Excellent,"Just returned from a short overnight stay at the Milestone Hotel London.  I must say how friendly, helpful and efficient the staff were. My husband had surprised me with a theatre trip and an overnight stay in London for my birthday. We had a great time made extra nice by the hotel staff.  We were met on our arrival by a man called Terry who was very helpful, who showed us all around the hotel. Our room was lovely, immaculate, spacious and comfortable. We had breakfast in the restuarant which I must say the scrambled egg was the best I had ever tasted!! Again the staff were brilliant. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting quality and comfort with a great atmosphere. I would certainly return in the future."
October 2008,Loved Apartment One,"Everything was exactly as described on the hotel website. Wonderful accomodations and fantastic service. I can't speak highly enough of the friendly and helpful staff. It really did feel like our own home during our stay. The private entrance was especially appreciated and the location of the hotel really made us feel safe. We stayed for 10 nights and after a day full of sight-seeing and walking, it was a true pleasure to walk through the door and relax in front of the fireplace. We spent three days in Paris and the hotel was gracious enough to keep a huge piece of luggage for us so we didn't need to mail it back early. This was our first trip to London and I spent three weeks researching hotels before deciding on the Milestone. I wouldn't consider staying anywhere else on my…"
September 2008,A charming and cozy hotel!,"Wonderful hotel, great room, very comfortable bed, super room ameniities, good breakfast and outstanding service. Great massage at the spa!"
August 2008,Wonderful!,"We stayed here for 4 days precruise in early August.  It was really one of the best hotel experiences we have had anywhere (and we travel  quite a bit).  We arrived early and were not only allowed to check in but were upgraded to the fabulous Safari Suite. The attention to detail from all the staff is over the top,  I am amazed that anyone would give this beautiful hotel 3 stars!  The breakfasts were divine and the high tea quite an experience for SoCal folks.  NO request was to small to be handled promptly and with grace, We did not have dinner or a drink in the bar (although it was very charming).  The area is close to the tube, various museums, Hyde Park, Kensington Palace (across the street). Lots of shopping in the neighborhood.    We did a very nice package on Luxury Link…"
May 2008,The Best Hotel I Have Stayed In . . .By A Mile!!!,"This hotel had my boyfiend and I so impressed, we still talk about it! We had a concert at the Royal Albert Hall wich was a 5 minute walk from the hotel (it's situated on the same road!!) and with the perfect position, opposite the park it was iddylic.  From the moment we arrived we had a warm greeting and noticed all of the fresh, signiture red carnations. They were in the lift, our room, on the room service trays and in every member of staff's button holes. Lovely touch.  Our room was split level on the second floor and was very cosy. All the little 'extras' you could imagine putting into a room, they did. Stationery, slippers, extra towels and the smelly's were gorgeous.  We only spent one night here, didn't see the bar or use the restaurant or pool but we did order room…"
August 2008,WOW,"Oh WOW!!!!  My partner booked this as a surprise.  We stayed in a fabulous room with a four poster bed and a wonderfully luxurious feel. (I think it was the Tudor suite?)  I almost wished it were winter so we could have lit the fire and sat in the snug area!  Terry the butler was a great guide to the hotel and the local area. He was entertaining as well as informative.    We went down to the bar for pre-dinner drinks, Daniel the barman was so welcoming and Stephan offered us Champagne ""It's Champagne day every day at the Milestone!!"" .... Just fantastic and lovely nibbles, I would have been happy to have stayed in the bar all night.      Dinner in Cheneston's was a wonderful experience, what a lovely setting.  I have never felt so important and special, and not just how my…"
August 2008,Not a five star hotel,"I really don't know who writes these reviews. I have been to many hotels around the world and this is certainly not a five star hotel!  First of all when we entered the hotel, the floor was squeaking, first time for me in the hotel experience. When we entered our room I gave the man who accompanied us a big tip and told him to empty the mini-bar which he promised to do but didn’t, in fact I never saw him again during our stay.  The room was very small for the price we paid which was 550$ a night! and seeing that this hotel is very small by itself I don’t know how it got a five start rating! Maybe a five star in the small hotel category.  The curtains and the bed covering all smelled nasty like they never been washed before and when I tried to take a shower, the shower head fell…"
July 2008,Superb Hotel,"I stayed at the Milestone with my sister last month as a birthaday treat to coincide with a matinee trip to the theatre.  I never imagined that it would be the highlight of the trip.The room was outstanding and was much larger than I had expected and over looked Kensington Palace which thrilled us. Neil on reception was efficient and courteous, and ordered us a tray of tea to be sent to the room, complete with delicious cookies, by a lovely chap called Paul.We decided on an early supper  then bed but this didn,t go as planned as we had such a good time. We ate at about 8pm and had Chicken Pot Pie and Chopped Aberdeen Angus steak and they were outstanding . We'd had nibbles in the bar served to us by a lovely guy (maresh?) and we glad we hadn,t ordered a starter. The wine waiter…"
August 2008,The most outstanding Hotel in the UK,"This hotel is fabulous, the location, the rooms and the food. But the service is first class. Terry the butler made our stay so special and Gavin on concierge went out of his way to arrange a personal itinerary so we got to see all the sights of this great city. Everyone made our trip to London very special - we were treated like royalty. Their afternoon tea is the best in London. We will definitely go back."
August 2008,Superb!!,"Stayed at the Milestone in August and had the best experience for  a very long time. We travel frequently and visit London often and wanted to try the Milestone. The location is fantastic, right in the middle of Kensington and overlooking the beautiful Kensington Gardens. We arrived and the first thing you notice is how wonderful the staff are, they are genuinely friendly and seemed to really care about us. From the doorman to the gentleman who gave us a guided tour and offered us a complimentary glass of champagne,  to the ladies who serviced our room, everyone just couldn't do enough for us. Our room was beautifully decorated, I believe newly refurbished as well,  room 502 with a lovely four poster bed. The room was spotlessly clean and the evening turn down service was superb…"
June 2008,OK - friendly but not efficient,"We booked to stay one night as a birthday treat for my partner.  There were various personal reasons why we chose the Milestone and our expectations were high.  The service was friendly, though not always efficient.  We had a Junior suite which overlooked the park at the front of the hotel which was a lovely outlook, and whilst not quiet wasn't as noisy as many complain of - this is central London!  Our room wasn't ready on arrival so we did have to wait in the pleasant lounge.  The room was fun, with an interesting theme and well decorated and clean.  The bathroom was out of a different era though (it turns out they have revamped many of the rooms but not the bathrooms - it shows!).  We used the spa and it was good.  I had ordered a romantic turndown (rose petals on the bed,…"
August 2008,Tired,"Firstly, let me say the location is fantastic - if you love being situated on a large open park in the middle of London, an easy cab / tube ride from anywhere interesting.  The service at the hotel is a little oppresive, so for most people it could be regarded as highly favourable.  The building and decor are tired, or quaint, depending on one's perespective.  Our room was tiny, to be polite, stuffed with unnesessary furniture in decor that boarded on kitch.  There was a definite smell of sewage everytime we entered our, overly-compact, room.  You'd attribute this to the 'quaintness', read old-world-ness, of the hotel.  For the price I would have to say pay marginally more and stay at a modern, more up-market, establishment in Park Lane.  Not impressed."
July 2008,Not for Seasoned Travelers,"While most of the reviews of the Milestone have been excellent, I beg to differ.  I found the hotel to be stuffy, old fashioned and appropriate only for first time travelers to the UK.  I much prefer the Baglioni a few doors down (fully booked this timer).  The rooms had too much furniture and tschokes all over the place.  The bar was full of blue haired laddies.  The service stifiling.  The resistance pool was OK and the location is good.  A great place to bring Aunt Edna for her first trip to the UK."
July 2008,beautiful place to stay...,"We loved staying at the Milestone Hotel.. very English and the staff is very helpful.  Our room was small but very elegant and extremely clean.  We had a beautiful view of Hyde Park... which is also the side where the street is, but surprisedly it was quiet. Actually, I specifically noticed things in the hotel, and everything is well taken care of and clean.   My daughter and I had breakfast in our room every morning, the food was good but somewhat expensive.  Pretty much the food in London was expensive.  We ate dinner in the restaurant one evening, it was good and the service was good too.  I would definitely recommend this hotel, good location... great staff and beautiful rooms... we will stay here again."
July 2008,Fantastic but,We have stayed at 5 star hotels all over the world and for service this was one of the best. The staff could not do enough for you. Gavin concierge was excellent.Complimentary tea when we arrived at 11.30 pm and impeccable service throughout our stay. Our only gripe was that our room (311) was facing the road and there was some traffic noise (some sort of intererior glazing would fix) also there was a creaking floorboard in the room above that the guest kept walking over until 1 am that was annoying. All in all if you want a class hotel that lives up to its status then this is it.
June 2008,A gem,"Just an ideal London boutique hotel.  The right size--so that all amenities are available, the right staff--warm and welcoming, and the right location--overlooking Kensington Park.    Our duplex room decorated like a library featured a billards table/dining table (you'd need to see it) and upstairs living area that served as our children's sleeping area.  Bathroom was well appointed (though I find those European shower enclosures frustrating).  Everynight candy and canapes were delivered and the turn-down service was excellent.  Comfy beds. The roll-away beds need some looking after as a couple of them were missing slats. Breakfasts were classic british or continental as you choose.  A sweet little bar/conservatory area make a nice nook for a drink or tea.    My only significant…"
June 2008,The best hotel we have ever stayed at,"Originally I booked this as it was the closest to the Royal Albert Hall as we were going to a concert there.  What a find, nothing was too much trouble and all the staff were very helpful.  Terry showed us around the hotel and our room.  The afternoon tea we had was huge and lovely, the cakes and scones we could not finish they sent up to our room for later.  The room itself was excellent decorated in a victorian theme.  After the concert we came back and sat in the lounge and was entertained by a person singing and playing the piano who was excellent.  Overall a wonderful place that makes you feel special.  Much better than the Ritz which we stayed at the week before and not as pricy."
May 2008,The Most Pleasant Expreience!,"My husband and I just returned from a long weekend at The Milestone May 15-19th.  The hotel is completely charming. The staff is very friendly and accomodating, especially Neil at the concierge, who helped us with restaurant reservations and even offered to personally check out the table at our restaurant before we got there to make sure it was appropriate for us!    Speaking of restaurants, you must try Ffiona's just a few blocks away - what a delicious meal!!  We stayed in a superior double room with a clear view of Kensington Palace  The room was very cozy, nicely decorated and comfortable.  The bathroom was spacious and spotless.    The hotel really feels like a home away from home.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone!  I can see why it remains at the top reviewed by…"
April 2008,Best Hotel Experience in Many Years,"My wife and I stayed in the Milestone Hotel for 4 days while visiting London for our daughter's grad school graduation.  We booked a Superior King room and were delighted upon receiving an upgrade upon arrival.  I travel frequently for both business and personal reasons, and I am very demanding when it comes to service and accomodations. The Milestone exceeded my requirements and expectations in all categories. All members of the staff greeted us by name without exception, including upon our exit from the cab upon arrival, and they were quick to offer assistance and suggestions to meet our every need.  They were the most attentive and friendly hotel professionals that we have encountered in our extensive world travels over a period of many years.  Their personal touch was most…"
April 2008,A haven where the staff care,"A supprise weekend right up to the moment the car pulled up outside the front door. The doorman was there welcoming us (not like the Baglioni) and taking the luggage before you could say Jack Flash. Once inside my partner checked in whilst i chatted with one of the very knowledgable butlers. Once he assertained where we had travelled from he knew who we were without the list. A quick and friendly check in and we were then given the grand tour whilst on route to the Jungle Room. We met and were introduced to most of the F@B staff who would look after us over the next two days.  Well what can i say it was like being a long lost friend, all the  staff knew who we were (just a couple up in town from cornwall) and their willingness to look after everyone with passion and flair was…"
March 2008,Mind the Gap!,"It was our frist trip to England and I was there with my wife to celebrate my birthday, But London is cold at this time of the year...who cares, never been there and had to make it special. London is magical, feeling like Peter Pan although I'm older, I felt like a kid entering Disneyland for he first time, never felt tired until the end of the day, after a day of walking, sightseeing, watching shows at west end, shopping, and dining...but to end my day on my goose down king size bed and pillows just made resting a much different level. The Milestone did not idsaapoint at all even thought they were doing construction during the day, the noise above me at one time was just not tolerable..but any old hotel with so muh character will show its age...and will need upkeep. The room…"
February 2008,Unforgettable,"My girlfriend and I were lucky enough to stay at the luxurious Milestone Hotel, Kensington. We were collected from Liverpool street station in a Bentley by Terry our butler and Keith our chaffer and given a guided tour of London on the way to the Milestone. The stay at the hotel was outstanding and we found EVERY member of staff dedicated to enhancing the experience of staying in such luxurious hotel. The first thing we did after checking in was shop, escorted by Jim the head concierge which gave us the feeling we were in safe hands.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone as I’ve never been somewhere so customer orientated but hope to get the chance again soon. The bar and mixologist, Daniel, and his cocktails were an experience in themselves and not to be missed.  The food was…"
February 2008,"Problems solved, great stay!","We stayed at the Milestone hotel in London with our two sons, aged 5 and 8, after a previous fantastic stay we had as a couple about a month ago. We booked two connecting rooms, but were faced with some serious problems upon arrival. The rooms were on the fifth floor, that was recently refurbished, but evidently this process was not quite finished. There were no locks on the outer door, the rooms were really extremely small, the DVD-player was not working. TV-channels were mixed up, the airco was out of order, etc. All staff members were extremely helpfull and kind, but the problems remained. That evening we told the Milestone this was not worth their five star rating and their splending reputation and invited them to come up with a solution the next morning. The solution they…"
September 2006,Like Staying in a Wonderful Private Home,"If you are looking for a wonderful small hotel with a very British feel then the Milestone is for you!  We had a wonderful stay there.  The staff is so friendly and helpful.  After a full day of site seeing it felt like coming home.....if only my home was decorated so lovely!  The rooms are cheerful and comfortable though a little on the small size compared to American standards.  The location is great, right across the street from Kensington Palace, quiet yet not too far from the action.  The tube station is a short walk and the on and off bus lets you off almost at the hotel door.  There are several good places to eat close by.  We had an excellent meal at the Indian restaurant down the block and the Italian restaurant makes the best pizza...even better than the ones we had in…"
August 2006,The Milestone - A well-kept secret,"We wanted to be near a friend's flat in Kensington and she recommended the Milestone Hotel as an excellent choice of hotel.  We're glad we took her advice - it is a real gem!  The decor is unfussy English and the staff couldn't be any nicer.  Our room was a little small but immaculate and we loved the rain shower head in the bath.  We had an excellent dinner our first night and the breakfast buffet was more than adequate with choices of hot dishes available.  We would definitely stay there again.  Travelers from Amelia Island, FL "
August 2006,Wonderful hotel!,"We had a wonderful stay at the Milestone Hotel from Aug 23 - 26, 2006. The management staff would greet us by name and stop and chat with us  during breakfast or while we were relaxing in the lounge with afternoon drinks. The concierge helped us with tourist venue reservations and also with wonderful dinner reservations at neighborhood restaurants and also at the hotel restaurant. He also helped by email prior to our travels. The head butler is a charming man who is extremely proud of the hotel and is a very good hospitality ambassador! He took us on a tour of the hotel which we enjoyed.  Our room was very quiet and off the main street and tastefully decorated in a French toile motif. We had 2 large chairs to read the daily paper that was delivered to us and to relax in also,…"
July 2006,Milestone exceeds our expectations in every way!,"We had a fantastic stay at the Milestone, and would recommend the hotel to anyone. It is a very charming small hotel, well located within a few minute walk to the High Street - Kensington tube station, where you have access to all of London on their wonderfully convenient Subway system. There is also plenty of shopping, and pubs for dining and nightlife within easy walking distance. Rooms are on the smaller side (which can be expected for London), so I recommend reserving one category higher than you would usually be comfortable in. However they are appointed with every possible modern luxury and convenience, you will not be disappointed. They are richly decorated, with wall hangings, comfortable furniture and beds. But the best part of staying at the Milestone is the service.…"
July 2006,So comfortable!,"15th July, 2006  This is the third visit to this hotel in Kensington which we have found to have excellent service, lovely staff and beautiful rooms. Right in front of Kensington Gardens, you have plenty of shops, pubs and restaurants in walking distance but are only 10 mins away from the West End. Every room I have seen (total of 5) are all differently but individually decorated and include all the essentials even down to stationery items in the desk. We have stayed in many hotels in London (including Claridges and Blakes) but this is our favourite. "
June 2006,Charming Hotel with Great Service,"Our family enjoyed this hotel and its wonderful ambience.  Although one of our original rooms was too small and inconsistent with the description,  the front desk worked with us to move us to a larger room for a supplemental charge. Terry, the butler, was especially charming.  Full English breakfasts were very good, and dinner was excellent.  The concierge was extremely accomodating.  We appreciated the free internet access.  Sometimes the doorman has to work hard to hail a taxi so allow plenty of time before the theatre or dinner out. "
June 2006,Wonderful place to stay!,"My husband and I stayed at the Milestone in June while we were en route to Dover for a cruise to the Baltic.  We had stayed at the Milestone a few times before and always loved it.  We booked a de luxe room with king bed.  The night before we left home for London I had a message on my machine to ring the front desk at the Milestone.  I was worried that something had gone wrong with our reservation!  I talked to the Duty Manager who told me that our room's AC was not working (and London is hot this summer!) so he asked if we would mind down grading to a room with efficient AC.  He added that this would be for one night only, and then, as compensation we would be moved to a suite.  Well, what could I say!  In fact the room we were put in for the first night was lovely, if a little…"
June 2006,Love this hotel and can't wait to return!,This is one of the best small hotels we have ever stayed at anywhere.  We stayed with our teenagers in one of the 2 bedroom apartments.  It had a kitchen and a washer and dryer.  It was beautiful!  The staff is outstanding and the concierges could not have been more helpful.  This hotel was a joy to come back to every afternoon after long hot days of sightseeing.  We have so much more to explore in London and we will look forward to staying here again. 
June 2006,We LOVED the Milestone!!!,"I recently stayed at the Milestone Hotel in London, having won an auction for the stay on luxury link.   The trip was a weekend ""girl's weekend"" on the eve of my brother-in-law's wedding; the three hotel guests were me, my mother-in-law and the bride-to-be.  I wanted this to be a special weekend, so I looked for a nice package on luxurylink.(--) that included extra treats like high tea and a full breakfast, as both of which can be very pricey in london.  The package was for 2 people, but I called ahead and was told it would be okay to have a third person, but there would be a 30 pound fee for an extra bed, and I would have to pay for the third breakfast and tea separately.   Upon arrival, however,  they indicated that they had, instead of adding an additional bed, decided to…"
May 2005,Loved the Milestone,"We stayed for five nights to celebrate silver anniversary and birthday. We had booked through the Leading Hotels of the World website way in advance and got a decent rate that included the continental breakfast. The reception and concierge were very helpful and friendly. When they showed us the bus stop they actually went outside the hotel to point me in the right direction. They hung up the phone when I approached to ask a question. The room was very lovely, with a canopy bed, small table with 2 chairs and a desk. It had a good size closet. The bedroom was a few steps up from the entrance and the bathroom was level with the entrance. The bath was old fashioned and lovely.

December 2023,"Milestone redefined top-notch hospitality – A remarkable stay beyond expectations!""","We travelled from Dubai for a December holiday in the UK, with a short stay in London at the end.  Milestone is by far the best hotel we have stayed at, and that comes from a person who has clocked in 1000+ nights in various hotels over the last 10 years.  What stood out for us: 1. Personal touch: From the doorman to the concierge to the bar staff, every single member of staff made an effort to remember our names and called us by name every time   2. Attention to the smallest of details: spectacular housekeeping and turn down service; for example they wrapped our electronics cables with cable ties to make the room tidy, or they lit a candle in the bath tub every night. They did not forget to restock a single item, it was sheer perfection   3. Food: Exquisite food, especially the breakfast. We are on a healthy diet and their selection catered to those who prefer to indulge and those who want to be healthy  4. Catering to requests: we wanted off menu items which they happily provided us to the room  5. Comfort: the mattress and bed linen was high quality, pillows were the kind you can sink into and the bathroom has very high quality soft towels  We will certainly return and would recommend this hotel to anyone who values the small extra touches and high quality service that is certainly a cut above the rest.…"
July 2023,The Milestone is Awesome!,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the lovely Milestone Hotel, July 23rd-26th, 2023. It more than exceeded our expectations! Prior to arriving in London, my husband had been in Liverpool with friends for The Open and I had been in The Lake District with friends. We planned to meet in London for a few days before returning home. My train on July 23rd was cancelled due to flooding on the tracks which led to a very long day of transfers by taxi from one train station to the next. I finally made it to Euston Station on the evening of July 23rd. When I arrived by taxi to The Milestone, I was greeted by the lovely receptionist who told me we had been upgraded to The Hermes Suite - this was music to my ears, especially after the trying day of travel. My husband was waiting for me in our gorgeous suite, along with a lovely bottle of champagne, fruit, and cheese. We immediately ordered room service, which was delicious. After dinner in our room, I indulged with a good long bath in the stunning marble soaking tub!! What started out being a rather stressful day ended with luxury and relaxation - just what I needed! Our remaining days in London and at The Milestone were wonderful. Breakfast each morning was delicious, and the staff were fabulous! Our trip ended with a very early morning transfer to Heathrow provided by the hotel - we were given morning coffee and a box of delicious fresh baked pastries to take in the car! …"
December 2023,The stables ,"The bar was a perfect blend of all your home comforts met with luxury that in itself made you feel special. The staff were warming and accepting no matter if you were a guest of the hotel or just a passer by. Antonia especially was so enlightening when experiencing the calibre of such a prestigious bar, elaborating on the experience one would undergo as well as the culture of the cocktails related to the bar. It lead to a wonderful night and an experience we will not forget. Can agree with the reviews that this is the best old fashioned in London. "
November 2023,Wedding at The Milestone ,The Milestone went above and beyond in making our wedding day special and memorable for all. What a better way to celebrate a milestone in our life than with the fantastic team atThe Milestone Hotel. 
December 2023,Just Top,The hotel was top. The room is very nice and clean and very comfortable.  Also the staff is very helpful and kindly.  The breakfast is perfect.  Also the location of the hotel is central. This is for real to comeback again   
December 2023,The most special place to stay in London!,"The milestone is full of character and beauty. The food is second to none and the festive afternoon tea is the best we’ve had (and we have sampled more than a few). The staff are warm and friendly and everyday there were small touches that made our stay truly personalised, unique and special. We come back every year and will continue to do so, as for us the hotel is a home away from home. Not to mention the central location which makes it easy to travel all over London. The milestone offers luxury in a warm cosy bundle, which is rare to find."
December 2023,Exquisite Milestone Experience!!!,Unbelievably Wonderful!  The Milestone Hotel is beautiful & the People here are so wonderful!  This has been one of the best experiences of My life! The Milestone has treated Me like royalty !  I want to return again and again and again! Thank You dear Milestone!❤️
November 2023,Simply put.,"Having recently had the absolute pleasure of attending our sons wedding at The Milestone i now know a better venue is not to be found  Staff were both friendly and professional, attentive and took time to befriend us, especially little Arthur who we believe will become a concierge ! The food is exemplary and beyond words If you are looking for a place that’s welcoming, warm and special don’t look elsewhere you have already found the best their is Colin and Wendy Moult"
November 2023,Beyond Comparison,"The Milestone Hotel is a beautiful, five star hotel, located in Kensington. The service, dining experiences and all other aspects of hotel hospitality are beyond comparison. The entire staff are superb in all aspects, and they go out of their way to assist guests. After a week at the hotel recently, we felt the staff treated us like friends, and it was difficult to leave! We will certainly return in the future."
October 2023,Amazing Stay and Attentive Staff Like Family,We had an amazing stay here.  The details and attentiveness of the staff were unmatched.  They treated us like family and took wonderful care of us while in London.  The breakfast each morning was terrific and the location perfect.   We will certainly be back!

December 2023,Exquisite Milestone Experience!!!,Unbelievably Wonderful!  The Milestone Hotel is beautiful & the People here are so wonderful!  This has been one of the best experiences of My life! The Milestone has treated Me like royalty !  I want to return again and again and again! Thank You dear Milestone!❤️
November 2023,Simply put.,"Having recently had the absolute pleasure of attending our sons wedding at The Milestone i now know a better venue is not to be found  Staff were both friendly and professional, attentive and took time to befriend us, especially little Arthur who we believe will become a concierge ! The food is exemplary and beyond words If you are looking for a place that’s welcoming, warm and special don’t look elsewhere you have already found the best their is Colin and Wendy Moult"
November 2023,Beyond Comparison,"The Milestone Hotel is a beautiful, five star hotel, located in Kensington. The service, dining experiences and all other aspects of hotel hospitality are beyond comparison. The entire staff are superb in all aspects, and they go out of their way to assist guests. After a week at the hotel recently, we felt the staff treated us like friends, and it was difficult to leave! We will certainly return in the future."
October 2023,Amazing Stay and Attentive Staff Like Family,We had an amazing stay here.  The details and attentiveness of the staff were unmatched.  They treated us like family and took wonderful care of us while in London.  The breakfast each morning was terrific and the location perfect.   We will certainly be back! 
December 2023,"Milestone redefined top-notch hospitality – A remarkable stay beyond expectations!""","We travelled from Dubai for a December holiday in the UK, with a short stay in London at the end.  Milestone is by far the best hotel we have stayed at, and that comes from a person who has clocked in 1000+ nights in various hotels over the last 10 years.  What stood out for us: 1. Personal touch: From the doorman to the concierge to the bar staff, every single member of staff made an effort to remember our names and called us by name every time   2. Attention to the smallest of details: spectacular housekeeping and turn down service; for example they wrapped our electronics cables with cable ties to make the room tidy, or they lit a candle in the bath tub every night. They did not forget to restock a single item, it was sheer perfection   3. Food: Exquisite food, especially the breakfast. We are on a healthy diet and their selection catered to those who prefer to indulge and those who want to be healthy  4. Catering to requests: we wanted off menu items which they happily provided us to the room  5. Comfort: the mattress and bed linen was high quality, pillows were the kind you can sink into and the bathroom has very high quality soft towels  We will certainly return and would recommend this hotel to anyone who values the small extra touches and high quality service that is certainly a cut above the rest.…"
July 2023,The Milestone is Awesome!,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the lovely Milestone Hotel, July 23rd-26th, 2023. It more than exceeded our expectations! Prior to arriving in London, my husband had been in Liverpool with friends for The Open and I had been in The Lake District with friends. We planned to meet in London for a few days before returning home. My train on July 23rd was cancelled due to flooding on the tracks which led to a very long day of transfers by taxi from one train station to the next. I finally made it to Euston Station on the evening of July 23rd. When I arrived by taxi to The Milestone, I was greeted by the lovely receptionist who told me we had been upgraded to The Hermes Suite - this was music to my ears, especially after the trying day of travel. My husband was waiting for me in our gorgeous suite, along with a lovely bottle of champagne, fruit, and cheese. We immediately ordered room service, which was delicious. After dinner in our room, I indulged with a good long bath in the stunning marble soaking tub!! What started out being a rather stressful day ended with luxury and relaxation - just what I needed! Our remaining days in London and at The Milestone were wonderful. Breakfast each morning was delicious, and the staff were fabulous! Our trip ended with a very early morning transfer to Heathrow provided by the hotel - we were given morning coffee and a box of delicious fresh baked pastries to take in the car! …"
December 2023,The stables ,"The bar was a perfect blend of all your home comforts met with luxury that in itself made you feel special.

Antonia especially was so enlightening when experiencing the calibre of such a prestigious bar, elaborating on the experience one would undergo as well as the culture of the cocktails related to the bar.

December 2023,The stables ,"The bar was a perfect blend of all your home comforts met with luxury that in itself made you feel special. The staff were warming and accepting no matter if you were a guest of the hotel or just a passer by. Antonia especially was so enlightening when experiencing the calibre of such a prestigious bar, elaborating on the experience one would undergo as well as the culture of the cocktails related to the bar. It lead to a wonderful night and an experience we will not forget. Can agree with the reviews that this is the best old fashioned in London. "
November 2023,Wedding at The Milestone ,The Milestone went above and beyond in making our wedding day special and memorable for all. What a better way to celebrate a milestone in our life than with the fantastic team atThe Milestone Hotel. 
December 2023,Just Top,The hotel was top. The room is very nice and clean and very comfortable.  Also the staff is very helpful and kindly.  The breakfast is perfect.  Also the location of the hotel is central. This is for real to comeback again   
December 2023,The most special place to stay in London!,"The milestone is full of character and beauty. The food is second to none and the festive afternoon tea is the best we’ve had (and we have sampled more than a few). The staff are warm and friendly and everyday there were small touches that made our stay truly personalised, unique and special. We come back every year and will continue to do so, as for us the hotel is a home away from home. Not to mention the central location which makes it easy to travel all over London. The milestone offers luxury in a warm cosy bundle, which is rare to find."
December 2023,Exquisite Milestone Experience!!!,Unbelievably Wonderful!  The Milestone Hotel is beautiful & the People here are so wonderful!  This has been one of the best experiences of My life! The Milestone has treated Me like royalty !  I want to return again and again and again! Thank You dear Milestone!❤️
November 2023,Simply put.,"Having recently had the absolute pleasure of attending our sons wedding at The Milestone i now know a better venue is not to be found  Staff were both friendly and professional, attentive and took time to befriend us, especially little Arthur who we believe will become a concierge ! The food is exemplary and beyond words If you are looking for a place that’s welcoming, warm and special don’t look elsewhere you have already found the best their is Colin and Wendy Moult"
November 2023,Beyond Comparison,"The Milestone Hotel is a beautiful, five star hotel, located in Kensington. The service, dining experiences and all other aspects of hotel hospitality are beyond comparison. The entire staff are superb in all aspects, and they go out of their way to assist guests. After a week at the hotel recently, we felt the staff treated us like friends, and it was difficult to leave! We will certainly return in the future."
October 2023,Amazing Stay and Attentive Staff Like Family,We had an amazing stay here.  The details and attentiveness of the staff were unmatched.  They treated us like family and took wonderful care of us while in London.  The breakfast each morning was terrific and the location perfect.   We will certainly be back! 
December 2023,Amazing experience,"Carmelita offered fantastic service. She was very attentive, informative, and friendly. The ambiance and food was very high quality and the live music was soothing. Will definitely be returning with my family!"
December 2023,Birthday Afternoon Tea,Our host Carmelita was amazing! She helped guide us through the Atternoon tea options and then gave us amazing recommendations for the tea! She made my Mums birthday such a success!! Definitely going to come back! Thank you to the entire team at TING but especially Carmelita!!
December 2023,Wonderful!,"In all my years this was one of my favourite hotel experiences.   From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special - Wong on the front desk was cheerful and welcoming and even managed to check us in a little early.  It was a special occasion and my husband had upgraded our room.  It had a WOW factor from the second we opened the door.   The view was incredible and the fact I could lie in bed and look at St. Pauls Cathedral was a real added bonus.  Our dinner and breakfast were of the highest quality.  Breakfast is a mixture of service and self service.  There is much choice but do not hesitate to ask if there is anything you would like brought to your table.  Rarely do I leave a hotel without any negative comments, however small.  My only disappointment was that we were…"
December 2023,Amazing experience,Rahul the attendant has been amazing! I brought my wife for her birthday celebration and she loved the experience! We will never forget the soft spoken and very attentive experience provided by Rahul.
December 2023,Rahul’s great service at Ting,"Rahul at Ting - the Shard was fantastic and attentive during dinner, he made our anniversary special with the dessert message! Appreciate the fast service also. Very nice and friendly. We liked the 5 spice beef. "
December 2023,Amazing restaurant experience!!,"We had a fantastic family meal here. The food was incredible, attention to detail and taste was out of this world. The service was impeccable and many thanks, especially to Yassin especially for giving us a personalised and memorable experience looking after us. He is an asset to the Restaurant team for sure.  Alex, the manager also personally made sure my two young daughters were made to feel special and he was incredibly knowledgeable about the history of the restaurant and and hotel business - such a gentleman  too.  We would highly recommend a  visit and look forward to visiting again."
October 2023,GREAT TIME!,"I have to say this is the best hotel that I have stayed at London so far.  From the amazing welcoming staff to the checkout time, I have enjoyed every minute in this hotel. I will be coming back to this hotel when I am traveling back to London."

December 2023,Sky Lounge staffing and visit  ,Lovely evening in the Sky Lounge.  Adore greeted us and provided other services during the evening. He seemed to be covering a number of positions and provided an incredible service.  Definitely should be recognised by senior staff. 
December 2023,Unforgettable experience,"A wonderful stay to celebrate a special wedding anniversary. Every member of your team ensured we had a memorable stay, from the two wonderful ladies in guest relations, who helped me plan the weekend with romantic touches, to the outstanding lady in charge of reception and the friendly reception team. The room and bed were so comfortable, not to mention the incredible views. Unforgettable   "

The food here was amazing. It was a lot for one person. The views would make you cry with how beautiful they are. "
November 2023,An afternoon tea in the clouds!,"We had a great time at the Festive Afternoon Tea at TĪNG Shangri-la this November.   Dining in the clouds on the 35th floor, or taking in the expansive view of London’s iconic skyline (when the weather permits) is an experience we will not forget in a hurry.  The quality and freshness of seasonal ingredients and flavours made the food items really stand out.   The task of selecting from their extensive menu of signature teas was quite the adventure, but one we enjoyed thoroughly. The Green Gunpowder tea was a favourite.   The genuine care and hospitality of the TĪNG Restaurant staff made our afternoon tea a relaxing and enjoyable experience. Special shout out to Jing who looked after us.  It's the most wonderful time of the year, as the famous Christmas song goes. This afternoon…"
November 2023,Amazing service,"We do not normally go to places like this , it was my birthday and my husband took us for dinner .  The service provided by MARRI was amazing .made us feel so comfortable. RAHUL did an amazing job as well .  The food was amazing and so was the view . Overall a great experience."
November 2023,Rahul nailed it,"Rahul nailed it. Like really nailed it. He was kind, attentive, and made sure our visit was all class. He also made sure to get us a seat near the window so that we could have picturesque views of the city. Would definitely visit again."
November 2023,Top Notch!,"Alex and Mathias were our waiters and they couldn’t be more obliging! They took our photos making every effort to get the perfect shot! They sang me happy birthday and brought out all the works to make it special for us! The food, the views and the service is top tier and I would highly recommend for any occasion!!"
November 2023,Excellent service ,"The ambiance is superb, We highly recommend it , the food was amazing and the service was fantastic.

November 2023,Another fabulous stay!,"I booked this beautiful hotel for my daughter’s birthday and we had a great time. Having come here to celebrate my husband’s 40th back in the summer, I was very keen to come back.  The attention to detail was fabulous- cakes delivered to the room, a personalised card a brilliant room upgrade. Thank you to Maria for sorting! My daughter loved our stay and wants to visit again. Thank you to all at the Shanghai-La for a fabulous weekend."
November 2023,"Exceptional at every turn, highly recommended and simply a stunning place for any occasion. The perfect location!","Absolutely stunning experience from start to finish. The views are outstanding, the food and drink is wonderful and the entire staff were brilliant. Highly recommended for couples, families and that special trip. Great location, too - amazing!"
November 2023,Wonderful breakfast experience ,Service and quality of produce are impeccable. Wonderful breakfast.  Fresh vegetables like no other. Facility is very spacious and the view is breathtaking. Greatest Oolong tea we had in England.  Thank you 
October 2023,"A must do experience, stunning views","A must do experience. I have been up the shard twice now. It’s definitely worth the visit, stunning views over London. We visited the hotel restaurant, the drinks are very expensive so be warned! But it’s more about the priviledge of the views you get over London. Would recommend."
October 2023,Dated and tired,"The rooms are incredibly tired and dated.... it needs a total overhaul to call it a 5 star... at the moment I'd rather stay in a holiday Inn.  Rooms don't give that ""lux hotel room"" feel... more like an office... Ware on parts of the room need changing untill they are totally re-fitted... a real shame"
October 2023,"Super afternoon with family - thank you,  Yassin","Had a brilliant afternoon here today with my wife and 2 children aged 8&12. The service from Yassin was flawless.  We struggled to get pictures of ourselves with the beautiful backdrop,  but Yassin helped us by going above and beyond and recommending the best spot and also taking our picture.  Will definitely be back,  thank you!!"
October 2023,That View. That Service. But…,"For the price, it fell short in so many ways. The doors are scratched (I mean shredded) the bath rug was frayed, the bed skirt was torn, the mattress pad was not attached on three of the corners, the window had writing on it from a previous guest, the window coverings could not be operated individually (that we could find) so instead of our neighbor having a clear view into our room and them into ours, we had to close that entire wall of window shades instead of just the one that would have shielded us. There was tape on the walls left over from maybe a decoration? The metal finishing on doors/walls was severely scratched, the binoculars had a nice cheat sheet to show you what you were looking at, but that little booklet was old and frayed and dog-eared and overused. There were…"
October 2023,don’t ever miss this place if you come to London!,"Great view and the food was superB 🫶🏻🫶🏻 love everything in here! We ordered 3 main courses menu, and I highly recommend the beef tartar, dingley dell pork and berries vacherin! The service was nice, staff is super friendly, he’s name is Yassin."
October 2023,Afternoon tea at Ting ,We had a pleasant afternoon tea at Ting with an amazing view over the city London. The little pastries and sandwiches tasted good. Jing an Ana were very helpfull and kind.  Thank u for you're hospitality. 
October 2023,"Perfection in Sky. We had the pleasure of staying here for 2 nights, which we will remember forever. Thank you","We had the pleasure of staying here for 2 nights, from the minute you arrive through to departure absolutely everything is taken care of by an outstanding team. Nothing is too much trouble, the food in all the restaurants is very special, a special thanks to Jamila in Gong, and outstanding lady, and of course Tyrone who could not have been more helpful. This is in my opinion is the standard all 5 Star hotels in London should strive to achieve. Can’t wait to return. Thank you all."
October 2023,First class service at a first class location with brilliant staff,"A friend and I went for a celebratory birthday drink at the Sky Lounge on Saturday 28th October. It was an unforgettable experience and we were treated like royalty. José, Simona and Giorgio were incredible hosts and really made the occasion so special and a birthday I will never forget. Thank you."
October 2023,Ting Shangrila,"Had a great experience! Miss Jenn, she is a Filipinas  is the one who assisted us with everything, she explained the menu and she even prepared some cake for my birthday! ;) It's really a good experience! Surely will come back again! Thank you for the good food!"
November 2023,Afternoon tea,"Afternoon tea was acceptional, food and drink topped up as and when needed. Service by Jing was amazing. Would highly recommend a fantastic afternoon. Attention to every detail was second to none, even allowed us to bring the leftovers home Exceptional"
November 2023,Birthday at Ting,"We went to celebrate my birthday at the Shangri-La’s Ting in London and it was an absolute amazing experience!  The view from the 35th floor at night was breathtaking!  We indulged and had the 5-course tasting menu and each dish was beautifully presented as was delicious.  The dessert with the dry ice captured the final moments of the evening.  But I must recognize Rahul for his outstanding service and kindness displayed throughout the meal.  This is a birthday I will truly remember!  Warmly, Nathan L"
November 2023,"Disappointing Experience with Privacy Concerns at Shangri-La The Shard, London","My partner and I recently stayed at Shangri-La The Shard, London, a hotel we chose for its reputation and the special occasion we were celebrating – a marriage proposal. Unfortunately, our experience was far from what we expected, deeply affecting what should have been a joyous and memorable event.  The most significant issue we faced was a severe lack of privacy. Our room, which was one of the higher-tier rooms with a view of London, had clear visibility issues into and from adjacent rooms. This design flaw led to uncomfortable situations where we could see other guests in their private moments, and they could see us. The experience was distressing, especially during such a personal occasion.  Upon raising our concerns with the hotel staff, we were offered a room change, which…"
November 2023,First time afternoon tea,Wonderful views and ambiance. Helga was our server and she was fantastic. It was my children’s first time at afternoon tea and she explained everything and offered different options to try. It was a highlight of our trip to London. 
November 2023,Amazong ,"The service was awesome  Rahul and Emil from Ting Restuarant was amazing, very patient and attentive. I would consider going back again and again. The food was very tasty and many options to choose from. Mouth-watering dishes and excellent good service. "
November 2023,Very disappointing stay,"We were treated to a stay at the Shangri-La, The Shard for our wedding anniversary, by our daughter. Upon check in we were advised we had been upgraded, but at no time was it made clear to us that a substantial additional fee had been charged and taken from our account. It wasn’t until we queried this with the manager the next day this was clarified, we had to wait for two days for this to be refunded! Totally unacceptable. We were originally booked into a Superior Shard King room, having researched before our visit, the rooms appeared a good size with a table and chairs to enjoy the views (this is why people stay here?!?) However, the upgrade room was very small, and the view obstructed by a huge desk covering over half of the width of the window, next to this was a very small…"
November 2023,Expected better,"Not a ShangriLa experience. Had to change rooms in room breakfast came late and the order was wrong. There is a bit of smell in the bathroom.  Staff was nice at the front desk. The doors of the rooms are all scratched up.  They need to improve, a lot."
November 2023,Best date ever ,Rahul and Zoran were wonderful this evening brilliant customer service skills supper delightful will definitely come back  Great views lovely wine and brilliant atmosphere to have a great and beautiful time 
November 2023,Amazing,What an amazing place to stay: views to die for; impeccable service; amazing food (Ting restaurant); awesome memories made and service beyond any other. Would highly recommend to anyone to experience the Shard!
November 2023,Festive Afternoon at Ting,"Afternoon tea at Ting was amazing, we went for my daughter’s Birthday. We were served by Jing who was very attentive.  Fantastic views, and fabulous food. Great choice of teas.    Highly recommended. "
October 2023,Everything is great,We visited with my wife for our anniversary.  everything was perfect.I would like to thank Yassin and Berk for taking care of us.The food and view are wonderful. The staff is very attentive.  I will definitely visit again.  I recommend it to my friends too
October 2023,Amazing experience ,"Great customer service, amazing food & great atmosphere. Felt welcomed upon arrival, everything explained and all the offers communicated. Felt a personal touch was added to our night.  Jenny Renate served us and was amazing."
October 2023,Divine dining experience! ,"Dreamy Pink afternoon tea was absolute bliss! Everything was exquisite! The surroundings, the view, the food, the service! I cannot fault anything. It felt so decadent, a truly wonderful experience with delicacies that just melted in the mouth. Jenny was impeccable and attentive along with the rest of the team that made this experience truly one to remember, and the Shard shaped chocolate with it's dramatic serve over dry ice was so much fun! Absolutely worth every penny! "
October 2023,Cloud 9,"We had the most wonderful stay at Shangri-La after our wedding. We arrived just in time to enjoy the sunsetting. Right from the start the team went out of their way to make our stay a joy, keeping check in short so we could watch London come alive with evening lights.   As you enter, the blinds rise and you are met with the most incredible view of the river and the City. The team are so sweet that they chalk a welcome greeting onto the window to help to make the stay even more memorable   We were spoiled with roses, champagne, chocolates and macaron. Everyone who helped us could not have been more charming, friendly or warm.   We enjoyed all the fantastic facilities that the hotel boasts, especially the swimming pool.   Thank you so much for an unforgettable experience. We loved…"
June 2023,Amaze ,"Amaze  Loved the food and the view and the champagne was pretty amaze too! Service was second to none, and the food was fabulous x.   Would highly recommend for a treat but a little on the expensive side for everyday m, or unless you’re totally loaded 🤣"
October 2023,Amazing brunch with the SkyLounge team,"Wow! It’s our 2nd time & we celebrated our daughter’s bday with a nice brunch. The entire team went above & beyond from Simona, Noni, Viola, Jojo, Asoree to Tatiana. They were all outstanding. The menu & drinks offered a wide variety. Overall a great experience, food, ambiance & service was superb. I’m a big advocate for breast awareness and glad to see the place decorated with pink ribbons to show support. Hope to visit again!"
October 2023,Terrific high tea at Ting!,"Terrific time at Ting!  High tea with scrumptious sandwiches, creative and delicious sweets and the marvelous Shard concoction! Bubbly and cocktails, fabulous views from all sides, beautiful setting-  exceptional service and attentiveness from Alex Pardis! Had a fabulous time!"
October 2023,Five Star plus experience !,"My wife and I celebrated our 40 th wedding anniversary here . Without a doubt this is the best Shangri  La I have stayed in . Over the years we have been to the Sydney.  Tokyo , Colombo , Hong Kong , Hambantota and Istanbul hotels and this is the best . The facilities are excellent , rooms very comfortable but the approach taken by the staff is the main differentiator . Their approach is that everything is feasible and they will do anything they can to make your stay memorable  . In particular Yannick the reception manager was incredible . Thank you ."
October 2023,Superb!,"My husband surprised me with celebrating our first anniversary in the Shard!  This was a lovely surprise as I never expected it! The stay was amazing and convenient as it is literary on top of London Bridge station. From the moment you enter with a welcoming drink to settling in the room… everything was absolutely amazing!  My husband and I also loved their A La carte breakfast menu and we truly enjoyed our breakfast with a superb view in the morning (we were lucky the weather was gorgeous to allow us appreciate the view).  The only tiny issue I had at our stay, is when we were out almost for over 6 hours during the day and when we got back the room wasn’t made… We called room service who efficiently sent someone to make the room and it was sorted within forty minutes.  All in…"
October 2023,Luxury location - luxury prices,"A luxurious way to spend a weekend in London, if you try to avoid looking at the price! We came here for our first anniversary and were up-sold to a corner room with an amazing view of the city. While I was hoping that they were looking to upgrade us due to the celebration (they instead charged me an extra £100 per night!) I will admit that the room was brilliant. Spacious, modern, but mainly the sweeping panoramic views to die for.  Breakfast was again expensive but high quality. You’ll be looking at £42 per person for the buffet, with an a la carte option with your typical selection of breakfast offerings. We didn’t eat for dinner while we stayed.  The location is excellent as it is situated directly above London Bridge station - you’ll be able to see most central London…"
October 2023,Afternoon Tea @Ting,"I had afternoon tea @ TING and it was a 10/10 experience for me.  First, the view- duh! The food was good and the service was great! Jenny helped me and she was a delight. Very helpful w/my tea choices and just an overall lovely lady who assisted me. It’s totally worth the price tag, especially if you’re celebrating something special. "
October 2023,Amazing pink afternoon tea!,"The most amazing pink afternoon tea experience for breast cancer awareness month! Dinil looked after us and was the best! Clearly described all the food to us, his tea recommendations were all spot on as well and he was great company and so attentive. We loved the view, were treated to almost every season the UK has to offer in one afternoon and even better that the pink afternoon tea benefits charity! Thank you Renate and all your team x"
October 2023,Great location accompanied by great service. ,We had some lovely drinks this evening served by Mathias. We didn’t have a reservation but the team found us a cosy spot anyway. Mathias was thoughtful and attentive for us. The drinks were really enjoyable and we would happily come back again.
September 2023,Consistently good,"Another fantastic few days at the Shangri La. This time, we stayed for 6 days and enjoyed - just like on past stays - great service, omnipresent views, and slept in a meticulously tidy and serviced room.   Special thanks to the sky pool staff and jenny and carlos at breakfast!"
September 2023,Highly recommended for special occasions ,"A truly memorable experience and highly recommended for special occasions. We were looked after very well by Yassin, who only started at the Ting Restaurant a few weeks ago. The food and service were excellent. The views of London from our table were magical."
September 2023,A fantastic experience,What an experience! Went for champagne afternoon tea for a birthday. The quality was amazing but the service fro Helga was second to none. Attentive knowledgeable and provided excellent recommendations. Can't wait to return 
September 2023,Great food with a skyline view ,It was a great experience our server jenny and Emilio was great food tasted amazing with view. Definitely I recommend to visit here.  If you wanna have a great view of London skyline   5 star food  5 star service  5 star ambience  
September 2023,Enjoy the Gong at the Shard!,"The Gong at the Shard was top notch! Make sure to ask for Medalina as she was our server and was absolutely amazing. She had great recommendations and was such a pleasure to my family and I. The food, cocktails and views were also amazing! The Gong is a must go!"
September 2023,Great stay with an amazing view,"Spent a night at the Shanghai-la Shard in Premier City View room for our anniversary. The hotel is impressive but lacks the grandeur of its 5 star London peers. Unsurprisingly its USP is the view, for which you pay handsomely. The service was great throughout and that really is a plus point across every staff member we encountered.   We ate lunch, dinner and breakfast in Ting (in that order). The five course tasting menu for dinner was good but nothing special. Three out of the five courses were pre-prepared and felt a bit mass produced but the fish and beef courses were excellent. Overall as the main restaurant I thought the hotel could do a lot more to make Ting more atmospheric at night, it’s too bright and lacking atmosphere, all a bit generic and felt like a classic hotel…"
September 2023,"Afternoon team at Ting, The Shard London ","Great experience today enjoying afternoon team at Ting, The Shard in London. Amazing views, beautiful live music and special thanks to Dave and the team who made it special for us. We definitely recommend coming by to enjoy the atmosphere from 35 floors up. "

September 2023,A View To Kill,"Gông Bar   Hostesses/Waitress Madalina and Elena  Experience:  It was my sister's birthday and the experience was amazing. Both ladies were knowledgeable and made us feel comfortable by having chats with us from time to time.   They made the whole experience feel more personal, instead of making it a very static one.  On top of that, the view was spectacular! "
August 2023,Special Birthday treat from friends,"My partner and I were given a gift voucher for a special birthday and this experience could not have been more special. The service, food and atmosphere of the restaurant were 5 star. Our waiters, Syed and Andre, provided a first class service and looked after us all evening. And the view was fabulous! We will definitely go again. "
September 2023,Anniversary Dinner from the top with an unique & charms service,"We had the amazing experience to have dinner at the Shangri-La restaurant. Food was amazing .

September 2023,Shard London experience ,Jenny the waitress at Ting restaurant was really pleasing. Great service. The food taste really hot and if needed extra hot drinks please ask them. Very comfortable seating and arrangement. The chocolate marble cake is a must try. 
August 2023,Gong bar honeymoon ,"Not only is the scenery beautiful and the food delicious, but what's even better is having two excellent bartenders, KYRIAKOS and DAVIDE. Their specialty cocktails are exceptional; the sour version features the floral notes of grapefruit, while the sweet version uniquely incorporates almond flavor, with just the right level of sweetness, and a creamy texture."
September 2023,Our Server Mathias at the Ting the Shard,"Our experience with Mathias at the Ting was fabulous. Our dinner was explained well by Mathias and he gave us a sense of welcome and ease of comfort while dinning at the restaurant. Food was great, we celebrated our anniversary at the Ting, Shangrila the Shard"

(Mathias) was exceptional and thought of everything. He made sure we had anything we needed and was very understanding when my flight was delayed. The live music was lovely too."
September 2023,Amazing attention to detail,Mathios was great. Amazing attention to detail. On hands service. Very helpful with dietary requirements. Personable and great representative of Shangri-la. He took great pride in his service which shone through.
August 2023,Thank you 😊,Yassin was so lovely! Thank you for looking after us. Very attentive & polite. Really appreciated the complimentary deserts.. You made our experience even more memorable - Someone give this man a pay rise!! Thank you 😊 
August 2023,"It actually worths 4 stars, the one star taken away is its price","Located in one of the most iconic sites in London, the Shard, The Shangri-la The Shard, London has always been one of the hotels on my bucket list if I ever have a chance to travel to the city.  Now that I have emigrated to the UK and before I have secured a place to rent, I would definitely jump at this opportunity, but does it live up to its hype as one of the most iconic hotels in London, and more important, has it got the wow factor to justify its lofty price even for London five star hotel’s standard?  Well, sadly, if you are expecting something as bling bling style as the iconic structure of the Shard, you would probably be disappointed, as once you have pass through the very James Bond like security bag search, the place would not be mistaken as another Shangri-la…"
August 2023,"Great food , service and tea",Amazing service and food. Alot to eat so make sure to come hungry. Dave was a great server and had some great recommendations and handled feedback very well. Many desserts all different flavors and a mix of savory and sweet to satisfy different tastes.
August 2023,Dave for the win,It was our first time here and everything was so tasty! The service was impeccable. Dave did a fantastic job as our waiter. His tea suggestions were the best of what we had (get the Mango tea & white apricot!). I highly recommend!
August 2023,Solo tea time,I did the tea time at Ting. Obviously people come for the view but the food and service are perfect as well. My server (Dave) was incredible. He handled his tables well and knew how to provide everyone with a great experience. The spread for a tea time was great. I would recommend!
August 2023,Dinner at the Ting,It was a rainy and lightning day but...Very good service from Dinil an Rahul at the Ting. . We ate dinner at the Ting. Highly recommend. Great atmosphere an live singing. Food was nice an great hazelnut latte. 
August 2023,Outstanding experience with nice food,It was an surreal experience. I got lucky and sat right at the Windows. The View was absolutely amazing. The food was very good. I had the salmon as a Starter and It was absolutely perfect. Mathias was my waiter and he was really really nice! Thank you! The food and Drinks are a bit pricy but for me It was absolutely worth It.
August 2023,Possibly the Best Hotel Service in London,"The service of Shangri-La The Shard is second to none in London.  Right from the porters, concierge, guest relations officers to front desk, every staff serves you from the heart.  And it’s no lip service.  They all do their works efficiently and in a most helpful manner.   To be frank, they help me find my lost wallet with passport in it.  We would not forget how conscientious, proactive and thoughtful they were in taking care of every aspect during the situation.  Among them, we wish to particularly thank from our hearts Bassam, Iewa, Leah and Mariana, who have done everything for us - checking the driveway and entrance and the Uber driver, providing us with all useful info and speaking all the calm words before we found the wallet.  They took the matter in their hearts and…"
August 2023,Amazing,"Amazing views, atmosphere, food and service. We had the 5 course tasting menu and it was fantastic! Would definitely recommend for a special treat. Thought it was good value for money and the staff were wonderful "
August 2023,Hotel stay review,"Wonderful view as all have mentioned but the hotel needs some repairs.  The faux leather doors to the hotel rooms are so worn, it looks terrible.  The water pressure in the bathroom is low so it’s takes forever to fill the tub.  The pool area is tiny and jammed with people.  The workout area is small as well.  The room sizes are wonderful though. Overall it was a wonderful stay but the hotel and clientele feel very Michael Kors vs. Dior!"
August 2023,Afternoon Tea at Ting,I had afternoon tea at Ting and Dave was phenomenal! He was attentive and went above and beyond to give the full experience. The food was delicious (and there was more than expected!) Plus the views were incredible! 
August 2023,A wonderful evening with excellent table service.,"A wonderful evening with incredible views of glorious London! The food at Ting was delicious, and the service was impeccable; Mathias, our waiter, went over and beyond to make sure our evening was a success. He was attentive, smart, professional, knowledgeable about the menu, and had a charming demeanour about him. An excellent example of high-class service. Gracias/Merci/Thank you, Mathias! "
August 2023,Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon tea @Ting was amazing.  Dave was wonderful.  We had the vegan options which were fantastic! The views, the service and the ambiance made the experience memorable.  Will definitely visit again when I’m back in London.  "
August 2023,Amazing food,"Syed/Rahul really looked after us, with great food recommendations. He suggested the 5 spice beef and fried rice … we also had the prawns. Food was amazing. Service was fast and couldn’t do enough for us."
July 2023,Henry’s amazing birthday bash,"We spent an amazing night at the Shard for my nephew’s birthday. Kurt and his staff were amazing, they gave us a warm welcome and looked after us all night. The drinks and food were delicious and we were surrounded by breathtaking scenery. The staff ensured my nephew had a birthday to remember, thank you again for some wonderful memories. "
July 2023,Faultless,"Incredible experience. Attention to detail is second to none. Staff are super helpful and attentive. Rooms are wonderful and comfortable. Views of London are mind blowing, especially in the evening. Cannot wait to return!"
August 2023,Spectacular,"We are devotees of The Savoy but my husband was very keen to try Shangri-La for his 40th birthday. It does not disappoint. Staff went out of their way to make the occasion special and there were some lovely little gestures left. It is a spectacular place with breathtaking views. The infinity pool is especially worth a visit. The only thing I would ask is that they get their billing right- as a a Circle Member, I did not want to have to highlight what we had included upon checkout. They did very promptly sort it though. Fab. Throughly recommended."
August 2023,A special and luxurious treat,"We visited Ting at The Shard for dinner and arrived right at 5:30 when it opened. We were given a window table and while the the views were spectacular (the main event, really), the service was equally superb.  Dave was our server and he was responsive, helpful and kind. He seemed to anticipate all of our needs and was always at the table right away.  He even managed to make a “grown up dinner” accessible to our 8 year old by highlighting the Top your Own Sundae option, with fruit and chocolate, which, of course, we had to get.  In short, while this was certainly a splurge, it seemed a worthwhile and luxurious way to spend a celebratory evening in London. I would highly recommend to those seeking a special treat."
July 2023,An iconic evening at an iconic hotel,"I struggle to explain with words how simply amazing this hotel and the facilities are, each time I visit it feels like the first again, discovering new views and exploring what the hotel has to offer. Having previously stayed at this hotel and multiple Shangri-La hotels and being blown away by the service, attention to detail and luxury of the hotels, I couldn’t wait to return - this time I returned for a friends birthday celebrations. On returning I instantly felt at home, with the addition of the super friendly, helpful staff being on hand. With the pool being the party location, the views were, as always, unmatched, the drinks were extraordinary and the atmosphere was unrivalled, all expertly created by the wonderful staff at the hotel. Another fantastic night hosted by the…"
July 2023,Beautiful food,Our waiter Dave was fantastic and attentive he waited while we took photos before he served the first course. Only note was that wine ordered at the beginning came out later than expected from another server. 
July 2023,4 night stay in an iconic London landmark!!,"Room is large, has a great view of London and bathroom is stunning. The hotel itself and the public areas however, did not feel as luxurious as expected. The entrance at street level feels like an airport hotel with queues for lifts  which always seemed packed. The lobby had a similar feel and does not feel particularly welcoming or exclusive.  Staff do not seem that friendly apart from the porters. You are paying to stay in a landmark, which is a lovely experience, but it means crowds in the bars etc so you loose the feeling of coming back to a warm hospitable retreat at the end of the day. We feel there are better hotels in London in this price range. It takes more than the building to create that feeling of exclusive 5 star hospitality."
July 2023,Wife’s Birthday at TING,"We came her for my wife’s birthday and Dave provided an excellent service. From the moment we sat down to even service of the meal, he went above and beyond to enjoy we were comfortable and had an amazing time. He was also understanding in going out of his way to ensure we had a great window view, we made all the birthday extra experience. Thanks Dave and highly recommend the venue "
July 2023,Yassin was great,Yassin was really friendly and was able to serve us with no issues even though we had a crying baby. Thank you yassin for being patient and very understanding. You did really well for your first day .
July 2023,My first trip to London at the best Hotel possible,"The best staff in London! Everything was perfect! I’ve never seen so many nice people working together in a long time! Thanks for everything! God bless you all for your kindness! In special for the receptionists, concierges, doormans and waiters! See you next time!"
July 2023,10/10,"One of the best dinner experiences of my life. The view is worth the price alone but the good and drinks make this experience 100% worth it. If you are in London for more than a few days and are able to, this is definitely something you should try."
July 2023,Wonderful and memorable.,From the moment we arrived the staff were friendly and attentive. The host at the door saw us to our seats. The gentle live music in the background added to the ambiance. We were served by Dave big thank you to him for making my 70th Birthday special ! 
July 2023,Ting Afternoon Tra,"Amazing view and excellent service! Ate Jenny made the experience extra special! ❤️🇵🇭  To be very honest, the security officer made us feel uncomfortable in the beginning, he was cold, and unwelcoming.  Well, thanks to the lovely service of Ting Restaurant for making us feel welcome! "
July 2023,Wonderful time in London,"Amazing food, accommodations and service from all the staff, Specially Marius.  Highly recommended! The food was delicious and the staff was super friendly and professional. Will definitely come back to The Shard at any location around the world!"
July 2021,"A very nice stay indeed, if only the staff was a little friendlier! ","Stayed at the Shangri-La for 2 nights in June.   A very enjoyable experience staying at the SL. The building is outstanding, the room was well appointed and with a beautiful view.   The staff we encountered was a little stand-offish but quite efficient.   One of the evenings we had dinner at Ting; the food was lovely and so was the wine we picked and the service was just top notch.   We also had a drink at the Sky Lounge which had amazing views and the staff there was less stand-offish and more friendly.   A lovely experience indeed, so won't hesitate to stay there again. "
July 2023,Excellent Service from Zoran,"Me and my friends decided to have late dinner at Ting Restaurant at The Shard. Apart from the nice view, Zoran, who served us, was very nice and he was so good. He completed the whole experience. He was very efficient and attentive and made sure we we’re looked after. It’s really worth the visit."
July 2023,Ask for Zoran to serve you he is the best !,"Zoran was amazing and catered to our every needs. Honestly A+5 service!! He recommended dishes that were absolutely yummy!! The place - Ting restaurant - was superb from the design of the place, to the mouth-watering food, the unbeatable view of London and the top-notch customer service. All in all was the best experience!"
June 2023,Unforgettable Experience at The Shard Top Bar thanks to Sarah,"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  I recently had the opportunity to visit the Top Bar at The Shard, and it was nothing short of extraordinary. To start with, the place was bustling with energy and yet, we were welcomed warmly by a lady named Sarah at the entrance. Despite the bar being exceptionally busy and us not having a reservation, Sarah went out of her way to find us a spot. Her professionalism, attentiveness, and willingness to accommodate truly set the tone for our evening.  The panoramic view from the Top Bar was breathtaking - a sight that you can't find anywhere else. It was like having London's iconic skyline on a canvas, and we were lucky enough to be a part of that picture. It’s the kind of view that leaves you staring in awe and creates memories that last a lifetime.  As for the service, it…"

July 2023,"Delicious food, great service, great views.",Had anniversary dinner at Ting. Provided us with window table even though very busy. Our server Dave was very friendly and helpful. He even stopped us from ordering too much food. Food was delicious. Will have to come back to try the beef short ribs next time! Most dishes are halal which was an added bonus.
July 2023,An Enchanting Culinary Journey at Ting: London’s  Finest Dining Experience," Ting, London's finest restaurant, offers an unparalleled dining experience. Here, you'll encounter Dave's top-notch service, an elegant five-course menu full of tasteful, juicy dishes paired with the most exotic sauces, and the most stunning views of the city.

May 2023,Special Treat and few days in London,"Fantastic hotel, real treat to stay here. Amazing views of the river and across London.   We had two adjoining rooms with kids in one room and even they enjoyed the views!!  As one would expect fantastic service as always from Shangri-La!   Top floor restaurant was a little underwhelming, perhaps as view from room was better.   Pool beautiful but could only take a handful of people and had to book for kids to attend."
July 2023,Syed can make it special!!,"Syed was pure joy to serve and advise! Perfect service quietly, quickly, just right. How can anyone rate this place less than perfect!  Delightful presentation, prawns and beef, special treats. Views!"
July 2023,Lovely Hotel and people but fundamental issue needs looking into,"Let me first off start by saying that The hotel attentiveness and attention to detail is unrivalled. I booked a celebration in the cloud experience which was truly delightful. The timing for the delivery of the champagne was brilliant, The message on the window and decorations all had my girlfriend very happy. Now, the stay was lovely. We had a deluxe city view which was great. (I'd say always opt for a city view) if possible. I've also stayed In a Premier city view room before. The difference being, the Premier room has and extra side window for additional lighting / views and a bit more space overall. The food at ting for the 5 course taster meal really nice. The breakfast buffet was absolutely brilliant. The spa and pool was also nice - just ensure you make a booking during…"

June 2023,Love it! Thank You Freddy for Serving Us!,"It’s a must-have experience if you want to have afternoon tea in London. The elevator will take you up to the 35th floor and the view is astonishing once you walk in. I took my daughter there, and that was her first experience in London and with afternoon tea, and she loved it! Our server, Freddy, was very patient and friendly. He made sure we understood the menu, and took fully care of us so we enjoyed the tea time with no worries at all! Love it! "
July 2023,Sky High,"The views from the room were magnificent.  The rooms were spacious and clean, with very comfortable beds.  I thought check-in was a bit weak in that it took a while to be ready, and once it was finally ready, our bags weren't in them.  The room keys malfunctioned numerous times over the course of three days (I would estimate that we went through a total of 18 different room keys.)  It was an expensive stay, but the bellinis in reception were a nice touch.  "
July 2023,Amazing hosts and view,Dani and Tommy were the best hosts we could ever ask for. We were celebrating our wedding and they made it an even better night than we expected! Their cocktail skills were incredible - we just gave them ingredients we liked and they made up the perfect match!
September 2022,Extravagant & Extraordinary,"I had the (free) privilege of staying at the Shangri-La for 2 nights back in September 2022 - all thanks to a dear family member of mine.  I stayed in (if I remember correctly) one of the Superior King rooms. Lovely room with fantastic blue carpets, massive bed with the TV directly opposite, behind it was the lovely view of London. The view spread around the whole room due to it being almost all glass! Brilliant!  There is an indoor pool which unfortunately I didn't get to try out - no fault of the hotel, I just didn't have the time. I imagine it's fantastic. The gym also looked well equipped.   Breakfast also didn't disappoint! I enjoyed the Wye Smoked Salmon with a lovely black coffee.  Honestly, everything was perfect. It's a shame I didn't have a lot of time to get the full…"

Great views of London but really overpriced.","Have wanted to stay in this hotel for ages saved it for my wife’s 40th birthday and we made a night of it booking dinner at the romantic table in the restaurant which came out an extra cost but was worth it for the views. Have to say the food wasn’t great, and we expected more, especially for the price Hotel rooms great views all over London which were spectacular, the spa is also nice on the 52nd floor but you have to book and they ask you to get changed in your room and walk past a busy restaurant in a robe which wasn’t good but overall nice but the cost really wasn’t worth it for the overall stay  We stayed in many hotels around the world, this one’s lovely, but just really overpriced We spent over £1300 for 1 night with dinner and a bottle of wine which is outrageous  Lucky…"
June 2023,Gong bar,"Went to Gong bar for drinks with a friend to celebrate a new job. Had a wonderful time there with excellent drink recommendations and chat from Jamie and Daniel! Hope to be back again soon, thanks guys!"
May 2023,Fabulous Lunch with views at Ting,Great views of London. First visit to The Shard restaurant Ting and won’t be the last.  We enjoyed a fabulous three course lunch and drinks with delightful exceptional service from Mathios. Who made our day a very memorable one.  So thank you to Mathios 
June 2023,Best experience with Mathias!,"Mathias was the best today! He was thoughtful, professional and accommodated our groups dietary needs. We will definitely come back and visit for the afternoon tea experience at the Shard/Ting. Thanks!!"
June 2023,Shoutout to Dave 😄,"We came to the Shard for a few afternoon drinks, and wanted to give a shout-out to Dave, who was warm, welcoming and friendly the whole time! He checked on us frequently and ensured that our drinks were served promptly. Thank you Dave! 💐"
May 2023,An Amazing Experience,"Everything about this experience was amazing! I had not planned to do it here beforehand, but the night was made to feel so special that I proposed to my partner here (luckily she said yes!). The customer service from the moment we walked into The Shard was excellent. It is an intimate setting with fantastic views out on to London. The sun set while we were there, which led to some lovely viewing during our meal. I had the burger for my main and I am not exaggerating when I say it is the best burger I have ever eaten! The price is on the expensive side, but that is to be expected for the experience. Compared to other menus I saw in The Shard, Sky Lounge were quite fair. We both had a main, a dessert, a drink, a bottle of water for the table and paid the service charge - this…"
June 2023,Beautiful Hotel with fantastic views of London,"Back from a fantastic stay at the Shangri La. I booked a one night stay for my  husbands surprise 50th birthday and we stayed in an Iconic city view room. It  was amazing! The views are beautiful, you can see everything, and it only gets better at night. We had such a lovely time here, the staff were so attentive and helpful. We did not have our evening meal hear sadly as I wish  we had, however the breakfast was lovely, everything you could think of was displayed on the buffet. Yes it is pricey but this was a special occasion and we have made some Iconic memories here, so thank you Shangri la. Hopefully we shall be back again.  Also the infinity pool was so calm and relaxing!"
June 2023,The king of afternoon teas!,We had a wonderful time at the Shangri-La. My wife and I enjoyed an incredible vegan afternoon tea which was attentively served by Elvis. They were very accommodating to our allergies and preferences and were very helpful. We highly recommend this experience if you’re fortunate to be able to do it. The view is brilliant too!
June 2023,Ting Restaurant,"What can I say about our visit to Ting except that it was amazing. We were looked after by Elvis, his attention to detail and attentive service were exceptional. The food was amazing. The views spectacular. We both feel this was the best restaurant meal we have had. And the service is just out of this world. We felt so special from the moment we walked through the door until the moment we left. Everybody here is so customer focused and such a credit to Ting. You must visit!"
May 2023,Gong it is!,"Visited Gong Bar with friends whilst in London, Antonino and Davide took great care of us and made our evening extra special with the professional service and always smiling. Will definitely return ! "
June 2023,London from a whole new viewpoint,"Stunning view - world class and so worth seeing London from this view point, even if you've lived and worked here for many years. Breathtaking. Excellent food and wine. Great ambience, and exceptionally well looked after by Syed. Thank you for making a special night so anjoyable! "
May 2023,Great night out,"Can’t beat the view - 35 floors up.  Food was amazing, needless to say. Syed at the Tings was very helpful, he knew the menu very well and  his recommendations cannot be faulted. Sour sop ice cream was incredible! We had a lovely evening and a great way to spend our 31st wedding anniversary."
June 2023,Ma che vista !!! Amazing views,Amazing view and service  We have the signature noodles and it was delicious and very tasty  Don’t worry about the prices they are reasonable and in line with the view  (Syed is the best!)  Thank you 
June 2023,Amazing view and bartenders!,"The gong is a very fancy place and they let you know it through the attitude of the people there and the prices, the most expensive I ever saw for cocktails. But that's was still an amazing experience, thanks to the view and the 2 wonderful bartenders, Dani and Davide. They have been lovely with us all night long, and very attentive and managed everything so we can have nice pictures to remember this nice moment. A big thank to them!"
June 2023,View from our table at the Ting Restaurant. ,The 3 course meal was bought for me by my wife as a 70th birthday present and we both thoroughly enjoyed the evening. The food was excellent and could not be faulted. The staff were very efficient and pleasant. It was wonderful to have such an amazing view along the River Thames from our table. Overall a very nice evening. 
June 2023,The Shard ,"Ok so please don’t leave London without coming to eat here. It was amazing. I had the 5 course meal and it got better and better each time. Emilio was my server and he was amazing. Emilio was polite, very professional, friendly, knowledgeable of the dishes. I am so glad he was my server. Also Zoran was so nice and polite. They made my dining experience amazing. I felt very comfortable to eat solo. They were very welcoming. The chef Marcin needs a race (smile) because he cooks like a God. I am not exaggerating it was so good. I really recommend you eat here. Thank you all for a delicious dinner and a wonderful experience. "
May 2023,The best of London!,This is an amazing hotel. The architecture and design are amazing. Best of all — the staff are as welcoming and friendly as you could imagine. Just a great hotel!!! The service is great. The restaurants and bars are extraordinary. Can’t rate more highly. 
May 2023,Special thanks to Hashendri,It was amazing experience . All the team members of TING are really nice. Specially I want to thanks MRS Hashendri Who made my day and plan my whole plan .give me amazing lunch experience . She is amazing 😍
May 2023,*PLEASE READ* Hotel amazing - but be CAREFUL with what you get charged for,"I had a fantastic stay - hotel is amazing, staff very friendly, hotel itself is high quality as you would expect for a hotel of this calibre and price. However, how this hotel handles your money is very poor - I highly recommend you are very cautious and keep a close eye on transactions. I paid the full room rate on check in of over £1700 with a debit card. First issue - they add on a 5% service charge, so the amount you are told when booking, make sure you add on 5% which they don't tell you about (I was quoted £1620 and got charged £1701). Secondly, they tried putting a pre-authorisation of £400 on top when I checked in. I disputed this, eventually they agreed not to - but they completely emptied the mini bar before we were allowed in the room...As if I am going to steal a…"

May 2023,Lovely!,"Hi! I want to give a balanced honest review: I loved my stay!   The Pros:  The staff at the hotel are amazing. You can tell they are highly trained and are basically experts in hospitality. They do their best to remember any issues/orders/allergies you may have. It’s lovely to see people just shining in their jobs they way they do. They address you by name, try to be discrete. They’re excellent.  The rooms are lovely, large, spotless and of course the views (you already know). They surprise you throughout your stay with high quality snacks and chocolate. 😍 Pampered.  Breakfast buffet was amazing. High quality produce served. High quality dishes served with a lovely range.   Beautiful pool area.  A few things that can be improved on: The internet 😭 I think this might be because…"
May 2023,"Great View, Service and Food",The food was marvellous along with the service. Our server was Sara who was delightful. She was very helpful in all fields and made our night a total success. Sofija and Zoran were also extremely helpful. The fillet was wonderfully cooked
May 2023,Guest Relations very disapointing,"So disappointed, this was our 3rd visit to Shangri-La Shard in a year and always spoke well of the hotel but guest relations left us very disapointed. Guest Relations had swiped our card twice when we made a payment unbeknown to us. When my husband went to the bank to withdraw some money he couldn't because  Shangri-La had there second payment impending. So we had no money in our account. I phoned Guest Relations and explained there mistake I was told that someone would ring me back but they didn't . I phoned Guest Relations and again I was told that someone would ring me or email me later that day, I heard nothing from them. On the 3rd day I phoned my bank because we do not have Internet banking so was not aware if the payment had been sent back  the payment was sent back into…"
June 2023,Afternoon Tea with a View!!,"This was such a wonderful, well spent afternoon!! Everything was absolutely perfect from the food to the drinks to the tea. Every bite was delicious, and the tea and drinks complemented the food very well. Service was excellent as well, special thanks to Elvis, who really looked after us and made the experience that much more enjoyable!!. Also, thank you to the person who took our booking, they put us at a lovely table, which had a perfect view!! Really made our Anniversary special!! "
May 2023,Amazing view with cool cocktails,GONG at 52nd floor Shangrila London.  What a spectacular view. What amazing cocktails. Special mention for Sucheta who made us comfortable and welcomed us with so much warmth. Ensured once the tables are released we got the table with aging tower Bridge view. Highly recommended for a late night drink and a relaxed evening. 
May 2023,Day trip for the Swimming pool and Spa,My first time I had to go like airport style security than a lift on the 35 level. I check in than a other lift to the swimming pool and spa area. There no changing rooms you have to use the toilets. there small lockers there. I like the big clean fluffy towels. I used the gym and swimming pool and sauna. There free hot drinks and an orange and water. The place was very clean the staff were very friendly. 
June 2023,Awesome,"Everything was perfect, we took the five course and realloc enjoyed it! Dave was an excellent waiter, very concerned. He made our experience very special. I recommend it ! You can also enjoy the beautiful view :)"
June 2023,Truly outstanding service and an excellent culinary mic experience,"We were very lucky to be attended by Dave, who we learned was only 2 months in service for the TING. He has been truly outstanding in his attendance, attitude and knowledge of every course.  There is nothing better to elevate an exquisite culinary experience than an outstanding service. Thank you to the chef and thank you to Dave."
May 2023,First Time and First Day in London!,"As soon as I walked in, I was wowed. From the detailed decorations to the amazing hospitality. I was pleasantly surprised to see a welcome message written on the window, accompanied with yummy maccroons. This was such a perfect touch and really made me feel cared for. And ofcourse I had to visit the sauna and pool, it was so peaceful and perfect after a long day of travel. And the food was absolutely lovely, the brunch has such variety and was delish. Thank you so much to everyone who assisted me with my stay, especially to Gabriel, Tyrone, Eva, Dinil, Andrea, and Bruno. Your great energy and care really made my stay one of a kind. Thank you Shangri-La for such a beautiful experience, can't wait to visit again in the future!"
June 2023,Totally Incompetent Management,After a previous disaster we decided to give this Hotel a second chance ???  It’s worse we are still waiting after one hour at 3 pm to gain access to a very expensive suite and things have got worse  The Front of House Manager is incompetent and clearly lost  Never ever again a very poor reflection on a great Brand  Ian Kinga Lily
June 2023,"Breakfast At Ting, Amazing ","The Shangri La, London as always was superb. From Concierge to reception to Ting, everybody greeted us, smiled at us and spoke with us. The hotel looked lovely and smelt lovely with essence of Shangri La. We had a nice table by the window with outstanding London views and superb service throughout from Elvis who was on hand for everything we needed. The breakfast buffet was amazing with everything you could want for. The whole experience was great and looking forward o returning very soon. Thank you to everyone at Shangri La London. "
June 2023,Birthdays in the clouds,"Dave was very accommodating and attentive, the scene was otherworldly and the food delicious…couldn’t of had it better. Providing a blissful break from his A level revision we celebrated my son’s 18th birthday shared with my daughter’s 21st, with heads in the cloud it provided a serene evening from busy daily reality so all I can say is thank you…really."
May 2023,Fantastic experience,We stayed here on our wedding night and the staff really couldn’t do enough for us - they went above and beyond to make our stay special. The hotel itself is great and the rooms have everything including a view! The pool on 52 floor is also pretty cool. Would definitely recommend staying here
May 2023,Great service at the Gōng Bar,"Excellent service by Anbu at the Gōng bar, very nice experience. The food was tasty and the drinks of course are great too. They were accommodating in getting us and other guests a window view. A must-do experience for anyone visiting London. "
May 2023,Lovely service,"Lovely service from Anbu and Antonino, both so friendly and helpful. The views were also really good, we sat at a window seat. Also very grateful we got in a last minute reservation as they were booked out tonight. Make sure to book in advance "
May 2023,Gong Bar,"I booked the Gong lounge bar, as a last minute date night. I was very impressed, and a bit disappointed that I hadn’t been here before. Ultimately the best views of London by far. I was greeted by a lovely lady in red (Sucheta). She tried her upmost to immediately accommodate us by a window seat. Unfortunately there wasn’t any available at the time. Later on in the evening a few couples departed, and Sucheta had us upgraded to a corner aspect view of London. This was breathtaking. My wife so impressed. We ordered 2 snack dishes to nibble on, they were decent. The drinks were nice too. The waiters were all very polite, and not pushy at all. Overall this was a great experience. I will also be visiting the Oblix and Aqua Shard soon!"
April 2023,Welcoming and professional. I felt at home. Thank you.,"I was at the launch of a book, #Fab collab nearby waiting for a friend.  Roxana and Otabek at Bar 31 where very welcoming and helpful. I had a great time choosing the right wine...between a French and a Spanish. I chose the French. It had more body. "
May 2023,Experience gone well thanks to Anbu,"We came here to celebrate our friend’s birthday and Anbu Theo Mada gave us the best time! Not only he accommodated us with a window table, but he also recommended really good cocktails and offered us complimentary shots to celebrate. The setting is also amazing and the staff is remarkable. "
May 2023,Perfect special occasion dinner,We went for dinner at Ting & whilst not cheap we felt the 5 course whimsical menu was excellent value for money in combination with the setting. Lovely range of dishes using seasonal British ingredients with an oriental twist. Service was outstanding from Dave & the team - friendly & great attention to detail without being pushy. Interesting wine list including a great Chinese rose! 
May 2023,Best Dinner In London,Dinner was great. I had the pork and jasmine rice. Best pork ever had and the portions were perfect. The dessert options were great as well and the chocolate did not taste sugary. Super dining experience led by Syed at Ting.
May 2023,Beautiful sunset at the shard,Great food and great service! Everything was delicious and the view was phenomenal. Our waiter Dave was very welcoming and attentive. I highly recommend the shard and i have no complaints about the service. Will be coming back the next time I visit London. 
May 2023,Superb Spring of Love Afternoon Tea,"It has been a while since our last visit and this time we brought our two young sons. The Shard is a special place for my wife and I, as I proposed to her there.   We had a great table at the window and staff were amazing from the moment we walked in. The finger sandwiches were delicious and the  small deserts and pastries were small pieces of art. The views from the 35th floor never bores me and our oldest son loved watching the trains go by down at London Bridge Station. Our oldest son had fish and chips as a children’s menu and it honestly was one of the best fish and chips I tasted. The batter of the cod was nothing less than crispy perfection.   The selection of teas on offer were superb and we were encouraged to try as much of them as possible. Especially the masala tea…"
May 2023,Memorable Birthday Experience,"I celebrated my golden birthday here after my partner surprised me with reservations, and it was a truly memorable experience! We had a beautiful view of Tower Bridge. Our server Dave was especially kind and attentive."
May 2023,Great food and great service ,"We went for my husband’s birthday. Greatest experience. The food was scrumptious, the service by Syed was great. He was very attentive and kind. The ambience was very pleasant.  We will definitely visit again. "
May 2023,Delicious dinner and drinks,Dining here was incredible and Amy organised it beautifully. The whole experience was absolutely amazing from start to finish. As soon as we walked through the doors everyone was so  welcoming  and friendly. The food was spectacular and there was a variety of plant based options. The atmosphere Amy created with her interactions with everyone made  it feel so comfortable and at ease. The cocktails were delicious and the bartender was great with a super sense of humour. An overall 10/10 what a fantastic birthday experience thank you so much. 
May 2023,Ting Restaurant was amazing. Sara was a wonderful hostess,"Sara was a wonderful waitress/server. Very attentive and friendly. Sava was a great bartender, thoroughly enjoyed our drinks. The bloody orange cocktail was delicious. I would highly recommend, the Malaysian rice dish was amazing"
April 2023,World class experience,"I've been fortunate enough to stay in quite a few nice hotels and after a while you start to get a feel for what a 5* experience actually is, regardless of how many stars they claim to have. Shangri-La Shard can certainly walk the walk. (My only criticism is that the door to our room and a few others had a sort of leather covering, which is peeling, but that didn't diminish our experience once inside the room.)  So what made it so good? The views. The views. The views. Most of the walls -- as you'd expect -- are glass and we enjoyed the most spectacular sunset. On to the bathroom: good bathroom products (L'Occitane!), perfect placement of the bath for that wow factor -- panoramic views of London while you soak --  and even the toilet! It always warm and it even washes your…"
May 2023,Hues of Culture !!,"We went with my family to have some drinks, we tried the new menu that was launched today and recommandation from the bartenders Kyriakos and Dani were the best! We had an amazing night, plus the service from Anbu was making the night even more enjoyable ! Funny and unforgettable experience ! Thank you so much Gong Team !"
May 2023,Nice view but overall disappointing,Rooms below par cleanliness  Overall finish of rooms not great and starting to look tired  Told we had breakfast then upon  arrival refused which was embarrassing  Overall not the experience we were expecting and will be looking to stay elsewhere in future in our return to London 
May 2023,Anniversary night,"Well what can I say, this place certainly didn't disappoint.from the moment we pulled up in a car, to the ease of check in, the friendliness and accommodating staff to the most exquisite room I've ever stayed in. The decor around the whole establishment was fantastic, the room itself was out of this world with  stunning views. The bed was mahoosive, I thought I'd lost my wife in it when I woke up and couldn't see her. The automatic blinds are a great touch and nake you feel you're staying somewhere special. The bath in the bathroom is first class, and the views you get whilst sitting in it are stunning. The heated automatic toilet is something else. The only gripe I have about the room is that the windows on the outside of the structure needed a good clean in places as the dirt…"
May 2023,Awesome experience ... thank you,"The view was stunning... we enjoyed the 5 course menu which was exceptionnel, the service was excellent. Thank you Syed for the excellent and attentive service. We were very glad for this experience. We'd love to come back."
April 2023,Surprise for my Wife,"I booked this as a surprise for my Wife and have to say it was worth every penny. We stayed for 2 nights on level 45 overlooking St Pauls Cathedral from the bedroom. The customer service in this hotel is excellent, from the moment we checked in nothing was too much trouble. We were made to feel special and that's rare these days even in so called 5 star hotels. The room was immaculate and we were fortunate to have a bath by the window. Would highly recommend requesting this even if it costs extra. Yes this hotel is expensive but its a unique experience and one that will never be forgotten. Will we return? Definitely. One of the finest hotels in the world without doubt. "
May 2023,Wedding anniversary visit,"I recently celebrated our wedding anniversary at this hotel and I cannot speak highly enough of the staff and services provided. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with warm smiles and genuine care from the front desk team who kindly congratulated us on our special occasion. Me and my partner would wholeheartedly recommend this establishment as it's got a very good location with great views of London Landmarks. Can't fault anything. Comfortable beds and having breakfast served directly in your room was the top of our experience. ❤️❤️❤️"
May 2023,SUPERB Service,"Fantastic view, we enjoy the food and nice covktails,superb service by the Skylounge team.  they explain the food, recommended which cocktail is nice with you food.

We enjoyed dinner at Ting with lovely views of Tower Bridge. Food was tasty and served timeously.  The pool was lovely. Gong Bar was very vibey and had an enjoyable experience there too.

April 2023,An overall amazing experience!,"We have booked a table for my mom’s birthday and it was an experience that she won’t forget any time soon.  The food was amazing the cocktails were great, we have been looked after by Madalina who is the floor manager and her colleague Anbu. I can not express in words how grateful I was about the service and the mesmerising view of London from the 52’nd floor.   I highly recommend for anyone who what’s to make a special day to someone or any kind of celebrations over a nice drink and dinner.   I would like to thank one more time to Madalina and Anbu who made our experience one of a kind and for ever memorable!   Cristian U."

One of the supervisor, Jose was very kind and hospitable. The manager from Ting restaurant took good care of us while dining. This place exceeded all my expectations.  I’m so excited and looking forward  to coming back with my family in October! "

May 2023,Amazing hotel,"The best Hotel in London by far. I have been here multiple times whether for business or pleasure and it always exceeds my expectations.

May 2023,Syed was an amazing host!,Ting offers an amazing experience of afternoon tea at the 35th floor overlooking London’s skyline and historic landmarks.

Would highly recommend for anyone looking for a one of a kind dinner experience with one of the best views in the city! ❤️ also a very special thank you to our reservation host, we were a large group and they graciously accommodated us upon arrival-  we had a reservation but last minute we had to adjust the group size. Will definitely return the next time we are in…"
May 2023,An elevated experience worth every penny.,The absolute best black pepper beef I've ever had. There was not a single miss on the table.

The view only added to the entire experience. 
May 2023,Shard,Perfect experience with Dave!!! Thank you so much for everything!!!! This was the best restraunt I have ever been to and the most surreal experience. Will definitely be coming again just for daves amazing customer service. Overall the food was 10/10 but Dave was 100/10.

May 2023,Pleasent evening birthday date!,"We celebrates my partner’s birthday at the Ting Restaurant, Shard and we were looked after by waitress named Sara. Not only the food was gorgeous AND delicious, Sara made our evening extra special with her warm hearted personality! She knew the meals very well, clearly described to us. Despite being in a fine dining restaurant, we felt homely with Sara’s expression while giving us (my partner mainly as he eats fooood for 4 people!!!) complimentary bread every after each course of a meal! Would love to return and be served by lovely Sara ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
April 2023,Excellent experience at Sky Lounge thanks also to the staff ,"I had the pleasure of having drinks with friends at the Sky Launge and was delighted with two things.

April 2023,Another beautiful stay,"Another beautiful stay at this wonderful hotel. Took my mum for her third stay here over the Easter break  and we had a lovely time yet again. The service has gone slightly downhill since they opened, but it’s still much better than most places in the UK. We did have to wait 45 mins for a scone when our room wasn’t ready to check in to. But the staff took it off the bill so we honestly didn’t mind. Also had to wait 2.5 hours for room service to bring us some tea bags one night.   And the vegan food at Ting is still pretty dismal (not really sure why it never improves. Just for a comparison we went to the Savoy for afternoon tea and wow was the vegan food amazing!).   Also just a funny note. I am 7 months pregnant, and the front of house staff sent the most beautiful bouquet of…"

We had arrived early and Silvia had enabled that we were able to check in as soon as we arrived. She was polite and friendly and was always striving to give us the best possible experience. She informed us that she had been able to upgrade our room to a deluxe city view room which was welcomed greatly. The room was outstanding. It was clean and all amenities which were required were available. We had requested a cake prior to our arrival however due to an error, this could not be facilitated. Staff went out of their way to ensure that we had other items in place of this and was quickly rectified. We had made reservations at the Gong bar. Staff were friendly and polite and explained…"

We booked the deluxe city view room which was worth it just for the bathroom, it had a free-standing bathtub with 360 views of the city. The room was well-equipped and spotlessly clean, I would 100% recommend the in-room dining. We opted for breakfast and it made the experience even more special. The menu was great and also had lots of gluten-free options (they can switch out most ingredients to accommodate and even had gluten-free bread). We ate dinner at Ting which again accommodated different dietary requirements. The wine list was a little pricey,…"

We received great service from Jenny, Dev, and Dinil. During our last breakfast, our 5 year old son asked Jenny if he can have chocolate chip pancakes. Chefs Angelito and Lucio made a 5 year old boy’s day before the long journey back to San Francisco.   The bellman at arrival, I believe his name is Angelo was very friendly to talk to.

The views are incredible (as perhaps expected) although occasionally disconcerting.  The service for me was perhaps the pinnacle. I couldn't have asked for better, from the moment we were checked in, to seeing staff around the hotel who always stopped to say hello and the very responsive team when calling. Honestly, this is a great credit to the place and I thoroughly recommend on this alone. Leah who checked me in was excellent.  I highly recommend this place as treat to stay. We were lucky enough to book the pool for when the sun was setting, watching the lights come on over London.  We had a room overlooking the South, I have to say I thought this view was…"

February 2023,GREAT VIEWS VERSUS POORSOUNDPROOFING,Undeniably fantastic views and the service at breakfast and at reception was exellent. The infinity pool and sauna was fab and there plenty of staff on hand.

Overall our experience has been very positive with a beautiful room, a charming welcome in our room and of course the amazing views.   A couple of weeks before our arrival I booked a meal (which was part of our package for one night) at Ting, and advised it was our anniversary.

Yes the view from the room was fantastic & the room was as good as you get - unfortunately the weekend we went the pool and spa were closed for maintenance so we didn’t get to enjoy that.    "

December 2022,Save your money stay elsewhere !!,"If I could, I would give a -0 review  The service here is absolutely infuriating! If you email the hotel you receive 10 different replies from 10 different staff members.  There is zero communication amongst them.  That is the start.   We then are advised it’s a 4pm check in.  Guess what - no check in at 4pm - room isn’t ready! They can’t get a hold of housekeeping either conveniently!  So we had to sit and wait with a child.  The sad part is it wasn’t just us, I noticed so many different people having the exact same conversation with the check in staff.   I felt so terrible for the check in staff as they were trying their absolute best.    When we finally got our room they lost our luggage and couldn’t find it.   Let’s just say this is the most disappointing experience I have…"

The hotel, itself, is gorgeous and the staff are all super friendly and helpful. The rooms are beautiful and the views are simply amazing. We arrived pretty late, as we had a daytime flight from the US to London, and upon arrival everything was ready for our check-in. We ordered room service as most restaurants nearby were already closed. Room service was prompt and good (although a bit expensive), it was very nice to have this option since we just needed to eat and go to bed. The room was a bit warm for us, but after contacting the front desk,…"

October 2022,Amazing afternoon Tea!!,"Went to the Afternoon Tea at Ting Restaurant in Shangri-La and wasn’t expecting much. But wow! Firstly, this month’s theme was Breast Cancer Awareness and the Shangri-La did it perfectly! Not only were the decorations beautiful, but the afternoon tea had a pink theme with pink sandwiches, cakes and scones, as well as a spiced pear and white chocolate shard cake (which was both beautiful and delicious!) Everything was made perfectly, and I found myself eating foods I wouldn’t usually eat because they somehow managed to make everything taste so good!  Additionally, the service was absolutely incredible from the moment we walked through the door. A special shout-out to our amazing server Kiro who looked after us from start to finish, he didn’t rush us and constantly made sure…"
February 2022,Has become a tradition to come at least once a year.,"Stayed at the shard three times beautiful views of London! Wonderful staff, nice and helpful. The pool is amazing, although a bit chilly during the winter time but the sauna helps you warm back up! The buffet in the morning is great, lots of delicious choice. The rooms are fantastically cleaned, they go in detail such as fold your clothes or even put your makeup back in place and leave the room impeccable, with services in the morning and at night, the rooms come with complimentary water and chocolates or even deserts sometimes. I love it there and will definitely be back soon ! Cannot wait. (Ps: Don’t forget to watch the tv hidden in the mirror while taking a bath and/ or people watch with the binoculars in the room.) "

October 2022,Will be back on the basis of the service alone,"TīNG itself is known for its beautifully curated menu. The food was impeccable to say the least. I had the wagyu and it was the best meal I’ve ever had. However, the basis of this review relies solely on the service of staff like Kiro.

The rooms were excellent the staff were very friendly and helpful, As an international hotel i understand the need for different nationality of staff but we struggled to understand the person that checked us in. The main reason for choosing this hotel was the night views which were spectacular from the room.

Would recommend and come back!"
October 2022,Rooftop bar,"Kyriakos and Michela gave exemplary service and provided on site knowledge to the Shangri la's roof top bar menu, gave advice as to what we may prefer, and provided a consistent repoire that made us feel welcome.

October 2022,Tingtastic,Came for the 5-course tasting and decided on the plant-based (even though not a vegan) and couldn’t have been happier.  Jing was a great server and host. Very attentive to our needs as were all the staff.  Each course was better than the previous. The views were icing on the cake. 35th floor Tower Bridge & Tower of London in the background complemented a great meal.  Should be on everyone’s list to try.
October 2022,"Jing, the most beautiful waitress","The most attentive waitress… I never went without.  What a beautiful experience with Jing.   She made the meal. What a pleasure.

THANK YOU SYED! "
October 2022,Afternoon Tea Experience @ the Ting’s,"Where else would I like to spend an afternoon tea experience of a lifetime but from where the afternoon tea originated itself. Plus an aerial view of the city of London hence the choice of having it only at the Shangri-La The Shard London last October 3, 2022 visit despite other best selections of venue. One of my bucket list was checked off. The sets of food served from savory sandwiches to beautifully assembled desserts were delicious & the unlimited refills of any tea selections were refreshing. The request for the smoky effect on our table was an added flair too. To top it all, the optional request for having a table by the window during the reservation was granted despite the hesitancy of the lady at the reception even when it’s available was questionable. But with the…"
September 2022,A great birthday experience with amazing drinks ! !,We had a great memorable experience for my father's birthday celebration ! Madalina and Louis looks after us while the drinks that Davide and Michela made for us were great in Taste and beautifull! 😍

October 2022,5 course menu with Syed,"We came to dinner for the 5 course menu, and it was a phenomenal experience. The food was super great, and the service was extra awesome! Our server was Syed and Leon, and I don't have enough characters to say how professional and courteous they both were. We were greeted with warm genuine smiles and they didn't mind taking so many photos (that we asked for 🤣). Needless to say I highly recommend this place for it's food, view, and amazing service. I would recommend 10/10."
October 2022,Six stars!,"This is perhaps the best hotel my wife and I have ever stayed at. We just returned after a fantastic four-day stay - I ran the London Marathon and always enjoy the city. We had just stayed at a five-star, historic hotel (the Sofitel Grand) in Amsterdam and the Shangri-La was even better. The architecture is stunning. Our room, the Premier City View (which I would recommend that side for the drop-dead views of the city, Tower and Tower Bridge), was perfect. The bed, sofa, desk, artwork, electric black-out shades, carpet, gorgeous marble and granite bathroom, closets, and quiet - could not have been better. The hotel left us a bottle of champagne, cake, chocolates, and even a laminated sign with waterproof bandaids (fortunately not needed but still) and vaseline (for chafing),…"
October 2022,A good experience overall,"Syed provided really good service and the views were great.  The only let downs were the starters and mains - expected better.  The dessert was 10/10, I would definitely come back for the views and dessert"

September 2022,Excellent but be aware!,"We stayed here for 2 nights in the middle of September for our Wedding Anniversary, this was the 4th or 5th time we had stayed at this hotel.  We had a superior room on the 46th Floor overlooking Tower Bridge, this was more spacious than the standard room. Excellent views from our room, and the room was as it should be.  On the positive side, we were able to check in at 2.00pm which I had requested prior to checkin.  The stay itself was excellent, the views are unrivalled, service whilst staying was excellent, breakfast was good and the staff in the Gong Bar provided excellent service.  But on the negative side we had a couple of issues...  1) I had booked the skyline lounge for Saturday night about six weeks prior to our stay, and 5 days before our arrival I had an email to say…"

September 2022,Stunning Views from Our Bed!,"We stayed in one of their amazing City View rooms. It really was the most stunning view from the wall of floor to ceiling windows. So many iconic London sites could be seen such as Tower Bridge, Tower of London, St. Paul’s Cathedral, the London Eye, etc. At night, with all of the lights, it was beautiful. We woke each morning to the sunrise over the city. I took some wonderful photos at 05:30!  The room & bathroom were amazing & had everything we needed. It was all very modern & ‘James Bond’ with a TV within the bathroom mirror, & other gadgets. The only thing that let the main room down was the relatively low spec old TV with very limited viewing options. It just didn’t fit in with the rest of the room. I’ve read that they call them designer TVs but it just wasn’t. It was so…"
September 2022,Brilliant venue for corporate event,"We had a new product launch event in the LI Room for one of my clients last week. The venue is stunning - views across London to die for - 34th floor of the Shard, the Shangri-La Hotel. The customer service levels were very high and the quality of the food supplied was quite outstanding. Our guests were blown away by it even those who had been to similar events there before! If you're looking for a quality venue in London this is it. Thanks to Yasmin for her patience as we moved towards finalising everything we needed for the day!"

September 2022,Worst experience ever,"We decided to stay at this hotel after a week away in Switzerland and have a nice relaxing experience before returning to work. We checked into the hotel and made reservations for the aqua shard. After about 20 minutes, the lights stopped working and the curtains stopped working. We spent most of the night on the phone dealing with this, they sent an engineer to the room who made one of us do his job by flicking with the breaker. We missed our dinner reservation because of this and ordered room service. The lights then stopped working again, we called them and they offered to send the same engineer who clearly didn’t know what he was doing. In the morning the bathroom lights were not working. Could not see myself at all. We explained this to them on check out that we were very…"

July 2022,"Exceptional service, fantastic food and  stunning views!","I've stayed at The Shard several times over the past few months and was astounded by the quality of the service, food and scenic views. On all occasions, save my last stay, I had the pleasure of being checked-in and checked-out by Marta Martin, an incredible receptionist at the from desk. I mentioned to her I was a photographer and she called up at sunset to advise to come to the lobby to view the amazing scenic views. I really appreciate her personal touch. My last stay unfortunately, was not as pleasant on the service end but I am treating that as an anomaly for now.  The food at the Ting is to die for! I would suggest the Ting Burger and Chicken Cesar - combined they are simply exquisite. It is quite odd as the room service Ting Burger and Cesar Salad seemed more flavourful…"
August 2022,"Great service, lovely views and exciting  cocktails","We visited Gong to celebrate our dad's birthday. It was a great evening.  The cocktails were innovative and views were great. To top everything the service was exceptional. We were seated by Alina who was extremely kind.  Alina gave us a great table and ensured our parents had a wonderful time.

I would highly recommend this dinner as a great experience in London and the highlight of our trip.
October 2021,Fabulous views - Thanks Shangri-La,"We stayed in one of the suites for our anniversary. The view was ASTOUNDING. We were able to see the sun rise and sun set from either side of the room with the panoramic views which made it extra special. We dined at the restaurants and bar within the hotel, we had a lovely dinner with live piano played in the background, great atmosphere and ambience. The infinity pool was fabulous and views again were amazing. It’s a rather expensive stay but I think we’ll worth the ££££ if you want to make some special memories."

The staff were so lovely and very helpful, especially Jing!  Will be returning definitely!"
August 2022,Disappointing,"Views aside, the Hotel was disappointing. The rooms are looking tired, there is a price hike on everything (which I understand to some extent but everything you touch costa money…as if the rooms weren’t expensive enough). The shower leaked, the plug socket was broken and we expected more modern tech (streaming Netflix at the least). I guess it is similar to buying luxury clothes, there’s only so much value until you’re getting the same quality but paying for the name. There was nothing special about this Hotel and I regret spending so much money on what was supposed to be an extraordinary anniversary celebration."

August 2022,Utopia in vibrant London,We stayed with our young family in two connecting rooms on the 42nd floor. Superb view of the city. Spacious rooms and the connection through the hallway (which we could lock with an extra door) made it even more comfortable. Kids were provided with funny and entertaining set of toys. All required amenities available. Delightful pool with kids hours and off course brilliant view
August 2022,Amazing Afternoon Tea,We have just had the most amazing Afternoon Tea at Tring Restaurant The Shard. The sandwiches and cakes were out of this world. It was my husband’s birthday so it was a special occasion. Our waitress called Jenny was outstanding. From the moment we arrived she went out of her way to make us feel welcome and anything we asked for was not a problem. My son is a bit of a fussy eater and only likes egg sandwiches. Jenny made sure he had plenty and nothing was too much trouble. I can honestly say she made our experience so fantastic. She was truly exceptional and she is a real credit to Tring. The whole experience from the window seat to the food was superb and we will definitely be back. We highly recommend!! Thank you
August 2022,The Sky lounge The Shard,"The Sky Lounge in the Shard London has the most excellent staff. I dealt with a professional young member of the team Paulo, he was considerate, attentive and so helpful infact with the knowledge that it was my daughters 21st bday he informed me of a service they could offer. He organised a cake to be made informing me of the size and price in advance and checked my daughters name( unusual spelling) to make sure it was correct. His greeted us personally on the day and his staff were outstanding! Couldn’t recommend it enough, well done and thank you👍🏻"
August 2022,Luxury with a view,"I grew up in London and thought I’d seen it all. But after returning after five years away in Sydney, the Shangri-La has given me a new perspective on my home city. The service is immaculate from check-in with Sonia to check-out with a hundred exquisite details in between. I could sit and drink cocktails on the 52nd floor for hours, spotting places I’ve visited over the years as the sun goes down. Thank you."
August 2022,The service and the food was good all round from beginning to end. Would recommend others to go and try Shanghai-La.,This was a great experience from beginning to end. From first greeting to being tabled. The food was well prepared. Delivered and the staff are well knowledgeable about what is being provided. I would recommend to try if visiting london. Atleast once.

There was an amazing view that amazed us all and you could see miles of the city! The sweets in particular were a hit with our family and we all greatly enjoyed our time. I would highly recommend this to everyone visiting London!"
July 2022,Perfect lunch experience,"I took my parents to the TING restaurant in the Shard, which was the perfect lunch experience. If you arrive early you can already walk around the Shangi-La reception area and take in the stunning views. We must have taken 30 pictures or so before we even entered the restaurant. The atmosphere is very high end lounge style and the food is fantastic. We had the 3 course menu which offers good choice and portions, in my view. Try the Spiced Cod & Salmon Croquettes as a side - even my father, who thinks he doesn’t like fish, enjoyed them (without knowing what he was eating). And the Chocolate & Miso dessert is not to be missed. Our waiter Alex was also great, happy, fast and very attentive. He even refused a tip on the grounds that he brought out one wrong starter (which only…"
July 2022,"Wow, wow, wow!","Ahead of my visit I emailed to request that staff made a fuss of my daughter as we were visiting to celebrate her 18th birthday. I also asked for some help as I explained we were claustrophobic and I knew in particular I would struggle with the lift. From the moment we arrived outside staff were outstanding. They were reassuring about the lift journey being patient and answering my endless questions and even held my hand as we travelled the 35 floors to reception. When we arrived at check in, I felt dizzy as my ears popped in the lift and I was still feeling anxious about the enclosed lift. Multiple staff stopped what they were doing and came to offer more reassurance and water. They understood the situation and immediately moved our room to a lower floor. When I was ready staff…"
July 2022,Shangri-La Champagne Afternoon Tea,"I booked this experience with Virgin for my partners birthday. On arrival we was greeted promptly and seated by the window with an amazing view. Our waitress Jing was very attentive and polite. She added a personal touch by wishing my partner a happy birthday and adding an edible happy birthday sign to our afternoon tea deserts. The food was delicious! My favourite part was the edible shard!  Thank you so much Jing and all the staff, our experience was amazing and would highly recommend!"
July 2022,We had a stunning day at TING.,"Me and my husband went to shard for special date lunch; Afternoon tea.   I asked to get a seat next to the window when I book it. As we expected, we had next to the window that we could enjoy tower bridge view and all that jazz. The weather was so great and we maximumly enjoyed our dating time in TING.  Especially, It was lovely to serve our course by Jenny.  She show us great vibe, kindness and lovely smile. The service affects people a lot if they want to coming back again. Afternoon tea was also stunning. However, it was a bit disappointed afternoon tea course doesn’t including tea itself. Any drinks you need to order separately. And desserts are quite big portions so you might not finish all food. But still, we had great date lunch in there and such a lovely view and staff."
July 2022,Magnificent Experience!,"Me and my sister were very amazed by everything at The Ting. I would like to compliment Carlo, Giannis, Irina and Nathan for the fun and relaxing evening, as they made it much more enjoyable through good company and great service! Thank you, Shangri-La!"

July 2022,It's all about the views,"We stayed two nights in an Iconic City View room as a surprise for my wife's 50th birthday.  The hotel location is perfect, above London Bridge station for easy transport links, next to Borough Market with its food stalls and many restaurants and pubs and a five minute walk from the Thames.  The hotel reception is on the 35th floor with bedrooms between floors 36 and 51 and then the gym and pool plus GONG cocktail bar on floor 52.  The good bits:- = Location. = Our Iconic City View room was amazing, you really could spend hours just watching the boats on the river, always something to see. = Using the Sky Pool before breakfast. = Excellent service including turndown each night. = Complimentary bottle of bubbly and cake for my wife's birthday.  Not so good:- - Having to pre=book…"
July 2022,An incredible experience...,"Vincent and Nathaniel were our personal gourmet guides for our dining experience at Ting. The view from 35 floors up in the Shard was absolutely incredible. The service was incredibly attentive, lightly witty, and very knowledgeable. Every dish and drink was a testament to their perfection. It was not a great meal, or a great view, or amazing service. It was a truly fulfilling experience, in every aspect. I would come back for the service from Vincent and Nathaniel alone, but there was nothing I can say needed improvement. Bravo and cheers to everyone at Ting!"

July 2022,Superb!!,"My daughter and I were gifted a voucher from our work colleagues for the 5 course set menu at Ting for our 60th and 30th birthday. A truly memorable experience from start to finish. The food was amazing as was the attentiveness of our waiter Marlon. When we arrived at our table we were immediately asked if we would like to sit at a window table. The sommelier ( so sorry I can’t recall her name!) was wonderful and advised us on our choice of wine suggesting alternatives still within our original budget. The views are spectacular and the food and service is first class. We will definitely come here again soon and thoroughly recommend a visit,you won’t be disappointed."

May 2022,Amazing views,"Amazing views. Good service.  Truly lovely room.  But why spend £800 a night and then not expect the room to include breakfast? Such a weird penny pinching approach to pricing.    We loved the room, but honesty for £800 - throw in a bagel."
July 2022,Special occasion,"Family 6 meals  for hubby birthday treat.  Had three course menu for 5 adults and kid menu for a child.  It is a good value for money for the experience in shard. We was served by Helga who was really a star and very attentive, she was busy around with customers and tried her the best to ensure we be cared. Such nice hearted staff, I feel really thankful. Very thoughtful, Helga gave a sign “Happy Birthday “ card with sweets it made my hubby birthday so special at Ling restaurant. The view was outstanding with these delicate and delicious three course meals. We had a great time! Thank you very much xx"
July 2022,Is this really a Shangri-La??,Just checked in for a 6 day stay. Decoration classic Shangri-La but service was cold both at reception and at breakfast. Had to ask about my breakfast as they did not realize I’m a Diamond member. Just called them about my amenities. Again they said they have to check. Doesn’t feel like a Shangri-La at all and certainly don’t feel like a Diamond member here. Hopefully rest of stay is better.

July 2022,Afternoon Tea at The Ting,"From the moment we walked service was on point, we was looked after by Elvis who was very nice and attentive and helpful and ensured us everything they served us was halal. Elvis has also kindly given us a Birthday treat with a nice smoke show. What made the afternoon better was that Busta Rhymes was there and happen to saw a few lines on the mic. Overall great service and food and great selection of 52 teas."
July 2022,Best ever,"Amazing stay at the shard hotel. We were so well looked after throughout our stay. Jing was super attentive during breakfast at the Ting restaurant and organised a lovely surprise (plate of macarons) for our son who was celebrating finishing his GCSE's  .

July 2022,Great views but get there early for window seats on the weekend,"The team was super accommodating.  I needed to shift my reservation back slightly day of, making me miss the first round of seats by the windows.   Kiro was able to work magic and have me shifted towards the windows after the savory bites. He and the team were so sweet and attentive.   The food was nice, but the view was better and the live music was a great touch. Would come again!"

June 2022,Afternoon Tea in the Clouds~~~~☆☆☆☆☆,"I hadn't planned to have afternoon tea on my way to the shard,but the jumbotron advertisement enticed me. The hostess was very amicable and lovely. She seated me where I could see an unobstructed view of the London/Tower Bridge. And The Tower of London! Helga offered her expertise on which Champagne to add to the afternoon tea. The Superb Jenny gave me ☆☆☆☆☆ service. She is a true scholar in the art of tea, a tea sommelier if you will! All of her suggestions were delicious! My tea would not have been such a sublime experience without her. The chefs took my taste buds on a culinary ary adventure. The diverse flavor profiles and depth of the sandwiches were MIND BLOWING.  The creme for the scones was the best I've ever had. Very creamy, and a hint of sweet. The lime blueberry…"

June 2022,What a stay!,"I booked Shangri-la for a weekend stay for my husband’s birthday. When we arrived everyone was extremely helpful and when they found out we were already late for our brunch booking at Aqua, the reception staff made even more effort to quickly explain our benefits (booked through concierge to receive Golden Circle benefits) and send us on our way.  When we finished our brunch, the room was ready and we were informed that they upgraded us to a suite. When you enter your room at the Shangri-la, the curtains open to unveil the view of London. Staff wrote a lovely Happy Birthday note on a window in our room as well as above the bath.  When we arrived after dinner, there was a bottle of champagne, chocolates and a note from the hotel to wish my husband happy birthday again. It was a…"

June 2022,"At the Shard, Shangrila","It’s a great experience in Shard Shangrila. The amazing view and great food coupled with best service of Nathaniel and Vincent would complete the first time experience of a traveler. I am in a vacation and the “shard experience” is one of the talks of the town. I am privileged to meet Nathaniel, my “kababayan” (town mate) who is from Mulanay, Quezon province in the Philippines and the wine expert of the Shard.  He and the other crew gave us a once in life time experience of the place where we saw the whole city of London. The tea which varied according to the taste of the client would be personally prepared. The “classy food” fits to the fantastic view. The services brought us to a “homey” experience despite the number of people around. Thanks to the Shard Shangrila for the…"
June 2022,Welcoming & Friendly staff,"This is a posh restaurant but you don’t feel intimidated because of the staff , from the doorman ,receptionist Maria ,Elvis our waiter & Nathaniel the Sommelier are very welcoming and friendly & will offer to take your photos & video. Afternoon tea in London are around the same price of the Ting.The only difference is that you get the good view of the Tower Bridge ,Tower of London & friendly staff. And Elvis has a way of  selling the Champagne drinks instead of just having a normal Tea in a not imposing manner.So we got the Pink. Champagnes & also a Tea.Very good sales talk.I also like the guy who make a trick to do smoke drinks , good for Instagram.I also like the Live Music. However, I rather have a bone china tea pot a  more traditional & we went on the Jubilee Celebration I…"

A combination of your classics - toast, sausages, beans and for continental like pancakes. As well as cold foods like salmon. Basically anything you wanted, they would magic up.  I asked for a well done fried egg and I didn't have to wait for it, they bought it to me.  Which was lovely. But the best thing was the Chinese additions with gyozas etc.  I love gyozas so having that with a full English was music to my ears.  Jenny my server was attentive but not annoying, you know the difference. She knew when I wanted another plate,  she knew when to leave me to enjoy the scenery. It was a lovely experience.  A great experience and started my birthday on a wonderful note!"
June 2022,Views stunning. Watch out for hidden charges,"This was our 10 year wedding anniversary we added 5 course meal at ting and bottle of champagne to the package/booking.  The bill should have been £1116 but we ended up paying £1339.72 and despite querying this with a duty manager still find myself emailing back and forth with ting manager now to establish exactly why. So I advise watch out for hidden discretionary service charges on rooms, and in restaurant.  Check what you order as in a bottle of wine is the price you actually get charged as you won’t find out until later on check out. Check out staff don’t know either. Even the duty manager I complained to later didn’t know. Plus the wine list charges on the menu are more than are showing on the website. Can’t fault the views and the sheer luxury of staying in this peaceful…"
June 2022,Fantastic!  Unmissable,"Fabulous! Delicious!  Great food, ambiance, service and drinks!  Anyone who is in this side of town should come and enjoy.  Wagyu was simply divine.  And the view is amazing.  Enjoyment for many senses.  Dont hesitate - it  a hotel restaurant, you need to up the elevator, but you wont regret it!"
June 2022,Kiro was such a gracious host,"Kiro made us feel welcome from the moment we stepped in the restaurant. Attentive and kind, he made the whole experience that much more enjoyable. The food was delicious and very easy to share and try multiple dishes."
June 2022,"The Fabulous Mr Fabio Noni!! Gio Gio, Tanveer & Simona",My partner and I visited the Sky Lounge during our joint birthday weekend celebrations. Fabio and the team ensured that we had a fabulous time with a fabulous view and I would like to take the opportunity to truly thank them for what they did for my partner and I. Thank you all.
June 2022,Splendid Shard,"Certainly one of the best hotels in london, and the view is a literal standout of the best lot  Check-in was good and when i enquired about upgrade, the answer was unhelpful - “you’ve already got the best suite”. Which is obviously not true  The staff from porters, conceirge, restaurant etc. are all very good  The suite is very nice with expectedly amazing views  The pool is indoor , small and not for laps. Gym also small with the great views  Location wise, seems 30 mins from everywhere so the taxi bills piled up. And 45 min from Harrods  Almost perfect 7 day stay then something odd happened on the last evening. We found the cleaning staff slumped on our bathroom floor. She managed to get up and at our door , collapsed again. Our room was in some disarray. We called the front…"

May 2022,Amazing experience. Most definitely 5*,Perfection as ever! Wonderful experience. Staff exemplary. Views unbelievable. Yes pay more but worth it for incredibly high standard of service and location. Huge choice of everything. Even the toilets were 10/10. Seeing is believing!
September 2021,Booked for a special night out.,"Not sure why it has taken me so long to write this review!!  I wanted to stay somewhere special for my 50th birthday last year after all the hell of the previous year or so, and the Shang ri la did not disappoint.  The room and view was amazing, and the staff could not have done more to help or make me feel special, including a lovely little delivery of a birthday cake.    Three of us shared a room as a base for our night out, and I opted to sleep on what can only be described as the most comfortable z bed I’ve ever slept in.  Going to sleep to that view is incredible and quite possibly one of the best nights of sleep I’ve had.  Whilst pricey, if you have the money and want to do something special, go for it."
May 2022,Afternoon tea,Carlo was amazing.......I will deff come back.....he looked after us so well....thank you Carlo. We had an amazing time :)... .......................................................................  ...

May 2022,"Loved the service, libations and of course the view at the Sky Lounge, Shangri-La","Booking ahead a couple of days allowed us to get a lovely table for 4 in the Sky Lounge on the 34th floor. We were next to the window (not guaranteed) overlooking the Thames (Tower Bridge, Tower of London, HMS Belfast..and a LOT more!).   We enjoyed several of their main courses - loved the sweet and sour prawns, but all dishes had fans at our table. Our waiter - Fabio - was excellent. Attentive, prompt and a great demeanour. The drinks we ordered - 3 cocktails (thankyou Noni!) were wonderful as was the Veuve Cliquot...a personal favourite. Another round please!  Will be back, probably quite soon :).   PS: you will have 20 GBP added to your bill for each person given the vista, which is well worth it, and better to be aware than surprised. 90 minutes for our table was more than…"
April 2022,Afternoon tea,"Wonderful time, great views, enjoyable afternoon tea and Danny our waiter was excellent. Would be nice if you could take away any uneaten food, like in other afternoon tea venues. Would go again for a special occasion."

Made the experience all the more special!"

May 2022,"Lovely as ever, but one hidden surprise...","Stayed once again at the Shangri-La, (2nd time in 12 months) this time we stayed in a Premier City view King room (4511) for 2 nights - As ever, lovely views, comfy bed, and wonderful bathroom (albeit our TV in the bathroom seemed to only have 6 channels working - First world problems.) The room is slightly more noisy than our previous room, we could hear the trains, I could also hear the neighbouring rooms shower - but note, I am a very light sleeper, my partner, wasn't disturbed. All staff were courteous, helpful and smiley, as they always have been. Food and drink in both Gongs and Tings were delicious. I can highly recommend the Mongolian Beef.  1 thing to note, when we booked and paid in full we were charged a service charge of roughly £68, upon check out we were charged…"
May 2022,Unforgettable afternoon tea at Ting,"The afternoon tea at the Ting restaurant is an unmissable, unforgettable, unique experience. I've been to London many times, have had good meals but the Ting is really something I had never seen or tasted. The food is remarkable, perfectly made, with strong flavours, each piece of the menu is meticulously harmonised, a big well done to the kitchen staff. Not just the food is delicious, the views, breathtaking, but the waiting staff is really the cherry on top. We were served by Esmail and Nathaniel who were so kind, so careful, attentive and courteous. I can't wait to go back!"
May 2022,Ting Restaurant,"Anyone visiting London wanting an experience to remember need to visit Ting Restaurant at The Shard.

The cocktails were out of this world, compliments to the bartender."

May 2022,"Nice view, but that's it.","Beautiful view, but we paid 1000 pounds for my wife's 40th birthday, and showed up with no welcome other than a lady on reception who basically told us ever bar/restaraunt was completely booked up and we couldn't go have a celebratory drink of champaign for my wife's 40th.  We ended up having to eat at another restaraunt off the premises on the other side of the shard.  The rooms, although only a few years old, are beat up and weathered.  Carpet felt dirty and a lot of bangs and knicks all over the faux wooden walls, etc.  Was very shocked at the room size of the 'king bed with city view' don't be fooled by the photos, the rooms are very small, and there are only 2 decent sized windows with a massive pole obstructing one of the views. The service at the pool (which closes at 7…"
May 2022,Wonderful view and service,"Marlon was great all night, he got us a table by the window to celebrate our engagement. The food was brilliant and the desserts were very pretty. Thank you to the lovely wait or for making our night special"
May 2022,Consistent and purposeful service from the heart from Jing!,"Lovely and memorable experience. The staff and Jing went the extra mile and it was exceptional. However, we noticed that there was noisy vacuuming of the next door table. Maybe that area can be fine tune. Otherwise well done! The food was tasty but could go up a notch higher we felt."

May 2022,Amazing experience,"Me and my family went to suprise my little sister for her 18th birthday and the service was just excellent 10/10.

I will definitely be returning"
May 2022,Thank you for Madalina at the Shard ShangriLa London,I found Madalina to be extremely helpful and supportive. She was friendly and most caring. My partner and I are in our 60’s and Madalina made our visit very memorable. Thank you Madalina. She was kind and very considerate.
May 2022,Best afternoon tea we have had!,"The afternoon tea experience was amazing from start to finish! Vincent and Jing were extremely attentive and nothing was too much trouble. We would definitely recommend that you visit Ting for afternoon tea if you are visiting London, you will not regret it! Nothing was too much trouble and the atmosphere and music was great! We were in London for a few days for the Buckingham Palace garden party and having the Jubilee themed afternoon tea kept the royal theme for our trip! We will definitely be back when we visit London!"
May 2022,Afternoon Tea - top notch Service,"Had a special occasion and booked a table for Three course lunch, but traded up to Afternoon Tea as looked more special. Don't regret that decision.  Staff at Ting were very attentive and made suggestions on drinks and described the food well. Elvis was looking after us very well and tried a number of drinks and tea on his suggestions.  Overall a great visit....lovely food and great service"
May 2022,Afternoon tea,Service was great. King was our hostess and she was very attentive. The food was delicious and enough as we left full up . The view was amazing and it was a fantastic treat for my husbands 60th birthday . Would come back again for an amazing experience.

January 2022,The best one,"We are no strangers to Shangri-La The Shard, we feel it’s our 2nd home here in London. We had quite a few memorable stays at the hotel, the recent one was to celebrate my son’s birthday party, we hired the large Ball Room of Ren, from the special requested deco to the 5 star staff services, every details were spot on, it was an unforgettable experience. Here I want to specially mention Senior Sales Manager Lulu, who has been so supportive and what a delight to work with her since we first stayed at Shangri-La London back in 2018, Lulu has been always there for us. We will be back for more stays at Shangri-La London. 非常值得再去的酒店，设施服务都是一流的。给我的家庭留下了非常好的回忆。特别是lulu, 总是能让每一次的入住像家一般的温暖。"
May 2022,Best afternoon view and the best swimming pool view.,Jenny our server was very kind and gave us outstanding service. The food was delicious Thanks Jenny. The pool and spa view is breathtaking.  The best bday celebration ever. I will definitely come back again.
April 2022,Very Poor Value - Much Better 5* Hotels in London,"Recently stayed at their London/Shard property. Very poor value for money - high prices are okay for high quality and service. Unfortunately service fell significantly short of expectations - some examples I encountered: reception staff were untrained on both check in and check out, check in at 4pm/checkout at 11am, very poor service in Ting restaurant and told we were unable to get a drink after 11pm. I would avoid this property as there are much better 5 star hotels in London at a similar price point."
May 2022,The Shard amazing food and views,"We had a great time here at the gong bar, the staff were very friendly. Mira especially was great, she was the one mainly serving us and she was lovely and we had a nice little chat.  Would highly recommend coming here for some great drinks and wonderful Sushi."
May 2022,Amazing service from Danny and Marlon,Amazing service from Danny and Marlon.  We had a lovely view of London . Shangri la knows how to do the service though I must say it was good but not great selection of food … some food was amazing and other options were less so ( agreed by all 3 of us ). But service was genuinely amazing - hence 5/5
April 2022,Fab,"Brilliant just brilliant. Lovely place, lovely people and brilliant atmosphere. We were really impressed and well looked after. We will definitely be coming back soon to take advantage of this fab place. For anyone who hasn’t tried, they should."
October 2021,Afternoon Tea @ The Shard (TING),"I recently experienced Afternoon Tea in the sky at Ting Restaurant at The Shard! Our hosts (Marco and Jenny) were incredible and so kind. Marco even showed us some tricks he had been working on when serving our tea - he definitely went above and beyond to keep us well looked after and entertained. I also appreciate the Marco and Jenny took photos of me and my friends which are such a special memory!  The menu offered a halal Afternoon Tea option too which was very inclusive and lovely!   Overall, I would highly recommend this Afternoon Tea to anyone visiting London! Definitely a unique experience!"
September 2021,Stunning views and beautiful pictures.,"Beautiful hotel with absolutely stunning views, gorgeous room and amazing experience. Loved the warm toilet seats and the amazing bathroom. Drawbacks - the bar, although stunning was not particularly comfortable, one seat and one stool, not conducive to relaxing. Quite corporate, an Instagram hotel, as my husband says, great for photos but lacks warmth and sincerity from staff. Still I would recommend it - once in a lifetime experience!"
April 2022,Mr Clark,"We had a wonderful views over London with amazing weather. Momo who looked after us was brilliant, so friendly and accommodating, he really made our experience. We’d love to come again and hope to have Momo serving us  👍"
April 2022,Great as always,"Wonderful view, incredible drinks, great service!! Took my daughter here for our joint 50th / 20th birthday. Nice atmosphere and really friendly and professional staff. A great range of a exotic cocktails and they will make the classics if you ask."
April 2022,An amazing experience!,"Wow! What can I say? One of the most incredible experiences I’ve had. Great customer service from start to finish.  We stayed in a premier room with a city view on the 37th floor and it didn’t disappoint. The views were absolutely amazing, the bed was so comfy that we didn’t want to get out of it the following day!   As for the bathroom! A window side bath looking at the London eye as you soak up that city view. A rainforest shower & a built in TV in the mirror! Lots of little shampoos and soaps too!  Plenty of facilities, a well stocked mini bar with free tea and coffee supplies.  Overall this was an amazing experience, I look forwards to visiting again in the near future.  The kindest of regards to all staff."
April 2022,10/10 service,"Madalina went above and beyond with the customer service for me and my friend, she was the first person to greet me and when I asked to change seat she happily helped me. She made me feel like a superstar and I’ll be back."
April 2022,Mr byron,I was soo amazed by the services that I got from Madalina 10/10 will be coming back she was so professional and made us laugh and showed us around . And good recommendations on the drinks will be telling friends
April 2022,Excellent Everything,"I just finished a lovely visit to ting for afternoon Tea. I was served by Helga who was so friendly, helpful, and informative!  Her tea recommendations were excellent!  I was a little anxious because this was my first time having afternoon tea, but she made the experience easy, informative, and just lovely over all lovely.  Her tea recommendations were spot on. The savory and sweet dishes were also excellent.  I particularly enjoyed the scones with the cream.  Together with the strawberry jam provides a delightfully sophisticated taste! Last but not least, the view of London is the best in the city! I mean often times the view is what you go for but, what was awesome was the awesome service! I recommend that if you can come, you totally should.  It does get busy about 12:30…"
April 2022,Refreshing cocktails on Easter Sunday,Loved the ambiance as well the great service. Can’t wait to go back! This guy recommended to us cocktails that match with our flavours but as well a pizza with truffle oil that was major. If you are in the area is a must to try!
April 2022,Wonderful evening,"We had a wonderful visit to Ting restaurant at Shangri-la. The food was amazing, the view from our table spectacular looking over Tower Bridge and towards Canary Wharf, and our waiter, Leon, was fantastic. He was so knowledgeable about each dish and spoke in just the right detail about which ingredients were included in each dish to enhance flavour and taste even further.  It was a lovely experience having a host take the time to talk us through our food choices and how best to enjoy them.  Leon really was exceptional and looked after us so well.  As it was Easter weekend we had the Easter roast set menu. My wife chose corn fed chicken as her main and I had salmon Wellington. Both were delicious.   Highly recommend a visit to Ting and also a stay in the hotel."
April 2022,Miss,"Best sever ever!! Very friendly and exceptional waiting skills, we’ll be back again very soon.  Momo was very friendly and the best waiter I’ve had! The shard is beautiful for its views and service, the best in London"

April 2022,Momo the great,"Amazing view from the 52nd floor, brilliant service, especially from Momo. The cocktails are top class, main top would be the Fudge Tariq, which is an incredible sweet treat. Bring your swimmys and sneak into the pool for extra fun."
April 2022,Room with a view,"We entered the Shangri La and the gentleman at the front were really welcoming and friendly. When we walked inside the staff waiting in the foyer were less so.  Checking in was easy although the person checking us in wasn’t overly friendly.  However did help us change our pool time slot.  We got to our room and the blinds were down when we opened them the view was AMAZING. Few issues found in the room.  The beds were not made up as twins beds, wet patches on the carpet and stains in the bathroom. We left feedback using the in room app. The general manager called to rectify these problems and gave us complimentary drinks to our room. Lovely touch. Although the stains in the bathroom and wet carpet were not resolved they did offer us a room change. However, the room wasn’t like…"
April 2022,Momo is the best!,"Had a great time at the GONG. Windows seating, fabulous drinks, and the best waiter: Momo 💖  Nothing else to say really. Great time, great friends and stunning views. Can’t ask for anything more really."

April 2022,Wonderful stay in the clouds,"We had a perfect getaway at the Shangri-La The Shard. The location is perfect for flying in to London City Airport, so easy to get there and so much easier than the always crowded Heathrow Airport. The area is quite nice, many small local restaurants and a quick walk along the Thames over the Millenium Bridge and you stand right in front of St. Pauls Cathedral.  The room with city view does not disappoint, we loved all of it and the sunrise is memorable as well as taken a bath with that view especially in the evening.  A sumptuous breakfast buffet, you won't miss anything. Ting Restaurant, Gong Bar, the pool all worth visiting. We will return for sure."

Thank you Shangri-La London for looking after us."
April 2022,Amazing birthday weekend,"This hotel was perfect from start to finish. From the moment we checked in to the moment we left all members of staff couldn’t have been more polite and professional. The hotel was very clean and obviously to a very high standard. Up on check in the young lad who checked myself and my girlfriend in noticed when he checked my ID it was my birthday, after being in a room a short a while a small birthday cake was sent up along with a card, what a nice thing to do!  The room was incredible, literally perfect! Very clean and well kept we were very impressed.  We also had breakfast in the hotel, all the staff in the restaurant were very polite and helpful and couldn’t have done more us.  Overall an amazing hotel and the perfect choice for my birthday weekend! Literally couldn’t have…"
April 2022,OMG!,"This was our first visit to the Sky Lounge, simply put, we are amazed. Not only is it a stunning vista, but the service, food and facilities are second to none (we seriously suggest you go to the toilet!).  Thank you, Fabio, Noni & Morales!  Barbara & Josh."
April 2022,Worth every penny,"Absolutely fabulous stay from start to finish. The service here is impeccable from the moment you are greeted. Lovely complimentary prosecco on arrival, bags taken to the room promptly, greeted by staff who pass you in the corridor.   We went for the king size city view room on the 49th floor. The views are to die for. Well worth spending the extra money for the view. Spotlessly clean. Extra large bed. Nice touches like binoculars and a map of the city.  Breakfast was beautiful. Everything you could want and more (including even some asian cuisine like bao buns).  Only criticism: 1)  slightly disappointed by a few wear and tear marks in the hotel room and 2) it took 20 mins to check in, even though we arrived at 4pm (when check in should be guaranteed). But I gave this feedback…"

April 2022,Good experience but..........,".........very significantly overpriced in my view. Been planning to try a night here for a while. Whilst everything is beautifully designed, the staff and service very good, the rooms nice and the views spectacular there is much, much better value to be had in London. I won't detail the good stuff as it's quite obvious, but a couple of niggles. Firstly the spa is small, and was quite noisy with children despite me deliberately booking a slot after the 'children's hours'. Secondly, literally everything has to be booked in advance - when paying upwards of £600 (room-only) in any establishment it's not unreasonable to expect to have access to most if not all facilities when you want. As a result you can't do anything spontaneous. Glad we tried it and enjoyed the experience, but…"
April 2022,A amazing place,"Had a fabulous time at the Shard today for my daughters birthday. We started at the Viewing Gallery with its fantastic views, had a cocktail from the bar and a laugh with one of the bar staff ( sorry didn’t get your name,  the guy who is studying photography and had a good knowledge of the Samsung S22 pen).  Then we went down to the Gong bar where we had a fantastic time.  The food was lovely, we had the meat bento box, chicken Satay skewers and the truffle fries it was delicious.  The atmosphere was great and the staff were very friendly.  A big shout out to Mo Mo our waiter who made us feel very welcome and went above and beyond to Make our visit special.  We timed our visit to the restaurant  so that we saw London in the daylight then halfway through our visit the sun went…"

I requested a corner 'bath with a view' and it was delivered - if you like a bath request this! We had a beautiful swim and sauna in the infinity pool and spa. Breathtaking window table in the Gong bar for champagne and cocktails - followed by a delicious meal in Ting restaurant afterwards,  The sommelier Irene in particular was extremely helpful.

We arrived very early and not expecting to be checking in we simply asked if we could leave our bags here with the concierge and come back when our room was ready. Sadly our room was not ready, but instead they upgraded our room and checked us in straight away.   The gentleman (Josh) on reception could not do any more to help. Making sure this was a special stay just seemed par for the course. We left our bags with the concierge and made our way to the room. WOW!  What a room and the views. Be ready to be wowed.

The bar, while nice, was perhaps a little expensive and we didn’t get a window seat, which was a bit of a shame (though really not the end of the world). That being said, doesn’t detract from a great visit -  would highly recommend and likely will be back!"
February 2022,Wonderful experience,"It was a wonderful experience, made even better by the service of Momo, who provided advice and friendly conversation. An enjoyable afternoon,  venue, views and service. Wonderful cocktails and a knowledgeable server in Momo.  Thank you.  "
February 2022,Thanks Alex for an amazing first time experience!,"Had an amazing time at the Ting Restaurant, lovely few and relaxing atmosphere, it was an amazing afternoon for my friend and I, we had lunch and a few cocktails which were delicious, our waiter Alex provided exceptional customer service even recommended drinks and meals from the menu and made us felt so comfortable, great first time experience will definitely dine here again."
February 2022,Professional service with great ambience,"Professionally served by Momo with great music, view looking over Thames and ambience. Great choice of cocktail, liquor and light food. There is also English afternoon tea which we will definitely try next time."
February 2022,Great experience!,Momo was amazing! He was funny and showed care and professionalism to his role. Very sharp service from all the team and Momo personalised the experience and provided emphasis on the top quality service delivered. Had a great time and would highly recommend.
February 2022,Excellent service and great value,"Jing took excellent care of us - she really struck a balance between ensuring we were comfortable and giving us space to enjoy ourselves. As always they encourage you to try as many teas as possible and as much food as you want (something you don’t always see in London).  Also there was a live band (duo) who were excellent, without disrupting the conversations or ambience. All-in-all, a great day!"
February 2022,Gong bar ,Beautiful evening in gong bar with excellent service from Momo. Stunning views and excellent food/drinks   Delicious shot to end the evening was very much welcomed and couldn’t have asked for more in terms of the experience. 
February 2022,Just incredible!,"As a bit of an architectural geek, I have always loved the Shard and it was an absolute dream staying here. Every member of team we spoke to were amazing and couldn't do enough for us. Everyone clearly had a lot of pride for where they work which is very rare!  We had a City view room and were just in awe of everything the hotel had to offer and the views over London are incredible.  We had breakfast in our room after a swim in the breathtaking infinity pool and couldn't believe the quality. An amazing way to start the day!   The only bad bit about our experience was how quickly our stay went but we are already planning our next visit for September and cannot wait!   Thank you to all the team for a lovely stay!"
February 2022,Relaxing in the sky.,The service was brilliant and welcoming. The room was comfortable and all aspects thought of including binoculars and landmark map   The room service food was the best I have ever tasted. The pool was brilliant and enjoyed an early morning swim watching the sun rise.  Recommend if you are thinking about it just do it
February 2022,Birthday dinner,"Absolutely wonderful service! Our waiter for the evening (Vincent) was attentive, provided recommendations and ensured the added touch of birthday petit fours sealed a lovely evening for my sister.  Food was timely and delicious.

February 2022,WOW,"From the moment we stepped out of the car we were treated like Royalty and with the upmost respect by every single member of staff who couldn't do enough for us.   At check in we were greeted by Tyrone who gave us the warmest of welcomes and all the information we needed.    The hotel is spectacular and our room (The Iconic) had us speechless from the moment we opened the door.  The views across London and Tower bridge were absolutely breathtaking and felt almost touchable.  All the luxurious touches in the room, the Shangri-La bed and the bath with a view to name a few were extremely special to us.   The experience of the Skypool and sauna with a coffee was the perfect opportunity to unwind and made us feel so relaxed, and the staff at the Skypool and sauna waiting to hand you…"
November 2021,The views!,The Shangri-La was magical from the moment we stepped through the door. The warm welcome by Arnold on the ground floor and all the way to level 35 where Tyrone at reception welcomed us with open arms. Berta checking us in with a big smile and Ellen and Stefania showing us the hotel with such pride. The room was more than you can expect with views over all of London. All guests have to visit the pool. It’s a one of a kind experience!!! And the lady working at the pool makes you feel like a VIP guest!  We spent the evening in TING. Being welcomed by Rosita and given a beautiful table. The lovely Ketiola looking after us and Kat giving us the best wine recommendation (We still dream about the dessert wines). Spiros made the whole evening with his special attention to us as guests…

Brilliant evening for our delayed 40 th wedding anniversary . Watching from sunshine to dark the change in London . Momo was brilliant ."
January 2022,"Great views, good cocktails and service","People come for the views. At 52 levels up it’s quite special and the ambience is pleasant and quiet not like aqua and Oblix below.

Thank you to MoMo who took good care of us through the evening!"

January 2022,Utter perfection!,My stay here was utter perfection! Just a short stroll from London Bridge tube station this is a sanctuary for all the senses in the clouds. Every member of staff I had the pleasure of meeting was genuinely helpful and exceptionally knowledgeable and polite.  Drinks at Gong are a must! This is a vibrant and bustling bar with sweeping views of the city and dinner at Tien was exceptional. The range of wines available are extensive and the sommelier was well-informed and every one of his choices superbly complemented each dish. The service throughout the hotel was exemplary and faultless. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. It truly is utter perfection!
January 2022,Treasured memories,"Booked a 2 night stay for a family celebration. There was a problem with the booking - a “system error” had let me book a room at a too low price . My booking was then cancelled . After calling to complain I did receive a call back. I compromised on the room but we were given complimentary breakfasts .  When we arrived everything was perfect : the room was beautiful - including the written message on the window !!!!  All the staff were friendly , attentive and very professional - loved being handed a towel when getting out the pool, the night turn down service was very much appreciated, midnight requests to the concierge for drink bookings, beautiful breakfast seating and welcome champagne. All 5 of our food/ drink bookings had window tables, this was  amazing - I could sit all…"
January 2022,"Fabulous views (except the view of other people’s bathrooms) but food, drink and service don’t live up to expectations","The one thing that makes this hotel fabulous is the views. The angles of vision of the London skyline are unrivalled and stunning- but aside from that, it’s decidedly mediocre.  There’s nothing that’s truly terribly, but rather lots of things that aren’t ‘right’ for a 5 star hotel, and these really do ruin the overall experience.  The reception area is quite chaotic as it has guests checking into the hotel plus non-residents going to the Sky Lounge or Ting restaurant. Not to mention lots of quite bizarre green mannequins wearing only salopettes!   Someone was pouring small ‘Welcome’ peach Bellinis but during the time we were there checking in (and weren’t actually offered one) the table had more empty, dirty glasses than full ones to take.  Check in took 20 minutes - not…"
January 2022,The best over night stay,I took my girlfriend for her birthday and we both had an outstanding time. The staff both at the Shangri-La reception and Ting were excellent and very helpful and polite. They really made an effort to make sure everything was spot on for her birthday.   The city view room was out of this world and the views were stunning. I can’t wait to come back again. Thank you guys and I appreciate everything you did for us.   AJ
January 2022,Amazing!,Came to the Ting restaurant for cocktails for my daughter’s birthday. Amazing views of the river and lovely comfortable seats in restaurant. Could have stayed all evening!   Staff were really attentive and a big shout out to Michael who made our visit so special. Will be back!

January 2022,Fantastic evening!!,"We often come to the Gong bar and it is always a unique experience !! thanks to Momo and his service which was outstanding!

January 2022,Great experience with a view,Our server Momo made the visit unforgettable! Great recommendations on the food and cocktails! Definitely a place that you must visit during your stay in London! If you plan to enjoy the sunset it is better to book the table in Gong some time after the sunset so you could enjoy the sunset view from 32 floor
January 2022,"Stay at The Shangri-La The Shard, London","Stayed at thehotel weekend of 15th January 2022. From the very start we were welcomed so warmly. Service and attention to detail was amazing.

January 2021,One of the nicest hotels I've ever seen!,"I stayed at the Shangri-La at The Shard with my fiancé as I wanted a super nice hotel stay because I was going to propose to her at ""The View From The Shard"" later that night.  Staying here was ABSOLUTELY the right choice and even though it was very expensive, I would do it again in a hear beat!  The room and the view were unbelievable and the staff (during the stay AND before) were so helpful and accommodating and wonderful!  I had tons of questions about booking dining reservations, tea, etc, and everyone was always so willing to help.  My fiancé forgot her hair dryer and the concierge said they would send someone to the store to get one for her if we needed!  I was on the fence about paying the high price to stay here but one of my good friends had been before and said DO IT,…"
December 2021,Perfect experience,"Most amazing experience, can only recommend. Very good wine and food advice. We checked into the Hotel and chose to have dinner at Ting, we will definitely be back for more good wine and food here. Ask for Carlos and Nathaniel for good advice."
December 2021,Date night,"We booked Gong bar while on a weekend break in London. Our first visit to the Shard did not disappoint, giving breath taking views of the city skyline from a perspective you cannot get anywhere else in London. Special mention to Dhillon at Gong who looked after us superbly and went out of his way to show us around the bars sky pool and other amazing facilities. He is a credit to Shangri-La. We will be back as soon as we can."
December 2021,Special Xmas visit,"Booked Ting Restaurant for our stay in London for a couple of days from Cornwall and it was the Best, made in no small effort by our great attendant Gianni. Thank you Gianni, won't forget you and hope you have a great time with your Grandad in Greece.."
December 2021,Singapore U.K. Association Christmas celebration,"SUKA Christmas lunch  Shangrila at the Shard Ren room  SUKA (Singapore UK Association) members and friends  celebrated our much anticipated post lockdown pre-Christmas at the Ren room Shangrila recently. Dressed to the hilt to blend with the posh, plush ambiance, as global foodies, we expected the best at the table. The GM, Kurt Macher and his well trained team were there to greet us. Table settings tastefully arranged , complete with classy Christmas crackers.  The Christmas buffet was meticulously selected to match the magnificent panoramic views as the backdrop to our gathering.

The staff was very courteous and helpful from the doorman to the cloakroom and service staff.  What was very good to note was that all diners had to show proof of negative results of lateral flow tests.  In spite of his busy schedule, the General Manager, Mr. Kurt Macher, took time to address our party.  The table decorations were beautiful, with scrumptious food, desserts, and drinks served by friendly staff.  All in all, a beautiful lunch and an experience shared by a party of over 80.  The lift was…"
December 2021,Fab Evening Superb Food,Superb food served by equally superb staff. I’m sorry I didn’t catch ladies name but her recommendations were great especially Crepe Suzette.

December 2021,A must visit place in London,"Amazing service, even grater view, but above all you have to ask for Dhillon, the waiter. He will make a special evening a one to remember! You can talk about great venues as much  as you like, but great service goes a long way. Me and my fiancée’s evening so enjoyable.   10/10"
December 2021,Did NOT meet the expectations !!!,"I booked an Iconic City View room as a surprise long weekend stay at Shangri-La, The Shard, London to celebrate our first year anniversary thinking that it would be as memorable as possible - but not all the boxes were ticked.  Let me first start with the positives:  1. Obviously the view from the room is beautiful, especially during the night. If for nothing, you can just stay in your room and watch the city beneath your feet. 2. The Skypool was warm and I really enjoyed the quiet time we had at midday. At some point we had the room just for ourselves. 3. The Sauna next to the pool needs to be experienced as well - it has beautiful London views.  Now for the negatives (the bits that almost hurt me not being done/provided).  1. No personalised message card in the room or written…"
December 2021,Lovely afternoon tea,Brilliant way to spend the afternoon. Delicious savouries and sweet options. Fantastic view of London from our window table.

Their recommended us about food and cocktails and everything was amazing! I want to thank you Luis, Momo and Marj + Mada, you’re awesome guys❤️👑"
December 2021,Wonderful 5 course menu,"From the moment you walk in you know this will be a treat. The venue and view are spectacular. We chose to go for a 5 course menu.  Emilio was extremely attentive and a wonderful waiter. Please ensure you get Nathaniel's advise on what wine to have, as they recommend a fabulous malbec which capped off a brilliant birthday treat. We were very lucky and got seated at a window so the view was amazing. Food was excellent with particular highlight of the Banana and Chocolate dessert."
November 2021,Afternoon Tea,"Jing was really helpful, cordial and clear explaining the dishes. Food and drinks were really tasty and beautiful. The view is amazing. Come early to get a nice table facing the Tower Bridge and enjoy the splendid view. I would definitely be back."
November 2021,It was a delight!,I booked Afternoon Tea for my parents and it was a delightful experience. The service offered by Julien was of an exceptionally high standard. The view was amazing and there was a Christmas theme throughout the hotel which made it that extra bit special for them. Highly recommend
December 2020,Worst Customer Service Known to Man,Absolutely disgraceful customer service. Made an error on a booking and was told there was nothing that could be done about it and that the booking was non refundable. Was told three times they would call me to discuss the situation and never had one call returned. Due to this I will never stay at this hotel when your spending £900 a night you would expect to be treated a little better. Clearly profit over loyalty is how this group role.
November 2021,Birthday,We had an amazing birthday night. Nathanial and Danny showed great hospitality and should be rewarded for their efforts. They have been very helpful from the start with great people skills! We will recommend Ting
November 2021,Amazing,The food was delicious and the service was amazing.  The desserts were a bonus- great end of our London trip.  The view was spectacular to say the least.  Definitely a must if you are visiting London… 😊 thank you

November 2021,The Shard afternoon tea,Very good and professional service . Polite and attentive service by Emilio. Great person to have helping us. Was considerate to what we wanted and didn’t rush us. Very clean resturant and the music was perfect
November 2021,Worth every star!,Really enjoyed our night her @ TING stunning views - lovely food & food and the service was great - a big Thanks to Giannis & Nathaniel! As I’m vegan I had the 5 course plant based  Tasting menu which had some unique and very tasty dishes! Definitely worth a visit!

December 2021,Mesmerising view and service throughout,"From start to finish every single member of staff we encountered went over and above to make our stay that much more amazing. Everything from check in to the sommelier. The room was beautifully prepared with champagne and a choice of exceptional desserts on arrival and the astonishing beauty of the room and the view speak for itself. Both our dinner and breakfast were extremely impressive with everything we could have wanted in a menu, and it was enjoyed with breathtaking views of London of course.  We woke up to the most magical sunrise over London because the rooms are designed so perfectly. The staff left us as speechless as the room and the view."
June 2021,Commendation,"This review is long overdue. We were supposed to stay at Shangri-la at the Shard June 2-3,2021 but my surgery coincided with the dates so I ended up cancelling it. Before that we have originally planned to stay at the Shard November 2020 but due to COVID-19, it was rescheduled. This post is for all of the wonderful staff who painstakingly answered all my queries and accommodated my requests. I greatly appreciate the excellent customer service and I’d definitely give it a 100%. I wish we’ll be able to book and stay at your wonderful hotel in 2022 and experience such world class service. You have such great staff which is a good reflection and standard of the hotel.  Thank you Kanwal Jeet, Carmen, Kimberley x"
November 2021,Memorable and magical,"The Shangri-La occupies a beautiful and dominant space within the Shard, London. The building is iconic and the hotel is exquisite. Walking through the doors is like stepping into a world of luxury and elegance. We were lucky enough to see the Christmas decor as our stay was end of November. The staff are warm and welcoming. It’s is not a cheap option. To be so luxurious is costly, so don’t not go here looking for a bargain- quite the contrary. Expect that you will spend alot of money, and be happy with the memories that this spend makes.  We spent 7 months organising a private party split into 3 elements throughout the weekend. The events manager handled all my requests with grace and knowledge. Lucia guided me hand in hand to ensure the events went smoothly and worry-free for…"
December 2021,Beautiful hotel and excellent service,Beautiful views from the hotel room and the spa located on the 52nd floor. Excellent service by the hotel staff who were incredibly polite and helpful and a special thank you to Kimberly from the front of house team who made our stay extra special.
December 2021,Great service by Jenny! Food outstanding.,Went for a festive afternoon tea. Jenny was our waitress and she was absolutely fantastic! Made the experience even better! Great food quality with a fully plant based afternoon tea option - as a vegan this was a great touch and was delicious. Views always a winner!
December 2021,Incredible service!,I cannot fault the service! Marjorie (apologies if misspelt) was absolutely incredible! She truly gave 10/10 service and cared for everyone in the room! Thank you Gong for having us! The food and drink were out of this world too :)

December 2021,Amazing service,"Evangelos served us, he was outstanding. So professional. He went above and beyond to make our experience memorable. Great service, lovely staff, great drinks. The views are incredible, great experience."
December 2021,Great view and excellent staff!,I went for a cocktail with my husband and the table was at the back. But thanks to Marj and Mira 5 minutes after our arrival we had a new table at the front so we could relax and enjoy the outstanding view from the Gong restaurant along with our great cocktails! Thank you guys! You made our night magical!
December 2021,Thoroughly recommendable,"We had our Christmas Dinner at TING with Giannis as our unobtrusively attentive waiter. The entire staff was very friendly and quick, waiting times were minimal and made pleasant by the wintry Alpine decor.   The food arrived quickly and fully met our expectations with the small dishes (appetizers) exceeding them (Tuna tartare, Roasted chestnut salad).   Try to get a window table (those are in the minority) as the view and the slanted floor-to-ceiling windows of the Shard add significantly to the overall experience. Don’t miss out on the bathrooms, either."
November 2021,MoMo was an excellent host,"MoMo made our visit one to remember! His knowledge and recommendations of cocktails were amazing! He made us feel completely relaxed on our big night out in the city! Would highly recommend a visit back, especially if MoMo is our waiter"

November 2021,Simply Spectacular,"Truly amazing stay for my father’s 70th Birthday celebrations with our extended family. The views and venues at this hotel speak for themselves, but it was the staff who totally made our experience extraordinary.

November 2021,Went above and beyond !!,"My partner and I came here for our anniversary and had the most EXCELLENT experience. We were served and tended to by Nathaniel and Marie who went above and beyond to accommodate us and make sure we had the best experience. It began with them moving us to a seat with a beautiful view at the beginning of the night, to serving us complimentary treats at the end of the night. The food was divine - we recommend the Malaysian fried chicken and the chocolate and banana tart. Overall a lovely experience and we will definitely be back."
November 2021,60th Birthday Cocktails at The Shard,"I was lucky enough to be treated to cocktails at the Shangri-La Restaurant on the 35th floor, and also at the Gong Bar on the 55th.

November 2021,Amazing Hotel. Its not just about the views ! ,The Shangri-la at The Shard is a beautiful hotel that sets new standards for modern understated luxury. Located high up in the Shard all rooms have great views both by day and night. Staff are really understanding of the customer needs and requirements in every area of operations at the hotel. The bedrooms are so light and bright and very well equipped. It's the kind of Hotel that gets you out of the shower and into the tub again ! Dining and bar  facilities exceeded expectations. All of this comes at a price of course and I suspect alot of accounts are settled with Corporate money. However it is also a Hotel that is  just wonderful for the individual traveller. Located in the City but West End attractions and restaurants are easily reached by taxi or public transport. 
October 2021,Fabulous hotel,"Have stayed a couple of times at the Shangri-La an it never fails to impress.  A beautiful hotel with magnificent views, lovely friendly, professional staff and a wonderful infinity pool on the 52nd floor.  Happy to recommend this hotel and I will be returning in to weeks time with a friend for a Christmas stay."

November 2021,Unforgettable experience! Can't wait to come back!,"Where do I even start?! From the moment we walked in it was nothing short of magical. We arrived to a stunning sunset with live music in the background and the most friendly yet professional welcome by the reception team. We were checked in by Kimberley, and greeted by the Duty Manager Johan. Both are a credit to the hotel. When we got to the room we were overwhelmed by the views (of course), but also by the many little touches that have been arranged as a surprise for our stay. In the evening we visited GONG for some fantastic cocktails and great atmosphere, followed by an unforgettable dinner in TING. The table, the team, the food and the wine,...everything was perfect!! In the morning we once again visited TING for breakfast and no wish was left unfulfilled! Finally, as we…"

November 2021,Dinner at Ting - amazing experience,"My husband and I dined at Ting for a special occasion and cannot fault any part of the experience.  Right off the bat, the setting and views from the restaurant set the tone for a special night.  Service from the outset was great - from the people immediately upon entering the building, to those you meet at the top of the lift, those greeting you at the restaurant, then the staff at the restaurant especially our waiter and the sommelier. I must give a huge thanks to ALEX our waiter for taking such good care of us.  He was always attentive without hovering, gave great advice on menu selections  (he was spot on with them all), arranged a special treat for my husband on his dessert.  The food itself was delicious and it was great to see meal options to suit a range of budgets…"

The views whether in your room, in the pool or at dinner are just breathtaking. The service was impeccable and the food in Ting was exquisite.

November 2021,Afternoon tea with a view,"Brought my mum for afternoon tea to celebrate her birthday. We were lucky enough to get the start of the Alpine tea (Ting’s festive offering) and it was really lovely (the Welcome Tea and the Apres Ski cocktail are worth their own mention!). We were looked after very well throughout by Jing - the service was impeccable from everyone but she was very friendly and nothing was too much.   The view is, of course, amazing and makes for a real experience."
October 2021,Not as Expected,"Firstly, when we checked in we was not informed that to use the lifts, you had to swipe you door card, very annoying, the view from the room, is of course amazing, the rooms are very nice, but a bit too business like, very disappointing for the price, one would expect a complimentary welcome drink in the room, not just a couple of refilled bottles of brita water, the mini bar had plenty of drinks in it but no mention that you would be charged at a very inflated coat, the cost of a small packet of Haribo's normal cost in the shop is around £1.00, they charged £4.00, I would have also expected more than just a small bottle of shampoo, conditioner, baby wash plus body lotion, in the bathroom, they did however have spare toothbrush's and toothpaste, our daughter had paid for a…"
November 2021,An outstanding dinner experience with excellent service and show-stopping view!,"Myself, my girlfriend and two friends dined at Ting before yesterday night 03.11 and saying that we were blown away by the whole experience is a huge understatement. We were welcomed by the kindest hostess and shown to our table right on the window for a jaw-dropping view.   Our waiter Emilio was extremely attentive and made sure we were happy from the moment we sat down to the moment we left. He anticipated all our needs, made us feel welcomed and accommodated all our requests, always with a smile and never made us wait.   I would also like to profusely thank the sommelier team who attended our table, Piotr and Masaki who made our wine tasting an experience on its own.   Throughout the whole meal, we felt welcomed and pampered by the most amazing staff. And a special thank goes…"

November 2021,"When you wish upon a star as dreamers do… you find yourself at the Shangri-La, London","Sometimes you’re looking forward to something that much and for such a long time, that the reality can hardly live up to your expectations. But absolutely everything at The Shangri-La at The Shard surpassed our wildest dreams.  The Shangri-La, Mr. Kurt Macher, the General Manager, and his team made this city break one to cherish for always and forever. The staff made sure our stay in the clouds turned into an experience we will never forget. Every day we were surprised by little attentions, delicious cakes and sometimes even gifts. The Shangri-La made dreams come true for us in West Europe’s tallest building.   Walking into a hotel room for the 1st time usually is somewhat exciting. Will the room be lovely… what about the view? Upon entering the room, the blinds opened to the…"

This is not a cheap meal out but the location, food and wine were all fantastic. Slight confusion over the bill, not quite sure why we still have points left and yet we had to tip up with a credit card. Thankfully we will be back before the end of the year probably for cocktails.   Esmail and Nathaniel were very attentive"

October 2021,"Outstanding Views, Great Room","There is nowhere quite like this to stay. Even though we were in the cheapest room option, it was spacious and we had four floor to ceiling windows with astounding views across South London. We spent nearly our whole stay just looking out of the windows and watching the sun set, night set in and then rise in the morning. The bed was huge and one of the most comfortable I've slept in. All the staff were helpful and welcoming. The options for evening meal and breakfast were very good too. We booked and went up to the pool but didn't get in, as it was tiny and not nearly as impressive as the photos on the hotel's site but this didn't matter, as it gave us more time to look out of our windows!"

Marta was the first person we made contact with when enquiring about holding our wedding at the venue. From then up until the wedding day she was an absolute joy to work with. Marta is very personable and professional, and she was always quick to respond to our many questions, whether it be over email or phone. We also got to meet her a few times during the lead up to the big day, which was extremely helpful as apart from assisting with planning the event, it helped us to get to know her and the venue better. We were really impressed by how organised and dedicated Marta was, it’s obvious that she is passionate about ensuring couples have everything run smoothly on the day (not an…"

October 2021,Sleeping in the clouds,"Where to start! An outstanding hotel with a 6 star service and a night to always be remembered. We decided to celebrate our wedding anniversary by spending a night at the Shard with our 5 year old daughter. Not only does the hotel offer breath taking views of London the attention to detail is outstanding. Everything was thought of to make our stay extra special, from an incredible room, a personal welcome note on the window and a sprinkle of thoughtful in room amenities and gifts for us all. Pre arrival the staff helpt anticipate our needs and suggested pre booking the pool and restaurant to ensure we would be able to enjoy it. I was a little nervous at first as I am not good with heights but that was quickly forgotten as soon as I got into the pool. I am still day dreaming of…"
October 2021,Afternoon Tea at The Shard- an IGR event,"From start to finish this experience was unparalleled.

October 2021,Room only,Paid a significant amount of money to be told that we can only access the swimming pool at 8am and there was no accès to the hôtel bar because all the tables are booked for the night. So what you get for a luxury hotel is a room only. All be it a room with a view. Nothing else.  A hôtel where they put their guests second. At this money you could stay anywhere else in London. I will next time
November 2020,The only way to see london!,"We had an iconic room which is basically a glass room that shows views over all of London, its not just a room it is magical .

July 2021,A beautiful relaxing couples stay!,"From start to finish our stay was just the most amazing, relaxing lovely time. We were met in the lift by a lady who happened to check us in, we had mentioned we were staying as an early anniversary treat and when we got the room they had already got a cake up there for us to celebrate! The rooms are very luxurious and roomy and the bed, well you could just stay in it forever it was sooo comfy. I love all the little perks like the tv in the bathroom mirror and the Nespresso machine but the real highlight of the room was the breakfast in the room with the views over London, just spectacular and that same view is just as good if not better at night with all the lights twinkling.  The restaurants are all of an incredibly high standard for breakfast afternoon tea and dinner. The…"

August 2021,"Our wedding at The Shangri-La, The Shard","If Tripadvisor offered 10 review stars, we would have selected 10.    Our wedding at The Shangri-La, The Shard surpassed any hopes and dreams we could imagine.  From the moment we engaged with them to start planning the day to the send off we had the morning after, everything was so personal, professional and expertly executed.    We had 56 guests to the Wedding, a further 50 to the evening reception and 35 of our guests stayed overnight and everything just worked like clockwork.  The service was impeccable, the quality of the food was outstanding, we requested some additional equipment such as a larger twinkly dance floor and they sourced these with no fuss.

We brought family and friends with us and, like us, they had a fantastic stay!  I cannot recommend this hotel enough."
October 2021,Hospitality from the heart,"Upon entering the lobby on ground floor, I was warmly greeted by Ieva, Piotr, Ellen, Vincent and Christof. Even being greeted by everyone alone made me feel like a VIP. As Ellen was on her way up as well she kindly escorted me to Ting where I was meeting my friends for dinner. Gloria took over in her graceful manner and was attentive to my needs. Marie from Ting introduced us to the menu and was patient in teaching us how to use the tablet. As my friends and I were all tired from a long week, Piotr the sommelier suggested a wonderful selection of wines which we all enjoyed thoroughly. Throughout our meal in Ting, Alan and Spiros both individually checked on all the guests as well as us but it didn't feel robotic at all. In fact, they and everyone else mentioned above…"
October 2021,Amazing anniversary celebration,"We celebrated our two years anniversary (and 11yrs relationship) at the place we got married. So nice to be back for this staycation. The team went all out and had the room beautifully decorated with rose petals, candles and messages from the hotel.  The hotel itself was all decorated in Pink to support fight against Breast cancer. I think the best part of the stay was being recognised by the staff (having been the first gay couple to get married there!) and acknowledged by others when visiting the different outlets.   Thank you Shangri-La London for looking after us."

The views are some of the best by night in London so make sure you get to sit up against the glass windows.

From the moment of stepping foot through the door was literally swept away not only by the decor itself and stunning views , which are by far exemplary , but the service which simply spot on with dining options impeccable, the team here has figured out what true cuisine means.   A must have from the menu is  duck plate , cooked to perfection, definitely can be shared and please ask the Chef to cut it for you, will make everything so much easier.   Every meal should end with traditional team in the clouds… I can not get enough of this unique presentation , I am always in awe watching it , while  the London Bridge  scenery…"

The atmosphere was even more enhanced by a wedding that was taking place quite near us , I sipped on pink tea poured out by the waiter and watched as dry ice took over the cups and the table as he poured .  It is Breast cancer month so the “pretty in pink” colour scheme added a wonderful Enhancement to the already charming space looking over London tower bridge  and more .  Delicious pink treats were…"

We had a truly amazing stay. We received the warmest of welcomes from the moment we arrived - from the door staff at street level right through to the staff at reception, the housekeeping team, the restaurant staff , all were exceptionally well trained and professional and more than that they seemed genuinely happy to be part of the team which made it all feel very special indeed.  Our room was amazing! Spotlessly clean with a wonderful handwritten message on the window to greet us as the automatic blinds opened up when we entered the room. Within minutes an immaculate waiter was at our door delivering champagne and…"
October 2021,"Great view, great room, great facilities & great food","It was always a wish to experience the Shard and to be able to do so as a guest for a night in the Shangri-La was a double blessing. From dinner in the Gong, to swimming in the infinity pool, to sleeping in the enormous bed, every aspect of my stay was wonderful. The meeting room we used was spacious and well provided with technology. The breakfast and lunch were excellent - the only complaint was that there was too much food! Overall, a stay which was memorable for all the right reasons."

August 2021,Birthday Treat,"Birthday treat! We had a stunning room overlooking to the London Bridge. Upon check in we upgraded to a room with a free standing bath with a view.  We had to book in advance for the swimming pool, and sadly there was a time limit of one hour. The sauna was also overlooking to London/ Thames.  We booked in advance to the Ping restaurant and had a lovely table with a view. As we are vegetarians we were quite disappointed with the menu options…the waitress also forgotten to offer us bread; however offered to the table next to us (she left the butter on the table and after the main took the butter away) :(  Breakfast were nice and the staff were very attentive."
September 2021,Best service,Leon at ting restaurant is such a delightful person. Helped us choose the best items on the menu and also Took care of us very well. Hope to come again. Enjoyed the food. The desert is to die for. Main course is brilliant Especially the wagyu.

September 2021,Best Anniversary at Ting,"Ting has stunning food as well as view!  Fantastic service from start to finish. We booked a table for our 5th anniversary, went with the 3 course set menu which is astoundingly delicious and an amazing deal. Ketiola served our food and checked in on us, explained our dishes and asked our opinions. She is super sweet and helpful. Nathaniel kept us topped up on drinks and was there in a heartbeat if we needed anything. We were surprised by Happy anniversary chocolates, which made our experience even more memorable.  Compliments to the chefs who produced food like I've never had before. Going to London? Go to Ting, you won't regret it."
September 2021,Great hotel with the best possible views of London,"Stayed here for two nights in early September. Great experience on arrival with efficient valet parking and concierge service. On check-in we were upgraded to a room on the 49th floor with spectacular views over the rive towards the Walkie-Talkie and HMS Belfast. The room was well appointed including a Nespresso, binoculars and a fabulous bathroom. I was celebrating my birthday and was surprised by a cake and card which was a lovely touch. Our package also included their 'bath experience' which was divine - honestly the best smelling bath I've ever had! The buffet breakfast was good with a great selection available. The bread options were initially disappointing but I was offered sourdough toast when I asked. In summary, this is a great hotel in a great location with views to…"

Particular mention to Rita who went above and beyond to make our stay spectacular! Thank you so much, we couldn’t have asked for more."
July 2021,Outstanding!,"Over two years ago we  stayed here purely for the experience of spending a memorable night at one of London's unique hotels. The Shangri-La Hotel is located in the iconic Shard, that super-tall skyscraper of some 95 floors which towers over London from the south bank of the Thames at London Bridge. The hotel occupies floors 35 to 52 of the Shard, with the main Reception on the 35th floor.  Our stay then  was, without a doubt, exceptional.  That’s why we chose the Shangri-La at the Shard again, to celebrate a milestone birthday, seeing that a trip abroad to somewhere fabulous was virtually out of the question due to the COVID situation.  We wanted a room with a city view and one that offered the ‘bath with a view’ arrangement.  We’d selected a room type on the hotel’s website,…"
September 2021,Great tea at the Shard 'Ting',"It was fantastic, the staff were amazing.  Excellent impeccable service.  The staff just couldn't do anything more to enhance the experience.  I will definitely be returning often as the tea was awesome, the scones scrumptious and the cakes were just downright delicious.  A special thanks to Leon, Nathaniel and a female waitress who were all brilliant.  Attentive and friendly and just making my day special.    Nathaniel, you asked me if there was anything you could do to improve the service?  My answer is: 'No there is nothing more that you could have done.""   Alot of other hospitality staff could learn a lot from ALL of you as EACH staff member goes above and beyond.  Keep up the good work, Shangri-La Team ! Service with a smile :)"

October 2021,Marco is an angel,"I came here as a wedding photographer. The bridal party made a few requests for drinks and food. Nothing was too much for Marco, he even hand delivered a latte and a coke to the bride's room after I said I could take it for him. He insisted.   He was such a friendly and professional man. You're definitely in safe hands with him."

September 2021,The best waiter! Momo deserves a raise.,We had never been to the restaurant before and therefore had no idea what to expect but I can safely say it exceeded our expectations! This was mostly due to the waiter Momo. When taking pictures Momo generously took us out to a seperate room where we had more space. He also made sure we were well attended to all evening. He was extremely efficient and very polite. The food was great and the overall vibe of the restaurant was amazing.
September 2021,Great experience thanks to Waiter,"Myself and my girlfriend visited GONG bar as a date night, the food options are smaller portions but the quality is very high. The overall experience of the night was made 100x better thanks to our waiter Momo. He went above and beyond in his service, helping to recommend drinks for us. Momo showed us the pool room and allowed my girlfriend to take some pictures in the area thanks to the beautiful decor and backdrop. Overall a great night, made even better thanks to Momo."
September 2021,Absolutely wonderful,"We stayed for one night for our 25th wedding anniversary.  Yes it is expensive, but frankly it was worth every penny.  We had an amazing room with the biggest bed I have ever slept in, a large sitting area with separate walk in closet and the most awesome of bathrooms - the bath had the best views ever!   The service was exemplary - thanks for the little anniversary cake - and everyone was trained brilliantly - in the way that only hotels in the far east seem to be able to achieve.  Clearly the staff have all undergone the rigorous training that Shangri - La have in place - the sort of service where each and every guest is made to feel like they are the most important guest that the particular member of staff as seen that day! We had drinks in the Gong bar which was well worth…"
September 2021,Lovely afternoon at Ting Restaurant,"I booked a 3 course meal at Ting Restaurant using a Virgin Experience voucher. From stepping into the foyer to leaving it was a lovely experience. Everyone was welcoming, but particularly our waiter Elvis who went out of his way to check on us and other diners. He was friendly but very polite, there when we wanted something but not intrusive. The food was good but it was the service that really made it special."

September 2021,That Sky Pool!,"Myself and my partner stayed here as a treat and had the best time. I cannot recommend making the most of the facilities during your stay! Also, be sure to order a cocktail at GONG, I ordered a margarita and it was the best one I’ve had in London!"

September 2021,"Brilliant Hotel , Views and Staff","Stayed here for 2 nights in September as part of my 50th birthday celebrations and they made it very special. The tone was set from a friendly welcome at check in and then when we went in the room we had a bottle of Champagne and birthday cake waiting for us which was a nice touch.   The views are absolutely amazing and we spent the first 30 minutes looking out the window point out all of London's amazing land marks.   Rooms are a good size , clean and well kept as you would expect and a nice turn down service at night.  You have to try the infinity pool and sauna which was up on the 51st floor ( i think ) as this only adds to the whole experience.   Breakfast had a good  buffet choice and service was quick and efficient , nothing outstanding but nice all the same.   Service in…"
September 2021,What a great place for a special get together,Hubby booked this lovely evening meal in Ting 32nd floor for our wedding Anniversary.  Before that we went to Gong on the 53rd floor for cocktails. The whole  experience was just great.  The staff expecially Leon and Nathaniel were very accommodating.  Explaining how to use the electronic menu pad . Just great. Explaining cocktails.  And mixing up starters choices on the  English and Asian menu.  The food was very good with nice size portions. The whole place was very clean and tables were a good distance from other diner tables.  The view was amazing. We even got a rainbow when it rained . We were booked in before it got dark . So we got the views both in day light and night time.   Will defiantly return. Thank you  to all the lovely staff in both Ting  and Gong.

September 2021,Classic racial profiling,I live in Central London and returned to this location for staycation. We have stayed here before as well Paris and Shanghai. After buying jewellery at Harrods we popped into our flat nearby to pick up more face masks . We arrived back at the hotel around 9pm and a security tried to block me ( not my husband) from approaching the lift.  He literally acted like I was coming to rob the place.He put his arm as a barrier and asked (only )me where I was going and do I have a room. We are in a suite btw. White people were greeted warmly( temp check) and proceeded to enter. My husband ( white) was not questioned ( just temp checked like all the other whites. They are trying to prevent black people from socialising at this establishment. I will seek advice from trading standards and…

Beatrice and her friends had a fantastic time (and so did the adults ) and they will most certainly remember the experience.

September 2021,London High Life,"You take a bit of a risk when you book a hotel to celebrate a special occasion. So I’m very happy to review the Shanghai-La London as excellent on every level. Literally.  From dropping off our bags earlier than check in to regrettably having to depart to go home every member of the hotel staff was courteous, helpful and interested in us and why we were staying there.  We upgraded to a Premier City View room before arrival and it was the best decision. The views from our room were utterly mesmerising and we couldn’t stop looking at the city day and night. Some London hotels you’re pleased to only sleep in but this hotel was one where you just can’t wait to get back to look out of those windows again.  This trip was everything we hoped for and so much more. Thank you to everyone…"

Emily checked us in and she's the absolute best. Super helpful and had great suggestions !"

August 2021,16th Birthday Celebration,"We first visited Shangri-La for the first time to celebrate fathers day in June. We were given good rooms and a bathroom with view. On the very first day we had lunch in one of the restaurants and found a hair in our food. The second day we went for swimming and a big piece of mould similar to the size of a golf ball was that was stuck in the tap of the drinking water dispenser ended up in my cup . We called the person in charge and showed him and he notified his manager who then apologised.  After filling in a survey sent to us after our stay, we received an email from senior management and was reassured that our next experience would be much better and we will be well looked after when we choose to return.   We chose to return to celebrate my son 16th birthday in August. We…"

But most of all, I would like to thank all the employees who interacted with us (Concierge, Reception, Guest Relations, Housekeeping, Restaurants), who delivered an excellent service and made an passionate effort to meet all our needs. Thank you from the heart, already dreaming of the next stay."
September 2021,21st Birthday to remember,We visited the shard as part of my 21st birthday celebrations. Ting was the most amazing restaurant with the service from Esmail & Nathaniel being impeccable & the food & view being lovely also. I  would most definitely recommend a visit especially if celebrating a special occasion.
September 2021,The ultimate Shangri-La Experience.,"When one thinks of Shangri-La The Shard, London, of course one instantly associates it with opulence and glamour, yet it is so much more than that as the staff ensure that it is exceptionally welcoming and has a wonderful homely feel to it.  Despite living in London, we wanted to book something to look forward to that equally didn't involve much of a journey so we thought we'd try this wonderful Hotel.  Eventually it has been a dream that came true. Of course, staying at Shangri-La The Shard, London was a natural choice for my parents’ London staycation.  Upon arrival our cases were whisked away by the charming doorman, and we were very quickly checked-in by a very knowledgeable and professional person called Tyrone. Our stunning room was located on the 40th floor and as you…"
August 2021,Great service and food,"We had a lovely lunch at Ting as part of our honeymoon celebrations. Jenny was very attentive, the view was great and the food fabulous!

September 2021,Amazing Experience,"I booked to have dinner at the Ting restaurant as a anniversary lunch. It was the right choice, the place is amazing, the food was amazing, the staff was amazing, our waiter was very friendly and explained to us how the menu was. At the end he gave us the Mango tea with the hot water and ice, that was very beautiful! I don't he remember our waiters name, but people like him that makes an experience like this to remember and never forget!"
September 2021,Fab views but …..,"Firstly the views are fantastic and I guess this is what you are really paying for.  Having seen this hotel on the tv I realise they had a far superior service!  The rooms are nice but not wow (with the exception of the toilets which we all loved)!Most disappointing was the breakfast, it was a mediocre buffet with a very limited choice and the service was slow.  It seemed to take forever to get a cup of coffee which was served in the tiniest of cups and no refill was offered.  The cocktails in Gong were lovely."
August 2021,superb stay in southwark suite,"couldn't fault the staff (we didn't arrive in the maclaren or lambo parked outside and still felt every single person we dealt with wanted us to have a perfect stay!), view, room service, breakfast, 52nd floor sauna. room tv not being 'smart' so no netflix/disney+ streaming for our kids was the only pain. great area to stay in for london weekend break."
September 2021,Wonderful views with Wonderful staff and food,"We visited this week to celebrate my daughters birthday with afternoon tea. The food and views from the hotel are superb. Our day was made extra special thanks to Jenny who attended our table with her joyful manner and professionalism. Thank you Shangri-la ( and Jenny) for a wonderful day we will remember forever.  Best wishes, Ben & family"
August 2021,Excellent overnight stay,"Amazing room, amazing service, amazing view and just an overall great experience - at a price. This was a once in a blue moon treat for us and whilst it was eye wateringly expensive you get what you pay for. The room was great but it's all about the views (38th floor) and we were looking directly at the city with tower bridge down to the left. Waking up in the morning and opening the blinds over the city was great. The check in was slick and painless (apart form the card swiping...) and staff very attentive. All the room amenities were as you would expect from a top end hotel.  We had dumped our bags at the hotel in the morning as we had an action packed day planned in London and they appeared in our room shortly after check-in. Very slick.  Really good stay and when that blue…"

September 2021,Mini moon,How fabulous was our two night stay after our wedding. The staff from the beginning to the end were amazing.

Mention to Leon and Nathaniel who looked after us so we’ll in Ting restaurant.
August 2021,Fantastic customer service,Just returned from an overnight stay at this beautiful hotel. It was to celebrate my husband’s 40th birthday and the service we received was outstanding.  The hotel staff can not do enough for you  A massive thank you to Sonia and Tyrone who really went over and above to make our stay extra special  The hotel is stunning the breakfast was delicious and we cannot wait to return  Thank you again
May 2021,Lovely place but rooms are basic!,We enjoyed the shard and would definitely come back for the experience again either in the Thai restaurant or the bar but the hotel itself for the price is very basic even though we did have a Bath with a view and one of the more upgraded rooms you are paying for the view rather than luxury!
September 2021,Gong Bar Afternoon Tea Experience,"We had my birthday celebration in Gong Bar.  The staff were fantastic, they made us feel like we were the only ones they were serving, that we were special.  We had an amazing view which our waiter knew exactly how to capture on our phones. The staff are completely professionally and impeccable in their hosting and delivery skills. Henry Bernal helped to arrange this amazing experience."
August 2021,Wonderful birthday at Shangri-la,"Spent the day at Shangri-la for my birthday. 5* service from begining to end. Amazing dishes, fabulous views and wonderful service from Jing, Simone and Nathaniel. Highly recommended and will definitely be back."
August 2021,"A perfect, five star experience","Our stay was everything we visualised and more, from start to finish.  The decor and interior at reception is second to none, and the staff are exceptionally helpful and friendly.   We were on the 43rd floor and it goes without saying the views were breathtaking. Our room was fantastic, and we loved every minute spent in it. The entire place was completely spotless top to bottom.   Dinner at Ting was fantastic, it felt really special and didn’t want it to end.   Before dinner we also had a cocktail at Gong bar on the top floor which had such a brilliant vibe. Could have spent much longer in there easily!   Breakfast was the highlight for us. Thankfully the buffet was open as normal, and I loved creating ‘a little bit of everything’ on my plate. Everything tasted fresh, pure and…"
September 2021,Rooms in the clouds,"Was expecting a whole lot more but can’t put my finger on what……. Hotel staff were all super attentive and engaging, view was beautiful from morning to night and plenty to watch as we enjoyed the bars and restaurants of Gong & Ting. Luckily we booked ahead of arrival as concierge confirmed on arrival that they had no capacity."
September 2021,Amazing Ting,"Had such an amazing experience thanks to Emilio, such a kind welcoming gentleman and smiley, and the food was amazing:)   Will deffo be coming back again in the future and maybe have more room for dessert"

Jimmy is very attentive and always had our cars ready upon arrival and cleared the pathways so we could exit and arrive safely , extremely friendly and professional and above all loves dogs . Hopefully next time we go back to stay Jimmy is on duty so he can be the one to greet us . A great person and makes the London experience much more pleasant. Thank you for everything.  The Mckenna’s"

September 2021,Amazing views,"We stayed at the hotel for our mini moon and had a brilliant stay! We stayed in a premier city room with views over Tower Bridge, the Tower of London and HMS Belfast. The room was very spacious, clean and comfortable.  We had a slight issue with our luggage making it’s way to our room which was eventually rectified and the staff provided us with a bottle of champagne to apologise for the error.   We ordered room service late one evening and although very expensive it was delicious!   Breakfast was tasty and the views from the Ting restaurant were fab.   The staff were very attentive and made us feel well looked after. We’d definitely recommend this hotel to anyone celebrating a special occasion."
August 2021,Wonderful Afternoon Tea Experience,"Came here for afternoon tea for my boyfriends belated birthday present. Amazing food with an amazing view! Welcome tea was a great experience and Jenny couldn’t have been more attentive - great friendly staff and a must to visit, we will definitely be back!"
August 2021,Birthday and anniversary celeb,The Shangri-la London hotel is top notch. One of the best. The staff were all friendly and accommodating. We had our breakfast at Ting restaurant and the staff named Jenny was very helpful in meeting our needs. She gave us a nice touching sweets for our Anniversary and mu girlfriend’s birthday. Highly recommended.
July 2021,Beyond all our expectations,"What an experience, from stepping into the lobby to leaving the hotel at the end of the stay it was just a magical time. We loved the staff, they were just so friendly and helpful and seemed genuinely interested in the guests, the room went beyond our expectations, it was perfect, comfy beds, fantastic bathroom, all the amenities you need and of course the view, we spent hours just looking and using the helpfully provided binoculars.  Food was magnificent, breakfast overlooking London was something I will remember for a long time. I went with my 10 year old son and we also visited the pool, swimming overlooking the view was incredible, we loved our time there and made memories to last a lifetime, absolutely worth every penny."
August 2021,Birthday Dinner,When arrived at the Ting restaurant we were greeted by Jordeen and Feona. The staff members very welcoming. The director Alan Tang  also came over to make sure that we were enjoying our meal. The sommelier Kat and Masaki were great. Overall the meal was fantastic and on top of that the view was spectacular. I would highly recommend to choose to stay at the Shangri-La hotel.
August 2021,"Beautiful views, great sleep thanks to quiet comfortable rooms.","The rooms at this hotel are fantastic - very much worth booking for an overnight stay even if Londoners like us. The views from our room (and I believe all of them) are amazing. Fantastic view reveal as you enter the room and the blinds come up. Lovely big bathrooms, comfortable beds and blackout blinds plus quiet rooms meant we had a great sleep. Very much appreciated early check in being arranged when we unexpectedly arrived early (having left extra time due to extinction rebellion protests). Helpful acts like this mean not the case in all hotels for example I find Four Seasons not good at that and is a chargeable extra or nothing.  Plus great extras like large bottle of water on arrival, bath salts etc. I really appreciate touches like this as will always use them but not…"
August 2021,Impeccable dining at Ting,"We ate at Ting within the Shangri-La hotel at the Shard. We had chosen to dine from the very reasonably priced three course set menu from which there was ample choice. The food was exquisite. The service was impeccable, our waiter, Leon, was attentive but not intrusive. And what’s more the views of London were brilliant."
August 2021,What a wonderful service!!!,"We had the most wonderful time celebrating my friend’s job offer. Jenny was a wonderful host, able to advise us on food and drink choice, incredibly accommodating and friendly. The main courses were delicious; although the dessert was a little nondescript."
August 2021,Memorable visit to Ting Restaurant,"Fabulous evening at Ting restaurant. Attentive and friendly service from all members of staff and in particular Sabrina and Nathanial. Superb views from our table, relaxed atmosphere and delicious, beautifully presented food, portions were unexpectedly large. Expensive, but given the location, views, service, quality of the food and overall experience this was to be expected and would definitely recommend. One suggestion, it would have been useful to explain the tradition of sharing dishes before we had chosen what to eat."
August 2021,Afternoon tea,"My wife and I visited for afternoon tea. We were very impressed not only with the quality of food but also with the friendliness and courteousness of the wait staff. We were served by Emilio who was polite and attentive  whilst not overbearing. Would definitely visit again, most certainly one of the best afternoon teas in London!"
August 2021,"Fantastic views, brilliant staff and lovely setting",We had a lovely time and our waiter Leon was very nice and knowledgable. We messaged ahead as it was my girlfriends 30th birthday plus I planned to propose. The staff were very accommodating and happy to help with all the above. Highly recommend. Great views and lots of photo opportunities as well.
August 2021,Special Occasion,We stayed one night and had dinner in the Ting restaurant. We booked 4 rooms for our Golden Wedding celebration. The food was good and so was the accommodation but most of all we found that nothing was too much trouble for staff. They were excellent. Definitely recommend a visit especially for a special occasion.
August 2021,Celebrating birthday of my wife with family,Fantastic restaurant and ambiance. Will refer to my friends and visit again. The food is very good. The quantity is qute filling.

August 2021,"Amazing sommelier Kat, great views","It was a great dinner with some good food and a very nice view. Kat, a very charming sommelier, made the experience really exceptional.

July 2021,Wonderful staff and hotel with captivating views!,"My best friend and I (both returning customers) stayed at this amazing and beautiful hotel on the 31st July for her 40th birthday celebrations. I cannot express the wonderful memories we had during our stay. To  all the amazing staff who were so helpful and honestly provided 100% customer satisfaction. Special mention to  Tyrone, who was incredibly and exceptionally helpful with my queries. I'm looking forward to my next family booking.  -Thank you for lastminute lovely rose and balloon arrangement."
August 2021,25th Wedding Anniversary trip,Amazing stay for our 25th Wedding Anniversary. Berta was excellent and ensured that our stay was made very memorable by her customer focus and care. Masaki and Nathaniel were excellent in the Ting bar and looked after us very well. One of the best hotels we have stayed at we will definitely return. Outstanding service 👍
August 2021,Not great value for money,"Our party of 8 stayed at the Shangri La for one night in August. Reception staff were very good, efficient and professional, our room was not ready but we could leave our bags with them and explore the city until our room was ready. The hotel phoned me to advise the room was ready which I felt was a nice touch. Our bags had been delivered to our rooms when we went into them. The rooms themselves although well appointed were disappointing for the amount we had paid for a nights stay, we felt they were practical rather than luxurious.  We paid for a 180 degree view from our room, this was a nice extra but not sure if it was worth the £150 upgrade. Our room rate included breakfast at the hotel. This unfortunately was a disappointment.  We were shown to the table and offered tea…"
August 2021,Superb service and attention to detail,"My friend and I stayed here for her birthday and retirement. Staff went out of their way to fit us in for afternoon tea. Afternoon tea was so impressive at the Ting restaurant, with the most spectacular views ever.   Breakfast was superb, as you would expect, and staff gave my friend a celebratory cake. Our room overlooked the London Eye and St Paul’s Cathedral.   Attention to detail was outstanding, and the hotel was beautifully decorated.  "
August 2021,Beautiful experience,"Beautiful surroundings, great service, and delicious food. Also wonderful views. We enjoyed our lunch at ShangriLa. The set menu choices were limited but the flavours were exquisite. Would define recommend as a special event - expensive but worth it."
August 2021,Birthday meal,"Leon and Nathaniel were truly the quality Shangri-la deserves, both were fantastic in their roles, knowledgeable, helpful, attentive and overall gave us a dining experience to remember, thank you so much, we will be back!  Connor & Laura"
August 2021,Fabulous - what a way to mark an occasion!,We dined at Ting to mark a special birthday and from the moment we stepped foot on the 35th floor to the moment we left it was magical! The views were spectacular of course and the food was divine (we chose Shangri-La specialties) and the service and hospitality was second to none. Very special. Thank you!
August 2021,Dinner at the Shangri-La hotel,"I had an absolutely amazing time dining at the Ting restaurant, and more importantly because I was served by Nathaniel. Nathaniel is a star, he made our stay worth it. Thumbs up Nath! Keep up the good service"
August 2021,Fantastic food and wine to match,My partner and I came for our anniversary. The hotel stay was simply magical. Cocktails in Gong were fab followed by a delicious 2 course meal in Ting. We were very well looked after by Simone and Nathaniel- thanks so much all!
August 2021,Fabulous view and beautifully prepared dining.,Beautiful Asian restaurant with British menu options that has outstanding views of London from the 35th floor of the Shard. Great place for a special dinner. Service was excellent and Leon was terrific. He has a wonderful sense of humor and is delightfully hospitable.
August 2021,Meal at ting,"Emilo was our server and he was absolutely amazing, he was unbelievably catering to our dietary restrictions and made us feel so welcome. The food was sublime and Emilo  was so helpful in helping us chose the best dishes for us to try. Can’t recommend enough!!!"
August 2021,Ting Restaurant,"We celebrated our 1 year wedding anniversary at the Ting restaurant and had the most wonderful time. The staff were so welcoming and friendly, made the evening very special. A huge thank you to simone and Nathaniel who waited on us and made out night fab. Thank you 😊"
August 2021,Shangri La Hotel,"I visited with my family to the GONG bar and it was a truly sensational experience, one that I look forward to again. I would like to especially thank Erangelos for his amazing care and looking after us!"
August 2021,Birthday lunch and drinks,My wife treated me to a birthday lunch at Ting restaurant. Brilliant 360 degree views of the capital. The Shard is a lovely experience and the 3 course lunch at the Ting restaurant was amazing. Thank you to Jing and Nathaniel for making our day an amazing experience   would 100% recommend a visit to this lovely restaurant. A great experience which we won't hesitate coming back again soon.
August 2021,Given up on service,"We have stayed at this hotel every year for our wedding anniversary since it opened including during August 2020 just after the first wave of the pandemic when the service was exemplary as ever.  Not this year - we had a catalogue of errors, mostly blamed on Covid restrictions.  I don’t understand how a hotel which could get it so right in 2020 when the Covid restrictions were greater can get it so wrong a year later and actually just not care.  If you want to experience exceptional service at a similarly priced hotel, then go to the Hotel Cafe Royal.  We went in July 2021 for my birthday so during the pandemic.  We were repeat customers but we won’t be returning."
July 2021,The holiday of a lifetime,"Took my three girls on a three-day staycation at the Shangri-La in July as we decided to be tourists in London for our annual holiday this year (due to Covid). We had the holiday of a lifetime! We booked a riverside Iconic Suite, had dinner at the Ting Restaurant and lots of dips in the infinity pool. While the hotel itself is amazing, it's the staff that make it super special. Thank you to Sonia and Rita (Silva) for checking us in and out and to Esmail for fantastic service at dinner. And thank you to all the staff who worked between 14 and 16th July, we felt very special and looked after. It was a really memorable holiday and worth every single penny."
August 2021,Beautiful view from the sky pool,"Had a great stay, just a couple of nights. The pool is great and the attendant even better, (Andzelika) . She checks in and helpful, passes towels to you as you get out of the pool, brilliant person. Josh checked us in at the reception, went through all bookings we needed, like sky bar, pool and breakfast. Berta, on guest relations is lovely.  Improvements could be, table service for breakfast, tea service to the table was slow, on the last morning we left without the tea arriving?  Lift up to the reception are often out of order, if both were broken what would you do?"
August 2021,Genuine review,"Booked a superior room for our 25th wedding anniversary- having previously stayed in 5* hotels I would say that the 3* that we have allocated to this hotel is generous. On arrival one lift was out of action, and had to wait 15 minutes to queue and check in not exactly 5* quality! With apology from reception staff.   The reception employee was very pleasant and informative.  However, on entering the room it was quite apparent that the upkeep of our room was not to a 5* standard - some furniture had scratches and the bidet did not work, I called the concierge twice to report the issue as advised by reception should we have any issues, but had no response so I decided to report the issue to reception, after queuing for a further 15 mins, a maintenance engineer was quickly…"
August 2021,Great,Had a lunch at Ting restaurant. Food was really nice and We were served by Marco who gave us the best service! High recommend :)  샤드 가세용 추천~! 음식도 매우 맛나요우~ 120파운드 주고 배불리 먹을수있어요~!~!~!뷰도 좋습니당 날 좋을 때 가면 더더욱 이쁠거같아요! 샤드에서 행복한 시간 보내세용~!
August 2021,JP,"Had an amazing time taking my girlfriend up here. Leon was our server and he was a great host, our advice to him is just to speak a tiny bit louder! (Masks make it hard to hear) The food was delayed a tiny bit, but the view more then made up for the waiting time. We really enjoyed our time here. 5/5"
August 2021,"Great food, unparalleled view and impeccable service from Leon",The boys and I dined at Ting restaurant today. The food was excellent and our waiter Leon was brilliant. The view from the restaurant was breathtaking; we could see the whole of London. Highly recommended!
August 2021,Shangri-La indeed,"Really we couldn’t have wished for more. Excellent service especially from Ketiola, who did work hard for us even bringing a cushion to the back of my niece who is expecting a baby.  The views were clear and quite amazing . The cloud drinks were exotic accompanied by dry ice ice streaming over the stand. A feast for the eyes, then a real feast began delicious savouries and cakes. The scones delicate too. Thank you so much"
August 2021,Anniversary Celebration,We had a wonderful stay to celebrate our Pearl Anniversary.  Josh in Reception was most helpful and engaging and gave us some useful information.   Our room was superb with fantastic views over London Bridge and the financial district.  It was large and well equipped and we enjoyed using the binoculars.  Great views from the Infinity Pool where the staff were very attentive.  Our meal at Ting’s was delicious and Emilio looked after us well.  We particularly enjoyed our chat with the sommelier.  The hotel staff knew it was our anniversary and there were some nice touches as a result.
July 2021,Fantastic Birthday Celebration,"Remarkable Hotel - We had a lovely experience at this hotel from the moment we walked through the door to the moment we left. All the staff were extremely helpful and made sure our stay was unforgettable. The room was absolutely stunning, the floor to ceiling windows made it feel like we were up in the clouds and the decorations and all the special touches made my girlfriend's birthday truly memorable. The spa was incredible with views over London, we enjoyed The Gong bar for dinner and breakfast in the morning was really nice with great variety of items to choose from. Overall an amazing experience and would love to go back. --"
August 2021,Anniversary meal,"Had our special evening meal at the Ting restaurant at the Shard. Friendly helpful staff, good food presented well with a good wine choice.

August 2021,Ting Restaurant server Emilio,Excellent service from emilio. Excellent food. Great service and always kept a happy face. Would recommend the japanese seared wagyu. As it is absolutely superb. The view is splendid and a great way to spend a birthday.
August 2021,Amazing,"My family and I stayed in the hotel 09 - 11 August. From the moment we arrived to the moment we collected our luggage to travel home the service was exemplary. Josh from reception showed us to our room and was so lovely to our 6 year old. The staff at the sky pool were so helpful and nothing was too much. Jing looked after us at breakfast and was so nice, again nothing was too much trouble and she was lovely to our little boy. Cannot fault this hotel, room immaculate and beds turned down. Thank you for an amazing stay."
August 2021,Ting - amazing lunch!,"We had an amazing lunch at Ting! We had the 3-course experience and children’s menu. Food was delicious and above all Leon who was serving us was exceptional! He was friendly, helpful and explaining every dish in detail! Thank you so much Leon!"
August 2021,Another beautiful stay,"I have stayed at this hotel a number of times now, and it is just so beautiful. Maybe one of my favorite hotels anywhere in the world! This time I stayed with my mum (her second stay), and our room (Iconic city view room) was just beautiful. The views are truly incredible.   We ate at Ting on the first night and I have written them a separate review. But I did feel that the breakfast at Ting was not as good as it normally is. The menu has been significantly reduced, and now they try and charge you extra to order from the menu which is a bit cheeky. The buffet itself was pretty poor compared to what it normally is. I do feel like they were trying to cut costs and you really shouldn't feel like that in a five star hotel. The service wasn't as good as it normally is either, it was…"
August 2021,Ting Restaurant,"Went to the restaurant to celebrate my mum's birthday. We all went there with high hopes and it certainly delivered. The view was mind-blowing! The food was exceptional!!! We met a waiter called Leon, who was a fantastic host. Her catered to our every needs whilst we were there and made sure we had everything we needed. Highly recommended 👌🏾"
August 2021,Lovely relaxing lunch with spectacular views,"Light dining lunch at the Ting restaurant with our 12-year-old daughter. Fabulous table, amazing panoramic view, relaxed soundtrack and great food. My elderflower & tarragon risotto was sublime. Service was excellent overall and our waitress, Jing, was particularly attentive and lovely. A definite highlight of our London visit."
August 2021,Birthday celebration,"We celebrated my husband’s birthday at the shard and so I treated him to a 5 course meal at Ting restaurant, our waiter Emilio was very polite and helpful from start to finish, couldn’t fault him and the service at all. We had a lovely experience, would  definitely come back."
August 2021,Birthday visit,"Our stay was beyond amazing! The hotel.. the room... the view.,. The staff! One member of the team stood out.. Jimmy the doorman greeting us as we arrived... he arranged a taxi for us... and  recognised us the following day for a chat... nothing was too much trouble!"
August 2021,Celebrations at Ting,We celebrated our friend’s birthday today and we really enjoyed the dinner. Gloria saw us at the entrance and she made us feel extremely welcome from the beginning to the end of our Ting experience! We hope to see her again the next time we visit.

August 2021,Amazing time,"I stayed at the shard for my 1 year anniversary and they made it as special as it possibly could be.   From the second we arrived the staff were attentive and helpful. They parked our car this was at a charge of £55 for 24 hours. They took our luggage up and we checked in smoothly.   Our room was amazing fitted with a bath overlooking London. The bed had rose petals on (my boyfriend had organised this before arrival)  I can not fault the room.   The pool area was the best but about our stay. Although we was not informed that you needed to book a swimming slot. The pool and sauna area is amazing and again all the staff are attentive and super helpful. There is complimentary water, hot drinks and fruit. You have to book an hour slot for the swimming area, I would advise to do this…"
August 2021,Birthday at the shard,"Massive thanks to Jenny at Ting restaurant in the shard! Had an amazing birthday and her exemplary service made it 10 times better!!! thanks jenny!!!

August 2021,A fabulous short break in the clouds,"Such friendly staff, nothing too much trouble. Happy to give advice and help with bookings. The swimming pool was a stunning experience - hard to swim when all you want to do is admire the view. Josh checked us in and out and it was obviously so important to him that we’d had a great stay."
August 2021,Fabulous hotel,Came to the Shangri-la at the Shard for partners 50th with our 3 children and it did not disappoint on any level. We had 2 rooms with a connecting door which was well thought out and works great for a family with young kids. Yes it was expensive but we had complimentary parking and buffet breakfast which was fantastic. The rooms are lovely and the children had a Superior which was massive. Nearby Borough Market has some great places to eat too and also the produce is excellent. London Bridge station is a short walk away and there was nothing to complain about. The concierge was super helpful and the door men all so lovely and great with the children too. None of us wanted to leave!
August 2021,5 star night!,"The night was great. Food was extremely flavourful, we had the lobster benedict to start with the beef short rib and the taste was so authentic. Same for the main courses of Wagyu beef and tortellini! Highlights of the night the great service of Emilio and Nathaniel. Fantastic and spotless! Very professional, precise and they gave us a memorable experience!"
November 2023,Great service at Brown’s Hotel ,"Great service as usual from the tremendous staff at Brown’s.

November 2023,Spa Experience ,"I visited the spa for a aromatherapy massage, the overall experience was amazing, was greeted by the professional and welcoming receptionists Olga and Hannah, smiles on there faces and made me feel so comfortable, then the massage was so relaxing and Aurora did such a good job at giving me advice to release the tension in my back and made the massage so personal and made sure I was comfortable and overall was an amazing massage, thank you so much! "
November 2023,Best Place,All staff is amazing! We were at a business trip and we had a lot of points of concern and all staff wa all the time so kindly and gently to help us! The hotel and the service is amazing and perfect! This is my favorite place to star when I am in London.

November 2023,A perfect break in central London,"Browns is essentially faultless. Understated and in perfect taste this is a very English experience. The service is outstanding, friendly and personalised. The beds really are very comfortable. Oh, and the Martinis are quite perfect."
November 2023,Hotel with a very special charm.,We stayed in this beautiful hotel for 3 nights and we really enjoyed it.  This time we went there with our small child and they have prepared so many nice things for him in the room. He was super happy. Also the employees are very friendly and helpful.  & I love the interior design.
November 2023,Perfect retreat in the center of the city,"A perfect retreat for my husband and I. The service was impeccable, and the staff made you feel like this is home. The central location made every site within east reach. The food was amazing, and it was a joy to come back at the end of each day and truly relax. "
November 2023,Absolutely fabulous and truly superb in every way.,"Totally love Browns’s Hotel!  I stayed for a long weekend and hosted a number of friends to stay and to dine in Charlie’s Restaurant and enjoy superb cocktails in Donovan’s Bar. Every member of the Team at Browns made us feel so welcome and every wish was catered for.   The food was delicious, the service was fantastic, our rooms were luxurious and the location was perfect.   A truly special and memorable stay in a very special hotel.    We could not fault anything and can’t wait to return."
October 2023,Lovely afternoon tea," I recently had the pleasure of enjoying a delightful afternoon tea, and it was an experience worth it. We booked it for one of my friends birthday and they add an extra touch to our experience. The assortment of pastries and sandwiches were delightful.  Highly recommended."
October 2023,Delicious food and cosy and elegant environment ,"I have spent a lovely afternoon yesterday at the tearoom of the hotel. I went there for a business meeting and I couldn’t have chosen a better place where to bring my colleague. The setting is amazing and staff is a 5+ *.  We had the pleasure to meet Rocco at the tearoom, who professionally suggested a nice drink after explaining our tastes. After the drink, we had the pleasure to meet Antonello, who told us the story of the hotel and highly recommended to visit the hotel again in order to taste the lovely dinner menu. I will surely visit again the hotel and the restaurant and I highly recommend this hotel to everyone, who wants to spend a great time in London or simply to enjoy an afternoon drink. Environment 5* staff 5*."
November 2023,History meets luxury ,"Spend 5 minutes with Ivan the porter while Ivan the porter gets your taxi. He provided a quick whirlwind tour of the hotel and the historical significance. He is well informed, proud and delightful! 10/10"
October 2023,Afternoon Tea and Drinks at the bar afterwards ,"Wonderful afternoon tea with a good friend. The service was exceptional, sandwiches, sweets, teas just amazing. We also went for couple of drinks to the bar,which was amazing too. I highly recommend Brown's Hotel London. "
October 2023,Perfect stay,"Our stay at the Brown's was just perfect. The room was super clean, and really pretty. The staff, needless to say, incredibly polite and always there to help. The doormen especially bring the experience to another level, as they are an extension of the concierge, with stories and advices. The Donovan's bar is really happening during pre dinner time, with great drinks and delicious bar food. And the staff at the bar is also very professional and friendly. Final comment for the reception. Unfortunately I don't remember the name of the lady who checked us in. There was a little problem with the room assigned to us. She took charge, never made us feel worried or uncomfortable, and she swapped us, very quickly, to a room that was just perfect. This hotel is one of those places that…"
October 2023,Treat yourself and stay at Brown's,"Brown's is hands down the best hotel in London and I've stayed with all of the well known ones over the years, and have travelled extensively in my business career.  What sets it apart is the brilliant team, from front of house to cleaning. Donovan's bar is a great spot, the breakfast is one of the best anywhere, and the ambience of the hotel exudes class and style as you might expect from a Rocco Forte Hotel.  The Friends membership benefits make a difference too - they'll do their best to provide early and late checkin's/checkouts and they really value regular travelers. "
September 2023,What a treat!,What  treat!  We have stayed in many 5 star hotels.  Brown's is right up there in the 5 star category.  We had a lovely room with suburb service.  The hotel staff are all excellent and very helpful.  The breakfast buffet was extensive -  what a great way to start your day!  It is close to the green street underground and easy walking distance to most everything.  Don't wait for a special occasion - stay there now!!  We will be back - hopefully soon. 
October 2023,Three Nights at Brown's Hotel,"The rooms are wonderfully appointed and comfortable, the spa is not to be missed and we felt well cared for and attended to by all of the staff.  The bar experience is pure entertainment and the cocktails are inventive and unique."

October 2023,Wonderful stay,"We stayed 9 nights, recently, at Brown's. Our suite was beautiful and very comfortable, beds were great. Everyone on the staff was extremely nice and very helpful.

July 2021,Absolutely amazing service,"We visited for my 30th birthday, we had spectacular  views from our room and my husband had decorations and cake arranged also which was a lovely touch.

May 2021,Wedding ceremony and reception at the Shangri-La,"My wife and I recently had our wedding ceremony and brunch reception at the Shard Shangri-La hotel. The room, the space (Ren-B room and Sky Lounge) and the views made it a perfect location for our wedding. We and all the guests enjoyed it. The whole Shangri La team and event manager made it an unforgettable experience. Everybody was very welcoming and helpful throughout including the receptionist, the porters etc, helping to set up the ceremony room the day before, as well as allowing us extra time with the guests to cut the wedding cake and enjoy the brunch reception. I highly recommend the venue and the hotel, and cannot compliment the staff at Shangri La hotel enough. We also thoroughly enjoyed the suite as well as the infinity pool and bar on level 52. Looking forward to…"
July 2021,Impeccable service 👌🏽,"It has been a wonderful experience. From the time that we entered the premises, everyone has been very warm and welcoming.   The view from our room was amazing too especially during sunset. Shoutout to Johan for the room that was assigned to us. We appreciate the personalized note/letter from Sonia (Guest relations), the decoration and ofcourse the note on the glass wall too.   We had drinks in Gong and was accomodated well by Daria. For dinner, we went to Ting and also had breakfast there the next day. Jordin was so sweet and Danny made sure that we are alright. Dinner was made more special by the attentiveness of Kat and Francesco.   Our stay was short and sweet but it has been unforgettable. Will definitely recommend and will be back again."
July 2021,Ting restaurant,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the shard and went to ting restaurant. Our server was Emilio, he was amazing 10 out of 10 service, so polite, jokey, friendly, so informative!

July 2021,21st Birthday Celebrations,Our experience was superb! From checking in to checking out every staff member we met made us feel so welcome and couldn’t have done anything more for us. A special shout-out to Josh!  We will be back..!
July 2021,Dream come truw,"Our stay at Shangri La Hotel at The Shard was for my 30th birthday (celebrations delayed a year due to covid). On our original booking we requested a room with a bath tub with a view. On arrival we were told that no rooms with this feature were available. We asked the lovely Rita C to recheck for us. RIita spent about 30 minuets tapping away on the computer and ringing colleagues. She then returned to us to tell us it has been possible to find this room but there would be a short wait for room inspection. We were over joyed, so much so I actually cried! (happy tears of course)  The room was jaw droppingly beautiful. The view was of Tower Bridge and the Thames and was spectacular. And the bathroom! 😍 It was a dream come true. We also had coffee in the Ting bar and cocktails in…"
July 2021,5* luxury ,"We stayed a night in the iconic shard suite, and it was HEAVEN! Everyone was so welcoming and couldn't do enough for us. The breakfast, although pricey, was delicious and the gentleman who delivered it to our room was a ray of sunshine. The complimentary cake delivered to our room was very gratefully receive. We visited the pool on floor 52 which had amazing views and was tended to by lovely gentleman waiting poolside with a freshly laundered towel. We did not visit the bars or restaurant but on our return in the evening we were greeted with live music floating up from the Sky Lounge.  We had a truly memorable stay which we will treasure for many years to come"
July 2021,Lovely summers evening,Fantastic visit to the sky lounge for drinks with friends! Such a great experience and the views! Henry in particular made our evening complete with his attention to detail and his lovely personality! Thank you!
June 2021,Top class service,"Know you're staying at a great hotel known for service when it starts at reception. Tyrone upon checking was polite and friendly and a great example of 5-star service.  As a semi regular guest, it's always nice to be recognised by staff members. Given lockdown in London was over a year and not being able to stay as often as i had, i was amazed that Jordeen from Ting restaurant recognised me and took me straight to my table i was joining. It's those little things that separate the hotel from others.  Lastly, need to make mention of Nic the chef for making my favourite fish dish ever a Hibachi rib. Had it twice in three nights :)"
July 2021,Magical weekend,"Recently stayed here with my boyfriend for a weekend and we were completely blown away upon entering the hotel and our stunning room. The views, service and food was outstanding and the staff made us feel at home. The stay was worth every penny and was completely magical. I was very lucky to have my requests honoured which included a bath with views overlooking the city, including tower bridge. A very romantic hotel which succeeds in making you feel like royalty during your stay. I would also like to say how incredibly thankful I was to receive the complimentary champagne and cake which was organised by a colleague. This was such a lovely surprise that we enjoyed whilst relaxing in our bath overlooking the city in daylight and at night! One bath a day isn’t enough when your view…"
September 2023,Superb Sunday lunch,"We returned once again to the lovely Browns Hotel.  This time for lunch in Charlie’s. What a splendid lunch it was too! The food was outstanding, as was the service.  The ambience was calm and relaxed, but professional, as you would expect from Browns. One of the best Sunday lunches we have ever had, if not the best - thank you! If I was to comment on one tiny thing, the cauliflower cheese was too strong tasting for me personally."
July 2023,Facials always 10/10,"Every time I come here I am treated like a VIP even though that’s the last thing I am! I try to come every few months as a special treat and will definitely be coming again soon. Aurora always gives the most amazing facials during which I often fall asleep which, although  embarrassing, shows how relaxing they are and my skin looks noticeably amazing afterwards! Can’t wait to come back!"
September 2023,So nice I stayed twice! (In one vacation!),"My husband and I stayed at Browns for 5 nights on his business trip. We absolutely LOVED the hotel. The rooms, the decor, the restaurant as well as the bars were all superb! At the end of his business trip we thought we would try another hotel for a few nights before leaving for Paris. I checked out  of Browns and literally came RIGHT BACK ! The other hotel was supposed to be a 5 star establishment but it was so small and dusty/ dirty, the staff was also cold and not welcoming. I took one look at the room and called Browns right away and said “I’m coming back right now! “ the front desk at the Browns immediately helped me to check back in and even kept my old room for me! so yep, it was so nice that I stayed twice during my whole time in London ! To me what made the Browns stand…"
August 2023,"Brown's Hotel,  Dining Room, and Donovan's Bar","Every aspect of our stay was outstanding.  Specifically, the restaurant staff was welcoming and friendly.  The dining room is one of the prettiest dining rooms we have visited.    The concierge staff gave  excellent advice that helped us maximize our short stay. They arranged our itinerary perfectly. At the time of check-in, the front desk staff gave us thorough orientation to the hotel. Donovan's Bar was the perfect venue to meet a London friend for a drink.  We look forward to staying at Browns when we return "
August 2023,To celebrate a special birthday,"We loved our stay at Browns, everything absolutely fabulous.  The location is unbeatable for Mayfair and the West End and we particularly enjoyed the intermate feel the hotel had.   Every thing about our stay exceeded our expectations.  "

January 2023,Superb special occasion afternoon tea,"We went for Afternoon Tea, a return visit, and this was just as good as the previous ones.  We were treated so well, the service and charm were impeccable and the food amazing, such generous portions too.  It's the perfect place for a special occasion and we look forward to an excuse to return again!"
August 2023,A Perfect English Experience,"We had four magnificent nights at Brown's in a excellent accessible suite that we needed.  Other activities  included:  Cocktails at Donovan Bar including time in the 'Naughty Corner' featuring photo's by Terence Donovan. Fortunately, for us, a new cocktail menu 'Evoke' had just been released so we enjoyed cocktails with names like 'Adrenaline', 'Martini Roots', 'Big Smoke' and more all were excellent.  Breakfast's and Dinner at Charlie's was a great experience. We were surrounded by photos and ceiling decor inspired by Rudyard Kipling's 'Jungle Book'.  The location was excellent close to major tourist attractions whilst being quiet compared to tourist areas a few blocks away.  We also took advantage of the House Limousine on a couple of occasions - a really special experience. …"
August 2023,In the mood for Afternoon Tea,"Went with some friends to experience Brown's Afternoon Tea. The space and ambiance is inviting and comfortable, a classy experience. Customer service was very attentive, specially our hostess Maria who made sure everything was perfect, giving us background on the inspiration behind the menu, suggestions on tea's and parings, as well as sharing wisdom on the hotel's history and some of its most illustrious guests of the past. Great experience, truly recommend."
May 2023,An amazing historic hotel.,It is an excellent hotel. Elegant with a lovely atmosphere. The service is impeccable and all the staff made us feel at home away from home. The afternoon tea is highly recommended. Finally the location of Browns is amazing. Right in the heart of the city. Highly recommended.
May 2023,One of the best!,"We travel often and to nice hotels and this was one of the best hotel experiences we've ever had. They listened to our request for a quiet room; went out of their way to find restaurants, etc for us; were very pleasant with every interaction, etc. Plus, the location is terrific and the hotel is a beautiful boutique. "
May 2023,Absolutely Incredible,As expected of Browns our experience was superb. Givi and Simeon looked after my Fiancé and I very well and made us feel very welcome as did the rest of the staff during our stay. Our room was wonderful and perfectly presented. We ordered room service as we checked in which arrived promptly as we were heading out for an appointment. We had the Sunday lunch the following day at Charlie's which was absolutely fantastic. We love staying at Browns. The fact you feel like you are at home whilst you are there is something I can't say for other establishments. We very much look forward to our return later this year.  
April 2023,Amazing Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel with our two kids under 5 years old and had a great experience.  They went above and beyond for our two young children.  The hotel is situated in a great location in Mayfair within walking distance to multiple sights, restaurants, and shops. "
April 2023,Amazing stay,"Had 2 amazing days with my son. From Check in to departure everyone was extremely helpful and friendly. From the Moment we entered we felt like Family coming Home eventhough we Never stayed there before. The Room was amazing and the bed the most comfortable ever.

The restaurant is also great. We are comming back, much better than The Ritz. "
April 2023,"Phenomenal experience, can't wait to return!","Our experience with the Brown's Hotel was beyond expectation. Ahead of our arrival in London, Gerard, Richard, Lee, and Andreea in the concierge department helped us to book our tours and dining reservations, providing helpful suggestions, which was much appreciated (first time in London with my kids). Then, from the moment we arrived at the hotel until checkout, our experience at the hotel was excellent. The staff was friendly, helpful, attentive and went out of their way to ensure that we had a great stay. We have a large family with a range of ages and each of them received special attention from the hotel; age appropriate toys in the room, child size robes and slippers, even a tabletop nightlight similar to those we had at home (they loved all of it). We spent Easter in…"

April 2023,A magical week at Browns,"From the moment we walked in the door of Browns, it was magical.  The entire staff was so professional and accommodating.  We have stayed at Browns in the past but the updates they have completed have made it even more wonderful.  We traveled with our family, grandkids 15, 12 and 10 and their parents.  Everyone was delighted with the service and accommodations.  The hotel is also located in the best location...close to everything that a tourist might want to see.  Highly recommend!!!"
April 2023,Our favourite hotel in London!,"We stayed at the Brown's for the second time over the London Marathon weekend and just like our first visit, it was truly amazing and special!   The location, the staff and service provided is nothing like any other.   Every special request we had prior to our arrival was promptly dealt with by Irene and Charles from Guest Relations.   Upon our arrival we were able to check-in early and due to taking part at the marathon we were also able to check out late which made a world of a difference to us on the day.   The food in both at Charlie's and Bar Donovan was amazing and we cannot wait for our next visit.   The Brown's is truly the best hotel in London and we couldn't recommend it enough!   Thank you for your whole team for looking after us so well and making us feel like we are…"
March 2023,6 Star Service!,"I would give this hotel 6 stars if I could. My husband and I came here for a work trip (3 days) but stayed for a week and had the best hotel experience to date. We usually stay at 4 or 5-star hotels but the biggest difference we felt with this hotel was the service and the people. The building itself is beautiful and they have the most divine scent when you walk through the lobby! The breakfast was incredible. The eggs benedict and crab omelette were superb! We did the afternoon tea as well and the little sandwiches were so tasty, tea was the perfect temperature and you can tell they have a pastry chef making all the desserts. It was my husband's birthday while we were there and I forgot to mention anything to the staff until 10 PM that night, so we went out for a drink when we…"
March 2023,People at Brown's makes you feel at home,"Recently I stayed at Brown's hotel for 1 night with my friend whom I haven't seen since C-19 started. It was our reunion after nearly 3 years. The moment I walked in I felt like I am at home and every single employee was my family who is loving and caring. I was welcomed by doorman Ivan who's warm smile was the first amazing moment which will stay in my memory. At the front desk I was greeted by Gianluca who provided efficient check in and ensured that if I need anything he is there to help me. With Gianluca we had a lovely and easy going chat. Before going to my room I met Alex from reception team who kindly offered help bringing my bag to the room, he greeted me with warmth and very friendly smile. Later my friend finally made it to the hotel and we went for dinner in…"
March 2023,A luxurious experience that felt like Home!,"I recently visited Brown’s with my partner and I must say there’s no better place we could have spent our anniversary. The service was impeccable, all the staff were so attentive and friendly and the environment of the hotel was so warm that felt like home! Special thanks to Simeon and Givi for the warm welcome and particularly to Charles and Irene from guest relations who took such great care of us and truly personalized our experience with the thoughtful amenities and little touches in the room! The Brown’s Suite that we stayed at was Amazing! We also dined at Charlie’s restaurant where the food was to die for !!! and Luigi our waiter was very professional.

March 2023,friendly luxury.,"welcomed with such warmth the moment we took our first step inside. A very genuine warmth from each member of staff that has stayed with me since I've left. I can't wait to return. Staying at Brown's is utter luxury, friendly doormen welcoming you back after each trip into the city like you are being welcomed into their home. They can't care for you enough and it all felt very natural. the doorstaff are true gentlemen. the rooms and service are  10/10, comfy beds and perfect added extras. Make sure you have a drink in the opulent bar and afternoon tea in the drawing room by the fire. See you soon Browns and your wonderful friendly staff."
March 2023,Warm and friendly with,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Brown's Hotel. I felt welcomed and well taken care of. My stay started with a very warm and friendly welcome by John and Givi. At the reception desk, I was greeted by Mamadu. Theodora was ever so lovely and offered to show me up to the wonderful room they chose for me. We enjoyed our dinner at Charlie's; the food was absolutely delicious (the sea bass and clamps were to die for). My friend and I were pleasantly surprised by the warm welcome from Paul, Lucian, and the waiter who served us.  We also stopped by the Donovan Bar as well, and for an unusually busy day, the team was very efficient. Martina was very helpful and gave great recommendations on what cocktails to try (and they did not disappoint at all). Daniele and Federico were very…"
March 2023,"Beyond exceptional, personal touch, perfect for family!","I don’t often write reviews, but sometimes you come across a place that is so exceptional you just have to let the world know. The Brown’s Hotel, and frankly all Rocco Forte hotels are beyond exceptional at baseline. Bring your family, and you will experience a whole other level. The amenities for children are wonderful and fun. It’s not often you go to even a luxury hotel that not only makes you feel special, but like they want you to be there. From the front door men, reception, the concierge, in-room dining, the restaurants, and housekeeping, everyone does their job well and has the most welcoming, classy, yet down-to-earth way of interacting with guests. The design of the hotel is both traditional, and cheerfully contemporary. We love the beautiful design vignettes around…"
February 2023,Memorable stay!,"We had a wonderful one-night stay in a cosy suite on the fifth floor. Many thoughtful little touches for our child and handwritten wishes made the day extra memorable. The same night, I also sampled Charles' dishes and cosmoline, both outstanding! We had breakfast delivered to our room the following morning, which is how a perfect day should begin. We are grateful to Brown's staff for this special experience. Irene, Barbora, Gianluca, and porter Givi received special recognition."
March 2023,Feeling pampered and treated as royal ,It was a magical stay. We even got an upgrade to a junior suite. The attention to details throughout the hotel is beautiful. Most of the staff works there for many years and as returning guests we feel very well taken care of. Breakfast is always a highlight too 
November 2022,Mr. Paul the waiter service the Afternoon Tea,"Paul the waiter was amazing, he treated us so lovely. Please ask for him when you go he will make your evening amazing. The afternoon tea was incredible and the service was 10/10 with constant smiles from the whole team. "
November 2022,What a wonderful hotel!!,"I have stayed with my family at this amazing hotel for three nights and it was just wonderful. Everyone was so friendly and attentive. The service was incredibly great from arrival to the seasonal amenities, from the dooman to the bar staff.  We loved our rooms with a useful connecting door. Everything was well maintained and clean."
November 2022,Best Teatime in London,"I had the best teatime ever! My friend and I enjoyed the fresh selections of sandwiches and desserts!  Look for Paul, who served us, he was so sweet and professional which made our experience unforgettable! Definitely coming back again! Great food, amazing location! Such a beautiful English tradition hotel in the middle of most beautiful area in London "
October 2022,First Class Afternoon Tea,"  I have been meaning to write for a while to say a thank you to Yonka and her team (I cannot recall the lovely male manager’s name, which is remiss of me) who looked after us all so well at a 30th birthday afternoon tea that we had with you on on the 1st October this year. As always they were delightful and our children were so well looked after.  We look forward to seeing everyone soon for our annual Christmas afternoon tea. A wonderful team and the afternoon tea was not only delicious but also plentiful    "
October 2022,Best afternoon tea in London!,"By far the best afternoon tea experience we had in London! The tea sommelier is excellent, the shrimp salad sandwich was delicious, and the pastries and scones were great. The service was far more attentive than anywhere else we have had tea. "
October 2022,Wonderful Time at Brown's Hotel London,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Brown’s Hotel last week – we cannot stop smiling!    From the warm welcome we received from the Brown’s driver (Dragon) to the Bellmen (Daniel was amazing – as were the rest of the kind bellmen), to the reception and concierge professionals friendly and supportive assistance, Charlie’s restaurant hostess, wait staff, and manager who made our meals memorable (and delicious) , the housekeeping staff who always kept our rooms beautiful (the fresh flowers were an unexpected and lovely touch – thank you!), to the Brown’s Spa personnel who helped me relax on our much needed vacation, to finally the bartenders in Donavan’s bar who made us laugh and end each night happy and excited about the next day’s adventures.  I had spent many…"
September 2022,Walking Girls' Lunch Treat,"The restaurant in Brown's Hotel, Charlie's, is as fabulous as ever.  Beautifully decorated, sumptuous seating with plenty of space between tables, it was an absolute delight to return with 5 guests.  Having been given one of the tables with the semi-circular banquette seating on one side with beautiful cushions, felt like a treat in itself rather than having a conventional table and chairs. The menu was so alluring that we couldn't resist having 3 courses rather than the usual 2 when dining together. Four out of 6 of us were delighted to find calves liver and bacon on the menu, which was delicious.  However, I remember one guest enjoying a delicious Salmon En Croute as the special that day which would also have got my vote, being a lover of pastry.  As usual, the service was…"
October 2022,A very English experience,We dined at Charlie’s at the hotel. What a lovely experience starting with the pre dinner cocktails which were much enjoyed. The quiet ambiance of the restaurant was echoed by the excellent and attentive staff and the food was of a  very high standard and presentation  (although I thought my steak tartare was a tad lacking in seasoning and a bit wet). We will certainly return.
October 2022,Old school charm meets modern quality,Super friendly and professional especially Charles from guest relations. Made our trip special with personal touches agreed in advance. Wonderful room service team and food; champagne on ice placed when requested; huge comfy super king in our suite; etc etc etc. For a classic treat with modern touches; choose Browns!
September 2022,The Best Ever,"Our first visit here, and hopefully not our last. Wow, and double wow. Every single aspect of our stay here was perfect, from the moment we arrived and the fabulous staff who made us feel welcome, to the gorgeous room (way bigger than we expected) and then fabulous drinks in the bar and a 5 star dinner at Charlies. Even the breakfast room service (an extra treat for us) was fabulous. Couldn't fault a thing - the most special hotel we have encountered."
September 2022,Sunday Afternoon Tea ( 60th birthday ),Myself and 7 others were at this hotel for afternoon tea on 4/9/22 @ 2pm right from the lady ( Bianca ) who handled our booking who was so helpful and polite to the waiter who served us who has a unique way of serving champagne with the glass high in the air  this gentleman was just born to be a waiter very polite and helpful also very attentive but not over the top which made for a very relaxing afternoon. The afternoon tea we had was just superb and off the scale and i have got to say myself and all of my guests have been very lucky in life to have eaten across the world at many venues but we all agreed this was the best afternoon tea experience we have ever had . All of the staff we met that day are a credit to your brand. Kind regards  Robert Edmead
August 2022,The BEST family hotel in London.,"We stayed here for a family treat and it was exceptional. A home away from home! My stepdaughter Bea who is 4 years old absolutely loved it and we did not want to leave! From the warm welcome to the special amenities for children, everything was perfect."
August 2022,A fine lunch.,"An impromptu visit for lunch in Charlie’s with my son James  was made a memorably enjoyable occasion by the warm welcome and faultless service we received. From Kitchen to Front-of-House each member of staff could run a master-class on how their job should be done. How reassuring for any visitor to know that pure, relaxed pleasure awaits when you step over the threshold of Brown's Hotel and then enter Charlie's under the direction of the Master; the inimitable and charismatic Jesus Adorno."
August 2022,what a joy to be back at Browns for another fabulous night's stay,"It always feels like coming home - the welcome is second to none from the moment you drive up outside to the moment you drive away.   The perfect evening started by checking into one of the stunning suites, quickly followed by martinis and Ruinart in the Donovan Bar (brilliant cocktails and such friendly service) and ended (after supper with friends) with more of the same back in the bar before a superbly comfortable night's sleep. Impossible to have a bad night's sleep - the  beds and bedlinen are heavenly.  Delicious cooked breakfast the next morning delicious as always.  All in all a huge huge treat - we look forward to returning soon."
July 2022,Always great to be there!,"Another wonderful stay at the lovely Brown’s! I stayed there a couple of days last month and I everything was great. This time I had the chance to meet Givi who was so helpful before my departure, I wanted to thank him so much. Hope to come back soon!"
August 2022,Browns afternoon tea continues to be one of the best in London. And Yonka creates a memorable and joyful experience!,"Brown’s continues to serve one of the best afternoon tea services in London. And Yonka makes the experience that much more memorable and joyful. With her extensive knowledge of all the available teas at Brown’s, and her warm and caring personality, she made our family gathering that much more special. Thank you Yonka and all the wonderful staff at the Brown’s Drawing Room!"
August 2022,40 th Stay and Birthday celebrations,"I just want to say a massive thank you, for all your help and support in making my wife's 40th the best.  Everyone from start to finish couldn't have been more helpful and catered to all of our needs.  We will 100 % be looking to stay again shortly.  A special mention goes to Paul in the restaurant as he was so great with our boys when they arrived on Sunday.  Thank you again.  Many Thanks  Adam Upton"
August 2022,Excellent lunch at Browns,"Travelled from the Midlands for lunch at Browns ,3 cousins and a friend .We were warmly greeted by the doorman and on entering the restaurant we were complimented on our smart outfits. Our lunch was excellent,the crab starter was delicious,good choice of menu and the service was superb. We had a lovely time ,our first visit to Browns,can’t recommend it enough and will certainly return in the autumn . Thank you to everyone at Browns !!"
July 2022,Amazing location,"The browns hotel is in a perfect location for tourists as it is close to many attractions. A quick walk gets you to the Thames, across the street has the best shopping in London, down a little bit you’ll stumble upon the changing of the guard ceremony at St. James Palace. The staff is very friendly and eager to help in any way that they can. The hotel is very clean, with a lovely bar and restaurant on site. I cannot wait for my next visit to London just to stay at the Brown’s hotel!"
July 2022,Home from Home,"This hotel really is our home from home. This visit was booked so we could attend the theatre and see Sister Act. We received a very warm welcome from the doorman John as he welcomed us back to the hotel. It is lovely that you are remembered and greeted so warmly. At checkin we were allocated a room at the back of the hotel with a courtyard view. We always ask to have a street view room so we’re disappointed. Very quickly this was acknowledged and a new room was allocated. After a quick freshen up we headed for afternoon tea. We have enjoyed afternoon tea here before, but new cakes and such a varied array of teas makes this an joyous adventure all over again. The service is second to none and so much food to enjoy. John arranged a taxi for us in readiness for the theatre so we…"
August 2022,"The perfect tea time: elegant, comfortable, and delicious!","The atmosphere was wonderful. It was both very fancy and very comfortable at the same time. The setting was intimate. We liked that the doorman greeted us, and we enjoyed the live piano during the tea. The service was great.   The tea selection was absolutely amazing. Each of us got to choose individually a tea to have during the savory part and then a second tea to have during the sweet part.   Each guest chooses individually between the two menu options – traditional afternoon tea or plant based (vegan) afternoon tea. That worked out very well for us. Two in the group chose the traditional afternoon tea, and two of us, who are vegetarians, chose the plant-based afternoon tea.  The sandwiches were excellent. The meat eaters loved the coronation chicken ones, in particular. The…"
August 2022,A lovely overnight stay,We had the most wonderful time at Browns hotel this week. Beautiful suite so stylish and comfortable.  Staff real friendly and helpful.  Meal in browns restaurant was very good. I loved the grilled prawn starter and they had pistachio ice cream on the menu a lovely surprise and ending to a meal.  Amazing choice on breakfast menu and it was delicious.  A visit to Donovan’s bar really worth it recommend honey bear cocktail.
August 2022,Best ever Afternoon Tea!,"We have just had the best Afternoon Tea ever! Nothing was too much trouble for the friendly and efficient staff. We were asked more than once if we would like more of the gorgeous sandwiches, scones and cakes. At the end, we were presented with another pot of tea. Cannot recommend Brown's enough."
July 2022,Weekend at Brown’s,"My wife and I had a 3 night stay at the Brown’s hotel. It was wonderful. We had a great time, everyone from the doorman to the front desk were courteous, helpful and pleasant. The room was wonderful, the bed was comfortable and the living area was very nice. The hotel was located in a safe area and walking distance to many sights. Would love the opportunity to stay there again."
July 2022,Amazing experience,"I have had an amazing time at the Brown’s hotel, it’s a gorgeous place and the staff are lovely and so accommodating, they always stop to have a chat! I will absolutely come again next time I am visiting."
July 2022,Birthday Tea,"My brother and I had an incredible experience for afternoon tea at the Brown’s Hotel in London. Our server, Rocco, was funny, charming and very knowledgeable of the menu and hotel. He made sure all our requests were met, having personally read our reservation notes. The live piano music was such a nice backdrop and the food is delicious and just keeps coming! Thanks, Rocco, for a wonderful afternoon!"
July 2022,Great traditional hotel,I can’t say enough about how wonderful this hotel is. Truly a five-star experience With personalized service. The location is perfect for exploring London. Close to shopping and the Palace. Irene at Reception and concierge Dave head were friendly helpful and truly interested in making your stay terrific
July 2022,Afternoon Tea,"We've just had a wonderful Afternoon Tea at Brown's. It was so lovely stepping into the elegant, airy Victorian Drawing Room out of the intense heat. Paul, our principal waiter, immediately set the tone for us - he was such fun. The food was absolutely delicious. After the sandwich selection (we loved the coronation chicken in particular and our daughter said that the Vegetarian selection was the best selection she'd ever had), came the most delectable scones ever. They were sooo good, along with the yummy strawberry jam (which can be purchased). These were followed by delicious cakes, then more cakes - so it was good we hadn't asked for more sandwiches! The little grape tarts, the  Baked Alaska tarts and the little cream buns were divine. The Victoria sponge was also gorgeous.…"
July 2022,Fantastic service at superb hotel,"Brilliant hotel with wonderful staff and a unique and special team.  We could not be more impressed with Browns.  What makes it so special is the incredible team and service culture.   The rooms are also superb and Charlie’s restaurant excellent.  We loved the Sunday night Jazz. And,  just to mention the wonderful Browns team again!!"
July 2022,Mrs,"Excellent visit to Browns spa with 3 friends, we all had different treatments which we would highly recommend. Beautiful products and surroundings , polite friendly staff, all very relaxing and enjoyable with a visit to the Donovan bar before hitting Charlie’s restaurant for supper ."
March 2022,First choice without doubt!,"I return here most weeks for work because of the extremely friendly, professional and courteous staff. The accommodation and facilities never disappoint. Dennis the general manager is just brilliant, nothing is ever too much trouble, and it’s always lovely to see John’s smiling face to greet you at the front door!"
February 2022,Wonderfully attentive service in a beautiful setting,"My stay started with a  lovely welcome by the front desk and the staff who took care of every detail. While I’m staying at the hotel for a  vacation in April, I found myself there after my son who is studying abroad ended up in the hospital with tonsillitis. To say they made us feel at home would be an understatement! Dennis - the wonderful guest experience manager sent up bath salts, fruit and chocolate covered strawberries to welcome my son out of the hospital. Chris, the amazing concierge arranged for a humidifier and great reservations once we could head out and the Rado and the room service staff brought tea around the clock!  We cannot wait to head back in April and look forward to another fabulous stay."
February 2022,Quintessential London,"What a wondrous experience Brown’s is. Situated in the heart of Mayfair, it was a perfect location for my 3-day visit of the capitol. I absolutely loved the hotel’s décor being a mix of both traditional and contemporary. The room was very spacious and cosy. The Donovan Bar was so very London with an amazing buzz and energy coupled with a perfect service.  But for me, probably the best part of my stay was the Staff. From the Reception staff to the breakfast Team, to the front Doormen to the waitresses at Donovan’s. The attention they gave to make my stay personalized and special was wonderful. With just the right balance between professionalism and personal attention, I think Sir Forte can be proud of his Team.  Thank-you all again for making my stay memorable. I WILL be back!"
February 2022,Off the chart amazing!!!,"Simply superb!! What more can I say? Saturday night and packed to the rafters yet still our service was sublime. Maria our hostess was quite Simply AMAZING, she was a great host but still had time to have a bit of banter with us. Truly one of the best waitresses we have ever met. Then the food, OMG, it was incredible. I would recommend to the highest degree "
February 2022,Wonderful stay!,We cannot recommend Brown’s highly enough for anybody wanting a special hotel stay. Attention to detail was second to none and we truly felt special on our birthday/anniversary visit. Thank-you  again.
February 2022,Wonderful Stay - As Always,Had another great few days in London at Brown's. Always to be treasured. Impeccable service and a fantastic restaurant. The staff are warm and genuine and go out of their way to help without being intrusive. One of a kind......
February 2022,"good hotel, god location. good service",This is a good hotel with a very good and dedicated staff to make you enjoy your stay. very important during these days. Food and beverage quality are good too. maybe some improvement could come from the kitchen. breakfast is very good but dinner dishes may improve a little. service is great. cleaning of the rooms too.  the hotel has a very good location for all kind o purpose (work or visiting).
February 2022,"Fourth stay, probably the last","Brown’s is a hotel in a beautiful old building. We have stayed here 4 times now  and it has some wonderful friendly staff and does, on the whole, make it feel like you are in a home away from home. Dennis was especially wonderful during our last stay. However, for a 5* Hotel it has shortcomings and falls below others in this price range. Occasional bad experiences are expected, but Brown’s doesn’t seem to listen to this feedback and use it to improve. Sadly it is unlikely we will be coming back again. Many of the rooms are very tired and while cosy and well designed, are in need of renovation. Their age is showing, especially in places such as the stained bathroom floors and general wear and tear to the furniture. Other oddities are the choice of a cheap kettle, basic Nescafe…"
February 2022,Amazing place to stay,"The stay was amazing. Big rooms, lots of common space, delicious afternoon tea.  Personal was very polite and helpful, especially Givi our consierge  was great! Located just in the center, close to bond street."
February 2022,An excellent hotel with wonderful people,"We spent four wonderful nights at Brown’s and we can only recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for an exceptional experience. The whole team was amazing, but our special thanks go to Francesca at the reception desk and Lee at the conciergerie for their kind help and hospitality. We are looking forward to our next stay."
February 2022,Our Second home,"Amazing suites, exceptional, professional, caring and kind staff. This has been our second visit in few months as a family and everything was great and very well looked after. An experience of a life time. Thank you and goodbye till we meet again soon!"
February 2022,Amazing! Best hotel in London,"From start to finish the service was impeccable. The suite was stunning with every luxury you would expect. My two young children were made incredibly welcome and special touches were added just for them. None of us actually wanted to leave. The best staff, the best service, the best hotel and all in the best location."
February 2022,Best hotel in London,"Great doormen, great rooms, great bar, great service. I first went to Browns for Sunday afternoon tea in the 1980s and without losing any of its original charm it is now, in my opinion, the best hotel in London but keep it secret."
February 2022,Cocktails,"Fabulous cocktails as always In the 'bar' you are still required to stay at your table and they come to you, which if you're just drinking is not always the best However we love the cocktails and the bar area We are yet to try the food but on our next visit we will do"
February 2022,"Completely Overwhelmed , From Start To Finish.","Thank you doesn't really seem adequate. The team at Browns Hotel truly made my Mums birthday weekend. I understand that you have special guests all of the time, especially with it being Valentine's weekend, however they really did go above and beyond to make every single thing perfect.   From start to finish, Olga in the Spa gave my mum a wonderful massage and made her feel comfortable and relaxed. The concierge team were always on hand to help and Francesca honestly did do everything in her power to make this trip memorable.   My mum was taken away by how wonderful everything was, honestly.   This is some of the best service I have ever witnessed and received. The team at Browns hotel do the Rocco Forte Hotel brand proud, it was a complete pleasure and we will be back one day…"
February 2022,Afternoon tea,Afternoon tea was great. The food quality was really good and the service was excellent. We were hungry earlier than expected and they accommodated us despite being 2 hours early for our reservation. Yonka served us and taught us all about the teas we were drinking and the history of afternoon tea. She gave great recommendations and she was really funny. She made it a memorable experience
January 2022,Beyond compare,"This really has to be one of the very best hotels we have ever stayed in. It was impossible to find fault, no matter how small, with any aspects of our stay. The rooms are superb, the hotel position could not be bettered, the restaurants and bars are top class but most of all, our thanks go to the staff for making our stay so enjoyable. Their commitment to providing the very best in service is so obvious and nothing appears to be too much trouble for them. Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff - what more could you ask for?"
February 2022,Excellent service,"We came for dinner yesterday and we were impressed by Charlie's Restaurant's staff. They made our evening by taking care of us and smiling all the time.  On our arrival, Silvia greeted us with a bright smile. Luigi and Chloe made sure everything is perfect. It is obvious they all have great customer skills and knowledge about the menu. We want to thank them again for the excellent service they provided and for making us feel so special.  We recommended Charlie's to our friends 🙂."
January 2022,Weekend treat with family,"Fantastic and seamless service from start to finish - Brown's always know the meaning of five stars. The pre-stay service, check-in, support throughout and dining experience was exceptional on every level."
January 2022,Family trip,Amazing beautiful and friendly five star hotel in top location! We stayed there with my teenage sons and it was perfect for them going out. The concierge was super helpful and the doorman so nice!  Thanks we will be back for sure. Carolin
April 2022,A special hotel,"We have stayed in several other Rocco Forte hotels which have all been good but Brown’s is a cut above. We were visiting for an anniversary and birthday celebration and the staff could not have given us a better welcome; this was equally true in Donovan’s bar and Charlie’s restaurant. We had a slight issue with our room and this was resolved quickly and generously with an upgrade to a lovely suite. From the bed linen to the decor, everything was top quality and carefully thought out. We found breakfast service a little slow in the restaurant but room service was terrific and arrived promptly. Whilst such excellence comes at a cost it is worth it for a different level of hotel service."
April 2022,First Class Friendly Service,We only stayed at the hotel for one night but we have never received such amazing service than we did at the Brown's Hotel.  From the moment we stepped through the door the service was amazing. We were made to feel welcome and nothing was too much trouble.  Even on the day we were leaving they made us feel special right to the moment we walked back out through the door. The rooms are comfortable and clean and all amenities you could think of. Would highly recommend this hotel for your next stay in London.
April 2022,Afternoon Tea,"What a luxurious afternoon tea! The staff are attentive and generous (i.e. extra portions without needing to ask) and there is a wide selection of tea. The sandwiches were scrumptious, the scones light and fluffy, and the sweet pastries were dainty and delicious. It's well worth the price."
April 2022,Brown’s Afternoon Tea Never Fails to Amaze!,"Brown’s is our go to place for our tea adventure in London. For the second time, we had Yonka as our server m…affable, friendly and full of information about Browns!  The good is truly unique and delicious…a one of a kind experience when in London!"
April 2022,Celebration of birthday,"Excellent hotel, courteous and welcoming staff. Despite its high price, it is worth the effort and stay in it 😊 It makes the London experience more pleasant. Front desk staff are helpful and so the concierge staff"
April 2022,Wedding Choice of Hotel,"Chose as a different hotel for our base for our Annabelles wedding celebration , little upset with the room as it was poky and I had paid for an upgrade but the staff!!!! Throughput the hotel they are simply magnificent from Donovan's to the other bar in the other side and special mentions to John on the door and the wonderful Ivan"
April 2022,"Beautiful, Warm and Engaging","The location of Browns is incredible. Close to Green, Hyde and St James’ Parks as well as an amazing amount of shopping and sites. Location aside though, the hotel is beautiful in every way. It’s warm, it’s uniquely British but most importantly the staff are wonderful and very caring to the comforts and enjoyment of guests."
April 2022,Afternoon tea experience,"Wonderful drawing room. Selection of teas great. Recommend Cornish tea. Sandwiches delicious, scones great and strawberry jam so so good. Battenberg cake really. Wonderful server Yonka was a delight.   A really good experience for a special birthday treat."
April 2022,Superb stay at Browns hotel,"Wonderful stay at Browns hotel, London. Was upgraded to a deluxe room and served a complimentary glass of champagne on arrival.  Afternoon tea in the drawing room was divine and service was impeccable. Thanks to Givi and Simeon who took care of my luggage and always greeted me with a friendly smile at the entrance."
April 2022,Love London,A fantastic hotel in the center of London. Spent a weekend with my wife at this boutique hotel with the best of service! A special thanks to Givi and Simone who really made our weekend a pure pleasure!!😃 I also noticed that the bar have one of the most fantastic varieties of whiskey and cognac I have ever seen!
June 2021,Afternoon Tea,"We loved our afternoon tea at Browns today. Yonka, a most informative, lovely lady made the whole experience extremely memorable. Describing herself as a ‘Tea Sommelier’, she introduced us to teas from her extensive tea library, that complimented each part of our journey through the Chef’s exquisite sandwiches, scones, preserves and cakes."
June 2021,50th Birthday celebration,"My husband and I recently had a stay at Browns Hotel to celebrate my 50th birthday. I have to commend the hotel as their attention to detail was just superb, their care and kindness in the way we were treated was beyond any expectation we had had, we left feeling truly thought of and totally satisfied that my special weekend was really taken into consideration. I shall from now on consider Browns Hotel  as my first point of call for any other celebratory events. The welcoming and personal touch that we had bestowed upon us from every member of staff throughout our stay was really appreciated and very touching. A special thank you to George and Francesca for taking care such good of us as soon as we arrived from then on our stay just got better and better. Mr and Mrs Ferguson"
June 2021,Superb from the moment you walk in...,"A wonderful place to stay, a luxury hotel with truly wonderful staff, great food and that something extra - an authentic desire to give you a fabulous visit and to create great memories. I have stayed here on four occasions over the past couple of years and it has just got better and better. My first choice when stashing up in town."
May 2021,Relaxing Afternoon,"Lovely afternoon/evening spent with friends. The food was good. Our waitress Miriam was attentive and knowledgeable about the wine. Would recommend to friends. Looking forward to our next visit. We was able to sit outside as it was the weather was good,"
May 2021,Beyond outstanding ,"This has firmly become our home away from home. It’s, quite simply, the best hotel in London. What makes Brown’s so exemplary? The understated, yet sophisticated decor; the sublime food and experimental cocktails. But, it’s the staff which elevate this beyond any other hotel in the UK. On the back of lockdown you’d excuse a slip in standards. Not here. Service is personable, friendly and warm. Each member of staff shines, making your stay beyond perfect. A special mention to Abigail in Charlie’s who is quite simply an outstanding restaurant manager. Her personable, yet professional, manner makes her stand out, I can’t think of anyone else who has made me feel so special, anywhere. And, Dennis who oversees multiple stays, ensuring we are looked after. His dedication to provide…"
May 2021,Exceptional level of service,"From the moment we arrived the service was nothing short of exceptional. The team at Brown’s made us feel so welcome through our stay. George Hiley-Jones was the very example of what others should aspire to be and do in the luxury hospitality industry.  We were very kindly upgraded to a junior suite which was fantastic. Asked for a late checkout and ""yes"" came back immediately, none of this ""tap tap tap"" on  the computer to see if they could accommodate. They even serviced the room for us during the day of our late checkout to make sure we had everything we needed.  One of my favourite things was getting my shoes shined overnight, and finding them the next morning outside the door in their own leather bound box. Details matter.  We had lunch each day of our stay at the hotel and…"
June 2021,Great return,"I just spent last weekend at Brown’s - first time since lockdown and it was so nice to go back to all the familiar faces, the unbeatable service, nothing was too much trouble, the exquisite food, the superb atmosphere in the bar, and even the weather was good! This is such a great hotel, a perfect mix of extreme luxury with a relaxed atmosphere. It was a perfect break and Stuart Johnson, John McLean, Alex Wilson and all their teams are the consummate hosts and work very hard for all their guests."
May 2021,"Great Service, Food and Staff.",My wife and I stayed at Browns to celebrate my wife's important birthday. The hotel was fantastic at giving us plenty of memories to cherish  A really upmarket hotel but in no way snobbish.  I managed to get a 3 nights for the price of 2 deal. Expensive but worth every penny.  I cannot recommend highly enough everything about this hotel. Staff food and service were fantastic.
May 2021,The best hotel in London.,"From our first greeting upon arrival through to departure, our two nights spent at Browns were absolutely wonderful. All the team made us feel so welcome. The hotel has a real home from home feel and our children were treated to some lovely surprises. We will certainly be re- visiting again. The best location and hotel in London. Thank you Browns."
April 2021,So good to be back!,"The lockdown has been hard for so many people and the thought of a break away has kept us going for months. Brown’s hotel has always been our chosen hotel when we visit London and we could not wait to go back. It lived up to our expectations and exceeded them! As always we were greeted at the door, luggage taken care of and a glass of champagne during a swift check in. Everyone was following the government social distancing guidelines and wearing face masks however they still made us feel at ease and relaxed throughout our visit. Every member of staff took time to speak to us, check we had everything we needed and seemed genuinely pleased to be welcoming guests back to the hotel. I can not imagine how hard the last year has been for the staff and thank them all from the bottom…"
August 2021,Baby friendly great visit,"We stayed with our 1 year old son and we were all made to feel most welcome! Whilst the chauffeured Bentley isn't available at the moment, the hotel is really well placed for parks and shopping. We were upgraded to a junior suite and the hotel provided a baby bath, cot, toys, baby products and much more. He loved it and we felt at home. We were also made welcome in the restaurant for our meals and the staff went out of their way to ensure our son was happy. Recommended for a luxury baby friendly holiday. Thank you to the hotel team!"
August 2021,Wonderful,"From the moment we arrived we were made welcome by the doorman, luggage taken straight to our beautiful, comfortable Junior suite.   The large room had every amenity and so quiet.  The front of house staff were exceptional.  They went out of their way to make our stay special.  It was an amazing experience.  Breakfast was perfect and the ambiance of the room made it relaxing with fresh flowers abundant throughout.  We cannot fault Brown's hotel."
August 2021,A five star home from home,"Many hotels claim to offer a home from home. Browns is the real thing - warm, personal and friendly from first contact to departure -   five star service and facilities as expected at this price, but without the aloofness which sometimes goes with. Room was generously sized, pleasantly decorated and very comfortable, with a huge bathroom. As an older woman travelling alone I was neither patronised nor made to feel out of place in the lively bar.  Lovely treatment in the small but perfectly formed spa.  Delicious food and an excellent choice of wine by the glass in Charlies restaurant. Special shout out to Joao in reservations, to Concierge Chris for dining out suggestions  and to the bar manager on Friday evening for their attentive service. I will definitely be back."
August 2021,Afternoon Tea,I went for an afternoon tea at Browns with friends. I have had afternoon tea here many times before this recent visit did not disappoint. Staff are very attentive without being obtrusive. Finger sandwiches are beautiful & fresh with a lovely range of fillings. We were offered additional sandwiches & couldn’t refuse! Scones were light & delicious with the jam & clotted cream. There was a really nice selection of cakes with two standouts- a vanilla & almond choux bun & a chocolate cherry tart. I wish I’d got the names of the staff that served us as they were both so lovely & helpful- nothing was too much trouble. Oh & you can try as many teas as you like to accompany your afternoon tea! Another wonderful experience at Browns to be repeated.
August 2021,Amazing experience,"We had an amazing experience with Angela M, she is such a lovely person and made our evening a pleasurable time. Totally recommend this place.  We loved the puddings and the atmosphere. Great place to eat and drink"
August 2021,Faultless,Faultless ! Every member of staff was exceptional and the service outstanding . The room had great power shower and separate bath . Perfect location in Mayfair . I will definitely be returning with hope of being able to use the spa facilities .
August 2021,"A wonderful experience of customer service which goes the extra mile, and staff who enabled us to have a wonderful stay","We were made to feel special from the moment we arrived at Brown’s Hotel, from the glass of champagne, to an upgraded room, to the concierge service arranging cars from the station and back from the show we saw. Nothing but as too much, impeccable service on every level. We felt cared for the entire time of our stay"
August 2021,"Tranquility, luxury, fine fare and personal service","An overnight stay to celebrate a ""big"" birthday. Could not have been a better memory! Made welcome from the moment of arrival to our departure. Upgrade room to a suite - decor discerning and calming. From afternoon tea, dinner in Charlies to a sumptious breakfast - absolutely first class cuisine and look forward to going back to Charlies. Can't recommend highly enough"
August 2021,Beautiful hotel with attentive service without being to ostentatious.,"Stayed at Browns for three nights and didn’t disappoint. A luxury hotel in the middle of Mayfair and it had everything you would expect from a hotel of this standing.  A special thank you to George, the doorman, who every morning was there to greet us and ensure we had everything in hand for the day.  We happen to bump into Stuart Johnson the managing director of the hotel in the lift who was friendly and welcome and interested in our experience of the hotel ."
July 2021,Midweek break,"A wonderful 5 star experience. It’s a beautiful hotel staffed by an excellent team who looked after us so well. Delicious breakfast, and wonderful cocktails in Donovan’s bar. We’ll definitely be back."
May 2021,25th anniversary ,"Our first visit to Browns and only booked last minute due to cancelling Savoy due to bars and restaurants being closed in the week. On reflection this was a blessing as the hotel and staff were amazing. We were treated like royalty with nothing too much trouble. From arriving and met by John we were checked in by Dennis who had upgraded our room to a suite so we could celebrate our 25th anniversary in style. From then on things just got better and better, we would like to say a massive thank you to all the staff for really looking after us and making our two nights stay a real pleasure. We enjoyed a lovely, well presented room service, a delicious evening meal in Charlie’s restaurant and drinks in Donovan’s bar where all the staff were incredible.  We will definitely return as…"
May 2021,Fabulous London hotel,"We stayed at Brown's Hotel for three nights to celebrate our daughter's graduation.  The hotel went above and beyond at every opportunity to ensure a fabulous stay for ourselves and our guests. Chris at concierge managed to secure us a much coveted table at Spring Restaurant. Alex and George at the front desk were kind and welcoming, even finding us a quiet room after a stormy night made the roadside rooms a little noisy. We had afternoon tea in the beautiful drawing room and were taken care of by the tea sommelier, who opened up a whole world of tasting opportunities. The cocktails in the bar were legendary and when the girls had sampled all of them, the barman invented a few new ones. And the wonderful team of doormen always had a brolly on hand and a smile to welcome us back.…"
April 2021,London’s best hotel!,"Having stayed in over 50 London hotels, this has been my best experience.  Many top hotels have similar facilities and amenities but few can rival Browns as an oasis of tradition, calm and outstanding service.  The cocktail bar Donovan’s (voted one of the worlds best) is a real treat and very popular, so be sure to reserve a place! Charlie’s restaurant is an utter delight, refurbished but still evidencing all the traditional attraction. The food is outstanding both in terms of variety and quality. A great wine list compliments the menu and unlike many other hotels I’ve stayed in in London the pricing is not absurd.  Wonderfully airy rooms in the heart of London with a spa and world class service will ensure we return to the hotel in which Kipling penned The Jungle Book What sets…"
May 2021,Calm and discreet yet warm and welcoming,Super stay at Browns. Everyone so focussed on our comfort and satisfaction.  Such a cosy and relaxing place - but yet just steps from the hustle and bustle of the west end or Mayfair’s fine shopping streets.   A real treat. 
May 2021,A Magnificent Evening with Friends,"From the moment John opened the car door and welcomed us back to the hotel, we relaxed into the warm and friendly atmosphere knowing we were going to be looked after.  We had brought friends for drinks in The Donovan Bar and dinner at Charlie's and Mr Mclean and his team were on point as usual.  There is a seemingly effortless elegance to the service throughout the hotel and it is a pleasure to be looked after by them.  The atmosphere in the Donovan bar was buzzing and we loved the Breakfast Martinis.  Our friends enjoyed the cocktail list which has something new to tempt us every time we go. They also enjoyed our old favourite, the Spicy 50.  We moved through to Charlie's seamlessly and were welcomed by Abigail and Gian Luca who made sure we had everything we wanted.  The…"
December 2020,Afternoon Tea,"I have decided that I don’t get afternoon tea and need to stick to my guns and not do it again.  Browns is one of my favourite hotels and it is absolutely beautiful at Christmas.  The service is discreet and you are made feel special.  The food was fine, although the sandwiches we bland with a laser beam of filling; I struggled to differentiate what the fillings were!  The scones were beautiful and the cakes fine but if I’m being honest a bit disappointing.  My last AT was at Lucknam Park and it was the same, so I’ve come to the conclusion it’s me not Browns.  On another note always a lovely time at Donovan’s Bar!"
February 2021,Outstanding service,"Staying in London on business, supporting the supermarket sector. We stayed overnight and had a very warm welcome on arrival from George, who looked after us during our stay. The room was amazing, the bed was extremely comfortable and we would highly recommend the hotel and George.  George has a very promising career ahead of him.  Thanks again, we will be back."
January 2020,Business Meeting - Tea,"Beautiful Brown's Hotel was perfect for high tea in London. Gracious service,  scones with clotted cream was fantastic.  The tea selection was excellent. Make sure to have a reservation before going and enjoy the time there!"
December 2020,Simply excellent with flawless staff,"A one night stay.  It's really impossible to find fault with Brown's:  - great location just off Piccadilly  - has a long history and tradition but has a very special atmosphere - luxurious and intimate feel, not at all stuffy - well appointed and quiet room, despite overlooking Dover Street.  Well sized bathroom; great shower and bath  - original cocktail menu and good quality breakfast   But what makes this hotel is the staff.  Every member we came across - doorman, bar staff, reception, room service etc - was excellent; attentive, friendly, went the extra mile etc.  Impeccable.  And excellent COVID protocols without ruining the feel of the experience; it felt very safe.  A remarkably good hotel."
December 2020,Effortless luxury in the heart of Mayfair,"This beautiful hotel is located in the heart of Mayfair so is perfectly placed for shopping, restaurants and any other Central London activities.   The room was generous in size, spotlessly clean and the bathroom and wardrobe rather large. All of the staff were very courteous and attentive, and the bar is definitely worth stopping by for a drink or two. We felt particularly safe with the hotel's protocols in this time of pandemic and look forward to returning to stay again.  If you are looking for seamless customer service in a stylish and special but not stuffy hotel this is the place to stay!"
October 2020,5 Stars are not enough,"We have just returned from another memorable stay at this amazing hotel. During these difficult times we had to postpone my 50th birthday celebrations which, we were due to celebrate at Browns in March. Six months on, Browns made this special birthday one I will never forget. The staff were so attentive, always had time to stop and talk and wanted to make our time at Browns special. All government guidelines on Covid-19 were adhered to however this did not take anything away from making our stay comfortable and amazing. During these unprecedented times, managing to operate within the guidelines and still give the customer that special feeling, may seem impossible, but Browns have managed it and in our opinion exceeded it! I can not thank the management and staff enough for…"
September 2020,"Beautiful surroundings, outstanding service","I visited the Drawing Room at Brown’s recently for Afternoon Tea with a small group of colleagues. The wood-panelled room is as charming as ever and the traditional afternoon tea is immaculately done - starched linen table cloth and napkins, delicate china and a delicious array of finger sandwiches and pastries as well as scones of course. The waiters are only too happy to bring you more of the food if you would like as well as a fresh pot of tea. And all accompanied by a live pianist. A real oasis of calm and grace in these troubled times. Special thanks to our terrific head waiter Karol and to the super friendly and helpful receptionist Luca. Can’t wait to go back!"
September 2020,Browns in St James’,Chose this hotel as very centrally situated and close to New Bond Street for shopping and the Ritz for dinner. Super welcome by George and then at the desk by TeO. Marco was very good also as was the pleasant Sicilian waitress in Donovan’s bar. We had asked for a quiet room and that was what we were given. Everything was there in the room and the bed was exceptionally comfortable. Very good turndown service. Bumped into Sir Rocco Forte and he said hello.  All in all one of the best London hotels that we have visited. Will go again.
September 2020,Afternoon tea,Wow just wow!!!. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left we felt special. So let's get down to our tea. A great selection of finger sandwiches. They even did cucumber and coconut butter sandwiches for me as I can't eat cheese. Every one of the sandwiches so tasty. As for the selection of cakes and scones mouth watering. You must have their home made strawberry jam. More of a taste of fruit than sugar. We both liked our tea I had the Cornish and TOH had the Browns afternoon blend. They even made TOH a little chocolate mouse cake for a birthday treat. Not sure of our waiter and waitress names were but thanks very much. I just hope the photo's do the food justice.
March 2020,Luxury & Service,"From the moment the doorman opened our taxi door we were treated as if we were the most important people in the world. Stunning building, beautifully decorated and well appointed. We were given an upgraded room upon check-in so had the most fabulous suite which was stunning as was the bathroom and the comfort of the bed was off the charts. Browns is part of the Rocco Forte hotel group and you can NEVER go wrong with them. For us a slice of decadent luxury is needed to refuel the soul and the Browns hotel did just that. Thank you"
May 2019,Everything is Perfect! ,"It's such a lovely boutique hotel in the heart of Mayfair. The vibe was great, the staffs were friendly helpful, the room was spacious and super comfy. Overall, the hotel quality was superb! We'll definitely come back when we visit London again and will recommend this to our relatives and friends. Keep up the good work!  I still remember every detail in our deluxe room. "
April 2020,Everything was superb ,"Stayed at the Brown's Hotel a few years back. Loved it. One of the oldest hotels in London, the service is very good. The location is super convenient and the service is super comfortable, just across the street from old Bond street. Good breakfast, I don't remember how much, very touristy, don’t know whether it’s a good thing or a bad thing, The only downside is that the hotel rooms."
May 2019,Just outstanding ,"The hotel is very  historic, quiet and elegant The location is great for London visits and getting in and out of the city. We were truly amazed by the impeccable service there. Very spacious and stylish rooms. Would recommend for sure! "
December 2019,Wonderful sTaff,Staff were amazing with my little trip to visit this hotel a number of weeks ago. the attention to detail was outstanding! Made me feel very special.  Nothing was too much and i will be returning again in the near future.
March 2020,got here just in time!,I stayed at Brown's for the few days before London and the rest of the world shut down. They could not have been nicer. Staff was helpful and proactive with the needs of someone who had to leave very quickly.
December 2019,Fabulous hotel in the heart of Mayfair! ,We stayed at this hotel over a weekend.   The first thing that struck me was the interior of the hotel. The reception was painted with the most amazing patterns and colours. It made the hotel seem very luxurious as soon as we entered. After we checked in their was stolen mince pies and mulled wine which was delicious.   Mayfair at this time of the year is beautiful as all the shops are very Christmassy.  Our room was very spacious and had a lovely bathroom and plenty of storage.  The breakfast was amazing as well and I had an omelette which was very tasty.
December 2019,Very welcoming. Attentive staff,"Very comfortable bedroom. Impressed with the attentive staff and no request too much trouble. Excellent location and central for shopping etc. We have stayed in a few of the ""better"" hotels in London but Browns overall is top of the list."
November 2019,like at home,"the position is fantastic, you can go everywhere in few minutes the reception is warm, with a chimney, like at home the bar and the restaurant were very cool all people in reception and the waiters were very kind"
September 2019,Beyond excellence ,"A huge thank you to Dennis and the team at Browns for creating a truly unforgettable stay for my wife and I on our wedding night. They all went above and beyond in both preparation and execution, the room was beyond fabulous and the addition of a few special extras for our big day were absolutely exceptional. We’d love to do it all over again and look forward to our return visit!   Furthermore, it was a real pleasure and a surprise to go back and visit Browns again recently, and Dennis and the team came through 10/10 again! Outstanding.   I honestly could not recommend this team enough. "
December 2019,Amazing Spa,I booked the the littles ones spa treatment for my daughters birthday. Her and best friend had an amazing time due to services. I have never come across such great staff and very professional. Definitely will be going back
December 2019,Extremely poor nights sleep,"Booked a double room, to find 2 single beds pushed together! This does not constitute as a double bed. We called down to have the room made up to a double bed, which they said they would do. On returning after our evening out, the room had NOT been made up but felt it was too late to call down again. My husband fell out of bed during the night.  We complained in the morning about the room and were offered a 10% discount, which we found quite insulting when the room charged was £705.00 per night. This was our first stay and definitely our last.  On the plus side, the door staff were so welcoming and friendly."
October 2019,English Tearoom,"My husband and I enjoyed an afternoon tea here. The food and champagne were delicious and there was an amazing range of teas to choose from. The staff were attentive and helpful, and also discreet. The surroundings are elegant and peaceful, away from the bustle of the city. An added enjoyment was a pianist playing quietly in the background. Absolutely recommended for a special treat."
November 2019,Very Great location in London,"The Brown‘s Hotel is a very great location in London. Fine service, wonderful food and drinks and absolutely friendly. Many thanks to Sophie Bayly Jones, Claus Banczyk and Antonio from the best breakfast in town. Door men and Concierge absolutely friendly. The Brown’s Hotel is the best hotel in class. Thank‘s Sir Rocco Forte and team."
December 2019,Fantastic stay!,"WE just had the most incredible stay at Brown's hotel in London.  Very well located and the service is second to none. It was my husband's 50th Birthday, and the hotel concierge, Dennis, helped me organize a cake (with photos of my husband on it!) and balloons for the room, when we arrived! Just all around fabulous stay, beautiful old hotel that felt like home, and incredible staff who greeted us by name, each day when we had breakfast at Charlie's or just opened the door as we left or returned. I highly recommend and will stay here again!"
November 2019,Overall a pleasant stay,"The hotel is for sure one of the best in London. I do not particularly like the rather narrow, albeit pleasantly retro entrance from Albemarle Street as I do not find the Reception particularly comfortable and easy to access given the (three) steps you have to walk down to reach it. The fact that you have noone to help you with your luggage makes the check-in even more uncomfortable. Maybe we were not particularly lucky or... welcome - although we are a very decent couple travelling very frequently and staying in 5+ star hotels all the times, so I believe we are used to comfort and I can guarantee that we are always welcome. Never mind. Rooms and floor service (turn-down, floor management etc.) impeccable: 10/10. Decor of room, floor corridors as well as bar and dining areas…"
August 2019,Great Afternoon Tea,"My friend and I had classic afternoon tea at Brown’s Hotel London. This is our first trip to London, and trying the traditional afternoon tea is one of our best experiences. At well-designed English tea room, we enjoyed the delicious food and tea. Yonka and Zoltan provided pleasant services and made our experience even more wonderful. I recommend this place for a traditional English afternoon tea."
August 2019,Top Rate Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon Tea at Brown's Hotel is not to be missed.  The food is exceptional, especially the Prawn Cocktail and Coronation Chicken and they have an amazing Sparking Tea.  Yonka, Karol and Zoltan provided a first rate and very friendly service and I cannot speak highly enough of them.  10/10"
August 2019,Wow -Browns Hotel Did It Again,"I attended a private event yesterday hosted by Browns Hotel, and the staff could not be any more attentive, there was nothing to much for them. The day ran smoothly and the team was very organised in getting everything done.  The service as always was five star and attention to detail was amazing. From the flower decorations to the table set up, everything was a WOW when you walked in. Jamie, Alex, Kasia, Mahmet, Reggie and Tariq was fantastic and a  true definition of Team work. I will be telling all my friends and clients Browns is the place to be."
May 2019,"Wow, David!",Months later I found David’s business card in my wallet and it reminded me of what a wonderful time we had at Brown’s hotel having high tea. We can’t wait to go back and thank you David for such a memorable experience.
July 2019,Afternoon Tea,Afternoon tea at Browns the whole experience was fantastic.  We were welcomed from the time we entered to the time we left. Our hostess Yonka was exceptional in her knowledge of the menu and the teas in particular. She made you feel very relaxed in how she informed you of what you were eating and where the teas were from. I would recommend Browns for afternoon tea to anyone. I would come back again.
July 2019,Afternoon tea,Really nice experience to enjoy afternoon tea at Brown’s hotel close to Piccadilly Circus. Mr Lorenzo took very good care of us. It was live music and beautiful interior. Strongly recommended! We were two adults and two children.
July 2019,High Tea with Yonka & Zoltan and Drinks with Luca & Roberta,"My wife and I have been in London for about a week having gone to some terrific places such as the cocktail bar at the Duke's hotel and other similar experiences. As good as those were, enjoying high tea and being cared for by Yonka and Zoltan was a truly unparalleled experience that we are certain to repeat during next time's visit.   Yonka & Zoltan were truly passionate about taking care of us and they shared a tremendous amount of knowledge regarding the teas' histories, the pastries, and all the delights. What sets them apart was not just their knowledge and excellent service, but their true love of hospitality. Thank you Yonka & Zoltan!  After spending a little over 2 hours at the tea, we shared with Yonka how much we had enjoyed the Duke's hotel and she explained how the…"
July 2019,"Lovely Service, Charming Atmosphere ","The afternoon tea itself was overpowering, lacked direction and left us very full but with patisseries and cakes that were nice but not to die for.... this pricey afternoon tea haunt has a lovely ambiance and that does make up for its lacklustre food"
May 2019,First Class,Stayed here with my husband over a long weekend. Beautiful hotel. Service and staff first class. Food delicious. Made to feel very special 😊. Nothing too much trouble. We stayed in a suite which was spacious and comfortable. Attention to detail fantastic 🙂
July 2019,Fabulous in every way,I’ve never felt the need to give a review before but this experience was too good not to share. The most perfect stay. Staff absolutely impeccable and attuned to every possible need. Best beds in London. Couldn’t fault in any way. Can’t wait to come back. 
November 2019,Best service,"Lovely hotel with greate service and lovely rooms. I did not try the spa or the gym. love the outpacking service included and the hotel car.  God beds, nice location, greate food, I have nothing bad to say about this FAB hotel. I will come back for sure.  "
October 2019,My new home in London,"London was my final stop on a trip that took me through New York, Geneva and Paris. Many years ago I had the good fortune of being invited for tea at Brown's by an English friend. After never quite getting the timing right, I finally returned to Brown's for High Tea and, as a special indulgence, to stay. From my arrival, through to the spa, my beautifully appointed room, High Tea, drinks in the Bar and breakfast in the room the following morning...my stay was superb. The staff was extremely attentive...using my name and providing me with an experience that has spoiled me for other mere hotels. A few highlights from my stay...(1) the best reflexology I have had outside of Bangkok Thailand...I wish it had lasted forever; (2) a High Tea and tea tasting curated by staff of the tea…"
October 2019,„One of these days“,"During my stay in London I spend a wonderful evening at the Donavan Bar. The drinks are amazing, I had a little bit trouble to choose - each cocktail is unique and has its own story. At the end I went with „Sparkling side of the moon“ an homage to Pink Floyd and it was just fabulous. Later in the evening I got a wonderful tour from the Duty Manager Claus B. He showed me different rooms and suites and explained all the history. „Thank you very much again, for the effort.“ It was just perfect!"
November 2019,Breakfast,"Good place for a quick business breakfast. Nice buffet spread, good service and nice hot order options. Able to get a quiet corner for a business conversation. Poached eggs with avacado toast was great"
November 2019,spot of tea !,Zoltan and Lorenzo took great care and it was a special first memory for traditional afternoon tea ! It was beyond delightful in every way service and taste superb ! It was a great way to start our London tour!
November 2019,Fabulous,"Just spent 4 days with family in  3 rooms, including one suite. Friendly & helpful staff, great location, fabulous bar. Amenities & minibar were nice. Lots of complimentary water. The decor of the first floor blew me away - Whimsical & beautiful! Most of all, the restaurant, Charlie’s, was just superb! Absolutely wonderful experience!"
November 2019,Afternoon tea,"My wife and I had a wonderful afternoon tea experience at Brown’s Hotel in London. We have had tea in many places all over the world, and today’s was one of, if not the best afternoon tea we’ve ever had. The Brown Hotel is a lovely historic building which made this experience so elegant. The staff were extremely friendly and very knowledgeable. Yonka and Zoltan made a very dynamic duo. They really knew the menu, and helped us decide which teas to try. The food was absolutely fantastic as well. We did not feel rushed, in fact we were encouraged by Yonka and Zoltan to take our time and savor our experience, which we indeed did. In fact, we loved everything so much that we made a reservation for December when we return to London with our family. If you’re looking to do afternoon…"
October 2019,Lunch in Charlie's,Gorgeous food and an amazing afternoon. The staff where amazing and so helpful relating to food intolerances.  I have had afternoon tea here before but first time for lunch it was a outstanding highly recommended by me. 
September 2019,Fabulous dinner at Charlie's,I was treated to dinner in Adam Byatt's restaurant Charlie's.  I eat out a lot and would put myself as difficult to please.  The experience was excellent - we had drinks in in the bar first a chilled club like environment before moving into Charlie's for dinner.  I had the monkfish which was beautifully cooked and full of flavour.  We asked the sommelier to reccomend the wine and he suggested a Gewurztraminer which was excellent.  Would certainly go again for a special night out. Perfect location near Picadilly too. 
October 2019,Finest Hotel in the world.  True 5 Stars.,"The Brown's experience is so personal, you often forget you are in a hotel.  There is not a square inch of this hotel that seems out of place.  The quality follows you around from element to element.  The reception is charming, personal and efficient, Rooms are almost always ready upon check in (ours has been and we fly overnight from New York).  The beds are outragousely comfortable.  You rarely see other guests there.  The restaurant and bar are so popular are often crowded but never did we have to wait for a table.  A dream experience.  We were brought fruit to our room everyday.  Brenda, the hotel operator would send us a pot of coffee every morning by request.  The doormen knew all the goings-on around town and we give us advice where to go and where to avoid(There were…"
October 2019,Business trip,I had the chance to experience a stay at Brown's hotel for business purpose and I can say that it is an Excellent hotel. The staff/concierge is very professional. The hotel has a very good location. I highly recommend this hotel.
October 2019,Excellent Service & Perfect Location,"Another very enjoyable stay at Browns.  This is our favourite hotel in London and perfectly located for shopping, art galleries and theatre.  The staff are extremely pleasant and helpful.  We love the stylish interiors and rooms with spacious bathrooms and the food including breakfast in the beautifully decorated restaurant is always excellent."
October 2019,"A beautiful, classy hotel, very good cocktail bar and restaurant","We dined there one evening. Excellent attentive service, very attractive Donovan cocktail bar and stylish restaurant. All three courses for dinner were excellent, the wine list is very good and fairly priced. A good choice for afternoon tea or any time. To be recommended if you like quality!"
October 2019,Best in London,"Feels like home in Mayfair, exceptional cozy boutique hotel. Super chic, great comfortable beds, fantastic service. My second stay and will definitely be back. Friendly staff, perfect service, amazing bar and restaurants off the lobby. Close enough to stores yet far enough away to feel residential. All around wonderful hotel. "
October 2019,Think Marriott - only better,"The service is impeccable, the hotel staff help wherever they can. The Hotel is clean, tidy and feels like home.  The room has everything you need (and more) and is so comfortable - I imagined Olga standing in there and thinking - ""what have we missed?"". The food was lovely, well thought out again and the position of the hotel is second to none. Will we go back? - Big yes to that"
October 2019,A very nice stay,"I have been coming to London since the mid sixties with my parents and now for over 35 years with my wife and kids and i don’t know how we could miss this gem?  The service has been above excellence in particular the concierge headed by David and his excellent team who take it personal interest in everything and will try till they are successful to get our request completed. (Lee you have been wonderful thank you).  Housekeeping, room service at times quite shocking with their very quick response and attention.   Donavan Bar is a fun place with attentive service.  Our six days stay has been not only comfortable but how can you complain about the location?  My wife and I want to thank the management for their hard work to run such a fine establishment and their attention to…"
October 2019,Great classic London Hotel,"A classic beautiful Mayfair Hotel. Excellent service and a very friendly staff. We stayed in a one bed room suite that was very nicely decorated, We had lunch at the bar - great food and a great venue for business meetings. We sure had an afternoon tea which is one of the best in London. "
October 2019,❤❤❤,cad is féidir liom a rá faoin óstán iontach seo? Mothaím go raibh mé i mo chroí le linn mo chuairte. Is é an bricfeasta bruite vegetarian ach delicious agus an fhoireann chomh deas agus gairmiúil. Bhí dúil mhór agam i mo sheomra! go raibh maith agat!
October 2019,Disappointing tea ,"Have been to Browns for afternoon tea many times in fact it’s one of our favourites. Today was very disappointing. Desultory service. Four tiny scones and small cakes for 3 Had to ask for more. One would have expected them to ask. Less than at the competition The only time there was attentive service was when they asked if we wanted more champagne- at a price of course.  Sad to be honest, we love the ambience and will go back in the hope this was a one off"
August 2019,Afternoon tea was divine ,"This would have to be one of my top afternoon tea’s. Tearoom had a smart but informal feel about it even though it was obviously a 5 star establishment  Front of house staff, two gentlemen were extremely attentive and accommodating. Mini open bagels were a nice change on the usual sandwiches, the fillings your tradition but with a twist. Patisserie’s were delicious, flavour and texture combinations amazing.   "
May 2019,Special celebration - wonderful afternoon tea,"This was a long awaited reunion for me and a dear American friend. We have kept in touch but not met for 35 years so it was a very special day. My husband and I wanted to give her a true London experience so Browns was the obvious choice. It has long been our favourite afternoon tea restaurant and they did not disappoint. The food was delicious with divine sandwiches and exquisite cakes. The menu has just been changed and the flavours are delivered with real thought and finesse.   The tea menu is extensive and Browns give you the opportunity to taste a few. Our 'tea sommelier' Yonka was fantastic. She kept us well fed and watered and was determined to make sure we had a great time. Service was wonderful, discreet, attentive and friendly. Yonka and Zoltan between them made the…"
February 2019,Quintessentially English,"I have been several times over the past year for drinks and to dine and every time the service is suoerb, staff wonderful, drinks and food lovely. The new bar is stunning but the one steadfastly unchanging aspect of this hotel is the service from the staff. As you might expect from a hotel of this calibre service is faultless. Once I forgot to bring my reading glasses and within minutes was presented with a pair (new) from a member of the bar staff. Frankly, this hotel is a home from home, welcoming and friendly. If you are in London at all then pop in if only to have a drink at their bar. Just off Piccadilly, hidden gem."
May 2019,Thank you Browns,"I appreciated all the quaint aspects of my stay, and whilst this is my first time in the last 10 years of staying in a hotel other than the Berkeley, Connaught or Claridges, I don’t feel that I lost out.   Thank you all for the kind attention that I received.  👍  "
April 2019,Best afternoon tea ever,"Our experience at Browns hotel tea room was simply wonderful. The food was delicious as well as the tea selection. We managed to get the best table, the one by the window and also the best waitress, Yonka. Her services was exceptional which made the whole experience even better. The atmosphere was cosy, ideal for a chilly afternoon and the piano music in the background, the cheery on cake!  Already looking forward to our next visit. Thank you Browns hotel for such a lovely afternoon."
April 2019,A bit like a B&B which is trying hard,"The restaurant and lounge etc. are really nicely done.  I had wanted to stay here for ages.  I was very sadly disappointed by the room - small, a bit run down and not that comfortable - all looked very much like a slightly tired B&B.  This is a shame since I've stayed in a few other Rocco Forte hotels and they've been good."
April 2019,A truly stunning experience ,"We have just floated home from a truly exceptional stay at Brown’s. The moment we arrived, John McLean and his team welcomed us to a beautiful home from home and it felt that helping me to celebrate my birthday was their only focus. Our suite was generous, beautifully decorated and very well equipped. The service was personal, attentive, friendly and discreet. From the extensive delicious cocktail list in Mr Calabrese’s bar to the exquisite food at Beck’s, no detail is too small and nothing is too much trouble. The atmosphere throughout was warm and welcoming and the seemingly effortless way that we were made to feel special made for a truly stunning experience. I cannot thank John and his team enough. We will definitely be back. "
March 2019,"Immaculate hotel, best nights sleep",What a great hotel! The Location in Mayfair is perfect for serious shoppers as a stones throw from Bond Street.  Staff are welcoming and delightful and nothing was to much trouble. It was my sons birthday and on our return we had a bottle of champagne and birthday cake placed in our room. These little touches just add to and enhance the experience.  The hotel itself is maintained to the highest level throughout and the beds are amazing. We have stayed there a couple of time now and will definitely be returning in the future.
April 2019,BEST customer service!,"Best customer service in London! I called to set up birthday gift for a friend staying there, and they went beyond my expectations and completely hassle free! And it was complimentary on their behalf! It’s a must stay! :) George-Hiley Jones made this possible!"
March 2019,Browns - Mayfair,We recently visited Browns for two nights to celebrate my sons birthday. Fabulous location and beautiful hotel. The staff couldn’t be more helpful and even provided a birthday cake and bottle of champagne to help us celebrate. Can’t wait to return
April 2019,The Fabulous Brown’s Hotel,"High Tea in the tea room was outstanding. The ambiance, champagne, sandwiches, scones and attention to detail are unsurpassed. The staff was so friendly and accommodating. I asked if I could see the Kipling Suite and they took me there! It was beautiful and amazing. I love the Brown’s Hotel! Stay there if you can."
October 2018,Agatha christie slept here.,"Brown's Hotel was portrayed by Christie as a somewhat dowdy and sinister establishment in AT BERTRAMS HOTEL. Today, it is, in fact, a wonderful townhouse hotel with a cheerful staff and a great new Italian restaurant ""Beck"". The Bar is busy and afternoon tea is also a big attraction. Some  rooms look out on a interior space but trouble has been taken to provide each window with a box of miniature shrubs. Its' location is superb and if you are really lucky, you might snag a lift in the house Bentley (i did)."
October 2018,Excellent,"We stayed at Brown's Hotel Mayfair for 3 nights last week. We were celebrating our Wedding Anniversary and my wife's birthday. Our room was spotlessly clean and the service was fantastic. The staff were very attentive and couldn't do enough for us. Breakfast was lovely with an extensive menu and buffet. The hotel is very central to all of London's top spots and within walking distance of the West End, Covent Garden and Piccadilly. We highly recommend Brown's Hotel."
December 2017,Wonderful !,My husband took me here for our anniversary as a treat and it was just wonderful.  The staff are very attentive and the rooms very relaxing and traditional.  It was the perfect base to explore the shops in the west end such as harrods and for visiting the theatre (Les Miserables was also great).  I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.
October 2018,Afternoon tea in style,"Six of us celebrated a friend's birthday here and we all were delighted with our choice.   A friendly greeting as we entered from a wet Albermarle Street and a glass of chilled blackcurrant tea was followed by a wonderful array of sandwiches, small buns etc with very interesting fillings and toppings. These were constantly replenished and likewise our wide variety of teas in gleaming indiviual pots were poured and refreshed without hesitation.  This was followed by a selection of interesting small pastries and warm scones with home-made jam and thick cream.  The service was faultless and very friendly and the elegant pianist added a wonderful background to our celebration.   Staying well beyond our allocated timed tea slot but at no time were we rushed and it could not have been…"
October 2018,"Historic Brown’s Hotel, Mayfield, London","Brown’s Hotel is elegant, comfortable and tastefully decorated. It is conveniently situated in the heart of London close to art galleries, museums, theatres, shops, restaurants, Royal Parks all within easy walking or running distance. Public and taxi transportationis also conveniently at hand.   The reception and service at Brown’s is always courteous and friendly and the restaurant is extremely good as is breakfast. Refer to their comprehensive website for details.   Brown’s is highly recommended not only because it has an illustrious past but the fact that it is provides a quiet, relaxing and comfortable experience for travellers.  This is especially important after a long haul flight."
October 2018,Afternoon tea,We went there a week ago and were served by 2 lovely gentlemen(Indian and Italian guys). They were very helpful and professional. We enjoyed the quite afternoon with a guy playing piano in the background. May be the tea selection could have been better but having said that it's a place one sud def visit.
October 2018,Afternoon tea,"I recently went for afternoon tea with my friend. The staffs are extremely friendly and helpful. Great atmosphere to be. I was served by Mr akshay, who is very friendly and welcoming. I am very happy with the service."
April 2018,Beautiful Hotel,We had a great time at the hotel really made us feel welcome and nothing was a problem. We request some fruit for our little two year old and they made sure we had fresh fruit in our room everyday for him. They also made a very cosy cot up for him and add baby toiletries in the bath for him too. The staff are beyond friendly and always go the extr mile for you. I will definitely be staying here again with my family next time I come to London.
October 2018,Beck at Browns- Beautiful restaurant,"We chose Beck at Browns for a 15+ family lunch gathering/ celebration and I cannot stress how highly organized and professional the staff were. They made sure all my requests were fulfilled, including my really last minute request of having place cards on the table. Our three course meal was succulent to the say the least and they have a really good selection of wine. Lastly the setting is just beautiful. I previously went to Brown's precedent great restaurant Hix, but Beck at Brown's elegant and traditional yet fresh and airy atmosphere made it the perfect setting for a family celebration. I highly recommend it."
June 2018,How special Brown's hotel is,"Every time I return to Brown's hotel, porters & a door man welcome me like their family always. One step out from the car, you are warm welcomed by some familiar faces, like John, Givi, Max & reception team. Brown's is the special place where you do not feel like staying at hotel. usually the process from arrival to check-in is like catching up with staff.. how you are, how we are etc.. etc.. As soon as entering the room, my preferences are well remembered and immediately feel like a home in London. It is really a precious jewel with history. Restaurant & Bar are lovely too."
August 2018,12 days and nights at Brown's hotel in Mayfair London.,"We have often stayed in London… But have never received service, food and all-round hospitality that we received at Brown's.  All concierges were exceptional but I must make special mention of David Young who went out of his way to make our holiday exceptional. There was no task too difficult,  no question that was not answered to our satisfaction. The reception desk, the restaurant staff all the amenities were first-rate. When next we visit London our first stop will be Brown's hotel in Mayfair.  We could not help but mention to our friends in Australia about Brown's, I am not exaggerating when I say London was made very special we felt like we were coming home each evening and even though all services were professional we felt like we were among family.  Bruce Sherlock Sydney…"
January 2019,Newly refurbished restaurant is lovely...,"Though it's been open for a bit, I just got back to London and had lunch in the restaurant.  It's a beautiful room with great wall paper and overall design.  The linen and the glassware are superb.  Lunch itself was pleasant and tasty and completely reasonable price wise.  The wine list is exceptionally impressive.  Separately - I've been to Brown for tea and it's one of the best in London.  everything from sandwiches to sweets and fruit.  Can't go wrong."
January 2019,Excellent stay this time at Brown’s,"After having had some issues last time we stayed at this property we decided to have another go. This time everything was perfect. We received a very nice welcome from Janine Mallia, front of house manager, and an excellent upgrade. Concierge did an excellent job booking restaurants, theatre etc for us. All in all we were very pleased. The only potential issue is that the breakfast room can sometimes be very full since many guests from outside come to the hotel for breakfast and business discussions. Luckily I am an early bird so I did have a nice table each morning before the crowds arrived. I also enjoyed the fitness room and my wife was very well taken care of in the Spa."
January 2019,Amazing service in a beautiful hotel!,"My partner and I were upgraded into a classic suite and it was gorgeous - imagine watching TV from your tub!  But what is more, the service was impeccable and the team were insanely kind!  They knew we were there to celebrate our birthdays and they went above and beyond to treat us and make our stay extra special and just amazing!  Thank you Brown's team... and mostly, thank you to Janine, the Hotel Manager, who was just incredibly attentive, caring, thoughtful and overall fabulous!"
January 2019,Favorite Part of Our Trip!,"My sister and I had the best time doing the afternoon tea at Brown’s Hotel. The food was of amazing quality and the decor was perfect. Our server Yonka made the experience incredible. Aside from being a pleasure to talk to, her knowledge of the afternoon tea was extremely impressive. We wish she could have sat down and joined us! We’re definitely bringing our grandma back from the US to visit the Brown’s Hotel and meet Yonka!"
January 2019,Best Tea in London,"The experience of afternoon tea in at Brown's is undoubtedly the best in London.  Highlight of our New Year's trip, and that's saying a lot.  Atmosphere is warm and welcoming.  Service is friendly and impeccable.  Quality of food and selection of teas top notch.  Recommend the Gold."
December 2018,Perfect for a night in London during the Christmas Season!,"We stayed the weekend just before Christmas and had a lovely stay with a very warm and friendly welcome from both the doorman and the receptionist when we checked-in.  There had been a mix-up with our booking, which had been made via a third party.  The e'mail stated breakfast was included in the room rate, but this wasn't the case.  This has happened on a previous occasion at another hotel when using this particular hotel booking website, resulting in a rather lengthy phone call to sort it out.  In this instance however the receptionist immediately offered complimentary breakfast with no fuss, to save us the hassle of trying to sort it out, which was very much appreciated. The bedroom was large, light and airy and the bathroom was huge for a central London hotel.    The hotel…"
December 2018,Graciousness beyond the norm.....,"We chose Brown's because of its reputation for being family friendly, and its location.  We were thrilled on both counts.  The staff and accommodations could not have been more gracious, and our teen-age granddaughters were delighted with our breakfasts and high tea.  At the end of a busy day of touring, coming back to Brown's truly felt like coming home.  Kudos to a diligent, professional and truly friendly staff and a beautifully updated historic hotel."
December 2018,Super stay,"Stayed in December for 3 nights in a classic corner suite.  Very much enjoyed our stay, Madga in reservations was excellent and really set the stay up to be lovely, which was very much appreciated as it was our 35th anniversary.  The suite was lovely, overlooking the street and the breakfast service in room was excellent both in terms of the quality of food and the service, especially on our last day when we had an early flight and asked for a continental breakfast at 4am - they came and set it up in the room, regardless of the very early time - quite exceptional.  We had asked for a quiet private room and they had really thought about our needs.  Housekeeping was also excellent - very clean and tidy, and very much enjoyed the bed linens and furnishing and design.  Bathroom was…"
December 2018,Remarkable,4th stay at the Brown’s hotel. That was not the best one but this is still a fantastic place to enjoy the Christmas period in London. The renovated Donovan Bar is great and Beck finally found his place. 
September 2018,Mary K,"My family organised a cream tea for a 70th Birthday surprise for my sister. We had great difficulty for finding a venue big enough for everyone until we came across Browns Hotel. Everything about the booking, which was mainly by email, was easy and when telephoning with questions the Staff were so helpful and pleasant. When arriving at Browns we were greated with a brilliant welcome and showed to our room, nothing was too much trouble. Upon the arrival of the afternoon tea the food, which was lovely, kept coming and the Staff were so pleasant and attentive were there for our every need but without being intrusive. Once finished, we left, very full but very happy with our experience. I would like to thank the Staff for their service, kindness and help in making this special day…"
September 2018,CEO CCG,Kudos to Givi the luggage porter at Browns hotel London. My colleague and I were there on business. I thought I had my act together leaving hotel. Givi asked me if I had my passport. Nooooo. Years of travel and it was at the bottom of my luggage. As I was rooting through the bag he noticed I’d left my new jacket. Whew. Thank you Givi and Browns...great hotel and staffed the way only the British do!
September 2018,Lovely Hotel with a couple of niggles,"Stayed at Browns for the first time after my partner booked a four night break . The hotel is the oldest in London and we found it very welcoming , however there were a few areas which could be improved . We had booked an executive room which was very disappointing- the view was a wall a few feet from the window which made the room very dark and depressing . It was so dull that we paid for an upgrade to a deluxe room which was lovely and bright although perhaps needed some updating eg lamp shades loose , lamps not working , skirting scuffed . We had asked for tea & coffee facilities to be provided but this had not been supplied so we had to ask again - a little niggle but annoying . This tray was not maintained throughout our stay ie cups not washed , tea bags and milk  not…"
August 2018,THE BEST HOTEL,"This Hotel is perfection in all respects. On our trip we stayed in the finest hotels in the United Kingdom....the Brown was our last before returning to the U.S. On arrival they upgraded us to an amazing suite as a present from them for our anniversary. This oldest hotel in London has the most modern amenities and, by far, the best service anywhere. I think someone might have gotten fired if we had to even open a door for ourselves. Wonderful hotel with wonderful staff, excellent location and great food. We hated to leave there. We will be at Browns on any trip we make to London in the future."
September 2018,The true British Experience ,"What a wonderful luxury hotel ! Even before we arrived the reservation was amazing. We mentioned we will probably go to a show and the Lady who took our reservation sent us a few links with the most recent shows in London and offer her assistance to book the tickets for us.  When we arrived the doorman welcome us so well, we didn't even had to think of our luggages that he already took us to the reception desk where the receptionist did our check in. We were met by the french General Manager who remembered us from our previous stay and welcome us back. The amenities in our room were lovely and we even had a bag of snacks ready with a handwritten card wishing us a good day out... A day of Shopping which my husband wasn't excited about. till we found in the bag the address of a…"
August 2018,I will be back very soon,"What an amazing Hotel ,  the staff are so friendly and attentive ,  no request is to difficult and really do put their best foot forward.  The rooms were larger than expected as we all know most hotels in London do have a big space problem, and the bed was incredibly comfy to sleep in.  I do not usually put comments up on trip adviser but for exceptional service I think it is important to say well done when things are done right.  Will definitely choose here again for my next special occasion."
September 2018,Very Well Located,"An older hotel with some physical shortcomings, Brown’s seems to cater mostly to upper-class British clients who have been coming for years, if not generations.  The staff are well-trained, warm, and helpful. Practically hundreds of restaurants and high-end shops are within a 5-10 minute walk, as are major tourist draws like Piccadilly Circus, Regent St., Green Park, Hyde Park, the Burlington Arcade, others.  Notable deficiencies were a lack of coffee-making facilities, poorly-designed bathroom (constrained by the old structure), and really poor, overpriced breakfast at Beck’s, which serves as their coffee shop."
August 2018,Home Away from home!,"Brown’s Hotel is just right.  Not too large, not too small.  The rooms are large and decorated with lovely little pops of colour, the bathrooms are spacious and the restaurant and bar are both AMAZING.  Great location, right next to all of the high end shops on Old Bond and New Bond Streets, not far from Soho or Green Park, and an easy walk to Westminster to check off any touristy sites on your list.  I travel a LOT, so staff and service is of the utmost importance.  Brown’s has nailed both.  Everyone is spot on from the cdoorman (who celebrates his birthday today!), to the front desk staff who always have smiles, to the servers in the restaurant and in the Donovan Bar who are attentive, yet not overbearing.  When I checked in on Saturday, my room wasn’t yet ready, so I went to…"
August 2018,JOHN VLASSOPOLOS,"The Browns hotel is perfectly located in Mayfair London in close proximity to all the museums and great restaurants, theatre district and main street shopping of Bond and Oxford St , with all high end boutique stores including Selfridges The rooms were excellent and the concierge and staff at Browns hotel The in house Italian restaurant was of exceptionally high quality and standard and highly recommended."
August 2018,Perfectly lovely,"My new favorite spot in London. I have nothing even remotely negative to say. The room was beautiful and spotless, the staff attentive, and the services exceptional. The location could not be beat. Walking distance everywhere."
August 2018,Exceptional hotel!,"We recently stayed at Brown's and can't say enough about our experience there. The location, the service, the dining options [including breakfast, dinner, high tea, and the bar], and the rooms were all top notch. All the staff were responsive, attentive, willing to help and bent over backwards to make our visit exceptional. We highly recommend Brown's."
August 2018,Great stay,"A lovely weekend stay at Browns. Service was fantastic and we were made to feel very welcome. Also a thank you to Max, Chris and Roy for supplying our umbrella’s when we were checking out in the pouring rain."
August 2018,Such a nice surprise!,"We have just spent a beautiful weekend at Browns. It was our first time there and everything was simply perfect: the room, quite, elegant and very confortable, the facilities and, moreover, the high level of service. The staff is kind, gentle, very professional without beeing too formal. When you get in, the entrance, certainly stylish, doesn’t reflect the overall excellent standard of the rest of the property but shortly you can discover the beautiful lunchroom of Beck’s restaurant and the sophisticated atmosphere of the Bar. We were used to stay in other hotels in Mayfair but we will be back at Browns! Piero and Annalisa Longo"
July 2018,perfect english spot,"Brown's is the perfect hotel for an english immersion. Great location, kind service, good tips on where and what to do, comfortable and quiet rooms, wonderful bar, and great food. A must for afternoon tea!"
June 2018,Customer Service Excellence,"One of my favourite London Hotels. You are always made to feel welcome, the staff are friendly and professional without being intrusive. The accommodation is of an exceptionally high standard and dining is a real experience for the seasoned foodie."
August 2018,Location and Service at it's finest!,"It had been many years since I last stepped foot into Brown's Hotel, and I was a little reluctant about our very recent stay.  After our recent family vacation, we all concurred that Brown's is one of the finest gems anywhere in the world!  Location is as good as it gets.  Centrally located, everything that we wanted to do was close by.  The rooms were blended traditional elegance with modern comfort; and were quite large by European standards.  The restaurants and bars are absolutely gorgeous, and my girls loved traditional tea time.  With all that said, the people at Brown's are as professional and hospitable as we have ever found at other very fine hotels around the world.  Their 24 hour concierge service was at our service around the clock. We look forward to staying at…"
July 2018,Wonderful Personable Hotel in the heart of London,"This was our first stay at Browns and it really did not disappoint. My wife and I love the Rocco Forte brand and had stayed often at the old Manchester property and the Mayfair located hotel was on our list. The promise of good weather, a break from the schedule and a family Birthday presented an ideal opportunity for a city mini break.  The service experience actually started at the time of booking where an incredibly helpful and obliging Paris tailored the Two rooms that we needed exactly to our needs and also to our budget by way of offering excellent value. Immediately after the booking was confirmed came the introduction and offer of assistance from the hotel Concierge team. A special mention must go to Paul who worked really hard to offer help and advice on visits and…"
July 2018,"Great location, Professional Staff","The hotel is a true classic.  It is one of the oldest hotels in London. It is in a great location in the heart of the luxurious shopping district of London and very close to the Green Park metro station.  I'm a fan of Rocco Forte Hotels chain and really love the professionalism of hotel staff as well as condition of their hotels.  When you're in one of their hotels, you know that you'll be staying in beautiful, clean and spacious rooms with great bathrooms with good amenities.  Always a beautiful bar, great breakfast and professional staff.  However, this time our bathroom had a maintenance problem.  Moreover, it was really uncomfortable to use the bathroom where its window only had a see-through linen curtain.  I hope we were not seen by people across the  building as we were…"
July 2018,Very fine hotel in the center of London,"This is a really nice hotel.  There's a doorman to greet you and hail a cab and inside it is beautifully decorated in an elegant, European style.  The lounge and tea room are beautiful and a piano player on weekend creates a nice atmosphere.  The breakfast service is very good and the staff are very professional and attentive.  The rooms are nicely appointed and ours had a very good sized bathroom. The only downside is the awful traffic in London.  It is great to be centrally located but awful when it takes 30 minutes to get on to Piccadilly to actually begin a journey. Much easier to walk two blocks to the underground station at Green Park."
July 2018,Hidden gem,"I've seen a lot of (very) good hotels in London, but this one is definitely my favourite. It's located just behind Bond Street, yet in a rather quiet street (be it with good bars and restaurants very near), so you have all of the advantages of the city centre, without the noise. The room was excellent and so was the service: truly what you can hope a 5* hotel to deliver. Nice and clean rooms, helpful and friendly staff, and a very chique and trendy yet classic interior. The only minor commentary I can give is that our suite had views over the courtyard, which was not bad, but not very exciting either. But aside from that: a wonderful experience. I'll definitely stay here again!"
June 2018,My Birthday Stay and Afternoon Tea,"After coming back here to visit the Hix Mayfair back in 2013, for my Grandads Birthday. I decided to return for my own Birthday and actually stay. We arrived last night( the night before on the 10th June) my birthday which was today the 12th, where the staff on duty was very accommodating, from the receptionist on duty to Matio at the concierge Desk, we was quickly shown to our room. We then ordered room service withing 20 minutes the room service waiters quickly delivered our food, and was very attentive and showed us everything we ordered. The room was very beautiful it was a large room which was so cosy. The Bed was rather comfortable and the pillows was nice and fluffy, our room was extremely clean.  We ordered room service breakfast and again the 2 waiters who delivered our…"
June 2018,Top Notch Service!,"I was only in town for one night and decided to stay at the Brown's by recommendation of a colleague.  It is in a great part of town where you can spend the day to SHOP or visit a few pubs!  There was also an art museum that stayed open late.  Once I arrived, I was greeted like royalty from the doorman to greet you with a smile and by name, to the front desk that greets you with another welcoming presence and morning coffee.  I even ate the best gnocchi as a late night meal from my jetlag.  I had a minor change to the dish and the chef was more than accommodating to my request, it was delicious. I wish I had more time to explore your property and experience more of your hospitality!  Thank you!"
May 2018,Truly special,What a fabulous experience. We absolutely loved your hotel in London. It is perfectly located. The entire staff was so helpful and accommodating. They were especially kind and considerate to my elderly mother. Becks was a fabulous find!  Our suite was lovely and comfortable. Our stay was truly a delight.
May 2018,Home away from home,"This is an excellent hotel for an extended stay. The staff are professional and welcoming. After long days exploring London I was able to relax in the Donovan's Bar or Beck Restaurant. The Afternoon Tea was beautiful. Any issues brought to the attention of the staff are quickly dealt with and resolved. The room is comfortable and quiet, allowing for a restful sleep. The location allows easy access to public transportation and the Hotel Car is available for short trips nearby. I would gladly return to Brown's Hotel."
May 2018,Amazing stay!,"We stayed for one night in a standard room. Nothing ""standard"" about it. It was larger and more exclusive than any standard room we have stayed in. The ""turn down"" service made us feel special and taken well care of. It all started with the warm welcome in the reception and by the consierge. Since it was a birthday celabration we decided to have Lunch, tea and dinner at the hotel. The staff in both the restaurant and in the tea-room were service-Minded and the chef even turned up at dinner to ask if everything was at our satisfaction."
June 2018,Birthday Celebration @ Beck's,"We had an outstanding meal for my birthday celebration at Browns Hotel. The food in Beck's @ Browns is fabulous, excellence in quality, brilliant menu and five star service. We had the Octopus Salad, Pan fried Veal Sweet breads followed by the best pasta in London and Beck’s signature affogato tiramisu and hazelnut planet, pure class and indulgence matched with brilliant table service - Becks @ Browns will not disappoint!"
June 2018,Pre dinner drinks in Donovan Bar,"I had pre dinner drinks in Donovan Bar. It was my first visit after the refurbishment. What a transformation! Loved light coming through the windows, cooler scheme which seamlessly brings you into good old glitz and glam of London night life. I had Lavender me, nonalcoholic cocktail. Sooooo nice!!! Lovely selection of nonalcoholic cocktails. Definitely coming back!"
May 2018,Spa birthday treat ,"My daughter chose this venue for her 19th birthday treat - her first spa experience has set the bar very high indeed. The team was wonderful- incredibly kind and welcoming, lovely treatments and a surprise birthday cake from them really made the day extra special. Thank you all x"
May 2018,Very Special,"We booked this hotel to celebrate our Silver Wedding Anniversary. On arrival we were asked if we were celebrating anything special and when we told them they upgraded us to a suite, which was incredibly spacious and comfortable. It was a great start and made us feel really special. We had lunch in Donovan's bar, the food and service were impeccable and the surroundings comfortable and interesting. When we arrived back later in the evening our bed had been covered in rose petals! The attentiveness of staff at Browns helped to mitigate the disappointment of our dinner at Le Gavroche. There was a fantastic choice at breakfast and there was no drama about us being a little late. All the staff we encountered were friendly and very professional. This was an outstanding stay and we…"
April 2018,Fantastic hotel!,"Fantastic  hotel  with outstanding staff, who just couldn't  do enough  to help us and make us feel  comfortable. The rooms were  lovely and the food was decadent, we had a perfect anniversary stay, and wouldn't  hesitate to return.  The location is great too."
April 2018,great in every way,"the browns hotel is great in every way: location, rooms, bar, restaurant and gym. we have stayed there more than 5 times for london weekend trips. Staff deserves special mention - very attentive and polite."
April 2018,Amazing hotel !!!!,We have stayed in Brown’s for my partners birthday. I have booked this as surprised and we loved every moment of our stay. Staff was friendly and accommodating all last minute request. Room was clean and top condition.  And the Dinner in restaurants was top class. Will recommend this hotel to everyone.  We will definitely be back thank you all for amazing stay. 
May 2018,A London treasure.,"Browns hotel is the oldest hotel in London and retains many original features coupled beautifully with some contemporary features. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Our room was spacious , immaculate and very comfortable. The Donovan Bar was the perfect place for a pre dinner cocktail. We had an amazing stay."
April 2018,For business with pleasure!,"My wife and I recently stayed here for a meeting at the QE II conference center. I chose it for the recommendations and location. It was a 20 min walk to the conference, much of it through the park. A metro station was one block away. From the minute the doorman greeted my wife and I, the experience was superb. All of the staff, doormen, registration, concierge staff, and restaurant staff made sure our experience was great. They made me feel like I was the most important guest they had. There were a lot of business people staying there, so suits and jackets were common in the restaurant and bar, but casual was also welcome. My wife was taken care of by the staff while I was in meetings. Our room was comfortable and room service excellent. When a tour they recommended was not…"
April 2018,An experience,"It was something I think, one should do, just once....have an English high tea at TheEnglish Tea Room at Brown's, the hotel where 'it all started'.... Thus it was with great anticipation, that my companions and I gathered for our high tea at Brown's. We did enjoy our outing; the welcome was warm, and the service efficient and professionally friendly. Four of us had the Traditional Afternoon Tea, while one opted for the Tea-Tox Menu. There was ample food to go around (tasty too) and the service staff was conscientious in asking if we wanted further servings. The atmosphere was comfy and just as it should be... (I am assuming that most people go to tea at Brown's because well, it *is* Brown's..) and my companions and I enjoyed our afternoon there.  It is quite pricey, but if you…"
April 2018,"Breakfast, fantastic","I went to have breakfast with a client and we both loooooved our time there. Eggs were perfectly cooked, my croissant was delicious. Very elegant, staff absolutely perfect, too. I will go back soon and I would recomment to anyone."
April 2018,Spacious and elegant rooms; great location,"Our new favorite in London! We have never stayed this close to Piccadilly, Regent Street and Bond Street. This old style traditional British hotel feels like it's family operated; the doormen and receptionists know your name after one day and you feel really looked after. The breakfast restaurant is cozy and comfortable both in size and style; the food served is between good and great (haven't tried the evening restaurant, which seems to have a great reputation for exquisite Italian food). We loved our (Deluxe) rooms which were very spacious with lots of cupboard room and a big bathroom. This hotel deserves to be up there with the best in London."
April 2018,Very Friendly,"We stayed here over the marathon weekend as the hotel we usually stay in was full and we were dining with friends nearby. I think this will now become our go to hotel, very friendly staff great you with a smile, the hotel it's self is beautiful and the rooms , clean comfortable and well equipped, except that is for tea making facilities (my usual gripe). Had cocktails in the bar, a good choice , around £20 each unless you want one of the very special ones (nearly died  at some of the prices, but dont think anyone ever has a cocktail over 5 grand). Good atmosphere. We didnt eat there as we were out that evening an  left very early the next day...maybe next time."
April 2018,Amazing!,"I stayed at Brown's for the first time recently and it has quickly become one of my favourite hotels to stay in on my visits to London. I dined in their restaurant one night which I believe had just opened and I have only one word to describe it - incredible! The food was delicious and the staff were so welcoming, I'm already looking forward to my next stay!"
April 2018,all time my favorite!,"We had stayed 2 nights and a afternoon tea at their traditional tea room. They provided us professional, warm and sicere service through out our stay. Especially all the staffs at concierge desk are very professional and replied promptly to our requests all the time and we had such a lovely time there. Also their afternoon tea is the best in London. I have had afternoon tea at Ritz, Capital Hotel, and many other famous hotels in London, but the afternoon tea at Browns is the best!"
April 2018,A true British luxury hotel,"We stayed here for our first weekend without kids for many years. The experience was excellent for both me and my wife. The hotel's location is just perfect with walking distance to all you need on a couples weekend getaway. The staff were great and we really enjoyed the room, the restaurant, SPA and everything else this 5 star boutique hotel has to offer"
April 2018,T. Boyer,"A friend and I stayed at Brown’s for six nights last week to celebrate a milestone birthday. We had a fabulous experience - a lovely, spacious room; excellent service all around; a staff that responded quickly and graciously to all of our inquiries and requests; a location that, while on a quiet street, is close to the action in Soho and within walking distance to almost everything we did throughout our visit. We happily returned to the tranquility of the hotel at the end of our busy day - a calm in the storm that is London - to enjoy a glass of wine in the bar before turning in.  We will be back again!!!"
May 2017,Yes.,"I stayed a week here. It was an incredible experience that I will never forget and definitely my favourite London hotel experience by far. There is nothing quite like a boutique hotel, especially Brown's."
April 2018,"“Excellent environment, friendly service, great menu choices and really brillant food and affordable prices''","we had an awesome lunch experience at Browns Hotel with a very professional stuff in a  bohemian atmosphere. The starters were amazing, burrata with marinated courgette and dressed crab with grilled Roman lettuce. Since I'm an Italian pasta lover I ordered house- made Spaghetti al ''cacio e pepe'' with peccorino cheese on lime- marinated langouistines I felt like beeing in Rome, pasta sky on earth, very tasty-  a must try!        My friend has been very exited about the pea soup with fresh mint and quinoa, fantasticly bright, light with a great balance. As well the red mullet sandwich has been delicious.  “Just a quick thank you for the hospitality and excellent food we had when we visited yesterday. We will certainly be returning in the near future.“"
April 2018,Barnaby Warboys,"The best that London has to offer!  The location is excellent - near Bond Street, Piccadilly, the Royal Academy, and a walkable distance to the National Gallery and National Portrait Gallery, the Mall, the Palace and Green Park"
April 2018,An Oasis of calm in a busy City,"An exceptional hotel. Rooms and décor are immaculate as you would expect in a hotel of this quality.  What really makes Brown's stand apart however is its staff.  They are personal, helpful and caring.  Its clear they take great pride in their job.  The staff not only ask how your day was but remember your answers and take an interest when they see you again. Cookies with the children's names on supplied as a surprise after a busy day. A concierge that can organise almost anything. Its all in the detail and at Browns there's lots of detail.   As an example my six you old son picked up a sickness bug whilst we were in London from the tube or another public place.  On returning to Browns that evening with him in my arms we had everything we needed within 2 mins of returning. …"
April 2018,Wonderful stay at London's finest hotel,"Great location in the heart of Mayfair. Attention to detail, great staff and service. A lovely room with a view. We felt pampered our entire stay. Concierge made every reservation we requested. Afternoon tea is a must. Highly recommend"
April 2018,Perfection. ,"Not one thing to fault. True perfection. We spent 3 nights with two children in two interconnecting rooms. The rooms were stylish, welcoming, impeccably cleaned with fantastic walk-in wardrobes and modern bathrooms. Service was always truly professional and totally genuine. We were made to feel at home and we relaxed straight away. A perfect 5 star hotel that welcomes families and indeed caters for them with such wonderful touches, children themed bedding with a teddy bear for each child, children toiletries in the bathroom, small slippers and dressing gowns, children’s magazines and even welcome cookies in the room with their names iced upon. The children’s private tour of London was not to be missed and  something they shall remember forever. The hotel restaurant was…"
March 2018,Special Occasion,"This was the second time that we have been fortunate to stay at Brown’s,  an iconic hotel and a superb experience. All of the hotel staff were extremely professional and friendly and our suite was simply divine. I would not hesitate to recommend the hotel to anyone and it could only be described as perfect."
March 2018,Brooks Investment Presentation,"I was invited to this property investment presentation in this hotel.  It was a small and personal presentation in a room on the first floor.  I was impressed with the Ruinart champagne that was served. It was that impressive I didnt need to try the red wine. We were treated to some quality canapes and the service was A1.  By the way, the presentation was interesting to the point where I had committed to invest.  I noticed there was a nice bar called Donovan donwstairs. I look forward to trying and reviewing."
August 2017,A Lovely Stay Indeed......,"I can not say one negative thing about this hotel.  From the accommodations to the attentiveness of the Concierge Team, the Browns Hotel is definitely a cut above the rest.  I would highly recommend this hotel if you are in London.         "
August 2017,Perfect Location !,Nice Rocco Forte Hotel with a very British feeling... the restaurant and the tiny bar are nice. Very mature and professional concierge ! But the location it's jus perfect right in the heart of Mayfair. Walking distance to great restaurants and upscale shopping !!
August 2017,Luxury in London,"We spent five nights at Brown's this summer.  We cannot imagine a better experience -- everything was perfect.  The accommodations were luxurious with every detail thought of, and the service was top-notch.  The hotel is also in an unbeatable location.   While Brown's also serves business travelers, we found it incredibly family-friendly.  Our son (aged 7) received his own child-sized bathrobe and a set of toys to entertain him in the room.  The restaurant staff looked out for him at breakfast - making sure he got all of his favorites from the buffet.  The concierge and other staff were thoughtful and attentive.  They helped us arrange a tour and gave us good restaurant recommendations and directions for getting around the city.  Our room was large and luxurious.  The beds and…"
July 2017,Glorious Four Days,"We stayed at the Brown's Hotel in fashionable Mayfair in mid-July. We were assigned to a lovely and spacious suite. We had a nice bedroom, lovely living room and very nice bathroom with a great shower. We had breakfast included in our rate . The breakfast was excellent and our server, Dominick was charming and very responsive. The concierges we worked with, David Young and Matteo Biondi were simply outstanding. Their restaurant recommendations were spot on and they got us fabulous seats for the outstanding award winning play Ferryman for significantly less money than I was quoted on the internet secondary ticket market sites. The hotel location in Mayfair is wonderful. Very near the theater district and historical parts of London and wonderful access to the tube. Also, it's…"
May 2017,Fantastic Hotel in London,"The past few times in London, I have stayed at this fantastic property.  It is located in Mayfair in a very safe neighborhood, very central to everything,  Hyde Park is a 10 minute walk, Bond street for shopping is a 5 minute walk, Selfridges on Oxford street is 20 minutes away and the best bar in the world and probably the most expensive is at The Connaught just off Berkely Square, which is a great neighborhood as well, is a quick 10 minute walk away. One of my favorite streets is Jermyn street, it is a 5 minute walk away as well.  We always stay in a Deluxe Suite, big enough for the two of us for about a weeks times.  They just had a remodel and the rooms are nicer than before.  The service here is great, everyone treats us really well and they do whatever you want very…"
August 2017,A first class British Hotel,"What an enjoyable time in London. Our hotel was very much a part of our enjoyment.. excellent service, first class faculty and a great location. The staff was very attentive and went out of their way to take care of our every request. We will be back."
August 2017,MY ABSOLUTE FAVOURITE,"Browns is the oldest hotel in London but you wouldn't know it. Everything is perfect and every need is catered for. The staff are absolutely amazing and so helpful. The beds and pillows so comfortable. Rooms are light and spacious. There is not one more thing I could wish for here. It's delightful and charming and perfect. Placed just off Old Bond Street it is right in the heart of the shops and restaurants .this hotel would be my pick every time I am in London, it's like coming home"
August 2017,Afternoon tea delight,"Had a lovely afternoon tea at Browns Hotel in Mayfair. Lovely setting and great service. Tea itself was very good, but not quite as sumptuous as the ones we have had at Claridges and The Savoy. Nice piano playing as well but my wife thought it could have been a bit too loud if we were sitting next to it. Perhaps she is right but I thought it was fine. However, overall it was a very pleasant afternoon in a relaxed setting. My only criticism was the seats were corner sofas so didn't really support you very well which meant you couldn't sit back in them, and you had lean forward to the table."
April 2017,The best,One of the finest and the best hotel to stay in London located in Mayfair with beautifully done rooms huge in size walking distance to many attractions including palace and park in centre of shipping district and amazing restaurants the staff here was very helpful and helpful will for sure stay here again 
March 2017,"Dinner with friends in a great hotel, fabulous location","Some friends and I decided to share a late meal after attending an opening event in Mayfair.   We had no reservation, so decided on Brown's as it's very relaxed whilst keeping its 5 star setting and standards. Dinner was great with really good food, timely and attentive service. A little pricy, but you get what you pay for. I'd really recommend this gorgeous hotel in the heart of Mayfair."
February 2017,My London Love,I love this hotel. My boyfriend is in London very often and sometimes I´m lucky enough to join him :-) The Browns is like our second home. Always feel welcome and it`s some kind of familiar. The location/ neighbourhood is lovely Mayfair. Very posh and just a scroll from Oxford Street / Bond Street for shopping. The rooms are lovely and very high end and there`s nothing the staff wouldn`t do to make their guests feeling comfortable and this in a very gentle and decent way. There are other high class hotels in London where the staff is really pushy but not at the Browns. Very professional. Thank you for being so lovely.
April 2017,On arrival  immediately felt like returning friends,"We arrived in the freezing London rain worn out from several days of travel. Immediately we felt like returning friends with the warm welcome from  the staff. All the staff were courteous and attentive without being intrusive. The rooms were large, clean and beautifully prepared.  Thanks for a welcoming stay."
May 2017,Barrister,"First rate in all respects - facilities, staff, service, food, and location. John the Doorman is a delight - the best professional I have ever encountered in that job in all my travels! I would give Brown's 10 stars..."
May 2017,Disappointed. Did not meet expectations.,"Check in Nothing special.  No welcome drink or personalized seated check in.  Did receive upgraded room as booked through FHR.   Room Junior Suite on 5th floor.  Large room, comfy bed/linens, although 2 singles pushed together, so ridge in middle.  Room needed upgrade. Stains on carpet; bathroom old with shower over bath; AC unit very loud and not very effective.  No view.  No iron/ironing board in room. Had to request. Had to request hairdryer. Would like more complimentary water. Did receive welcome chocolates and fruit.  Housekeeping Was impressed with housekeeping. Generally very good.  Only comment is that on night 2 they didn't do turn down until 9.30pm (after saying they'd do it at 8pm), which meant we were in the room at the time  Afternoon tea Pleasant but slow service.…"
April 2017,hospitality,"Very warm hospitality in the room, at reception, at concierge,transport driver,at restaurant and door men. Everybody works smartly and carefully. Very good access to Barlington arcade and Jermin street which are our favourite places."
April 2017,Mayfair gem,"Stayed at the Brown's hotel a few times and love it. Great hotel. great hospitality, great location, Indian restaurant across street was fantastic. Love staying here. Great location, easy access to the tube."
November 2016,Afternoon Tea,I ended up booking Browns for afternoon tea as Claridges was full so I wasn't sure what to expect. I contacted beforehand to explain I had a nut allergy and that my mum doesnt eat meat or eggs or cheese  (a tricky combination of people). We areived 20 minutes early which enabled us to grab the seats next to the open fire which was exquisite. The staff were SO friendly and helpful. The setting was beautiful and the chef had created sandwiches and cakes especially for our dietry requirements. Highly recommend it here!!
April 2017,Grand Dame still (again) in great form,"Splendidly refurbished, this older, charming hotel still competes at high level. exceptional service, great location, and quintessential British charm. Home of the iconic afternoon tea experience. Concierges know the insider tricks of navigating London"
April 2017,One of the best London hotels by far,"Fantastic hotel in one of the best locations to explore London. Spacious and comfortable rooms and very family friendly, Staff were attentive and helpful at all times and the gifts for the kids were a lovely extra touch. HIX restaurant thoroughly recommended although we did not have time for the afternoon tea this time round.. Great hotel.. Many thanks for making us feel so much at home.  "
April 2017,London Weekend,Fabulous hotel in an excellent location. Staff truly wonderful..... so helpful and polite. Donovan bar superb.... invited 16 friends to join us for drinks and it was a perfect place to meet and have pre dinner drinks
July 2017,Afternoon tea - what could be better,"There is nothing I can say to augment a review.  As a global traveler and having lived in England for 3 years,  Browns is an English classic.  Sophisticated service, makes a significant difference.   Prepare to skip dinner."
June 2017,Classic hotel in the middle of London,This is one of the oldest hotels in London  The building looks small but has a very claasic look from inside. The rooms are modern and very clean.  The lobby restaurant is wonderful and has a nice breakfast.  I recommend this hotel if you want to be near Mayfair and Regent Street with quick access to Picadilly. The area around the hotel is classic london.  Very corteous service.
October 2016,"good location, elegant room and pleasant breakfast","good location in the middle of mayfair, but still in a quiet area, so no cirkus around at night. elegant and contemporary room, with an excellent room service even late at night if you might have partied late in the early morning; excellent breakfast with an dedicated team."
July 2017,Bloody Mary masterclass,This was a Sunday treat from my wife with some friends..... Had the bar to our selves 4 of us and 2 cocktail waiters could not have been a better pre lunch experience interesting canapés learnt this history of Bloody Mary's and the opportunity to be the business side was an amazing experience
November 2016,The mark of a top class hotel during stressful time,"THis hotel has all one would expect of a classic London property with 5 star reputation.  However during my stay I had a crisis issue involving stolen luggage and travel documents in London City. The way the hotel assisted me, went out of their way to help and get things done in terms of resolving all the issues involved when something like this happens, is the mark of a true top quality "" home away from home"" that I would expect and require when in need.  Cannot speak more highly of all staff involved"
May 2017,My favourite hotel in London,"May was my 5th visit in just over a year and every time the standards are always the same - exquisite.  The team are all on point, the restaurant wether for breakfast or Dinner is excellent and the tea room is just divine and particularly good if you are having a small discreet meeting   My recommendation is if it matches your budget then don't hesitate to try it out   "
July 2017,Afternoon Tea,"Just tucking into afternoon tea on a Sunday.  Just a delight. Sumptuous surroundings, relaxed with touch of formality, wonderfully attentive staff, exceptional food, and a top drawer range of teas. Seek it out. Worth every penny."
July 2017,3 day stop over,"Excellent hotel. Breakfast was a dream of selections, coffee very good. Room very good a little crowed with furniture but most comfortable. Location you can't beat it right in the middle of down town Lisbon. All staff most friendly and very helpful."
June 2017,Afternoon high tea with champagne ,"I went here on the recommendation of DKs top 10 London because of the high ratings and it being the first hotel in London so I was able to be a part of history also.  The tea was lovely, I could have as much as I wanted and could have stayed as long as I liked.  Champagne was only one glass though.  Food was very rich and was no able to eat everything I was served.  The dining area is used for tea exclusively and felt like my cosy family room at home.  A fantastic experience and well worth the price tag."
June 2017,"Great location, excellent customer service but room was just average",With the Bown's hotel you may be sure that the service will be always perfect. The location is also really good as is the atmosphere.  But my room will not remain unforgettable due to its low ceiling and limited space...check before booking...
August 2017,Fine dinner experience in Hix Mayfair,Friendly welcome and efficient service. Relaxed atmosphere in Hix restaurant followed by a delicious meal chosen from a menu with a mouth watering choice of fine foods. Overall a most enjoyable evening helped by excellent service.
August 2017,Excellent supper,"Excellent supper in Hix, hugely helpful waiters and staff, who made you feel welcome the moment you walk in. I would recommend the prawn cocktail and sea trout.  I will be coming back again with friends, thank you for a memorable evening."
August 2017,Fantastic Hotel,"great service, fantastic room, great food from room service and the restaurant  and right  in the middle of the city overall a great experience and fantastic/helpful staff would definitely come back. ☺☺☺"
August 2017,Mixing business with vacation,"My family and I recently stayed at this hotel.  I was in London on business and my family joined me to tour London.  You cannot choose a better hotel for service, accommodations, and location.  From the Doorman to the concierge to housekeeping to the rest of the staff, the people were friendly, and insightful in helping my family have a great experience in London.  Highly recommend."
July 2017,"Wonderful Staff, Wonderful Location...You will want to stay here when you're in London",What a wonderful experience my daughter and I had at Brown's Hotel. This was my daughter's first visit to London so we were out and about playing tourist. The hotel is conveniently located to many tourist attractions and shopping. The concierge and porter were very helpful in recommending places to visit. The high afternoon tea was amazing! and HIX Mayfair was wonderful!  We are looking forward to going back soon. 
July 2017,Crew,"The crew is excepcional all the times in all places. Te concierge crew are outstanding finding what ever you are looking for, no matter the difficulty. The Browns locattion y very good, near tube, theatre and important city points."
July 2017,Excellent,"Very charming place, and our primary London choice since many years. Charming and exclusive without being stuffy or arrogant. Nice atmosphere. Very cosy bar. Rooms are not large, but all you need is there. We stayed in a junior suite, and that gives you that bit of extra space - recommended. The location is wonderful, and you can walk to Bond Street, St. James, Oxford Street, Regent Street."
July 2017,Baby Shower,"I was ringing around different hotels regarding a tour around London whilst we stay! The telephone Operator Brenda was very professional and friendly which is very hard to get nowadays. She was very patient as I really wasn't sure what to ask for, she suggested I be put through to concierge who was very helpful I believe I spoke to a Paul! Who knew everything I requested! I felt safe knowing how helpful he was (Friendly Helpful Staff All Round)"
May 2017,Perfect!,"Our second stay at Brown's Hotel and it delivers in all aspects of a perfect stay.   The ambiance within the hotel is warm, friendly and you feel there is always someone more than happy to help if needed.   I couldn't fault the hotel and it lived up to my expectations from our previous stay without any trouble at all.  Perfect location and central to just about everything. The breakfast on offer is terrific.  The staff are amazing right from the concierges to the front desk staff. Having flown in a day later than my family they could tell it had been a long flight and it was late at night so they parked some of the usual check-in requirements until the morning.  Perfect!"
June 2017,Mid week,We decided to visit London and were recommended this hotel. Wow what a find the restaurant was amazing and the food great. The bedroom suite was massive and well equipped. The staff were all very professional we will be back
May 2017,Perfect for High Tea in Mayfair,"Formal affair, but in a good way. The exterior of this historic building is sheer class, good for serious meetings and an atmosphere which reminds me of the dining rooms filmed in the Titanic movie. patrons are quite upper-class, the service impeccable. would love to go there though its really not my kettle of fish.   but is highly recommended for those who love to experience luxury and service quality at the highest level"
May 2017,A terrific place to stay with great service,"My wife and I stayed at Browns during a week in May while attending a legal conference in London.  The room we got was really nice and for sure it was large enough for a longer stay.  But, what stands out for me during our stay was the wonderful and attentive service  -- starting with Michele at the front desk, David at the Concierge desk and, of course, the really terrific front doorman, John.  Those people and more made our stay very comfortable and pleasant.  Thanks to you all."
May 2017,Mayfair as it's best,Returning back to London we again stayed at Brown's hotel London. Located very central to can easily reach the major points of interest in walking distance. Nice restaurants nearby. The hotel itself has very friendly and attentive staff and the interior gives a very comfortable atmosphere.  
May 2017,"Decadent setting, service previously lacking but now recovered","My girlfriend went for afternoon tea with some of her friends and wrote to the manager because they found the service a let down. They wrote back and offered us a free glass of champagne by way of apology. We returned specifically for this as we were in the area and the front of house and bar staff were wonderfully polite and lovely.   We chose from the champagne menu, had some complimentary amuse bouche and delicious smokey almonds, and had a lovely relaxing sit down. The setting, drinks, food and service were faultless on this visit."
May 2017,London oasis,"Wonderful relaxing stay.  Great service and personal attention.  Spacious, comfortable room with good work space and large walk-in closet.  Outstanding location near theatre district, Piccadilly, and Trafalgar Square"
April 2017,very smart elegant hotel in the heart of Mayfair close to Piccadilly and The Ritz,was meeting a new client so we opted for nearby Donovans Bar. The hall was decorated in a beautiful flower arrangement which I stopped to admire before having drinks in the bar. The bar is intimate and was busy even at 6;15 but was pretty noisy I think due to the echoing of sound so we didn't stay long as we wanted to have a proper chat so we went to the Arts Club just a few yards away.
May 2017,Posh cocktail bar in Mayfair inside Brown's hotel,"The bar is located on the ground floor of the hotel, passing through the tea room, right at the end of it. It's quite a posh place as you would expect given its location, the staff is super nice and they have an impressive menu in terms of drinks. Cocktail prices range between £17-£20, and they also have an impressive wines list. The range os beers was a bit limited to around 4-5 different ones starting at £7 from what I remember.  If you're looking to impress your date it's definitely a good option :) although expect to spend a bit more than in a Soho cocktail bar."
May 2017,Quiet Quality,"Stayed here for a trip to the Chelsea Flower Show. Checking in was friendly, efficient and professional. The room was spacious (for London), clean and well equipped.  The staff were all extremely helpful and attentive without being intrusive."
May 2017,Surpasses expectations,"We stayed at this hotel for the first time having used a number of other hotels in the area for our previous visits. Our arrival followed an early morning journey from Dover. The arrival experience was friendly, efficient and helpful and included a welcome cup of tea . Our room was large, clean and quiet with a large bathroom. All of the staff with whom we came into contact were friendly, helpful, and willing to go out of their way to offer help when it was sought, also offering what turned out to be expert and accurate advice on a number of our sight-seeing excursions. Donovans Bar was a welcome place to have a quiet drink after a busy day or evening. The fact that Ruinart is the house champagne adds to the moment. While we did not take it, the award winning afternoon tea…"
May 2017,Outstanding Experience,"We chose Brown's London because our previous stays at Rocco Forte hotels in Rome, Brussels and Edinburgh were wonderful. We were even more impressed in London!! We felt their attention to our particular needs created a stress-free London experience. We HIGHLY recommend Brown's London and the Rocco Forte group. "
March 2017,"Brown's Hotel, London, the best it ever gets!","I have been staying at Rocco Forte hotels, across the world, for many years. The attitude, approach and culture of the staff remains a solid consistent, at Brown's. The experience is magnificent, it has never changed in that regard. As ever,  it does so much more than it says on the tin! "
March 2017,perfection,"Just the most wonderful hotel, discreet, with just the most exceptional staff who show utmost care for your well being and just do that little extra that makes this hotel so special and better than the competition.  Can not recommend it enough. The flowers in the hotel are worthy of a mention alone, together with the most beautiful fig toiletries from a previously unheard of brand,Heeley. A very special place for a special treat/occasion/splurge."
March 2017,Wonderful afternoon tea,"Taken here by our kids for a family celebration, specifically for afternoon tea. The public areas of the hotel are very traditional, but lovely all the same. The lounge area where the tea was served was equally pleasant, a good ambience and none of the feeling of rush and over crowding that seems to be typical of so many hotels serving afternoon tea.  The service was relaxed but efficient.  We were allowed to linger for two hours over the meal with plenty of time between the savoury dishes and the yummy cakes and scones. The amuse bouches (one beforehand and one between the 'courses') were a nice touch, as was replacing the sandwiches and scones on request as we finished them.  We particularly liked the bitter orange jelly amuse bouche. The main food elements were all excellent…"
March 2017,Lovely stay,"I grew up in London and return often. This is my first time staying at Browns and definitely not my last. Wonderful friendly staff, clean spacious rooms and attentive house keeping. The location is perfect - close to sites but also a little out of the fray of touristy hotels. Close walk to Green Park and Bond street tube stations. We were upgraded to a suite which was such a treat. Will be back. Thank you Browns for a fantastic stay in London."
March 2017,Superb!,"This hotel was absolutely wonderful.  We live in a Ritz Carlton property in the US so we are familiar with top notch service.  The Brown's Hotel is definitely top notch.  The service is amazing, they attend to every need and are extremely helpful.  The restaurant was excellent.  Terrific location.  They even have a house car during the day that can take you to your destination (based on availability).  When we come back to London, this will be our go-to."
March 2017,Simply first class,"Brown's is my favorite place to stay in London.  The staff could not be more warm, welcoming and professional. Both the bar and the restaurant are exceptional.  Loved the coffee, espresso and warm milk and pastries from 5-7am in the reception area--provided a nice jolt to my morning workout.  The hotel is simply first class on every dimension."
March 2017,"great hotel, great service, good location and spacey rooms","great hotel with very friendly staff, fast reception process. Fast reacting concierge, good location and spacey rooms (especially in London where most are rather small). Very clean, lots of light in rooms and lobby, a bit slow service in hotel restaurant HIX, nice afternoon tea"
March 2017,Must stay!,"Brown's Hotel is not only perfectly located with a very short walk to Bond street and all the shopping areas, it has beautiful rooms and great food options in the Hotel. I can only recommend the afternoon tea in the English Tea room. We also had drinks in the bar, which is slightly dark but very smart nonetheless. It is a very pricey stay but definitely worth it as the level of service is very high."
March 2017,TOY London,Brown's Hotel is in walking distance  to Bond- and Regent Street and Piccadilly Circus perfect for shopping trips and cultural stays the service of the whole staff is absolutely adorable the high tea is very delicous
March 2017,Top Notch Browns,"Browns has always the most attentive staff, it has wonderful suites and a bar to have fun in Fabulous for a shopping stay in the heart of London, there are never any issues, the luxury is pure 5 star and you are always looked after supremely well - thank you again"
January 2017,Exceptional,"The hotel is beautiful, the mix of modern art and traditional furniture and fixtures is seamless. The service is outstanding - charming, warm and friendly staff. You feel truly spoilt staying here. Could not recommend it more."
January 2017,Very Good With Great Service,"I have stayed at this hotel several times, with the most recent stay on January 14, 2017.  An upgraded room was ready and waiting for me when I arrived (I was staying on a free Leading Hotels of the World night award).  Staff were great, housekeeping was great.  Room was spotless.  Only issue I bed it too soft and low to floor.  Did not seem like a true king bed, possibly two twins put together.  Other than this issue, this is a quality hotel with a great location.  They go above and beyond.  I will be back again on February 17 - hope for a firmer bed, but otherwise expect a great stay.  "
January 2017,"Superior Hotel, Staff, Stay","Exceptional one night stay. The welcome, check-in and at check-out was charm and efficiency. We had drinks at the Donovan bar and Afternoon Tea - both of which are at the top of comparable experiences (eg Claridges Tea and Conaught Bar) in terms of quality and service. Exceptional hotel and staff. "
January 2017,London is the best!,"I stayed at Brown's Hotel in my last trip to London. The location is amazing, the service was perfect and my room (junior suite) was very comfortable. All the staff was very friendly and did their best to improve our stay."
January 2017,Teatime Treat,"Marvellous! Visited this lovely hotel for afternoon tea during the festive period and was delighted with everything. Our table was sited very close to the piano(lovely musical accompaniment to tea!) in a comfortable lounge area with a lovely log fire blazing in the grate. After a pleasant welcome from helpful staff, we were shown to our table and soon afterwards our orders were taken.  Tea started off with a delicious beetroot and ginger seasonal drink- quite warming considering how cold it was outdoors! The sandwiches and savoury treats were excellent, so too the warmed scones served with clotted cream and homemade strawberry jam. Then a blood orange jelly palate cleanser arrived(also delicious) followed by an array of beautifully presented cakes and pastries. The tea pots were…"
January 2017,Perfect Party!,"We had a 2 night break here including a private dinner to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday - it couldn't have been any better. Brown's was the perfect location for our celebration - a lovely private dining room, excellent service from the first moment we arrived to our departure and the best food possible.The entire weekend was fabulous and we can't thank the staff there enough for all their hard work. If you have a special occasion to celebrate it will be extra special if you choose Brown's Hotel."
December 2016,THE best afternoon tea in town!,"Browns afternoon tea is memorable for all the right reasons...I really could wax lyrical, but having toured a few of the 'best' venues in London, this just wins hands down, for us. Classy, exclusive, world-class service, food, beverages, music and ambience. Just go, and message us if you disagree!"
January 2017,Shoot,"Perfect loacation, great food, helpful staff bar the front of house who was cold and unhelpful. Quick service of anything we needed. Suite was lovely size if not a bit dark and a strange picture above the desk."
January 2017,A Great Stay in London,"The Brown's Hotel is the place to be!  The staff was incredible and made us feel right at home, especially with our two children (5 & 7). The concierge team was very knowledgeable and made booking things a breeze. The other hotel staff was a delight to be around and very accommodating. The location is one of the best in London as well. A must when visiting London!"
December 2016,Wonderful City Hotel,"Wonderful city hotel and for london standards big rooms. Good price for Christmas time. Very nice breakfast selection and very friendly staff. Cozy tea room atmosphere and bar. Perfect location for piccadilly, soho, regent street and bond street!!"
December 2016,Typical hotel in excellent location,"Very good experience, beautiful and nicely decorated hotel, comfortable rooms despite the many little flies in our bathroom. Very friendly staff giving personalized service. I also had a great spa experience !"
December 2016,Sophisticated and stylish,"From a few oranges left on the side table at evening turn down, to ease of in-room breakfast, no detail was overlooked while also giving us privacy and much-needed recharging. We stayed just two nights but know we will be back. "
December 2016,Luxury in a great location,"Luxurious, friendly hotel in a fabulous location.  Very upmarket yet not snobby or pretentious.  The room was lovely, the staff couldn't do enough for us.  Breakfast was delicious.  We'all definitely return."
December 2016,Browns a real home from home,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay ,Browns is old school charm at its very best.All staff recognised us and called us by name,breakfast is amazing and lots of choice.Location is minutes away from shopping and popular areas.The bar is a great hang out after a hard day in the shops,the afternoon tea looked good too."
December 2016,Afternoon Tea at the Brown's Hotel,"We have just finished our lavish afternoon tea at the Brown's Hotel, this afternoon. The ambiance is very pleasant, with live piano playing, and pleasant and plentiful food, the usual sandwiches, including cucumber ones, delicious scones and home made strawberry jam, with clotted cream and delicious cakes. But what made our afternoon truly nice was the service, provided by Andrea, from Italy, who worked incredible hard! He was on his feet during the whole two hours of our stay and serving us, and everyone else in our room, with a charming, polite smile and a friendly, very attentive service, looking after us, all afternoon perfectly! We have been at several, equally high quality places, for a pre-Christmas afternoon tea events, over the years, but ultimately what makes these…"
December 2016,Little gem ,"What a fabulous place ! A minute you enter you feel relaxed and comfortable , the staff is friendly and Christmas decorations are beautiful .   We had a meal at  Hix restaurant and nothing was too much trouble ! Was busy that evening but service was quick and had a great atmosphere.  Highly recommended ! "
November 2016,It is fantastic hotel,"It is real fantastic hoel with nce staff and very good traditions  Staff is very friendly , ber is very tasty and cozy  I think it is the best place  I have ever been in my life  There are only good words for service of this hotel  Nothing compalin about"
December 2016,Simply stunning lunch and stay - why haven't I been here before ??,Managed to sneak in a quick shopping trip to London before Christmas arrives and was lucky enough to stay at Brown's Hotel. I have to say the hotel wasn't my choice (a friend made the booking) so it was a very pleasant surprise.   The room was much larger than I expected in Central London and was the perfect retreat from the chaos outside the hotel and the staff were all so friendly and welcoming. We were so delighted with the hotel we decided to have lunch in the restaurant (Hix) and turned out to be very glad we did !  We somehow managed to loose several hours of shopping to both the restaurant and bar (not a hardship in any way) and are already making plans for a repeat visit next year !!!!!  Massive thank you to all the team for making it such a delightful visit.
December 2016,Great cocktails ,I work just round the corner from the hotel and the lobby is perfect for meetings. They serve excellent cocktails and the waiters are very attentive and welcoming. I really like the old English decor and elegant surroundings
December 2016,A truly wonderful lunch in a stunning hotel.,"Visited with a friend for a bite to eat before the theatre - what a treat from beginning to end. We were greeted at the door by such welcoming staff, and felt thoroughly spoilt by very attentive thoughtful service. The food was delicious and indeed our light snack lunch turned into a three course delight, we just didn't want to leave. A big ""Thank You"" to all the staff who made us feel so at home."
November 2016,Great property in a great location,"Excellent stay - very nice room, breakfast was great - would definitely recommend  Stayed in room 212 - very spacious and comfortable  While it doesn't have a view it felt very welcoming and was a good home base for a recent business trip"
November 2016,Fabulous Hotel with even better service,"Stayed in a fabulous Deluxe Suite - incredible!! The service from valet, doormen, reception to restaurant and bar - all were amazing. Very personalized and detailed service. Highly recommend and will definitely return!"
November 2016,Great hotel,Excellent location. Really comfortable hotel with delightful staff. Traditional and very English but also uunstuffy and welcoming. Our room (junior suite I think) was stylish and quietly luxurious. AND I could work out how everything worked easily (more than you can say for some hotels). Definitely would recommend.
November 2016,Number 1 in London,"Best location, best service, warm & cozy interior it really reflects London!!!  Do not look further: I have visited and stayed at many other 5 star hotels in London and Brown's hotel is the best around. "
November 2016,Always great.,"I love staying at Browns when visiting London, the central location is perfect and the staff always ready to help make your stay. This trip was a short one but the place is fabulous. Looking forward to staying again when I visit next. Thank you Browns."
November 2016,Iconic Hotel,"A most enjoyable two night stay to celebrate a special Wedding Anerversry. Very attentive staff our name was always remembered. The room was nicely furnished and spotlesly clean with a large bathroom with a very large bath,most likely the largest we have experienced.  The location is just perfect for central London."
November 2016,Absolutely perfect,"In my job, I am lucky enough to stay in fabulous hotels often - but because I am away from my home comforts so much it matters to me that things are easy and comfortable. Of all the wonderful places I have stayed this takes the top spot in London (and elsewhere!)  by MILES. It starts from the moment you walk up to the hotel - the welcome from everyone on arrival - from the doormen to Reception -  is smiley, exquisitely polite and genuine. It's true that it is expensive and luxurious but it's beautifully done by EVERYONE with the most incredible warmth. Such a rarity. Too often hotels in this bracket are snooty and full of their own self-importance (The Langham springs to mind) but this is how to do it properly. In a high-class field of staff, a special mention should go to…"
November 2016,Relaxing Stay,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Browns, the staff were very attentive and couldn't do enough.  We stayed in a Junior Suite which was very comfortable and decorated to a high standard. We are looking forward to our next stay at Browns."
November 2016,Very good service,"The sevice is very good, very nice staff, they do go above and beyond however the room is very basic plus there was a whole in the wall in my bathroom waiting to be fixed. The location is very good for shopping and public transportation "
November 2016,The only place worth staying!,"Brown's is discreet, quiet and elegant. The staff are accommodating in the extreme, the rooms comfortable and the location unimpeachable. The rates are reasonable, and in all aspects the hotel is impeccably run. If you are looking for an oasis of calm in the middle of London then Brown's is it. The food is excellent too."
November 2016,Consistent fantastic experience,"My all-time favourite in London. Excellent location, attentive staff, very nice rooms and hilarious breakfast make this an all-time favourite in London. A slight mishap upon checking in was immediately corrected in a very professional manner. Perfect staff and very nice to see that many of the staff have been with the hotel since years."
October 2016,"Excelent location, wonderful service","A lovely hotel in a great location and  with excellent service.  We had a complementary upgrade to a Junior Suit, late ckeckI out, and other amenities.  The beds at Brown´s are very comfy and Hix Restaurant delicious ( I had  dover sole for dinner).   I highly recommend Hotel Brown´s, we were very happy there, I hope to return soon.   Thank you Hotel Brown`s."
October 2016,I Love This Place,"I have stayed a Browns a few times and I like it more each time I go back.  The staff are great and they remember you from your previous visits.   The rooms are very clean and well designed, The house keeping is also top notch.  I stayed there recently with my wife for her 40th Birthday and they put balloons in the room and a cake which was great.  Keep up the excellent work."
November 2016,Best value luxury hotel in London,"By London standards, the room was large and sensibly as well as comfortably furnished. Also by London Top end standards, not expensive. The staff is invariably courteous and pleasant. The English breakfast is to be avoided - cheap ingredients,  indifferently cooked at a high price. The buffet on the other hand is excellent - brilliant cheeses, lovely fruit and other offerings (which I did not get to taste). The hotel cannot help the gloomy English autumn weather but, though they provide a lot more lamps than other good London hotels, for my Australiana eyes, a bit more light would be welcome. Unfortunately the restaurant is to be avoided. Poor value but more importantly badly cooked food. My son had stake tartare and I fish with peas - both made us feel that we made a mistake in…"
November 2016,"Excellent, again!","My wife and I stayed here for a long birthday weekend and had another excellent experience at Brown's! Our previous visit was a year ago and we upgraded this time to one of their larger rooms, a Junior Suite, to enjoy the larger space. We were delighted to have a complimentary fresh fruit basket and delicious Hix Trio during our stay. While the particular room was very comfortable, there were a few minor niggles with the bed; however, their pillows were super!  We enjoyed an excellent meal in their restaurant one evening; their gym was very convenient and their inclusive breakfasts were delicious!  Keep up the great standards and service: we are looking forward to our next visit!"
November 2016,Ho Hum,"Arrived at 4.15 pm...room not ready, very poor. Welcome to Brown. Came back 45 mins later and could get into my room. £7 for a small beer in the bar, then they add service. Room uninspiring (112)....see photos. No view. No iron in room, poor. Good bathroom. Very expensive hotel, expensive bar, expensive restaurant, but it's Mayfair so that's what you should expect.   Probably will not return."
November 2016,Excellent home from home,"The location is excellent , the staff superb and the beds/. Duvets provide the best sleep ever experienced In a Hotel. Nothing was too much trouble : the in-room breakfast was delivered very quickly and was excellent . The cocktails were to die for - a great experience !"
November 2016,Confortable stay,It was so nice and confortanle stay there.The staff was so kind to help us anything.and the location is really good at shopping.Green park station is just walking distance. Facility looks not so new.However I highly reccomend to stay. 
November 2016,The Best,"Great overall stay with terrific service. Dinner at HIx was special. Wonderful breakfasts. Management needs to improve the business center. Computers are obsolete, and having to get a code to use them and which doesn't work is ridiculous in this day and age. Wifi service is poor. Have to sign in every day and pay extra for high speed. Even lesser hotels have better service."
November 2016,Great base for a sporting trip,Yet again Browns hotel made me feel welcoming and comfortable despite this being a trip for the England v Scotland International Football and presenting myself in a Kilt.  Room service was swift when required and food cooked to my taste.  Staying here made it easy to get to my friends in Hammersmith as well as access to the tube for the big game.
November 2016,Fabulous stay,Had a wonderful time as always at Browns. Classy and Fabulous with the best staff. Cannot wait to be back and enjoy the hotel again. You can't beat it. Perfect location and rooms are incredible - enjoy!!
November 2016,Experience of several stays,"We have stayed at this hotel for several years, at least once  a year. Though it is a five star hotel it gives you the feeling of home - the take care of you and no task is impossible! Location is great."
November 2016,Very good location and helpful staff.,"If you go to London for business, leasure or, specially, shopping, thesis your hotel. Excel.lent staff ready to help and service. The only thing to reclaim is the quality of wifi. at least in our executive room. and, because it's an old renewed building, a little difficult to find your room as it has a lot of stairs and corners. anyway, very recomendable hotel (with a healthy credit card!). Thanks."
November 2016,"Excellent, small and cosy","Good attitude of all the personnal. Quiet and clean rooms. Hix restaurant : very British and excellent foot and wine. An overall charming hotel and location. Attentive staff, starting at the entrance, ending boy leaving the hotel.... "
November 2016,Pampering hotel stay in Mayfair,We are more than pleased with our stay at Brown´s. The location was perfect on a quiet street. The service was excellent and we slept like babies in the comfortable beds. Small luxury details through the entire stay such as housekeeping preparing the beds while we where out for dinner. We will definitely be back.
November 2016,Great Hotel in a great location,Was a great weekend at Brown's. It is so convenient to have a base in the heart of Mayfair. Rooms are nice and quiet. Service is great. The Bar astonished me with a large selection of Gin which I loved. We will be back
November 2016,Birthday treat!,"Exemplary welcome, service and room..we felt relaxed and at home from the moment we arrived....beautiful hotel...thank you for making us feel special...we will be back and will be sure to recommend Browns to all!"
November 2016,Family visit Nov 2016,"Did not live up to its usual flawless service. In the past the welcome to our family has been fantastic. A few things were missing this time, which could be considered minor but which actually set apart Browns from other hotels."
November 2016,Unforgettable Stay with fantastic staff,"It started with a very warm welcome at the door and continued with an excellent and friendly check-in at this beautiful located hotel. They showed us the whole property and introduced the staff while going to our room. It was super clean and we had everything we needed. Especially the friendly and very helpful concierge team (Thanks David) created a perfect start to the trip with the hotel car to a recommended sushi restaurant! All in all, we had a great time and would definatly come back for any other London trip in the future. Thanks to all...!!"
November 2016,My first time at Browns, usually stay at claridge's but was unable this time have eaten in HIX restaurant many times So this was my first time I have stayed in Browns 's was very impressed from the moment I arrived great service I stayed on fourth floor over looking courtyard lovely room all the staff were a credit to  this hotel  goodbye claridge's now will be staying at Browns.'s in future 
October 2016,October 2016,"Excellent hotel, also for families. Good location. Large rooms and very friendly and helpful staff. from the hotel you can walk to a big part of the attractions and shops. If you like English tradition and style,choose this hotel."
October 2016,Wonderful stay,"Great location, staff was very polite and friendly making you feel almost at home. Breakfast was well served from the buffet or à la  carte. Rooms are comfortable and  spacious. I will definitely come back!"
August 2016,Great hotel with worst technology,"Stayed here with my Girlfriend for the weekend, loved the hotel and staff, and the English tea time, wanted to spoil my Girlfriend so I booked a SPA treatment and a dinner reservation both via the Rocco Forte app, did both the bookings in app, took forever, and when she arrived at SPA no booking was there, same for our dinner reservation.. Just embarrassing that its 2016 and the hotels cant handle simple technology - Will still for sure come back, just not use the apps.."
November 2015,English tea,"Great atmosphere for me as a single attendee.  Service was great, piano playing in the background.  The food and tea were outstanding.  The hotel itself was beautiful.   This was recommmended by my coincerge at the hotel I was staying and American Express made the reservation for me."
October 2016,Perfectly Pleasant!!,"A terrific location for upscale shopping and amazing food. Above all, however, the staff is unmatched in their hospitality, warmth and friendliness.  A lovely piece of London tradition and history, the food and service is excellent. My husband and I stayed 8 nights and could not have been more comfortable. We attended a reception, Sunday bottomless brunch with local friends,a Hix dinner event and a Traditional English Tea. All were wonderful and top quality. We had a 6am checkout and there was complimentary coffee, tea, croissants etc. for those departing early. A class act from check in to check out!"
October 2016,the best,"the inside is much better than how it looks from the outside, bigger room, good service, interesting history, better than the ritz for sure. place to experience history of London. very expensive however  recommended. "
September 2016,good but not perfect,"I was rather disappointed with this 5 star hotel. entering, it is not easy to find the reception.  the staff always seems overwhelmed and makes you feel almost interrupting and disturbing. the tea room is very nice.  tea preparation is correct.  the uniforms of the waiters are immaculate, except the butler -a rather pompous- to whom it lacks a button from his jacket the rooms are spacious, comfortable and quiet. space for relaxation and spa are rather small."
October 2016,Very happy,I arrived early at the hotel (9.30am) after having got up at 3am to make my flight to London. I was fully expecting just to drop my suitcase - but the welcome from reception was excellent you are always welcome at Browns and of course you room is ready! This sums up the whole experience at the hotel which could not have been better 
October 2016,Excellent.,"Excellent hotel, exceptional location. The rooms are very new and contemporary, although the hotel is in a historical building. The breakfast is amazing.  The hotel team could not be more kind!  Loved it! "
September 2016,Wonderful Stay at Brown's Hotel,This is the ONLY place to stay in London.  The hotel and entire staff are beyond exceptional.  They will exceed your expectations at every turn.  Guests are treated to a special and pampered experience when staying here.  We had 3 rooms during our recent stay and each and every one of our guests in our group could not stop talking about how impressed they were with the hotel experience.
November 2016,Amazing,"The experience was amazing. The service is very nice, warm and lovely. I really recommend to stay in Brown's Hotel. The location is perfect, The rooms are beautiful and comfortable. I really enjoyed my stay in London!!!"
November 2016,A very sweet Suite!!,"We hired the latest addition to the Browns Hotel room collection, the Kipling Suite. We were so impressed with every element from guest experience to in room facilities. Wow is an understatement....  staff are super helpful in every way possible. The room knocks spots off its competitors, large, luxury and beyond comparison in London. This is the room to end all rooms. "
November 2016,Room 116,"We were allocated this room which is not suitable midweek as directly opposite the room is a meeting room. My husband was trying to gain access into our room as was told to be quiet by one of the attendees of the meeting , "
November 2016,The perfect London retreat,A quiet and beautiful haven from the London hustle and bustle.  In David Young the hotel has a truly superb concierge offer which will afford the guest the very best looking boon has to offer . . . I would recommend this hotel above all others I have ever used. 
November 2016,Fantastic ,"This hotel is my new home in London after this stay. I usually stay in Mayfair. However, the rooms are luxurious and practical. The staff goes out of its way to accommodate your needs. The location is lovely. Close to everything but yet obscure in its placement. They have won my loyal patronage. Keep up the grand work  "
November 2016,Very Happy Overall,This is a classic property in one of the best locations in London.  It is well managed and immaculately clean.  Staff was superb with fantastic memory for names!  My only disappointment was that I felt my specific room lacked character consistent with the other spaces in the hotel.  It was roomy and comfortable for one night but the decor of the room was on the pedestrian side.   
November 2016,Perfect,Perfect in every way.  At just a stone throw from Bond Street provides luxury with top service and a cosy intimate environment.  Service is among the best you will find anywhere and we stay regularly in top hotels around the world.
October 2016,"Splendid Attention , Splendid Fare","On this latest trip to London we chose Browns because of their Mayfair location, near shopping and Piccadilly, and their superior service.  They did not disappoint.   When we made our reservation, we  mentioned that our 10 year old granddaughter,who was wanting to see the historic sights of London, was joining us.  The exceptional concierge, David,  arranged for the perfect tour guide: informative and very friendly. Later, the hotel delivered  cookies with her name on them to our rooms , which were both comfortable and beautifully appointed. Our granddaughter was thrilled.   Brown's dining room and attentive service are world famous; they deserve every  starred  accolade  possible."
October 2016,British,This was an excellent choice of hotels. Our stay was for pleasure and business. The service was fast and very polite. I will highly recommend this hotel. Close to the Piccadilly if you like to walk. The hotel cars was excellent and luxuries. We felt special.
October 2016,Our Home in Mayfair,"Could not have chosen a better luxury hotel to call 'home' in Mayfair!  Perfect location just off the madness of Piccadilly on Albermarle, yet within easy walking distance of West End. Brown's makes you feel right at home from the moment you step inside the hotel. Check-in is a breeze and concierge is very helpful (remember to tip accordingly!) Lively atmosphere, can't miss afternoon tea, and gourmet dining at HIX. Donovan's bar is fun for drinks with the after-work crowd. Rooms are well appointed, quiet and modern. Beds are heavenly - you will wake up well- rested. Best breakfast in London!!  "
October 2016,London Home Away From Home,"Browns is responsible for making London my favorite city to visit.  Most central location, chic amazingly comfortable rooms, fantastic bar and restaurant and the warmest most professional staff that make you want to move in. Hard to even leave the hotel once in London and a place of solace during any busy trip. Classic, elegant, tasteful and cool. I hope it never changes.  "
October 2016,Short Stay Fam visit,"We spent 1 night at the Brown's Hotel. What a wonderful and unforgettable experience. Wish we would have had more time to enjoy this wonderful Hotel. The hotel has elegant , tasteful, historical influences. You will not get tired to browse around discovering new details and art-I-facts throughout. The Donovan Bar makes for bustling experience of award winning Cocktails. The Hotel Restaurant and Food  The Hix , we enjoyed the best brunch ever with exceptional waiting staff. The Brown's offered first class service ,yet making us feel like family with their very warm and friendly staff. Thank you again for your excellent service."
October 2016,A Plesant Surprise in the Heart of Mayfair,Great location in the heart of Mayfair one block from New Bond street. Easy walk to Oxford Street and all the great restaurants in Mayfair. Older buildings turned into a hotel decades ago lead to slight differences in floor levels so you have two steps up here and four down there. The rooms are bright and airy and as it is on a side street the car noise is minimal. The front desk staff is very professional and the concierges really do know all the 'in' restaurants and can actually get you a reservation. Great bar for a quiet drink.
October 2016,High tea at its best,"My daughter, her friend and I had high tea and it was excellent. We have had high tea in many places and countries, this ranks among the best we have ever had. It may indeed be the best!   The food was plentiful, tasty and a wonderful variety. The egg salad, salmon and corned beef sandwiches were exceptional. The scones were to die for and the the only slightly less amazing dessert treats were all delicious. The tea varieties were varied and exceptional.  Highly recommend this classic English high tea in an old world setting!"
October 2016,Short London stay,"My wife and I over-nighted in London and spent 1 night at Brown's.  I wish we had scheduled more time.  The hotel is elegant.  The staff is very warm and friendly.  And, the location off of Piccadilly and Bond Street is excellent.  The concierge picked the perfect restaurant for us and made the reservation on such short notice that I'm convinced he is a magician(or at least extremely influential.)    The bar in the evening was lively and very comfortable and a good place to relax before dinner.  The hotel is definitely an A+ for anyone needing luxury accommodations in London."
October 2016,Personalised service Hotel ,"Great hospitality, service and food. Second home feeling every time we go. Rooms are spacious and clean. Room service is quick. They always remember you. Staff is always helpful and friendly. And their consistency is remarkable."
March 2016,Classic hotel with style,"I've been there during a business trip and my stay was great. Very good located, easy accessible the staff was very professional and the breakfast was great. The style is traditional with contemporary touches. Very beautiful the bar and the breakfasts room. "
October 2016,Good of enough for Winston...,"Lovely boutque hotel in London that was apparently one of Churchill's favorites. Very great location in Mayfair area (especially if you want to shop in high-end shops).  Front desk and concierge team were terrific.  Room was nicely appointed, although mine was a bit small.  Nice size bathroom.  Breakfast expensive and not as good as I remembered."
October 2016,London at its best ,"What a lovely stay and so much joy for kids and adults a like! very detail oriented house and staff. Most comfortable beds! Little things as give aways for the kids made them so happy! Location great for trips, shops and tube. Definetly coming back!"
October 2016,we love Browns!,"Our second stay here. We love the 5 star yet friendly and approachable service. The hotel has a traditional yet contemporary feel that is very inviting. The location is excellent for shopping, dining, sightseeing. Kudos to General manager Stuart Johnson who is hands on and runs this finely tuned hotel !"
September 2016,Great Hotel and Staff,"From the moment we arrived I knew this hotel would be special.  The staff was attentive and courteous.  Ate at the restaurant our first night and had such an enjoyable evening decided to eat there again.  Enjoyed having a drink at the bar, the bartender was very pleasant.  We also enjoyed tea and the service was excellent and the piano music made it perfect.  This will be my first choice when visiting London."
August 2016,Excellent service,"Brown's is now my favorite London hotel, and it is thanks to the wonderful service.  Everyone at this property is helpful, friendly, and very competent.  Additionally, the food is delicious - the breakfast buffet is extensive and hot items are made-to-order.  I have stayed at the Savoy and the Corinthia, and neither come close to matching this hotel's service, sincerity, and authenticity.  Brown's is a special retreat in the heart of Mayfair, and it will be my first choice on future trips to London."
September 2016,Very epensive for what you get,Not up to standard of a 5 stars hotel / 850 BP per night. Very poor quality of furntiures in the room and very old carpets. Need a full renovation. AC very noisy in the room. House keeping not the most friendly.
September 2016,The edge...,Great hotel in the heart of London. From the sincere welcome I first received from the doorman to the moment I had to leave my stay was excellent. I normally stay at claridges when I visit London but Browns may have the edge.
September 2016,A very pleasant hotel,"In a great location and has an excellent sense of charm. Just a few minutes to the tube and Green Park leading onto Buckingham Palace.  The greeting at reception was very good and nice that this is tucked away so that you don't feel on parade as everyone else comes in and out.  Our room was very pleasant with a comfy bed, choice of pillows, walk in wardrobe and a very spacious bathroom. The only downside is we could clearly hear the people above us moving around (and presumably those below could hear us). But this did not spoil the visit and perhaps to be expected in a very old building.  The hotel bar is lovely and the staff were very attentive. Had one of their 'Around the World' cocktails which earned me a stamp and a scratch and sniff business card for that region, a bit of…"
September 2016,true Londonian hospitality,"Lovely hotel which managed to keep its true Londonian charm. The architect managed to unite old with new in a fabulous way. Rooms are spacious and very comfortable, the choice of colours is excellent. I quite liked the bookshelf with an interesting reading choice. Spacious wardrobe (important) and big bathroom which is beautifully clean too. Personnel is incredibly friendly and efficient and makes you feel home. All in all, a wonderful experience. Thank you."
September 2016,London at its best!,"A gracious historic but totally renovated and modernized building combining traditional charm with modern amenities, Browns lets one experience the London one hopes for.  Service is quintessentially polite, rooms are quiet and comfortable and the ambiance is of refined yet unobtrusive elegance. "
September 2016,Exceptional,"A truly special weekend away, in a perfect setting.  All staff were extremely helpful and accomodating, the room exceptional and the location couldn't be better for shopping, theatre and the sights of London."
September 2016,Birthday afternoon tea absolutely  amazing,Cannot recommend afternoon tea enough. We went for my 40th birthday the setting the food are excellent. The staff are an absolute  credit to the hotel so warm and welcoming and couldn't do enough for you. It's a beautiful hotel with so much history  thoroughly recommend it . 
September 2016,Not a grand hotel,"This hotel, albeit rated 5 stars, is not one of London's grand hotels. It is an okay 5 star hotel but is not one of the grand stand-alone properties which are so typical for London. Eg. Reception is hidden somewhere in the back part of the property. Gym and Spa are small and lack grandour"
September 2016,Brown's Hotel London,Brown's is an excellent hotel in the Mayfair area of London. Lots of incredible restaurants close by and the concierge is extremely helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel. The Hix Mayfair restaurant at the hotel is great for breakfast and dinner.
September 2016,Nice!!,"Nice and well located hotel, rooms are nice (size depends), bathroom and amenities are excellent. The bed is a key feature for me as it is so comfortable.  Staff is polite and eager to satisfy any queries"
September 2016,Outstanding experience,"You can not top Brown's when you are in London. Can't beat the location, the great rooms, the impeccable service and the art shown. If you love history as well (e.g. Winston Churchill was a regular) and you do not like to wake up like in certain hotel chains where the rooms look all the same no matter what city you are in, this is the place to stay."
September 2016,"Great Location, Great Accomodation",this is the perfect address if you wish to visit London in style.. we enjoyed our stay in a warm and comfortable surrounding.. the location is great and the staff very friendly and responsive .. you would certainly want to come back..
September 2016,The best in London,"The brown's is not a conventional hotel,it makes you feel like home,when you're away. The food is amazing,the breakfast is an awesome experience,the Donovan bar is warm welcoming and serves the best cocktail you can taste. The concierge service is second to none,and the location is unique. Do not hesitate to adopt the Brown's while in London"
September 2016,Outstanding comfort in the center of Mayfair,A remarkable hotel with 175 years history just a few steps from Bond Street with its boutiques and shops.  The best afternoon tea in London. A very professional Consierge who can help with organizing tickets for any evening performance and advise many interesting things to do and to see.
September 2016,Excellent Hotel,"Five of us stayed one night on a special  visit to London. Two standard rooms and one executive room. Executive room  overlooks Dover Street. Situated in Albermarle Street in Mayfair so it is pricey as one would expect. Only 5 minute walk to The Ritz and about 7 minutes to Green Park tube station. Just off Picadilly and about 2 minutes from Old Bond Street and Burlington Arcade. Tiffanys is just round the corner for those with money to spare! All the hotel staff have a nice style: attentive but not intrusive, sociable and not pretentious. Breakfast excellent, dinner excellent. Lovely restaurant. Decor in the rooms is light and classy. Only black mark for me is a lack of tea and coffee making facilities in the room. The hotel is very relaxing. "
September 2016,One of the very best luxury hotels in London,"This hotel is truly 5 star and delivers in every conceivable way.  Modern, superbly appointed, highest quality rooms, bedding and baths, detailed and professional turndown service, fantastic concierge services and wonderful on property restaurant.  Fantastic London location.  A must stay for those seeking the truly refined, luxury stay.  Unlike other mass London luxury hotels, this is the adult, refined, modern, civilized and highly personalized experience. I did not want to leave and look forward to my return!"
September 2016,London's best hotel,"Another fantastic stay at what must be the best hotel group! Professional and friendly employees who make every stay memorable. Nothing is too much trouble. Coupled with a luxurious environment, Browns Hotel is simply the best Mayfair offering."
September 2016,Birthday treat,The hotel was excellent and the service was outstanding. Location is great for high end shopping and I don't think I would stay anywhere else - much preferred it to Claridges and my 14 year old daughter loved afternoon tea.
September 2016,Wonderful stay,"Only stayed for a day but felt so pampered and taken care of that i wanted to stay to never end. everything was top notch, the staff were friendly and so attentive to our need. The property was in excellent shape and condition. We didn't hear anything even with they renovation going on our floor. I will want to stay at Browns every time I'm in London. "
September 2016,LOVE it!,"I stayed at Brown's last year and when I decided to come to London to celebrate a milestone birthday, I knew I had to come back.  The location, the rooms, the staff, the history of the hotel, it's all wonderful. Everything was impeccable.  I have recommended this to hotel to many friends and business associates.  "
September 2016,A lovely afternoon tea experience,"It was our first visit to Brown’s hotel and we really enjoyed the wonderful traditional afternoon tea. We were served by Miguel, who gave us a great teatime experience. One can choose from several very tasty finger sandwiches followed by warm scones with homemade jam and of course, not to forget the different teas. Whenever we felt like trying a new blend, Miguel served us a delicious cup in silver tea sets and nice porcelain tea cups. The third course consisted of cakes and macarons which were a little too sweet for our taste, but all in all we had a lovely time in this elegant Mayfair hotel.  The whole atmosphere is very British, our chairs were comfy, service and menu were excellent. And the nice live piano music really adds to this unforgettable experience. Time flies easily…"
August 2016,Particularly,"We like the design of the rooms. It looks exclusive, plain and we feel like home. In the hotel you feel the history and it is a particular that this building is a hotel. In some situations you feel like in the past and you can understand a lot of things. "
August 2016,Luxury in London,"Spent 2 nights at Brown's Hotel in London. Lovely twin room, although small it was well presented with excellent bathroom. Continental breakfast in the restaurant was well presented and lots of options. Being such a central location close to Green Park made this great for shopping. Most of the staff can't do enough for you - very attentive and helpful. I have previously sent my parents to the hotel for a trip away which they throughly enjoyed. "
August 2016,Afternoon Tea,"We visited earlier in the month for a hen party. We had the Roosevelt room which was absolutely beautiful. I cannot stress enough how brilliant and attentive the staff were from start to finish. The afternoon tea itself was fabulous, unlimited sandwiches- what's not to love? Staff were very accommodating with other refreshments such as coffee, hot chocolate and water for those who didn't like tea. Nothing was too much for anyone, I would thoroughly recommend Browns for afternoon tea, or for a special occasion. Many thanks to Imogen in the events team who organised the day, also a big thanks to the gentleman who looked after us on the day (apologies as I cannot remember his name) but he was very attentive. "
August 2016,Fabulous Afternoon Tea,"Visited Browns today for afternoon tea as a pre baby/30th birthday celebration. From the minute we arrived and were shown to our very comfortable armchairs the service was impeccable. Very friendly and superbly efficient, I didn't even have to top up my own tea cup!  The tea menu is extensive and it is lovey to be able to ask the staff for more information  and recommendations if you are unsure. The selection of sandwiches were all delicious and the lovely staff provided many refills. The warm scones with fresh, homemade jam and clotted cream were soft and crumbly-the only downside was we couldn't manage them all! The next treat was a beautiful selection of delicate pastries and mini-deserts. The highlight has to be a sublimely rich chocolate slice with rich dark ganache and…"
September 2015,Heart of mayfair,"English style is the point  Afternoon tea, staff and service make you feel in London The suites are big enough and check in very easy with helpful people. Very well located, steps from New Bond street, in the heart of Mayfair."
August 2016,Fabulous stay -,Excellent hotel and service - Fabulous staff and the rooms exceptional. Close to old bond street so good shopping nearby. We have stayed several times before and always had a fabulous room and great attention- and would not hesitate to recommend to all of our family and friends - Excellent Browns Hotels again .  
August 2016,Perfect!!,Fantastic location. Friendly staff. The room was spacious and had everything we could need. The staff couldn't do enough to make our stay perfect!!!  The bar had a really good atmosphere. Although we didn't eat in the restaurant we did have some snacks in the bar which were delicious!  Highly recommend this hotel! 
September 2015,Perfect!,"The first time I came to Browns' was five years ago when a close friend celebrated his wedding here. It would only be 3 years until I would experience staying here. I'm so glad I finally did for my 28th birthday thanks to my parents. A week to remember. This place is situated in the heart of the city and is easy to commute and from any airport.  The staff assigned to your suite is always only a call away, ready to serve you and your friends at a drop of a hat.  There is nothing these warm people won't do to make your stay that little bit more special. Enjoy the breakfast in your room or go downstairs for brunch or tea.  If you enjoy staying in style then I strongly recommend staying at least a long weekend."
August 2016,"Great location, but I expected more in my room for the money","This property is very well located for shopping. We were not interested in seeing the museums and common tourist sites. Been there and done that. This one's all about the location. After just having stayed at another Rocco Hotel, the Hotel de Rome in Berlin, I was a bit disappointed. Our room paled in comparison. I guess it's London. This should be what I expected. The service and amenities were equally exceptional. Not sure I would stay there again unless we upgrade to a suite or ask to see more rooms. We were offered the opportunity to look at other rooms on our arrival, but we were tired and just wanted to get checked in. We'll know better if we return."
August 2016,Perfect afternoon tea.,"Booked this hotel for afternoon tea has it had been recommended to me several times and we were not disappointed; faultless.    We arrived and were shown to our table, we went with the traditional afternoon tea.  We went for a bottle of champagne to share on the side.  There were plenty of teas/flavours to pick from.  We went for the Cornish tea and it was nice, suited the afternoon tea well.   The lounge was very comfortable and plenty of space to relax.  A member of staff was playing the panio which really set the atmosphere.   The food was perfect. The cakes and pastries were yummy! Plenty of food.    The staff were all very polite.  The service was first class. We felt very looked after and I honestly can't find any faults with anything."
July 2016,Best location excellent service ,The location is quite yet near everything.  The services was amazing the concierge was extremely helpful specially David. Helped us with hiring baby sitter and book the best restaurants on short notice.  Very friendly with my children.  They have the best doorman.  I would definitely recommend it. 
August 2016,Excellent hotel,Excellent hotel and service. Quietly understated. Best pot of tea in London! We stayed for 2 nights and had a lovely relaxing time there. Staff went out of their way to assist and were very welcoming. As I would expect from a Rocco Forte hotel.
August 2016,London in a rush,"A perfect place. All the staff very helpful. Very close to all the important stores. Restaurant was very very good. Bed extremely clean. The shower, by far, the best in town. To be honest I do not have any recomendation because everything worked out very well.  Many thanks"
August 2016,Special Hotel in a Special Part of London,"Recently attended a business meeting at the Brown's Hotel and stayed in the hotel for three nights. It was an extraordinary pleasure - beautiful room, attentive staff and great food! The surrounding area - Mayfair is lovely - very London like and with lots of services, restaurants and retail. Excellent for walks after dinner. This is a very special hotel! I highly recommend the Brown's Hotel."
July 2016,recent stay,"very quiet room - perfectly presented. All of the staff were very helpful, all the time. ambience great as are the facilities. Restaurant good with great food and fine wine selection. Location great for the west end. London is expensive which is why value for money is less than other cities - would i change it, no !"
July 2016,Weekend in Mayfair,Very nice small hotel with excellent customer service. I would definitely recommend to anyone staying in west end/Mayfair to stay there. Great location and exceptional value compared to equivalent hotels in the area.

July 2016,Afternoon tea -excellent ,"We enjoyed the champagne afternoon tea here yesterday for our wedding anniversary.  The tea lounge is more relaxed than others such as Savoy or Claridges, with a cozy feel. Some of the sandwiches weren't to our taste but we are fussy,  so not the hotels fault at all! All food is unlimited so they'll take away any you don't like and bring you something else. The scones were superb,  and all the cakes very tasty. The service is amazing and unintrusive. A great afternoon "
July 2016,Excellent hotel for a quick getaway or a business trip,"A wonderfully located hotel in central London. I judge a hotel by their consistency, and the Browns has never disappointed me (after an average of two stays a year for the last 5 years).  The rooms are always immaculate, comfortable beds with wonderful amenities.  The service in the bar was exceptional (as is the restaurant).  Just a wonderful place to stay. "
July 2016,Harry Murray MBE,"Excellent, comfortable, and  most enjoyable stay thanks to a skilled, caring and efficient team who exceeded all our expectations. The Kipling suite is one of London's most elegant suites. The cuisine  & service for dinner in a private room was memorable "
July 2016,Excellent Everything,"Browns Hotel is everything you expect and more for a hotel in its category. A fantastic blend of classic and modern , the blend is just right. Great location, rooms and restaurant. Tentative staff but never over bearing.  I would highly recommend a stay at this hotel when in London. "
July 2016,Usual Excellent Stay,"For many yeas we have treated ourselves to an annual weekend In London and have settled on Brown's Hotel as our favourite destination.   Location cannot be beaten.  The hotel suits us.  It is not flashy and loud (like some on Park Lane I could mention) but comfortable, tasteful and discreet.   Service is outstanding. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite (Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts) which was just perfect.   We never heard any sounds from the adjoining suites.  Breakfast was delicious. "
March 2016,Best old fashioned cocktail in London ,The bar area is very cosy with nice decor and it offers really great cocktails which are beautifully presented (see photo) even though it's quite pricey- recommend the old fashion cocktail= superb! Also they offer free snacks with the drinks.
July 2016,Best hotel in london,Browns Hotel is very very special location rooms staff the afternoon. Tea is simply Perfect I can't say anything else apart from AWESOME  in every way please everyone should stay at least once to experience london at its finest ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
July 2016,Wonderful London hotel,Great hotel in fabulous location. Service is impeccable throughout the hotel. The rooms are large by London standards and are extremely clean. Beds were very comfortable and a good nights sleep was had by all. Nothing was too much trouble and housekeeping even came by to check that we were happy with the way our room had been serviced. 
July 2016,Loved Brown's!,Our family of 5 enjoyed excellent service and comfortable junior suite rooms at Brown's. The concierge service was great and we loved the location. Tea at Brown's was a highlight. Our english breakfast each morning was a perfect and convenient way to start the day. We will be back!
July 2016,great stay and location,"Had a lovely stay with my mum and 7 year old daughter. we were upgraded to a junior suite and this had ample room.  Service and staff are great efficient friendly without being intrusive.  They really went out of their way to make my little girl at home, so child friendly. Love the location and breakfast at Hix was super too."
July 2016,Great hotel,Excellent location. Generous room and bathroom size - we had a 2-bedroom classic suite. Staff were very friendly with our kids (7-9yrs old). Will be staying there again on our next trip back to london. 
July 2016,A Diamond in Mayfair,"Fantastic hotel in the Heart of Mayfair. Located in the street that runs parallel with Old Bond Street , this is a great hotel Location , amazing rooms , helpful employees and great restaurant ......this is the recommendation for Central London  A must !"
July 2016,What a place !!!,"What a fantastic place to visit. 5 of us went there As a family treat for afternoon tea & to be 1000% honest I wasn't really looking forward to it, thought it was going to be very snooty. We got there a bit early so crashed with a cocktail in the bar (Donovan's) and it was fabulous, polite people serving & attention to detail was a excellent. So so relaxing could have stayed there all afternoon but e had afternoon tea booked so in we went & I wasnt dissapointed. 5 of us there & we had more than enough food (top quality) cakes (top quality) tea (top quality) champagne (top quality) staff (fantastic) A day that I will not forget in a hurry & will definitely re visit for the next special occasion. Thanks to all the staff we met for making our visit very very special"
July 2016,afternoon tea celebration,We visited Brown's Hotel for afternoon tea to celebrate my mum's 70th birthday.  The service was impeccable. Our every need was catered for and nothing was too much trouble.  The food was of a high standard.  The English Tea Room had a wonderful atmosphere with a gentleman playing the piano to add to the occasion.  The food was replenished throughout our stay.  We were not rushed and mum was made to feel special when a personalised cake with a candle was brought over to our table during a rendition of Happy Birthday.  It was a really enjoyable afternoon.  I would definitely go back.  Thank you Brown's Hotel.
June 2016,Great Hotel with the touch of Royalty,This Hotel is nice and cozy. being a traveler on the go. i travel to a lot of places this hotel captures most of my memories with my father. we use to go there on our vacations he passed away 2 years ago but i always return to this place.
July 2016,Excellent example of a traditional London hotel,"My wife and I stayed at Browns for five nights during our recent trip to Europe. The service was excellent, friendly and personal without being stuffy or too formal. We were upgraded to a spacious suite and our room was ready for us to get some much needed sleep by only 10.00am after an overnight transatlantic flight. Definitely recommended."
July 2016,Browns,"Business trip, i have 't been there for a long time. Room look a bit old now. It looks like there is a bit less service . They still have the best London door man. One of the reason I am coming back. Best location too"
June 2016,Enjoyable Stay,"Overall, we had an enjoyable stay and would definitely consider staying at Brown's again.  The staff was friendly and courteous. The rooms were clean and well-appointed, if not extraordinary.  The location was perfect. "
June 2016,London June 2016,"We enjoyed our four day stay at Brown's very much.  The hotel staff and service are excellent.  Our one complaint was the specific location of our room which overlooked an air shaft and building AC units.  It made the rate v. overall room quality imbalanced given how much we paid.  We did not complain to the hotel as many others would have.  We did not let it ruin our trip and did not come to London to stare out the window.  The staff and service outweighed this as they provided many nice extras like bottles of water, a cake for our anniversary (after only a passing mention of the date on check in), and a difficult to get dinner booking.  They seemed to want to do more for us than we asked for from them.  Overall, I would definitely recommend Brown's for service, location and…"
May 2016,Very classy small hotel - London done right. ,"Very clean, super skilled staff, awesome food and a great London experience. Would definitely stay here again.   The room 521 was a tidy interesting room overlooking typical rooftops. The neighborhood was super convenient to high end shopping and some great restaurants. "
May 2016,Intimate hotel in wonderfully convenient location,We could not have had a better stay. The hotel staff was exceptional as was the intimate and friendly atmosphere. We also loved the location and were pleasantly surprised by how quiet the neighborhood is. We will definitely stay at Brown's on our next visit to London.
April 2016,Amazing staff,Coming to this hotel never fails to lift my spirits: the staff here are always polite and helpful. The restaurant is excellent and the bar very pleasant indeed. The rooms are spotless and incredibly comfortable. price can be high at times. But it is worth it!
May 2016,Fantastic,The staff really made us feel special during the stay. I would definitely stay again and have no hesitation recommending Browns to all. Of special note they looked after our 2 boys in a very personal way.
May 2016,"Perfectly, wonderfully, utterly British home base","Its the sort of review you put off writing as it might make it more difficult to get in. I've stayed in loads of old school established London hotels -  the Claridges, The Connaught, The Savoy, Dukes and the Goring to name but a few. Whilst they are all great in their way I always come back to Browns. As anyone knows a good hotel is really so much more than just a good bed. It is a collective of quality elements, including and especially the food. Mark Hix food is just so consistently delicious, such a a celebration of just about everything that is good and wholesome and British, right down to the gull's eggs with celery salt in season. You might even be tempted to call Brown's a brilliant dining room with a hotel attached if it weren't for the truly perfect overall English…"
May 2016,Grand hotel In the best location,Brown's hotel is a perfect location for luxury shopping In Mayfair. The staff is very professional and nice. Rooms are clean and well maintained. Old splendor with modern touch. The SPA is an oasis In busy London. Hix resturant is a nice experience with a traditional english menu (try the fish and chips!).
May 2016,Brown's is our nr 1 hotel in london.,"I actually mentioned Brown's hotel on twitter. thanking everyone. Since I myself work as an anchor woman for dutch television, it will be picked up by many. Thank you so much. My daughter and I enjoyed our stay!!"
April 2016,Quintessential London hotel!,"This is the hotel to consider amongst the others! It hits all the marks - excellent location, classic yet stylish, warmest hospitality and truly ""at-your service""! The staff is attentive and the service is on point."
May 2016,Most sophisticated ,"A reborn classic, this first hotel in London has been transformed into a chic European winner under designer Olga Polizzi. It has an elegant clientele of Euros, not young US investment bankers lugging roll-on luggage like most other once deluxe London hotels  It is without pretense but with a jumping ground floor of with-it young English designers and personalities in a Hix restaurant, sprawling library and tea room with multiple fireplaces and a chic, hopping bar serving nonstop food and drinks. Dom Ruinart is the house champagne. Enough said."
May 2016,"Stylish, expensive, English and worth every penny!",Marvellous place for Friday cocktails with my beautiful daughter. Worth every penny! Drinks are served with olives and other nibbles. I was surprised to see and hear people openly and loudly chattering on phones at the bar when the code says this is not allowed. Bad form!
June 2016,Wonderful in every way,"5 star in every way , true English style and elegance and welcoming throughout. Plus the beds are something else , and the breakfast was to die for. For anyone wanting luxury in a great location and a truly relaxed experience."
June 2016,Perfection personified,"Great location, great staff, great service, just great, great, great. Not a single flaw in service at this wonderful hotel. Cannot recommend highly enough. The hotel staff were truly impeccable -- they are all to be highly commended."
June 2016,Fabulous Stay at Brown's,We stayed at Brown's Hotel for 2 nights on a trip to Ascot.  We were looked after very well and would recommend a stay to any of our friends. The service is great and the atmosphere welcoming and sincere.  The Donovan Bar is lively and friendly and the HIX Restaurant is superb.
June 2016,Business Trip,"Excellent location and friendly helpful staff.  The standard room was very nice albeit no views.  Its and expensive stay but you do get what you pay for.  I used the gym and it was a little small, with only very standard equipment. "
June 2016,Wonderful,"Every aspect of my stay at Browns was perfect. You are made to feel so welcome, the rooms are amazing with lots of little extra touches that make you feel special. All of the staff were happy and very willing to help in anyway possible. The breakfast one of the best. Well done."
June 2016,Perfect Service,We had an event in the Brown´s Hotel and everything was perfect organized and we all had a great experience in London. We are looking forward to stay again in this beautiful located Hotel with it´s amazing services. 
June 2016,Superb hotel,Wonderful hotel with incredibly friendly efficient staff who are always will to assist with anything needed and who always provide a really personal service.  Always stay here if I get the opportunity to do so.
June 2016,Diasppointed,"We had stayed there many years ago and were looking forward to the return visit. We were very disappointed. Room was average at best, bath was nice. Service in the bar was poor. Obviously a place for the locals."
June 2016,Great experience,"My travel agent recommend the hotel and she was right! It is a very nice hotel, great staff, friendly and very attentive. It is very well located in London. I would highly recommend it and definitely come back next time in London. Thank you all for a really nice time!!!"
June 2016,London's First Hotel,Everything tip-top.  What mainly interested me was the history of the hotel (est. 1837) and the famous guests that had stayed there.  The fact that everything else was top-notch was the icing on the cake - highly recommended.  
April 2016,Perfect Afternoon Tea,"We mixed up our reservation and arrived 1h too late. This was no problem and we got seated at a nice table within perfect distance from the pianist that played nice background music. We started the tea with champagne that was delicious and choose our tea, one each. Then the food arrived, lots of it! Great sandwiches and sweet pastries. As much as you'd like. Very good service and special thanks for celebrating my husband's birthday and our one year anniversary. This was our first Afternoon Tea and we couldn't have chosen a better place for it."
April 2016,Brown's hotel Trip,"Excellent, attentive Service. Staff greeted me by name after only a few hours. The decor in my room was a little dated, but everything was functional and clean. Food quality and service in the Hotel's dining room (HIX) was very good, value for money and excellent."
April 2016,Survey,"Excellent all the way.  Second visit and I was not disappointed. Love the large bathrooms with separate shower. Preferred the REN bathroom amenities.  Rooms spacious with two beds plus a couch.  Very quiet even with room located over Dover Street. Excellent service at reception, in the restaurant, in the bar.  Well looked after by the concierge staff.  Without a doubt we will return.  "
April 2016,Second stay at Browns,"Nothing much to say, this is our second time here and we will always stay here when we come to London. This trip the hotel was a surprise for my fiance who arrived in London Saturday morning and the hotel, working with my travel agency, provided a transfer from Heathrow and went along with the rouse that we were staying at another Hotel where I had been stationed for work that week before dropping her off at Browns. The hostess in the Hix for Breakfast knew our names and drink orders after one seating, she was very pleasant. Breakfast here is one of the best breakfast's in any hotel I've stayed at in the world. The Donovan Bar is still a bit of ghost town every time we go in there, and the service has never been on the same level as the rest of the hotel, which I've written…"
April 2016,Discreet & Understated Elegance,"Wonderful ambience, charming chic & comfortable! Oozing character in a discreet & efficient manner.  Would not hesitate to stay here every time we are in London. Well situated for Green Park tube station & walking distance to Bond Street and accessible to all the main shopping areas. "
March 2016,Amazing Stay in London,This was our first trip to London and several friends had recommended (demanded) that we stay at Brown's.  Are friends were correct - from arrival to departure we has a truly first class experience.  We will definitely stay at Brown's next time we visit London!!
March 2016,Home away from home.,The hotel is located in a high valued area with friendly and experienced staff. This is a great place you need to be to reach your destinations as quickly as possible A place like Brown's hotel is very good for real relaxation. 
March 2016,Amazing Easter Afternoon Tea,"Went there for Easter afternoon tea with the family and loved it. Everything was perfect. Unlimited sandwiches and savory scones, unlimited tea, delicious cakes and friendly and impeccable staff. It was a pleasure to be there and will recommend this place to friends and family."
March 2016,Brown's - wonderful London Weekend getaway,A wonderful stay with great service from all the staff we met and a room that was just what we needed. I would definitely recommend the hotel for anyone whether for business or leisure and look forward to staying again in the future
March 2016,Champagne Brunch at Hix restaurant,"From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were met with smiling friendly personnel from the hotel, the waiting staff were exceptional from the moment we entered the restaurant we were offered a beautiful table by the window and lit the fire so it was cosy for us both, champagne was poured and our glasses topped up whilst we reviewed the menu, the food was sublime  and the unlimited champagne made our experience very special , I have been to many champagne brunches but the setting & service certainly topped Hix @ Browns hotel as my restaurant of choice and I will definitely be returning"
April 2016,A delightful home from home in Central London,"Every time I have stayed at Browns I have felt genuinely welcomed. From the Doorman who takes the trouble to get your name (if he doesnt already know it!) and then escorts you to reception where again you feel they already know you even if its a first or second visit as they clearly look through their reservations in advance (which sadly few hotels do nowadays) and at least seem to know a bit about you which is very reassuring. The two rooms that I have experienced were both a delight. The decor is modern yet very discreet and the Deluxe Kings overlooking Albermarle Street are particularly spacious with very large bathrooms with separate showers and double sinks and bags of fluffy bath towels, his and her sized bathrobes (again few hotels bother) and superb toiletries. A mini…"
April 2016,LIke getting a big warm hug,"Everytime I stay here, whether for work or leisure, I just feel so happy and warm knowing that I will have a wonderful time.  This last stay was just as amazing as always.  From the comfort of the bedroom to the mouthwatering food to the exceptional care taken by all the team... It just feels like I get a big warm hug everytime I walk in the door!"
April 2016,Amazing service at every touch!,"Previously we stayed at the Ritz. This was our first stay at Browns and hopefully not our last! A world of consistently friendly professional service was our experience at Browns. The location is ideal in lovely Mayfair.  The property is beautiful with a lovely tea room, busy bar, restaurant and spa. Our favorite pubs and Indian restaurant were right out  the door. We had a deluxe room that was extremely comfortable. The quality of the sheets is amazing. The bathroom was roomy and had a separate glass shower and soaking tub. The continental breakfast buffet was fabulous! It included fresh fruit, pastry, meats and cheeses, fish and more. This was a five star experience and we adored it! The atmosphere was welcoming and we appreciated the experience. "
March 2016,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"A wonderful hotel worthy of the the heft bill. Five star service, luxurious amenities, well equipped gym and a very helpful concierge. Breakfast was a gastronomic experience and the concierge was both knowledgeable and informative. The staff was very attentive and focused on addressing every guests concerns and needs. The hotel is well located and within walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus and countless outstanding restaurants."
April 2016,Expensive but luxurious and very welcoming,"We return regularly here as it is always a lovely place to stay, with very good, friendly service. A quick chat with John on the door is always a pleasure. Very central. The restaurant is excellent but can be very noisy when busy."
April 2016,Great Hotel & Professional Team & HIX Mayfair,"Stayed here for one night only, but had an amazing experience. Very professional check in (I think the gentleman name was Stefan), room very well designed - modern with historic touch.  Had a dinner in HIX - great food and service. To finish our evening we moved to the Donovan bar where we were greeted by Head Barman Riccardo and tried two amazing cocktails -  ""Between Heaven and Earth"" and ""The Photographer"" made by  Luca - amazing - you HAVE to try these cocktails!  Cant wait to stay here again soon!"
March 2016,A wonderful experience!,"I went here for a special birthday treat. We booked far in advance for afternoon tea and got a table near the piano and the fireplace. This was more expensive than other afternoon tea venues but I didn't feel ripped off. We have a love dark wood hotel setting, great service, and even a doggie bag of the items we didn't finish after it was refilled anyway.   It was lovely, thank you."
March 2016,A delightful place to stay,The staff are incredibly friendly and hospitable. Very well mannered and always willing to help with a problem. The rooms are comfortable and not too noisy. Good amenities and comfortable beds. Very good location and excellent bar. The Hix restaurant is a pleasure to eat at as well. Would always choose to stay here.
April 2016,"Good Hotel, almost perfect",Very satisfied except for the unbearable noise coming from the airing system which did not allow sleeping with an open window. Helpful and friendly waiters. Outstanding Concierge. Will come again but will make sure to get a better room. Avoid room on the inner court.
April 2016,Nowhere Else,I would not stay anywhere else on London. The staff are unbelievably friendly and helpful. The rooms are of a very high standard.They are modern without being chintzy. The food at Hix including breakfast is of the highest order. This is an understated hotel of the highest order. 
December 2015,A wonderful stay ,Amazing hotel very friendly with beautiful rooms.  Checkin and out very swift with attention to detail. Breakfast extremely good with many choices.  Service in bar was superb with extensive selection of gins.  Position in London great for shopping and underground. Highly recommend much preferred to Ritz. 
December 2015,Excellent service,We stayed with our twin 10 month old babies and were given a complementary upgrade to a junior suite on arrival. The suite had been prepared with toys and treats for the babies which was wonderful. The food in the Hix restaurant was excellent as always.
December 2015,West end luxury,"Fabulous place in the west end of London. Recommended if you are looking to be in the center of the west end. Service was fantastic, rooms luxurious and staff very friendly and knowledgeable. Atmosphere was relaxed luxury.  "
December 2015,A home from home,It is simply perfect staying at the Brown's. You feel so comfortable and well looked after and of course the room is sublime. I only can recommend this hotel to everyone who likes to feel save and comfortable. It is very quiet and just lovely. The staff is exceptional.
December 2015,another wonderful pre-Christmas stay at our favourite London hotel,Staying at Browns any time is wonderful but Christmas time has to be the best.  This year's decorations were stylish and sparkling as ever - very clever tie up with Fortnum and Masons just down the road.  THE most comfortable beds ever so a perfect night's sleep guaranteed every time and and as always the usual wonderful friendly welcome by everyone from the Doorman on in.  The bar was buzzing and breakfast the next morning finished off our perfect pre-Christmas treat perfectly - the burford eggs scrambled with smoked salmon on gluten free toast really was the icing on the cake - we left set up for the perfect Christmas.  Thank you Browns
December 2015,Excellent Tea,"Booked well in advance and had a most pleasant experience. There are multiple rooms used for tea all with a fine ambiance, with a piano player in residence. Seating very comfortable, noise levels fine. Firstly you have to choose the tea, large selection, then the sandwiches and pastries are brought, which are replenished on demand. Sandwiches fresh and tasty. Scones with and without sultanas with mini mince pies and a very thick curl of clotted cream with strawbery jam- very good. Pastries delicate, numerous and delicious (perhaps the blackcurrant ""Macaron"" is an acquired taste). Finally there is a choice of christmas cake or brownie mousse cake but by this stage every one is stuffed, so I would recommend moderation to get to the end. All washed down with copious tea. Perhaps…"
December 2015,"Excellent hotel, can't wait to return","Cannot fault this hotel. A great luxury hotel in a great part of London. Room and bathroom was spacious, clean, high quality- one of the best I have stayed in London. Staff are exceptionally friendly and very helpful. I cannot wait to return..."
December 2015,Our family hotel,"Booked via our Personal Concierge. Travelled with my husband and 3 daughters (13, 12, 3). Git 2 classic rooms with adjoining doors at no extra costs, Given cot, bath set and nappy change set and complimentary hit choc and biscuits for all family. Personalised ginger breads for our daughters with their names on them. Rooms clean and beautifully decorated and large. Our daughters love the hotel. My husband and I love the hotel. Location very good for shopping and Hyde Park. The hotel does valet parking. Have stayed there twice before. Would definitely stay there again."
December 2015,"Atmosphere, atmosphere, atmosphere!","The tearoom.....a must visit for those who want to experience a tradition. Sandwiches were so excellent I never got to the scones and clotted cream, not to speak of the Christmas cake that awaited. Many teas to choose from, comfy seats, waiters falling over themselves to please you. We had the last sitting which allowed us to stay at our leisure. A treat! Don't be surprised at the prices....they are high. "
December 2015,"Brown's Hotel, Mayfair, London","Brown's is a luxury heritage hotel in the heart of London steeped in history with fascinating literary connections.  It is conveniently close to parks & gardens, theatres, galleries & museums, cafes & shops, and tube stations.   It has excellent dining facilities and a well-equipped gym and spa. This hotel is very highly recommended not only for its beautiful architectural exterior and tasteful interiors but because of its tradition of providing high quality service.   Brown's should be considered for any special stays especially at Christmas time when it creates a beautiful festive atmosphere.   "
December 2015,A relaxing oasis with exquisite service!,"After an hour on the ice rink at the Winter Wonderland, Hyde Park we were in need of a cup of tea and respite! And I knew just where I wanted to go, Browns Hotel. On arrival we were greeted warmly by the doorman and taken through to the bar for tea. I might add that our party included our three year old who was equally welcomed (and given a chocolate coin by the doorman on our way out which was such a lovely touch). Our pram and coats were whisked away and we were given a wonderful table and seating area in the beautifully decorated bar. The service from all staff was exquisite and very friendly, just as I'd remembered it. My son ordered a hot chocolate (£9!! and worth every penny) and was presented with a tray of melted real chocolate, warm milk in a Turkish pot, marshmallows…"
December 2015,Outstanding ,"The English Tea Room at Browns Hotel not only captivates the quintessential English afternoon tea but serves it with tremendous style. Our waiter, Stefano, provided us with a friendly, professional high level of service that I almost forgot existed.  The gluten free option of sandwiches and cakes were by far the best I have ever had and we loved the Cornish afternoon tea blend.  Browns remains one of the best afternoon tea experiences London has to offer. A marvellous place to sit, relax and enjoy the tinkling of the ivory and a tradition that lives on with understated class in this charming establishment."
December 2015,December 2015,"Quintessential London - best in class service, wonderful rooms and excellent restaurant for breakfast and dinner. Fully recommended if you want to treat yourself and be in the thick of it all in the West End"
January 2016,The best hotel in London,"I have tried all the 5-star hotels in London and finally realized I will not stay anywhere except The Browns -- from Claridges, Four Seasons, Mandarin - this is the best.  Rita, Alistar, and Stefan ensured I stayed in my favorite room - all the rooms are spacious and luxurious - I just have a preference to a special room here.  The bathrooms are very very large with a separate shower, tub, bidet and of course, the towel warmer.  Room service is fast and friendly and food very yummy.  You cannot go wrong staying here - simply stated it is a luxury hotel experience in the best neighborhood (Mayfair) yet on a quiet street. Cheers to the staff at The Brown's!  and a big thanks for making my stay great."
January 2016,Beautiful & relaxing hotel in central London,"Browns is a beautiful hotel in the heart of Mayfair, off the beaten track and surprisingly quiet for a London hotel.  The service is excellent, staff are friendly and helpful, yet non intrusive.  I love the fact this hotel is not pretentious and all guests are treated with the same care and attention.  There is a lovely ambience in the hotel and as you step into reception you can almost feel your shoulders soften and relax after a long day in the office.  The room I stayed in was comfortable and well equipped.  My only criticism would be that the television needed upgrading and the bed was two singles joined together which was not as comfortable as a King. Despite this I had a lovely stay and the food was delicious.  I will definitely be returning in the future. "
January 2016,Pure Luxury,Browns Hotel provides a 5 star experience from the moment you check in. Staff are professional and friendly and the rooms offer a timeless elegance and comfort. The style and decor of the hotel is classic and celebrates old English Heritage. Highly recommended.
January 2016,January 2016 stay,"It was a great experience to enjoy the level of luxury that Brown's can offer. Everyone makes you feel exceptionally welcome.  The room was beautiful, the breakfast was fresh and the service was the best. "
January 2016,Best hotel in London,"A first class hotel in a fantastic location. You cannot get more centrally located. Wonderful service - all the staff were friendly not stuffy but extremely professional. In all a ,totally relaxing. It is like stepping back in time but with all modern conveniences. If you fancy being a Miss Marple this is the place for you."
December 2015,Prime location,"Well established high end hotel, well placed for London attractions, luxury shops and restaurants. Staff are trained well and are discreet and friendly without being OTT.  Room 417 was quiet and comfortable. Improvements would be to have tea making facilities in room, and the TV opposite the bed rather than under the chaise.  Nice touch to have interesting books available in the room not knackered paper backs."
December 2015,Elegant home base in the heart of London,9 days between Christmas and New Year.  Wonderful experience made better by a great staff and superb location.  Staff makes everyone feel welcomed and astonishingly almost everyone greeted me by name on every encounter.  Elegant without being at all stuffy; exceptionally high level of service without being intrusive.  One of our best meals of the trip at Hix.  
November 2015,Wonderful place to stay,"This isn't a cheap London option but it is a lovely one. The staff are friendly, the rooms sizeable, showers, beds and pillows all welcoming and gorgeous. Location is perfect and the breakfast was wonderful. If you can afford to treat yourself go for it. It is a far better option than  other more pricey options in the capital in my experience."
November 2015,Excellent stay as always!,"Flawless service. All the staff are excellent with our children. It is all the little touches- personal greeting, children's bedclothes and toys- that make staying at Browns such a pleasure. We love coming back to our London home!        "
November 2015,Elegance and Service,"A venerable, elegant hotel with a stylish, cosmopolitan air.  Superb service and staff made our stay easy and enjoyable.  Unlike many hotels at this level where a stiff formality prevails, Brown's cultivates a lively and personal touch among its staff.  Our Junior Suite was glorious, the bar was warm and festive, breakfast selection was extensive and of high quality.  I will certainly be back."
November 2015,Nothing to complain,"Luxury hotel in the west end of London. Rooms are spacious, clean, and with a lot of extras typical for Rocce Forte resorts; breakfast is delicious. I really had nothing to complain and the service team obliging. Prices are at the upper end  but given the Mayfair location not really surprising."
October 2015,English Tea,"My husband and I had a terrific afternoon at Brown's for tea. We visited London (from MA) while our son was studying abroad.  Going to a fine tea was a ""bucket list"" item for me, so I did a lot of online research about the best places to go.  Brown's did not disappoint!  The tea room was beautiful; elegant yet comfortable, not stuffy.  The staff were polite and attentive, not snobby.  (I work in the service industry so I really hate attitude from my server when I'm the paying guest).  The food was beautifully presented and offered a nice selection.  Seconds were at the ready.  It was all delicious.  I had a glass of Ruinart Champagne... Delicious (wish I could find it in the States).  Our waiter asked if we were visiting for a special event so we said yes, ""the day before was…"
November 2015,A Lovely Stay,"We had booked afternoon tea and a stay overnight. We wanted to check in early at 1215pm but our room wasn't ready. We had booked afternoon tea for 1430hrs. The reception (very busy and we had to wait !)            suggested we took tea early at 1215pm, which we did as we had a long morning attending to other business in London. The afternoon tea was delicious. We had to ask the reception if our room was ready after tea (when we arrived home we had a message from the reception on our home phone advising us that the room was ready !!!!). The room was very nice and quite. Overall a lovely English hotel with excellent staff."
November 2015,Great Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon Tea in the private Lord Byron Room, service was outstanding and staff very helpful and informative. The whole experience was lovely from the minute we walked in the door, great selection of sandwiches and cakes and more cakes, the scones were delicious to."
December 2014,Quintessental excellence in leafy Mayfair,"Took afternoon tea at Brown's and it could not have been better. Better than The Dorchester and Claridges, Brown's is in a class of its own. Set in the heart of Mayfair, from the beautiful façade to the sumptuous interiors, this place welcomes you and more. The staff are wonderfully attentive and the cuisine better than you will experience at most of London's top hotels. In short, Brown's Hotel is arguably one of London's finest and feels like a home away from home every time you visit it."
November 2015,World Class Experience,"I know its a 5 star hotel but it truly was a wonderful stay.  Every aspect of my stay was world class.  Hotel was beautiful, the staff were fantastic, the Donovan Bar bartenders and back bar staff were amazing - they are truly masters of their profession.  The food was excellent throughout my stay.  Anyone looking for a world class establishment with the budget to support should consider Brown's Hotel without hesitation."
October 2015,Boutique luxury in the heart of Mayfair,"Stayed here for the first 2 nights of a part holiday / part business trip to the UK, and can not say enough good things about this hotel. Location wise, straight forward to get to by taxi from Heathrow, easy access to local tube stations, walking distance to the shopping areas of Regent street and New Bond street, strolling access to the restaurants and bars in Mayfair, and manageable commutable times in and around the West End.  We booked a Classic Room with king size bed, which was perfect for the 2 of us. The bed is one of the most luxurious I’ve slept in, as are all the finishings and amenities in the rooms, exactly what you’d expect from a Rocco Forte hotel. The room’s are large, with a great work space area, reclining sofa, seperate wardrobe area and bathroom,. The…"
December 2015,Tea Time ,"Good was very good. The egg sandwiches were amazing. The scones were excellent. The clotted cream and strawberry jam were really fresh and good. Service impeccable as always. Very nice decoration, typical traditional English style. This is the best English tea in London. Prices are reasonable, 47£ per person and you get everything as much as you want. "
December 2015,Brown's is not a hotel,"Brown's is not a hotel but a place to stay, nearly as comfortable as home. Excellent rooms, service and food. Well located in the middle of Mayfair. Good access to local restaurants (Nopi) and theaters."
December 2015,BROWN'S HOTEL,"A marvellous stay in London thanks to the location and excellent service. We had enjoyed this beautiful hotel. It 's such a very nice pleasure to stay at the Brown's Hotel. We recommend the High Tea, in warm and cosy place."
December 2015,Increasingly elegant ,"Don Ashton, the famous hotel designer said that design doesn't make a great hotel, the guests do. Brown's luckily has both, a beautiful international clientele of what appear to be liked minded sophisticates and an evermore refined ambiance of Olga Poluzzi's wonderful textures, artwork and colors out of a lifestyle magazine vs the faux redo of pseudo-English motifs like many other luxury almost Disney theme-park properties.  It's all very comfortable with the ability to enjoy light food in the tea rooms and bar from 11-2AM, a luxurious Hix restaurant and of course excellent room service each so good you don't want to leave.  Best of all, Brown's is in the middle of Mayfair so you can walk to great restaurants and shopping, and skip the taxis.  One of the best hotels in the world."
December 2015,Be careful of your room class!,"I was not going to put anything on Tripadvior,but Browns own survey as taken me here.We booked via BA using some of our accumulated Avios points. I believe this was a mistake,as we were given the possible worst room in the hotel. 114.The room was very dark and looked over the fire escape,air con units and was in a small high sided brick yard, on the 1st floor, there was no daylight from the window as high walls surrounded the air con metal boxes outside the window. The shower was within the bath and there is a large step from and into the bath.If you are shorter than 5ft 5 then you will struggle to get in and out of shower. I would have expected a separate shower. The room was averagely fine.The TV is very small and outdated.The worst of all was the noise from the corridor…"
December 2015,Brilliant is understatement!,"One night stay as Christmas treat for wife and self. Would give 6 stars if possible. Have stayed in many 5 star places in the past on business, but none come anywhere near this place, mainly owing to brilliant service provided by staff. Greeted at door, luggage whisked to room, check in seamless and guy then escorted us to lovely room and showed us round and offered to unpack. Wife enjoyed good value massage in spar, and we had lovely lunch in Donovan's bar which was very good value. Bed turned down in evening with slippers left and face cream. Staff appeared to be everywhere and nothing too much trouble. Breakfast buffet was wonderful and almost anything available cooked to order - I had lovely fresh kippers which were a joy. We had a magical stay and are plotting to stay…"
November 2015,My favorite hotel in London ,"We love Browns because of its perfect location, its comforts and its great service. Everything in this hotel is consistent and discreet which is how we like it. Great concierge staff and lovely greeting staff at the entrance. The gentlemen who handled our luggage were super helpful. Our room was quite spacious although its difficult to get one with a view: we have stayed there over six times I think and only once ( August) did we get one Deluxe overlooking Albemarle street. The afternoon tea needs some improvement. Overall, I highly recommend it because its location is unbeatable: walking distance from all the shops, restaurants, museums, parks and theaters. "
November 2015,great repeat visit,"This is a classic establishment, providing great service and a great stay. Located in the middle of good, quality shopping and easy access to the tube. Offers a great tea room and a nice restaurant, but it is also within walking distance of other great restaurants."
November 2015,Disappointing,"There were a catalogue of small issues which, cumulatively, made the stay less than satisfactory. First, the room key wouldn't work and, since I had not been accompanied to the room, I had to go back down to reception to get one which did work. Then, I had specifically asked to have my luggage to be brought to the room quickly, because I had to change for an appointment and was running late. Nobody brought it and, after 20 minutes or so, I ended up going back down to reception to fetch it myself. I found it lying unattended  on the floor. Nobody would have known it was mine, but nobody said a thing when I picked it up and walked off with it, and nobody later queried whether it had gone missing. I was asked, when I checked in, whether I wanted a newspaper in the morning. I said…"
November 2015,Fantastic balance of heritage yet in the moment,"This hotel is a gem:  small, private and inspiring.  Everything from the bar, the breakfast room, the in-room dining, the intimate lobby, reception with a fire place... staying here is to share and to be part of building the hotel's history and future.  Inspiring renovation.  Excellent bed.  Excellent pillows, bathroom amenities, real Italian-style enormous wooden clothes hangers, black out curtains, minibar assortment.  Just waiting to meet Agatha Christie in one of the corridors...  Love it.  Will definitely be back.  Feel very well rested."
July 2015,A wonderful afternoon tea,"A return visit to Browns of Mayfair for my husband and myself and in the company of Australian friends for their first visit.  A wonderful array of teas from which to choose and for one, vegetarian sandwiches, replenished immediately and just at the right time, our lovely warm scones with strawberry jam and clotted cream.   The savoury delights were just right and we each enjoyed a glass of champagne to make the afternoon extra special.  Staff here are always welcoming and attentive and we love the gesture of two small bags of our chosen teas to take away with us.   Our friends were charmed.  Highly recommended."
July 2015,Wonderful hotel,Had a great experience at your hotel!   Wonderful staff!!!  Great location to walk to everything!!!   Would highly recommend the browns !!!   Will be back soon!!!  Thank you and your great staff for a great experience !!!
August 2015,What an experience,"We went to Brown's for afternoon tea and what an experience it was. Haven't been to many five star hotels to compare it with but boy do they do service, friendliness and attention.  Our waitress was looking after two tables and was hugely attentive and  provided brilliant service. But, not only that she was very welcoming and friendly, really interested in us and also gave a little of herself discussing her native Italy. She was excellent We then went into the bar and the same can be said of the staff there, really good service and welcoming. A special mention too to the head doorman who greeted us like a long lost friend Brown's also has a great feel about it, traditional, mature and comfortable. I guess all this is what you pay for! We've had more flavoursome afternoon teas…"
August 2015,Amazing Browns,"I was a bit dubious about staying here.  Not because its the oldest hotel in London or because it looks quite fancy (I've stayed in plenty of those) but because I was under the impression that it was a bit ""up itself"".  I could not have been more wrong! Browns is a wonderful hotel, homely and charming with wondrous staff who simply cannot do enough for you during your stay.  We were given a couple of nights bed and breakfast by a friend and had sort of put off the visit, choosing the seemingly less intimidating One Aldwych or The Metropolitan on trips to London but the voucher end date was coming close and we really didn't want to waste them.    From the moment I contacted the hotel to book, they could not have been more helpful Joana and Francisca on reservations were very…"
September 2014,An institution in St-James,"I have been since 15 years. I like the location and the dual entrance. You can walk to hyde park, do shopping and go to piccadilly /Soho in the evening. The room are quiet and with full amenities. excellent service. Tea-time is an institution here and you need to book during the Weekend."
July 2015,Great Afternoon Tea,We had high tea at this Hotel and it was fantastic. We made a mistake and made the booking for the day before and the staff were very helpful and were able to seat us very quickly despite use mixing up the dates. The food was high quality and very filling. We had a great afternoon tea. 
July 2015,Intimate setting.  Attentive service.,"On a quiet street, within walking distance to the finest shopping and attractions in London.  Feels like a large, private home, offering exceedingly warm, yet unobtrusive service. Room service arrives quickly, and is served beautifully.  A true English classic.       "
July 2015,Quintessential Brown's Hotel,Excellent location in Mayfair with some of the most friendly and helpful staff I have come across in a hotel.  The bar is lively and does great cocktails and I would also recommend Hix for lunch or dinner. 
July 2015,Outstanding in every way!,"Our experience couldn't have been any better! From start to finish the food, service and general experience was of a very high standard. The room was spotless and had a great view over Dover St and we were given a fantastic upgrade which was much appreciated. I'd highly recommend this hotel to anyone."
August 2015,Fantabulous service...,"I've never waited for an ironing board less time...the service is really quite exceptional...ironing board on....the rooms are spacious and appointed in a sophisticated way.   The location is  great for London visits and getting to and from the City.  All the rooms are different and they are helpful for making changes....I'm an a/c freak, Browns gets a top score for getting the room ice box cold.   With this hotel you get what you pay for."
March 2015,I Love This Hotel,I absolutely love this hotel.  I am in London frequently and have stayed at many hotels there.  This is one of my favorites.  The location is perfect....unless you are trying not to shop.  This is right in the heart of all the shopping on Bond Street and walking distance to Piccadilly and Oxford Street....but on a quiet street away from the hustle and bustle.  The service was excellent.  Everyone knows your name within a few minutes and they bend over backwards to make you feel like you are at home with the added benefits of room service.  Tea here is one of the best in town and the rooms are lovely with the feel of an apartment rather than a standard nondescript hotel room.
September 2015,Certainly Not a 5 Star,"Stayed at this hotel but to my dismay found the Room Attendants running around like headless chicken looking for fresh linen, pillow cases and towels. Seemed like this hotel has lost its way . This is not the reflection on Room attendants but the management . I would never have expected a 5Star hotel not to have adequate supply of fresh linen, pillow cases and fresh towels. I know for sure that this was not a one off event as I noticed this everyday over  a period of 6days . Shame on Rocke Forte group of hotels."
March 2015,Always great,"I love Brown's!  I've stayed several times, the discrete Mayfair location is absolutely fabulous, the service is excellent all around (OK maybe a bit disorganized at breakfast) and the rooms are elegant.  I had a nice snack in the bar and lovely breakfasts in the dining room.  Thanks everyone, I'll be back!"
October 2015,Perfect Business hotel in central London,"I stayed at the Brown's for business I had to conduct in central London. The location is perfect as very close to Green Park station but also a bit away from the madness! The hotel is beautiful, the rooms gorgeous and it is very quiet as opposed to what I feared. I slept so well, and the breakfast was gorgeous."
October 2015,Serene,We normally stay around the corner at the Westbury but decided to try this for a change. Upon arrival we were whisked away to reception and the bags taken from us immediately. The service was excellent from start to end apart from missing doormen from time to time. The rooms are a good size and immaculately decorated. The cooked breakfast is also very tasty. You also notice how much less hectic it is compared to the Westbury. Will definitely stay here again if the chance arises.  
August 2015,Understated elegance,We stumbled upon this place for mid afternoon lunch fortunately for us they had two spare tables. I would imagine that booking would be essential for afternoon tea. I have looked at the photos of this hotel professional and fellow trip advisors and to be honest; they don't do it justice.  In reality it is a place where funk crosses elegant comfort. The staff are attentive enough without being too fussy. It has a lovely relaxing feel to it and is a welcome relief from the busy hussel bussell outside in near by new bond and regent streets. The food available was a good range high price end as one would expect in Mayfair. I looked into the bar which exuded atmosphere and I will definitely return for drinks mid shopping trip.
October 2015,Brown's Hotel London,"Simply faultless. Definitely the best hotel in London. A country house hotel in Mayfair. Wonderful guys there for who nothing is too much trouble. The chefs even did an ensuite dinner for us that was way off the menu.Also very quiet at night. I will recommend it to anyone , and now won't stay anywhere else.              "
September 2015,Lovely atmosphere and location in Mayfair ,"Service is as you could expect in a top 5*hotel and you feel welcomed. Location is, if Mayfair is your destination, perfect! The rooms are delicate and the J suite spacious. If the temperature could have been lowered a bit in the room (some one turned the air conditioning off, before I return for the night) my sleep would have been perfect to. But it's definitely a hotel that I will return to. "
October 2015,Afternoon tea,"A real treat in a lovely setting  Very unstuffy service in the English tea room - lovely sandwiches - nice cakes, great earl grey tea. Only one downside  was a Victoria sponge that was burnt . Would go again but I pass on the spongee ne  that was Byrne  downside was "
October 2015,Too early? Too short!,"Arrived at short notice without a hotel and Brown's was available - what a gorgeous place to stay. Room wasn't ready (no surprise, the hotel was fully booked the night before) but I was seated in the cosy tea-room, and before I had finished my breakfast, the room was ready."
October 2015,Centrally located,"Central location great for shopping or hopping on the Tube. Very friendly staff. We had high tea in the restaurant, which was a great experience - they had a wonderful selection of teas. We stayed in a junior suite and found the accommodations to be quite enjoyable."
December 2015,Nice Hotel,"Full of tradition and a great welcome . Was somewhat disappointed with the room, nothing special and quite expensive for what it is, in fact a little tired in the bathroom. The bar was excellent with a good selection of drinks and food.  Great location, hence the price."
December 2015,Christmas Tea,"Had a wonderful Christmas Tea. Brown's Hotel is a London landmark. Impeccable service with attention to all the details. The atmosphere is sophisticated yet family friendly. The quality of the tea (finger sandwiches, scones and sweets) was exceptional.  Highly recommend! "
December 2015,Fabulous Browns Hotel,Beautiful quality hotel with an air of class set in a fabulous part of London. Well situated for fine shopping and dining. Staff courteous and welcoming at all time. Will Be returning to this hotel sometime soon. Five star.
December 2015,Classy Hotel,"Birthday lunch for two, early December.  Can't wait to return and stay over.  For me its all about style, ambience and service [good but not fussy], food comes second.  The trip began with a magical cab ride through Mayfair - this has got to be the best area to visit at ths time of year.  Claridges, which I almost booked looked spectacular.  Brown's however did not disappoint.  I'm a fan of the Endsleigh and Tresanton and although I was aware of the connection I didn't expect this hotel to feel quite so intimate and exclusive on arrival.  After an hour we reluctantly swapped the Donovan Bar for the dining room where the excellent service continued.  Highlights of the meal included the soda bread, the sides [delicious mash and creamed spinach] and the Sancere.  Prepare yourself…"
December 2015,Best location in London,Brown's is a legendary hotel in the best location in London. The staff and management are outstandingly helpful and friendly and go out of their way to make you comfortable. I cannot recommend the hotel more highly! Sebastian Taylor
December 2015,Fantastic 50th Birthday Celebration,"Fantastic team made our friends 50th Birthday extra special.   From the point of arrival and being greeted by the doorman, to a relaxed drink in the bar and then an exquisite meal at Hix - the entire evening, service and food was faultless. Nothing was too much trouble.  If you want somewhere extra special then this is the place to go! "
November 2015,perfection,"all aspects top notch. casual , understated luxury. simply wonderful.  feels like a home away from home. staff excellent.  extremely impressed with room, service , restaurants, bar, room service and facilities ( gym ). "
December 2015,Once again another perfect stay,"This was our second stay at Browns and we thoroughly enjoyed it. From the well appointed room, huge bathroom, quiet but central location, high level of service,  a lovely ambient bar, and the perfect breakfast, we couldn't have had a more perfect stay.  We will definitely stay here next time we are in town."
April 2015,Wonderful Anniversary Micro Break,"My husband and I stayed here to celebrate our wedding anniversary, a one night micro break!  The hotel staff were fantastic from start to finish.  When booking we mentioned we had stayed at Brown's for the first night of our honeymoon, 6 years ago and they couldn't have been more accommodating at having us back!   On arrival the door man greeted me by name (very slick!) reception staff were charming, we had a huge upgraded room, complimentary champagne and rose petals on our bed in the evening!  Superb customer service!   The bar is great for a pre dinner drink, really buzzy but intimate to get you in the mood on a Friday evening.  We shall definitely be returning for another anniversary micro break in April 2016! "
July 2015,Afternoon tea,"Afternoon tea treat for my husband. A delicious selection of sandwiches and sweets. The scones are delicately soft and chewy. The staff are attentive and kind. Slightly disappointed in other ""guests"" not making an effort to dress smartly. One person in a hoodie and another in tatty jeans and trainers! Come on people. Give afternoon tea the credit it deserves.  Tea at Browns was a lovely experience that I would highly recommend!"
July 2015,Perfect,"Absolutely first class experience from check-in to (reluctant) check-out.  Browns is the friendliest and most efficient hotel at which we have ever stayed in London, and its location could not be surpassed for our particular requirements.        "
July 2015,"Browns Hotel, Mayfair",Browns meets all 5 star expectations and the location is excellent. The breakfast offering is a delight and the table service first thing in the morning is a great way to start the day. It makes a difference when key staff know your name and greet you with it every time.        
July 2015,Perfect hotel... and keeps getting better and better!,"This was my third time at Brown's with my family for a relatively long stay (about 15 nights) and I have to say this excellent hotel keeps getting better and better! Rooms are spacious and the decor is extremely pleasant - classic with some modern touches. All rooms I have stayed so far looked like brand new, recently refurbished. Location is perfect for tourism or business. Therefore, in terms of the physical aspects of the hotel, Brown's is clearly a 10! It deserves to be mentioned that the hotel prepared some nice touches for the kids - books, toys, special bed linen, everything specially designed for kids. Even a special ginger biscuit with my son's name on it was there waiting for us! However, the real difference you feel in the hotel services. The staff is AMAZING! Doormen…"
July 2015,A lovely stay,"I have stayed at this hotel previously but not for a couple of years and it was great to go back.  My wife and I arrived on a very wet Friday night to be met by the very friendly doorman who has been working at Browns for years. We had booked an Executive Room for two nights and we were upgraded to a Junior Suite, which was lovely. My only criticisms was that drinks in the hotel are exorbitant for example for a jug of Pimm's & Lemonade I was charged £96.  My wife and I also ate in the hotel restaurant Hix on the Saturday night and we both had a very disappointing meal not helped by the restaurant Manager who had attitude and reminded me of the lead actor in Faulty Towers having a rude moment with customers, perhaps dealing with customers is not his strong point and he needs to…"
January 2015,Wow!,If you are looking for a hotel in London I defiantly suggest Browns hotel. Here's why first of all the service is splendid. They are so kind to everyone and it is a great hotel for grown ups and children. When we came back to the hotel they had baked ginger bread cookies with our names on them. They also have a library and more. The rooms are great perfect for a stay in London. I recommend Browns hotel for sure.
July 2015,Old school charm,I have only ever used the bar here but the staff are great such a friendly escape from the hustle and bustle  It's a great place to meet people have a nice drink I must allow more time to go to the restaurant next visit
July 2015,Wonderful hotel!,"This is a wonderful hotel in the heart of Mayfair. Great service, nicely decorated and superb experience! We decided to stay here as we also had a similiar experience in Berlin at Hotel Rome. Don't miss!       "
December 2014,Classic character downstairs upstairs a surprise!,"I have put off writing this review to try to consider my feelings which are mixed. We have known the pubic areas of Brown's for many years and consider it a favourite in London for afternoon tea, Brunch, a drink or a pop in. The staff and service is superb. We stayed a couple of nights last December as a surprise for my husband's 60th birthday. The downstairs stuff was divine as ever including afternoon tea with surprise guests and brunch with more. I was terribly disappointed with the room though. It was huge which was great and the bathroom was also large and well appointed, But it was horribly over-modernised and corporate and frankly reminded me in style of a Premier Inn which was so different to the lovely clubby wooden traditional feel of downstairs that it was a shock.…"
June 2015,When only the best will do.,"Browns Hotel in Mayfair reaches that level. From the time you walk in the front door until you leave, you are treated as someone special. Nothing is too much trouble.  Share that special moment at the Hotel they will not let you down.       "
September 2015,Want to be pampered?  Stay at Brown's!,A fabulous romantic retreat with wonderful service and exceptional staff! Nothing was too much trouble and we were made to feel so welcome.  I would whole-heartedly recommend this as a place to stay if you want a treat!              
October 2015,MARAVILLOSO!!! Outstanding service!!,"We stayed for our second honeymoon for 4 nights, everything was excellent starting from service, details, crew attention, food, and LOCATION! It is near everything you want to visit and crew sent us every night to the best restaurants at walking distance. Very nice experience 👍"
October 2015,Low key,"Small, low key, great location, good service. I have stayed here before but didn't appreciate it as much. Probably my top pick in Mayfair--no bling, simple. Room was reasonable size with a very good bathroom. Espresso machine in room would be welcome. B&O TV should be replaced with a newer Samsung that swivels. House keeping did a sloppy job initially but management addressed the issue immediately and gave me a free upgrade."
September 2015,Out of this world,Brown's Hotel offers something different than other hotels in London -peace and tranquility but only 2 minutes away from all the action! The staff are amazing and nothing is too much trouble. I adore breakfast in the restaurant every time I visit. After a visit to the theatre we always go to Donavan's bar in the hotel and can not praise the staff enough. Already planning my next visit.
September 2015,Perfect location,Loved the Hotel. Staff were excellent and provided a faultless service. The building itself was stylish and well appointed. Breaks at was good and the staff in the bar very helpful. Would happily stay again.
April 2015,Our first Afternoon Tea experience could not have been better,"Me and my friends visited Browns on my trip to London during Easter Holidays and as this was our first time experiencing genuine English Afternoon Tea and we were very pleased of our choice of place. We opted for their Tea-Tox Afternoon Tea menu, which seemed interesting. When we requested staff for re-fill of sandwiches, they told as that at that moment kitchen was making new Tea-Tox sandwiches but they could bring us the regular sandwiches and some traditional scones in addition and of course we were happy to try them as well. Also, staff was kind enough to suggest if we would like to try a different type of tea (and of course we were not hard to persuade) ;): Only one hick-up during our setting was that, i guess we over stay our booking little bit and we were kind of…"
July 2015,A great place to stay in london,"Great location, great food and accommodation. We really enjoyed our stay at Brown's. The staff were very friendly and helpful and we will definitely go back to Brown's. The hotel is near a myriad of great restaurants and shops."
September 2015,Outstanding/pristine hotel for short ( or even long ) business trips,"Nothing else except that this is a true gem in Mayfair. Great team of staff, made my stay very enjoyable. Very central location, ideal for visiting London. Will visit again. The beds were so comfortable I felt like I was on a cloud. Nice breakfast selection too."
September 2015,Excellent Location Great Hotel,"Stayed in this hotel twice with family great service comfortabl rooms excellent location near to best store resturant very distinguished location. Rooms are decorated elegantly very well maintained clean spacious bathroom shower and bath tub included. Rooms get prepared for night as well.  Breakfast is rich satisfying and delgious. Specially if you get English breakfast. Very close to Bond street , Picadilly street, Ragent street, and Oxford street. It is at cross road. Walking distance to all of the above. Room service is fast and friendly. At the door they are very helpful to find taxi. Good concierge service ."
July 2015,Exquisite,"You know you are at a premium hotel in Mayfair when the porter brings up your bags and says, ""Would you like me to unpack for you, Madame?""  The level of service; the location; and the demeanor and attention of the staff at Brown's cannot be exceeded. I had the full English breakfasts each day, tea in the afternoon, and lunch one day as well during my stay. All were terrific. The neighborhood is fun for walking and window shopping, but mostly, it was the graciousness of the staff and the hotel itself that I loved so much.  I have to confess, I wish they had not updated the rooms to the very modern '70's retro. The washroom was wonderful, but the decorating in the bedrooms is not to my taste anymore. I loved the timeless, old world, traditional antiques and am afraid this new…"
July 2015,wonderful hotel,"My wife and I experienced a wonderful stay at Brown's Hotel. As I heve been satying at Brown's for more then 40 Years It is allways a place where I feel coming back home. The only downside ist the outdated air conditioning system in the guetsroom. It can not be adjusted properly -  a strong draft flows troughout the room - therefore I did catch a cold after the third night. Unfortunately windows can not be opened. And if, you are faced with the steet noise ! "
June 2015,Best of the Best,"We just completed our second stay in less than a month. Superb service, excellent food, classic England comes to life. The concierge can make almost anything happen and the bellmen and valets provide a one of a kind service. Our rooms were well appointed and very quiet. We have stayed here in the past and will always stay here in the future. Central location to everything you want to do. "
June 2015,charming and well located,"We just spent about a week at Brown's. Service was impeccable. The concierges are fantastic and pleasant. The bar/tea room was quaint and lovely. You could navigate from the hotel and do quite a lot without even having to take the ""tube"". Breakfast buffet was very nice in the HIX restaurant. I would stay away from having a real meal in the restaurant though as we found the food mediocre and expensive. Our room was spacious and had a very large bathroom with two sinks and a shelf to set up private toilet articles. Sadly the room was not as ""charming"" as I had hoped and was a bit ""motel like"" in decoration. Nice touch: a series of interesting books in the room! Great shoe shine service free of charge. Not sure what other rooms were like. We had a day and a half without the…"
July 2015,Disappointing High Tea,"We went to Brown's with high expectations for a truly authentic and stunning London High Tea experience.  All started off well, and fell apart as the experience continued.  We paid for an upcharge for a champagne tea for two. After our cake was served, we were left alone for half an hour with dirty plates on our table that we had not touched for that half hour, as well as empty tea pots and champagne glasses.  Finally, when the manager came by to ask if everything was OK, we explained the situation.  She offered a glass of champagne in their bar as compensation which we declined.  We were supposed to receive large macaroons (2) to take away if we desired.  Finally they brought one small cookie in a box for us to take away.  The manager took 25% off the bill.  Even if she had not…"
June 2015,Amazing !,Amazing stay at Brown's - went back for first time since our wedding night 15 years previous and were made to feel so welcome and at ease by all the staff. A special mention must go to Bonnie who treated us to a gift in recognition of our celebration - Brown's are lucky to have an employee who recognises the importance of such gestures in this day and age.
May 2015,"Genuinely kind, competent service and all-around excellence","We experienced some of the best service we have had, _ever_, at Brown's. The genuinely friendly, kind, and competent staff made us feel welcome, and really went out of their way to make sure that we were comfortable and had any help that we needed.  Just a few examples of the non-standard, beyond-the-call-of-duty service we received: 1. Massive help receiving and forwarding luggage (from other hotels, and to our home in a different country); 2. Extreme kindness when I was felled by a massive migraine on the day of our departure (and felt so unwell that we needed to stay another night); 3. Stepping out into the street (from the front desk) to make sure we didn't lose our way; 4. Locating speciality shops for us (we were shopping for a wedding gift for a dear friend and wanted…"
June 2015,Return to Browns,"We absolutely appreciate this wonderful hotel. We do, however, find it a bit unusual that having shown such loyalty to the Rocce Forte brand, we do  not seem to be shown any real recognition in return. Who else from Australia has stayed at Browns, Balmoral, Verdura and Hotel de Rome?"
June 2015,Decadent afternoon treat,"Organised birthday trip for my partner which included afternoon tea at the English tea rooms at Browns. Did a bit of research and it was widely acclaimed in the telegraph afternoon teas review so thought we'd give it a go.  You need to book in advance as this is a bucket list the of visit, also don't be put off by the dress code email either, it is smart but casual and rightly so but certainly not trainers and football shirt!!!! The staff are extremely courteous and helpful and the choice of teas and cakes is wonderful. You pay for what you get and at Browns you get culture, good food, ambience and style and for a once in a lifetime treat you need to go for it !!!"
July 2014,One of my Favorites ,Browns hotel is for sure one of my favorite hotels. The service is fantastic. As soon as I entered the room there were gingerbread cookies and hot milk at the side of my bed. Everyone there was very helpful and kind. The hotel is built and a great location close to lots of landmarks. 
June 2015,Room with a view,"Well I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with my recent stay here  I've known of Browns for many years and have always avoided staying but got stuck due to the availability of other hotels   What a really nice hotel, feels a bit like a boutique as opposed to part of a chain was also really pleased to find it wasn't as stuffy as I thought and unlike the Mayfair wasn't full of Russian business men   The rooms are smaller than places like the landmark but it's very refreshing to be able to go shopping and be able to drop bags back at the hotel within a few minutes walk   I would recommend this for romance or shopping "
May 2015,The essential London!,The Brown's Hotel is quintessential London. It does not have a herd mentality or the snobbery found at many chain 4 and 5 star hotels. There is a personal touch to everything they do there. The location could not be any better. It is now my absolute favorite hotel in London. Impeccable hospitality and attention to detail no matter now large or small the issue.
November 2014,Best Hotel,"I stayed in this hotel twice and I plan on staying there again, as I visit London more frequently to view houses for when I move there in August. The Lobby is really pretty and the rooms are stunning as well. It also has a restaurant, which gives you the full London experience"
May 2015,No. 1 Hotel in London for us,"My Husband & I stayed at Browns Hotel in London for 2 nights over the Bank Holiday weekend.  This was a gift to us for our Ruby Wedding Anniversary.  The Hotel upgraded us to a Junior Suite which was amazing.  We sat over breakfast on our last morning trying to think of one negative point about this Hotel & its Staff.  There was NOTHING we could think of. The place and its Staff were immaculate with nothing out of place.  This being the sort of Hotel that’s really out of our league we thought we might be out of our depth but every member of Staff were kind, courteous & helpful.  They made us feel so welcome.  Every little thing to make our stay enjoyable was done with the minimum of fuss.  It is in the perfect spot to explore the West End of London.  If you are staying in London…"
May 2015,London Experience,The Browns Hotel is everything you imagine when you think about London! Excelent service and location!! Friendly and  professional staff and in the heart of Mayfair.  My favourite hotel in London so far.              
May 2015,"True English hospitality , staff that aim to exceed your expectations & a fine five stars accommodation",The staff & management are the key factor for making my staying as pleasant as it was .. the way they look after details really impressed me. The accommodation itself was nice. The attitude of the hotel exceeded my expectation .. they offered many complementary things .  Love the hotel & love the staff  
May 2015,Browns hotel London's luxury friendly,"I stayed here recently on business and it was a 5 star luxury experience without the unfriendly staff you can often encounter in premium hotel properties. The location is perfect, staff wonderful and food was delicious. The bar is also a cool little hideaway perfect for important but intimate business meetings or drinks with friends.       "
May 2015,Very British and stylish in London,"A true taste English culture ! Located in Mayfair, and just moments away from the famed Bond Street boutiques, Dover Street Market. I very much enjoy the Rocco Forte collection hotels especially for their elegance; modernity and style. the room was perfect with Wi-Fi, interactive entertainment, iPod docking stations as well as bathrooms in Bush hammered limestone and more... The service is indeed outstanding. Must try the traditional tea experience...so British !! and Mark Hix restaurant that cooks a perfect modern British cuisine."
May 2015,London Hotels at their best,"A lovely stay at Brown's - intimate top class hotel, Arriving was perfect and no hassle with the Doorman taking care of our car. Gorgeous room and service as always was exceptional. Professional but personal service and a stunning building and location thank you       "
April 2015,I was robbed,"I was robbed by the house keeper, and the manager in duty failed to help me and there was no cameras in my room corridor to proof that happened, as it was a do not disturb sign and she still went in the room while I was in the shower."
August 2014,Magnificent !!,"This lovely old establishment is so British traditional. You truly taste the culture of England.  From the beautifully appointed rooms, luxury sheeting. Very comfy beds.  The in room menu typifies famous British culinary delights. Location ! Its right in the middle of everything. Mayfair. You can walk to any top restaurant, attractions and Famous Parks. The shopping in Bond street is not for the 'faint hearted'. If you appreciate the finer things in life then 'Browns' is your destination hotel in London and also because it is boutique , it is private and luxurious. they attend to your every whim!..  We always stay when travelling to London."
July 2014,A Favourite,"Brown's Hotel is a favourite in London for location (convenient to tube, Fortnum and Mason and restaurants), service (classic and just the kind I like without being over the top) and I enjoy the 24 hour fitness gym (some hotels have huge gyms that are not open when one needs them to be or that are pushy with time-wasting - and money wasting - spa services but this is just the basics but well maintained. Restaurant is decent and I've enjoyed some classics including grouse, good Burgundy and more. Also enjoy walking in and out of the Royal Academy because of the changing nature of the place."
June 2015,Visit to London,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to London.  The Brown's Hotel was so welcoming.  We have stayed in London before, but The Brown's Hotel was the best.  The room was so comfortable.  The hotel is newly remodeled and the attention to detail is so very thoughtful.  We were warmly greeted by George upon arrival with a handshake.  And he was always available at the front door to welcome us.  Givi was friendly and took care of our luggage and was there to help us as well.  The concierge recommended wonderful restaurants for dining and took care of our reservations.  We also enjoyed the young man at Donovan's Bar and I regret to have forgotten his name.  I hope his back has gotten better.  But he will prepare the finest cocktails to your liking.  The entire staff at The Brown's was…"
June 2015,Loved,I was staying at this hotel for a Louis Vuitton advent in new Bond Street it was a 2min walk. This hotel is so central you can walk to everything. I just loved this hotel I have stayed many times in London but this is the best hotel the staff are so so helpful and friendly they go out of there way to help you. I also had breakfast which was very good I loved the orange juice it was so good better the Florida !! I really can't wait to go back. Thank you for looking after me x
June 2015,Business & Pleasure,Had a wonder four-day stay combining business and pleasure. Everything was top notch for business and very welcoming for my family. Thank you to everyone we encountered at Brown's. We will be back...!       
June 2015,Gluten free afternoon tea,Upon arrival we received a warm welcome directing us to the very glamorous English Tea Room. We were shown to our table and sandwiches and pastries were brought out with a our selected tea - most delicious gluten free food including scones - great way to spend the afternoon :)
May 2015,"Matchless Charm, Gorgeous Decor and Wonderful Staff. Browns is unique.","I arrived a couple of hours earlier than my wife and was immediately greeted by Johnny who opened the taxi door and took my luggage. It almost seems telepathic, the staff's uncanny ability to know your name as soon as you enter this beautiful Hotel. Johny was an absolute gentleman and he set the tone for what was to be a memorable two night stay. What is so special about this hotel is that it is not simply a case of one or two highly trained and motivated members of staff making up for the apathy of others, you often meet in other, less memorable hotels. At Browns, they are all incredibly professional, charming and helpful and the main thing that sets them apart from other establishments, is that they manage such high levels of service without being stuffy or superior. It is as…"
June 2015,Green Park Grandeur,A haven of calm behind Picadilly to repair to and relax. Tried this for the first time for a weekend break in London and was not disappointed. Bedroom and Bathroom were excellent although for me the bed was too soft so ask for a board if you dont like soft beds! (One was offered when I mentioned this on my departure. In room dining and restaurant were superlative.
June 2015,excellent review,"I think that Brown's provides quality service with an attentive staff who are most helpful and pleasant. The porters are terrific, and the various concierges are responsive and eager to help. I am always eager to return.                     "
July 2014,Timeless classic,When you walk into Browns you automatically feel apart of history.  I did visit many years ago. And feel in love with this hotel. The history itself dates back many hundred years. The food is out of this world. The atmosher is simply great.  A must visit for people who deserve the best. 
June 2015,Modern charm,"I was a guest originally over 30 years ago and had fond memories. I was not disappointed to revisit. Mayfair is the place to be and Browns remains the place to stay. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have experienced. This is a classy, timeless hotel."
February 2015,Fantastic stay!,"My husband surprised me with a trip to London for Valentine's day and it has been one of the best get aways I've had in a long time. Right in the heart of Mayfair, the surroundings were beautiful as well as the hotel itself. The staff were extremely friendly and eager to make our stay as enjoyable and comfortable as possible. The room was superb. Spacious and beautifully decorated. Had everything and more that we could possibly have needed. It was a very enjoyable stay. The next day we had afternoon tea in the hotel which was excellent. Brilliant value for money and will definitely recommend to anyone. My husband and I will most definitely be returning and already looking forward to it."
February 2015,a night in town,an exceptional friendly and professional welcome was extended from everyone.   incomparable  service  housekeeping  prompt and good delivery of our breakfast  next time we'll stay for afternoon tea Thank you
February 2015,Exceptional hotel,I recently spent 3 nights as this hotel on business. Exceptional service and beautiful rooms. I only tried the restaurant for breakfast and totally enjoyed the choice and food. Donavans Bar was a great place to meet up with colleagues and had a great atmosphere and drink choices. I'll judge all other hotel stays by my stay at Brown's.
February 2015,Perfect!,"Recently stayed at Browns for business. The location is perfect and the staff were accommodating and helpful. My room faced the road, but I could not hear any noise at all.  The room was lovely and felt ""homey"". I fully recommend a stay for business or pleasure."
February 2015,Exceptional Hotel in Perfect Location,"I recently spent three nights at the Browns Hotel Mayfair and could not find fault in the standard of accommodation, service, and location. The perfect hotel for business or pleasure.   The rooms are classic in style, spacious and have all the modern conveniences a business traveller requires.   A visit to the Donovan Bar is a must for a great cocktail. "
February 2015,Perfect old-style service and politeness,"Although Brown's has had a modern make-over - in terms of the bedrooms and some of the artwork (!), the great aspect of this old hotel is still the fantastic service from all the staff. Everyone from the doorman, reception to restaurant and bar serving staff were very professional, friendly and polite in that wonderful proper English way - not over the top or fake, just what you'd expect from a top class hotel in Mayfair. Just for info - our room was on the 5th floor but we could still clearly hear the party-goers outside on the street at the early hours of Sun morning. Food for breakfast was really good with large helpings and the bar staff were really friendly. Some of the finishes in the bedroom (window blinds) are showing signs of wear-n-tear but room was very comfortable…"
February 2015,A great experience at The Brown's !,"My wife and I spent 2 incredible nights at The Brown's. Everything was perfect, the smiling service, the very nice and comfortable room, the large and warm bathroom, the excellent food we had either for breakfast and dinner and the great location, just to mention a few oustanding peculiarities of this nice property !"
February 2015,Afternoon Tea,"In case you would like to experience the classic afternoon tea in London, that's the place to go.  The ambiance of the Brown's hotel is pretty classic and  the service is great. The sandwiches, scones, pastries and cakes are all deliciouse , as well as champagne. Regarding the tea, I would suggest you to try the Brown's Afternnon Blend , really tasty and rich. However make sure to book ahead, as closer to the date , many spots might not be available."
February 2015,Perfect Afternoon Tea,"To Brown's for our latest Afternoon Tea in London - and I must say this was probably overall the best we've been to. The usual sandwich and cram tea/cake selection boosted by an excellent selection of ""designer"" teas which offered a flavour range to suit all. Very good, understated service by the Brown's team and all in lovely, old school luxury surroundings. Thoroughly recommended"
February 2015,Excellent on all levels,"From the minute we arrived everyone was friendly and efficient,checking was a breeze & the luggage was bought to the room almost immediately. Afternoon tea is a must do at this hotel,everything from the sandwiches,patisserie & scones were excellent.The breakfast was also very enjoyable & nothing was too much trouble much better than some similar hotels we have experienced.Location was ideal for what we had planned ( Theatre & some sightseeing) & everytime we walked through the entrance were greeted by very friendly colleagues.Having stayed at the Rosewood last time we were in London we found the whole experience far superior at Browns,would return without hesitation."
September 2014,Best in London,"In all my years traveling to London both for personal and work reasons, this special place has become my home away from home. Every last detail is executed with perfection. It is a beautiful place to wake up each morning and truly the best of the best in my opinion. Everything you could want is steps away and what's more, Hix, is just inside and this restaurant delivers an incredible culinary experience surrounded by a fantastically curated art collection. I will never stay anywhere else when in London! "
November 2014,Great Classic hotel In London,"Great hotel, excellent location. One of the best hotel services in London. Classic, upscale but with a family atmosphere. Roos, restaurant and tea room were in line with our high expectations. Not the first time we've been there, but that was longtime ago."
November 2014,Fabulous hotel on a perfect location,"Stayed in this hotel with my partner for four nights. The room was stylish decorated with plenty of space. The staff was very friendly and helpfull. This hotel has the most comfortable beds I've slept in in a hotel.  Only point of attention is the noise of the hotel, you can hear people walking through the corridor when you're in the bathroom and I heard several times noise from above. Nothing really bad, just an old building in the perfect Mayfair district."
September 2014,Great location and outstanding service,"My wife and I were in London for a week and though many times before this was our first time at Brown's. It exceeded our expectations and we plan to return in the Spring, All our needs were met and the concierge went out of his way to help with touring and financial arrangements."
November 2014,Exceptional Service,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Browns Hotel.  We were well looked after and definitely will come back.  We have stayed in many of the ""top"" hotels in London, but the service we had a Browns exceeded the level of service we have had in any other London hotel.    There was nothing we could fault with the hotel.  The service and the quality of the food served in the bar was excellent - so good we went twice in 1 day.    The breakfast was also top quality -  loving the pancakes and bacon which was of similar standards to that of Sarabeth's in New York.  Will definitely be the hotel of choice from now on in London.    If you are thinking of staying in Claridges, The Ritz or The Dorchester, give Browns a try, you will not be disappointed.       Fantastic location for shopping with…"
April 2014,Good location,If you need to stay in Mayfair it's a great spot. I found the rooms a bit confusing. They weren't really quaint and not at all modern. Somewhere lost in the middle. While I wouldn't hesitate to return I might not recommend it without reservation.
October 2014,Quintessentially London,"Having stayed in numerous hotels in London, including the Dorchester and Claridges, we have settled into our London ""home"" of Browns.  Whilst the other hotels have their positives, they are all very large properties, and it is easy to get lost amongst the other guests. i.e. service is not so great at times.  Browns is a much smaller hotel, with a very personal and homely feel about it. Breakfast at Hix is fantastic, a great selection of produce and quality.  The hotel is quite often frequented by royals, who like to keep a low profile. The GM, Stuart Johnson, is an absolute professional and as you would expect, a proper Brit.  Highly recommended."
November 2014,Excellent hotel!,"We had great experience at Brown's for my husband's B-day. We just had Afternoon tea with waiter Stefano. He is super super good, simply the best! Always smiling and friendly. The suite we have got was amazing. Very professional staff. The bartender Agnez was very friendly and helpful. Good location. We will definitely come back."
November 2014,A delightful place to stay,"Had afternoon tea and then stayed for one night. Tea was superb, particularly the healthy option. The room and the ensuite were charming, quiet and spacious although we would have preferred a separate shower rather than one over the bath. The public rooms, including the bar, were cosy rather than grand and the whole effect was one of homeliness. The service, helpfulness and friendliness of the staff were exemplary and they did all they could to make us feel ""at home"". We would happily return for that special occasion."
September 2014,Celebration Tea,"We celebrated our daughter's 18th birthday with Afternoon Tea. The occasion more than lived up to the high standards we hoped for and expected. The Tea was excellent (of course), the pace was relaxed, the service was exemplary and the whole event was topped off by a thoughtful 'birthday cake', complete with 'Happy 18th' in chocolate written on the plate. Our daughter was extremely pleased and it made the day.  Definitely a highly enjoyable and memorable experience - which was the whole point."
January 2015,"OK, But There Are Better Places To Stay In London","A difficult review to write as Trip Advisor does not have a good rating. I would not rate  the hotel as very good ,hence the average rating.Check in was fine and there was a pleasant doorman to greet us.We had booked a classic room which was clean and comfortable but very basic and small with that view, as some others have commented on ,to  a cold looking courtyard and air conditioning vents, as the manager states in other reviews, 60% do not have that view ,not much consolation if you are in one of the remaining 40% .The room did not have tea and coffee making facilities ,but this was remedied when I expressed surprise and a tray was brought up to the room .There was no complementary water in the room ,which I would expect from a hotel of this class. The bed was comfortable…"
January 2015,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed at this hotel with my family and was awesome. Super clean, large room, staff very welcoming and warm. Brilliant location, few strolls away of everything. Delightful ambience and tasty breakfast full of everything you may need in the morning. Recommended 100%."
January 2015,Super Hotel,"Brown's made London even more fun than it already is. The service was impeccable at all levels. If something didn't work, such as a movie, they credited it immediately. Friendly and knowledgable, all our questions were answered with a smile. Johnny, one of the doormen, was fantastic."
March 2014,Perfect London stay,"The weather was awful but the hotel was fantastic. Very clean room, spacious bathroom, top amenities and very good range of food and drinks. We loved everything about our stay, once we tried the spa which was nothing wow, but quite ok, slightly on the pricey side."
January 2015,"SUPERB, SUPERB, SUPERB","Check-in such a nice, easy ,smooth, smiling process what a pleasure. Rooms are cosy , not over the top but tend to give a home away from home feeling. Spa treatments incredible, even though the spa is very small the therapists are extremely well trained.  Concierge tries to accomodate complicated requests with ease. Breakfast was good, would encourage the maitre d' to less brusque but maybe that comes with his territory.    Loication seconds away from Bond Street ."
January 2015,A whole new meaning to excellence ...,"Last weekend I had the privilege of staying at Browns.. Having just arrived back from a two week trip in Thailand where luxury is considered common place, my family and I took a short stay up in London to visit the theatre and museums. First question; where to stay? Browns was the answer... What a treat on every level...I was reminded  of what true excellence is. The moment we arrived on the door step we were greeted with a welcome that was stunningly professional but at the same time warm and  friendly. Then we were shown, to the reception,  around the hotel, up to the room and then to the restaurant. I can honestly say I have never, in a single hotel, experienced true excellence in every area quite like this. There is normally one or two things that can ever so slightly taint…"
December 2014,Outstanding,"I am going to keep this short and sweet. Browns is exceptional in every way.   The rooms, the food, the staff, the location.    It's a superb luxury 5 star experience. Certainly, the best london hotel we have ever had the pleasure of staying in.   So in a word, faultless."
January 2015,A truly excellent hotel.,"A superb experience from the moment we were greeted by the doorman 'til the moment we left. All the staff young and old present as courteous, professional with even the youngest displaying a level of confidence rarely seen. If I have any criticism at all it would be to provide Nespresso machines or similar in the rooms, coffee sachets do no favours to such an illustrious hotel! We will return and would happily recommend this hotel to anyone looking for understated luxury in the heart of Mayfair."
December 2014,Excellent Hotel in Mayfair,"Our family of five enjoyed a wonderful stay at Brown's Hotel over Christmas and New Year's 2014. We had two deluxe rooms next door to each other. The children were so spoiled! Cookies and milk everyday. Over Christmas the hotel delivered embroidered stockings filled with goodies for each child.   Adults also enjoyed the gorgeous, comfortable room (everything recently renovated.) We received a complimentary bottle of champagne our first night.   The breakfast everyday at Hix was excellent. We also enjoyed tea at the hotel and a lovely hotel lunch one day.  The concierge was incredibly helpful with reservations at restaurants and even helped us get transportation to the Harry Potter studio.   Overall, excellent hotel; excellent location;  excellent service. Will definitely stay…"
January 2015,A 7 star service with a Smile!,"We often travel to London, yet this was our very first time at the Rocco Forte Brown's Hotel.  This place could not fault in any way, thanks to its brilliant position, its ""British-Italian"" atmosphere and moreover thanks to its well trained, professional, courteous and always smiling staff.  Our overall experience at the Brown's hotel made our last trip to London a very special one and can not wait to be back.  Hats off to all...from the Island of Malta."
August 2014,"So British, so personal","Browns hotel is a favorite in London. Perfect location, welcoming staff, stylish decorated and a georgeous breakfast. I do think the standard rooms are a bit too small for the price though and some with a pretty bad view."
September 2013,Excellent service...and their lattes are THE BEST,"I stayed here with my husband and our three kids.  We were able to get adjoining rooms, which we were thrilled to stay in an older historic hotel and still have adjoining rooms.  This hotel is centrally located, and is really quite nice.  The service is impeccable and the rooms were spacious and very clean.  The breakfast buffet was great with a variety of options for my kids and the lattes in the morning were some of the best I'd ever had.  Maybe it was the jet lag, but I'd go back just for the latte!"
August 2014,"Afternoon Tea, good but not great","Afternoon Tea is one of my real favourite treats & having tried many establishments in London and the home counties I feel that I can honestly report that although this was good, it really was not great & I have had better especially for the price!  The beautiful lounge area, split into three rooms with the pianist is unsurpassable. Spotless crisp linen, ticking every box visually. We had comfortable armchairs by the fireplace, but you may want to ask for a higher table as some are low coffee table styles & sofas which some people would not find easily accessible or comfortable.   There was a lovely welcome and the staff are all delightful. My friend treated me for my Birthday and we had chosen Browns specifically. The sandwiches are all freshly made and yes you can have more…"
August 2014,Fantastic Hotel,We stayed at hotel for 3 nights on a family vacation and the stay was great. The service at the hotel was outstanding. The location was perfect and it was truly enjoyed by the whole family. Keep up the great work!
August 2014,Cosy and central located hotel in London.,"We stayed there 4 days. The hotel lies centrally in Mayfair, so due to dense traffic the taxi ride was about 45 min from the Eurostar station. It lies within walking distance of most shopping areas,historical landmarks and museums. Welcoming doormen and staff, reception lies at the end of the corridor. Check in was fast, we had luxury rooms. Rooms were not shown. Entrance of the rooms was with cardkeys,one to open door  another to put electricity on. The rooms were relatively large,one had inner courtyard view,the other view of Albemarle Street. Rooms have several windows,the one with inner courtyard view faces large walls of the tiny courtyard with on the ground large ventilation tubes somewhat masked by green vegetation in pots, the other one faced the roofs of surroundings.…"
August 2014,Classic Elegance in heart of London,"I have just stayed at Browns Hotel on Albemarle Street in Mayfair for two nights). I was fortunate enough to be in a Junior Suite, which was extremely spacious and beautifully decorated. Upon arrival, there was a tray of petit fours, a fruit basket, bottles of highland water and a bottle of chilled white wine (always a good start!). The staff were particularly attentive (not always the case in 5* hotels) and could not have done more; I would particularly like to single out Stella and Lewis on Reception, James and John on the Concierge Desk and the very tall waiter at breakfast. The air of understated elegance pervades throughout the hotel and guests' requests are met efficiently and timely. The hotel is also in one of the best locations possible in London - in the heart of…"
July 2014,Classy but unpretentious and friendly,"We had wanted to stay at Brown's for a number of years and in particular to have their much praised afternoon tea. My wife' special birthday gave us the excuse to book. Having made the booking we then angst a little on what to wear for afternoon tea and a dinner in Hix Mayfair, and weren't sure if we were going to feel underdressed or out of place. We needn't have worried on both counts as there was a mix of casual and smart dress and from the moment we arrived and jumped out of our cab all the staff were most welcoming and from the start made us feel at home.  Afternoon tea was the quintessential English experience that other reviews have summed up so well. Service was attentive and informative and an afternoon of gentle enjoyment of teas, sandwiches and fine cakes is not to be…"
August 2014,Classy but pricey Mayfair institution,"Everything about Brown's is effortless. This is a confident 5 star establishment that knows its place in firmament of traditional London Hotels. Unlike places like the Ritz its not full of flash wannabes. It just oozes class and sophistication and has an easy charm that comes with confidence in everything they do. Location is second to none. If you choose to stay in a 5 star hotel, in the most expensive part of the most expensive city in Europe you know there will be a commensurate price tag. And it can be eye watering. Not helped by the fact that a service charge is added to everything it seems. I'd say the only minor disappointment is the Hix restaurant. In truth the food is average and a bit staid but you'll pay Michelin Star prices."
July 2014,"An oasis of peace, serenity & luxurious Class !","Brown's Hotel in the heart of Mayfair provided 5 star opulence balanced with friendly, professional staff. We had 2 nights in the hotel , everything from checking in to collecting our bags on departure was handled with great care. We visited with our 12 year old Daughter & 8 year old son, we enjoyed uninterrupted sleep on both nights ( a first for us in a City Hotel )! Having been fortunate to have stayed in most of the capitals top hotels, I feel that Brown's has hit the perfect balance. Congratulations to the management & staff."
July 2014,Excellent but...........,"I want to give this place 5 stars but I cannot.  Overall, this is a classy hotel with excellent service throughout.  Our room was well appointed and very comfortable.  BUT, for the price, there were several flaws.  The TV was old and the channel choices were not as extensive as they should have been.  WIFI service from the desk are of the room was fine but from the bed area it was not nearly what it should have been.  Thus, if you wished to use your IPAD or phone from bed, it was a problem.  Also, there was no coffee maker in the room.  I would certainly stay here again but only if these issues had been addressed.  Overall, I still have to say it is a wonderful hotel."
November 2014,Great stay at a chilled hotel in a great location,"Excellent hotel, chilled out and friendly, but with great service. The suite we had was fab, clean and very well laid out. Breakfast seems to be an institution, but Monday to Friday the restaurant is busy with suits rather than residents and as is the bast which gets very busy a the end of the day. Overall a great hotel, superb location and very good staff, the gins and cocktails are pretty good too!"
October 2014,Tea at the Browns,"Had tea at the Browns Hotel. Nice and relaxing experience. Great Service and good quality food.  Would not necessarily go again since there are better places for tea (check the Lanesborough which, for me, is on top of the list)"
November 2014,Wonderful stay,"Stayed here for one night on my birthday last week. A fabulous stay from arrival to departure. All the staff were so friendly and helpful and we were lucky to have our room upgraded which was a very pleasant surprise. An executive room certainly fitted the occasion and was extremely comfortable especially the large bed with lovely crisp bedding and the bathroom was of a good size too. Breakfast was excellent and the choice superb….wanted it all! Although we didn't partake in full afternoon tea as we had dinner booked for later, the tea and scones were wonderful and the scones very fresh and warm. Thankyou Brown's for a wonderful stay and look forward to returning."
November 2014,"Great location, very nice hotel","We stayed in an Executive room for a couple of nights.  The room was nicely furnished and both it and the bathroom were very spacious by London standards. All staff with whom we interacted provided excellent service.  Breakfast was very good, both in variety and quality.  Two minor things stopped the experience being perfect for me, but I accept that these are completely subjective:  1) I like my rooms to be totally dark, but the curtains let in too much morning light. 2) The mattress was too soft - I like a firm bed.  Overall, however, we had a very enjoyable stay and I would be happy to recommend this hotel."
November 2014,A bit of class,"Afternoon tea at Browns was delightful. The building is traditional with décor to match. All the staff we spoke with were helpful, polite and friendly. The food; a selection of sandwiches, cakes and cream scones  was fresh and very tasty. A piping hot pot of tea was most welcome after walking around town. Definitely one to visit when in London."
November 2014,"Unique, elegant and impeccable service but Donovan bar getting busy and noisy","Brown's is the best hotel I have never stayed at, but I am a habitué at the Donovan Bar and it has become my de rigeur social meeting point when I am visiting London over the last 5 years or more and my premier entertaining bar of choice.   I can truly say I have never had a bad service experience at Browns and one cannot fail to be impressed with the standards and excellence displayed by the staff. The ultra professional greeting staff at the door manage to combine olde worlde formality with informal friendliness, impeccable manners and helpfulness and they set the standard for the hotel as soon as you arrive.   Everyone I have ever invited to the hotel for cocktails, drinks or dinner at Hix has relished the atmosphere, service levels and ambience of Browns and I've recommended…"
November 2014,Fabulous location and attention to detail,We stayed for one night at Brown's as we had to be in London to see clients.  Our experience was wonderful.  Upon check in we were upgraded to a superior room (I had read somewhere that this is more likely to happen if you book directly with the hotel rather than through a 'broker' website - and that seemed to pay off!)  The room was wonderful and the REN toiletries and selection of options in the mini bar were excellent. It was a Friday afternoon and the hotel bar was heaving - so we had afternoon tea and that was wonderful.   Great service and scones to die for! I was excited to see the water put out from us was from Blenheim Palace where we had been the week before!!  When we came to check out the following morning we saw a member of staff in the corridor who wished us a good…
September 2014,Excellent service in the cocktail bar,We arrived at Browns after a truly appalling experience at the Ritz Hotel Rivoli Bar.  (See separate review).   The manager and staff were welcoming and most efficient.  The manager quickly found us a secluded area to sit and our order was taken without fuss.  All in all an enjoyable experience
November 2014,The staff make it great!,"We have just spent 4 nights at Browns Hotel in a larger room on the 1st floor on the 'courtyard' side.  There was nothing to look at but some potted hedge plants but there was enough natural light and the huge advantage of a very quiet night.  The rooms are well tarted up and functional with everything you would expect bar tea/coffee making facilities. A great and proper hairdryer rather than one of those horrible wall mounted things though no plug in the bathroom as is standard in the UK and good lighting, makeup mirror, easy operating phone and TV etc.  Would love a bit more hanging space but there is a chest of drawers in the small wardrobe.  Bearing in mind this venerable old lady is just that, old, there are the obligatory squeaks and rattles and some sad paintwork on the…"
November 2014,Afternoon Tea - Very Refined...,"Usual fare for an afternoon tea, and the plates were refilled as often as we asked for them to be, so we left feeling very adequately fed and watered.  My tea was absolutely delicious (Cornish blend), and the staff's attentiveness was spot on for me.  The pianist was really really good - I was entranced by his range of music, and it added a lovely twist to the afternoon.  Highly recommended, and a lot of other people clearly thought so too, as they were full."
September 2013,A tea session in Brown's is a real cultural experience,"I liked this place very much! A tea session here is a really joyful gastronomic and cultural experience that will make you learn and understand more about the tea as such and about the afternoon tea tradition. This is the right place to meet your friends, business partners and family! You can bring anybody here, it will satisfy all tastes, from the simple and modest ones - because they're discreet, they don't ""attack"" with too obvious luxuries, it's an understated refinement - to the most sophisticated - because behind this discretion everything, from the decoration and service to the tea and the food, is the finest English aristocratic taste and tradition. It has some intellectual atmosphere too. It is expensive, but the experience is worth of it!"
January 2014,Still not my London hotel...,"Over the past few years, my wife and I have attempted to find the perfect hotel in London. Well, this is still not it... Don't get me wrong, the Brown's is a nice hotel. But not perfect...   Our room, a Deluxe, was large by London standard. It was also well decorated and appointed. However, the air conditioning system basically had you choose between off - with a resulting unbearable heat in the room (in January!) - or on, which was fine, except for the jet turbine noise it was producing all night. Also, the TV was a small, first gen LCD, probably dating from the early 90s.  Service was a bit lacking, with us attempting three times to book a massage at the spa before finally succeeding.   On a more positive note, the location is fantastic.  To conclude, the Brown is a nice…"
January 2014,Amazing gem of a hotel,"Stayed at Brown's on NYE. Left for another hotel on new years day. Hated it so re booked back to browns. The service is impeccable, under stated pure class. It's not cheap but you get what you pay for. Mega thanks to Johnny the doorman for finding us a cab in the pouring rain on the morning of new years day and for walking us to it carrying his trusty umbrella! We had lunch two breakfasts and one dinner. The food is amazing. The rooms we had were both stunning and the beds to die for..so if you want to stay where you feel like family go to browns. If you want to stay were you feel like a paying guest? Stay somewhere else!"
December 2013,Superb Service,"Superb service and personal attention. My 7 year old loved the kids VIP card and the nightie cookie and gingerbread man - great attention to detail to make this a memorable stay for the hildren and not just the adult.  Very comfy rooms, good breakfast, exemplar and personalised service by the whole team from Doorman to Duty manager.  Still one of London;s best hotels"
December 2013,Made Christmas Magical,"Leaving our tradition of staying home in San Antonio for an international destination was not easy. Although no one balked at the idea of visiting London for Christmas, we wanted to make sure that the venue was one that would be well remembered. Having stayed at the Rocco Forte in Florence and Rome, we had a feeling that the Brown's could meet our intentions. What we weren't expecting, was a facility and staff that set this magnificent hotel apart from its Italian siblings.  From the moment we arrived, Samantha and the front desk staff went out of their way to assure our accommodations met our expectations. As each day went by, the staff took extra time to not only assure the quality of experience but they went out of the way to truly get to know our family. Whether in the…"
December 2013,An almost faultless stay,"We really enjoyed our stay at Browns in the Hellenic suite.  The suite was lovely and very quiet.  I provided feedback at the time - we had our two year old daughter with us and I commented that some books in the suite for her would have been good.  On checking out reception informed us that they had a children's library - it would have been good to know that on arrival!  Otherwise, service was excellent.  Food was very good - we ate breakfasts and dined in our room in the evening (because we had our toddler with us).  Concierge and restaurant staff were excellent.  I had a massage in the spa which was also very good - part of our package.  Location is fantastic and there are plenty of good restaurants nearby if you don't want to eat in the hotel. We tried the famous afternoon…"
December 2013,World-class afternoon tea,"We are a couple who love afternoon tea and visited Brown's on Christmas Day as a special treat.  They put on a special Christmas champagne afternoon tea at £60 with turkey & cranberry sandwiches, mini mince pies with cranberry scones, and festive themed cakes & pastries.  It was an absolute delight from the moment we walked through the door.  We had what we thought was the best table - two lovely big arm chairs right in front of an open fire, beautifully decorated for Christmas.  The staff were so warm, friendly and attentive.  I would highly recommend it and can't wait to go back."
December 2013,Another  wonderful pre-Christmas stay at Browns,We had another really special pre-Christmas stay at Browns on the 19th December - something of a tradition now and the perfect start to Christmas.  Stunning festive decorations inside and out  - I think by Lulu Guiness this year - it was its usual stylish fun place to be.  Every table was full with people enjoying a leisurely champagne tea when we arrived - we went straight for the champagne without the tea this time as we were having dinner in the Hix Restaurant with friends.  The room was spotless as always and they really are the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in.  From the super helpful friendly doorman on in all the staff were really helpful and pleasant.  Dinner in the Hix was a huge treat - super fresh ingredients and really reasonable prices for the quality and…
January 2013,We loved it,"We stayed at the Brown's in December 2012 and January 2013 for 3 and 4 nights.  Everything in the hotel is great, from its perfect location in Mayfair to the rooms (the first one was typically English style, the second one was more modern in the last floor). The staff was very nice and the restaurants were excellent. The afternoon tea is one of the best in London.  To summarize, the Brown's is a pure luxury London hotel which has been successfully refurbished in order to respect its long history while satisfying the most demanding modern guests."
September 2013,"Splendid Service, Classic Experience","Brown's Hotel was a wonderful place to stay when we visited London this September.  The staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were updated and spotless, albeit not overly spacious. Breakfast was very nice, with a wide selection. The location was excellent.  We will definitely return on our next trip to London!"
October 2014,Afternoon tea at Brown's,"I had afternoon tea here a few days ago, for a friend's 40th birthday and it was absolutely lovely.  They catered very well for vegetarians, and also took into account that I can't eat tomatoes or hazelnuts.  The service was fantastic, and even though it's obviously a very well-to-do place, they were still friendly and personable.  My friend had a great time, and we all had a great afternoon.  Lovely sandwiches (though I do wonder what they do with all the crusts?!), yummy scones, and petite cakes that were gorgeous.  Everything was well presented, a large selection of teas to choose from, and we left feeling very satisfied."
August 2014,Nice Way to End a Cruise!,Brown is a charming hotel centrally located in London. We found their staff to be very friendly and competent.  Enjoying afternoon tea at Brown is a beautiful way to experience  British tradition.  I would have liked our room to have been more traditional in keeping with the rest of Brown's ambiance.
September 2014,Wonderful stay in London!,We have returned to Brown's for one night or several days and never disappointed. We are usually upgraded and the staff is exceptional.  The location is central in London and wonderful just to take a walk around even after dinner.  The food at Brown's in delicious and the  tea time a must. I look forward to our next stay at Brown's.
September 2014,Excellent Service!,"We stayed one night celebrating our wedding anniversary and i must say this has been one of the best hotels i have stayed in London. On arrival we were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to a suit! On return from our dinner we were even more surprised when the room was nicely decorated with rose petals which just top off what was a fantastic day for us! The location was brilliant, we walked everywhere we needed, the staff were friendly, helpful and warm. The breakfast was amazing and i have been dreaming about it ever since! All in all, ill give this more than an excellent if there was such a rating! Will surely return!"
September 2014,Afternoon Tea - how it ought to be,"Just wonderful, from the food to the pianist. Just the right ambiance, refined and understated. I'm British but if I were a foreign tourist, I'd be delighted by the 'Britishness' of this place.  Fabulous sandwiches, small cakes, way too many scones (they brought five scones per person. Yes, five). Ample amount of Cornish clotted cream, and a choice of two cakes from the trolley. Food replenished discreetly, not that it's really required after all of that!  Definitely better than the afternoon tea I've had at Fortnum and Mason, just because it's cosier. The only thing I didn't like was that the chairs are very low - I prefer to eat at a normal height table; but it's no problem really."
September 2014,Recent stay at Brown's,"We just stayed 6 nights at Brown's.  The location is excellent, very close to Green Park, Green Park tube station, many art galleries and the fabulous shops on Bond Street and the surrounding back streets.  This was a very comfortable stay - the staff are very discrete, welcoming and unpretencious.  Afternoon tea with our friends was excellent, as always.  It's also very secure with footmen on the front door and 2 or 3 security guys on the back.  The food in the attached HIX Restaurant was very good, but there are many fabulous restaurants within a very short walking distance.  I was a bit disappointed with the executive level room that I booked - smaller than I had expected for the price and in need of an update compared to other hotels of this standard around the world.  I…"
September 2014,Exceptional service even better food.,"I held 2 training days here and the service was exceptional, really personalised. The refreshments were always on time and hot. The food was amazing, tasty, hot, cooked to perfection. I will be visiting here again for social as well as arranging further training here. "
September 2014,Consistently excellent,"I have stayed at Brown's hotel multiple times over the last year both for business and with family.  The experience is consistently excellent.  The rooms are very pleasant, boutique hotel rooms.  Good mid-size gym with plenty of equipment.  Outstanding restaurant.  The service is always first rate.  The concierge, front desk and outside staff go out of their way to be helpful under all sorts of conditions.  I highly recommend this hotel which is in a great location near Piccadilly Circus."
December 2013,Private room for afternoon tea,"Booked a private room for my two sons 13th birthdays. We booked over the internet, as we are from New Zealand and it was no hassle. It was an amazing birthday treat for them, the service was excellent and the food just kept coming. Replenishing our sandwiches and cakes all the time. The food was top notch and nice a fresh. Thanks for helping make such great memories."
September 2014,Afternoon tea,"Expensive, but exceptionally impressive. First class service, truly one hundred percent attentive staff. Comfortable decor , good variety and endless supply of sandwiches and cakes all accompanied by pianist tinkling away on the ivories. Can't wait to return   "
March 2014,Birthday Weekend Away,"I can not express how amazing Brown's hotel is, from the minute of checking inn, the staff had such a friendly and professional welcome for us,  i took my partner away for his birthday and upon entering our room we were pleasantly surprised with a beautiful chocolate birthday cake and bottle of bubbly chilled, the room was a perfect size and was just like being at home.  The concierge staff helped me with picking out nice restaurants and pubs in the area. The in room dining was so tasty and the staff very efficient.  All smiles from everyone and never did you feel out of place in any area of the hotel, Amazing location, great price and just a perfect weekend. Thank you for bringing back the friendly and caring hospitality to what it should be."
March 2014,"Great hotel , great room ..... Terrible noise intrusion","What a fantastic location , easy access to west end shopping and restaurants and a fantastic atmosphere within the hotel , BUT oh room 206 ..... Under no circumstances accept this room on a sat night as you will hear , cars screeching , police sirens , drunken folk from the Dover st wine bar into the wee hours .... Such terrible awful noise , no double glazing and endless all night long loud traffic noise and shouting ... You have been warned !   Otherwise great hotel , superb restaurant , buzzy bar .... as ever though almost impossible to make ones self understood by room service ... Breakfast arrived in duplicate but hey .... Was too tired after the worst night s sleep in a 5 star for many a year !"
February 2014,afternoon tea,"four of us went here for a 60th birthday celebration, it was casual dress but smart. The setting was exactly the same very casual with settees and big comfy arm chairs. There was a good variety of sandwiches that kept being replemished as soon as the plate was empty. Then came the mini scones warm with cream and jam yum yum, then victoria sponge of coffee cake, to be followed by more mini cake selections, Tea to drink until you could drink no more, by the time we left we where stuffed to the brim. Staff where good and there for every little whim you may have. We have visted the ritz but preferred the relaxed atmosphere at Browns. Just be wary their is a 20% service charge included in the bill."
January 2014,Another wonderful stay,"We are never disappointed by this hotel.  Fabulous rooms, happy and helpful staff and the most comfortable beds.  Everything is immaculate with great attention to detail, can't recommend this hotel enough."
December 2013,You can't knock it,"We stayed over Christmas at this, my mother-in-law's favourite London hotel. The service as always was excellent, our rooms, spacious, comfortable and bright. Afternoon tea in our room was a joy and dinner in the restaurant impeccable. You pay a lot of money to stay at Brown's, but you know you can expect excellent, professional standards in everything they offer - we are never disappointed when we choose this hotel. Stay here, you will not be disappointed."
January 2014,"Lovely, however","We stayed at Browns for the first time for my husband's birthday. The hotel is very start, the staff are extremely professional, as you would expect,  in particular John the doorman.  The evening ""turn- down"" service made us smile- slippers placed on a sheet, eye gel on the pillow etc. The bed was so comfortable but unfortunately we were kept awake from 5:30 as a result of a party in a nearby room. The night staff were aware of this because they delivered room service on several occasions but didn't appear to be concerned about the music & loud noise. The staff delivering the party food & drink spoke at normal volume even apologising to the party room because they'd had a delay in service! When we we t for breakfast the music was still on & I told reception at check-out. Johan…"
January 2014,Homely Luxury in English Tradition,"Good to finally check out London’s oldest 5-star hotel.  Behind old facades are modern rooms all luxuriously appointed, very spacious, and designed with attention to details. Above all the atmosphere is very homely, very English, with impeccable service. Rocco Forte is one of my most respected names in hotels and great that each hotel has its own individuality and character. I had stayed at Frankfurt and Florence years ago and when I checked in at Brown’s the reception had all my details including even my preferred newspaper.  The dining breakfast is very good with an extensive menu including an interesting Indian course.  A most pleasant stay right in city centre."
January 2014,really nice hortel in perfect location,"We have tried many hotels in London and we found the one suited to our tastes. We stayed for two nights in a standard room : very big for London, tastefully decorated with such a comfy large bed and a very nice big bathroom. Our room was also very quiet but with a view on the backyard (maybe not the best view but as a result, not a noise in the morning).  The breakfast was really good (try the hot chocolate and you wont have to have lunch afterwards!). The staff was charming and for us, had just the right attitude : smily, friendly and helpful. And of course, you cant beat the location : everything is in walking distance. We will go back."
January 2014,Still a first class Hotel Bar,"Donovan Bar is a bar that when we come to London, we always pop in for a couple of drinks. Great service in this long establish hotel. Maybe slightly pricier than other Park Lane Hotel bars. We always sit at the bar and chat to great bar staff."
December 2013,Wonderful Experience!,"Brown's is a boutique hotel with older architecture and more modern furnishings.  A really nice combination of the two!  The rooms are very large and nicely appointed.  Service was wonderful too.  The breakfast is servied in Hix Restaurant which is lovely.  The Bar is also spacious and modern if looking for an afternoon drink or cup of tea.  We did not go for High Tea although it seemed like it would have been a real experience!  The hotel is very well located near the Tube, high-end shopping and walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and many other sights.  We had a wonderful experience and wouldn't hesitate to go back!"
May 2014,Birthday treat,"Having reached a special birthday I decided to celebrate by having a special afternoon with a friend. This was our first visit and first impressions were of a wonderful intimate room for afternoon tea with wonderful attention by all the staff. Nothing was too much trouble as we were plied with a delicious selection of sandwiches , tiny warm scones with clotted cream and home made jam followed by tiny cakes and a piece of Victoria sandwich or cherry and almond tart. We were offered many pots of tea - white nettle and many refills of the different food. It may seem expensive but is value for money when considering the amount of food on offer. Despite the menu stating that our table was available for 90 minutes, we were allowed to stay an hour longer without any pressure to leave.…"
May 2014,Lovely hotel with even lovelier staff!,"We had the pleasure of staying here for one night this weekend - our first visit to Browns.  Our welcome was great - excellent concierge who introduced himself to us(George) and good check in. We were taken to our room and left to settle into our Executive room. We then realised we were overlooking the inner workings of the hotel which was pretty grim. We asked to move and decided to upgrade to a more expensive Deluxe room (205) for a street outlook. It was great with plenty of light/windows. However we were a little disappointed (hence the 4 star and not 5) as on their web it says we would have a double sink, separate shower and walk in wardrobe. We didn't have any of those and the shower was not great and water was only warm not hot - bathroom needed an upgrade we thought. Bed…"
May 2014,First class in every way,"My daughter and I have just had one night at Brown's Hotel and could not fault our stay.  From arrival to departure with a wonderful afternoon tea inbetween everything was perfect....truly first class in every way.  The staff were so welcoming, warm and friendly and nothing was too much trouble.  It really was a wonderful experience."
April 2014,Class Act,"Great location in central London. A London treasure.  You feel like you've been transported to another time....wonderful service from the entire staff.  The bar at the Hotel is wonderful and very comfortable, the restaurant at the Hotel has very fine food and a top notch breakfast that is equally efficient (buffet available) and high quality.  The room we had was very large and well appointed, we had a large walk-in closet and a room layout that made it seem like a one bedroom apartment.  The bathroom was large and very well appointed with towel warmer and beautiful clean lines (rare for such an old and grand hotel).  All in all, a treat. Brown's Hotel was a big part of our wonderful trip to London."
April 2014,Old School Class,I had the fortunate pleasure of staying at browns and relishing the old schol charm and art of serivice and hospitaility very hard to find these days. From the doorman to the chambermaid all our there to help make your life easier and smoother. Location is right bang in the centre of where you want to be in London. Great stay...
April 2014,Superb Lunch with friends.,"Friends staying here and visited for lunch. It was very good indeed. Love the new makeover, much brighter and fresher.  Terrific service from the landmark hotel and well cooked food, will return soon as told the sunday lunch is the best at the moment in London"
December 2013,Amazing afternoon tea!!!!!!,"We had read some of the reviews of afternoon tea and they were right - it is amazing!!!!!!!!!  We were seated near the fireplace and found the food, ambience and staff just amazing!!!  The food was unlimited and they were more than happy to cater for vegetarians and gluten free.  The minute we finished a plate we were offered another - non stop!!!  The selection of teas was amazing - staff were happy to let us try many different varieties.  We were there for over two hours - we never felt rushed at any stage.  There was a piano playing in the background which added to the atmosphere - to say we were impressed was an understatement!!!  Best afternoon tea we have ever experienced.  Highly recommended!!!"
March 2014,Consistently good ,"Stayed at Browns twice in March and was again very pleased with service from the front door to the bar, lounge and restaurant. However choice of rooms is key and even the slightest upgrade produces better results. Smaller internal rooms are to be avoided particularly for a weary traveller with too much time in planes. I travelled across Greater London extensively and the chauffeured cars arranged by concierge were efficient and friendly. With a couple of 4.30am starts the early morning tea and bakery were also very much appreciated. "
December 2013,Splendid London Mayfair Hotel oozing in history!,"We were fortunate enough to spend a few days in London just after the hustle and bustle of Christmas. The hotel is in a splendid location in Mayfair and it was still decked with all the Christmas decorations and this gave it a festive and cosy English home feel to it. Not that it needs Christmas decorations to make it feel homely! This historic hotel, reputed to be one of the first to open its doors in London, is warm and welcoming and the staff's attention to detail and courteous service make one feel very welcome indeed. The afternoon tea is legendary, the service impeccable but it does get slightly noisy as a result of the extreme popularity of this great British tradition here at Brown's! The food is very well prepared and very well served and the rooms comfortable and very…"
April 2014,Excellent and charming hotel in top location,"We spent a weekend at the Brown's and we're definitely satisfied about our stay. A few things can nevertheless be improved: keep the Dover entrance open all time (we had to tour around the block to use the other entrance in the evening and on the whole Sunday), make WIFI free and available from all rooms, get the air-con checked because it does too much noise. STAFF IS FANTASTIC AND ALWAYS AT YOUR SERVICE. good breakfast."
December 2013,Best Hotel in London,"For an authentic experience of the highest quality of British hospitality, service, accommodation and fine dining, nothing beats Browns Hotel. In the centre of the world's best shopping area, full of art galleries, and wonderful  Bond Street  shops, Browns is discreet and elegant. Afternoon tea- unlimited is London's best, while breakfasts are truly scrumptious, the salmon en croute on the trolley at lunch yesterday was sublime. Don't tell anyone,"
December 2013,afternoon tea at the Brown's,"Once again I choose the Brow's hotel for my Christmas afternoon tea with few friends, and as usual I call it top experience. This time I brough three new friends with me, and all of them they felt in love with the tea room. We loved the Christmas decoration, with the piano player, and of course the food and the service truly amazing. I am very glad when I discover a place which never disappoint me, especially when I bring new guests. Now even my friends say: afternoon tea in London, yes lets book at the Browns!!!"
October 2013,Amazing hotel and staff,"I was lucky enough to stay at the hotel for 2 nights recently. Was traveling with 2 friends, so we had a rollaway and they upgraded to a massive Jr suite for extra space. It was quite the treat. We arrived at the hotel around 10a and they told us our room would be ready in about 30 mins, however we were headed out for the day, so we didn't need early check in, but nice to know if we needed in the room it would be ready shortly. The hotel has so much amazing history and is so unique from building to building. Ask the staff, they are happy to indulge. Asked to see a few of the other room types since I will be returning again soon, and they had a few available to show - love how every room is so different. The views from all are very neat also. All of staff was amazing. We were…"
December 2013,best experience ever,"I was there last sunday with few friends of mine, their first day of the festive afternoon tea. nothing to compare with the other competitor in all Uk, and London. if you are someone just like me who does  not like to hear the word NO, when you spend a certain amount of money, this is the place where you need to go. Unlimited sandwiches, pastries, scones, cakes...but what gives a plus to this place is certenaly the service. truly attentive and friendly, and genuine, even the room was full, I felt like I was the most important customer. I would truly raccommand this place to all my friends."
January 2013,takes you back in time,"You may feel like you are paying for a Large luxury suite but dont get to excited to find that your room is nothing more than a nice average size bedroom full of old exquisite bedroom furniture, which is right up my alley. SUPER friendly and helpful staff, very nice and comfortable sleeping situation, always an answer to the best resturants and clubs and activities to do in and around London."
November 2013,"Nice, but perfection?","Staying in a very large suite recently showed again the mismatch of design and ergonomics as well as being userfriendly.  No sheers to block the view of the adjacent office workers, a desk that is not suitable for business (cluttered with menues, books and pictures), no international sockets...A masterswitch at the door and not next to the bed makes you hunt for light switches, a bath vanity that is full of products and trays but too small for own amenities - not thought through! The little gym is very nice, modern, light and well stocked with drinks and fruit, the Spa next door sadly does not have sauna or steam and seems to be an renovation-after thought. Full restaurants with very task-oriented staff, we did not get a pampered feeling during the meal, just very stern,…"
October 2013,sheer luxury,we went to browns as it was famous for its afternoon tea it was delicous we only stayed one night but all the staff where exceptional very well trained it was a great experience for my wife and i. the hotel is just the right size and in a perfect location also has a very good bar thanks to all the staff well done!!!!!!!!!!!!!
November 2013,Afternoon tea and Donovan's bar,"Had afternoon tea at Brown's hotel, lovely surroundings but uncomfortable, very low velour seating. We had a corner table, slight wait for service, but very friendly helpful staff. Extensive tea menu on offer. Finger sandwiches delicious and replenished. Warm scones, plain and fruit, plus fancies such as macaroons. Also offered specialists cake from trolley but we were so full we couldn't manage them. Pianist playing in the background which gave a nice ambience, not at all pretentious a very nice experience and a lovely birthday treat.  We also went to Donovan's bar and had cocktails to finish off our day out. Wonderful service, and lovely atmosphere. We had a great table and could see the mixologist do his thing. We thoroughly enjoyed it, we stayed for a couple of drinks, so…"
October 2013,Perfection,Only stayed for one night but difficult to find fault. The staff are clearly well trained to look after one 's every need. Very well furnished and comfortable room. Great bar quite lively later in the evening !
October 2013,Quintessential London,"Browns is famous for it's afternoon tea and is a perfect hotel in the middle of upscale shopping and walking distance to many of the tourist sites.  It's my ideal size, not too small but not one of those big chain hotels.  The service is special, the concierge staff wanting to take care of your every need.  When we got a smaller room with a view of a brick wall the hotel was quick to find us a more suitable one.  The bed was heaven, the marble bathrooms what you would expect from an upscale hotel.  London is pricey as is this hotel for Americans, but its worth it.  Plus you must have tea.  We had tea at 4 and didn't leave until 7:30, it ended up being our one meal of the day as the sandwiches and goodies are just divine."
January 2013,"A beautiful hotel, restored and modernized","The location of the Brown's is perfect for shopping and wandering.  The Bar was lively and served interesting cocktails.  The rooms have been redone and are sleek, modern but still classic with a comfortable feeling.  All of the staff were helpful and friendly.  There is an excellent Indian restaurant right across the street."
September 2013,The location of the hotel is superb.,"Great Hotel, Great Location, Great staff Staying at the Brown's Hotel was a wonderful experience, it has a great location and the food / service were superb. I would definitely choose to stay here again, I was on a walking stick at the time and the staff could not have been more helpful.  The location of the hotel is superb."
September 2013,AFTERNOON DE-LITE,"The elegance of afternoon tea at Brown's Hotel is a delightful experience.  Outstanding service without smothering the patron.  Delicious sandwiches and scones, wonderful clotted cream and jams and an ""all you care to eat"" replenishment guarantees a long and relaxing visit.  An intimate atmosphere of charm and grace with overstuffed chairs, fireplaces and piano music.  Not inexpensive but well worth the ""splurge""."
July 2013,afternoon tea,I didn't stay at the hotel but had the pleasure of enjoying afternoon tea in their salon. The service was very good and the food too. Totally worth it. And they refill your plates until you are done so you won't go hungry! I expected a bit more fuss but it was quite relaxed. Dress smart casual and it will be ok. Nice atmosphere.
October 2013,Wonderful experience,"Celebrated my big 3-0 birthday with an afternoon tea at Brown's.  The service was marvelous from the minute we walked in to the second we left. Stunning tea room,very quiet and peaceful,divine sandwiches and pastries ,lovely tea ,and fabulous Champagne. The hostess must have realised it was my birthday ,and surprised me with a divine truffle desert reading 'Happy Birthday' ,attentive and kind staff, superb service.  Highly recommended for both Londoners and visitors.  My new favourite place for an afternoon tea. "
October 2013,Hix Restaurant At Browns Mayfair,"Went to celebrate my granddads birthday,6.10.13  with the family had an amazing time, superb food excellent service. Antiono and his staff where great, My granddad left very happy like the rest of the family brilliant time will recommend to my friends had dinner at many other hotel restaurants but this was one of the best many thanks  K Taylor London"
July 2013,Perfect,"My husband, teenage daughter and I were fortunate enough to spend few days at Brown 's Hotel on London in July 2013. It was the quintessential London experience that I believe everyone hopes to have: excellent staff, very historic and elegant boutique hotel with the atmosphere of a private club, a beautiful room and fabulous dining with a very contemporary British focus (they even offer kedgeree on the menu), not to mention the perfect Mayfair location walking distance to so many tourist sights and fabulous shopping. The bar is atmospheric and fun, and the humorous but very professional doormen made it a point to memorise our names from the moment we checked in so 'Jonny' welcomed us back after each daily excursion by name as if we were returning to our private home. Every…"
September 2013,Top Notch Afternoon Tea,"Having had afternoon tea at Fortnum & Mason and not being impressed I was, after reading the reviews for Brown's ever hopeful, and I wasn't to be disappointed. From the minute we walked in to the trip to the powder room before leaving I could find no fault. I was in London with my sister for a special girls day out. We arrived a little early so had a cocktail in the bar, served with nibbles. We were informed by a member of staff from the tea room when our table was ready & no sooner had he moved away than the young lady who had served us our drinks was at our side with the bill. We were seated at a small round table, big enough for two in beautifully upholstered wing backed chairs, that were so comfortable I could have easily had a little nap after tea! The waiter came over to…"
August 2013,Good hotel Great size,"Browns hotel is a top of the line hotel located in a great area of London. Close to great pubs, restaurants and shopping. The staff was great and the rooms are huge compared to other hotels in Europe. They have good room service and a great little work out gym. The tv in the rooms is quite small but other than that. Browns is a great place to stay. The only drawback is that it is pricey. "
September 2013,Birthday Weekend,"We stayed at Brown's for my Birthday weekend & it was great from start to finish. The concierge are extremley courteous, as were the receptionists upon checking in. We were shown to our room, a very generous size with all the amenities you could wish for. The walk in wardrobe was just fantastic! The bed was very comfy and the bathroom was huge - toiletries replaced everyday and turn down service of an evening. My husband had ordered a birthday cake & a bottle of champagne for us, this was such a treat and the cake was delicious! We loved going down to the bar each evening before dinner- the atmosphere was very relaxed and it was very enjoyable to sit and have drinks and nibbles before dinner. All in all, an excellent weekend thanks to Brown's and we would definatley return!"
December 2012,English style at it s best,"A Paul Smith decorated Christmas tree, a bar with atmosphere and a room to dance in. Superb, but not if you look for hip and trendy. This is a hotel where you feel very British! It is perfectly located in Mayfair, walking distance from what is the best"
September 2013,Understated luxury,"Friendly greeting, car whisked away without fuss, fast check in, quick coffee and off into London. The room was enormous. Enjoy having  the space in a bustling city. Location is great for fast access to many parts of the city whilst not being too busy."
September 2013,The Best Afternoon Tea In Town,When ever I go for afternoon tea at Brown's it is fabulous. The atmosphere is fantastic and the cakes and tea are second to none. I always leave feeling full and well relaxed.   Where ever else I go for afternoon tea this is the standard that I judge it by. I also love that you can have as much as you like.   A big thank you to you all at Brown's.
September 2013,Fabulous Brown's Hotel Afternoon High Tea Experience,"First time at Brown's Afternoon High Tea today. Did not disappoint. A few key things:  1. It's very relaxed but at the same time very high end and British.  2. Ask for Andrea (Male, Italian) who will walk you through the experience. He is the Assistant Manager and a very sweet guy. He will walk you through each tea he suggests for each course (sandwiches, scones, desserts and cake).  3. It's unlimited - you can ask for more of your favorite items (I wasnt able to finish everything I received on the first round) 4. You get a lot of food - so the value is great. Quality of food fabulous. The jam with the scones is homemade with huge strawberries. Delicious. 5. Lovely piano player plays while you eat. 6. So you get 3 tiers of delicious food. (8 1/2 Sandwiches, 4 Scones, 5 mini…"
July 2013,Browns once more is perfect,"I cannot fault this hotel at all! This time we were in a more modern spacious room, we were greated with respect in a professional manner. We had afternoon tea, which I rank top notch in London, we were even given our left over sandwiche's and scones on a silver tray in our room after becoming repleat. The toiletries are five star, in fact everything was. It is a lavish hotel, in lavish surround's and the staff are exactly how they ought to be at this level and all do their jobs very well. No complaint's and highly recommended."
August 2013,Great Location - Welcoming Staff,"I stayed at Brown's as a child 40 years ago and returning brings back wonderful memories although there have been a few changes.  The staff were so welcoming, particularly Johnny the doorman. Our room (Junior Suite) was spacious, comfortable and quiet. The light meals at Donovan's Bar were great. This was the second time we have stayed there over the past 3 years and we will most definitely be back!"
December 2012,Best Afternoon Tea,I think Brown's Hotel serves the best afternoon tea in the world.  There are other places that are more glitzy or elegant.  Brown's feels like you are in a Sherlock Holmes novel - cozy and warm.  I have been here for tea on three separate occasions with several years in between each visit and each time I feel like I've been welcomed home.
July 2013,English Tea,"We went for a high tea at Brown's Hotel in London and it was absolutely wonderful. We sat in plush comfortable club chairs, had impeccable service, fabulous tea, delicious tea sandwiches (salmon on brown bread, chicken salad, cucumber, etc.) beautiful cakes, and we lounged all afternoon. Very posh hotel in an old school way, it was definitely one of our favorite activities we did while in London. I highly recommend it. It was myself, my husband, my son (19) and daughter (14) and we had such wonderful conversation. Also surrounded by very very expensive shops which is fun for window shopping."
December 2012,Christmas at Browns,"Saved up to spend a 3 day break over Christmas somewhere special, after plenty of research we chose Browns hotel. It was dissappointing in several areas, for a 5* hotel staff looked scruffy & disinterested, no water when we got to our room, light fittings hanging from ceiling. Some good points - Location, Breakfast choice. I did get a positive response from the manager to listen to my views."
August 2013,Lovely Hotel,"Browns Hotel is situated in a perfect place. All the main attractions of London are in arms length. The styling of the hotel is very classy but has some traditional features at the same time. Staff are polite and helpful, when being served. All the dinner staff are trained to a high standard, this shows throughout your meal. Rooms at Browns are fairly expensive, for the prices they are you would expect things like WIFI to be free in the hotel. But, no. £15.00 for 24 hours. This is absolutely ridiculous on top of the prices your paying for the room. You would of thought that the hotel would of made it free as they are already taking a large sum of money from you. It feels very rude of them to put prices on everything. "
August 2013,What a delightful place,"I had taken my mother for tea at the Ritz and was a little disappointed so when I wanted to go somewhere for my family to take me for my birthday (!) this is where I chose. The setting is lovely. You are seated on comfortable seats in a lounge area so it feels as though you are in someone's ( rather large) front room rather a dining room. There was a great choice of teas and you could even have a 'healthy' afternoon tea which pleased my sportsman son who had said that he would only have a cup of tea!  The food, both healthy and traditional, was excellent although I was a little disappointed with the final piece so cake.  I would give it 5 stars except for the fact that at the start staff were very attentive but they then sort of disappeared. We were only offered the rather cute…"
April 2013,Lovely experience in London,"Brown's Hotel is a wonderful home base in London.  The staff is what truly makes the difference - we found every one of them (particularly the concierges) to be charming and helpful.  I really can't say enough about the staff and all that they did for us.  Simon and Ashley went above and beyond to help us plan our days and make the most of our holiday time in London.    The common areas of the hotel are very comfortable and stylish.  The rooms are very nice, although less charming than the common areas.    The location can't be beat, providing easy walking access to Buckingham Palace and many of the sights.  We were in town at the time of the London Marathon and truly felt like we were close to everything, but not caught up in the crowds.   I've stayed in a number of wonderful…"
August 2013,Tea for 2,"Splendid!  I knew an exceptional experience was ahead of us from the time we were greeted on the pavement when alighting from the taxi by the footman.  The champagne was excellent, tea recommendations spot on from a very knowledgable and attentive waiter Andreas.  The macaroons were the best ever.  I still don't understand the cucumber sandwich, however I took away more tea knowledge than I thought possible."
August 2013,Great to relax in good old fashioned surroundings,"In order to get away from the hustle and bustle of the Mayfair shoppers I often pop in to Brown's - their English Tea Room - for a coffee or tea with friends. Service is excellent and attentive (without being intrusive) and it's like stepping back in time when life was a little less hectic. If you've ODed on the hip and on-trend hotels, try Brown's. I find it hard to beat!"
August 2013,The Perfect Hotel,On a scale of 1 to 10 this hotel is a 20+++. We had 2 executive rooms which were large and spacious perfect for a short stay. The gracious doorman greets you wearing his top hat and long tailed coat. Reception after checking you in walks you to your room and shows you the rooms features. The bellmen deliver the bags quickly. No detail is overlooked. Everyone should stay at this hotel at least once in their life. Where else can you go and sit by the same fireplace as Winston Churchill or where Alexander Graham Bell made the first telephone call. This hotel is 175 years old but the rooms are perfect up to date with separate tub and shower.
July 2013,Excellence,"A very nice hotel ideally located for shopping in Mayfair and bond street.  Rooms are spacious, and decorated with a modern British style.  Staff is very helpful and dedicated to their clients.  My new London base !!"
August 2013,"The English Tea Room, A Perfect Haven Of Peace on a Special Day","It was our 50th Wedding Anniversary and we had spent day 2 of the weekend avoiding Boris's 'bike-athon' (or whatever it was meant to be). Not being allowed to cross the Mall anywhere from St Jame's Park we were obliged to trudge the length of Constitution Hill and most of Piccadilly to get to Brown's for our afternoon tea booking. We did not find Albemarle Street too inviting, but 'fell' into Brown's with relief and so escaped from the noise and crowds to be pampered immediately by attentive but discreet attendants. Our seating position was perfect, as was the fine table linen; all was a civilised ambience in complete contrast to the chaos around Westminster and the Mall. Outrageous prices, of course, for what is after all perfectly ordinary food, albeit freshly prepared, but…"
July 2013,Brown's London's oldest and finest boutique hotel,"Now celebrating its 175th anniversary, Brown’s Hotel is the oldest in London in a street across the road from the Ritz. It was founded by Lord Bryon’s butler with his final pay-off, cleverly timed from the great poet who must have been in a rare moment of solvency.  He bought four town houses and knocked them into one hotel. The modern Brown’s is up to 11 houses, though still has only 117 rooms of which 29 are suites. That gives it long, meandering hallways but also real character.  Fortunately houses in Mayfair were always fairly grand and so the room sizes are quite large for London. The Royal Suite is like a complete Mayfair apartment, except for the lack of a kitchen. The Rocco Forte chain owns and manages Brown’s today.  We loved the interior design by Sir Rocco Forte’s…"
June 2013,"Great, luxurious hotel","This is an exceptional hotel. The staff are excellent - helpful, knowledgeable. The room was really comfortable, probably the best bed we've ever slept in. Central location - a truly great hotel in central London. Whilst it's not cheap, it is worth splashing out for this hotel"
June 2013,"Hotel average, staff great",We vacationed at the Browns on our stay in London in June.  We found the hotel needing an uplift.  Beds were too soft and creeky bedroom floors.  Staff was amazing and the breakfast was good.  Would rather of stayed at the Ritz around the corner.
June 2013,Relaxing Afternoon Tea,"We had a wonderful time having afternoon tea at Brown's.  After being on the go sightseeing, it was nice to having a relaxing afternoon.  My niece and and I felt very refreshed afterwards. The service was outstanding!   We felt like Queens for the day. The food was delicious!  I would love to have some of their fresh, warm scones right now.  Afternoon Tea at Brown's was definitely a highlight of our trip.  I would highly recommend it.  The next time I am in London I will being going back."
June 2013,Delightful Afternoon Tea,"Booked a nice table for two for afternoon tea online and was given a nice table on arrival.  Had champagne with the goodies as well.  Great friendly knowledgeable staff, excellent service and delicious food which keeps on coming if you want it.  Superb atmosphere a touch of class in the middle of London. Thoroughly recommend it for a special treat."
June 2013,We only had a Great English Afternoon tea...,"The service was excellent every member of staff had a warm smile. The sandwiches were divine the salmon excellent and as we all agreed it was the temperature that the food was served at that enhanced the flavour. All too often sandwiches are chilled far too much. There was endless supply of anything that we required. My only slight negativity were the scones..a wee bit soft and spongy (as though had been warmed up in a microwave) . The jam was superb and tasted of strawberries and the clotted cream was heavenly.  However, on the whole the day was fabulous as we were celebrating our daughters birthday. The piano playing as an added highlight. After tea we moved to the Donavan bar and again the service was faultless. I cannot recommend Brown's more highly."
June 2013,Best English Tea,"A most delightful and delicious afternoon tea at this grand hotel.  The service was perfect, everything tasted yummy and looked beautiful.  A nice break from our hectic pace of touring England.  Highest recommendation."
June 2013,aftenoon tea- gluten free,"A wonderful traditional afternoon tea- great service (thank you Saliya) - nothing was too much trouble- high quality and delicate sandwiches, cakes and scones- frequently replenished and lots of tea.   One of our group needed a gluten free tea - this was exceptional and looked exactly like the standard tea- in fact, the rest of us were quite jealous of the cakes.  This was a very relaxed and calm place to meet up with old friends and catch up."
June 2013,Stylish oasis,"I took my wife for an overnighter without children - our first trip back to London after moving out of town. The arrival with lunch & drinks at Hix felt very appropriate indeed - stylish, civilized, calm. The next day we had breakfast at Hix, drinks in the Donovan bar and high tea in The English Tea Room - absolutely no complaints at any stage. Service was faultless and friendly. Our only complaints are that the decor in the room was was a bit out of shape here and there - everything is very high quality, but we had the feeling that some things had been done a bit quickly. The ventilation system was also very effective but also quite noisy. So, all in all, for the price we paid for the stay, we felt that the stay met our expectations (which it should!), but we did not have the…"
May 2013,Afternoon Tea in Browns Hotel,"My wife and I enjoyed Afternoon Tea at ""The English Tea Room"" in Browns Hotel, London.  It was the second time, after thirteen or fourteen years that we went there.  We originally thought that we may go to a new place for change.  We did not do so simply because our first excellent experience of so many years ago was like ""imprint"" in our mind.  Atmosphere was gentle and relaxing as before.  Service was excellent.  The quality of tea and food also was really good.  If we go to London again, we wish to go to Browns.  Only problem is that we are more than eleven hours flight away from London."
May 2013,comfortable luxury,"In London I normally stay at the Dorchester, Claridges, or the SoHo hotel.  Brown's is as nice as any top Mayfair hotel, but it's more relaxed and comfortable.  The service, cuisine, rooms, and flowers are all stunning and they all felt like they were there for me to enjoy.  I felt equally comfortable in the lobby in a suit as I did in jeans and this is why I might choose to stay here over the Dorchester.  If you want a haven that is there to support you rather than waiting to be impressed by you, this is a great choice."
June 2013,A perfect martini,"After a day out on Monday walking through Mayfair I decided to go to Brown's Hotel to The Donovan Bar for a drink as recommended to me from my close friend. When I arrived I was warmly greeted at the door of Brown's and pointed a way to the bar where I was welcomed likewise by a manager, I suppose. While sitting down at the bar, the bartender approached me with a smile on his face (I don't see this very often nowadays). I asked for a martini and had been recommended whole range of them whereupon I ordered one with this delicious apple gin. What a great choice! Throughout savoring the great drink and chit chatting with this Czech guy I enjoyed the atmosphere of the jazz-like bar decorated with black and white pictures on its walls.  Anyone who is seeking for a great experience…"
May 2013,"Fantastic, fantastic","Stayed for 2 nights. Was given a complimentary upgrade which was fantastic. From walking through the doors to being shown to our room, from the concierge addressing you by name to reception giving advice on places to go and things to do, from the hot chocolate being so amazing (must say best I have ever had and I know a thing or two about chocolates), turn down service, a little technical issue which was addressed immediately. Wish I could have tried out the restaurant but needless to say I enjoyed it so much I am back in June and will ensure I try out the restaurant. Compliments to the staff and management who continue to achieve excellence in 5 star service and quality. Fantastic "
April 2013,Let down by missing touches,"This hotel is lovely but not perfect by any means.   My daughter and I stayed 3 nights.   Our room was on the small side but very comfortable and clean.   Highlights - the central location, the ambiance, Afternoon tea, and breakfast in the restaurant.   Downsides - It took a little while for the staff to get to know us as we were out and about most of the time. When I tried booking for afternoon tea the receptionist repeatedly suggested I book it online... I had to gently point out that we were guests of the hotel! Secondly the room wasn't prepared for 2 female guests, the turndown service laid out one male and one female pair of slippers and placed a treat (night cream/face wash etc) on one pillow only. You'd have thought that after the first day they could've adjusted things…"
April 2013,If only every London hotel was like Brown's!,"A group of us meet monthly for dinner and drinks at different London 5-star hotels, and out of the 42 we have experienced so far, I would rate Brown's the best. I was a little apprehensive at approaching them initially, as it has the reputation of being a very select establishment. I need not have worried, as from the first phone call, every member of Brown's was friendly, helpful and efficient.Two of us had dinner there in early April and enjoyed the food and the pleasant atmosphere. Later in the month, a large group of us had dinner at Brown's, followed by drinks in the bar afterwards, and everyone agreed that it had been an excellent, convivial and trouble-free evening, one of my colleagues writing the next day that ""the food was politely served, timely and excellent"". Though…"
April 2013,Second Stay as good as the First,"Had a deluxe room overlooking Dover Street. The room is spacious and comfortable and the feel of the place is very luxurious.  Didnt eat in any of the hotel's restaurants, but a sandwich from room service was very good and service was prompt.  Staff very good and check in/out was a breeze.  Will stay again!"
May 2012,I love Browns,"I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over Europe and the states but I love Browns. Is is truly a class act. From the momenet you walk in they remember your name and do everything they can to help. I stayed with my wife for three nights and could not have had a better time. The location is great. The staff could not be more helpful. The room , because of the high ceiling seemed huge. All and all a great place to stay in London."
October 2012,Best hotel in London!!,"One of the finest hotel in London: amazing service ( I had some issues w/my credit card and they deal w/that in such a gracious and elegant way...!). Rooms are gorgeous ( second floor has huge high ceilings)... I'd stay on deluxe and up ( regular rooms are very nice, however if you wanna add more charme to your stay, deluxe and up make a great difference!). Breakfast is delicious, not to mention afternoon tea... A real treat! My husband and I we always go for Frieze: it's a very, very busy period for the hotel, but the service, the quality and the general appeal never goes down a bit! So... Chapeau! The spa is also very good: clean and efficient, the space is nice and Sarah gives wonderful massages! A little plus: as Italian I must say it was a pleasure to share the hotel…"
June 2012,Wonderful for afternoon tea,"With a small child, we often go for afternoon tea on special occasions rather than going out for dinner, as it means we can involve the whole family and not have to worry about baby sitting. Brown's is our preferred venue. The afternoon tea is just fantastic. An array of different teas to choose from (with non-tea drinkers also well catered for), lovely finger sandwiches (and they'll do plain cheese for fussy children!), delicious scones and beautiful little cakes. And they'll refill the plates until you tell them to stop. And then you'll swear that you'll never need to eat again. We're going again for my birthday this year - can't wait!"
April 2013,Afternoon Tea,"What an amazing place to come for afternoon tea. I came with some friends without a booking, trying our luck knowing it is one the busiest and most renown place in London to have high tea. They welcomed us warmly, sat us on a lovely table and gave us a thorough explanation of the menu. My friend is actually gluten free, and it was not a problem at all! Two well presented stands arrived within minutes. The food was amazing from sandwiches to pastries (same for the gluten free) and everything was unlimited! The service is impeccable, friendly and non intrusive. We couldn't expect better. A place where I will definitely return. Brown’s :  a must for any Londoner!"
April 2013,Brown's is Gold.,"Rocco Forte has got it right. This Mayfair hotel on Albemarle Street is beautiful. I have visited this place for pre dinner drinks and dinner many times and it always impresses.   Last night I met a friend who is over from the U.S on business and we had a fantastic experience in the bar, the service from the moment you step into the room is top notch. Nothing is too much of a problem and the staff are all running a tight ship.  The bar itself is elegant, wood panelling and superbly rich furnishings surround you, everything feels luxurious.   The drinks themselves were as you would expect, executed perfectly. Glasses of wine expertly chilled and poured and my amaretto sour was great. I love the fact that you get plied with enough interesting salty snacks to keep you going before…"
April 2013,Superlative,"My husband a surprise for our 25th Wedding Anniversary which included a night's stay at Brown's. It was perfect. Of course it's very luxurious but what is much harder to get right is the gentle, friendly manner of the staff. The word ""welcome"" just doesn't seem adequate as a word for the perfectly judged way in which staff look you in the eye and make you feel you really, really are welcome and cared aobut. And when we got back to our suite at night to find beautiful deep pink rose petals strewn everywhere....welll!"
April 2013,Excellent Afternoon tea,"I would highly recommend Brown's for afternoon tea and also for anyone needing a gluten free diet. We took our mum for her 80th birthday, she has Coeliac disease and finds it difficult to find many places that cater for a gluten free diet. Her sandwiches looked the same as ours and she even had little cakes, as a surprise for her birthday the staff brought out a little cake on a plate with happy 80th birthday written in chocolate on the plate. We all had a lovely afternoon with more sanwiches being brought out as soon as our plates emptied and tea being poured for us as we emptied our cups. There's a wide selection of tea available and juice if tea isn't your choice of drink, all in all I would recommend Brown's to anyone looking for a treat or special occasion. The staff were…"
March 2013,Afternoon Tea!,"My friend and I had an amazing experience at Brown's Hotel today. Unbelievably good tastes, lovely atmosphere, piano playing, great service and smiles by everybody, and we feel lucky to have been so well-treated by Abi - it so changes your experience when people love their job! We were surprised and very pleased to get a tea sample of the tea we had there to enjoy at home :) I would definitely recommend it and it certainly deserves the title of being one of the best in London!"
February 2013,Weekend Break,Another fantastic stay at this wonderful hotel. A trip to London would not be complete without staying at Brown's. The staff are so warm and friendly and nothing is too much trouble. Faultless room with every luxury whilst still retaining a warm and cosy atmosphere. We stayed 2 nights and slept peacefully waking each day to a glorious breakfast. Can't wait to return and well done to all the staff!!
February 2013,Afternoon Tea service,"Went for champagne afternoon tea on Sunday 24th February, attended by a young man called William who had only been with the hotel for three weeks.  William is a credit to the hotel, smart, well spoken, polite, attentive and made a pleasant visit exceptional.  The rest of the restaurant staff were very efficient and all in all a very enjoyable experience and one we will partake of next time we visit London."
February 2013,Amazing Hotel in great location,Wow what a great stay me and my husband had at Brown's for my birthday weekend. They really know how to look after their guests. The room was one of the best Ive ever stayed in. We were treated to the most amazing cake made by the hotels pastry chef and champagne. All this within walking distance to the West End! Looking forward to the next stay.
February 2013,"Amazing hotel, I love it here","I love Brown's Hotel, this was our second visit (the first was 3 years ago) and I was really pleased to be back.  The Concierge was very helpful and accepted delivery of some parcels for me prior to my arrival, allowing me to surprise the Boyf with presents while we were there.   We stayed in an Executive King, the room was spacious the bathroom had a lovely bath and seperate ""rain fall"" shower and the bed and bedding were the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Breakfast is great, so many options and both the bar and room service also lived up to expectations. The staff are friendly and helpful and we were never made to feel out of place.  Highly recommended, I will be back as soon as I can afford it."
January 2013,Not as great as the name,"We stayed at Browns for several nights ( second time)  and enjoyed it overall. The staf is niche, friendly and well educated, the rooms are nicely decorated, the beds are perfect and the sleeping quality is very good. Still - except for the outstanding bar - it is not really excellent if you compare value for money. The tearoom is overrated and the floors and some of the rooms are shaped difficult.  With two entrances it is also a walk-through which irritates at first. The Hotel would not be our first choice again."
February 2013,An Exceptional Property in the Heart of It All....,"First time staying @ Brown's on the recommendation of American Express Centurion and certainly not disappointed:  A first class property with excellent location and superb service throughout the establishment accompanied by wonderfully appointed rooms with some of the finest sleep quality out there.  Most importantly, every member of the staff with special mention of both the concierge and front door attendant went beyond the call of duty to ensure that our five day London experience was enhanced as positively as humanly possible.  Simply, an impressive establishment!!!"
February 2013,Fantastic service,"We are so pleased we chose Brown's Hotel for our action packed 5 days in London. A brilliant central location, with cosy lounges, a beautiful wood pannelled restaurant with comfy yet contemporary furnishings and superb staff.  They are always there in the background, anticipating your every need.  Friendly yet efficient, just totally professional. The room was also smart and efficient though I would upgrade to a larger one next time.  We went for the entry level room. But having said that it was a good size and everything worked, great shower and cosmetics.  The rejuvenating cream at night was a lovely touch, as was the complimentary water and ice bucket replenished every day.  Shampoo was brilliant too.The bed was super comfy, just what you need after a long day and evening out…"
February 2013,Lived up to expectations,"We decided we would celebrate our 50th birthdays in style and chose our accomodation with that in mind. We took advantage of the hotels offer on a third night for free if you booked for two. From the moment you arrive the staff make you feel very welcome and comfortable. We were offered an upgrade on our booking at reduced rate which we accepted and weren't disappointed. The room was outstanding, modern with a huge comfortable bed large bathroom and well stocked (if expensive)mini bar. The breakfast was outstanding a wide and varied menu all excellently prepared and presented. We can also recommend the afternoon tea and the cocktails in Donovans Bar. We didn't have dinner in the restaurant so can't comment on that. All in all a top class establishment heartily recommended"
January 2013,"Classy, traditional, but yet modern.","The best location possible and with the old charm only colonial style hotels can offer. The very best of service, fantastic breakfast, to die for drinks, yummy afternoon tea and scones. Comfy and sleepy beds! Just first class - in style with the hotel de Russie in Rome - (Rocca Forte hotel). Probably not the most praiseworthy in London, but definitely a must stay one in a lifetime."
May 2012,Majestic in Mayfair,"Brown's may be my favorite hotel in the world.  It is charmingly relaxing with outstandingly friendly service delivered with such verve and style.  Afternoon Tea is a standout and one of the best in a city of superlatives.  My room was delightful, well appointed with soft as silk linens and pillows that made me want to forget my own (for domestic drivinn travel I usually take my own pillow).  Both breakfast (soft boiled egg done perfectly and toast soldiers) was the perfect start for a busy day and one lovely dinner rounded out my dining at Brown's.  All offerings were excellent and the deep fried asparagus stood out!  Brown's makes you feel comfortable, watches out for women travelers and is so very convenient to most London points.  I want to go back again and again!"
October 2012,Another fantastic experience,We were overwhelmed by the grandeur of the Kipling suite and could well see how Rudyard Kipling felt inspired to write The Jungle Book here. The perfect setting for intimate pre-dinner drinks with friends after a refreshing service of afternoon tea.  As always the facilities in the suite were of the highest standard and the bed was luxuriously comfortable. The staff in the hotel were friendly and helpful as ever without being obtrusive. Brown's has such a relaxed atmosphere throughout the hotel one feels instantly at home. An unforgettable experience and we will be sure to return.
August 2012,Amazing,"Absolutely loved it here, was made to feel so special, the room was amazing and was such a nice place to stay. Everyone was kind and helpful, the spa was also amazing. Would love to go back here soon!"
June 2012,Great Afternoon Tea,"I highly recommend getting afternoon tea at Brown's. The tea offerings were great and you get as many tea sandwiches, scones, and pastries as you can eat! The service was great and the food was delicious. I was highly impressed and would definitely recommend going here!"
September 2012,Respite in central London,"My wife and I stayed at Brown's for five nights in late September of this year.  It was our first time at Brown's having stayed at probably a dozen hotels across Mayfair/St James/Knightsbridge over the years.  I was a delightful stay and we will definitely return.  We had a bright, spacious room on a top level floor overlooking the rooftops along Dover Street.  At first we were concerned that it would be noisy with street noise, but it was quiet, both from external noise and from any of the neighboring rooms.  It was also nice to be able to open the windows during the day.  At night, I would have preferred more or brighter lighting in the room, but it was not a problem.    Our room had a large bathroom, but rather than a walk in shower, had a bath with the traditional British…"
September 2012,A New Favorite - Highly Recommended,"We stayed at the Brown’s for two nights in September at the end of our vacation.  We had not stayed here before but will definitely be back!  We booked an Executive King room on an advance purchase rate.  Of the 6 hotels during our trip, Brown’s won as our favorite in several categories including:  best bed, best pillows, and best shower.  Our room was of good size with a walk in closet and nice sized bathroom (with separate tub and shower – yay no shower curtain!).  It was tucked away in sort of a corner and though it had no view it was very quiet.  The hotel layout is kind of funky – lots of little turns, hallways and stairs up and down.  I personally think these types of places have more character but make sure you remember how to get to your room.  My only minor complaint…"
October 2012,Tea with style with  mini scones !,"Brown's hotel is a great place to have tea, it has a club atmosphere. We always manage to get a table a short notice, specially if you choose to go at 6pm instead of the usual 5pm. It is also a nice place to come with a larger group, we were  eight. We were greeted by a very nice spanish maitre D who then took note of our choice of tea. Soon after,  our tea, lovely sandwiches, few small pastries, and mini scones !. What a shame !. Would it very difficult to serve scones warm and make them a bit larger than a small canapé ?"
October 2012,Browns spa and Hix restaurant,"Fantastic manicure at Browns by Jana Watson and lovely room to do treatment in.  Concierge very good when you enter the hotel and hotel has a lovely cosy feel. Had a meal afterwards in Hix restaurant.  Lovely dinner, staff excellent and food very good."
September 2012,A weekend of fun!,"We recently stayed at Browns for a family weekend, it was our first stay here and we were keen to find out what it was like. We were not to be disappointed! As our taxi pulled up outside, the door was swiftly opened and we were greeted like long lost friends by the doorman, our luggage disappeared and was not to be seen again until it promptly appeared in our rooms! It is a beautiful hotel, classic finishes of the era the building was constructed are everywhere, however they have very cleverly incorporated all the modern needs of todays traveller, the rooms are superb, huge beds and headboards, and virtually every conceivable item you could possibly need is in the room! from mini bar, to ice cubes, to dressing gowns, slippers, bottles of mineral water, you would struggle to find…"
September 2012,Pricey average experience,"I have been in London many times. So here is the summary for this hotel: Pros:  -Location (near Picadilly, shoopping stores on Old bond/Counduit street) -Clean facilities -Gym facilities - spa - Good/personalized service  Cons: - Overpriced compared to other hotels in the same category. - concierge's suggestions were not what we were looking for  - Food at the restaurant was not very good"
December 2012,Lovely place to stay in London,"A beautiful place. Quiet rooms with plush beds, spacious bathrooms, elegantly decorated, great customer service and good location.  The rooms leave nothing to be desired. Even the toiletries are delightful.  The tearoom is always warm and and animated without being overcrowded, a real treat."
January 2013,"A trendy high-end London 5-star, with service and little touches not quite to match.","The hotel is contemporary throughout with a hint of old world in places. There is little to suggest the hotel is the oldest in London. Service and those small special touches associated with hotels in its class were however lacking. More detail should you wish...  Guest Room Upgraded from an Executive to Deluxe Room (a benefit of LHW membership), it was plush but certainly not spacious as one would expect from a room a few levels above the entry level. The bed was not as reserved (a King) but in fact two single mattresses pushed together. Notifying reception, they arranged a change of rooms to another Deluxe - this time far more spacious with lounge seating area. Upon inquiring as to the significantly different size, I was advised this was due to the hotels age. A poor excuse,…"
December 2012,honestly the only place to stay in London if you can afford it,"Browns is as good as it gets in every respect. the whole experience is seemless, professional, special and uniquely memorable. we spent a few days in the hotel before Christmas. the little touches such as personalized gingerbread men for my daughters and stockings on Christmas eve with small gifts really impressed me - everyone was happy to go that extra mile to make sure that our stay was great. my daughter was ill during the stay and the team really couldn't help enough. I cannot complete the review without mentioning the concierge service - if you look up concierge in the dictionary i swear you will find a picture of Simon and his team - they know London better than anyone - and I am a true Londoner! not forgetting also the doormen who help, entertain and are the icing on the…"
January 2013,Lovely weekend celebrating my mum's birthday,"I was lucky enough to win a 2 night stay at The Brown's hotel, and used it to celebrate my mum's birthday. We stayed at room 119 - a delux suite.  The room was lovely, big and quiet. I personally prefer a harder bed, but saying that it was comfortable. The bathroom had one of the best showers I ever tried! The breakfast was plentiful, and I would recommend to try the apricot jam with yogurt!  The staff was lovely throughout our stay!   "
December 2012,Great hotel superb location,"Top class hotel with very warm decor and welcoming rooms. both bar and restaurant are excellent. Hot chocolate in the bar is one of the best I ever had made of real thick chocolate. Hotel located in Mayfair close to almost everything by foot both for top class shoping, museums galleries and restaurants. Highly recomended"
December 2012,A wonderful time,"We decided to see New Year in at Donovan's bar & stay overnight. We were very well looked after throughout by attentive staff & enjoyed a fun evening, followed by a good night's sleep and a tasty breakfast well served. We couldn't have asked for more."
December 2012,Outstanding,"After being unable to book in for afternoon tea , we decided we would book lunch . Everything was amaizing , from the  service , atmosphere , food to the temperature of the red wine , perfect .if you like good quality food and fancy a treat then I would recomend . Will be back next year but do want to have afternoon tea next time"
December 2012,A Great Place to Stay,"We stayed at this hotel for my husbands birthday (50th), the package that I secured had Champagne on arrival with fruit chocolate fondue and much more besides.  From the moment we arrived we were made to feel very special the hotel itself has a wonderful relaxed but very luxurious atmosphere. On check in the reception upgraded us to a junior suite free of charge which was a lovely touch.  The room was contemporary and very comfortable, breakfast the following morning in Hix was very good again the service was attentive but not over bearing.  Would definitely recommend this hotel I know it isn't cheap but for special treat well worth the money two happy customers hopefully to be returning at some point soon."
December 2012,Christmas afternoon tea,"When all the other grand hotels are full for bookings on afternoon tea, you can still book about one month ahead for Brown’s. They may even allow a few walk-ins. Festive tea brings unlimited sandwiches, scones, mince pies, Christmas cake/log, tea cakes and petits-fours. All very tasty and beautifully presented. Nice atmosphere. Expensive at £51 per head but worth it."
December 2012,Loved the Brown's experience so much stayed an extra night!,"I do not often write reviews but felt as I use this site regularly when booking hotels/restaurants  it was about time I gave something back.  I booked this hotel for a Christmas trip to London with my 3 children (2 of which are very young) after browsing on the Internet 'best places to stay in London with children'. I have stayed in London frequently over the years and had yet to find somewhere that was luxurious, atmospheric, stylish and ..... Amazing for the children. A combination that doesn't always go hand in hand.  I had previously booked another hotel for our trip and had no qualms about cancelling that after speaking with Alastair. Booking was easy & efficient, I felt assured that I was making the right choice.    Our 3 hour car journey turned into a 5 hour journey (not…"
July 2012,perfect location,"What a welcome awaits, all the staff were friendly and efficient. nothing seemed too much trouble. Our room was tastefully decorated with all the little extra's you need, my daughter forgot her tooth brush and one was sent straight up to the room. it was also very quiet, which is sometimes hard to get in bustling London.! Breakfast was absolutly delicious, best scrambled egg we've had in a hotel! Extreemly tempting shops right outside...if you can avoid them then more just a stroll away. We normally stay Knightbridge side of London, but this was a lovely change, we would definatley stay here again."
February 2012,Superior Service,"The Brown's Hotel will not disappoint you when it comes to service. It is unusual for us to say that one of the highlights of our trips was a hotel staff member. But in this case it was. Manuela is a front desk employee who is not only professional and lazer focused on customer experience, but she appeared to genuinly enjoy assisting us and seemed to have an innate ability to make us comfortable.  She was not stuffy in any manner and she had a very enjoyable sense of humor. We look forward to seeing her again.   Kevin M.  New york"
June 2012,Superb accommodation and first class staff and service,Well worth a visit. Really looked after by all the staff. The food was excellent in the main dining room with all staff constantly in attention. Lovely rooms equipped with a good library and an excellent selection of reading material. First class location for central London and its facilities
July 2012,A treat in Town,"This was a bit of a treat. Lovely charm of a vintage hotel combined with modern elegance. Our room overlooked the rear entrance to Tiffany's and wonderfully for a London Hotel, traffic and street noise was very minimal. We went for pre dinner drinks in The Donavon Bar. This was Lively with a good atmosphere. All types there. Some dressed for a night out others there were obviously winding down.  The champagne by the glass is Ruinart. I chose the Blanc de Blanc at £20.50, which although has quite lively bubbles does have quite a sickly aroma which I assume is an aquired one.  Since we had a fairly long wait for our drinks, i'm afraid I didn't have that opportunity as we had dinner booked elsewhere. Gorgeous looking clear bottle though.  Breakfast was a delight. I asked for…"
July 2012,Superb,"Excellent food in the Hix Albemarle restaurant, some great dishes the home smoked salmon was just lovely, the snails and black pudding a great combination. Cornish Barnsley chop with cucumber was crispy, tender and full of flavor and the chocolate mouse for desert had great texture all in all a brilliant meal."
October 2011,As expected,Fabulous hotel loved our stay will be back soon could find no fault with surprising extras and service
July 2012,Quintessential English afternoon tea experience,"For a very special birthday celebration tea party, we could not have chosen better than Browns Hotel. This is quintessentially English afternoon tea experience - sandwiches, melt-in-the-mouth scones, clotted cream and jam, pastries, Victoria sponge and fruit cake - but there is also a 'healthier' option they call Tea Tox Tea. The two members of our party of eight who chose this less calorific option described it as 'scrumptious'. There is a wide range of teas, including Browns own afternoon blend which was my choice (reviving and refreshing). An advance phone call by 'best friend' ensured there was a delicate one-person birthday cake - the plate was decorated with a personal message in chocolate - specially for the birthday girl. The staff were charming and attentive. Our table…"
July 2012,A Little Piece of Heaven in Central London,"Ahhhh, I love this place. It is everything a smart hotel should be. It may be über posh, über swish and über expensive, but it wears its status lightly, with a casual, relaxed air. It never feels imposing or stuffy, the staff are charm itself - everything is effortless.  When I die, and should I be lucky enough to go to heaven - please God let it be like Brown's."
May 2012,a gem,What a lovely experience. Understated elegance at its best. Stayed here while on a 3 day trip to London. Would stay again.
May 2012,Splurge in London,"Browns Hotel is all about understated elegance and comfort.  If you are prepared to splurge a bit, don't want to stay in a big, busy hotel, but want a classy hotel in a great location, this is it.  The building has been beautifully restored, and while the elevators are tiny and the hallways narrow and winding, our room was spacious and very comfortable.  Our room was interior facing, which made it extremely quiet at night.  The tearoom and bar, while a bit pricey, are excellent and great places to relax and people watch.  Located in Mayfair, the hotel is an easy walk to all the sights of central London, and near lots of restaurants.  For runners, it is an easy jog to several nearby parks, creating opportunities for a multitude of interesting runs.  The fitness center is not…"
June 2012,Fantastic location,Spent 4 days at this hotel. Location can't be beat. Very expensive but service was exceptional. Rooms were clean but somewhat dated. This hotel is in a location that's a shoppers dream. Every major player within walking distance. Many good restaurants in the area. Walking distance to Picadilly Circus and several major tourists attractions. Can't say enough about service. Would definitely stay again at thi property.
June 2012,"Great location, comfort and history!",We attended a business conference at this very old but modernized hotel.  I beliveve it is the oldest hotel in London.  The rooms of course are updated but the ceilings are a bit low.  Very comfortable beds and nice bathrooms.  Service was excellent.  Bar was nice and breakfast ok.  The afternoon tea is very special one of the best in London.  The hotel is just steps away from all the designer stores.  An expensive place in a great location with super service.
May 2012,High Tea,"While visiting London for my grand-daughters 21st she wonted to experience  High Tea, me being on a Gluten Free diet it was a matter of finding an establishment that catered for both normal food and Gluten.Grand-daughter came up with Browns Hotel they gave us first class treatment from the minute we stepped inside the door. The variety of food for both diets was exceptional in taste presentation and atmosphere (we were sat beside the open fire on a cold rainy day) sandwiches, cakes, scones, choice of wines, tea.I would recommend the High Tea at this hotel as 5 star and when we were to leave the hotel porter went to the end of the street in the rain to get us a taxi."
June 2012,Wonderful Staff,"Everyone was so kind, the hotel very clean, the food very good, the staff was helpful."
May 2012,Fine traditional betel and service,"Room was ready before scheduled check in time. We had a traditional English afternoon tea which was excellent. The concierge arranged for the Chef to make us an English specialty of pork pie which is not on the menu, they were excellent. The only complaint we had was that the heating was on in the bathroom which made the room warm, we had to request it be turned off. Location is close to the main shopping streets, bond street, Piccadilly street, Oxford street and the theatre district."
June 2012,Posh but relaxed afternoon tea,"Very nice welcoming, not snobbish, great pastry, finger sandwiches average. Waiters were attentive but made you feel at ease.  Only downside was that other guests were more casual than smart."
June 2012,Very nice but you pay for it...,"Very nice hotel and fun scene.  However, our room, not suite was $1,000 a night and they had the audacity to charge close close to $25 a day for internet service and automatically add $14 a day for a room service tip.  While the hotel was very nice I thought the internet charge was pushing it given we spent over $3500 for just one room over three nights."
May 2012,Great Location Some Drawbacks however.....,"We stayed in a deluxe room which was a the top of the hotel. Whilst the rooms were very clean, they do require some updating if they are to remain competitive- they are starting to look a little tatty in places and the b&o tv dated. The biggest let down for this hotel is the restaurant- Hix which was generally poor- not a great menu and the breakfast was sloppy- food ordered was just dumped on the plate- the sausages were not great etc. no doubt about it though, this is a great location but there are better options for the price. "
May 2012,The Best Experience - The Best Hotel,"I stayed at Browns Hotel the night before my wedding, and on my Wedding night. Both nights we were given an upgrade, to the most fabulous suite - this without any request or prompt from us. The staff were not only professional, efficient and courteous they were  warm, friendly and extremely kind. There is absolutely nothing to fault with this hotel, it has to be the best in London and it was by far the best hotel experience we have had anywhere in the World. Truly, truly outstanding !"
May 2012,Old English ambiance...comfortable in its own skin.,"Brown's is by no means stuffy.  Quite the contrary.  They seemed to have accomplished a fresh feeling with their warm service, simple but excellent kitchen, and their public rooms.  High tea is celebrated as an art form here.  The bar has an excellent selection of single malt scotch for the connoisseur.  And the bar tender was a artist, a mixologist of the highest order.   The owners are to be complimented.  Yes, I'd go back but I still need to check out some of the other excellent hotels before Browns makes my short list.  Above all, thank you for your kind hospitality."
January 2012,Brilliant,A luxurious home from home in Mayfair. A really comfortable hotel that feels intimate. Staff are wonderful. The restaurant; HIX by Mark Hix is outstanding. Buzzy bar. Brilliant afternoon teas.
January 2012,'Brilliant' experience,"On an overnight business trip to London and couldn't have made a better choice of where to stay. The room exceeded my expectations and in a nutshell, my entire experience was simply 'Brilliant' and would highly recommend to any 'trip' reader."
January 2012,Absolutely Superb!,"I stayed at Browns on Sunday 8th January. We had a junior suite on the 4th floor and I could not find one fault in the Hotel or service. Even the doormen and concierge were extremely polite and helpful! Our room was spacious with fresh fruit and everything in the mini bar you could possibly need! In the morning as we were catching an early train to Paris we ordered breakfast in our room and again the cooked breakfast was superb along with the service which was prompt. If you are after immaculate service, friendly atmosphere and great quality, you will not be disappointed in Browns!"
January 2012,Donovan Bar - real buzz,"Pre dinner drinks in Donovan Bar - fascinating mix of people. Lively. Cocktail waitresses very attentive, patient and friendly. Lively. Expensive."
January 2012,The Public has priority over hotel guests !,"I trawled through London's new and renovated hotel offerings on the internet and was very tempted by several of them, but having stayed at this hotel previously, I took the easy option and decided to return to it. As previously, I went down to the Tea Room  to have a cup of afternoon tea and read my book.  Unlike previous visits, I was refused and told that I could only go into the dimly lit bar !  The Tea Room was being kept for what appeared to be non hotel guests of principally Asian origin to take full afternoon tea !! Apparently, to be an hotel guest affords one no rights to reasonable use of the facilities ! Next time I trawl the internet offerings, I shall chose more wisely !"
December 2011,"Beautiful hotel, very attentive service","We stayed at Brown's for a 10 day stay over Christmas. Everything was perfect, the hotel is beautiful, nicely renovated and they gave us a big room as we were staying for such a long time. The service was really outstanding, everything was done very quickly. Whenever I called with an extra request, they were at the door 10 minutes later, delivering what we'd asked for. I complained once and they went out of their way to apologize and make things better. My go to hotel in London from now on!"
December 2011,Wonderful family experience,"We stayed at this amazing property right in the elegant Mayfair with all the family. My husband and I and my two boys of 7and 4 years. When we checked in in our wonderful and very spacious suite, Rooms 101 we found the most incredible welcome amenities such us champagne for us and all the most special pastries and toys for the kids. The staff was very friendly and professional and most of them are italian and for us it was perfect. We highly raccomend this property!"
December 2011,Fabulously opulent surroundings at bargain basement prices!,If you are looking for truly superb food in truly superb surroundings - and you are in London - visit Brown's in Mayfair. It's a real special place to take a loved one or to show off to business colleagues - but the great thing is the prices are really really good and the food - world class.You can usually get in at lunchtimewithout a reservation - but best to make one if you can. A great place.
November 2011,Outstanding!,"A fabulous example of how it should be done.  Seamless excellence in all aspects. Beginning with the doorman who opened our taxi's door to the genuinely fond farewell.An amazing start to a celebration week-end.  Brown's has it in spades.  Wonderfully comfy beds and the tv in the bathroom a real wow with our teenage daughter!  The staff were all welcoming, polite and helpful."
May 2012,Just Perfect!,"I recently travelled to London with my newly fiancé to celebrate our engagement. We chose Brown's Hotel as we heard it is one of the oldest hotel in London, because the location is great and because we are affectionate to Rocco Forte hotels. Our stay was just perfect, like a dream.. We informed the hotel that we were there to celebrate our engagement and they did their very best to make our stay memorable, starting from a warm welcome from the GM at check in to a room upgrade, a bottle of champagne in the room awaiting us with some fresh fruit and a lovely card. And it wasn't over.. at our return to the room in the evening we found rose petals and candles around bed, sofa and bathtub, it was so romantic. Next day we decided to make the most of our beautiful room and have…"
April 2012,A memorable afternoon - High Tea,"Organised as a surprise for my recent birthday, I was treated to a fantastic high tea at Brown's Hotel.  The tea room, housed within the beautifully appointed Hotel was warm and welcoming, even though we showed up 30 minutes early.  The selection of teas was interesting and the food was fresh and plentiful.  Highly suggest indulging with a glass of Champagne (albeit expensive).  A memorable experience that can be enjoyed by all ages."
April 2012,Enjoying a bit of history at Brown's,"I moved here from a dismal closet of a room by Victoria Station and felt as though I'd gone to Heaven.  London is SO expensive, and staying here was certainly no bargain but the quality of the experience was very high.  The single room I had was most comfortable and although the window stared right at a wall, what can you expect in a row of townhouses?  I wasn't able to get a rate that included breakfast and chose not to spend the $30+ but instead nipped out and got a good take-out breakfast just down the street.   My one complaint here is that despite all the amenities, you are charged extra for using wireless internet, a set fee per each day of useage.  This is an anomaly to me and one I've run into at other 5 star hotels.  While you can stay at any number of cheaper hotels…"
April 2012,Fantastic Hotel,"The is the best hotel I have ever had the pleasure of staying at. The staff were so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble, and they upgraded us to a the Albermarle suite. The food was delicious - amazing smoked salmon. Perfect location. All round brilliant experience."
April 2012,Great Hotel,"Lately we have been travelling to London quite often and the highlight of our trips is the stay at the Brown's Hotel. It has the best location, and this helps, but what we love most is the staff. Everybody is extremely nice and helpful and every time the feeling is like coming back home. We also love the food, from the fantastic afternoon tea to a very good dinner, without forgetting the bar for a quick bite. Some rooms are on the small side, but we rather compromise some space for all the rest. We will definitely go back every time we are in London."
April 2012,The Best Hotel,"The Hotel did a marvelous job of making my eleven year old granddaughter feel like a princess. There were cookies and chocolate eggs with her name on it. There was a special tooth brush and tooth paste, and everyone was so helpful and kind. I have traveled many places in the world and I would say that this is the most outstanding hotel I have ever stayed in. The Browns in Number One in my book."
April 2012,Afternoon tea,"I had afternoon tea at Brown's with a friend of mine 2 weeks a go and i was very impressed by the service and the quality of food. It was worth every penny and i strongly recommend the place . Also had a drink in the bar and the atmosphere and service was outstanding , and the selection of nibbles was great . i will definitely return again"
April 2012,To the last detail,"When you go to a 5-star hotel that you've heard is fabulous, your expectations tend to be very high.  To the point that you may be overly sensitive to the slightest imperfections.  At Brown's, it's as though they have thought about every possible thing the traveler might experience, and figured out how to make it effortless and pleasing.  It's hard to say even what makes it so special.  It's in every little detail.  The way you're always greeted, the way you're casually walked through the little elements of your room that other hotels often leave you to figure out on your own (like how the hot water in the shower comes on by pressing the little red button), like supplying an electrical converter on the desk so you can quickly plug in your computer.  I absolutely loved my…"
December 2011,Posh as Posh can be! Great with Children too.,"OVERALL This is we hear the oldest hotel in London. And, as our friends from the UK said, this is a ""very posh hotel"". And we totally agree. We were treated with great respect and all of our needs were pre-taking care of.  GREAT WITH KIDS We were particularly impressed with how well they took care of the children guests -- giving them a unique experience with the hotel with: - cookies made with their name on them - special treats left for them every day - gave them books to read and play with - unique bed trimmings for the kids - fun bathroom items - shampoos and toothpastes for kids (see pics)  WHAT WAS EXCELLENT - the beds and bedding were exquisite, like a soft fluffy pillow to lay in - bathrooms were large and luxurious - the staff thought of everything, and did not seem to…"
April 2012,"Great area, nice place","I stayed here for 2 nights in December 2011.  The concierge is great, and the setting is excellent, this part of Mayfair is the place to stay.  The lounge is the place to meet people, great vibe.  Concierge is excellent.  Room had a view on a quite boring courtyard."
September 2011,A special occasion hotel,"Brown’s is an individual top-end boutique type hotel located on a peaceful street but just 3 or 4 minutes walk away from the hustle and bustle of Oxford Street. The staff are incredibly polite and attentive. The reception is small but with attentive staff who once the formalities of registration are taken care of show you to your room.  I've rarely stayed at a hotel where registration and check-out was so pleasant, quick and easy - and individual.   We stayed in a classic room (bottom end room) which was very comfortable and tastefully decorated and with some nice touches including some interesting art, books and more unusual magazines including Wallpaper (on interior design) and School House (a scary magazine for pushy parents looking at private schools in the UK). The bed was…"
August 2011,"A luxorious ,splendid hotel,yet in a calm and tranquil surrounding","I stayed in this hotel actually nine years ago...It has been renovated after that...but yet the style is the same. A luxury hotel in Mayfair,great location,and yet not too big...a stylish boutique kind of hotel. And all so modern,yet lovely English.wonderful five a clock tea and after a nite out,it was just wonderful to sit in rhe lobby in front of the fireplace. The service was excellent as was everything about this hotel.The location is just right,near everything..the theatres, Oxfordstreet..The atmosphere was so amazing,from years gone bye..and yet with all the modern facilities.."
August 2011,Nice but Way Overpriced,"Checked in on 8/17 and was taken to a room smaller than my closet at home and overlooking an interior lightwell.  For over $800 per night, not the kind of accommodations one would expect, but since we were tired from a 12 hour flight from Los Angeles we waited until the next day to complain.  We were shown two different rooms - both very nice, but one which cost an addition $120/night, the other $250/night additional.  We took the lower priced upgrade which was very nice and reasonably spacious - by London standards - and had three windows overlooking the street.  Because I had stayed here many times years ago, before the Forte group took it over, I was disappointed by the excessive charges.  That being said, the included breakfast was very good as was dinner in the restaurant. …"
August 2011,We loved it and we'll be b a ck,"I had the most pleasant stay at Brown's Hotel in Mayfair, London, England recently.  It was the most comfortable sleeping in years with gorgeous soft, fluffy pillows.  It has the dignity and reserve of days gone by.  The staff were were courteous and and friendly.  Brown's is a  small hotel without the noise and bustle of the larger hotels.  So if you are looking for a quiet hideaway yet close enough to other swinging emporiums for an exciting night out., this is the place."
June 2011,Personalized very professional service,"The staff was responsive and handled any issues with grace and poise. The hotel is perfect for its location, great  restaurant and tea room. We had a lovely bedroom, Very comfortable bed. Concierge services were great.  Highly recommend and the area is superb and shopping outstanding. Great experience and would rebook again. Personalized very professional service."
July 2011,50th Anniversary High Tea,"We were in London for our 50th Anniversary.  Our son was with us & suggested ""High Tea"" at Brown's.      We came. We saw. We ate. We enjoyed. They conquered.  It's a ""Once-in -a-Lifetime"" experience that I'd like to repeat!!   And right across the street from Tiffany's!!       ""Tea at Brown's/Tiffany's"".  That sounds like a great movie title.      We arrived about 5:00 p.m. Had reservations & were seated immediately -- at a table by the window. At my request, the pianist played ""Moonglow"" to surprise my wife!  It worked. She almost cried as she said ""Thank You."" Pianist had an excellent repertoire.     From there we went to the theater & saw ""Billy Elliott.""  A great day."
July 2011,They spoiled us,"We stayed at Brown's four nights with our daughter age 10.Large room 40 sq.m in the fifth floor.King size bed for us, extra bed for my daughter. Room made and cleaned twice a day. New quilt cover for our beds every day, my daughter's with childish decorating. Home made cookies by her bedside with her name written upon them.Small things that make a big hotel. Superb location didn't need taxi for our walks to the center. Breakfast from a rich buffet,     excellent  dinner with junior menu, we liked it wasn't so formal, waiters calling you by your name. Everybody friendly and willing to help. As a result they spoiled us."
July 2011,Afternoon tea - what a fantastic experience,"Arrived at Browns Hotel yesterday for afternoon tea to celebrate my daughter's birthday. What a wonderful experience! Staff very attentive, truly impressive tearoom, and the tea itself was beautifully presented. The pianist played ""happy birthday"" tune and a member of staff presented my daughter with a tiny cake, topped with a lit candle! Thank you very much Brown's Hotel, for making this a very special day for myself and daughter."
April 2011,great hotel,"We love this hotel, especially the afternoon tea.  In the tea room the helpful chinese girl with the pretty smile has left  - thats a shame, but the rest of the staff are still great!"
July 2011,Very nice hotel in convenient location,"The Brown's Hotel London is truly a nice experience. The hotel provides very nice rooms, good service, excellent breakfast, a nice bar and famous afternoon tea. We have been very lucky and received a complimentary upgrade to one of the larger accommodations. The design of the hotel is nice mixture of modernity, coziness and elegance. We have booked afternoon tea on one of the days of our stay. Surprising and disappointing: their herbal infusion was not available on that day, even though we had pre-booked the Tea Tox. Also the service during afternoon tea could have been a little bit more friendly-warm as it was a bit too professional, blasé. Overall still a nice experience."
December 2010,Simply the Best Hotel in London,I sent a loong weekend in London and Just could not get the level of service this hotel has to offer. The Front Office Staff are amazing and could not do enough for us from the moment we arrived.  The Beds are so comfortable I had the best nights sleep in a hotel ever.   If you go there have Afternoon Tea the whole experience is just out of this world.  And the Location is perfect
April 2011,Everything I'd hoped for and more!,"Myself and my husband stayed here in early December so the hotel was decorated for Christmas. It was heavenly to walk through the door and be greeted by the delicious scent of pine. The decorations were so tastefully done and served only to enhance the already beautiful hotel. We both felt instantly at home which is rare. My husband is a permanent wheelchair user and although there was a small step at the entrance the concierge were quick to deploy the ramp with minimum fuss. This was the same throughout our stay, my husband was never left waiting. Our room had an adapted bathroom with a roll in shower and also one with a bath and walk in shower. A bathroom each...great!!  The bed was extremely comfortable and we awoke thoroughly refreshed. The location of Brown's is excellent.…"
March 2011,excellent,"i really enjoyed staying in this hotel.. perfect location, everything is near by either shop or best restaurants.. the conceirge were very helpful..  i wish to stay again in the hotel.."
March 2011,Very good service,"I love this hotel. It is the third time I come, and everytime I like it more. Staff is super friendly, location unbeatable, and the rooms are classic and modern at the same time. Also, rooms are big for a city like london!! I highly recommend this hotel!"
March 2011,"Great staff,fabolous location","I would like to take this opportunity to express our thanks and appreciation  to the entire staff of Brown’s hotel for the courtesy and professionalism  exhibited during our stay this month. Front desk staff  and housekeeping staff in particular were a joy to deal with. We  couldn't be more pleased.  In particular, the dealings my wife and I had with Manuela at the front desk  were friendly and very professional. I wish I had someone like Manuela  working for me. She is a true asset to this hotel. She is a large part of  why we enjoyed your hotel so much. She simply brightened our days. In short,  she is a fine, lovely, professional young lady.  .We would love to stay at Brown’s again some day."
March 2011,"""For me this is the Hotel all others need to be,it's simply perfect""","I use Browns lounge a lot for meetings, but have never stayed here before. I stayed on sunday the 13th (room 311). Browns is just off Piccadilly and not far from Park Lane, so in the middle of the West End hotel district. But it's a stand alone and stand out property. It's not flash, brash or full of Tourists. It's understated but a real connoisseurs dream. Check in was fast and easy, the excellent door men had my bags in my room before I go there, the check in staff insisted on showing me my room and how everything worked. The room was beautifully clean and well decorated, it was not large, but ample size.   They left a fresh fruit platter and some ice in the room and undertook an evening turn down. The Bathroom was a good size and well laid out, the REN products they use are a…"
February 2011,Beautiful Hotel that went the extra mile to make out stay extra special,"We arrived at Browns Hotel as a last minute booking due to our booked hotel proving very disappointing.  As my husband and I were on our honeymoon we were looking for a hotel that was extra special.  My husband explained our ordeal to the night receptionist who tried his upmost to rectify our disappointing evening at the previous hotel.  After congratulating us on our marriage (something missing from the previous hotel) we were given a free upgrade to a suite (upon arrival were given a tour of those available in order to make our selection).  Whilst the room was being turned down and our luggage delivered, we were given complimentary champagne in the hotel bar. One the second night the suite had been prepared with candles and rose petals, which made our stay feel special. I…"
February 2011,Oppulence,"I was fortunate enough to stay at Browns Hotel with my Partner.  As it was my Birthday we were upgraded to an Executive room (we'd bookeda classic).  Not sure what the difference is between the rooms,but the room we got was lovely. A very large bathroom with shower and bathroom, great REN cosmetics (nice touch), beautiful larecomfy bed, which wasdecorated with rose petals in the evening, there were also night lights around the room.  Service was 5*** .  Went Donovans bar - and had a cocktail @ £14.00 - it was delicious though, my partner had a Japanese whiskey @ £18.00.  We then went for dinner and I had the best Lemon Sole Dinner I have EVER tasted - it was so tasty.  We had a starter each and deinner and 2 bottles of wine - the bill (inc the cocktails) was £182 - so yes itwas…"
February 2011,Great hotel however freezing room disappointed,"I would certainly recommend a stay at Brown's however I we were unfortunate to be given a room where the heating did not work and therefore found ourselves having to phone reception for a plug-in heater after asking them to check the heating previously. We were offered a room change however at 12pm midnight this was the last thing we wanted to do.  All in all the hotel was good, bed was very comfortable and staff were very helpful. We had the English tea and whilst the quality of the food and service was very good there was something lacking."
January 2011,Fabulous Luxury and attentive service,"Browns Hotel is beautifully decorated, luxurious without being stuffy.  Our room was very well planned and immaculate.  All the staff are really helpful without being obsequious and the food at Hix Restaurant was all delicious.  Browns is by far the best London hotel we have stayed in and I couldn't recommend it more."
July 2011,"Luxury and superb service, great location for shops and culture","We stayed for 4 nights as a special treat for my wife's birthday. We couldn't fault anything. The service levels are superb, the room was large (we had an executive king) as was the bathroom which was very spacious and had a large bath and walk-in shower. The breakfasts were the best we have ever had in the UK - superb choice, size and freshness (top marks for the smoked salmon and scrambled eggs!). We also had a very enjoyable meal one evening in Hix at the Albermarle. We didn't use the gym or spa facilities so can't comment on those, and didn't have room for afternoon tea! On top of this, the hotel is extremely well located in a side street off Piccadilly that runs parallel to Bond Street. The setting is much quieter than the Ritz which is a few hundred yards away but Brown's…"
June 2011,Prime location in London,"A great hotel just a few steps away from Bond and Regent Street - ideal for this on a shopping trip. Very friendly and helpful staff. The hotel is well known for it's afternoon tea, though I haven't tried during my past stays. The bar is always bursting after office hours and servers and is specialized in all kind of Martinis. Don't miss it. A word of caution: The rooms, even in the same category, differ greatly, du to the structural nature of the building. If the hotel is not fully booked upon your arrival. let them show you what is available. But I can only recommend this hotel."
July 2011,I can only thank my travel agent,"I tend to do a bit of 'hotel hopping' but after this stay at Brown's I will most certainly make it my home in London.  There was a buz around the hotel, one could feel how busy the place was, Paul the Doorman welcomed me as if I was the only guest he was expecting that day, showed me to the Reception and introduced me to a smily Receptionist who showed me to an immaculatly clean  and large room.  The decor was pleasant and calming unlike the common 'in your face' typical design patterns of most luxury hotels.  The Concierge managed at least two miracles during the 3 days I was around and the restaurant serves the best 'spotted dick' (traditional British desert for those who think I am being naughty) in Mayfair.  Needless to say the location is perfect for anyone on business or…"
June 2011,"Classic hotel, brilliant location","Stayed here on the last night of a trip to London, and loved it. Located on a quiet street just off Piccadilly, the hotel is conveniently located in central London (see picture from Albermarle St).   The room allocated (see pictures) was large and spacious, as was the bathroom. We had a third floor room which looked onto an internal courtyard, but the room was still quite light, and was very quiet. The room had an updated classic feel to it, and had some interesting art (as did the corridor outside). I'd not expected the rooms to be so large. The bathroom was light and airy.   The hotel is well-located for shopping, eating and cultural pursuits. The Royal Academy of Arts is literally less than five minutes' walk, and further afield is the National Gallery and the National…"
May 2011,"JUST AWFUL, not a 5-star hotel, DREADFUL, DISGUSTING place","I stayed at Brown's for a six night period in June of 2011. THIS HOTEL IS A JOKE. IT IS A DISGUSTING, DANK HELL HOLE. It was by far, one of the very, very worst hotel experience that I have had in a very long time. I travel perhaps 3-4 months out of the year for both business and pleasure. I have stayed in hundreds of hotels worldwide, and this one is really  the very bottom of the barrel. For the $1000 per night I was charged, the owners should be arrested and jailed for fraud and deceptive marketing practices. I would have moved hotels immediately upon checking in, but it was the week of Wimbelton and London was booked solid.  Where to begin, it was all so bad. I arrived late and was directed, not escorted, to my room. It was a dank, ground- floor room that reeked of body odor…"
May 2011,Excellent Location - especially for gallery hopping / Prefer the St. Regis,"Overall:  A well run business / leisure hotel with great location and solid service, but at these prices I'd go with the Lanesborough, St. Regis.  Brown's just feels weird to me - the rooms are nice, however, a bit sterile - as is the staff.  Location:  Excellent location right in the middle of london.  Perfect if you want to visit art galleries, shop, eat or do the usual tourist thing.  Very close to all transportation hubs.  Common Areas/Lounges:  While the rooms are super modern, the common areas are more traditional.  The building's bones are very old - so you weave left/right and up and down throught the hallways - it doesn't have a big foyer like modern hotels - rather a number of lounges / restaurants and common areas.  If it's your first time staying there its a good…"
May 2011,"Hix Restaurant...........very good indeed.... recommended for quality, service and comfort","I dined at Hix Restaurant at Browns Hotel last week with two close friends, really not expecting anything special. All three of us have separately dined at every top restaurant in London over the years.   Browns Hotel offer a choice of bars for pre-dinner drinks…we chose the bar at Hix. Pre-dinner nibbles were perfect (cashews; beetroot crisps; terrific olives….just what I wanted). One needs to rate Hix alongside places such as Wolesley/Scotts and not La Gavroche….it is a comfortable restaurant for everyday eating… and not supposed to be a two Michelin place. As such, the quality of food, service and comfort way surpassed both Scotts and Wolesley however Hix is nowhere near as trendy. Also, one gets the feeling that you can stay as long as you wish at Hix…..they don’t try to…"
May 2011,"Could not be faulted in any way , pure luxury","My husband and I have just returned from an overnight stay in London to attend a business function. We selected Browns for its central location in Mayfair and its renown reputation. We were not disappointed, easy access  from Paddington, fantastic location in the heart of Mayfair yet amazingly quiet for a central London hotel. From the moment we arrived  until we left every member of staff  we encountered welcomed us warmly  all with a smile  and offered every assistance to ensure we had a memorable experience . Our suite accommodation was spotlessly clean with  such attention to detail , huge  super king bed with crisp white linen. Our bedroom had an abundance of extra touches , including a dressing area , a gentlemen's valet stand and freah orchid , The sitting room overlooked…"
May 2011,Fantastic weekend,"Brown's hotel is very well located especially for theatres, museums, galleries etc. The room was very well appointed and the bathroom was wonderful. Everyone made us feel very special as we were there for our anniversary, staff have a genuine warmth..nothing was too much trouble.  Definately worth a visit, we had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. A must and certainly very memorable.  Go and enjoy!!"
April 2011,Perfect hideaway in Central London,"The best place to stay in London if you are looking for something central, yet quiet. Just off the Bond street and close to park, so you can have the best of both. Very elegant and understated."
September 2010,WONDERFUL STAY,"The location of the hotel is something special, in the middle of Mayfair, good for shopping and walk. The hotel is traditional, very comfortable, big room and bath, staff very friendly. If you can afford their rates it is a very good option."
August 2010,Browns is now perhaps the best hotel in the world.,"The George V may have better flowers and the Shanghai Peninsula a better building, but Browns is I think the best hotel in the world because it combines a perfect location for walking and shopping, a consistent professional staff. luxurious accomodations with huge bathrooms, super comfortable beds and air conditioning that works, a smart bar, great club like restaurant (better than Marks or George) and of course that famous tea room with an elegant clientel of glamorous Latins and a sprinkling of well heeled Americans."
July 2010,Splendid afternoon tea. Best afternoon tea in London.,"We did not stay at this hotel.  My boyfriend and I made a booking for afternoon tea. There is a grand piano quietly playing in the background of what they claim is the oldest hotel in London. Superb service and delicious sandwiches (egg, beef, salmon and cucumber, tomato and cheese, and another meat that I don't remember because I'm vegetarian and my boyfriend ate all three of the meat sandwiches). They were all good. The scones and petit fours were good and after all of that, they serve you a slice of cake. Make sure to skip lunch -- it's a lot of food and they keep replacing what you eat.  The teas all looked good and my boyfriend and I were both happy with our choices.  This is an expensive afternoon tea, but it's worth it. It was a lovely afternoon, and even though they said…"
June 2010,The quintessential afternoon tea...,"After visiting Brown's Hotel I felt compelled to share my experience so others can enjoy.The afternoon tea was fantastic and serves up to its prestige among the top in London. I chose the traditional afternoon tea with a selection of finely cut sandwiches and sweets. With a price tag that suits its location, every penny is worth it as you can select up to 17 different varieties of teas and enjoy a selection of sandwiches, all of which are replenished at no extra charge so you wont be leaving hungry. The service was just as good as the tea, discreet but attentive. An overall excellent experience and one not to be missed with friends, family or colleges."
July 2010,Perfection on a Plate,"My Canadian cousin and I decided to treat ourselves to Afternoon tea at Browns during a day's hard shopping. I have been before and knew she would like it. From the moment we arrived, we couldn't fault a thing. The service was impeccable.  Our tea and cakes arrived swiflty and were delicious, so much so that we didn't leave enough room for the cake trolley which came round a little later!  We loved the wide selection of teas and had a delightful chat with the tea 'sommelier'.  Our waitress was pleasant and attentive without being intrusive, and skilfully anticipated our needs, asking us if we wished more tea or sandwiches (which of course we did!).  We each tried a different tea the second time round, having spoken to the tea sommelier for ideas.  We were struck by the way in…"
July 2010,delightful delicious and dreamy,"what a afternoon to be had! the taste of warm buttery scones and the automatic indulgent teas were a absolute treat!the tea room was the perfect setting and all staff were helpful, friendly and accomindating.    a wonderful experience that will be repeated shortly!"
July 2010,The best place to celebrate a birthday,"I have recently stayed at browns to celebrate a friend’s 30th birthday, and staying at Browns really was the best way we could have celebrated. First of all the location is perfect, right next to all the best shops, restaurants, clubs and bars and the concierge were great in suggesting and organising fun venues for us to visit. From the moment we walked through the door, nothing was too much trouble. The staff were extremely welcoming and looked after us very well through out the course of our stay. Afternoon tea was a real treat, and for those not wanting to indulge too much they offer a ‘healthier’ option for tea, still every bit as delicious! The rooms were so comfortable, and not being a particularly good sleeper myself, I had one of the best night sleeps I have ever had! I…"
July 2010,Afternoon tea is a real treat         Buzzybee of Beaconsfield,"An oasis in the centre of London. The afternoon tea was a fabulously indulgent treat. The service was attentive, but discreet. The scones were light and delicious. We hadn't booked, and all the tables seemed to be reserved or occupied, but the staff were helpful and accommodating, and a table was found for the three of us. The relaxed and comfortable atmosphere added to the treat of a wonderful tea. Definitely worth another visit - will book ahead next time."
July 2010,Best afternoon tea,Went for afternoon tea and plumped for the champagne tea. I know It may look expensive on the out set but in this tight aberdonians opinion it was worth every penny and a must for anyone visiting london for a short while. atmosphere staff food tea all first class as you would expect.. well worth making a booking to avoid dissapointment..
June 2010,Friendly and extremely comfortable  stay,"We encountered  very good service nothing was too much trouble, the concierge was extremely efficient and quick. The room was spacious and comfortable no complaints at all. The location is just great very central for theatres, restaurants, places of interest to visit and of course the fabulous shopping!! You can certainly spend, spend, spend. We loved the Donovan Bar especially the older teenagers, the nights we spent there it had a real buzz. We also thoroughly enjoyed afternoon tea a must when in London and especially after a hard days shopping! We did book as it does get rather busy."
December 2009,The Best Hotel in London without a doubt,"When you walk into Browns, you are walking into your home from home!  From the moment you drive in, the door is opened with a smile and a welcome. Shortly after you are taken to reception without lifting a finger and again welcomed by a polite receptionists, were everything was taken care of.  The receptionist then took me to my room again with confidence and a smile; it made me feel right at home. When I entered the room my bags were already there, I didn't want to leave it I loved it!"
December 2009,superb on all levels,"fabulously comfortable beds, best bed linen ever, room spacious, chic and very well appointed (as was bathroom).  Service in the hotel is second to none, friendly and very efficient.  Delicious dinner in the restaurant and excellent cooked breakfast the following morning.  Definitely a huge treat to stay there."
December 2009,Excellent but expensive,"Brown's is well located 2 minutes off Piccadilly and well positioned for most of the West End. The room we had was excellent having upgraded to a Deluxe although it is possible to hear movements in the corridor and the room above. Staff were welcoming and generally efficient throughout except for the breakfast service which was average. So, a very comfortable place to experience London but I still cannot shrug off the feeling that the hotel is overpriced. Afternoon Tea at £37 per person is on the high side as is £12 for a single malt whisky and if you only want some fruit and a croissant for breakfast then £20 feels a bit steep. That said, we will be going back."
October 2009,Incredibly Impressed,"This was my first trip to Brown's. And I thought this hotel was just wonderful. I arrived early, a few hours before the alloted check-in time, and not only was my room ready but I was also given a free upgrade. The room itself was beautiful - and the bathroom was large, light and airy - everything you could want. The service I received from the check-in and Concierge staff was efficient and friendly. I really felt welcomed and valued. I would definitely return to Brown's."
November 2009,Perfect for 'second wedding' night with our boys staying too,"Browns is a perfect balance of luxury and style in a beautiful hotel and at the same time a very relaxing place to stay. We stayed for our wedding night, after a second wedding for both of us, so wanted to incude our teenage sons, so we had dinner in the Donovan bar which was really special and suited everyone. We could have happi;y stayed all weekend had we not had to deliver 2 boys to a school rugby match. A total haven in the middle of London and would highly recommend it in every way."
October 2009,Great hotel let down by poor service,"This a great hotel in the heart of Mayfair, well refurbished (if not to everyone's taste!). However, the hotel is let down by the really poor standard of service. Badly trained juniors abound. This carries through to the restaurant where good (though expensive) food is let down by the chaotic service that turned meals into a nervous disaster. Eat out."
November 2009,"Comfortable, homely and friendly","On first entering Browns Hotel you are greeted by a friendly helpful doorman. Your bags are then whisked away and you just walk through to the bar. Jazz music and comfortable seats then greet you as a waitor takes your order. The Browns club sandwich is the best sandwich I have ever tasted. The rooms are very homely and the beds very comfortable. The shower is like a waterfall lined with marble.    On leaving Browns, a taxi is called for you by the doorman and you are taken away in style.  So any downsides with browns? One-the heating in the rooms is up too high and it is very hard to turn it to an ideal temperature and the food is a little pricey. Other than that, Browns is a luxury."
November 2009,English posh with a modern edge...great!,"This was my first stay at Browns and it was excellent.  I checked in early from a US flight, they had been notified and had a room ready in 30 minutes.  Staff was very accommodating and could not have been friendlier.  Very international group works there and many languages were being spoken all around.  Concierges worked miracles with travel reservations as well as restaurants and shows. They never said no.   Location of this hotel was excellent and walking distance to Picadilly, Oxford Street, Regent Street and Bond Street.  Starbucks was close by as were sandwich shops Pret a Mange and EAT in case you did not want to have the $$ breakfast.  Breakfast was in excess of 30 pounds so I grabbed food at the sandwich shops right next door.  Could not have asked for a better…"
February 2007,"Tasteful, with character","It's rare for me to go somewhere relatively expensive and find it to be a bargain. Our room wasn't just designed, it had character and felt homely. It was full of thoughtful touches and came with a fantastic bed. The bathroom was bigger than some hotel rooms I've stayed at. Staff were charming and made that extra effort. Great breakfast as well - it set me up for the day. I'm trying really hard to think of a negative (I only trust tripadvisor reviews with some criticism) and I think it was possible the toast was overbrowned.....But if I'd have frowned at the toast they'd have whisked it away and replaced it."
September 2009,Classy hotel in the middle of Mayfair,"Stayed here for 4 nights. We arrived late due to a delayed flight. Staff were on hand to quickly check us in so we could get some sleep. Breakfast the next morning was excellent. I noticed that the waiters seemed nervous, and almost too eager.  Rooms are very tastefully decorated. The water pressure in the bathroom was surprisingly low, but I think that this is a general problem in central London. Did not get to try high tea, something this hotel is famous for. One normally has to book. The concierge was very helpful in managing to find tickets for sell-out musical. Bar is stylish, and the bartender knows how to mix a mean caiprinha. All in all a great hotel"
February 2009,Best Afternoon tea in London.,"I have enjoyed Afternoon tea here about 10 times – it is with out compartment my favourite afternoon tea place in London.  Delicious, well prepared, good location, and most important of all…. Excellent service!  They only charge ½ price for children.  Worth every penny, and I will look forward to my next afternoon tea here."
December 2008,"Luxurious experience, will be back soon","Browns has an ideal location tucked away in Mayfair. The staff are efficient and very welcoming. My bedroom was very comfortable, beautiful bed linen and ample toiletries.  Doyble glazing meant had a grreat nights sleep. Great breakfast too."
December 2008,Lovely Hotel with Excellent staff,"We stayed on the 'Romantic Package' to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  The telephone booking directly with the hotel was very efficient and friendly, and having visited the restaurant many years ago before the refurbishment we were looking forward to seeing the new decor.  The changes did not disappoint and the hotel has a serene atmosphere.  The doorman was welcoming and walked us to reception where the young lady was equally as nice.  We did book in at 2pm so our room was ready and after a tour of the public rooms (which are gorgeous) we were shown to our room on the 2nd floor.  Don't ask me why but I was disappointed, it was beautifully furnished but despite asking for a quiet room it overlooked Dover Street with lots of passing traffic, however good for people watching…"
November 2008,5 Star,"Stayed at Browns for 1 night as part of the Romantic retreat package. It was a special occassion as I planned to propose to my girlfriend. Prior to the trip I was in contact with Guest Relations to organise various things to make the proposal more special. Maria who I dealt with was superb and could not be more helpful. In addition to the various request I made, Maria was there on arrival to meet us, the icing on the cake was that she managed to uprage our room from a junior suite to a classic suite....thanks. The room was very large 80 square metres...a lounge with 3 seater couch a bang and oulufson plasma, a separate massive bedroom with another B&O tv and a huge bathroom with you have guessed it another B&O Tv in the bath... Decor is contemporary but yet classical. The whole…"
November 2008,Five Star with a caveat,"The most important thing about Brown's is that they are true to their reputation: They are one of the most welcoming and friendly hotels in the world.  The thing that will strike you is that everyone there is really nice and customer oriented.  It doesn't have the air of pretentiousness you find in some 5-star hotels (I say this as someone who stays almost exclusively in 5-star hotels) - instead it feels like you are at home and with friends.  The more you stay there the more striking this becomes.  The hotel itself is also excellent:  Rooms: The rooms including many of the standard rooms are spacious, comfortable and well appointed.  Many of the rooms have high pressure rain-showers which are absolutely fantastic.  The beds are probably the best hotel beds I have slept on in…"
October 2008,Good but with flaws,"Stayed with my wife for a ""Romantic Retreat"" week-end, after a nice week-end earlier this year at Sir Rocco Forte's Hotel de Rome in Berlin, Germany.  The good:  Location is excellent Staff is very friendly and professionel English break-fast is as it should be (fresh, plenty,...) Room was luxurious (received as part of our package upgrade to an executive room), spacious and silent. Bed was very good. The spa treatments were heavenly they make their Manhattan cocktail just ""perfect""  The ""bad"":  our ""bottle of Champagne, fresh fruit and chocolate strawberries upon arrival in your room"" arrived the second (!) day and only after asking ourselves twice. The fruit were 3 basis apples and the strawberries just never arrived.  temperature in the public spaces is too high and also in…"
September 2008,Amazing Stay,"I was impressed with everything. The rooms were tastefully decorated, the bed extremely comfortable and the service impeccable, the concierge extremely helpful and well-informed. I requested a SIM card and was provided with one within 15minutes. It was an amazing stay in all its aspects. I usually stay at the intercontinental hotel and stayed at the Browns due its excellent location near Bond Street. Will stay there again, there is no doubt about this."
October 2008,Fine but overrated,"Brown hotel has a good location if you want to go to the theatres and shop. Nevertheless the service comes short of what you would expect of a five star hotel.   The design is good, contemporary which we enjoy , but a little cheap and quickly put together with lots of black and white phtographs but nothing much more.   The problem is that in London you cannot find many contemporary hotels with good locations. In that respect it has an advantage. We used it once for lunch and once for afternoon tea. Both experiences were fine but nothing you cannot find in many more places in London.   Would I go back. Maybe if the price was right. You can find great discounts on the hotel through some websites. I woul make sure I discuss the room with the reservation girl on the phone as it also…"
September 2007,A Great Treat,"The hotel is outstanding, a definate 5 Star.   We had room service which was amazing. They set up a full table which had its own hot cupboard.  The spa treatments were very good and relaxing, I had the Jet Lag Treatment which was very much needed.  Breakfast was perfect with a great buffet and lovely menu. All the staff were fantastic.   The location of this hotel is perfect for shopping."
August 2008,Pretty close to superb,"If your are into style its your hotel. everything which belongs to design is pretty classy and nice. the service was ok (the front desk made it lose a bit). the rooms was nice but a bit small. the location is great. overall, i would stay there again, but its also not a fault to keep your eyes open for other hotels..."
August 2008,A lovely hotel to stay at,"My daughter and I just returned from a week at Brown's and found it to be a really nice hotel overall.  We had a suite with plenty of room (what a nice luxury in London!), very comfy beds (I actually miss mine!) and great service. The breakfasts were good too (try the cappucino-and all that delicious fresh fruit) although I didn't have the stomach for the heavy English breakfast like my daughter did. My only caveat would be the tea there; we found the food not that good for the  $$ price and the seats were uncomfortable for anybody over 5'2"" (at 5'8"" my legs had nowhere to go!) That being said, I would stay at Brown's anytime-one of the best!"
May 2008,Worth the wait,"Just stayed at this hotel for one night to celebrate twentieth wedding anniversary. Had booked the ""Romantic Retreats"" package directly with the hotel. Check-in was from 2pm and true to the package description my wife, as we were arriving seperately due to work commitments, was offered an upgrade  from an Executive King to an Executive Deluxe. She was given the further option to wait a bit longer and upgrade even further to a Classic Suite and after some telephone consulatation we chose to wait for the Suite! My wife was shown to the Donovan Bar, read her book, people watched, and drank tea, coffee and a gin and tonic. Unfortunely the wait dragged on as the hotel was having a problem extracting the previous guest. The wait ended up being just under three hours but because we, I…"
May 2008,From Mayfair with Love,"The name’s Trott ..., Charles Trott... well, it might not sound quite as thrilling as Bond’s familiar greeting, but seeing as I was checking in on a ‘For Your Eyes Only’ 007 style break at Brown’s Hotel in Mayfair, I thought it only appropriate to break the ice in time honoured fashion. Fans of Ian Fleming’s sophisticated secret serviceman may already know that 2008 is the 100th anniversary of the author’s birth. To commemorate the occasion The Imperial War Museum in Lambeth is running a special Ian Fleming exhibition documenting the great man’s life and featuring the fictional world of his legendary hero. Brown’s hit upon the idea of running a Bond break during which fans could take in the exhibition and experience a little of the glamour and excitement that life in Bond’s fast…"
March 2008,not bad,Stayed at the Browns for one night in May.The front desk was very efficient and helpful.I had a very large and spacious room. I don't find the bathrooms very 5 star.Somehow  the shower and floor looked very used.The bed is definitely one of the most comfortable ones I have slept in.Great quilt. Overall a good but expensive experience.
February 2008,Meh,"MOLD IN THE SHOWERS!!!   Need I say more?   I used to love this hotel, but post renovation is just a complete flop. Browns used to have charm now all they have, are bad post modern semi comfortable rooms. It is rather unfortunate as this used to be a regular stop for me, but now I will be looking at alternative hotels for my stays in London.   If you're looking for a well situated luxury hotel, you have found it. If you're looking for a well priced luxury hotel that is appealing to the eye as well this is the wrong place for you."
January 2008,Classic British Hotel in a great location,"I just spent a night on a business trips in Brown's a hotel by the Rocco Forte Hotels.  This is a classic London Hotel in a great Mayfair location, so great for business and luxury shopping.  The rooms are huge and well equipped, although I would have liked a separate shower, and the lack of Wi-Fi connection is an issue at this price range in my opinion.   Staff are helpful and efficient.  The two small issues are: they have refurbished the hotel recently and I beleive the new furniture added does not match the period features of the hotel, it is neither modern and minimal nor classic- it is just not classy in my opinion. The another-the breakfast: I ordered an English breakfast and thankfully arrived fairly early, because it arrived 25 minutes after my order. I think that is…"
February 2007,'No nonsense' luxury with competence,"Having stayed at several great 5* hotels in London it was with some hesitation that I took my secretary's advice and booked my first stay at Brown's. I had a very good week as a guest at the hotel.  Location: smack in the middle of Mayfair with Bond St around the corner. St James's just down the road, Piccadilly and Soho very near. In other words a very central location.  Room: Fresh and modern without being arty minimalist. Wooden floors, white walls. Large bathroom. Views will never be great as it is on a Mayfair street and all houses incl hotel are low rise (5-6 floors I think). Bathroom is spacious and comfortable. Good shower pressure.   The feeling of the hotel is quite unique for London I think. I find hotels like Lanesborough and Claridges be old and stuffy - one can…"
December 2007,Pretty good,"my family and i stayed there for 9 days and it was overall very nice. The concierge was very helpful and friendly but not always correct. the rooms were nice but certain amentidies altough were requested before our stay were not met until mid-week. the tea-room is very nice and the staff was so polite and understanding. it was a cozy hotel and very comfortable. i, being a ""child"" was not repremanded about being in the hallways at 1:00 am in the morning even though a staff member saw me. that was very undeerstanding of him. the room service for breakfeast was quite nice. i would recommend the resturaunt in the hotel. All the staff down to even the doorman was very curtious. i also loved the bathrooms. perfect for taking a bath! Great place to stay!!!!"
November 2007,Great Dining Experience,"We dined in the restaurant at Browns in the week before Christmas and enjoyed a superb evening.  To begin, we sampled some cocktails in the bar before going through to eat. The maitre d' (David) welcomed us warmly and ensured that we had excellent service.  The staff were charming and utterly professional, with that rare combination of being attentive without being intrusive.  I had the scallops which were delicious, and the treacle tart with clotted cream was to die for.  The ambience in the restaurant was just right: elegant, buzzy (but not noisy) and with a sense that you were at the heart of things.  For us it was a perfect mix of great food and great atmosphere and we would certainly recommend."
January 2008,Best of London,Browns is great hotel for visiting London. Perfectly situated near to everything including the three Parks for morning runs. Staff is friendly and charming making things happen looks so easy. The concierge desk is great - with good connections and well organised service. Have stayed in three - four different rooms and all are of the best standard with very comfortable beds. Have become our preferred hotel in London without any competition.  Clearly pricey but value for what you pay for.
November 2007,Just perfect,Couldn't fault anything. It was perfect. Was given an upgrade to the deluxe rooms on our arrival. Our expectations were exceeded in every way.
December 2007,"Not a 1 star, Not a 5 star, somewhere in between","I recently stayed at Browns for business - it is a preferred provider for my company.  After coming in very late on a Sunday, I was unable to utilize the dry cleaning service to press my shirts. I asked for an iron. Low and behold I use the iron on my white shirt and rust marks appear on it. Now I don't want to sound like a cocky foreigner, but shouldn't a 5 star hotel have top of the line irons - e.g. Stainless Steel Rowentas? If you're wondering if I don't know how to iron or not, I assure you being raised by my mother, I do. If you're also wondering if this iron was special circumstance, it wasn't, I asked for another one and had an even WORSE problem.  But wait, the story gets better. So the next day I submit my custom shirt for dry cleaning (and go to my meeting in a…"
November 2007,Brown Sugar Fantastic,"Our stay was a delight from the moment we arrived with the smell of christmas from candles and the subtle smells of lunchtime food. The attentiveness was measured but not overdone and the balance of old and new in the architecture and ambience made the atmosphere. We have stayed in many hotels around the world but we both said how we enjoyed the brief stay. Great rooms, great comfortable beds ,a massage that my wife (who is an expert) thoght was great) excellent service and good value -we have already booked again!!"
November 2007,Absolutely Wonderful!,"Having stayed at the Ritz in the summer, it was an amazing contrast to see how the Fortes have revamped 'the oldest hotel in London.'  From the moment of arrival, the courtesy and service was of a level never experienced at the Ritz or any other 5 star plus hotel.  The Staff were amazing: remembering your name, genuine and eager to please - no stuffy, unsmiling personnel here. The ethos of Browns, must be  - The Guest is King - as that it is the way we were treated!  The beds were fantastic with the most wonderful pillows ever.  The decor designed by Olga Polizzi, is contemporary but classy.  Books and magazines are arranged as if you were in your own home, with an almost constant supply of water, both still and sparkling, generously provided.  A fresh bowl of fruit was…"
November 2007,Great Hotel,This is great boutique hotel. Great check in and concierge service. The rates are usually high but you should look for specials rocco forte is having. I never had high tea here but had drinks at the bar and they were great. really great location. Rooms were spacious and well appointed. Check this hotel out you will not be disappointed.
October 2007,Great,"Even not as trendy as a Hempel or a Blake's, the Brown's is a nearly perfect place to stay in London. The staff is very helpful and friendly, the rooms are decorated with taste and sophistication. The location is great is if you like to stay near Picadilly and Bond St. Good breakfast too. I will return with pleasure. Of course, it's not cheap. But where do you think you are? Still It worthes every penny."
September 2007,Slightly disappointed by Brown's,"I stayed at Brown's early Oct, and was slightly disappointed. Maybe I was expecting too much. However, given the 5 stars and price, I think I was entitled to expect something good!  Check-In: There was no record of my reservation when i arrived, even though my company travel agent assured me it was booked. There was a definite sense from the check-in staff that it was most definitely my mistake and not theirs (and tough luck there were no more rooms anyway). In the end, the managed to find the reservation and gave me a room.   Room: The room was good - nice comfy bed, sofas and table, good size bathroom and walk in wardrobe. It was a slightly strange L shape, but was good and nicely furnished  Noise: My room was above the bar and there was loud music going on all evening (a…"
September 2007,Better than expected,After some of the reviews here i was a little apprehensive about my hotel choice but overall it was a good experience. The check in was quick and professional- our room was ready early as requested which was quite a plus-  the rooms were nice and large with nice bathrooms- no complaints about the room decor- though one of our rooms faced a back alley with the air conditioner units below- was quiet but for the price not quite the view i expected- the staff were very helpful offering to help pack and unpack and take our shopping bags up for us-  fresh bottles of water every night bedside-  bar was busy every night - nice breakfast buffet (not included)-   great location near tube and short walk to buckingham palace and  shopping right outside the door. Only complaint  no wi-fi and…
July 2007,"Good, but not quite 5 star","Stayed here last week and while the stay was enjoyable, there were little touches that just didn't feel right.  1 -  We had a bottle of wine in our room on arrival and drank it before going out to a concert that night. When we came back, despite Housekeeping having been in the room and tidied, the empty bottle, glasses and tray remained until Morning  2 - Bathrooms - Firstly, the toilets don't flush properly. They do the job, but only after flushing twice, which is annoying. Also, the bath seemed to be shaped perfectly to make you slide down and drown, which, coupled with the lack of properly hot water, meant that when I wanted to relax with a soak, I just couldn't.  Don't get me wrong, it's a fine hotel, with a perfect location, but if you're expecting a true five star…"
June 2007,Great in many ways,"My wife and I stayed at Brown's in late July and found the young staff very helpful.  The location is excellent (the Green Park tube is very near).  We had a very nice room that was off the street and found it to be very quite.  My wife enjoyed the spa and I used the excerise room.  The restaurant was being refurbished while we were there, so we did not eat at the hotel, but found several small/ resonable eating establishments nearby.  The only problem at this time is the pound to dollar relationship set our room rate at around $650.00 a night- ugh. "
June 2007,Very dissappointing,"Although the location is great and the hotel exterior is very charming and the interior is modern, the staff are friendly, yet completely inept. It seems that the whole place is run entirely by entry level staff who are not well trained or supervised. For example, the conceriege does not know where basic sites are/ or how to get there (it seems much of the staff are new to the UK). They don't even know to anticipate how to get taxi cabs on busy days. The restaurant staff bring cold food to your table. Bell boys are very obviously only looking for tips rather than focusing on service. Where is top management?  Also, the rooms are very small. We got an upgrade and it was still extremely tiny. For the price, it's a sham. "
June 2006,very expensive,"Very disappointed with the hotel experience. Have stayed in Claridges, Barclay and Dorchester so do have some experience in luxury and attention to detail. On arrival at 11pm at night even though booked a King bed room for 7 nights was shown to 1st floor way out the back room looking on to internal ugly venting and of course no King bed seen. Was then told they had no other rooms. That night as it was late we accepted this and went to sleep. We were assured it would be attended to the next day. The next day no one contacted us we contacted them twice and finally we were given some attention. We were shown 2 other rooms both looking out on to the internal view with 1 small window finally they put us into a room with the street view still with no King bed, then an arguement…"
May 2007,"Beautiful hotel, old-London atmosphere","Brown's is a beautiful old-London style hotel that has been wonderfully renovated within the last few years.  The Mayfair location can't be beat, the rooms are luxurious though vary widely in size (all have the same amenities) and the staff is the definition of excellence.  Most rooms have sofas/sitting areas, spa-style bathrooms and great finishing touches.  It's an expensive hotel but worth it's cost and a great location for a business traveller.  Tea or drinks in the bar is a definite must if time permits. "
April 2007,"Great Hotel, Great Service, in the Center of London","This is one of the top hotels for servie and location.    Location:  Onle block from Piccadilly St, between Bond and Dover.  Five minute walk from Shepherds Market if you are up for good food.  Five minutes walk in the opposite direction to Trafalgar Sq.  Rooms:  I saw criticism of their rooms in previous comments and I find this criticism unfounded.  While the room size will depend on the rate you pay, all romms I stayed at were comfortable and reasonable size.  See pictures of the room I am staying in now.    Beds:  Heavenly.  Soft, perfect beds.  Thick, clean-smelling goose down blankets and poillows.  Blankets are in duvets instead of sheets.  Thick, snow-white cotton sheets.    Cleanliness:  Pristine, The turn-down service actually includes room cleaning.    Service:…"
March 2007,Unexpectedly Average,"We stayed at Brown's for three nights. While the neighborhood is convenient, the hotel was unexpectedly average.   The room decor was a bit understated and lacked personality. The highlight of the room was the bed, which was heaven to sleep in. Breakfast was average and we were over charged for items and brought incorrect items as well. My partner's massage booking was bungled and he didn't receive the services he'd initially booked.   I asked for an voltage converter, and received an archaic looking piece of equipment which promptly blew a fuse in our room. A replacement or more modern converter was not procured.   I see no reason to stay here again, nor would I suggest it to friends. "
March 2007,Great hotel,"A great night in luxury. We were upgraded because as the rather indiscreet receptionist told us the hotel was only at 17% occupancy and last month was 'even worse'. Anyway,  whether it was the rarity of guests or not, our stay could not have been better. An amazing suite, wonderful surroundings, friendly but not casual staff who went the extra mile in all respects. Highly recommended. "
October 2006,London Gem,"Stayed at the Brown's for one night. Was greeted warmly at the entrance and shown the way to reception. Staff was very friendly and informative. We were given a short tour of the hotel before being shown to our rooms. The staff member showed me all ammenities of the room before leaving. I attempted to give him a tip but was told that this was not neccesary. Classy.. Room was on the 5th floorand was very nicely decorated. Bathrooms was roomy and nely refurbished. Comfortable bed with down comforters. Very good service through our entire stay from the doorman to the maids. Only small thing that could have been better was breakfast. The breakfast buffet was a little ""thin"". It was possible to order from the a lacarte grill menu, something we did, but I personally prefer a buffet.…"
September 2006,Our new favorite hotel,"We have been traveling to London for some time, and had the luxury of staying in many of London's better hotels. We have never had a true favorite, until we decided to stay at Brown's.  The hotel is  well located near Oxford street and easy to catch the tube at Bond st or a taxi. The hotel spans 2 streets Albermarle and Dover streets, while in a busy part of London, these 2 streets are realitively quiet and peaceful. The hotel itself upon entering it is very understated, with reception being located near the center of the hotel. The staff was personable and professional, while our room wasnt quite ready (they never are). The front desk took my mobile # and called me when the room was ready. Our room was on the 4th floor on the Dover St side of the building. We like our space, I…"
August 2006,Warm Hospitality with Style,"Upon arrival we received a very warm welcome, and appreciated good hospitality throughout from the management and staff during our entire stay. Our suite was magnificent, with a bathroom to die for. We had a wonderful traditional dining experience, including smoked salmon (carved at the table) and particularly enjoyed the potted shrimps together with some interesting dishes from the grill. To sum up, this is a great hotel and we would recommend it due to all the above mentioned points, and of course it's fabulous location for Bond Street Shopping! "
September 2006,Minimalist designer fails to provide storage,"We stayed at Browns Hotel in August 2006, anxious to experience the much advertised makeover.  We found the public areas delightful, well staffed, with a sprinkling of celebrities coming and going to tea in the afternoons.  The glitz and glamour of traditional London in the public areas is complemented in the rooms by a very stylish minimalist decor.  On first viewing the room is outstanding in its appearance.  Once you are inside with two suitcases and a couple of pieces of hand luggage, it is very apparent that there is virtually no storage.  I measured height of the four drawer cabinet, and found that each drawer was two inches high..........i.e, a folded pair of jeans just fits.  Add a couple of  T shirts and the drawer is full.  We put one of our suitcases in the wardrobe. …"
December 2023,"timeless style, pure quality","This is simple, timeless style for intelligent people. During my 24-hour stay,  I quickly felt at home, could find what was were. The bedroom light switches are  simply switches, not complicated electronic panels. I found and could work the  safe, the shower controls. At the desk, broadband was instant, light was good.  The timeless effect of antiques, serious hardback books as well as current top  international glossy magazines was mentally elevating. Dinner was that rare  classic, proper historic English food - but with designer ingredients (Temple  Farm chicken from Hatfield, crab from Dorset), perfectly cooked and served. The  breakfast buffet is sheer quality - rather than gargantuan quantity - and  coffee best anywhere, for months. The gym is fine, and I also borrowed a…"
December 2023,"Brown's is a lovely, elegant hotel","A lovely elegant hotel: low-key, quiet, understated, well-located.  The staff is gracious and accomodating without being the slightest bit intrusive - they go above and beyond for their guests.  We felt pampered and cared for.  The room was clean and comfortable, with a lovely bathroom and amenities.  The price is to be expected for a major city hotel of this quality.  We will return."
December 2023,A home away from home,"Our recent stay at Browns just prior to Christmas was wonderful. We had lots of logistics to deal with having various family members arriving but staying elsewhere, Christmas shopping to do, restaurant plans that kept changing, all in the busy chaos of London at Christmas but the staff were always so helpful and welcoming. They truly seemed to care about us and went out of their way to help with everything. The breakfast was superb especially the French toast and the best coffee and tea we had in London. When we first arrived in our room we thought that it wasn’t anything special but it was comfortable - great bed, clean and had everything you need. It’s the service that makes Browns special. Would definitely return."
December 2023,"Excellent, Hotel","Excellent Hotel, wonderful staff friendly breakfast was amazing service very friendly professional overall definitely 100%. The beds are so comfortable great room service very clean. I definitely would return  "
December 2023,Awesome family Christmas stay at Brown’s ,Wonderful hotel with superb staff. A special thanks to Givi who was always around to help us out. The location in the heart of Mayfair is perfect for business or hitting all the fantastic nearby shops. 
December 2023,Exceeded our high expectations,"The hotel exceeded our high expectations in all respects. The staff could not have looked after us better, and when my wife was not well, were very attentive. Particular mention for front desk, doorman and room service. The style and ambience of the hotel is as good as you could hope for a 5 star traditional London hotel, and the room was a pleasure to  stay in. The bed was very, very comfortable.  Food and drink great, including some kindly provided FOC as they knew we were celebrating a big birthday. Have booked again for our next celebration!"
December 2023,Perfect in every way!,"Perfect in every way from check-in till the to check-out. The hotel is perfect situated and decorated with love for details. Amazing breakfast. The entire staff from the front office to the restaurant were super friendly, professional and always ready to help! I especially remember Charles & Mamadou at the front desk. I felt like at home!"
December 2023,Amazing Spa,"Spa was the most relaxing experience. We had the mother and daughter treatment, and my 8 year old daughter enjoyed it as much as I did. Aurora & Fouzia are amazing!!! They are like wizards. We made it out Christmas tradition and will be coming again!"
December 2023,Luxurious Get Away,What an absolutely charming hotel! Our room was gorgeous and comfortable. But what I loved most was that the concierge team reached out to us prior to our arrival and were very responsive in helping with arrangements before we arrived. Everyone we interacted with during our stay was so lovely and welcoming. And the cocktails at the Dononvan Bar are to die for! We would love to stay at Brown's again. 
November 2023,World Class Hotel,An incredibly beautiful historic hotel with luxury written all over it. Lovely suite with all the modern necessities. Absolutely fantastic service - from the moment the taxi pulled up outside - until the moment I left the Hotel. Staff were exemplary and so friendly and helpful. I will definitely come again.
December 2023,Welcome to your London home,"Took my family to London for Thanksgiving week and couldn't be happier with our stay at Brown's.  From the moment we arrived the staff worked to make us comfortable.  We arrived around 10am from NY and were tired and needed to change.  Our rooms were not ready, but they had a room where we could change and freshen up.   They recommended a quaint lunch place down the street and by the time we finished the rooms were ready.    The location was amazing.  Steps from Bond Street (great shopping) and a simple walk from all the parks, castles and other places you want to visit when you go to London.     The rooms were much larger than we expected from a European hotel.  Many of the hotels we have stayed in are tiny, but these were very comfortable.  We stayed in rooms 203 and 204.   203 has a sitting area and a huge closet and bathroom.  204 was slightly smaller but in no way was it small.  The in-room amenities are very good.   We received water each day as well as a welcome basket of fruit and chocolate truffles.  The bathroom was modern and spacious.  The beds were comfortable, and even though we were on the second-floor sleeping was not an issue.     The staff is an 11 out of 10.  They are the most professional and friendly people you can meet.  They truly care about you and want to make you feel like you are at home.  A perfect example of how they go out of their way to make you comfortable is on Thanksgiving they sent us pieces of pumpkin pie because they knew we weren't in the US celebrating.  At every turn they were there to help or just ask how everything was going.  We wanted to see a show but failed to get tickets before we arrived but that wasn't an issue.  They called around and gave us a list of potential shows and costs.  Once we decided on a show, they arranged everything.  Truely seamless.    The restaurants were great.  We ate breakfast at the hotel each morning and it was wonderful.  We also had a late dinner one night very close to their closing time, but we weren't rushed our treated poorly due to the late hour.  In fact, they said they were there for us and would stay as long as we wanted.    We also had afternoon tea, and this was a great meal.   Donovan's Bar was out of this world.  The drinks, atmosphere and staff are why this bar is considered one of the top 100 bars in the world.   If you want to feel at home in London, I highly recommend Brown's.  We will never stay anywhere else.    …"

They truly seemed to care about us and went out of their way to help with everything. The breakfast was superb especially the French toast and the best coffee and tea we had in London. When we first arrived in our room we thought that it wasn’t anything special but it was comfortable - great bed, clean and had everything you need. It’s the service that makes Browns special. Would definitely return."
December 2023,"Excellent, Hotel","Excellent Hotel, wonderful staff friendly breakfast was amazing service very friendly professional overall definitely 100%. The beds are so comfortable great room service very clean. I definitely would return  "
December 2023,Awesome family Christmas stay at Brown’s ,Wonderful hotel with superb staff. A special thanks to Givi who was always around to help us out. The location in the heart of Mayfair is perfect for business or hitting all the fantastic nearby shops. 
December 2023,Exceeded our high expectations,"The hotel exceeded our high expectations in all respects. The staff could not have looked after us better, and when my wife was not well, were very attentive. Particular mention for front desk, doorman and room service. The style and ambience of the hotel is as good as you could hope for a 5 star traditional London hotel, and the room was a pleasure to  stay in. The bed was very, very comfortable.  Food and drink great, including some kindly provided FOC as they knew we were celebrating a big birthday. Have booked again for our next celebration!"
December 2023,Perfect in every way!,"Perfect in every way from check-in till the to check-out. The hotel is perfect situated and decorated with love for details. Amazing breakfast. The entire staff from the front office to the restaurant were super friendly, professional and always ready to help! I especially remember Charles & Mamadou at the front desk. I felt like at home!"
December 2023,Amazing Spa,"Spa was the most relaxing experience. We had the mother and daughter treatment, and my 8 year old daughter enjoyed it as much as I did. Aurora & Fouzia are amazing!!! They are like wizards. We made it out Christmas tradition and will be coming again!"
December 2023,Luxurious Get Away,What an absolutely charming hotel! Our room was gorgeous and comfortable. But what I loved most was that the concierge team reached out to us prior to our arrival and were very responsive in helping with arrangements before we arrived. Everyone we interacted with during our stay was so lovely and welcoming. And the cocktails at the Dononvan Bar are to die for! We would love to stay at Brown's again. 
November 2023,World Class Hotel,An incredibly beautiful historic hotel with luxury written all over it. Lovely suite with all the modern necessities. Absolutely fantastic service - from the moment the taxi pulled up outside - until the moment I left the Hotel. Staff were exemplary and so friendly and helpful. I will definitely come again.
December 2023,Welcome to your London home,"Took my family to London for Thanksgiving week and couldn't be happier with our stay at Brown's.  From the moment we arrived the staff worked to make us comfortable.  We arrived around 10am from NY and were tired and needed to change.  Our rooms were not ready, but they had a room where we could change and freshen up.   They recommended a quaint lunch place down the street and by the time we finished the rooms were ready.    The location was amazing.  Steps from Bond Street (great shopping) and a simple walk from all the parks, castles and other places you want to visit when you go to London.     The rooms were much larger than we expected from a European hotel.  Many of the hotels we have stayed in are tiny, but these were very comfortable.  We stayed in rooms 203 and 204.   203 has a sitting area and a huge closet and bathroom.  204 was slightly smaller but in no way was it small.  The in-room amenities are very good.   We received water each day as well as a welcome basket of fruit and chocolate truffles.  The bathroom was modern and spacious.  The beds were comfortable, and even though we were on the second-floor sleeping was not an issue.     The staff is an 11 out of 10.  They are the most professional and friendly people you can meet.  They truly care about you and want to make you feel like you are at home.  A perfect example of how they go out of their way to make you comfortable is on Thanksgiving they sent us pieces of pumpkin pie because they knew we weren't in the US celebrating.  At every turn they were there to help or just ask how everything was going.  We wanted to see a show but failed to get tickets before we arrived but that wasn't an issue.  They called around and gave us a list of potential shows and costs.  Once we decided on a show, they arranged everything.  Truely seamless.    The restaurants were great.  We ate breakfast at the hotel each morning and it was wonderful.  We also had a late dinner one night very close to their closing time, but we weren't rushed our treated poorly due to the late hour.  In fact, they said they were there for us and would stay as long as we wanted.    We also had afternoon tea, and this was a great meal.   Donovan's Bar was out of this world.  The drinks, atmosphere and staff are why this bar is considered one of the top 100 bars in the world.   If you want to feel at home in London, I highly recommend Brown's.  We will never stay anywhere else.    …"
December 2023,"Brown's is a lovely, elegant hotel","A lovely elegant hotel: low-key, quiet, understated, well-located.  The staff is gracious and accomodating without being the slightest bit intrusive - they go above and beyond for their guests.  We felt pampered and cared for.

From the moment we arrived the staff worked to make us comfortable.  We arrived around 10am from NY and were tired and needed to change.  Our rooms were not ready, but they had a room where we could change and freshen up.   They recommended a quaint lunch place down the street and by the time we finished the rooms were ready.    The location was amazing.  Steps from Bond Street (great shopping) and a simple walk from all the parks, castles and other places you want to visit when you go to London.     The rooms were much larger than we expected from a European hotel.  Many of the hotels we have stayed in are tiny, but these were very comfortable.  We stayed in rooms 203 and 204.   203 has a sitting area and a huge closet and bathroom.  204 was slightly smaller but in no way was it small.  The in-room amenities are very good.   We received water each day as well as a welcome basket of fruit and chocolate truffles.  The bathroom was modern and spacious.  The beds were comfortable, and even though we were on the second-floor sleeping was not an issue.     The staff is an 11 out of 10.  They are the most professional and friendly people you can meet.  They truly care about you and want to make you feel like you are at home.  A perfect example of how they go out of their way to make you comfortable is on Thanksgiving they sent us pieces of pumpkin pie because they knew we weren't in the US celebrating.  At every turn they were there to help or just ask how everything was going.  We wanted to see a show but failed to get tickets before we arrived but that wasn't an issue.  They called around and gave us a list of potential shows and costs.  Once we decided on a show, they arranged everything.  Truely seamless.    The restaurants were great.  We ate breakfast at the hotel each morning and it was wonderful.  We also had a late dinner one night very close to their closing time, but we weren't rushed our treated poorly due to the late hour.  In fact, they said they were there for us and would stay as long as we wanted.    We also had afternoon tea, and this was a great meal.   Donovan's Bar was out of this world.  The drinks, atmosphere and staff are why this bar is considered one of the top 100 bars in the world.   If you want to feel at home in London, I highly recommend Brown's.  We will never stay anywhere else.    …"
December 2023,"Brown's is a lovely, elegant hotel","A lovely elegant hotel: low-key, quiet, understated, well-located.  The staff is gracious and accomodating without being the slightest bit intrusive - they go above and beyond for their guests.  We felt pampered and cared for.  The room was clean and comfortable, with a lovely bathroom and amenities.  The price is to be expected for a major city hotel of this quality.  We will return."
December 2023,A home away from home,"Our recent stay at Browns just prior to Christmas was wonderful. We had lots of logistics to deal with having various family members arriving but staying elsewhere, Christmas shopping to do, restaurant plans that kept changing, all in the busy chaos of London at Christmas but the staff were always so helpful and welcoming. They truly seemed to care about us and went out of their way to help with everything. The breakfast was superb especially the French toast and the best coffee and tea we had in London. When we first arrived in our room we thought that it wasn’t anything special but it was comfortable - great bed, clean and had everything you need. It’s the service that makes Browns special. Would definitely return."

December 2023,Awesome family Christmas stay at Brown’s ,Wonderful hotel with superb staff. A special thanks to Givi who was always around to help us out. The location in the heart of Mayfair is perfect for business or hitting all the fantastic nearby shops. 
December 2023,Exceeded our high expectations,"The hotel exceeded our high expectations in all respects. The staff could not have looked after us better, and when my wife was not well, were very attentive. Particular mention for front desk, doorman and room service. The style and ambience of the hotel is as good as you could hope for a 5 star traditional London hotel, and the room was a pleasure to  stay in. The bed was very, very comfortable.  Food and drink great, including some kindly provided FOC as they knew we were celebrating a big birthday. Have booked again for our next celebration!"
December 2023,Perfect in every way!,"Perfect in every way from check-in till the to check-out. The hotel is perfect situated and decorated with love for details. Amazing breakfast. The entire staff from the front office to the restaurant were super friendly, professional and always ready to help! I especially remember Charles & Mamadou at the front desk. I felt like at home!"
December 2023,Amazing Spa,"Spa was the most relaxing experience. We had the mother and daughter treatment, and my 8 year old daughter enjoyed it as much as I did. Aurora & Fouzia are amazing!!! They are like wizards. We made it out Christmas tradition and will be coming again!"
December 2023,Luxurious Get Away,What an absolutely charming hotel! Our room was gorgeous and comfortable. But what I loved most was that the concierge team reached out to us prior to our arrival and were very responsive in helping with arrangements before we arrived. Everyone we interacted with during our stay was so lovely and welcoming. And the cocktails at the Dononvan Bar are to die for! We would love to stay at Brown's again.

The room was clean and comfortable, with a lovely bathroom and amenities.  The price is to be expected for a major city hotel of this quality.  We will return."
December 2023,A home away from home,"Our recent stay at Browns just prior to Christmas was wonderful. We had lots of logistics to deal with having various family members arriving but staying elsewhere, Christmas shopping to do, restaurant plans that kept changing, all in the busy chaos of London at Christmas but the staff were always so helpful and welcoming. They truly seemed to care about us and went out of their way to help with everything. The breakfast was superb especially the French toast and the best coffee and tea we had in London. When we first arrived in our room we thought that it wasn’t anything special but it was comfortable - great bed, clean and had everything you need. It’s the service that makes Browns special. Would definitely return."
December 2023,"Excellent, Hotel","Excellent Hotel, wonderful staff friendly breakfast was amazing service very friendly professional overall definitely 100%. The beds are so comfortable great room service very clean. I definitely would return  "
December 2023,Awesome family Christmas stay at Brown’s ,Wonderful hotel with superb staff. A special thanks to Givi who was always around to help us out. The location in the heart of Mayfair is perfect for business or hitting all the fantastic nearby shops. 
December 2023,Exceeded our high expectations,"The hotel exceeded our high expectations in all respects. The staff could not have looked after us better, and when my wife was not well, were very attentive. Particular mention for front desk, doorman and room service. The style and ambience of the hotel is as good as you could hope for a 5 star traditional London hotel, and the room was a pleasure to  stay in. The bed was very, very comfortable.  Food and drink great, including some kindly provided FOC as they knew we were celebrating a big birthday. Have booked again for our next celebration!"
December 2023,Perfect in every way!,"Perfect in every way from check-in till the to check-out. The hotel is perfect situated and decorated with love for details. Amazing breakfast. The entire staff from the front office to the restaurant were super friendly, professional and always ready to help! I especially remember Charles & Mamadou at the front desk. I felt like at home!"
December 2023,Amazing Spa,"Spa was the most relaxing experience. We had the mother and daughter treatment, and my 8 year old daughter enjoyed it as much as I did. Aurora & Fouzia are amazing!!! They are like wizards. We made it out Christmas tradition and will be coming again!"
December 2023,Luxurious Get Away,What an absolutely charming hotel! Our room was gorgeous and comfortable. But what I loved most was that the concierge team reached out to us prior to our arrival and were very responsive in helping with arrangements before we arrived. Everyone we interacted with during our stay was so lovely and welcoming. And the cocktails at the Dononvan Bar are to die for! We would love to stay at Brown's again. 
November 2023,World Class Hotel,An incredibly beautiful historic hotel with luxury written all over it. Lovely suite with all the modern necessities. Absolutely fantastic service - from the moment the taxi pulled up outside - until the moment I left the Hotel. Staff were exemplary and so friendly and helpful. I will definitely come again.
December 2023,Welcome to your London home,"Took my family to London for Thanksgiving week and couldn't be happier with our stay at Brown's.  From the moment we arrived the staff worked to make us comfortable.  We arrived around 10am from NY and were tired and needed to change.  Our rooms were not ready, but they had a room where we could change and freshen up.   They recommended a quaint lunch place down the street and by the time we finished the rooms were ready.    The location was amazing.  Steps from Bond Street (great shopping) and a simple walk from all the parks, castles and other places you want to visit when you go to London.     The rooms were much larger than we expected from a European hotel.  Many of the hotels we have stayed in are tiny, but these were very comfortable.  We stayed in rooms 203 and 204.   203 has a sitting area and a huge closet and bathroom.  204 was slightly smaller but in no way was it small.  The in-room amenities are very good.   We received water each day as well as a welcome basket of fruit and chocolate truffles.  The bathroom was modern and spacious.  The beds were comfortable, and even though we were on the second-floor sleeping was not an issue.     The staff is an 11 out of 10.  They are the most professional and friendly people you can meet.  They truly care about you and want to make you feel like you are at home.  A perfect example of how they go out of their way to make you comfortable is on Thanksgiving they sent us pieces of pumpkin pie because they knew we weren't in the US celebrating.  At every turn they were there to help or just ask how everything was going.  We wanted to see a show but failed to get tickets before we arrived but that wasn't an issue.  They called around and gave us a list of potential shows and costs.  Once we decided on a show, they arranged everything.  Truely seamless.    The restaurants were great.  We ate breakfast at the hotel each morning and it was wonderful.  We also had a late dinner one night very close to their closing time, but we weren't rushed our treated poorly due to the late hour.  In fact, they said they were there for us and would stay as long as we wanted.    We also had afternoon tea, and this was a great meal.   Donovan's Bar was out of this world.  The drinks, atmosphere and staff are why this bar is considered one of the top 100 bars in the world.   If you want to feel at home in London, I highly recommend Brown's.

November 2023,World Class Hotel,An incredibly beautiful historic hotel with luxury written all over it. Lovely suite with all the modern necessities. Absolutely fantastic service - from the moment the taxi pulled up outside - until the moment I left the Hotel. Staff were exemplary and so friendly and helpful. I will definitely come again.
December 2023,Welcome to your London home,"Took my family to London for Thanksgiving week and couldn't be happier with our stay at Brown's.  From the moment we arrived the staff worked to make us comfortable.  We arrived around 10am from NY and were tired and needed to change.  Our rooms were not ready, but they had a room where we could change and freshen up.   They recommended a quaint lunch place down the street and by the time we finished the rooms were ready.    The location was amazing.  Steps from Bond Street (great shopping) and a simple walk from all the parks, castles and other places you want to visit when you go to London.     The rooms were much larger than we expected from a European hotel.  Many of the hotels we have stayed in are tiny, but these were very comfortable.  We stayed in rooms 203 and 204.   203 has a sitting area and a huge closet and bathroom.  204 was slightly smaller but in no way was it small.  The in-room amenities are very good.   We received water each day as well as a welcome basket of fruit and chocolate truffles.  The bathroom was modern and spacious.  The beds were comfortable, and even though we were on the second-floor sleeping was not an issue.     The staff is an 11 out of 10.  They are the most professional and friendly people you can meet.  They truly care about you and want to make you feel like you are at home.  A perfect example of how they go out of their way to make you comfortable is on Thanksgiving they sent us pieces of pumpkin pie because they knew we weren't in the US celebrating.  At every turn they were there to help or just ask how everything was going.  We wanted to see a show but failed to get tickets before we arrived but that wasn't an issue.  They called around and gave us a list of potential shows and costs.  Once we decided on a show, they arranged everything.  Truely seamless.    The restaurants were great.  We ate breakfast at the hotel each morning and it was wonderful.  We also had a late dinner one night very close to their closing time, but we weren't rushed our treated poorly due to the late hour.  In fact, they said they were there for us and would stay as long as we wanted.    We also had afternoon tea, and this was a great meal.   Donovan's Bar was out of this world.  The drinks, atmosphere and staff are why this bar is considered one of the top 100 bars in the world.   If you want to feel at home in London, I highly recommend Brown's.  We will never stay anywhere else.    …"
December 2023,"Brown's is a lovely, elegant hotel","A lovely elegant hotel: low-key, quiet, understated, well-located.  The staff is gracious and accomodating without being the slightest bit intrusive - they go above and beyond for their guests.  We felt pampered and cared for.  The room was clean and comfortable, with a lovely bathroom and amenities.  The price is to be expected for a major city hotel of this quality.  We will return."
December 2023,A home away from home,"Our recent stay at Browns just prior to Christmas was wonderful. We had lots of logistics to deal with having various family members arriving but staying elsewhere, Christmas shopping to do, restaurant plans that kept changing, all in the busy chaos of London at Christmas but the staff were always so helpful and welcoming. They truly seemed to care about us and went out of their way to help with everything. The breakfast was superb especially the French toast and the best coffee and tea we had in London. When we first arrived in our room we thought that it wasn’t anything special but it was comfortable - great bed, clean and had everything you need. It’s the service that makes Browns special. Would definitely return."

December 2023,Awesome family Christmas stay at Brown’s ,Wonderful hotel with superb staff. A special thanks to Givi who was always around to help us out. The location in the heart of Mayfair is perfect for business or hitting all the fantastic nearby shops. 
December 2023,Exceeded our high expectations,"The hotel exceeded our high expectations in all respects. The staff could not have looked after us better, and when my wife was not well, were very attentive. Particular mention for front desk, doorman and room service. The style and ambience of the hotel is as good as you could hope for a 5 star traditional London hotel, and the room was a pleasure to  stay in. The bed was very, very comfortable.  Food and drink great, including some kindly provided FOC as they knew we were celebrating a big birthday. Have booked again for our next celebration!"
December 2023,Perfect in every way!,"Perfect in every way from check-in till the to check-out. The hotel is perfect situated and decorated with love for details. Amazing breakfast. The entire staff from the front office to the restaurant were super friendly, professional and always ready to help! I especially remember Charles & Mamadou at the front desk. I felt like at home!"
December 2023,Amazing Spa,"Spa was the most relaxing experience. We had the mother and daughter treatment, and my 8 year old daughter enjoyed it as much as I did. Aurora & Fouzia are amazing!!! They are like wizards. We made it out Christmas tradition and will be coming again!"

December 2023,"Brown's is a lovely, elegant hotel","A lovely elegant hotel: low-key, quiet, understated, well-located.  The staff is gracious and accomodating without being the slightest bit intrusive - they go above and beyond for their guests.  We felt pampered and cared for.  The room was clean and comfortable, with a lovely bathroom and amenities.  The price is to be expected for a major city hotel of this quality.  We will return."
December 2023,A home away from home,"Our recent stay at Browns just prior to Christmas was wonderful. We had lots of logistics to deal with having various family members arriving but staying elsewhere, Christmas shopping to do, restaurant plans that kept changing, all in the busy chaos of London at Christmas but the staff were always so helpful and welcoming. They truly seemed to care about us and went out of their way to help with everything. The breakfast was superb especially the French toast and the best coffee and tea we had in London. When we first arrived in our room we thought that it wasn’t anything special but it was comfortable - great bed, clean and had everything you need. It’s the service that makes Browns special. Would definitely return."
December 2023,"Excellent, Hotel","Excellent Hotel, wonderful staff friendly breakfast was amazing service very friendly professional overall definitely 100%. The beds are so comfortable great room service very clean. I definitely would return  "
December 2023,Awesome family Christmas stay at Brown’s ,Wonderful hotel with superb staff. A special thanks to Givi who was always around to help us out. The location in the heart of Mayfair is perfect for business or hitting all the fantastic nearby shops. 
December 2023,Exceeded our high expectations,"The hotel exceeded our high expectations in all respects. The staff could not have looked after us better, and when my wife was not well, were very attentive. Particular mention for front desk, doorman and room service. The style and ambience of the hotel is as good as you could hope for a 5 star traditional London hotel, and the room was a pleasure to  stay in. The bed was very, very comfortable.  Food and drink great, including some kindly provided FOC as they knew we were celebrating a big birthday. Have booked again for our next celebration!"
December 2023,Perfect in every way!,"Perfect in every way from check-in till the to check-out. The hotel is perfect situated and decorated with love for details. Amazing breakfast. The entire staff from the front office to the restaurant were super friendly, professional and always ready to help! I especially remember Charles & Mamadou at the front desk. I felt like at home!"
December 2023,Amazing Spa,"Spa was the most relaxing experience. We had the mother and daughter treatment, and my 8 year old daughter enjoyed it as much as I did. Aurora & Fouzia are amazing!!! They are like wizards. We made it out Christmas tradition and will be coming again!"
December 2023,Luxurious Get Away,What an absolutely charming hotel! Our room was gorgeous and comfortable. But what I loved most was that the concierge team reached out to us prior to our arrival and were very responsive in helping with arrangements before we arrived. Everyone we interacted with during our stay was so lovely and welcoming. And the cocktails at the Dononvan Bar are to die for! We would love to stay at Brown's again. 
November 2023,World Class Hotel,An incredibly beautiful historic hotel with luxury written all over it. Lovely suite with all the modern necessities. Absolutely fantastic service - from the moment the taxi pulled up outside - until the moment I left the Hotel. Staff were exemplary and so friendly and helpful. I will definitely come again.
December 2023,Welcome to your London home,"Took my family to London for Thanksgiving week and couldn't be happier with our stay at Brown's.  From the moment we arrived the staff worked to make us comfortable.  We arrived around 10am from NY and were tired and needed to change.  Our rooms were not ready, but they had a room where we could change and freshen up.   They recommended a quaint lunch place down the street and by the time we finished the rooms were ready.    The location was amazing.  Steps from Bond Street (great shopping) and a simple walk from all the parks, castles and other places you want to visit when you go to London.     The rooms were much larger than we expected from a European hotel.  Many of the hotels we have stayed in are tiny, but these were very comfortable.  We stayed in rooms 203 and 204.   203 has a sitting area and a huge closet and bathroom.  204 was slightly smaller but in no way was it small.  The in-room amenities are very good.   We received water each day as well as a welcome basket of fruit and chocolate truffles.  The bathroom was modern and spacious.  The beds were comfortable, and even though we were on the second-floor sleeping was not an issue.     The staff is an 11 out of 10.  They are the most professional and friendly people you can meet.  They truly care about you and want to make you feel like you are at home.  A perfect example of how they go out of their way to make you comfortable is on Thanksgiving they sent us pieces of pumpkin pie because they knew we weren't in the US celebrating.  At every turn they were there to help or just ask how everything was going.  We wanted to see a show but failed to get tickets before we arrived but that wasn't an issue.  They called around and gave us a list of potential shows and costs.  Once we decided on a show, they arranged everything.  Truely seamless.    The restaurants were great.  We ate breakfast at the hotel each morning and it was wonderful.  We also had a late dinner one night very close to their closing time, but we weren't rushed our treated poorly due to the late hour.  In fact, they said they were there for us and would stay as long as we wanted.    We also had afternoon tea, and this was a great meal.   Donovan's Bar was out of this world.

But what I loved most was that the concierge team reached out to us prior to our arrival and were very responsive in helping with arrangements before we arrived. Everyone we interacted with during our stay was so lovely and welcoming. And the cocktails at the Dononvan Bar are to die for! We would love to stay at Brown's again. 
November 2023,World Class Hotel,An incredibly beautiful historic hotel with luxury written all over it. Lovely suite with all the modern necessities. Absolutely fantastic service - from the moment the taxi pulled up outside - until the moment I left the Hotel. Staff were exemplary and so friendly and helpful. I will definitely come again.
December 2023,Welcome to your London home,"Took my family to London for Thanksgiving week and couldn't be happier with our stay at Brown's.  From the moment we arrived the staff worked to make us comfortable.  We arrived around 10am from NY and were tired and needed to change.  Our rooms were not ready, but they had a room where we could change and freshen up.   They recommended a quaint lunch place down the street and by the time we finished the rooms were ready.    The location was amazing.  Steps from Bond Street (great shopping) and a simple walk from all the parks, castles and other places you want to visit when you go to London.     The rooms were much larger than we expected from a European hotel.  Many of the hotels we have stayed in are tiny, but these were very comfortable.  We stayed in rooms 203 and 204.   203 has a sitting area and a huge closet and bathroom.  204 was slightly smaller but in no way was it small.  The in-room amenities are very good.   We received water each day as well as a welcome basket of fruit and chocolate truffles.  The bathroom was modern and spacious.  The beds were comfortable, and even though we were on the second-floor sleeping was not an issue.     The staff is an 11 out of 10.  They are the most professional and friendly people you can meet.  They truly care about you and want to make you feel like you are at home.  A perfect example of how they go out of their way to make you comfortable is on Thanksgiving they sent us pieces of pumpkin pie because they knew we weren't in the US celebrating.  At every turn they were there to help or just ask how everything was going.  We wanted to see a show but failed to get tickets before we arrived but that wasn't an issue.  They called around and gave us a list of potential shows and costs.  Once we decided on a show, they arranged everything.  Truely seamless.    The restaurants were great.  We ate breakfast at the hotel each morning and it was wonderful.  We also had a late dinner one night very close to their closing time, but we weren't rushed our treated poorly due to the late hour.  In fact, they said they were there for us and would stay as long as we wanted.    We also had afternoon tea, and this was a great meal.   Donovan's Bar was out of this world.  The drinks, atmosphere and staff are why this bar is considered one of the top 100 bars in the world.   If you want to feel at home in London, I highly recommend Brown's.  We will never stay anywhere else.    …"
December 2023,"Brown's is a lovely, elegant hotel","A lovely elegant hotel: low-key, quiet, understated, well-located.  The staff is gracious and accomodating without being the slightest bit intrusive - they go above and beyond for their guests.  We felt pampered and cared for.  The room was clean and comfortable, with a lovely bathroom and amenities.  The price is to be expected for a major city hotel of this quality.  We will return."
December 2023,A home away from home,"Our recent stay at Browns just prior to Christmas was wonderful. We had lots of logistics to deal with having various family members arriving but staying elsewhere, Christmas shopping to do, restaurant plans that kept changing, all in the busy chaos of London at Christmas but the staff were always so helpful and welcoming. They truly seemed to care about us and went out of their way to help with everything. The breakfast was superb especially the French toast and the best coffee and tea we had in London. When we first arrived in our room we thought that it wasn’t anything special but it was comfortable - great bed, clean and had everything you need. It’s the service that makes Browns special. Would definitely return."

December 2023,Awesome family Christmas stay at Brown’s ,Wonderful hotel with superb staff. A special thanks to Givi who was always around to help us out. The location in the heart of Mayfair is perfect for business or hitting all the fantastic nearby shops. 
December 2023,Exceeded our high expectations,"The hotel exceeded our high expectations in all respects. The staff could not have looked after us better, and when my wife was not well, were very attentive. Particular mention for front desk, doorman and room service. The style and ambience of the hotel is as good as you could hope for a 5 star traditional London hotel, and the room was a pleasure to  stay in. The bed was very, very comfortable.  Food and drink great, including some kindly provided FOC as they knew we were celebrating a big birthday. Have booked again for our next celebration!"
December 2023,Perfect in every way!,"Perfect in every way from check-in till the to check-out. The hotel is perfect situated and decorated with love for details. Amazing breakfast.

December 2023,"Brown's is a lovely, elegant hotel","A lovely elegant hotel: low-key, quiet, understated, well-located.  The staff is gracious and accomodating without being the slightest bit intrusive - they go above and beyond for their guests.  We felt pampered and cared for.  The room was clean and comfortable, with a lovely bathroom and amenities.  The price is to be expected for a major city hotel of this quality.  We will return."
December 2023,A home away from home,"Our recent stay at Browns just prior to Christmas was wonderful. We had lots of logistics to deal with having various family members arriving but staying elsewhere, Christmas shopping to do, restaurant plans that kept changing, all in the busy chaos of London at Christmas but the staff were always so helpful and welcoming. They truly seemed to care about us and went out of their way to help with everything. The breakfast was superb especially the French toast and the best coffee and tea we had in London. When we first arrived in our room we thought that it wasn’t anything special but it was comfortable - great bed, clean and had everything you need. It’s the service that makes Browns special. Would definitely return."

December 2023,Exceeded our high expectations,"The hotel exceeded our high expectations in all respects. The staff could not have looked after us better, and when my wife was not well, were very attentive. Particular mention for front desk, doorman and room service. The style and ambience of the hotel is as good as you could hope for a 5 star traditional London hotel, and the room was a pleasure to  stay in. The bed was very, very comfortable.  Food and drink great, including some kindly provided FOC as they knew we were celebrating a big birthday. Have booked again for our next celebration!"
December 2023,Perfect in every way!,"Perfect in every way from check-in till the to check-out. The hotel is perfect situated and decorated with love for details. Amazing breakfast.

December 2023,Amazing Spa,"Spa was the most relaxing experience. We had the mother and daughter treatment, and my 8 year old daughter enjoyed it as much as I did. Aurora & Fouzia are amazing!!! They are like wizards. We made it out Christmas tradition and will be coming again!"
December 2023,Luxurious Get Away,What an absolutely charming hotel! Our room was gorgeous and comfortable. But what I loved most was that the concierge team reached out to us prior to our arrival and were very responsive in helping with arrangements before we arrived. Everyone we interacted with during our stay was so lovely and welcoming. And the cocktails at the Dononvan Bar are to die for! We would love to stay at Brown's again.

December 2023,Welcome to your London home,"Took my family to London for Thanksgiving week and couldn't be happier with our stay at Brown's.  From the moment we arrived the staff worked to make us comfortable.  We arrived around 10am from NY and were tired and needed to change.  Our rooms were not ready, but they had a room where we could change and freshen up.   They recommended a quaint lunch place down the street and by the time we finished the rooms were ready.    The location was amazing.  Steps from Bond Street (great shopping) and a simple walk from all the parks, castles and other places you want to visit when you go to London.     The rooms were much larger than we expected from a European hotel.  Many of the hotels we have stayed in are tiny, but these were very comfortable.  We stayed in rooms 203 and 204.   203 has a sitting area and a huge closet and bathroom.  204 was slightly smaller but in no way was it small.  The in-room amenities are very good.   We received water each day as well as a welcome basket of fruit and chocolate truffles.  The bathroom was modern and spacious.  The beds were comfortable, and even though we were on the second-floor sleeping was not an issue.     The staff is an 11 out of 10.  They are the most professional and friendly people you can meet.  They truly care about you and want to make you feel like you are at home.  A perfect example of how they go out of their way to make you comfortable is on Thanksgiving they sent us pieces of pumpkin pie because they knew we weren't in the US celebrating.  At every turn they were there to help or just ask how everything was going.  We wanted to see a show but failed to get tickets before we arrived but that wasn't an issue.  They called around and gave us a list of potential shows and costs.  Once we decided on a show, they arranged everything.  Truely seamless.    The restaurants were great.

June 2023,Great Stay in London ,"We stayed at the Hard in early June 2023 and we had a wonderful time.  The staff was so accommodating and helpful, the room was beautifully clean and comfortable, the restaurant delicious and the concierge so helpful when I realized I lost my phone.  The bar/bartenders and the little outside area off the bar was a delight and we spent late afternoons enjoying the fresh air and a glass of Rose!  The location couldn't be better - it's Knightsbridge and you can get pretty much anywhere quite easily from there.  We walked all over London and back to the Hari all 4 days.  I highly recommend this Hotel and will definitely stay there on my next visit.  Book the Hari, you will NOT be disappointed."
May 2023,Hari is Service ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,A very nice boutique hotel with excellent staff and services. Entire service team went out of their way to offer assistance when needed. I love this area of London and this specific location. They made traveling with my adult children as easy as possible. Highly recommend. 
June 2023,Wonderful boutique hotel in great location. ,"Wonderful boutique hotel in an excellent location in London, perfect for walking to other areas and sites. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We ate breakfast in the dining area one day and it was delicious. They readily accommodated early check in after an international flight and were there with coffee when we had to depart at 4:30AM. "
June 2023,An Outstanding Experience ,"As a regular visitor to London I had been recommended The Hari by friends and decided to stay here earlier this week. Firstly the location is outstanding. Situated in the heart of Belgravia this beautiful boutique hotel (only 85 rooms) offers a level of personal service and comfort that larger, chain hotels in a similar price bracket can rarely match. Particular recognition must go to Alex who was fantastic during the check-in process and had been made aware of my current mobility issues in advance. He was attentive, discrete and made an excellent impression throughout my stay. To Naomi, also, who looks after the bar in the restaurant and was highly professional and attentive. Thank you, both. My room was spacious, immaculately presented and afforded great views over the…"
June 2023,Perfect,"They made everything perfect, complementary flowers and a treat for my partners 30th birthday. Great rooms and nice location. Only problem was breakfast end time which the TV menu says is 12 but is actually 11."
June 2023,Dreamy!,Overall amazing experience and stay at The Hari hotel. The Penthouse is beautiful with incredible views of London. Haven't slept so peacefully in months and need to mention as well the incredible staff!

May 2023,The Hari Hotel is a great place to HQ your Holiday.,Great Hotel. Excellent location near Harrods and Knightsbridge. Staff is impeccable. Best Concierge staff in London. Nice rooms and a very comfortable lounge and bar area. We have stayed here multiple times and will be back.
May 2023,Always fantastic!,"Every stay seems to be better than the last. By far my favourite hotel in London. I love the location, just a short walk from some lovely restaurants. Although I am a big fan of the Italian restaurant in the hotel. Great cocktails there too! The room I stayed in has also been refurbished with a fresh new look.  The team are super friendly. I recommend to all my friends."
August 2023,Lovely!,"The staff is what makes the Hari so amazing.  They are all a pleasure to interact with, helpful, friendly and make every effort possible to ensure a great stay!  They are also a world-class hotel with a fantastic Italian restaurant and lovely bar/lounge area with plenty of seating and great service."
September 2023,Amazing stay! ,"Absolutely everything was perfect! The bedding is extremely comfortable, the rooms are clean and the design is nice. The service is as expected from a 5-star hotel.

August 2023,The Hari is perfection,"Every so often you find a hotel that is literally perfect. My recent stay at The Hari was amazing. The location, amenities, room offerings, expert housekeeping and nightly turndown service, and phenomenal staff made for an exquisite stay. I have finally found my ""regular hotel"" for all my trips to London. I can honestly say I am looking forward to my next stay at this amazing property."
September 2023,Great experience ,"Highly recommended. Great choice to stay in central London, food was great ,rooms very clean and staff make you feel like home. Alex is great asset to the Hari, anything we need he made sure was there on time. Plenty of shops and restaurants around the area. Definitely gonna go back. Thank you "
August 2023,Exceeding customer’s expectations,"The Hari is definitely in the top of hotels we stayed in worldwide. Not because of the great facilities but because of the unmatched service level. From the check-in to the last minutes we spent in the hotel, service was impeccable. Staff were extremely positive and helpful and always trying to exceed the customer’s expectations. Great example is that we casually mentioned at check-in that we would visit the New Forest after our London visit. When we came back from a long day in London we found a piece of chocolate art in our room (see the photo), which anticipated our next stop. Rooms are comfortable and really  well equipped (we got an upgrade and were offered a free minibar; room also has great beds and tv’s with chromecast) and we had a wonderful a la carte breakfast.…"
August 2023,Holiday,"Terrific multi national staff. Very friendly and accommodating Room was very comfortable and well maintained,  Extra requests were speedily dealt with  We enjoyed the restaurant for breakfast but wish it had been open for meals at other times.  Lovely visit"
August 2023,Great Experience!,"Loved my first visit to The Hari! As someone who used to live in London, I have stayed at many different hotels in the area when I come back to visit. The Hari was fantastic. It is the PERFECT location and would recommend. *Close to the Knightsbridge stop to go to/from Heathrow on the Tube, great location to take the Underground from Sloane Square stop to explore all of London).as well as all over London). Also lots of bus options nearby to get pretty much anywhere in Central London. *I had a nice and spacious room, with very good air conditioning, plenty of drawers and good size closet to hang clothes. The bathroom spacious and clean too. I loved the turn down service nightly. *Staff was great and were super helpful and friendly. *Great bar to relax and have a drink after a…"

August 2023,Best service in the world,"We faced a situation while staying there which we hope no one will ever have to go through it ever . Our young son passed away unexpectedly on the last night . We have never seen such a level of assistance and compassion anywhere else in the world . As a result of his passing we had to extend our stay for few days , the hotel manager informed us that our rooms will be free of charge for the coming 2 nights AND we when we had to extend again they gave us a 50% discount for the remainder of our stay . Big thanks to Andrew the General Manager , Mathew the Deputy GM and everyone else who were absolutely incredible . As difficult as it may be to return to the same hotel next time we are in London , as far as we are concerned there is one and only one hotel in London for our family .…"

At every turn they were there to help or just ask how everything was going.  We wanted to see a show but failed to get tickets before we arrived but that wasn't an issue.  They called around and gave us a list of potential shows and costs.  Once we decided on a show, they arranged everything.  Truely seamless.    The restaurants were great.  We ate breakfast at the hotel each morning and it was wonderful.  We also had a late dinner one night very close to their closing time, but we weren't rushed our treated poorly due to the late hour.  In fact, they said they were there for us and would stay as long as we wanted.    We also had afternoon tea, and this was a great meal.   Donovan's Bar was out of this world.  The drinks, atmosphere and staff are why this bar is considered one of the top 100 bars in the world.   If you want to feel at home in London, I highly recommend Brown's.

March 2023,Another excellent stay at the Hari Hotel.,"We’ve once again had the pleasure of staying at the Hari hotel and the standard of our suite and services was as usual second to no other.

Every member of staff were always on hand to make sure we had everything we needed and always acknowledged us with a beautiful smile and words of kindness. The food was to it’s usual very high standards and was served with speed and a smile. Our evenings spent whiling away the hours in the very comfortable bar area drinking cocktails and picking at the never ending supply of nibbles brought to our table was very relaxing. Whenever we are in London…"

The visit to the bar on the first floor was a perfect night in. Alessio, Naomi and Caris were spot on with their cocktail recommendations (Casa Azul was my favorite!)  and were very attentive."
December 2022,The best service in town,"Great room, great views, great location, wonderful range of amenities and the greatest service possible. Every single team member really cared and wanted to help with anything. This is the best, and certainly the perfect location for exploring the local attractions."
January 2023,Christmas Lunch ❤️,"The hari hotel… What a place !! Absolutely loved it..  We joined the hari on Christmas lunch with a group of 8 people and the moment we walked in we felt like home, everyone’s was so nice and friendly starting from the security guys at the front door.  You can smell that amazing elegant and refined perfumes which they use ! (Which I personally loved it)  We had lunch at the Pampero restaurant, but before that the Manager Vittorio bought us upstairs to a little tour at the terrace. ( I assumed he was the manager because of the way he was talking to us and the suit)   The hotel has such an amazing design and decoration! (So classy)  The lunch it was outstanding, the food it was 10/10 and the service it was brilliant!!   Vittorio is definitely a star, he went above and beyond our…"
December 2022,New Years 2023,"Everyone is so welcoming, rooms nice and location great!  Even when i dropped an earring and it shot under the cabinet - they cam equipped and found it!  This was my second stay.   I highly recommend The Hari.  Ps -special shout out to Ricardo and Sam!  "
December 2022,Home from Home,"I can’t rave enough about the staff at the Hari.   Florin was the ultimate gem. Greeted us at breakfast at 7am then made us drinks in the bar. He was truly lovely.  I hope he and his wife and baby are happy and healthy.  The girl who was guarding the tables at the library bar was doing a great jo.b with pure difficult clients.   I had a passport issue and the staff were so fantastic. It really made it so much easier for me. Getting up at 7 on new year’s day and being offered an espresso while waiting for your car is beyond.  Beautiful neighborhood, beautiful room, exceptional people. I will always remember them fondly."
January 2023,Beautiful hotel in the heart of the city,"Love the Hari, its a cozy home from home while traveling. The staff couldn’t be more helpful and accommodating. The location is excellent, right in the heart of the city. I will definitely be booking to stay again!  "
January 2023,Over expectations!,"The hotel is located in the best neighborhood of London; it is very close to where you want to be and far enough from chaos, noise, etc. The atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming, bar is great, the staff very kind and helpful. In addition the reception staff took care to prepare for us of a totally unexpected surprise; by far this was over any expectation! Well done, we'll be back again when visiting London."
September 2022,Beautiful Property in London,"We recently stayed at the Hari for a short stay, our room was on the 8th floor and we had amazing views of the City including St Pauls Cathedral. the room was immaculate and extremely well maintained with helpful and friendly staff. The complementary champagne in our room was greatly received!!  We would stay again and will recommend.. Thank you to all staff at the Hari"
October 2022,Great vibes and best drinks,"I went to the Hari hotel with my brother and his friends for a few drinks and I was left speechless the very moment I walked in. For starters, the interior design of the hotel is stylish and modern yet creates a very cozy and intimate atmosphere, not to mention the drinks,  absolutely exquisite! To be honest, I'm not very fond of cocktails, or alcohol in general, but the Casa Azul I had was not only aesthetically and visually pleasing, but it was also tasted so amazing that I literally could have got addicted to it in no time!! I'd like to thank the entire bar staff, with their kindness, knowledge and professionalism they made the experience even better"
August 2022,Love The Hari,"My husband and I stayed there during the London marathon and it was our first time and it definitely will not be our last . The service was exceptional. The entire team , from the lovely friendly door men to the housekeeping were just super professional and exceptional. The location is also perfect . Thank you so much to the entire team. The GLAS family"
September 2022,It just keeps getting better,"The service at The Hari is simply incredible. They make you feel at home from the minute you step in , especially Bruno , so welcoming and extremely hospitable.  The rooms are very clean , modern , extremely comfortable bed and nice big windows.   The drinks at the bar and ambience there is amazing.  The hotel is located in such a lovely quiet neighbourhood and walking distance to Knightsbridge , Harrods and Hyde Park.  I am a frequent traveller to London and I will always return to The Hari and would definitely recommend this nice, cozy boutique hotel."
August 2022,The Hari is your choice if you are looking for outstanding accommodation,It above and beyond expectations as customer service. The location is close to everything. The room is very clean and neat. The furniture is new. Staff is so friendly. One of their competitive advantages is that mini bar is complementary
September 2022,My favourite staycation in London,Very enjoyable stay at the lovely Hari hotel. Every stay is a delight of comfort and attention from staff that come out of their way to make you feel welcome and at home. Definitely my favourite staycation in London
September 2022,The Hari Exceeds Expectation,"Thank you to the entire Hari staff for making my stay comfortable and wonderful.  A special shout out to Bruno and Sammy. Both of whom went above and beyond, especially taking care of my travel companion while she was under the weather. "
August 2022,6 stars!,"5!  I had a very pleasant evening at The Hari Hotel and feel compelled to write. The evening began with the  supervisor Giuseppe, meeting me cordially and very warmly.   When I asked some questions, he answered like an old friend, creating in me the feeling that I seeing an old friend again, the feeling that I somehow returned home.  I’ve always loved Italy and the warmth of the Italian people and today Giuseppe reconfirmed this.  We talked about different topics with ease and overall, I had an absolutely great evening.  I wanted to add a few words about the barman, Mikhail Who was very impressive. Like a true professional, he guessed my taste inclinations and offered me a cocktail on gin with currant liqueur, a personal favorite but he seemed to have added a secret ingredient…"
September 2022,"The Hari is a ""must stay"" when in London","The Hari is a ""must stay"" when in London. Very comfortable, the staff are amazing, as there was nothing that was too much trouble. Such great service and of course a great location. A wonderful place to stay."
August 2022,Amazing Stay at The Hari!,The Hari was simply wonderful from start to finish. We were enthuiastically greeted by a fantastic front desk staff which was the beginning of an amazing stay here. The rooms are modern yet not overdone. The hotel itself just has a charm that is hard to replicate. The bar area and terrace were very cute too. The concierge was super helpful throughout our trip providing great recos and helping to get us to the airport when we were running very far behind. I loved that this boutique hotel felt intitmate in the best way possible. It is also perfectly situated with access to the touristy attractions including museums as well as for luxury shopping. I would highly recommend + also stay here again.
November 2022,Amazing luxury hotel experience in a beautiful neighborhood,"Great location. Neighborhood of Belgravia is home to lots of beautiful buildings (mostly embassies so it's fairly quiet after hours and on weekends). Walking distance from Hyde Park and Green Park. 10-15 min uber to the many areas nearby with lots of bars and restaurants, but if you want to be near to the main busy areas but still far enough away to not be overwhelmed, this is it. Staff was extremely helpful.  Hotel was actually on the small end and had a boutique vibe, while also having all the services and amenities of a larger hotel. Outstanding experience overall and would definitely stay here again on the next London trip."
October 2022,The Hari..you are Exceptional!,"Back again and this was another perfect stay. The service, and the hospitality of this place just gets better and better. Such a cozy and lovely boutique hotel. This is the place to stay in in London. Perfect location. We can walk to Harrods, Hyde Park and the lively Knightsbridge area which is around the corner. The bed is super comfy and Bruno at the front desk is so nice and so helpful . The entire staff is extremely helpful and make you feel at home."
July 2022,Perfection,"What a gem, everything about our experience was special from the start to the end the super slick service, stylish on trend interior.  Best nights sleep and  bathrooms to die for.  Immaculate rooms and impeccable  service, attention to  detail.   Will not stay anywhere else in London ever again, certainly a 5 star experience, luxurious. "
October 2022,Hari London,"Unique hotel with unique rooms overlooking a garden.  Separate window box sitting areas and/or tubs very nice.  Rooms not large but well finished.  Very good restaurant for breakfast, nice bar for pre night cocktail or late night cap.  Location excellent walked to most everything.  Had a challenge with AC a few hot days in June but got through it.  Expensive but for London, location and quality, a repeat for us."
October 2022,"Plush, understated and personal","I was drawn to this property for its location (near where I wanted to be in the city) and its smaller size. I wanted a quiet hotel in a serene part of town and that's exactly what The Hari delivers. The service I experienced was very good which started with my room being ready early. My travel plans changed while I was there and they also helped me extend my stay one night and remain in the same room.  I love the understated elegance of the hotel. It's posh but cozy. With only 80-some rooms it never felt crowded anywhere including the two elevators. In fact, I only rode the elevator with another person once. I dined in the restaurant several times during my stay (breakfast and dinner) and thought the food and atmosphere was lovely. I also enjoyed a drink in the bar (with their…"
October 2022,A great stay at the Hari London,"We had a super wedding anniversary celebration at the Hari. Nice spacious quiet room. Helpful staff throughout. Good restaurant and excellent Belgravia location, close to Piccadilly, Knightsbridge, Sloane Square and Victoria."
October 2022,Lovely welcome and stay,"My friends and I with their two small children had a lovely stay and lunch at the Hari , the team made us feel welcome and at ease and were so nice to accommodate us with a large table and a dedicated service. Alex and Vittorio took excellent care of us all. The children and us loved the food and will definitely be back again."
September 2022,Great place to stay in Belgravia,"Great location, great staff, nice and clean  rooms and bathrooms and impeccable service. The personnel is helpful and efficient.  I love the Hari and would highly recommend it. The bar is also a nice hang out with amazing drinks and the Italian restaurant is so good!"
October 2022,So very grateful,"My experience at this wonderful hotel is fairly unique.  For me, unfortunately, my first time ever to London I was quite sick.  The hotel was comfortable, clean, well appointed, cozy, classy and the staff was first rate. They were all exceptionally kind and encouraging of my situation and in particular Bruno....we was very supportive and went out of his way to be helpful.  Someday I hope to have a 'do-over' in London and return to this special hotel....and hopefully see less of my room and more of London!  "
October 2022,The ripple effect of contentment,"This is by far one of the best five-star stay experiences I have ever journeyed. A customised guest experience that’s as unique as to its art collection displays and parallel to their staff members’ characters. Catered to us with gourmet Italian brunch to hand written welcome notes and souvenirs.   The impressive experience was made obvious for us to  extend our welcome to host our friend for a drink, to do a must-try their very special curated list of cocktails. The Hari experience has the ripple effect to pass on smiles.  A special thanks to Arianna, Mattia, Sante, Maria and all the F&B staffs."
April 2022,This is the place to stay in London,This is our fourth stay at The Hari. It has been wonderful. Rooms lovely. Service excellent. Front of house engaging and warm. Breakfast ( cooked by Federico  S) just sublime. Just a great place to be to escape the rush of London. Location perfect. Central but quiet.
March 2022,Bar and Terrace,"Had wonderful time in this lovely place, the atmosphere is cozy and private had a magic memory of the supervisor Naomi suggesting us what to drink from their signatures cocktails,  For sure we will come back asap"
April 2022,incredibile experience,I had such a fabulous stay in this place becoming my new favorite place for cocktails and food in central London . They welcoming us since the beginning and the cocktail list is fabulous. Many thanks to Naomi to make our cocktails with such an attention to the details and to Kyanu for making our evening special and unforgettable we will come back for sure!
April 2022,Great little boutique hotel,"Liked everything about this hotel but most of all the lovely friendly staff. The hotel has a warmth and distinctiveness that you just don’t get chain hotels.  Room we had was very comfortable, tastefully decorated and in excellent condition.  Breakfast is a  la cart and of a high quality.  It’s in a quiet area with no noticeable street noise.  Despite it being in a quiet area it’s a good base with easy access to all parts of the city. A couple of tube stations less than 10 minutes walk.  A big thumbs up!"
April 2022,Visit to our friendly Hari Hotel,Friendly staff - our home from home in London - bar area exceptional and location great - can walk to everything - if you don’t know about this hotel you should check it out - chef in restaurant produces amazing Italian dishes 
April 2022,"Best place to have a rest after intense day of work , recommend for solo visits , nice bartenders Victor and Giusepe","It was a lovely time what I spent here. Special thank for Victor the bartender and waiter Sergio, who are good company. I can’t wait to go back with my friends and family, to have the same wonderful experience. Also big plus for smoking cigars in the terrace. The all team were super friendly and adorable. Many thanks!"
April 2022,Amazing Hotel!!,"Amazing experience. My husband has cancer and this was a big trip for him. He mentioned that he really liked the art behind the desk because he has flown jets and Bruno and Maria bought a frame and sent a photo of the jet with a lovely card and chocolate to him. Our concierge, Ricardo was also amazing. Everyone was so friendly and went out of our way to make us comfortable. "
April 2022,Made Our Trip,"Maria and the team went above and beyond when we stayed with them. They really did make it a trip to remember. It was my partners birthday and they helped me with the surprises for my partner. I really couldn't have asked for it to go better. Nothing was an issue, and the bed gave me one of the best night sleeps I've had in a long time. I wish I could have taken it home!"
April 2022,The Perfect London Location,"from a warm, welcoming reception to the most delicious food during the stay, I would recommend the Hari for those who might be unsure of where to find the best of the best in London. The hotel and staff are not pretentious in the slightest but the whole experience still feels very exclusive and special. You can walk to all the finest places and the retreat to the most comfortable and quiet room for a great night sleep. Looking forward to next time!"
April 2022,Unforgettable Experience,"I’ve  been with some friends to this unbelievable place, we were welcoming from the beginning from the doorman (I think his name was Chris). We had a reservation for the restaurant but we decided to go for a drink to the bar first, where Naomi gave us a very warm welcome. She patiently describes the stunning art cocktail list, i tried the cocktails dedicated to Banksy.  Then we went to the restaurant where Giuseppe and Sandra make us feel at home. The octopus was the best thing of my life!  We will definitely come back, and maybe try to have a night in this wonderful place, thank you all!"
May 2022,Brilliant service,"Would highly recommend the minute you walk in you feel very welcome, the staff are so friendly and polite. We had drinks in the beautiful terrace. The hotel was very clean and I loved the decor! Can’t wait to visit again."
May 2022,Exceptional weekend stay at the Hari,"I stayed at the Hari over the weekend, and had a fantastic experience throughout! We were welcomed by Diego and Claudio who were incredibly friendly and helpful, and we were offered a nice welcome drink at the bar (amazingly made cocktails, lovely stylish setting). Our room itself was nice and spacious, with a beautiful bathroom which had a big bathtub (my bath in there felt like a spa experience). The brunch the next day was lovely too, and the service was friendly and attentive. The decor in the restaurant is beautiful and elegant too, as it is throughout the hotel to be honest.  Everything was brilliant. Thank you to everyone at the hotel who made my stay so enjoyable!"
May 2022,Amazing stay at a beautiful hotel in the heart of chelsea!,"We stayed at the Hari this past weekend and everything was 10/10 from start to finish. Matthew greeted us upon arrival and was friendly, welcoming and offered great recommendations for restaurants in the area. The lounge and restaurant are amazing as well as the phenomenal service from the front desk team. We felt taken care of and the staff really do care about our stay. Will 100% be returning!!"
May 2022,Amazing service!,"I fell in love with this hotel! Went for a weekend getaway to London with friends and enjoyed the warm service. Location of the hotel is perfect! We were made to feel at home immediately! I usually don't like to spend too much time in a hotel when traveling, but the atmosphere and team were so refreshing and professional, we felt very comfortable. We even decided to have the weekend bottomless brunch which was delicious! What a treat! Special thanks to the excellent service from Alex and Ariana throughout the stay! We will be back!"
May 2022,Brunch at The Hari,"I got to enjoy a beautiful brunch in The Hari; the food was amazing and the service exquisite. The setting was nice and we got to enjoy some live music! Alex seem to have everything under control perfectly and Ariana catered to our every need. I want to take this opportunity to thank the staff from The Hari, I will definitely recommend and come back"
April 2022,Look no further for first class,"My wife and I recently spent a week in London staying at The Hari. The words that immediately come to mind are professional, helpful, friendly and personal. Notwithstanding these impressive behaviours by every member of the team, the quality of our room was first class and we were graciously upgraded to a larger room on arrival given our 7 night stay. The location is second to none and London is easily accessible by foot, the underground or taxi. We have no doubt that the experience is a reflection of a positive culture lead by senior concierge Ben Malpass. Exceptional!"
May 2022,Family weekend,"My daughter and I came to The Hari for a pre-exam relaxing weekend. This isn’t our first visit and, again, we were hugely impressed. The staff are amazing, so welcoming and attentive - always looking to see how they can make your stay perfect. The room was gorgeous with a beautiful view over the park and stocked with everything you’d need. Thank you for such a wonderful stay, we’re looking forward to seeing you all again !!"
April 2022,Cannot wait to return,A completely faultless stay. A very friendly and welcoming greeting by members of reception and concierge. The bar had a lovely ambience. Very comfortable and spacious room which was tastefully decorated. Unfortunately we didn’t eat at the hotel but the restaurant looked very inviting and will definitely make a reservation the next time we visit. Hard pushed to find a nicer location in London. The service from all staff was exceptional. 5 stars from us.
April 2022,Hidden gem with incredible service,"My stay at The Hari was just wonderful. I was charmed by the team, they are all extremely attentive to our needs. I slept like a baby, the bed is so comfy, and the design is superb. This hotel has a great soul, I highly recommend it while staying in London."
April 2022,An intimate city escape ,"Coming back to The Hari feels like coming back home - not just the familiarity but the warmth of the hospitality and service. The King Premium rooms are spacious by London standards, the Bar and The Italian restaurant have an easy intimacy, superbly helmed by Juan and Giuseppe respectively. The hotel is populated with exciting contemporary art and the decor suggests warmth and brilliant design. The neighbourhood now has amazing shops and cafes and bars that add to the whole experience.  Overall - a property that becomes a residence whenever one is in London. "
June 2022,Nice but ...?,So reading the waxing lyrical reviews of this hotel we expected something more.   Don’t get me wrong it is a decent place with very nice staff but to be the number four (at time of writing) London hotel on TA is frankly absurd.   We spent three nights in a Hari Suite.  One reason we took this suite was because of the fireplace which we love while in the UK.  More later … Welcome is fine.  Décor and entrance are nice but underwhelming by 5 star London standards. Lifts are small.   We had booked a table on the ‘beautiful’ terrace for dinner.  You could not make up how unlovely this small room is.  As it was populated by a family with kids and the size of my living room it was not conducive to a peaceful evening.  We assumed it was a holding area or bar but no – this was the…
May 2022,"Adequate hotel in good location, but very overpriced","Adequate, but way overpriced (> £1000/night for an adequate, but tiny, room where the previous guest's hair still clung to the shower door - and breakfast wasn't even included !).   Breakfast is very slow (10 minutes just to get your coffee and then the waitress gets your breakfast order wrong, so you have to wait some more). Unfortunately no buffet."
May 2022,Belgravia hotel,"Wonderful accommodation in a quiet neighborhood. Great, friendly staff.  Convenient to several tube lines and just a couple of blocks to Buckingham Palace. Hard to forget the Cacio  E Pepe in the restaurant, il Pamparo."
May 2022,Going back home ,I’ve stayed here a few times now. It honestly feels like going back home. I love it! Everything is just fantastic and I would not stay anywhere else in London. The staff are exceptional. The most comfortable beds. The cocktails are amazing- the list is endless 
May 2022,A great find ,"This hotel is in a great location, staff were very attentive and helpful, room was great, facilities excellent and incredibly clean.  NCP parking just round the corner with great overnight deals.  We will be back."
May 2022,Outstanding in every way!,"The Hari is exceptional in every way! From the comfort of the room, to the outstanding food at Il Pampero, to the atmosphere at the bar! The very best thing about The Hari is the staff from the General Manager Andrew, Head Concierge Ben & his people and to include each & every member of the service staff! "
May 2022,Love is in the air at The Hari Hotel!,"I booked the Hari Hotel due to its modern feel and excellent central location. The hotel is a short walk away from Hyde Park, Sloane Street, and excellent restaurants such as Marcus at The Berkeley and Petrus by Gordon Ramsey.   This was a particularly important stay as It was my girlfriends 30th birthday and I would be making a surprise proposal in Hyde Park during our stay, which I made the hotel aware of in advance!   The customer service was absolutely impeccable throughout our stay. In particular, Marzia, Guest Relations Manager, really went the extra mile to make our  stay one that we will cherish and look back on ever so fondly. Upon arrival Marzia and the team arranged an early check-in for us, a beautiful room looking over London containing flowers, Champagne, birthday…"
May 2022,The Hari gets a 10/10!,"Such a lovely and cozy boutique hotel . You will fall in love with this property the minute you walk in. Staff are super friendly and the service is impeccable. Claudio at the front desk was really helpful, always smiling and cheerful.   The location is perfect. Walking distance to Harrod’s ,Hyde Park and the shops in Knightsbridge.  Nice rooms , decent size and the bed is extremely comfortable.  Would highly recommend The Hair and would definitely visit again."
May 2022,Best Sleep,"I could mention the great room, the central and safe location, how pleasant everybody was, but something my wife said made me realize what is the most important: we slept like babies during our 3 nights at the Hari. Is it the comfortable bed, the quietness (even though our room was on the street side), or something else? I don't know, and I don't really care. A good night sleep is what hotels are there to provide, and the Hari does that, and more. I highly recommend it."
May 2022,Great staff and location,This hotel is excellently located in Belgravia close to central London about 20 minutes walking quickly. Our room was compact but very high quality appointments.   Staff could not have been more welcoming and attentive pleasant they all get full marks.   We highly recommend this hotel.
March 2022,Perfect location and great friendly staff,"The reason why I gave a 4/5 is the bar. The cocktails are way to small for the amount of money they ask... pitty!  The hotel stay was perfect, good bed, nice mini bar for free and yes wqlking distance to all the good spots! I will definitely come bqck here.."
August 2022,Wonderful stay all thanks to a wonderful staff!,"I stayed at The Hari back in March, the staff and facilities were awesome! All of the staff members were thoughtful and made an effort to ensure my mother and I were well taken care of throughout our stay. All of the food was delicious, I miss the room service breakfast! The hotel was quiet and very well located, within easy walking to distance to Harrod's, Belgrave Square and many other sights. I highly recommend staying here and would stay here again when I make it back to London"
August 2022,A hidden Gem of a restaurant,The three of us were warmly welcomed in a very elegant and atmospheric restaurant. We were taken to our seat in a booth where we could see the sky above us and the staff was so alert and very pleasant. We were served by Vittorio who seemed to have an extensive knowledge of the menu and wine selections and he was simply delightful. The food was delicious! Each dish were beautifully presented and full of exciting flavours. The menu wasn’t overwhelming so we enjoyed being able to pick many dish so we could share. We will definitely go back just to try the rest of the menu as it was truly delicious. Overall we had a wonderful experience and highly recommend this Italian restaurant in this elegant and friendly hotel in Mayfair.
August 2022,Absolutely fabulous,"Excellent in every way. . Wonderful staff, superb room, first class food and service. Nothing is too much trouble. Our second visit and will definitely stay again. Lovely part of the city. Beautiful restaurant"
August 2022,Exceptional Boutique Hotel,"My husband and I took our daughter to The Hari for 3 nights her 6th Birthday and wow what an experience! Beautiful hotel, fabulous staff and so friendly. The attention my daughter received from the staff especially the fabulous Maria and the Guest Services Team was faultless. They made her and our stay out of this world. Rooms are lovely and spacious with superb amenities. The staff all treated our daughter like a princess and nothing was too much trouble. They all went above and beyond to ensure she had a fabulous day. My husband and I were also exceptionally well received. The breakfast is delicious and so much choice!! The Restaurant Il Pampero was exceptional. The whole stay was perfect and we will definitely be returning. One word FABULOUS"
July 2022,Elite Hotel,"Great experience that solidified my future return to this beautiful city of London! Establishments of this caliber (5 star) tend to have an element of pretension. Not at the Hari! Pure class, genuine smiles and professionalism by everyone you encounter. It is an wonderful experience throughout and the service is truly the heart of the hotel. I look forward to returning in the future!"
June 2022,My favourite hotel in London,Had a fantastic stay again at The Hari. Love the team and atmosphere. Have booked my next stay for Christmas already. Can’t imagine staying anywhere else in London now. They make you feel so special.  See you soon!
July 2022,Wimbledon trip,"The stay for this trip was generally very good. I was impressed by the attention given by the staff of the hotel with one minor exception. The food experience was not what I had hoped for as, despite a very sparse breakfast clientele, it took a great deal of work to get the attention of the staff in the main restaurant to get attended to with service requests and the bill. Despite this I would return to the Hari as it had a character that I enjoyed."
June 2022,"Best place to stay in Belgravia, Knightsbridge, Chelsea, Kensington","Our third visit now. This place has a fantastic location. Friendly and willing staff throughout. Clean rooms and bathrooms. Great bar food, drinks and cocktails. Infinitely better value than the Carlton Towers."
June 2022,Always terrific ,"Always terrific, the team at The Hari are excellent at making guests feel at home and welcome. Super location, great service, lovely rooms. The restaurant, Il Pampero, is worthy of a special mention as weel"
March 2022,A lovely place to stay in London!,"Clean, accommodating, friendly, excellent service. The food was delicious, the drinks exemplary and the staff highly professional. We were there for Wimbledon- highly recommend this hotel. Shopping and Buckingham Palace just a short walk away. "
February 2022,A wonderful experience.,"Our second visit to The Hari did not disappoint.  An amazing and helpful staff work at this hotel.  Everyone is friendly, and welcoming.  The rooms are large (for London) and very well appointed.  Housekeeping (daily) is well done.  The food and beverage options in the bar and restaurant are very good.  Nothing about The Hari disappoints.  The location in Belgravia is excellent for those that like to walk and see the sights.  The hotel is also very close to several London Tube stations."
March 2022,Amazing to be back,"Another more than great visit at The Hari! I must say I do feel at home there. The staff is super well trained and friendly. The food and accommodation are of great quality! The value for money is amazing even more as it is in Belgravia, one of the most exclusive district in the world. It feels so special! Also had the pleasure to meet Andrew again, the general manager who runs this place very well. I am becoming a true ambassador as it is so rare to find such authentic hotel!"
December 2021,Visit from Pittsburgh PA for son's bachelor weekend and football match,"I stayed at the hotel years ago under different name, and while great then, it far exceeded this time round.  We were visiting for my sons bachelor weekend and to explore and see a football match from Mar 10-14.  From day of arrival reception from front desk staff (didnt get name but 10 am hour on March 10) Diego and doorman, all made us feel very welcome and took care to assist with storing bags till room ready.  The rooms and service were excellent each day, clean and refreshed.  We ate breakfast several days and received excellent service in restaurant.  The highlight of our stay though has to be the treatment and service we received in the upstairs bar area each night when returning from our day out.  From night 1 meeting Marta and her setting the tone of excellent service,…"
March 2022,Disappointing,"This hotel (I think) was an ex-Sheraton and it is not up to normal London standards. The bar is cramped and the service is really slow and over priced. The terrace is more like a tiny yard, so don't be fooled by the wide angle photo. The rooms are pretty small as is the shower room. For the prices charged we have stayed in much better London Hotels. Everything was just OK and that is being kind. Oh, except the staff who are lovely"
March 2022,Incredible stay!!,"This stay has been incredible. Nothing to fault. All staff have been amazing. So friendly and helpful. But have to highlight in particular how incredible Maria has been. She went above and beyond to make my partners trip so special and I’m so grateful. She organised cake, balloons, drinks, chocolates. She’s amazing! We have thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Thank you to you all! We would definitely stay here again and bring our pup next time! Fab location too."
March 2022,Little Gem,"My friend and I visited the Hari for brunch in the Italian restaurant and enjoyed it so much we stayed in the hotel for more drinks.  This is a real gem of a place with very attentive staff especially Kyanu who was a delightful waiter, nothing was too much.  We will definitely be back I can't recommend this beautiful hotel enough."
March 2022,Great little hotel!,My friend and I attended the Hari for dinner recently and all I can say is what a gem! The minute we walked in we felt welcome. All the staff were friendly and happy to help.  The cocktails were superb and the food delicious. The service was quick and efficient.  I love the decor. Especially the current Beatles pictures on display. A must for any fan.  The Manager Alex was so warm and helpful when we asked for recommendations of local places and knowledgeable in his directions.  It’s the loveliest place I’ve been in a while. Will definitely be back.
March 2022,Amazing experience,"I came on  the 4th with a friend of mine to the hari and was the first time for us, we had a reservation to the restaurant but we went first to have a cocktail in the bar where peppe welcoming us and suggest two of the art cocktail list and they were amazing!! Than we went to the restaurant il pampero and Naomi and Sandra were looking after us suggesting food and wine  .All the staff was so welcoming and so knowledgeable we will come back for sure !!"
March 2022,CAN'T WAIT TO RETURN,"My wife and I were fortunate to spend a night at The Hari last week. What a brilliant place to stay in London.  The welcome at reception was so very friendly, the room was very good, the evening meal and breakfast were superb and the service throughout the hotel was brilliant. Thanks to all the great staff at The Hari."
April 2022,Great luxury customer journey through out,"Visited the Hari at their bar&lounge on a Monday evening. Definitely the best Monday blue remedy. The warm ambience can only be described as parallel to Hari's service. The manager, Sante, was a delightful character. He had the right balance of friendliness and efficiency and was personable, so were the other staff members, they made sure that we had everything we needed. The entire customer journey was just perfect; from the moment you enter the door to the moment you leave and be left with a warm-hearted smile. I can't think of a better way to end our night."
April 2022,Susan Rushton,Was made welcomed and service was quick and presented very professionally and polite  Staff were friendly would definitely go back and hotel was clean and spotless  Very easy to get to hotel from tube station
April 2022,Unreal service,We have just left after a one night stay and after trawling option after option we settled on the Hari from a location point of view.   Having booked on the way down I sent the usual cheeky request as it was my partners birthday and didn’t really expect anything of it.   What we received was the warmest welcome to a hotel I have ever encountered from Bruno and Tony on reception along with a complimentary room upgrade and welcome drink.   I would also like to complement the door men and especially the gent on our exit (the one who doesn’t like truffle :)   Having returned to the room after dinner we were then greeted by a bottle of bubbly and a dessert in the room along with the most thoughtful birthday card.   Barring the fact this place has the best bed in a hotel I have slept…
March 2022,Perfect Brunch,"My friend and I had a wonderful time at The Hari for their weekend brunch.  Staff were kind and helpful and couldn’t do enough for you. The drinks and food were superb. The hotel is beautiful and modern. Would highly recommend a visit and if you get the opportunity, stop for a drink on the beautiful terrace.  Special thanks goes to the food and beverage staff who were wonderful and to Sante - a simply perfect host.  We are planning a return visit already - thank you."
April 2022,Anniversary trip,"Great location in a quiet area. Brilliant welcome from all staff. Has an intimate feel even though it has many rooms. Rooms were well equipped and bed very comfortable. We have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and we will be back. Staff selection, training and leadership seem to work well here."
March 2022,Comfortable and Stylish,Spent a night when heading to a wedding - had a great stay - nice modern room with a great bed and stylish bathroom.   The bar was good too  We had breakfast in our room via room service and it was a good decision.   Would recommend and would stay again.
March 2022,Lovely Boutique Hotel,"Spent 4 nights on holiday. Location is  very  central that is hard to beat, being close to all the shopping, museums, and restaurants we needed.   Very helpful staff with  very quick check-in/out.  Modern but warm and cozy interior, tastefully done.  clean rooms.  Will be back."
March 2022,The hotel has friendly staff !,"We stayed there for the first time, claudio made sure it was the best stay , definitely coming back for the next time , make sure to book the studio suite its the Best! Friendly staff , lovely accommodation ."
March 2022,Superb stay!,"What a hotel! The decor, the comfort, the staff, the quality, everything was spot on. And it's a great location - Knightsbridge and Sloane Square tube stations are both walking distance. I can't wait to come back and stay again!"
March 2022,So good to be back!,"It’s been a few years since I have stayed here and I’m delighted to say it’s even better than I remembered. We were celebrating this weekend and were made to feel so special by the team. It was also lovely to see some familiar faces from our last visit. We didn’t have time for brunch this weekend, but the musician sounded great so will definitely be booking that on our next visit."
February 2022,Amazing hotel especially Claudio,"Myself and my husband checked in, to be greeted with a welcome drink any of our choice, and a room upgrade. Claudio the new manager checked us in and went over and beyond to make our stay special. The service provided was exceptional from himself and all other staff member. Beds where comfortable, location was amazing and the room was spacious and a nice temperature. Will definitely recommend and will definitely visit again."
January 2022,First Visit But Not Our Last!,"We stayed at The Hari as we were going to the Albert Hall to see Cirque du Soleil, what a great find. I had heard of the hotel from a friend and we were impressed from the beginning. Lovely friendly welcome from the door and reception staff. The room  was lovely, beautifully clean. Very comfy bed and great linen. The hotel is in a perfect location for Knightsbridge shopping which of course had to be done! Nice lunch at Harvey Nicholls. Some great restuarants within walking distance of the hotel. Lovely relaxed breakfast, great coffee! Many hotels shout about their great service but fail to deliver on so many levels, this hotel is genuinely good at what a £300 a night hotel should do.  We will be back soon! Thank you for a great stay."
January 2022,Continues to be one of the best hotels in London,"I have stayed many times at the hotel over the past 6 years and it continues to be my hotel of choice in London ,representing superb personal service from the wonderful staff ,a great location and extremely comfortable luxurious rooms and suites."
January 2022,Thank you The Hari again for your hospitality,As always an extraordinary experience   I stayed at The Hari for several times now and again for two nights. I just love this place...The staff is friendly and very helpful and the atmosphere makes you feel like being part of a large family. With the amazing views and a great location it will always be my first choice when I visit central London. I can not recommend enough. 🥰🥰
January 2022,The location is very excellent .. the cleanliness is excellent .. the espresso machine 👌🏻in the room and thanks sabrine🙏🏻🙏?,"The hotel is very beautiful in terms of the design of the lobby and the restaurant, as well as the arrangement of the comfortable rooms and the marble bathroom, which is an excellent area and the cleanliness is excellent. The staff are comfortable and helpful. The location is very excellent, close to everything"
January 2022,Home away from home,"... if I could afford it. I would move in. They were beyond wonderful to both me and my dog ! From the reception, amazing room service, best hotel slippers and comfortable bedding ... not to mention my favourite hotel bar/lounge in London! Perfection. "
December 2021,Always exceptional,"Choosing to stay at The Hari is guaranteeing an exceptional experience.   It is in an excellent location (walking distance from London Victoria train station, the V&A museum, Natural History Museum, Sloane Square etc.).   What I personally enjoy most is the fact that whilst it is a luxury boutique hotel, the service and welcome that you receive is always so warm and welcoming. All the staff will make conversation with you, ask if there’s anything else that you need (and often leave a little extra treat in your room, as pictured!).   I haven’t had the chance to try the gym yet, but I know that if I do the facilities will be great. Plus, I would highly recommend eating at the restaurant Il Pampero for high quality Italian food!"
December 2021,Exceptional hotel in Belgravia,"A wonderful hotel, well located close to hyde park, harrods and several good restaurants, clean and large rooms with a great view, nice lounge/bar area, very friendly staff. One should try the vegan burger and truffle fries! Definitely recommended!"
December 2021,Legendary experience,I  and my girlfriend visited your hotel on the 24 th December around 7 pm  and both of us we were amazed by the amazing and remarkable experienced we had. Both of us we were served by Naomi the bar supervisor she recommend the strargazer cocktail which it was beautifully executed by the phenomenal bartender Giuseppe. Both of them they were super professional and very engaging. After the cocktais l Naomi and Giuseppe recommend  the italian wine AUTOCTONI. i can't recommend you enough this experience.

December 2021,Amazing,"I had an amazing time at the Hari. Marta the manager was amazing , can’t wait to come back again . Design of the hotel is incredible.  . Atmosphere was great . Thank you to all the team great hospitality"
December 2021,Exceeded expectations!,"This was our second visit and I’m so glad we came back! We had a couple of small issues during the first visit however the manager at the time took all our feedback and we re arranged to come back. Excellent warm welcome from reception and the hotel has a lovely scent when you step in to the lobby. We had room 703 and would definitely recommend the suites, they are spacious and our room was a corner room with great views out over London. We also received a surprise of chocolate and bubbles in the room which was much appreciated. A hand written note welcoming us back, all the small things really make you feel welcome. We didn’t get a chance to stop by the bar this time which was a shame but I highly recommend you do this as drinks were really great last time and service to match.…"
December 2021,Great hotel and location,"Very nice property and attentive staff. I particularly appreciated the black out electric shade, haven't slept so late in years. Also great location. Not the crazy London tourist feel but only a few blocks from excellent retail, would definitely return."
December 2021,Great hotel for a London break,"From the minute you enter, the hotel staff can’t do enough for you. We visited as a family and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The location is great for shopping and local eateries. The bar at the hotel had a great atmosphere.  Overall the hotel has a personal feel and a gem of a find…"
December 2021,It was HARI-mazzzing !,"I went to the Hari a few times and I can tell that I have never found a place as good as this. Everything was great ! The entire staff was amazing and made me feel so welcome. If you are looking for an exceptional experience where each detail is tailored made for you. Just book it as I cannot wait to return. Yes, it has become my home away from home.   Thank you to the staff, especially to John who I had a pleasure to meet."
December 2021,The place to stay above any other in London.,"When the world is volatile and verging on crazy, the Hari provides a tranquil, beautiful, safe and home like setting in the middle of Belgravia. Recently stayed at the Hari and everything was perfect! The room, lounge bar, terrace and gym were all great - I’d recommend this place above any hotel in a London!"
December 2021,Wonderful hotel and people,"We spent a long holiday weekend in London at The Hari. The hotel property, inside and out, is beautiful and exactly as advertised. The Hari Suite room we had was comfortable, super clean, lovely. What impressed us most was the people at the hotel … totally helpful, friendly, nice, available from the first exchange at the check in desk to our checkout. We loved it here and would definitely stay here in any future trip to London. "
December 2021,Awesome!,"Really loved the bar, and the environment. The decoration was really nice! If someone could experience I would recommend to enjoy at least one of the many cocktails! 😁 Couldn't had been attended better, the staff (if I didn't forgot the names: Marta, Naomi, Ariana and Sandra) that served us was very attentive and funny! Great experience!"
December 2021,Thank you so much,"Andrew, Aleks, Matt and of course the rest of the team, thank you so very much for taking care of us...again! Nothing is off the table with this crew in regards to the hospitality we received. My vocabulary runs out of superlatives in how best to describe this hotel........"
November 2021,Amazing,"Amazing experience, really nice selection of spirits, the staff was execellent. We want to thanks Marta for the professional service provided! We are looking forward to be back at the harri!  So lovely atmosphere!"
November 2021,Extremely pleasant,"A great experience with a great host, with an extremely pleasant yet pleasant staff from entry until you’re at your room. First time at the hotel and surely and hopefully will not be the last as The Hari will be the first hotel to be on the list for future visits to London."
September 2021,A Precious Jewel!,"What an amazing gem of a place to call home for a few days! Our first experience in London straight from Heathrow at 7:00 AM on a Sunday morning, greeted by a full staff ready to exceed every expectation. Marzia and Richardo, and the door men who greeted us, where the first in a line of professionals who met our every need and answered all our questions.  The surprise treats in the room, perfect dining recommendations, and the lovely craft cocktails at the bar made us feel like VIPs for four days. We cannot express enough gratitude for making 35 wedding anniversary like our honeymoon ❤ ♥.  Thank you all, we will return!"
September 2021,Wedding anniversary celebration,Just spent our Anniversary at the Hari and could not have been more impressed  From the moment we arrived to the moment of check out it was truly amazing  The staff went that extra mile to make our stay special with complimentary fizz and upgrade  I am planning my next visit already as a Christmas pressie to myself and my daughter   Well done Hari team and thank you   Sharon
September 2021,Enjoyable visit but not sure it lives up to the hype,If you read the other reviews it is entirely right that The Hari receives a range of praise and accolades but can I say it knocked me off my feet? Probably not.   The rooms (suite) and bar area were nice enough and the service is very good but I can’t say it’s the most interesting of places to spend time in or particularly memorable. Breakfast was good.
September 2021,Wonderful Hotel Experience,We visited the Hari for our wedding.  From the moment we arrived the staff made us feel super welcome and were constantly looking for little details that would make our stay even more lovely.  The hotel itself is very well presented with an eclectic decor done to a very good standard.  The breakfasts in particular were fantastic.  We loved every minute of our time at the Hari and will be returning!
September 2021,Amazing bottomless brunch,"Amazing brunch and atmosphere, Vito was amazing in looking after us and the whole team is just so attentive. They even have amazing gluten free pasta, I had the clams spaghetti and the vitello tonnato, but the  tiramisu is to die for, too bad is quite small as I would have gladly ordered another one. Loved the live music too."
September 2021,Such an amazing time!,"I came to to the restaurant Il pampero to try the new brunch with a friend and I have to say that it’s one of the best experience I’ve had! The food and the offering is great, a lot to choose from wether you want a traditional dish or go for oysters or one of the Italian speciality. On top of that they offer options for bottomless and I must say the quality of the drinks is also 5 stars ⭐️!  The team who I knew from before was as always amazing, especially Sante, Vittorio and Nando!  Congratulations to the GM who is leading these amazing people!!  Can’t wait to be back!!!"
August 2021,Amazing experience,"Had an amazing experience at the restaurant  today with a friend. We didn’t book and walked in and were so warmly welcomed from the door to the restaurant staff that we decided to have lunch. The food, drinks and service was just spot on! The atmosphere made us travel away from London’s busy streets. I will definitely recommend and go back. Can’t wait to visit again. Thank you to Nando and Alex and the rest of the team who were exceptional."
August 2021,Amazing!,"Beautiful, spacious room with top-class amenities, perfect for relaxing in the evening. Outstanding breakfast with friendly service and delicious pancakes! Staff were very accommodating and went above and beyond to deliver a top-quality service. Would definitely love to stay here again and would highly recommend."
August 2021,"Friendly staff,fantastic service with that personal touch","lovely quiet location. Beautiful hotel with spacious rooms including great amenities and a really comfortable bed.Staff were very pleasant and accommodating,always a smile. We as a family stayed at this hotel as we were going to be visiting  Warner Brother Studio tour. On our arrival to the hotel room we were greeted with a tray of beautiful individually designed chocolates surrounding the Harry Potter Crest, this was such a very impressive personal touch !! and my daughters were thrilled,this showed they cared. A stay to remember,highly recommended."
August 2021,Great escape away from the hustle and bustle,"We stayed for our wedding anniversary and this place was just fantastic in a fantastic part of the city. We were upgraded which was a touch. The staff, rooms, amenities are all top class. Ok it doesn’t have an on-site carpark but 6 minutes walk away is Q-park which was £55 for 24 hours, but the car is safe and secure and rubbing shoulders with some expensive metal. But overall great place, great location and worth the money "
October 2021,It's ok,"Good location, lovely staff but our room was a little tired looking. Cleaning was ok but for the price I would think it would be absolutely spotless. It's London so I expect limescale but could see it on shower door, stains on chair and tired looking rug which I dared not step on with bare feet.   Lovely terrace bar and lovely staff however. "
October 2021,Best Bartender Ever,Pepe and Juan and Louise are the best ! Best cocktails and service ! Ever ! I feel like they are family! And More💜 I felt very welcomed in The hari everytime I see them ! They always smile ! ALWAYS ! Even on the worst days
October 2021,Amazing! 5 star and Dog Friendly!,"Thank you for an amazing stay! Firstly, the hotel is stunning and you really have thought about every detail. All of the staff were so attentive, professional and could not do enough for us to ensure we had a super stay. We were so impressed with the service provided to our two small dogs. The staff are so welcoming and the hotel has everything a dog could need and more! They loved their doggy treats! We have never experienced such a wonderful dog friendly hotel, thank you! Thank you so much! We will definitely be back!"
October 2021,A touch of Luxury,"Very attenuative staff and looked after from the front door in and out.  Beautiful rooms, comfy bed and fantastic shower. London Belgravia perfect base. Great choice of Drinks and Cocktails Lovely breakfast. "
September 2021,A chilled weekend,"WE had a postponed weekend at The Hari , we just needed to chill . And bot did we . From the moment we arrived we had ""just the right amount ' of service , we were helps and assisted but not bothered , all the team at The Hari seem to instinctively know when we needed help. All the team were brilliant. Thank YOU"
October 2021,"Excellent service, comfortable and stylish room","The staff at the Hari went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed, including advising on covid testing and making us comfortable when we arrived before our room was ready. The Hari is smaller than some other top London hotels but I find that an asset and would compare it favorably with them."
October 2021,Fantastic week-end,"A hidden gem in the middle of very in a very exclusive area .  From the moment you arrive at the Hari you are made to feel very welcome. The location is great, close to Buckingham palace, and also 3 tube station, within 10 minutes  walk,  giving it great access to the rest of London. The bedroom was sparkling clean with some lovely finishing touches . Can't wait for a return visit. A credit to all the staff."
October 2021,Amazing,"I had a great time at the hari , Marta and vittorio were very welcoming. Amazing drinks . And a cool vibe  All the staff are very welcoming and nice , had a greasy evening in the bar and restaurant . Highly recommend"
September 2021,Hooray for the Hari!,"A wonderful welcome by the receptionist, assistance by the Porter and even the maintenance team, who cut through the padlock on our suitcase as we’d miss-placed our key, made our initial impression one of outstanding hospitality.  The room was extremely well furnished, with all the expected high end touches for a hotel in Belgravia. A minor inconvenience were the bedroom doors closing mechanism which did not dampen the door from hitting the jamb; so irregular noise as adjoining rooms closed their doors.  The post booking and pre-arrival emails were the best digital marketing we have experienced; with numerous suggestions as to how we could enjoy our stay."
September 2021,Wonderful hotel,"Our daughters organised an overnight stay with breakfast as a surprise 50th Wedding Anniversary present. The hotel was amazing, and all the staff attentive and helpful. We had a lovely large room on the 6th floor , exceptionally clean , super comfortable bed and pillows and we  were really surprised when a chilled bottle of wine and yummy chocolates were delivered to our room courtesy of the management. .Thank you so much !  The reception staff were exceptionally helpful when we had a problem in the restaurant with our breakfast. (See separate review). They dealt with this immediately and professionally."
June 2021,Gem of a hotel!,"We had booked tickets for the Chelsea Flower Show and decided to make a weekend of it and booked The Hari for a couple of nights. Great location - away from all the hustle and bustle, but just a few minutes walk away from Chelsea and Knightsbridge. Hotel definitely has a boutique feel about it - stylishly furnished. Super classy but understated. The rooms are great - views from the 10th floor are superb! Restaurant and bar are great (try the bottomless brunch!) However it is definitely the staff that make this hotel memorable - nothing it too much trouble and everyone is so friendly, taking time to chat and ask about your day. This hotel is a must!"
June 2021,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed at The Hari for my son’s 21st birthday party in London. Even though the party was not in the hotel, they got every detail right, upgraded our rooms and even laid on a birthday cake. Despite having to shut during the lockdown, the owners and management have got the property back into tip top condition. The staff are all charming - doesn’t matter which part of the hotel they work in, they are just friendly, efficient and polite. The rooms are comfortable and bathrooms really well equipped. Overall, I couldn’t recommend this hotel more - it is certainly on par, if not better than some of its higher priced rivals. Thank you The Hari - a really excellent stay."
June 2021,The Hari- elegant and luxurious,"The hotel was glamorous and stylish and the staff were impeccable. Nothing was too much trouble and our stay was comfortable and chic. We would recommend to anyone visiting the City and would return in a heartbeat. The best night's sleep you can get in London, lovely terrace bar, fantastic food and wonderful staff all made our trip very special."
May 2021,Boutique hotel in a wonderful location,"One of my favourite hotels in London, the location is excellent especially for warmer days when walking is an option. The rooms are spacious and reasonably priced compared to London hotels of the same standard. The bathrooms are gorgeous, and so is the service of the staff. Would definitely come here again!"
June 2021,STUNNING BAR,"We were in this venue yesterday evening - me and my friend - and it was just great! Marta and Vittorio were very welcoming and friendly - and Giuseppe who served us was just amazing, and so were the drinks he prepared for us!! 100% recommended!!"

June 2021,Stunning hotel and impeccable service..,"My husband and I stayed here recently during a little birthday trip to London.  First of all, the staff were incredibly welcoming and friendly from start to finish. Absolutely everything was perfect. They went above and beyond to make our stay so special. We do normally stay somewhere else but decided to have a change - I'm so glad we did!   The hotel itself is exquisitely designed with a luxurious yet laid back and relaxed style within a great location. The room we stayed in was an absolute dream, beautiful perfectly comfortable and very well equipped.   We had a beautiful meal in the restaurant and again, everything was so perfect. We had eaten at a prestigious restaurant a couple of weeks previously and the food here completely blew that out of the water.  We can't wait to…"
June 2021,New favourite London Hotel,I’ve stayed in many 5 star hotels in London but The Hari is by far the best. The staff are so attentive and nothing is too much trouble for any of them. The location of the hotel is great for shopping. We ate in the hotel restaurant on the Friday evening and both the food and the service were outstanding
June 2021,Fabulous place ,"We had a delightful one-night stay at The Hari. It’s a beautiful boutique hotel located in the confines of Belgravia.  The staff are very friendly and welcoming on arrival, check in was swift and they kindly upgraded us to a better room. It had been a very wet and miserable day-we must have looked like drowned rats on arrival- and we were pleasantly surprised to hear a knock on the door; they had sent up some complimentary hot chocolates for to warm us up. Much appreciated!  The room was very nice, bed comfy. We had drinks on the terrace which was decorated with flowers and chic lighting.  Overall it’s a great hotel and we would definitely return. "
June 2021,Loved it - total perfection - booking our return!,"Loved this hotel for many reasons.  Firstly the staff - they treat you like a guest in their home - very welcoming, super friendly, very professional, nothing is too much.  Perfect Belgravia location - especially if you want to go shopping!  Stylish looking interior and very comfy rooms that are very well considered from a practical perspective.  Loved the totally leafy outlook  and quiet location- not what you expect in London.  Great bar/ lounge area with gret menu.  Nice little touches like bikes that you can use,  mini bar in the room rate.   Perfect if you are after a boutique kind of experience - not a large impersonal hotel.  Booking our next stay.  Can't say enough.  THANK YOU!!!!"
June 2021,Such friendly and helpful staff,"A great overnight stay following a wedding reception - the staff were so friendly and helpful - nothing was too much trouble. Lovely light and airy room with a great view, and a delicious breakfast. The team were so helpful in the run up to our stay too - advising on travel and booking a hair appointment. "
June 2021,Premium Service Delivery,"I had a fantastic time at the Hari. One lady stood out to us. Her name is Binta. She is the kindest and most professional staff we met. She was very knowledgeable, she was prompt, friendly and supportive with helpful ideas. I will return to the Hari because of the lovely time and impression we had.   Welldone Guys!"
July 2021,Birthday weekend,"We have just returned from a weekend in London to celebrate my Birthday and chose to stay at The Hari following the fantastic reviews we read online.   The Hari is a beautiful boutique hotel situated in a the stunning area of Belgravia, a 7 minute walk from Knightsbridge tube which is really handy.   Upon arrival we were greeted by the concierge who couldn’t have been more friendly and helpful, asking about our weekend and asking if we were celebrating an occasion. I mentioned it was my birthday and usually when I’ve stayed in other 5* hotels we would usually expect to be offered a celebratory drink, but not at this hotel. The couple in front who were celebrating an anniversary were however offered a drink and a room that was ready early for them, we were however greeted by a…"
July 2021,"A must stay! Excellent staff, service, food, and neighbourhood.","Came to have a staycation this past weekend, and celebrate my birthday. The neighbourhood: Knightsbridge / Belgravia is really quiet and lovely with tons of incredible shopping and food. Easy to walk anywhere you'd like to go. The hotel: The staff was amazing! They surprised me with the most incredible cake and cocktails when I arrived. They were also always there for a lovely conversation or to help in any way they could. Exceptional staff and service. Room service: During our stay, we ordered room service multiple times and the food was great - especially loved the Korean fried chicken and the chicken gyoza. They also have excellent cocktails. The room: Our room (King Premium) was lovely. It had the nicest sofa by the window, which was nice to read in and watch the city. The…"
June 2021,Our New Home in London,"We had not visited London for over a year and decided with the relaxation of Covid regulations that now would be a good time to visit. We were not wrong on many fronts but our choice of a new hotel to stay at was our best decision.We arrived,by car,to be greeted as though we were long lost friends. Suitcases were whisked away and we were shown to reception who had all our details and didn't  have to go through the annoying procedure that sometimes happens whereby you ask where the details you used to book have disappeared to? Shown to our room which was a Studio King and it was excellent.Lots of space and a fabulous bathroom -with a view!.The blackout blinds in the bedroom were perfect for somebody who likes a dark room to sleep in. Housekeeping happened like magic and every…"
July 2021,Our place in Belgravia,"This is our favourite hotel in London. Great location just off Belgravia Square. Good size rooms with all the amenities you could want, nice bar, smart restaurant and excellent staff. If we are in London we are at The Hari."
July 2021,PURE EFFORTLESS LUXURY,"We stayed at The Hari as going to Wimbledon.  Every aspect of the hotel was first class.  The location is great just a short walk from Sloane Square, and surprisingly very quiet allowing for a great nights sleep.  Every little detail had been well thought out, from the bikes to the art to the books.  The service was excellent, nothing too much trouble.  We left feeling feeling very special.  Definitely my favourite hotel in London."

July 2021,Elegant dinner and very well looked after,"I went to Il Pampero - the Italian restaurant inside the hotel - for a fancy dinner with a friend to celebrate a work success. We were given a welcome cocktail made with Recioto which tasted like heaven. I ordered the Tiramisu starter which was delicious, then a lovely octopus with fennels, both well presented and with flavours well paired. We were constantly looked after by the lovely Sante, Matteo the chef came to say hi and so did the beverage manager, who suggested us what wine to pair with our dinner. Lovely!!!"
July 2021,Best London Hotel Ever!,"We have just returned from this hotel where we stayed for 2 nights. The service and attention to detail was apparent from the outset, nothing was too much trouble. It had a really lovely atmosphere where all the staff appeared to enjoy their job and went out of the way to ensure that our stay was a special one. I can't remember all the staff's names so i apologise if I have missed anyone but special thanks to Dominic for arranging balloons and wine in our room and ensuring our rooms were near each other as we had two rooms. Ben for arranging a luxury transfer to our restaurant, Diego for ensuring that it all went smoothly and Ricardo for his friendly persona and making time each day to ask us how we were and what our plans were. We had drinks in the bar which was beautiful and…"

May 2021,Superb London Hotel,Best premium Hotel in London. Fabulous facilities but what makes the Hari stand out above the rest is the quality of the staff. Professional but with a genuine human touch. Attentive without being intrusive and great help with all requests large or small.
May 2021,Outstanding Concierge Staff!,"Excellent experience, especially with the assistance I received from the concierge staff.  The Head Concierge, Ben Malpass, and Diego were extremely responsive and helpful on a number of occasions and under special circumstances.  They went way out of their way for me and well above the call of duty.  Rarely will you find a concierge staff as helpful as the team at The Hari.  Very much appreciated!"
April 2021,Stands out from the crowd,"Had an exceptional stay at The Hari.  Whilst I had high expectations from a 5 star hotel my expectations were surpassed.  The staff were exceptional, so friendly and go above and beyond for their guests.  Whilst you would expect this from a 5 star hotel, I was taken aback by the warmth, friendliness and I have to say the sincerity of the staff.  The hotel itself also reflects this with lots of lovely intimate seating areas making it feel warm and  welcoming, but modern and very chic. If you are looking for a truly unique hotel stay for whatever the occasion then you’ve got to try The Hari. Needless to say, I will definitely be coming back."
May 2021,Very welcoming and safe,Booked The Hari for a business trip and was greeted by a exceptionally friendly team who were very accommodating. My highlight was being able to have a few drinks on the heated rooftop terrace whilst. Highly recommend a visit if looking for a hotel in this area or even a few social drinks.
May 2021,Best night of 2020/2021,"Such a treat to get to stay at this hidden Belgravia gem after so many nights in my own bed! The staff instantly transform into friends; all incredibly welcoming and genuinely attentive . We stayed in the stunning Studio Suite overlooking the leafy park which cannot be faulted and being welcomed with a personalised amenity was such a lovely surprise. Cannot rate this hotel enough - the people, the ambience and the beautiful terrace - The Hari should be everyone's first port of call to escape their homes after the last year! Thanks to all xx"
May 2021,The best hotel I’ve ever been to,"We stayed at the Hari for my 50th birthday and I was so overwhelmed by the amazing service and kindness shown by all the staff. Everyone went over and above to make my birthday stay a very special one. We were given a very warm welcome when we arrived and I was wished a happy birthday. We were given a room upgrade and shown around the hotel. Our car was parked and cases brought to our room. We went shopping and were given an umbrella on our way out as the sky looked at bit dark.  When we returned there was a big balloon in my room, my favourite drink and a card which was such an amazing touch. We then went for dinner and again my birthday was acknowledged by the lovely staff and the food and service was first class in so many ways. The room was beautiful and very comfortable. I…"
April 2021,"Astounding, Kind, Exceptional","Stayed at the Hari for the night, the staff were amazing! We loved the personal touch on the entry into our suite. They were exceptionally attentive to our needs and we're following the guidelines so so well. I realised that if you are kind to them, they will always be super generous and kind to you,going the extra mile. Absolutely awesome! Can't wait to stay again"
April 2021,The Friendly Staff of The Hari,The staff is incredible. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. Always greeting you and asking if there is anything you need or what they can do for you. The guest relations manager even left a bag of treats in my room for my flight home. 
April 2021,Lovely hotel,"Beautiful hotel with a nice room layout. Received a complimentary upgrade which added to the experience.   The hotel staff were all very friendly and very professional - exactly what should be expected from all hotels, but isn’t always the case. "
April 2021,Excellent Bar & Restaurant,"Went to the terrace for celebration catch up post lockdown. Perfect outdoor space, to meet with friends.  Excellent service, cocktails and atmosphere. Would recommend 100% to all visiting South London."
December 2020,Beautiful terrace at The Hari,"A few friends & I were looking for somewhere to have some drinks & a bite to eat to celebrate the easing of lockdown and catch up after a year of not seeing one another, and stumbled across The Hari’s terrace having seen it advertised on a few Instagram pages.   From booking the table, to leaving the hotel - the staff were always attentive and keen to make the visit special - and it really was.   We had the most fantastic night, the service was brilliant and quick, the food was delicious (The Hari Club was a particular favourite, but the truffle chips were equally devine !) and unlike many other places I’ve seen - it was well heated and ventilated - so we felt safe & warm.   We’ll definitely be back!  "
December 2020,A Hidden Gem,"We were recommended this hotel as we needed to be within walking distance of Knightsbridge. The Hari is a hidden gem that oozes charm and style whilst embracing the very essence of British hospitality. This is a very chic boutique hotel with service to match. Rooms are well appointed and very comfortable and importantly for central London it was very peaceful enabling a perfect night's sleep. Breakfast was perfect and our waitress from Argentina (Maria I think?) couldn't do enough for us. The reception team were really sincere in their welcome and genuinely appreciated our custom, we will certainly return and can't recommend highly enough."
December 2020,Perfect hotel in central London,Now our go to hotel in London - feels like a home from home. Very warm welcome and the warmth and quality doesn’t deteriorate throughout the stay. Have stated a couple of times in recent months. Difficult to fault any aspect of the rooms and overall ambience. Thank you to the team for another great stay. Here’s to a less turbulent 21 for hoteliers.
October 2020,Great hotel with fantastic Staff,We stayed at the hotel with friends whilst we visited London. The hotel was fantastically clean and the staff were brilliant. We spent a great night in the bar drinking and enjoying some of the bar food. The only negative I took away from staying was the lack of milk in the room to make a coffee however the room service was phenomenal and quickly delivered those much needed morning coffee
October 2020,Uk,"I stayed in the hari for the first time and I am sure it won’t be the last , I really enjoyed every single thing in this place , lobby area is cosy, bar is just a cool place to have my cigar, and the rooms are fabulous. I really love the location which is close to everywhere I have to go in my weekend. Special thanks to Sabrine in front desk who welcomed us with a warm smile offered a very nice complimentary room upgrade and always checking if we are happy. Thanks to the hari team and see you soon."
March 2020,A slice of paradise!,"Upon arrival we we're greeted and escourted inside. After a breif encounter, myself and my partner headed inside to escape the typical British weather, where we were greeted by drinks arranged prior. Fabulous decor and sense of hospitality by this point was already something i'd had yet to experience, after a decade of living in london! I was sipping my drink and completely forgot about our luggage, lo and behold, the porter had already taken them to our room!   The staff were helpful to say the least, and best of all, genuinely friendly and hospitable.   The room to say it was good would be an understatement, it was great. The views of London from the room we were in was spectacular, and a fridge with some gin topped off the evening.   I cant reccomend a better value, opulent…"
March 2020,Another Fantastic stay !,"We returned to the Hari for a nights stay and wasn’t disappointed, from our warm welcome and attentive door staff arranging our valet to the lovely reception team. Our room was perfect with a great view and in such a lovely location.  Would highly recommend"

February 2020,Best option in Knightsbridge / Belgravia,"Not my first time here, but delighted to see that the standards remain top. Sincere congratulations to Mr. Dimitris, superintendant on the bar and restaurant; exceptional level of service and professionalism. All crew members deserve sincere congratulations. The asset is ""NYC within the heart of London"". Keep it up - see you next time around. "
February 2020,Amazing Hotel in London,"Great location, fantastic room and amazing staff. The Hari has everything you need to enjoy a weekend in London or to accommodate a business trip. Special mention to Alex that made our stay memorable. See you soon the Hari."
February 2020,OUTSTANDING EXPERIENCE ,"I wanted to leave a comment for this hotel because I work in the same industry and I have never felt this good in an hotel for so long!! Actually felt like at home, each people working in this structure are super friendly and careful, from the guys at the main entrance, passing by reception and concierge, going through the bar and the people working in housekeeping and concluding with the GM. THANK YOU SO MUCH, I can't wait to be back with you guys!!! Best of luck, Alessandro Mazzone "
February 2020,"Great People, Attentive & Friendly Service, Great Location","Rooms are very clean, with thoughtful amenities and extras. The staff are very friendly and appear to be caring and thoughtful. All are very helpful and polite.  They also appear to be genuine and non-scripted, which is very nice and sometimes hard to find in high-end luxury hotels."
February 2020,The kindest people ever,"I have stayed in many hotels all over the world and never encountered such kind and gentle staff. Starting from reservation to reception to all who were in service. They never said no to any of our requests, accommodating and warm the staff were always there to answer any request or question. Breakfast is of excellent choices and was lucky to have dinner at their Italian restaurant. Rooms are relatively small and in particular the toilet yet it is compensated with excellent service. Thank you"
February 2020,Amazing hotel bar,"Surely one of the Best hotel bars I have ever been. Great - Cozy atmosphere, everything was as I expected. Very good service. Staff members were friendly, polite and positive. I would definitely recommend it."

October 2020,Excellent location and such an amazing customer service ,"I really enjoyed my stay at Hari, the service is exceptional and tailored at best for each guest. Felt really special. The rooms are clean and modern, and the bed is the best I have ever slept on! Hope to be back very soon."
October 2020,Great location,The Hari is in a great location close to many shops restaurants and landmarks. The staff were great and nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice. Would certainly stay again
October 2020,our home away from home,"The Hari is a hotel like no other. We always love staying here, everything from the ambience to the very personal service is perfect. We love the beds, the breakfast and a glass of wine in the bar. I would say we are true fans:)"
October 2020,Another 5* stay,We stay at the Hari every time we visit London and each time is as special as the last. The service is incomparable and the staff always go out of their way to make you feel special. The adaptations they’ve made to comply with ever changing government guidelines provides a safe and reassuring environment whilst not comprising on luxury. Would highly recommend to anyone wanting to escape in a home away from home.
October 2020,Fantastic,Great service. Very helpful and attentive staff. Excellent service. The restrauants and bars provided excellent food and drink and in a good ambience.  Room of a high standard and comfortable. The room service especially for cocktails late at night was great 
October 2020,Beautiful hotel and you get a lot for your money!,"There are only good things I can say about this hotel! The location is amazing, the design great and the staff is extremely polite and helpful. We enjoyed our stay very much and already recommended this hotel to a few people. The price in relation to what you get is amazing, especially for London! Anytime again!"
September 2020,Fab ,"Having stayed in September we decided to come back and we were so glad we did  Absolutely love this hotel staff rooms etc all outstanding, having stayed all over the world and never staying in the same place twice, we loved this place so much had to come back  Cannot rate this hotel enough"
February 2020,Amazing cocktail bar ,"I’ve been there a couple of times for a drink with friends, staff is nice and qualified, comfy sofas, private terrace and the best cocktails in town made from Giuseppe, his negroni is fantastic. I’ll be back! "
February 2020,Lovely stay but couple of niggles,Just returned from a stay to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We are regular visitors to London but have never stayed at The Hari before. The location is fantastic and doormen and reception staff were very welcoming on arrival. The premium king room was fantastic with a lovely view and all the amenities you would need for a luxury stay.   We had an absolutely beautiful meal in the Italian Il Pampero restaurant.   The one issue I would say is the bar area. Service was pretty slow and there was a constant draft coming from the terrace and front doors of the hotel itself. The bar also had a really strong smell of cigars too which may not be off putting for some but it did make us move down to the sofa in the lobby.  I wouldn’t want to hang around in the bar too long if I went…
February 2020,The Hari Bar,I have visited the bar in the Hari hotel in Belgravia. A really nice place with interesting decoration and a really chilled atmosphere.  The drinks were really good and the weekservice outstanding.  I really recommend it mostly if you want to have a drink during the week.
February 2020,Great Experience!,We spent nine nights at the Hari and the accommodations were superb.  The staff presented themselves with the utmost professionalism.  Always a smile and helping hand every day.  Our room was immaculate and we enjoyed the special touches of the night turnout with sweet treats and a special welcome on our first day and a special goodbye on our last day.  The Hari knows how to make your experience a special one.  A special thank you to Violetta the concierge who was always willing and ready to help us no matter how small the request was.    Highly recommended!!
February 2020,Fantastic room,"Absolutely loved our room with the glass shower wall, beaded curtain- so different! Loved the outside roof type garden. Would highly recommend as it’s well placed to see all the sights London has to offer."
January 2020,"Great modern hotel, fantastic locatiom","I recently stayed at the Hari hotel as part of a business trip. The location is great, close to Hyde Park. The rooms are great and stylish. The hotel has a very nice bar and breakfast room as well. I would recommend this hotel for quick Londond trips. "
February 2020,great hotel,"we arrived in mid-January for a 4-day short vacation and  we booked in this hotel because of the location, the hotel has a nice interior design, looks new, service is really good, we had an issue in our room and they solved the problem very fast, the location is just great, il pampero restaurant we visited for breakfast only and its great"
February 2020,Lovely room and looked after amazingly,"Amazing stay, loved the room and all my needs were tended to, including an extra heater because I was cold!! The room was beautiful and loved the bathroom. Breakfast was great, can’t wait to come back!"
February 2020,First class in heart of Belgravia ,"This was my 3rd stay at The Hari, and I love everything about this hotel.  The warm informal reception and greeting, stylish spacious rooms with lovely views, and the superb location.   The concierge desk is highly professional and will help with anything you need, theatre bookings/shopping tips/cars etc.  Highly recommended!!!"

January 2020,Couldn't recommend enough,"We went to the Hari for my wife's birthday and we couldn't have made a better choice! Stunning bedroom, amazing view, nice amenities awaiting in our room. The staff were just perfect: very professional, polite, helpful but not intrusive. Loved it!!!"
January 2020,Amazing modern hotel on a quiet embassy-area.,"Fantastic service from we arrived to we left. Sophie in the reception know how to welcome the guests, We got a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe room, and later they sent a fabulous gift to our room because of my birthday 2 days before.. Breakfast was a la carte. We didn't try the continental or English breakfast. But had omelette and coffee, which was good. Rooms were big and modern with pop art, and cleaning and room service excellent. The shower could have more pressure.  I will recommend this hotel to everyone who don't want to stay around Oxford street, but near Harrods and the luxury shops on Sloane Street.(5 mins walk)"
January 2020,courtesy even to non residents,"Last Sunday, a slightly rainy day, I walked past the beautiful facade entrance of The Hari. I decided to look inside, just to see if I may stay here on a future trip. (I will). After 10 minutes, I walked out, when I heard a voice behind me shout out ""Sir,"" I looked back, and saw the doorman, waving a small folded umbrella at me. ""Sir, may I offer you an umbrella?"" I hesitated, then walked up to him. I told him I was not a hotel resident. He said, ""I know, sir, I just thought, it would be nice if you had an umbrella."" I accepted the umbrella, and I was very impressed at this young man's knidness. Thank you, Cosmin, it rained a lot later, I would not have been able to continue my walk without the umbrella.  I thought of your kindness and I thank you very much. The Hari should be…"
January 2020,Exceeded all expectations - perfection,"Me and my boyfriend stayed here for one night and we could have stayed a whole month! Upon arrival we were greeted by Kleandra who was very welcoming and pleasant, she really made us feel at home straight away. She showed us to the suite we were staying in and it was beautiful with special touches because we were celebrating our 6 year anniversary. Olga had covered the bed in petals and left a lovely note for us. The room was immaculately clean, and the décor was lovely. The bed was incredibly comfortable with additional blankets if needed. There were plenty of amenities also. The view from the room was great with three balconies to view the skyline from. In the morning we had breakfast in the downstairs restaurant and it continued to exceed our expectations. Nando served us,…"
January 2020,One of the best hotels I've stayed at in years,"Arriving early in the morning after our overnight trans-Atlantic flight, we were welcomed with open arms. The front desk and lobby staff were great, polite yet friendly. Although our room wasn't ready when we got there at 8:30am, they stored our bags and then called us to let us know when our room was ready--at 11:am! The room was stylish, immaculate, and roomy compared to most European hotels. The bed and bath were palatial. We had a room on an upper floor and the view was awesome with the dome of St. Paul's off in the distance. The location on Chesham Place is a lovely refuge just outside the tumult of Knightsbridge. Because it is relatively small, the personal serve and quality of accommodations combine to give this hotel the feel of a much more luxurious spot--particularly…"
January 2020,Value for money in an upmarket part of London,"Having lived in this part of London for years and walked past the hotel regularly, to now stay at The Hari was a very pleasant surprise. Great value for money, attentive staff and, at last, a hotel which does not seek to make money our of everything! the complimentary coffee, water and wifi was a joy. Excellent location and great restaurant. We'll be back!"
January 2020,Perfect hotel to for 50th Anniversary Celebrations,"From check in to checking out, our stay at The Hari was excellent and without any problems. As stated on previous reviews, the staff here do make this such an amazing hotel. Location is excellent, not far from the Tube Station. We had a great two day stay here January 2020, would definitely recommend this Hotel, and we would certainly stay here again."
January 2020,What a great start to 2020,"We very much enjoyed our stay at The Hari .It was really spectacular experience, the hotel location was great . What made us love the hotel the most was the staff, they are incredibly friendly and willing to help us in any way they can. The housekeeping was amazing as well.  Thank you The Hari hotel for a great start to 2020 ♥️"
January 2020,Fabulous hotel within striking distance Knightsbridge and the Royal Parks,I stayed at the Hari with my partner and Cavapoo Chip for a night in December as we wanted to explore the area and walk in the Royal Parks.  Alex and his team were fantastic and couldn’t do enough for us during our stay. The hotel itself is a little slice of tranquility a few steps from the hustle and bustle of Knightsbridge.  It’s great as a base and the bar on the mezzanine level is a great place to relax and watch the world go by.  If you want a hotel with a personal touch that has all the advantages of a luxury chain then The Hari is worth a visit.  You wont be disappointed!  Angelina & Chip xx
December 2019,You would be foolish not to experience this hotel whist in London! ,"Our stay at The Hari London from stepping out of the car has been nothing short of 5* treatment!  Reception and concierge were warm and welcoming not to mention extremely helpful.  Our room was stylish and spacious. Food and beverage staff were extremely attentive, food was sublime and drinks maybe we had too many!   Perfect location for shopping, sightseeing and west end shows etc.   I cannot recommend this hotel any higher. Very LGBTQI friendly too.   This is my 2nd stay at The Hari and it most certainly wont be my last! "
November 2019,The Hari experience,"I would rate my stay at the Hari 10 out of 10. The stuff was very helpful all the time, also they were always cheerful so you started your day happy as soon as you step out of your room. The rooms and the interior of the hotel is very elegantly decorated. The location is also very convenient. Strongly reccomended."
November 2019,Great hotel experience,"Wonderful experience from check-in to check-out.  All hotel staff were extremely efficient, knowledgeable, and helpful.  The room was very nice, and well looked after by the housekeeping staff.  Excellent location within easy walking distance to London tube, shopping, sights, and restaurants."
December 2019,Lovely Hotel," My husband and I were visiting family in Cornwall and wanted to spend a few nights in London to end our trip.  My travel advisor coworker suggested The Hari and it was the perfect choice.   Quite but beautiful neighbourhood. Lots of restaurants and shops around.  We had breakfast and dinner at the hotels restaurant which was lovely.   All the staff were fantastic - ready to help with anything.   Hotel is beautiful - everything from the public areas, elevator, corridors to the room. Beautiful bathrooms, loved the shower, comfy bed and we had a sitting area looking out to the park.   Hotel was also quite - we know there were children on our floor but never heard a peep out of anyone.   We were also celebrating our anniversary and husbands birthday. The hotel left us a bottle of…"
November 2019,My experience with The Hari,"The welcoming was amazing staff were friendly, the bar and the restaurant outstanding. I highly recommend this hotel for couples, the hotel view from my room was excellent and amazing. Location is perfect "
December 2019,Excellent Service and A Good Location,"The staff at The Hari were exceptional.  They were friendly, helpful and welcoming and really made staying at their hotel feel special.  I enjoyed my visit,.  The room was a reasonable size for the location, with a comfortable bed, well-equipped bathroom and some lovely personal touches such as the sweet treats left by the bed every night, something different each time.  The location is very good, just a few minutes walk from Sloane Street.  Although it is a busy area, I found the hotel quiet and peaceful."
December 2019,One of the best hotels in London ,"Very friendly staff, great rooms, great location, easy to access all shopping areas.  We enjoyed our stay and we will definitely come back.  Also we want to thank Sophia from the Hari hotel for all her efforts.  Regards  M.M"
December 2019,Nice hotel,"Lovely hotel.  Great room.  Very helpful and friendly staff. However, the lobby and bar on both evenings we stayed seemed to be full of single men all on their mobile phones!  None of them seemed to be together and it meant that it was difficult getting a seat in the bar.  Not sure what was going on but I certainly felt uncomfortable in the bar even with my  husband.  Such a shame as everything else was great."
December 2019,Wonderful experience:),"I spent a really nice weekend at the Hari hotel, fantastic design and the room was beautiful with all possible comfort. The staff was very professional and kind, and the restaurant downstairs ""Il Pampero"" offers really good Italian cuisine with first choice dishes and an excellent selection of wines. I would definitely recommend both Hotel and restaurant, I would stay here again without a doubt."
December 2019,Amazing,"I love The Hari, and I'll be back next time , I enjoyed every single moment , I really liked The Hari team , they do care about us , and doing every thing possible to make us feel good and happy ,what can I say more than this .? No one can do what you are doing for us guys. "
December 2019,Fabulous From Check In to Check Out,"From the moment we arrived, the staff were fantastic, welcoming and polite.the hotel bar, room and restaurant were equally impressive. Event the checkout was lovely, we will definitely stay here again."
July 2019,Love the hari,Love Vince  helpful and friendly staff i like the place.some days it gets really   busy  The have the best sweet seduction and chicken nugget s The hotel also is really nice and in a prime location however its kind of expensive
August 2019,Its all about the service,"6 night personal stay at the Hari.  Very well located in a quiet yet central part of town,  Very well positioned for shopping in Knightsbridge and Sloane street as well as close to Hyde Park, I would highly recommend taking one of the hotel's bikes and cycling around for an hour or two.  Room was compact but well appointed and very quiet.  Housekeeping was excellent, turndown service, etc was flawless, I wasn't ever disturbed in the morning.  Service was very good, you called down to order ice and 3 minutes later you have it in your room.  Great option in London"
August 2019,The Hari,"I enjoyed my staying at the hari hotel, it is a perfect experience I ever had in London.  Love the location, staff and the cozy environment.  Definitely will book the hotel again in future.  Thank you all."
August 2019,Very relaxing and cool place,"I've been in my first time in the Hari hotel and didn't desapointed. Food in Pampero restaurant was very delicious. After I went to the bar upstairs to have some coctails and it was right place, beautiful atmosphere. The coctails from Alessia was awesome. She were so attentive and friendly. And  all staff was really nice and helpful. I think her name was Vanessa who was really cool and engaging with me. Guys, thank you very much for lovely evening. Ill definitely come back and spread the word to my friends."
August 2019,Good Location & Nice Hotel,"We stayed here for one night on a weekend. The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was clean and comfortable. Not too much of a view from the room (2nd floor). However, the hotel is in a great location. The hotel seemed busy in the evening, but didnt cause any disruption and no noise could be heard in the rooms. "
August 2019,Fabulous hotel,"Due to work I travel too and from London quite a bit and have stayed in many hotels, and in my opinion this is one of the best by far! Just a few minutes from the fabulous shops of Knightsbridge and tube stations getting around is no problem. The rooms are stylish and well equipped with everything you could need and more (I especially liked the sweets treats left in the room on an evening) food in the hotel restaurant is 5*. In all I had an amazing stay and can’t wait for a return trip soon ❤️"
August 2019,Amazing hotel,"We stayed at the hotel for two night whilst in the city for work. From the moment we arrived to the moment we checked out, nothing was any trouble! Rooms are spacious and stylish and have everything you would expect and more from a central london hotel, and maid service twice a day which is a nice touch! A trip that was meant to be work ended up feeling more like a mini break! I cant thank the hotel staff enough for a pleasurable stay and cant wait to stay again! Hope to see you all soon"
August 2019,THE VERY BEST! ,"Let’s start by saying this hotel is The Very Best hotel I’ve stayed in in London!  We arrived at the hotel early at 1pm check in isn’t until 3pm, we were greeted, our bags taken and guided to the bar area where staff worked to allocate us our room as quick as they could even though we were early! Champagne on arrival and made comfortable until we were escorted to our rooms. Rooms are light, airy and spacious, amazing facilities and luxurious to say the least. Best nights sleep I’ve had in a hotel in London.  Breakfast service was simply superb and food quality outstanding.   Concierge we’re extremely attentive and helped us get to work for our show on time without a hitch.   The whole atmosphere of the hotel is warm and friendly and really is a home from home with that added…"
August 2019,Gustavo Munoz,"Very poor front desk atention, I waited 8 hours to get my room after a 14 hours trip. Having a request for early check in with OK. when I got angry my room appear in 5 minutes, was the worst of the hotel as a penalty. Bill a coffe plus a glass of regular water for 20 pounds AS A CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST. Concierge service did not know about Google to get phones for booking, never got one reservation and did for myself."
July 2019,Best experience ever in their Italian restaurant!,We had dinner at this incredible restaurant on Monday the 12th of August and we had no idea we would be in for such a treat. The chef suggested some of his best dishes and we were surrounded by waiters giving the ultimate Italian experience especially when they served the most delicious home made pasta in a pecorino wheel! I thoroughly recommend this little gem if you are looking for a convivial dinner with friends with an authentic Italian feel.
December 2019,Great hotel,"Great location, near the attractions but not too crowded. The design and service of hotel is great as well. The valet parking cost 50 pounds, a bit expensive but it is hard to find a hotel with car park at London centre. We arrive on Thursday, this we have to pay the congestion charge if we go anywhere, because the hotel is just very near the Zone."
November 2019,"If not home, then a close second","Staff is warm, polite, professional, and helpful, without being pompous or fake - they are genuine hoteliers. Chef is exceptional :) Location is excellent. Rooms are comfortable and well appointed. I really like the fact that the bar/lounge area is upstairs, and hence separated from the lobby area downstairs.  It creates more intimacy and cosiness. And of course, saving the best for last: the Secret Garden! As a cigar aficionada, the small but beautiful cigar terrasse was the main reason I booked this hotel the first time, and why I also keep coming back. Thank you great Hari Team!"
December 2019,Amazing ,One of the most beautiful hotels in London .. Close to the shops .. Close to restaurants .. Quiet .. The staff are very friendly and wonderful .. Room service is excellent .. The hotel decor is beautiful and modern .. Attention to the guest and welcoming it is beautiful .. The hotel lobby is distinctive and services it is much better than some big hotels in London .. A visit must be repeated .. Thanks to the staff of this hotel
November 2019,It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas,"Beautiful room, everything was perfect. Staff are attentive and pleasant. Extremely clean and comfortable. Would recommend. Our room overlooked Winter Wonderland. Our room had window seat. We sat in the dark with chilled glasses of wine looking at the view, magical!"
November 2019,THE BEST HOTEL IN THE BEST LOCATION,"everytime i travel for business in London i stay at the Hari hotel, all is amazing, the rooms, the staff, the bar, the food. Hari hotel is also located in the best area, walking distance to London's best zone.  "
November 2019,Fantastic Service in London,"My husband and I spent our 20th wedding anniversary at The Hari. We chose it for all of the 5 star reviews on-line and the location. We were not disappointed. From the moment we arrived to the minute we walked out the door to leave the service was impeccable. The staff helped us arrange tours and pre-pay, guided us on what Tube lines to take and made suggestions on where to eat. Il Pampero was out of the this world both nights we had dinner there. This hotel made us feel special every step of the way. We ended each night with a small bite of chocolate or whatever candy they left by our bed. We definitely plan to return and will definitely stay at The Hari."
December 2018,Excellent Hotel,I was extremely blown away by the incredible service at The Hari. Not only is it beautiful hotel in a great neighborhood but the staff went above and beyond to make sure all our needs were met. Can’t wait to come back here. 
October 2019,The best place,"In London i went to the best hotel the hari, The service was amazing and the hotel had the best donuts in the area. The hotel had bikes for the visitors and when we call for a room service it don’t take 4 minutes,so that’s why it is the best service,the best hotel tourist."
November 2019,An Unforgettable experience in the best area of London,"We visited the hari the previous month for 4 nights.From the day of check-in to the day of departure everything went more than perfect.We had an amazing cozy and beautiful room facing the park, the  sofa net to the window  was the best spot for me and my wife to enjoy our coffee, we absolutely loved it. The staff was very warm and welcoming and they were always willing to help us. The hotel  is located in belgravia a quiet and very beautiful area which is just a few minutes walk  from the tube station and for me personal the best place for shopping,  Harrods. I am sure that I have found my new spot in London.Can't wait to be back."
November 2019,A warm welcome,I couldn’t find another warm place like the unique hotel. The stuff is very well trained to help in all ways. I even were surprised that they offer free mobile to take. That is called a royal treat. Just the thing I need.
August 2019,weekend at the Hari,"we had a very relaxing weekend at the Hari and spent a nice weekend in London with family and friends. room was very nice, but a bit on the small side and the icon can sometimes make  the atmosphere quite dry."
July 2019,Boutique quality,Loved this hotel. A real gem in the middle of Knightsbridge with a great bar and restaurant.  Great rooms beautifully presented but a little on the small side. Staff really personal and knowledgable of the area.
August 2019,Nice boutique hotel in a great location,"I stayed at The Hari with my daughter in July 2019. This was a repeat visit for me as I had stayed there before and loved the hotel and the great location. On check in there was an issue with the room thats was given to me, and the hotel staff resolved it to my satisfaction. I thus wanted to give a note of thanks to both Eleonara at the front desk and her manager Renata for solving the problem. It was this attitude and resolution that made my stay totally comfortable and satisfactory. Rooms are a bit on the smallish side, but not too small as to be uncomfortable. All the room and toilet facilities are great and there is a turndown service every night with some amazing chocolates left on the pillow.  I also need to thank Violetta from the Concierge service who found me tickets to…"

Rooms are all excellent standards with different views of wonderful London. We have stayed here many times as a couple and we have also spent time here with our children ranging from 2 -12 years old the area is great as we like the quiet streets which feel safe and a short walk away from Harrods and Harvey Nichols , a great all rounder hotel you would not be disappointed."
July 2019,The bar  in hari hotel ,From the best bars and hotel in London and the waiters was very friendly and helpful and the food was very delicious specially the pasta and the burgers and from the dessert the donuts I really had a great time 
May 2019,A friend and I spent 11 wonderful days in the care of all the lovely staff at the Hari Hotel London.,We were so impressed with the attention to detail and the friendly helpful staff at the Hari Hotel London.  We will be returning soon!  We have travelled the world and this hotel is at the top of our list.  What a wonderful way to start and end each day!
July 2019,Amazing Hotel,"Nice & clean room, amazing breakfast a la carte, good position.  I enjoyed “The Apple of Belgravia” drink at the bar...recommended!  Kind and welcoking staff, I really bar a good time there with my best friend ! "
November 2019,An enjoyable weekend in London,"Excellent boutique hotel in Belgravia.  Hotel is ideally situated in Belgravia with easy access to many stores and offices. The hotel bedrooms were very comfortable and the staff were accommodating.  We enjoyed the morning breakfast buffet and the bar located on the second floor was convenient.  If traveling for business in London and you need to be in Belgravia or nearby areas of Knightsbridge,  Chelsea or around Hyde Park, then I recommend this hotel."
November 2019,Excellent boutique hotel in Belgravia,"The Hari was a glorious unexpected surprise. The hotel is a home away from home, cozy and welcoming.  However the heart and soul of the hotel are the staff. This joyful gang of young people are extremely warm, attentive, and caring. They are the backbone and heart of the Hari."
July 2019,beatiful hotel,The hari hotel is one of my favourite in london. The rooms are modern and elegant. The service is good and receptive. Ours was a bit noisy because the Windows needed some further sealing but that will be dealt with by the hotel.   Prices are ok considering the quality of the hotel and the service.  Location is pretty convenient as well.
July 2019,Very nice hotel," I am coming from Hong Kong  with my family , and I choose to come back again ,All the staff there are so nice and friendly , and specially Subine is very helpful and offer a tea for me with their lovely  biscuit"
May 2019,"Excellent Hotel, Excellent Location","We wanted a hotel where we could easily walk to many things and The Hari is perfectly located for that. Approx 15-20 minute walk to Buckingham Palace. As others have mentioned its easy access to Harrods and other sights. Excellent, helpful staff ensuring a welcome every time we returned from our travels. Belgravia is a lovely suburb with elegant buildings and very quiet. After spending our days walking, we didn’t want to venture too far for dinner. We ate at the hotel (very nice) and found a couple of pubs and restaurants within a reasonable distance of the hotel."
November 2019,Absolutely fabulous - this is a lovely hotel that has become my home away from home,"What can I tell about The Hari apart from it's now one of my favourite hotels in the world. I absolutely love it! Not only is the location perfect - you can pop into Mayfair, the central shopping areas + go for strolls in Hyde Park really easily but what makes this hotel so special are the wonderful staff. From the front desk to the concierge everyone really cares that you have a great stay there. Alex the front desk manager is really attentive and his focus on the detail means everything is well catered for. The restaurant serves delicious Italian food and the head chef, Claudio is as passionate about his craft as I am about eating it! The concierge team are flawless - they managed to help us navigate around London. Every single recommendation was spot on...from dinner +…"
November 2019,The hari bar .,"Hello , it was really excellent work from the manager and the team, everything was really good and im very thankful for them . The service was more than good , the food , how they treated the customers and the terrace organization was something that literally not every bar have it in the way the the Hari bar have it . thankyou for the awesome staff , thankyou for the really good manger."
August 2019,Nice Spot!,"This hotel was very nice had a very stylish vibe. My only complaint is that the rooms are much smaller than depicted on the website, and it is a little bit of a walk to the nearest tube station. Other than that we had a very nice stay."
October 2019,Amazing stay overall,"This hotel should be a national treasure. Their staff is beyond incredible and the hotel itself is so comfortable and had all the amenities. As far as location at first glance it looks far off but it’s in such a nice quiet neighborhood that is within walking distance to everything you could need.  Their rooms are average size for London and they have turndown service. They were so accommodating and helpful during our entire stay.  The doormen were absolutely wonderful and helped with the stroller and our bags, anything we needed. I was beyond impressed and will choose this hotel again in the future."
October 2019,Excellent Stay,I stayed at The Hari for one night and had a great stay. All the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable. We had dinner in the restaurant il Pampero which was excellent with very authentic Italian cuisine. My pasta was cooked perfectly and we enjoyed chatting a quick the head chef when he visited our table. The bed was comfortable and the room quiet overlooking the square with a great view in the morning. Breakfast was also very good with a selection of interesting and tasty smoothies. The gym was well equipped for a quick workout. I would definitely stay again.
October 2019,"Amazing hotel ,Staff & location ","I would like to thank The Hari team , From check in , Concierge, restaurant till check out . They did efforts to make this vacation memorable.  I stayed in a jr suit that was sunny , good size and beautifully decorated . The hotel staff is generous and brought a Champagne as a gift for my wife Bday (and additional  sweets)... I will definitely come back. Cheers  Yaron"
September 2019,"Comfortable, delicious, impeccable","My Partner and I have chosen The Hari and Il Pampero to celebrate his birthday. From the moment we walked in, greeted by the amazing staff, followed by personalised welcome card and treats, we could not have asked for more. The bed was one of the most comfortable we have ever slept and our dinner at Il Pampero was a real treat for all our senses. The whole staff has so attentive, friendly and professional and were actually the stars of our Hari experience. A special thank you to Violeta from the amazing concierge team who looked after us during our stay, Dominic and Alex. From Il Pampero Victorio and Leo offered great suggestions for dishes and cocktails."
October 2019,THE HARI,"I had one of best staying in London at The Hari hotel and that's because of following reasons: 1. Location is great ,quiet ,secured and close to hyde park ,Harrods etc. 2. Staff were very cooperative and helpful  3. Rooms very clean and comfy  4. The have excellent Italian restaurant "
June 2019,Smiley and polite all around.Each time I walked in through the dorrs I felt like I was coming home.,"Room was atmospheric yet bright. Very comfortable. I love the view of the green square and trees. I love the desk at the window.  All the staff were incredibly polite and  friendly and ready to accomodate all requests, ranging from altering existing menu items to suit my dietary requirements to sending someone to help me weigh luggage to having something couriered for me.  Location is ideal- central yet quiet.  I love the decor."
July 2019,Amazing find in London,My 17 yr old son and I stayed at The Hari for our 3rd trip to London and it was fabulous. It was a home away from home. Staff was always friendly and helpful and directed us to the most wonderful places for dinner— sometimes going out to the street to  literally point us in the right direction. Amazing location without the noise  of London! We will definitely be back. I just saw a more recent review being upset at their room— this is a city so regular rooms are small like NYC but that should not deter you from having a fabulous time at The Hari! Hope to be back soon!!
July 2019,Absolutely Fabulous,"Tonight my friends and I had a lovely evening in il Pampero. Everything from our greeting at the door by Sophia, cocktails at the bar by Giampierro, three course meal with delicious Italian wine and the most amazing pastas, our evening was perfect. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for for a great place for a special occasion. Thank you."
June 2019,Fabulous hotel in a great location,"Just returned from my stay and everything was as advertised (maybe even better) staff was incredibly helpful and welcoming from the moment we arrived - the concierge Violetta could not have been more helpful. Our room was lovely - particularly the window seat overlooking the square! location was great - easy walk to Harrods, Harvey Nichols and other fine shopping. Located very close to 2 underground stops (Sloane Square and Knightsbridge) and easy walks to tourist attractions like Buckingham Palace and The Victoria and Albert Museum. The neighborhood is wonderful - full of great restaurants, pubs and coffee bars. Highly recommend - already planning my next visit."
June 2019,Perfect location!,Awesome helpful staff! Location in a quiet area of London yet close to all attractions. The bell staff were perfection. Concierge super helpful with suggestions and securing tickets for London attractions. 
July 2019,Just perfect!,This boutique hotel is very tastefully decorated and comfortable with a great location but it is the staff who truly make it extra special. Every member of the Hari team went out of their way to ensure a perfect stay!
June 2019,Style and warmth in a great location,"The Hari is a great option when in London.  The location is terrific, the staff is impeccable, and the boutique-style decor is modern and comfortable.  Wonderfully comfortable beds, sleek and functional bathrooms, and a central but quiet area."
June 2019,Outstanding visit,Amazing stay nothing was too much for the staff. Outstanding customer service particularly Vanessa from the bar. Attention to detail in not only the room but the whole hotel is second to none. Drinks on the terrace is a must along with the dough balls
June 2019,Great boutique hotel,"We stayed at The Hari after travelling from the Maldives (long journey!) and the location couldn't have been better! Situated right in the centre of London, the hotel itself was a great and short walk from most of the sights and top spots in the city.  The service was excellent - every bit of attention to detail was noted and well appreciated.  We did rate this 4/5 only because the nights we stayed this past week, the A/C didn't fully cool down our room at night. We would wake up throughout the night feeling very hot even though the A/C was on high and the lowest it would be. I guess this was an issue with the placement of the vents. One night, upon our return to the room, we noticed a small puddle of water below a access panel on the ceiling. The engineer came right away to fix…"
May 2019,little gem in Belgravia,"What a great find!  I made a late booking in June, so many of my London standbys were sold out.  I had never heard of The Hari, but it was available, and the reviews were great so I crossed my fingers in hopes that it would be ok.  And boy, I LOVED it.  From the moment I walked in, I was made to feel like a member of the family with warm welcomes from all the staff.   In my small but beautifully appointed room, were snacks and a bottle of wine, plus a welcome note.  (I don't drink so they brought me a bottle of mineral water instead). At that moment I thought, ""whatever snafus I might encounter, all is forgiven based on the awesome staff alone.'  But there were no snafus--my room had a sweet alcove overlooking the park, the bed was PERFECT, the room was silent, there was a tub…"
May 2019,Classy hotel,"We were picked up at Heathrow by an excellent driver organised by the hotel. Off to a good start. Chose this hotel due to close location for Chelsea Flower Show, stylish decor and great reviews. As with much of the surrounding area, the hotel entrance was beautifully decorated in flowers. From the moment we arrived till being waved off 5 days later, the staff couldn’t be more accommodating. My husband in a wheelchair was helped with a ramp for the steps at the entrance and in and out of taxis. The elevator is tight but doable. The female concierge always with a smile and helpful tip. We enjoyed breakfast each morning in the lovely restaurant. Other guests dressed very elegantly. In fact all guests we came across at any time were very elegantly dressed which was wonderful, but…"
May 2019,Belgravia’s hidden Beauty*,"A hotel with exceptional service, exceptional quality and luxurious rooms. Travelled here on my own for overnite stay before moving on to Cologne but this is the memory I wont forgot. They graciously accommodated a 6am very early check in after long flight from Australia. The room was immaculate and spacious. The bathroom a dream. I will be back in the future with my wife and three children when we are next in town. My chosen new “home” for London holidays and fun. Thank you Hari. BTW...the Italian restaurant was A1."
May 2019,Amazing stay,"We came for the weekend and we were welcome by an amazing team. Everything was very relaxing and easy, we loved the atmosphere. The bar and restaurant are fantastic. We wished we could have stayed longer !"
May 2019,Authentic Italian restaurant.,"I’ve been to the Hari for dinner at Il Pampero with my partner’s family. Let’s start by saying that the restaurant is absolutely lovely, very cozy and beautifully designed. The food is extremely tasty, very well presented and the service it’s one of the most attentive I’ve ever experienced; very recommended for a proper Italian meal in London. Can’t to wait to be back!"
May 2019,Favourite London hotel,"As an ex Londoner, I am very particular about where I stay when I come to visit. I love the location of The Hari: situated on one of the quieter side streets of Belgravia but within walking distance of Knightsbridge, Sloane Square, and South Kensington, it is perfectly located.  The hotel is extremely handsome, with beautiful urban decor which reminds me of some of the better boutique hotels in New York, and the rooms, whilst small, have a lovely comfortable feel without being stuffy (not a whiff of chintz here thankfully!) The service was impeccable, I stayed just under a week and was made to feel totally at home by everyone working here. I highly recommend the restaurant: whilst the Maitre D' is a little aloof, the food is delicious and the people watching is worth it."
May 2019,Simply The Best,We travel a lot worldwide and always strive for the best hotel experience. The Hari was recommended to us by a very experienced senior hotel executive who clearly knows his hotel business. We loved every moment of our brief stay. The staff couldn’t be more friendly and attentive. The accommodations were charming and comfortable. The food at the restaurant was superb. We will remain grateful for the experience and we will make The Hari our first choice of a hotel for all of our future visits to London. 
May 2019,Our Only Place to Stay in London,"This is our 3rd visit to The Hari and we love it here. It’s located in a quiet neighborhood but still walkable to major attractions, restaurants or underground stations. The staff is exceptionally friendly and always welcome you back inquiring about your day’s adventure. They gave us some great advice on how to get to one of the less visited attractions so that we would have good views of the city. The rooms are very nice with all the amenities you expect plus. We enjoy stopping in at the bar for a drink after a long day out. The breakfast buffet is very lovely. We didn’t eat dinner there (as we have our favorites in the area that we walk to) but I’ve heard that it’s the best Italian restaurant! "
April 2019,Mother’s Day Weekend Gone Bad,"I stayed here during Mother’s Day weekend. I selected the hotel based on reviews and 5 star hotel. So I expected exceptional service. I was surprised of how low the ceilings were however I will say do not order room service. The first night we were jet lagged so ordered room service. The hotel charges you for the serving tray to bring the food to you which converts to $5.72 USD each tray. I’ve never stayed at any 5-star hotel that does this. The next night I stayed at the hotel in the evening as my family went out. My family dropped something off at the hotel to take to front desk but the bell man said he would take upstairs. I heard one knock at the door and as I was getting out of bed to see who it was, my door was opened. It was the bell man. I’ve never stayed at a hotel…"
May 2019,The Hari is a must-stay in London!,"The Hari is a fantastic boutique property in Mayfair. It really feels like you're visiting a quiet, off the beaten path part of the city in a local neighbourhood. The rooms with the tub with the large windows makes for a unique view of the city."
April 2019,What a gem!,"The Hari delivers on all counts.  Perfect location for exploring London, delicious food at Il Pampero, very comfortable rooms -  ours had an amazing view over Chesham Place gardens - the friendliest and most helpful staff and .... it smells so good!!!!  The terrace is fabulous in all it’s floral glory and the lounge/bar area just the right place for an early evening Bellini!  Our only regret was not staying for longer.  We hope to be back again soon."
March 2019,"Gorgeous Hotel, Exceptional Service, Great Location","This hotel is simply stunning. It had a perfect mix of old-world charm and modern style. The restaurant is gorgeous and the food and drinks were sublime. The location makes it easy to explore London. However, what made our experience truly exceptional was the staff--they provided superlative service on par with hotels that are 2-3 times the price. While this hotel is not inexpensive, I felt that we got fantastic value for our dollar here. Would happily stay again and would highly recommend it to others. My only (tiny) issue is that the rooms don't have a lot of overhead lighting so when getting ready at night it was a bit dark in the room. During the day, the beautiful windows let in tons of natural light. Overall, an exceptional experience. "
March 2019,Lovely Boutique Hotel. Excellent Location. Outstanding Staff.,"This is an excellent hotel in a very nice neighborhood (Belgravia). We stayed in a nicely appointed king sized room for 2 nights, a break in our journey from California to North Africa.   For us, what set this hotel apart were the little things.   Right after we checked in, they had a complimentary pot of fresh coffee and hot milk delivered ASAP to the room. Very welcome after a long flight!  Also notable: they will deliver milk for the in-room coffee setup any time of day or night, free of charge. The day we left (early flight), we called at 5am and it was there in under 5 min.  The location is terrific. It's very easy to get Ubers or London cabs (often parked right in front). The West End and Soho are about 2-3 miles east, and Kensington is about 2 miles west, 15-20 min drive…"
March 2019,Excellent Hotel ,"Had a lovely stay with my daughter in a twin premium room. Great service, lovely large beds and beautiful bay window looking out onto the garden square below. Enjoyed our beautiful dinner and breakfast at ll Pampero. Looking forward to staying again in the future."
March 2019,Beautiful hotel with friendly and helpful staff,"On a Girl’s Trip, we stayed one night at The Hari as a side trip to our vacation to Paris. We were able to check in early which was a welcome opportunity as we were weary from travel.  Our room was elegant, clean,and spacious with a lovely view of the neighborhood from the comfy window seat. After a short nap, we walked the beautiful surrounding neighborhood and found great shopping on Beauchamp Place. We had a delicious Italian dinner at Il Pampero in the hotel and all of the staff were very understanding of our time constraints as were going to a play that night. The valet even had a cab waiting following our meal so we could get there on time.  Everyone at The Hari was wonderful, friendly and accommodating.  It is a hip, fashionable hotel without being austere or snobbish.  I…"
October 2018,I love this place!,"This is an amazing hotel. Excellent rooms, super comfy beds, and friendly and amenable staff.Whats more the location could not be better. One of my favourites. Not cheap - but this is Knightsbridge!  I was given a complementary bottle of champagne on my last visit - but I cannot recall why. Anyhow I was flying the following morning, so it is on ice awaiting my next visit.  Quite informal for a 5 star hotel, but that suits me perfectly. Bar and restaurant fabulous, very easy to strike up conversations with staff and other guests, just to make you feel more at home. "
February 2019,Two night stay,"Staff very efficient and friendly,  Rooms were very comfortable &!well equipped.  We dined in te restaurant & had a very nice meal . Again the staff were very attentive but discreet.  Had a most enjoyable stay"
February 2019,Very nice hotel,"A very pleasant hotel, just the right size, ideally located in a quiet part of Belgravia, yet 5 min walk to Knightsbridge. Staff very pleasant, food very good. You are welcomed with champagne. Highly recommended."
February 2019,Best of British,"We booked 2 rooms from Australia one evening.  The reception/booking staff were extremely obliging and helpful.  On arrival feeling tired from the trip, the doorman whisked our bags away and gave us a generous welcome.  This continued through to checkin.  As we had limited time in London we asked for directions to Harrods immediately which was literally minutes away.  When we returned after several hours the staff observed our tiredness.  Insisting on a cup of tea being sent to our rooms.   We were treated like royalty.  Being two 65+ yo women this is quite rare.  The rooms once we entered were luxurious, modern and warm both in temperature and ambience.  I would not hesitate in recommending The Hari to any form of visitor and would give it a 10+ for every aspect possible in a…"
February 2019,Mr,"Excellent service, excellent food, the bar is very cozy and nice, Italian restaurant is top quality and service, room is very very clean, spacious, also there is an Android portable device in the room with access to internet and a phone number that you can use during your stay . I will definitely stay in the hari during my next visit to london"
March 2019,Wonderful and cosy hotel in the perfect spot,"The Hari is an extremely cosy hotel with very friendly staff and nice rooms and great service. It is perfectly situated in a quiet spot and still right in the middle of everything with village-like Chelsea just around the corner, Satchi Gallery, Harrods, 15 min. walk to Mayfair and Marylebone, just around the corner from Hyde Park."
March 2019,Basically good but needs professional improvement,"Changed rooms three times for various reasons air-conditioning doesn’t work in one, Next one smells of smoke although  the hotel has no smoking policy. I must add that I found the staff to be extremely helpful when dealing with all the problems I think the problem is that it really is quite an old hotel which has changed names a couple of times and the infrastructure behind-the-scenes is pretty old.  One big plus is the  Italian restaurant, the food was superb far beyond my expectations and if you’re looking for a great Italian meal in London this is the place ."
March 2019,Fabulous Hotel,"I had a wonderful 2 night stay at The Hari. It is a superb hotel in a great location with extremely friendly staff, starting with the lovely Carlo who checked me in. The room was calm and tranquil with a lovely seating area under the window, an extremely comfortable bed and the bathroom had a true power shower. I drank in the bar which has a great vibe, with delicious drinks being prepared by barman Michael, and have in the past enjoyed an excellent meal in Il Pampero. I couldn’t recommend this hotel more highly."
October 2018,So Charming,"A boutique hotel in a lovely part of London, the Hari is quiet and plush. It all felt very decadent with the interior stylings of the lobby and the room itself, which had a big comfy bed and a luxurious bathroom. One thing to note is that there is a huge glass window from the bedroom into the bathroom with no blind etc to pull down, so you can literally see into the shower. Bit awkward when you are travelling with a friend, however the very attentive hotel staff arranged to have a curtain put up. We stayed for two nights and loved it!"
March 2019,Superior Hotel,"I was reluctant to review the Hari because I’m selfish and don’t want anyone to know how great it is but decided it would be a universal wrong to withhold this information.  It’s become difficult to parse out good and bad hotel options online, especially with social media framing.  Every property claims to have excellent amenities, be in “happening” neighborhood and have a luxurious finish-out.  I stayed over 2 stops, 6 nights total on a solo trip to London.  I’d like to move in there, but I have annoying obligations in the States.  Below, a rundown of why I love the Hari and why I’ll have to be back in London sooner than expected.  For starters, the staff were genuinely attentive and friendly.  Every person I interacted with seemed to be making sure I was enjoying myself and…"
March 2019,Great birthday weekend with friends,"Fabulous to be back at the Hari, with friends to celebrate a birthday... we had a full on weekend but it was great to return to the hotel bar at the end of the day for the vibes and ambience. its an Amazing location, so near Harrods and lots of boutiques, in a quiet area."
February 2019,Enjoyed our stay,We had a good feeling walking into the hotel and you could see the staff had been well selected and motivated. Room was clean and comfortable and we slept very well. There is a very relaxed feeling in the hotel and warm decor. My wife was very happy with the hotel and we will definitely use again.
February 2019,Family Birthday ,"Hi Just had an amazing weekend at The Hari, celebrating a family birthday.  Could not fault anything staff, rooms, food, location all five star and great.  Will definitely return. If you are looking for a great hotel in a great location you will not go wrong with booking your stay at The Hari Many thanks to all  KTx "
March 2018,Excellent,"A very nice and luxury hotel in Belgravia with a stunning friendly and supporting staff. Great rooms and first class breakfast. Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace and some very fine restaurants are just around the corner."
February 2019,Excellent rooms and excellent service,"Relliable good old fashioned British hospitality. The room service as well as the staff´s attention where always over the top, location is posh and so is everything they have to offer. Doesn´t let down your expectations"
February 2019,"Lovely hotel, excellent location ","We stayed in the Hari on a Saturday evening. The hotel location is perfect and we enjoyed excellent service, including drinks and snacks in the relaxed and luxurious bar. It is in walking distance to Harrods and the V&A. I had the best nights’ sleep I’d had in a long time and woke refreshed for heading on our holiday! Thank you Hari. - Dave and Helen"
November 2018,Tiny Room,"We thought that the location of the hotel was lovely.  It was surrounded by beautiful stores and still in a quiet neighborhood.  The rooms were absolutely tiny, however, for the price.  Yes, I do realize we were in Belgravia.  The hotel staff did accomodate us by removing the desk chair from the room so that midnight trips to the bathroom weren't toe removing!  The lobby and bar of the hotel are busy all times of day and night with business people and travelers enjoying a drink or having meetings.  This hotel was lovely and boutique, but probably just a little too tony for our taste!"
November 2018,The ideal hotel for a weekend in London,Absolutely loved my stay at The Hari Hotel. The staff was very helpful. Breakfast was very nice and the bedroom had a lovely view. Everything was perfect and I highly recommend the Hari for a lovely stay in London!
November 2018,so nice,i ve been several time in this hotel room perfect size is ok and equipment is good staff very kind wonderful place to move around close to victorian station (gatwick express) close to many restaurants and bars  perfect stay
November 2018,An amazing experience in a great location,"We spent three nights at The Hari at the beginning of a month long Europe/UK holiday. What an absolutely wonderful place to start!  Hotel prices in London have always been expensive but now seem to be truly eye-watering. It took us a while to decide where to stay and we were persuaded by the great reviews of The Hari. Although still expensive, The Hari offers so much value.   We booked a King Premium room which was located on the 8th floor. The room was not spacious but so well designed and appointed, every need was catered for. We had a lovely outlook over the surrounding skyline. The bed was large and comfortable. The bathroom was small but with one of the best showers we've ever experienced in any hotel - spacious, marble-lined, overhead rain shower! And large, fluffy white…"
October 2018,Excellent Customer Service,"Loved this hotel and would definitely stay here again and I recommend to others. It has a boutique feel and the welcome felt genuine as if the staff were really pleased to see us. We had a private dinner for 20 in their private dining room off the bar, I don't know if there are others. It is a bit snug for 20 people but the food was lovely. Rooms are well thought out and the bed comfy. Well placed for shopping and leisure."
October 2018,Weekend at The Hari,I stayed here to meet family in London. Everyone was very welcoming and helpful. The breakfast was delicious and the view from the room was panoramic and very attractive. I would certainly recommend this hotel to others wishing to visit this very pleasant area in central London.
July 2018,Amazing Birthday Experience,"My daughter chose this hotel to stay at for her 14th birthday overnight and theatre treat.  She researched throroughtly and made a fantastic choice.  We told them when booking that it was for her birthday and upon entering the room we discovered cake, balloons and a card signed by members of staff - such a lovely welcome.  We hadn't organised anything for the afternoon because we weren't sure when we would arrive.  We got to the hotel early in the afternoon and, on our request, they recommended a variety of afternoon tea options with some in-depth knowledge.  Concierge immediately booked us into the Berkely Hotel.  That is worth another review, it was just the right mix of relaxed and stunning!  Upon our return there were chocolate brownies and a bottle of Champagne (for the…"
October 2018,Amazing experience & customer service,"We stayed here for husbands birthday during the summer months and I can’t fault it. It is a stunning hotel, well located for Knightsbridge and the surrounding areas. We were upgraded upon arrival and champagne and chocolates greeted us in our room since we were celebrating. We shall definitely be returning to The Haro on our next visit to London. "
October 2018,Great Stay,"My daughter and I stayed for 4 days. The staff worked hard but quietly to ensure our time at the Hari was perfect in every way. They even ascertained it was my birthday and surprised me with a lovely bottle of wine and tray of sweets. Very nice touch. The Hari is well located but in the quiet Belgravia neighborhood where we felt quite safe walking in the evenings on our own. The rooms are lovely and well maintained as is the entire property. Our room was on an upper floor facing the green where we had a distant but distinct view of St Pauls. Heaven. This is a small, very well run boutique hotel. If that is your thing, then this is the place for you."
October 2018,Great stay,"Our stay at The Hari was great. Being our first trip to London, we didn't expect to spend too much time in the room. However, whenever we do travel, location is of utmost importance to us. The Hari is located in a great and safe area, but the walk to the nearest train stations aren't terrible, but it's not around the corner either. Rooms and bathrooms were clean, staff was very friendly and helpful. Cool story: My wife and I are expecting our first child, but didn't know the gender. We get a call from the ob 10minutes before we're supposed to board our flight saying that if we want to know, then call them back. We called back giving permission for the office to tell our friends. Our friends call The Hari asking if they'd be able to make a reveal cake for us. Our initial plan was…"
December 2018,Nice place,"Nice quiet street but still great location, nice restaurant in hotel and several more nearby. Small room as you would expect in London, very nice staff. Great bonus: you get a cell phone with free calls home and directions. "
February 2019,Upscale tiny suites in great location,"The hotel is a real boutique hotel, nice decor, lower ceiling for my tall husband. Location is lovely. Good bedding and amenties nothing special but nice The star of this hotel is the italian restaurant. a plus many italian well educated staff."
January 2019,"Stylish hotel, excellent service","A very stylish yet cosy luxury hotel, with many thoughtful touches to make guests feel welcome. The personnel is very attentive, friendly and efficient. The location is excellent, mid-way between Knightsbridge and Sloane Square, in one of the most elegant areas of London."
February 2019,Located 5-10 min walk from Sloane square,"Located 5-10 min walk from Sloane square. Making it easy to get to a wide variety of restaurants.  Staff very welcoming and friendly, and obvious but low-key security at reception.  The rooms are a good size, but the bathroom is very spacious.  There is a hotel restaurant and bar, that looked lovely, but we did not use it."
January 2019,Fantastic!,"The staff were so friendly and helpful, and very welcoming. The welcome drink was a real treat! The rooms are a great size and very comfortable. Great hotel bar and breakfast room. The hotel is in a great location as well. Would absolutely recommend this hotel. "
February 2019,An excellent hotel in every way,"This hotel is well situated, comfortable, has an amazing relaxing environment, its quirky décor is refreshing change to the larger chain hotels. All the staff were fantastic and could not have done any more to make our stay more enjoyable."
January 2019,Stay Here,"Walking distance to just about everything and if not, the tube is a five minute walk away. Hotel bar was inviting with great cocktails and no rush if you needed a place to unwind. The staff was really accommodating so much so that we decided to extend our trip an extra day because the concierge insisted we visit a Dior exhibit at the V&A that was totally sold out, but the hotel had some tickets for purchase. Everyone was so friendly, how refreshing coming form the states. The rooms were very cozy and the bathrooms are fit for some IG selfies. Do yourself a favor and stay at The Hari."
January 2019,Perfect birthday experience,"I stayed here with friends to celebrate my birthday and I couldn’t fault a thing.  The team were very friendly and always very happy to help. Special thanks to Joanna, James and Hannah!   The location was perfect and I hope to come back soon!  Thanks again!"
January 2019,Special London Hotel gem...,"My third visit to the Hari. I like this hotel because of it's location, general atmosphere and the very personal attention you receive from the wonderful staff. Nothing is too much trouble & for weary business travellers this is exactly what is required. Very nice rooms, cozy bar & excellent breakfast.  Well done team Hari.. Bradley (NZ)"
January 2019,Excellent hotel,"I stayed in The Hari in January 2019, the location couldnt be better, near Harvey Nichols,  the V&A, knightsbridge, convenient and accessible tube stations nearby. Also, close by Pavillion road which has been transformed. Very friendly and efficient team."
November 2018,Good Location,"The hotel was warm and friendly. This is by no means a large hotel, a comfortable boutique place, well located just behind Harvey Nichols and walking distance to Harrods. The rooms were quite small (we changed from the 1st we were given as it was right opposite the lift). Both were small with odd placed bathrooms. The 2 main nagging issues were that although there were 2 lifts, only one was ever operational. We also booked breakfast in bed. This was well below a 5 star standard. Everything was either over fried, under cooked or cold. We opted to have breakfast outside on our second morning"
October 2018,Amazing Place! High Class Hotel,"This was a wonderful stay! The Hari is a high-class hotel in a swanky part of London (Belgravia). The rooms are a little tight, but the staff more than makes up for this with their attentiveness to all of your needs. I would absolutely come back here."
November 2018,Fabulous hotel,"I have been to The Hari several times and it never disappoints.  I can highly recommend the bar and cigar terrace it’s got a great atmosphere and “A” listers seem to be regular visitors.  The private dining room is fabulously well appointed and the food equally as good as in the main restaurant. I have eaten in both a few times, one of the best Italian restaurants in the area if not in London.  Can’t wait to go back.  Carol DJ  "
November 2018,Perlefelt location,"During the years I have visited London many times. This time I wasn’t disappointed with the hotel. On the contrary this is the best hotel I have stayed In London. Perfect location, friendly staff and a great restaurant. If you stay at the Hari, I recommend you visit this Italian restaurant. Very good food and wine. A great barman as well as a great head waiter in Stefano. My compliments to Ivan at the front text as well. Minor complications when we checked in that was sorted amicably."
November 2018,Anniversary Stay,"We stayed at The Hari in celebration of an overnight trip into London for our anniversary, and it did not disappoint.  Upon arrival, we were asked if we were celebrating anything special to which we told staff about it being our anniversary. Once we’d been shown to a beautiful room with a view, we were surprised by a bottle of Moat and homemade macaroons and biscuits. The staff were all very friendly and attentive to our needs. The only things I’d mark The Hari down on are the fact we were told we’d receive a call to the room when a table became available in the bar, but we didn’t receive a call so just had to sit in our room and order a drink. The bed was also a little hard and had a lump in the middle of it, but other than that the decor and staff were amazing and we would…"
November 2018,Lovely hotel in the best part of London,"Great location near tube, Harrods, Hyde Park and Sloane Street shopping area. The rooms are nicely decorated and ok in size. The staff is very kind and helpful from entering the hotel to the front desk."
November 2018,Modern elegance with perfect location,Perfectly located short walking distance from Hyde Park and also Chelsea and Knightsbridge shopping areas. Quite modern and costly with young friendly staff. Rooms are modern and comfortable but donnit have a lot of light. Rooms in higher floors have a great view as well.
November 2018,Amazing response to tricky situation - exactly what you'd hope for from a top-end hotel,"There was a problem with my booking that was not the fault of the hotel. On arrival, there was no booking for me, and I was left facing having to find another hotel late afternoon, about an hour ahead of an important business meeting.  After some investigation by the hotel, I was offered a drink and spoken with by Matthew Burbidge-Airs, the deputy general manager.  He explained what had happened and that we had both been the victim of an IT glitch.  Matthew then offered to accomodate me in a room of my choice, with no further charge. I was stunned at the hotel's wonderful approach and the sheer professional of the staff.  The hotel is very well-appointed and close to Knightsbridge, Buckingham Palace and Westminster.  My room on the 8th floor had a wonderful view across the…"
November 2018,A Wonderful Find!,"I initially chose this hotel due to its location and the fact that they had rooms with two beds.  I was traveling with a good friend and we wanted our own beds.  The staff was top notch and the concierge helped us make and cancel dinner reservations.  Upon our arrival, our room was not yet ready but the staff offered us beverages and told us that our room would be available ASAP.  We chose to head out to the V&A instead.  The hotel stored our bags and texted when our room was ready.  Upon our return, we were provided with keys and informed that our bags were already in our room.  Wonderful service.  The bar staff was friendly and fun to chat with.  The location is perfect to Harrods, the Tube, Sloane Street (excellent shopping) and to the V&A, my favorite museum.  It's in more…"
November 2018,A Very Pleasant Stay,"The hotel is perfectly located on a quiet street. It is walking distant to Harrods, which was perfect for our last minute shopping and souvenirs. The bed was very comfortable. The breakfast included with the room was very good. The best part about our stay was the service. The staffs were amazingly attentive. Hats off to the team for the amazing work! We will definitely go back if we find ourselves in London again!"
October 2018,Wonderful,"We loved the room, the view, the breakfast... The staff were all so kind and helpful... Best stay of our lives, peaceful, quiet and romantic We recommend this beautiful hotel and will definetly be back soon ..."
October 2018,Perfect,Wonderful staff...great location..very cozy..higly recommend to all..only thing is I think they need harder beds but after all this a matter of selection of taste and need..I had also a friend who stayed also liked itThank u
October 2018,Best all round hotel in Knightsbridge,"Rooms are clean and modern, staff is very friendly and willing to help in restaurant reservations. Hotel also has an all day lounge for drinks and nibbles and of course one has to visit its amazing cigar lounge!"
October 2018,Short Leisure Travel trip to London,"The Hari in London is a fantastic hotel.  Amazing staff, decor, restaurant and location.   Italian restaurant is great, and the location, a 5 min walk to Harrods, is perfect. A perfect hotel that is in a good neighborhood and just far enough away from the hustle and bustle of one of Londons shopping districts."
October 2018,Fantastic 5 star bltel,"Stayed here for a couple of nights whilst I was in the area for business earlier this month. Quick check in, a lovely & helpful young lady checked me and made me feel very welcome. Very good sized room, with the bed lovely and clean. I didn’t eat at night here, but the breakfast was brilliant both days.  "
October 2018,Great Stay,Had a wonderful time at this hotel and was particularly impressed with the housekeeping. The staff was also very friendly and welcoming. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in London.
October 2018,Great experience,"The service and overall experience at The Hari were wonderful.  The staff went out of their way to take care of any needs and the rooms were spacious, beautiful and very clean.  Small touches like being addressed by name after the first day and homemade desserts at the front desk highlight their intention to make the whole trip wonderful.  The location was an easy walk to shopping, museums and multiple restaurant options.  We used the restaurant in the hotel for both a breakfast and a dinner, and would have gone back with the exception that we wanted to eat in different restaurants each night.  We would definitely go back to The Hari."
October 2018,Simply amazing stay. A+!!!,"Went for a 3 day family trip and I only have good words for the hotel and its staff. Incredible room, great views, amazing breakfast and dinner, super cozy crib + blanket for our 2 year old baby.  A+++!!"
October 2018,Great location,"Good, clean, friendly staff and a great location minutes away from all your main landmarks in London, the rooms size and service are excellent, expensive but that’s how it is in London highly recommend"
October 2018,Royal Parks Visit,Following a visit to the Royal Parks we went for lunch at the Hari. The restaurant is nicely decorated and has attentive staff with a pleasant discreet service. The food was exceptional we chose a selection of starters a selection of pastas and a selection of desserts which we all swapped and sampled each other’s all delicious. Highlight the hazelnut moose. If your in Kensington and Chelsea visit the Hari you will not be disappointed 
November 2017,The best service ever at a wonderful hotel and great location in London,"I recently spent 8 nights at the Hari for what was primarily a business trip. While I travel a lot, 8 nights in any hotel seems like a lot of time. But I happily could have spent even longer because of the wonderful service. The Hari itself is more a boutique hotel than anything, in a great part of London. It's an easy walk to the Victoria and Albert, Hyde Park, and even the National Gallery is only 1.5 miles away and a very pleasant walk in good weather. We were on the 4th floor facing a small park across the street and while we were on a busy street we heard nothing outside. The room was comfortable with a large window and sitting area and the hotel restaurant is very good. But it is the service which makes the Hari so special. From the moment you arrive you are made to feel…"
October 2018,Great hotel and first class experience (with added bonus of a good value),"Great hotel with friendly staff, adequate-sized rooms for a European hotel, a welcoming bar area, nice amenities, and a sophisticated feel. I don't know London incredibly well but the location felt like a balance between being enough removed to have some quiet if needed, but close enough to everything that you are still very much in the city. We loved it and would return.   Aside from a couple of caveats like the bar is a bit smokey from the cigar room nearby, and at the time we visited it was under a bit of construction, we had a fantastic time. Our only issue was making the mistake of taking the tube to the Stansted Express, which moved about as fast as a lazy cow. If you are going through Stansted, allow plenty of time to get there!"
October 2018,"Gorgeous Hotel, Quiet Location, Amazing Staff","We decided to end our UK trip by staying 5 nights at The Hari.  The hotel isn't huge, which is what drew us to stay here.    Location:  The location of this hotel was perfect for us.  A 10 min walk to Victoria station, which was nice and far enough away from being touristy.  It located in the middle of all of the Embassies.   The Hotel: Upon arrival, the door men insisted on taking our luggage for us, which was nice.  We got to the hotel very early and there wasn't a room for us yet, but they kept our luggage locked away until our room was ready.  We explored the hotel alittle and then left to grab some food.  We came back and our room was on the 6th floor overlooking the park.  It was perfect.  The room was clean and spacious.  We booked a Premium King Room. Super comfy bed,…"
October 2018,My london pad,We were greeted by name on arrival which amazes me when we hadn’t notified anyone of our time of arrival! Attentitive or what! The room was almost ready and we were offered drinks whilst we waited literally five minutes. This is suck a great location to Knightsbridge on the doorstep of Harrods ! 
September 2018,we came without a booking but still they accommodate us,"great restaurant we came announced but they gave us a table for one hours...good enough for us! food was fantastic, it is our third time there, service attentive but not too much. we definitely recommend this one. thanks for the table!!!"
September 2018,Great hotel,"Wonderful hotel, very welcoming and friendly, very generous too, i felt i was at home! The stuff speaks many languages, they are very helpful,and ready to fulfill any desire! I had a beautiful room with a great view!"
September 2018,Fantastic,"The best City Hotel I have ever stayed in a very, very long time. The service of the staff was top notch.  Perfect location with a short walk to the Underground (Victoria station or Knightsbridge Station).  Room was very clean and spacious (by London standards). Highly recommended."
September 2018,Home away from home,"Fantastic hotel, lovely cosy rooms, bed was so comfy and the staff were super friendly and helpful! I always stay at the jumeirah and in terms of service it’s incomparable! Stayed at The hari for 5days i enjoyed every bit of my stay, it really was a beautiful experience..."
September 2018,Outstanding experience ,"We cannot fault The Hari, from the moment we walked in to the moment we checked out it was simply fantastic. We arrived mid afternoon, got offered a complimentary glass of champagne which we enjoyed on the lovely sun terrace, got taken to our room to find that we had been given a free upgrade, and a beautiful birthday gift for my boyfriends 30th - Balloons, a bottle of Moët and some lovely brownies. The room was stunning, very clean and very elegant. We then carried our evening on evening to the Hawksmoors (a lovely steak restaurant around 15min wall from the hotel) then to the Royal Albert Hall which was only again around 15min from the hotel - excellent location! When we returned we found another!!!! Bottle of Moët from the hotel! We were so surprised we called to double check…"
September 2018,"""I like""","Located between numerous embassies in Belgravia just off the leafy Cadogan and Eaton squares, this small personable 5 star hotel delivers. Only a 10 minute walk from Knightsbridge and 20 to Victoria station. Very attentive personable service across the board: reception, concierge, etc. Modern rooms with good amenities, 24/7 well equipped gym, and great bar on mezzanine level round things out."
June 2018,W😍W - and then some,"Dear Reader - Dear fellow traveller,   Are you in urgent need of some highend - potent luxury and service on the Upper Level.   Then please do not cheat Yourself, The Hari located in the Prime area of London, can meet Your every desire, while placing Your well being higher then anything.!

In short terms this is a must try experience in London, the concierge and front desk etc., will assist You with whatever desire You might have and the pleasure is, this is in their nature.   Bon Voyage and do not miss Out 🙏🏻"
June 2018,Nice hotel but staff at check in was not very friendly,"When we arrived at the hotel, the person at the front desk asked for our name. Before we even had time to reply, we were told we would have to give a print of our credit card just in case we had some extras.  We filled in the paperwork, were given a key and were sent on our way. The receptionist did not engage with us and we did not feel welcomed at all. We just felt she wanted to get rid of us asap!  The room was nice, spacious and well appointed. The only downside was the scaffolding we could see from the lounge window. Let's say that if you want a room with a view, this is not the place for you. The bed was extremely comfy. One of the best bed I ever slept in. The next morning, another receptionist checked us out. She was a lot more friendly than her colleague which made a…"
June 2018,Best night out with my friends ,"Comfy bed and the best staff ever,notting is to much trouble...even a water bottle in the middle of the night. Dario and Bence was very nice to us even if they were very busy. Florina went over the top to arrange all of this for us. Thank you all for the best stay ever!"
March 2018,An excellent stay...,"I was warmly welcomed and excellently served by all the staff who were knowledgable and kind.  Comfortable and large bed, excellent shower and service.  Within walking distance of museums and Knightsbridge."
June 2018,Good Memory in London,"It was my first and important time to have my special occasion with The Hari in London. The staff are very professional and friendly and thanks them giving us wonderful memory. Decoration is fancy and modern. Location at a special area with a lot of iembassy, also is convenient to Victoria station or The Harrods. We really enjoy walking there.  Another surprise is the view of our room, we are able to look London Eye every night. Thanks for The Hari."
June 2018,Wonderful hotel in beautiful Belgravia,"The Hari hotel is a must if you are in London. For me my new Favorit hotel when in London.  The hotel is very charming and intimate. The staff makes the different to all other hotels out there. They are so welcoming and friendly and so engaging, they know all when its time to chat and when not. The attention to detail was truly amazing. I had a wonderful time in Belgravia, you feel there like you do live in London. It is very central you can walk to Victoria station in just 10 minutes. Overall I loved The Hari.  "
June 2018,Exceptional ,"Upon arrival I was met with the warmest of welcomes by the reception staff. I was  staying at this hotel on my birthday & was made to feel really special, nothing was to  much trouble, the room was really nice & everything you  could’ve wanted was there.  The restaurant was a lovely dining experience, the food & service was superb. I would recommend this hotel & will return.  All the staff are very friendly & helpful. "
June 2018,Best boutique hotel in london,I enjoyed my stay very much.Location is great.  The staff were super friendly and efficient. I booked studio suite that has a bath tub with a view. Room cleanliness was impeccable and in house restaurant is very good as well.
June 2018,Good value,"My wife and I were first timers at The Hari, and we were pleasantly surprised. The location, an eight minute walk to Sloan Square or Knightsbridge, is excellent. The hotel has a clean modern feel, but perhaps in their quest to provide homeliness , made the rooms a little dark. Our room, London small, was nevertheless very comfortable and the shower, well, the best shower in the UK! Service was excellent."
May 2018,Perfection!,"We closed out our recent Europe trip with a stay at the Hari and couldn’t have been more pleased. This hotel is truly 5 stars! Comfortable beds, smartly designed rooms and attentive staff. Interior design features in the lobby and first floor bar are impressive. Dessert treats with turn down service are an added delight. This is our new go-to London hotel!"
May 2018,Exceptional ,"I stayed at the Hari for 6 nights.  Everything was exceptional.  The hotel is clean, stylish, and the service and staff are next level.  Will definitely stay here whenever I return to London, moving forward. "
May 2018,Perfect weekend break,"This is a lovely hotel in a very nice location. All of the staff we came across were excellent, they were welcoming and they were always very courteous, pleased to help in any way they could. A credit to the hotel. We had a nice (quiet) ‘superior king’ room on the 9th floor, all the facilities you needed were there in the room. It was a decent size, with a good ensuite bathroom (with the most gorgeous Italian tiles!) Only had breakfast at the hotel once but there were lots of lovely fresh options, so would recommend to eat there. Definitely would make a return visit and would recommend to anyone thinking of traveling to London."
May 2018,"Stay here, you won’t regret it!!","Amazing trip, amazing place and amazing location. Couldn’t recommend it more!!  Thank you to the entire staff and the kindness you provided and service you gave.  You couldn’t ask for a better place to enjoy joke trip business or pleasure! "
May 2018,Excellent +++ stay,"I was visiting London with my 18 yo son to watch Hamilton musical.  We loved the location, very quiet Belgravia neighborhood (few (less than 10) minutes walk from the tube and buses).  The hotel is located in a quiet street overlooking a green small square.  The room we had was on the 7th floor overlooking the square, spacious and clean with very good rain shower and comfortable bed. Also a great sofa in kind of a closed small balcony! There were few small personal gestures that made our stay very warm and friendly.  Upon the arrival we got a welcome letter with few cookies and kind of London paint from sugar powder and when we returned to the room after watching Hamilton we found kind of a miniature of the theatre made from chocolate.  Each evening we got some sweets near our…"
April 2018,Recommend!,"We had a great experience staying at the Hari! The entire staff was super friendly and helpful. The bartenders, Michael, Victor and Eduardo, were excellent and gave great recommendations! The restaurant accommodated several special requests. Will return!"
May 2018,Too highly priced for such an average place!..,"This hotel is in Knightsbridge (or near it?) located on a very quiet square with nothing to do around it.  It claims to be 5 star (for whatever reason it was given the 5 stars difficult to tell??), but it is hardly a 4 star... (we have done 5 star and 4 star London hotels many more times before, so we know quite well what the standards are like).  The rooms are incredibly small and badly kept (except the bathrooms which were not too bad).  Walls are paper thin. You can hear everything that goes on in the narrow corridor. The elevator is tiny.  We did not try the breakfast?.. But we did try the Bar twice: it is full of 15 year old boys eating burgers and drinking coca cola until midnight.  No atmosphere at all... Overall there are much better options around the corner on Sloane…"
May 2018,Excellent smaller but vrry personal hotel,"Always a pleasure to stay at The Hari. Great location, walking distance to Kings Road/ Sloane Square and Knightsbridge shopping. For a boutique style hotel it offers all the necessary amenities including very efficient concierge, restaurant,gym etc with incredibly friendly and helpful staff. Rooms very comfortable and spotlessly clean. Well done to the hotel team. Look forward to my return."
May 2018,The best London hotel i've stayed in!,"Our stay was perfect from beginning to end, the staff went above and beyond to make our stay amazing. Michael is definetly the star of the hotel, the friendliest happiest person you will meet! Will not be our last visit!"
May 2018,Classy hotel with excellent service,"This was my first stay at the Hari and I was not disappointed.  I was warmly greeted upon my arrival by the fellows at the front door (sorry didn’t get their names) and then by Sabrine at the front desk.  My room on the seventh floor overlooked a small park across the street and was very comfortable with all the amenities you could want.  Upon my departure, the car for the airport was very prompt and waiting for us. All in all, a very enjoyable stay and will plan to return on my next visit to London."
April 2018,Lovely experience ,"Well well, I finally found an amazing place in London. Absolutely lovely experience and lovely staff. I had the gnocchi with zucca, taleggio and speck. A lovely signature tiramisù and an amazing cocktail. The staff, Anna, Dario and Zi, looked after me very well. I highly recommend the place if you are looking for properly Italian food and amazing cocktails. Definitely I will come back to try the other dishes from the menu."
May 2018,I decided to come back..,".. and was not disappointed.  First time i visited the hotel I had booked a King Suite which i found a bit dark.. so this time as I was travelling with a friend I booked a Twin Premium room. Excellent room with a lovely view.. and not dark at all.  The service from the door man, to the consignee.. is out standing. You really feel welcome.  The tiny outdoor terrace is quite nice.  The rooms are not big but they really work great.  You have all you need. Great amenities. Clean rooms! Nice mini bar.. you can hardly ask for more.  We did not try the breakfast nor the restaurant.  Will I come back.. yes.. already booked for next week ;o)"
April 2018,Extremely polite staff,"I was there a few days ago and found he staff very polite, compared to other places I have been. Atmosphere is nice and cozy. There is nice restaurant and food is tasty. Prices are pretty normal for that location and level of experience.  From my room there was a view to London Eye and the Shard, also there was a small cozy balcony, where you could go out and take a look at the city."
April 2018,Wonderful Stay!,"We were in London for my husband's 35th birthday, and headed to a Manchester United  game. The Hari was the perfect hotel for a relaxing vacation. As soon as we arrived we were warmly greeted and upgraded to a King Suite room overlooking the park. The room was bright and modern and even had a sitting nook! The hotel itself is very trendy and has a great bar upstairs with fantastic cocktails.All of the staff went out of their way to make us feel special and welcome. They even left us a bottle of champagne and wine on separate nights to celebrate the occasion.   I have been to London several time but never stayed in the area where the Hari is located, and i fell in love with London all over again. The area is similar to the upper east side in NYC; lovely townhomes, cozy cafes,…"
April 2018,"Lovely hotel, amazing staff","This hotel is amazing. Myself and my husband enjoyed our stay here. Unfortunately, I was very sick with a stomach bug so I didn’t get to enjoy the hotel as much as I would’ve liked, thankfully our room was really nice and cozy. My husband enjoyed the drinks and found the service at the bar great. There was also a large variety of books and magazines in the lobby to read.  Mostly good but there was a few negatives. I found the bed was a bit too hard. I love firm mattresses, but this was extremely firm. I found it very busy and noisy during certain periods of the day in our room because there was a lot of staff going in and out of the room next to ours which I found very odd. The terrace area was beautiful but people were smoking cigars out there and it was quite overwhelming.…"
April 2018,Amazing hotel !,Great hotel fantastic location and very friendly staff looking forward to my next stay ! Great views from the rooms excellent room service and a good Concierge team who are very professional would highly recommend. Adam.
April 2018,Superb location and sterling staff,We stayed at The Hari hotel in Belgravia last week. We cannot fault it. The staff were amazing and the bed was one of the comfiest we've ever had the pleasure of sleeping in.  They have a fantastic breakfast in the hotel restaurant and the bar isnt too shabby either. If you're looking for an 'all round' great place to stay in central london - look no further.
April 2018,OK...,Nice enough place. Not cheap. Used to be the Sheraton at one point. Had a facelift. All a bit meh.. location is not bad though it is v quiet if you seek action. High end residentially neighbourhood. Room was small and boxy.. NY style.. modern design and furnishings. Nice enough. Staff were friendly and pleasant. Just a bit like a high end Sheraton with a new coat of paint.. which it kind of is... 
April 2018,Best Hotel in London,"Have been staying at the Hari for years and it never fails to excell. Just stayed there for a week and it was like home away from home. We were remembered by staff from the moment we arrived and made to feel more than welcome. Our favorite room was waiting for us and we settled right in. Benjamin, the concierge, worked his magic and got us tickets to a brand new, sold out show and, over all, it could not have been better.   The Hari is the only place we stay while in London. Truly 5 star."
April 2018,"Amazing Hotel, Service and Location","The hotel is fantastic with a great vibe.  I was there for a business trip and received an upgrade to Junior suite with a wonderful view . The room is excellent and the staff just awesome. Someone is always there to not just greet you but have a non intrusive, nice short conversations, with you while you wait for a cab, walking to your room etc.  The front office teams and the boys at the front are amazing.  Location is perfect - walking distance to major shopping and good restaurants  My stay there was nothing short of exceptional in every way !"
April 2018,A true sample of excellent hospitality,"Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the staff , they were very helpful and friendly with great hospitality,The room was clean and comfy. Good location; very close to everything.Overall experience was awesome ,We will definitely choose this hotel when we return to London."
March 2018,Excellent Staff and Service,"I’ve stayed at this property 7-8 times and always a lovely experience.  The staff are very pleasant and helpful and the location is excellent if you like to be close to the parks.  The room is plenty spacious for a solo traveler.  It isn’t always easy traveling alone, but the staff make it easy to forget."
March 2018,First Class,"I visited The Hari last weekend.  I could not fault anything.  The service, breakfast, dinner, room and bar were all amazing.  Nothing was too much trouble for the very smartly dressed staff.  I will definitely be returning very soon."
March 2018,My night at The Hari,"The Hari is a hidden treasure in Belgravia. Once inside the discreet entrance it is stylish yet very comfortable with a welcoming bar and attentive staff. The restaurant il Pampero is like a little piece of Italy in the heart of London. All the staff are Italian and take pride in the food and the service. I had sea bass baked in salt, which was exquisite, with asparagus. The fresh pasta with squid ink was also delicious.  My room was stylish and luxurious. I chose to have room service for breakfast. When the tray came it could have fed a family! Fresh fruit, pastries, cheese - all beautifully presented. It was my first stay at The Hari but I would definitely recommend it. The staff were welcoming and genuinely made me feel at home."
March 2018,5 Star All The Way......,"What an amazing place! Every single member of staff makes you feel special as soon as you walk through the door. The customer service is impeccable, in fact the best I have ever come across in my travels. The hotel itself has a relaxed  cool vibe & is situated in a lovely area of London. I really can't wait for an excuse to head to London so we can stay here again! Thanks guys for looking after us so well. "
February 2018,AMAZING! Can't wait to go back,A truly 5* experience from start to finish. The hotel is filled with excellent staff who are happy to help at all times. We ate in the restaurant for dinner and would highly recommend. Throughout our stay we were made to feel like royalty. 100% will be staying again and would recommend to anyone. A piece of paradise in one of Londons nicest areas. 
March 2018,A fabulous new hotel in central London!  Hip hip 'Hari',"Oooh, what a find!  The Hari is discretely tucked away in Knightsbridge/Belgravia, yet walking distance (or a 5-minute taxi ride) to Sloane Square and Kings Road and Mayfair.  It is perfect for those wanting to easily visit and explore central London whilst having the luxury of distancing one's self from the hustle and bustle when the mood or occasion calls for it.  The Hari feels like your own private, fancy London pad, but as a hotel.  The furnishings and decorations feel luxurious, modern and cosy all at the same time.  Great bedrooms and spacious and well lit bathrooms.  The Italian restaurant is gorgeous too, serving up delicious foods and a great breakfast.  And if all of that doesn't yet convince you to stay at The Hari, the service will seal tje deal.  The chaps on the…"
February 2018,Amazing 2 day stay,"I don’t think I have ever stayed in a hotel as good as this. The location, facilities, rooms and overall accommodation are first class as you would expect from a hotel of this quality in Belgravia. I had a wonderful 2 nights of blissful sleep.  What really sets this place apart from the competition though is the staff and general level of service. Everyone is friendly and accommodating, and nothing is too much trouble.  Well done to this hotel you have managed to produce something special. I will be back in the near future, hopefully for pleasure and not Business next time!   "
March 2018,Amazing hotel and lovely staff,"We had a fabulous stay at The Hari hotel for my wife’s birthday weekend. I had notified the hotel earlier that is was her birthday and so on arrival to our room we were treated to lovely desserts and a sweet note from the front office manager. Their attention to detail is impeccable and we felt so very welcome throughout our stay. We dined at the hotel Italian restaurant Il Pampero, with us coming from the Mediterranean ourselves, we thought the food was lovely and exactly what we wanted after a long day traveling and sightseeing. All in all, great stay, perfect location and we can’t wait to be back."
February 2018,First Class in Belgravia!,"I travel extensively for work and look for hotels that not only offer me safe haven from the hustle and bustle but envelope me in an experience that has me wanting more. The Hari is one of the few hotels I’ve been where upon my arrival I felt both welcomed and delightfully overwhelmed by the hotel’s exquisite design, an extraordinary staff and all-encompassing sensory atmosphere of refinement and sophistication. Needless to say, it only got better when I entered my room with it’s stunning views of downtown London, impeccable decor and a bed to die-for. And lastly, The Hari’s restaurant (Il Pomero), lounge and gym were quite simply note-perfect! Thank you for a wonderful stay in London!"
March 2018,"Great hotel, Bad Managment","First of all, I have to say the staff was very friendly and they gave me a warm welcome and I really enjoyed my stay overall. My room was very clean and even though it didn't have a view it had a unique style which is the first time I've ever seen in a London hotel.  I tried the Italian restaurant which I have to say was excellent and very delicious but I realized that there was a huge price gap between the bar and the restaurant. The most expensive pasta in the restaurant is £25 while a normal white pasta in the bar is £35. It's unbelievable that the hotel management could change the price of any food in the bar to their liking. There weren't lots of selections of food to try in the bar. While I was waiting for my food to arrive at the bar and I noticed a rat coming out of the…"
March 2018,Perfect stay,"Beautiful room, lovely stay, everyone was very accommodating. Loved the fresh new design of the place and the location is superb, you don’t hear any traffic from your room. First time staying but for sure will return, great value "
January 2018,Birthday weekend getaway,"My partner & I recently stayed at the Hari for a weekend getaway for my birthday and I shall say straight away, that this hotel is of extremely high-quality. The Suite We stayed in the Studio King Suite on the 6th floor of the hotel which was suburb on every level. To start, it is worth mentioning the generous space of the room itself which was a very nice surprise (especially for a London Hotel) this factor really did make us both feel more comfortable and added to the sense of prestige. Everything in the room is incredibly well finished from the furnishings to the art, styling and décor; it effortlessly oozes class and luxury. I was amazed by the overall quality and feel of the room. The bed was very comfortable which enabled an excellent night’s sleep and added this, top of…"
March 2018,"Lovely Hotel, Brillant staff","We recently stayed at the Hari on a visit to London, On arrival we were greeted by extremely friendly and helpful staff.  The hotel is a boutique style and different to many London Hotels with a style all of it's own. The room was beautiful with a serene ambience and the bed was very comfortable, We had a complimentary bottle of bubbles in the room as well. A fabulous stay, highly recommended"
February 2018,Have a drink,"Amazing team, we had nice night with my friend over there. Professional and warm thank you to Vittorio and Michael.  And special big up for Edoardo cause his creations was amazing! Really talented !  Thanks to Juan to recommande us this place :)"
February 2018,"The Hari,best hotel in London!","Already at arrival the friendly staff welcomed us and proposed us a drink. The room was beautiful, contemporary decorated and very practical. The  location is great! The breakfast buffet was delicious and everything we ordered à la carte too! I highly recommend this hotel! "
January 2018,Fantastic hotel!,"I booked here on a recommendation and it did not disappoint! Upon arrival the staff were very welcoming and attentive. Our room had a fantastic view of the city (i would recommend asking for a top floor room) and it had all of the amenities you would expect for the price with a fantastic location near to a number of Tube stations and Harrods.    Breakfast was good too with a huge range of options. Breakfast staff were very friendly and provided good suggestions.   The one strange, and slightly negative experience, we had was one staff member seemingly 'watching' us for a number of minutes while we were sitting in the casual upstairs lounge after breakfast while my partner and I discussed our plans for the day. This staff member then proceeded to come up to us and ask our room…"
February 2018,Absolutely one of my favorite hotels in any city!,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Hari on my last trip to London - at the end of January. I had heard about the hotel from trusted friends so wasnt completely surprised at what I found. I travel quite a lot so I look for certain things - a comfortable and well appointed room;  a gracious and helpful staff; a good location; a fine dining option and a good vibe. I am pleased to say that the Hari has it all. Plus it has a really great bar/lounge that makes it an excellent place for relaxing or holding impromptu meetings with colleagues. I am so pleased that the Hari will now be my  ""go to"" hotel in London... and I am looking forward to my next visit in June."
June 2017,Perfect Location Very Good Staff and Product,"I spend 4 nights at this beautiful hotel. The hotel is located within a walking distance from the main attractions and it is a very nice walk.  Arriving at the hotel reflected it is nice and elegant look, starting from the doorman welcoming me, the concierge assisting me with my luggage to the receptionist who made a fast and efficient check-in.  The room looked beautiful and elegant with the right space and fit outs with a very nice bathroom and amenities. Comfortable bed and linens with excellent TV channel collection.  The food was very good and the response of the staff was excellent.  one comment that I have is, normally every hotel has a couple of complimentary water bottles but in my room there wasn't but I was given some very nice chocolates every evening.   Overall, a…"
February 2018,Great Experience in a Good Location,"Location:  Within the very affluent area of Belgravia (10 minute walk to Harrods). Nearest tube station is Knightsbridge Station (Piccadilly line) & Victoria Station (for the Gatwick Express / Victoria line), both stations within 10-12 minute walk away.  Hotel / Service:  Service here is exceptional. Checking in was good. A glass of sparkling wine and coffee was served upon our arrival at the room. The room itself was reasonably spacious and exudes class and luxury. Bathroom was well-appointed and toiletries are good quality. Housekeeping was very good.   Overall Experience:  Great experience and stay with reasonable room rates (compared to other 5 star hotels) - highly recommended in London."
February 2018,Boutique hotel with excellent service at all levels.,Well positioned hotel for Knightsbridge shopping and restaurants. Modern rooms with high spec fixtures. Electric Blackout blinds and comfortable beds leave you feeling fully rested. Breakfast in Il Pampero restaurant is varied and of extremely high quality - cooked and continental. DefInitely recommended.
January 2018,the disadvantage,"i am staying at the hari and overall i really liked the place it is comfortable. and actually what i liked more is the staff of the bar and specifically the manager “andreu” he is the best to deal with. the thing is i was shocked about the overpriced pastas that you have, i never did eat a pasta with this price and the problem is that the pasta is very normal nothings deserved the price that was nothing special with it. i thought if i am staying they will take care of me with the prices."
January 2018,Great hotel!,"The staff at The Hari Hotel were incredibly accommodating and extremely helpful.  Although the hotel was in a quiet neighborhood, it was in a central location with good access to public transportation, restaurants, shopping, and museums. "
June 2017,Great service.,"Would highly recommend the Hari. The interior is beautiful but what really makes the place special are the people working there. Friendly, sassy and professional with excellent attention to detail.  Really enjoyed my stay and look forward to returning. "
January 2018,belgravia boutique with cute furnishings and a great bar and terrace,"great location in the heart of belgravia, lovely rooms if a little small, may not suit all, great service, and super cozy and cool bar area with a cigar terrace to spend sunday afternoons - penthouse suite can be great fun"
January 2018,perfect location,"staying at the Hari was part of my 80th birthday celebrations, perfectly placed for our evening entertainment at the Royal Albert Hotel, and on the following day a visit to the V & A museum, The Queens Gallery etc. I have awarded this hotel and its staff a 100% rating for their facilities, welcome and hospitality, they were truly wonderful to myself and my wife and we cant thank them enough. Do we recommend them ? yes of course, and will we return, we certainly hope so, they will be the first we contact on our next trip to london, hopefully later this year. Thank you Hari we are still talking about you to our family and friends."
October 2017,They have the best bar assistant manager(Andrea),"I visit this place quite frequently, one of my favorite spots in london! Their lounge atomsphere is very chill and laid back. And their service is great, the reason i always visit back their place is their assistant bar manager andrea. He is very helpful and welcoming he always looks out for the customers and makes sure they are satified with everything and enjoying their time. I really like and recommend this place thanks to Andrea, and for whoever who goes there ask for him!"
January 2018,Affordable Luxury with Great Location,I was excited to go back to the Hari Hotel - even though its name changed from my stay a few years ago the Hotel and staff are as amazing as ever. You really cannot get a better hotel for this rate - from the moment you walk in to the hotel there is someone there to greet you and make sure you have everything for your stay. Little things like sending tea to my room upon check-in really make an impression in feeing like this is a home away from home. The street view from the room is gorgeous and the bathroom is very luxurious with some of the fluffiest towels I have had the pleasure to use. Although we were only there for a one night business trip I look forward to returning soon with my family for pleasure!
October 2017,NFL Games,"The Hari was amazing! The hotel was very modern and up to date! I enjoyed the mobile phone that was available for us to use throughout the city. Bikes were even available if we wanted to use them to get around the city! The rooms were a nice size, obviously smaller than US rooms but perfect and quaint. I definitely enjoyed my stay! "
January 2018,Excellent location,Stayed here for 2 nights on a businuss trip. Location near our office. Excellent service. Rooms to the street can be noisy. What they must improve is their coffee. Nice interior design. Friendly and attentive doormen.
January 2018,Just simply amazing for the second time!,"I was very excited to found out that me and my partner are going back to this amazing property. As expected, it did not disappoint us. In fact, it was even better! The moment we arrived at the hotel, their bellman and the receptionist greeted us with a warm smile. A couple of minutes after, Ms. Joanna showed up and guided us enthusiastically to the suite. Yes! This time we stayed at The Hari suite! My jaw just dropped and could not stop smiling up to my ears. It was just wonderful! I could say it’s one of the best suites that I have been to. There’s a fireplace and two balconies where we took some nice shots of the view using the Instax mini that they have provided free of charge to use. We captured special memories using this incredible gadget. Moreover, we also used the mobile…"
December 2017,Wonderful stay (again)!,"The Hari is an excellent hotel, with an unbeatable location and wonderful, warm staff - these are what I come back for time and time again. Everything went smoothly, and I have to give special mention to the front desk staff who had my room ready at 7am, when I checked in very early. It was great to be able to go straight to my room after a long flight, as opposed to waiting for the usual 3pm check in. Room service was faultless, both their breakfast and all-day options are great and a good go-to for those too tired or lazy to head out (although the hotel is very near great cafes around Belgravia & Chelsea, as well as Harrods and Harvey Nichols). As always, I am looking forward to my next visit! Thank you!"
December 2017,Great London location - dark room,"I visited the hotel for a long Christmas weekend with my 10 year old child.  We arrived at 15 o'clock to the hotel. and the room was ready at 15:30 so we waited in the lobby.  The staff was very friendly when we arrived and check in went well. I got a room at the 5th floor.   The room had a very small living room, a bedroom and a even small bathroom. The room in general is very nice and function ok. but it was small very small! We had a issue with one of the windows that could not close completely. which meant that the room was very cold. we reported it but it was not fixed during our stay nor did we receive any proposal from management to change room. not really nice when you have 3 days in the same room with a very cold 10 year kid. The room is very dark. that is ok if you…"
October 2017,Warm stay in the winter,This is the second time I’ve stayed in this hotel which I consider my home in London. The rooms are spacious and wooden floored which is the right thing to avoid allergies. The team is very warm always ready to fulfill all guests requests. I suggest this hotel to everyone who wants to be taken care and pampered.
December 2017,Welcoming stay - will return!,"It's not often that I stay at a hotel that exceeds my expectations, but The Hari definitely did. What I loved the most about this place were the members of staff - it's a cliche when people say ""they really couldn't do enough for me"" but in this case it totally applies. For example, when I needed a steam service rather than a press service for the delicate gowns that I had with me, they let me use the hotel's steamer (as the dry cleaner they use doesn't offer a steam service). The staff are extremely friendly and will do their best to help with any request, which is what you need when you're away from home.   The room was a tad small, but lovely (and typical size for London, really) - comfortable bed and a beautiful view over London from a little balcony. If I were to be picky…"
December 2017,Remarkable guest service,We arrived late night and were very disappointed with the room we booked..it is called kings suit however it was ridiculously small.. We hated the hotel and we seriously wer thinking of changing to a different hotel the next day. when we complained they promised to upgrade us the following morning. The next day we came back to the hotel to fund that all our stuff moved to a beautiful spacious room with amazing views. Throughout our stay the staff proved to be highly professional in addition to being super nice and sweet..starting with the doorman..reception..concierge..room service..etc.  Breakfast at the restaurant is excellent..especially the eggs Benedict and the pancakes. The beds are super comfy with high quality bedding. The bathroom was beautiful..it has a Jacuzzi with a…
November 2017,First class!,"We were given a warm welcome by the doorman and our check was very efficient but friendly. Our room was very cosy and was well equipped with everything needed for a relaxing stay. Bathrobes and slippers are also provided and some decent toiletries in the bathroom. We did try the bar which was great too! Friendly and knowledgeable barman who looked after us well.  Location is good too, for shopping and some good places to eat."
October 2017,Outstanding,"Thank you for a brilliant stay.  I will definitely be back.   Outstanding service, great attention to detail, delicious evening meal in the restaurant.     No request too much trouble.  A rate find.   Look forward to becoming a regular visitor "
November 2017,Stunning 5+star Boutique hotel,"Boutique hotels are all the rage. This is in a class all by itself from the moment you are greeted by Jack the door man. Our room was not yet ready since we arrived from Heathrow mid morning. Carlo on the front desk treated us to breakfast in the hotel""s restaurant bar....rich golden scrambled eggs and five star treatment by Elena. A smart phone was charged and ready to go in our room..invaluable when out in the city.  Room details perfect and sweet touch with gourmet chocolates at night. Ben the concierge handled the booking of our tours and gave invaluable advice for all our needs in London. We will definitely return!"
November 2017,Wonderful place,"We stayed at the Hari for a romantic couple and everything was so perfect, from the start with Jorge to help us with our bags under a heavy rain, everybody at the front desk was so nice and helpful and the concierge made our trip even better. I would definetly recommend The Hari to everybody who would want to have an pleasing, enjoyable moment in a wonderful place. Thanks a lot to everybody there"
November 2017,Terrific London hotel,"Stayed at the Hari for the first time earlier this month. Loved this place, friendly staff (even sent a free glass of wine up to my room), very cool room with great bed, awecome bathroom with a GREAT shower, multiple electric outlets (with US, UK and Euro plugs) and USB ports at the work surface, a nice little couch at the window with motorized shades, etc.   Good location in upscale area of Belgravia, very posh neighborhood."
February 2018,Perfection !,Fantastic stay with lots of personal touches and everything was perfect from the moment we arrived.   The food and drinks have been well thought out and served to a high standard with a prompt efficient service   The team are friendly and very welcoming   All the small touches made our stay perfect can’t wait to return 
November 2017,Exceptional!,"Service, and exceptional service at that costs nothing. The Hari have it spot on! From the moment we stepped into the hotel nothing was too much trouble. Every person we came into contact with could not have been more helpful. The handwritten note and homemade biscuits in our room was a thoughtful touch, and we will return.  Authentic and memorable? Absolutely!"
February 2018,Classic hotel,I like It's look like combination classic and modern Hotel because sofa all of hotel like combination Classic and Modern But Classic so so Many but Modern Not many like small yups i like it Combination so Great
February 2018,Perfect hotel,"Small luxurious hotel. The location is Very good. The staff is extremely nice. The rooms are modern, Very clean and cosy. With evrything you will ever need in them. Breakfast is very good.  Would certainly come back to this hotel.   "
January 2018,Overnight stay .,This was the third time we have stayed at the Hari Hotel.Staff are always pleasant and very friendly. Very comfortable and relaxing place to stay. Overnight stay to meet family who was staying as always at the Hari Hotel on business from Australia.
January 2018,Great Hotel and Staffs,We stayed around 1 week in January and we really enjoyed. The hotel is in a prime location. Walking distance to Harrods.  All staffs were extremely friendly and helpful.  The hotel interior was very nice. The room was comfortable. And we really liked our stay in this hotel. 
January 2018,Another great night,"My favourite hotel, friendly and so comfortable, stay here every time.  Had room service for a very early breakfast, bang on time, really good breakfast.  Reception always charming and welcoming.  Beds wonderful."
February 2018,Top notch and far superior to many 5* hotels in London,"My company travel policy recently changed from 5* to 4* hotels in London and I chose The Hari based on the reviews and score on TripAdvisor. Both the reviews and scores were spot on and well deserved.  The hotel is brilliantly located with Victoria, Sloane Square and Knightsbridge tube stations all an easy walk away. There are also some useful bus routes if like me you don't always want to take the tube. Good choice of restaurants and excellent shopping in the local neighbourhood too.  The rooms are compact but so well thought out and even though I stayed 7 nights with a lot of luggage, there was plenty of space to move around. Great shower and bathroom set up. Loved the wooden floor too.  Did not eat in the restaurant for dinner but the continental breakfast is plentiful and…"
January 2018,Incredible hotel throughout ,"Booked a 4 night stay. Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by the staff and were checked in an upgraded room. Larger than usual rooms (in London standards), very clean and tastefully designed. Shower/bath excellent. Hotel lobby, facilities and restaurant were spick and span.  Service was truly exceptional, attentive, fast and kind. Nothing about the staff felt fake or forced and they gave the kind of service which felt honest and made us feel at home. The neighborhood is just perfect. Quiet and calm but close enough to stroll around or, alternatively, comfortably commute via public transport around town. Great value for money. Highly recommended"
January 2018,The Greatest boutique hotels in London,Stayed with my family at The Hari for a week. The friendly and helpful team went above and beyond to make my wife’s birthday special. We travelled with our baby and for such a posh hotel they were extremely family friendly- from helping with the pushchair to recommending suitable restaurants. The hotel is ideally located and a few minutes away from most tourist sites in central London. The rooms are very comfortable and clean. Room service and front desk are responsive and attentive. Suitable for every type of Traveller. The Hari ticked all the boxes for me! 
November 2017,"Great staff, Great property, Great location",Thank you to Simona for everything. She always makes our stay unique. When we arrived she made sure we would have a list of nice bars and restaurants. Staff as a whole is very helpful. Great 5 Star hotel for people that wish to feel at home.
November 2017,"Fantastic hotel, fantastic staff","My wife and I stayed in the hotels last night for an overnight stay and dined in the restaurant. The service from each and every member of staff was flawless. The food competes with the very best Italian restaurants in London. The turbot was very special indeed and huge. The cocktail waiter is an artist!   This is one of the coolest and most comfortable hotels in London.   Thanks to the whole team there! Stephanie Butler, the welcome you laid on for us was very much appreciated. "
November 2017,Fabulous! Perfect! Friendly!,"This is absolutely PERFECT as far as hotels go and probably the friendliest staff I've ever encountered ANYWHERE! Just amazing folks!! Possibly my only gripe would be the room size (but I did take the cheapest room on offer, I didnt travel light and it IS London - so I possibly shouldn't be complaining!)  They've gone the extra mile - -Sweet goodies daily (that weren't repeated during my 5 day stay) -Rooms done twice a day -A mobile for use during your stay with internet -Early check in and late check out without any haggling involved -An umbrella in each room and then some at the entrance  -Staff that had me wishing I didn't have to leave!  I will be back.  ...in a heartbeat! "
November 2017,AB,"The Hari, Simply the best hotel in London. All the staff unbelievably friendly and helpful, no matter the request.  Ben the Concierge is a legend within the industry and can cater for any request for the out of town visitor. He even managed to persuade the chef to extend breakfast, not an easy task. Our room was perfect, clean and allowed for a relaxed nights sleep. Views over central London add to the pleasure. Great cocktails and excellent food, both in the restaurant and room service. I cannot fault this wonderful hotel and will stay there at the next possible opportunity.  All in all a ten out of ten experience. The staff are the core here and you can tell they enjoy looking after their guests. A refreshing change to some operators, hence this review. Enjoy "
November 2017,Great spot,"Wonderful friendly staff, polite, professional and considerate. Alex Cohen on the front desk was great.   Couldn’t have picked a better spot for a Solo bday trip (I got a happy bday champagne and brownies from the staff, along with a parting gift).  Cutest outdoor space on the 1st floor bar/lounge.  Highly recommended. "
November 2017,Good Position,"Nice staff on reception and a nice hotel in a great position between knightsbridge and Sloan Square. Easy for shopping, eating and museums. great beds very comfortable but the noise late in the evening when trying to sleep was a pain in the backside.   The hotel seems to attract a group of guys with great high powered cars who like to rev them up and drive around like nutters at 2am in the morning not great for any of the residents local or in the hotel. The hotel should do more to distance themselves from this group as it will cost them in the long run.  The breakfast was also only average nice staff but basic fair for a five star hotel."
November 2017,Impeccable little hotel in Belgravia,My husband always stays in this little gem and has always been very well looked after.  I stayed for one night and I was pleasantly surprised with their contemporary but warm and refined decoration and the kindness of the staff.  I am looking forward to staying here again.
November 2017,Wonderful,"The hotel is terrifically located, staff is extremely helpful and pleasant.  The rooms are super clean. The restaurant offers a nice breakfast.  This boutique hotel has a slick design.  I am a regular guest and never thought of changing it"
October 2017,Was a amazing night ,"I knew that if I wanna have a good night with a highly comfortable bed I have to go to Hari Hotel, it wasn’t cheap but worth every penny, they treat you as a king with their unique style and comfort you will have a great experience to remember forever "
November 2017,So Pleased I Settled on The Hari,"It's always a bit of a shot in the dark when booking a hotel.  I changed my mind a couple of times over the months that I was planning a stay in London and I was not disappointed that I finally settled on The Hari.  The hotel is in a beautiful area of London with easy walking to shops, restaurants and tube stations.  The staff were, without exception, excellent.  It never failed to amaze (and impress) me that the Concierge, Mr. Malpass, called me by name every time I walked through the lobby even though I hadn't taken advantage of his expertise...how does he do that!?!?  I would certainly recommend The Hari and hope to be able to return."
October 2017,Great hotel in London.,"We were in London for three days and the hotel exceeded our expectations.   It has excellent design, a great restaurant and superb location.   The concierge was very helpful as the whole staff.   It is a five minute walk from Harrods."
October 2017,Great service!,"I stayed a week in this great boutique hotel. It's a great hotel all around. But the service of the front desk team was superb (Thank you, Cesar!).   From check in to check out, the staff's service was above expectation — professionalism, friendliness, attention to details, knowledge about the area, great recommendations for activities etc.   The hotel is also located in a good location between Sloane Square and Hyde Park, Great places to walk or bike around."
October 2017,Excellent Hotel in every way,"We spent a long weekend in London at The Hari to celebrate my wife’s birthday.  Everything was great.  The staff is lovely and so accommodating. While I was making the reservation I ran into a snag and Nicole at the front desk called me in the states to sort it all out.  Once we got to The Hari all of the staff matched that level of helpfulness and we found a bottle of champagne chilling in our room.  We were in 904, which has a small balcony (I was able to fit a small chair on it!) and overlooks the park.  The bathroom is well outfitted with a shower/tub and a separate w/c.  The bed was wonderfully comfortable.  I do wish, as I find in many hotels, there were more drawers in which to unpack.  We got extra hangers and the problem was solved.  The hotel’s location in Belgrade’s,…"
October 2017,Lovely Boutique Hotel,"I had a wonderful 6-night stay at The Hari. They managed to meet my request for an early check in (at 9am) after a 14-hour overnight flight, which was a most lovely start to my stay. Throughout my stay, the room was kept very clean and neat, and i was most delighted with the daily packets of different types of sweets/candy/chocolates that were sent up each evening. The service is also warm and friendly, with all staff (from reception to cleaners) giving friendly greetings whenever we meet. I also loved the location, Knightsbridge, which is super convenient to get to anywhere. And being located in a rather quiet (but still conveniently located) neighbourhood, i could get quiet rest at night, without being disturbed by traffic noise or rowdy drunk people (which i've encountered…"
October 2017,"Beautiful hotel, nice staff but room disappointed","This is a beautiful hotel, with a great location, and a very friendly and helpful staff. However, my friend and I found the room a sub par experience. First of all, the lighting was way too dim. But the worst part was there was nowhere to easily dry and style our hair. I understand that you can't have an electrical outlet in the bathroom for a hair dryer. That's true most places in Europe. But most other hotels I've stayed in provide an area with a mirror and outlet where you can easily accomplish your daily routine. At Hari, we had to ask for an extension cord to plug the hair dryer in on the wall outside the bathroom so we could use the one wall mirror in the room across from the bathroom. It was very difficult to dry our hair. And I would prefer not to look at myself in a…"
October 2017,Form over Function,"I liked the overall feeling of the hotel - great design, very friendly and outgoing staff and wonderful location.  While the design was great, the function wasn't so great.  There wasn't enough space in the room for our things - I think that people who design hotel rooms should be asked to stay in them for a few nights!  I ended up using the window sill as a shelf/drawer. The bathroom also looked nice however the shower head was placed so that I couldn't stand under it without hitting the wall or the shelf with the shampoo.  And the lighting looked great but made it impossible to shave.  "
October 2017,Wonderful long weekend,"From the moment we arrived to our departure the service was second to none. Check in was seamless the room fabulous and the food exquisite. All the staff members where extremely knowledgeable,helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble for them . I celebrated my birthday that weekend, they provided a fabulous cake and the personal touches throughout the weekend where unexpected but very welcome. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and would not think twice about staying again."
September 2017,Outstanding Hotel | 6 Star Experience,"This is our second visit to this hotel, previously it was part of the Thompson Hotel Group. The Hari is an outstanding hotel located in the up-market suburb of Belgravia which is close to Knightsbridge. Our welcome back to the hotel was very impressive including a beautiful bottle of champagne. The rooms are modern, clean and well equipped. The beds are very comfortable and the turn-down service each evening was a lovely touch. All the staff made us feel very welcomed and nothing was too much trouble. If you are after a special hotel experience, you can’t look past the Hari. Thanks to the Front Desk, Conceirge, Doormen and Cleaning Staff for a another outstanding stay at this hotel. TG&DD"
September 2017,great London hotel in Belgravia,great London hotel with great staff and room. close to all shopping on Sloane st. free welcome drinks and coffee and very nice bar on the roof that you can smoke cigars which are not many in London. one of the best bedroom set up not seem in many European hotel in this level  
September 2017,"Beautiful hotel, first rate service","We stayed at the Hari for our first visit to London with our daughter and son-in-law.  All four of us agreed that the hotel was beautiful and the service was impeccable.  The front desk staff lept immediately into helping us solve a problem unrelated to them and the concierge service was exceptional, helping us make arrangements around town and even scoring a reservation for us at a one of the hottest 'full' restaurants on London.  We ate at the Hari's own restaurant 3 times for breakfast and twice for dinner.  Excellent! Can't say enough good things about the Hari.  A minor draw back is that the guest rooms are somewhat dimly lit but when we return to London, this is where we will stay."
June 2017,Another fabulous weekend break at The Hari,"We have previously had a fantastic stay at The Hari so decided it would be a good choice for our recent weekender and what a good choice it was. From the time we arrived we were made to feel special and we couldn't find fault with any member of staff we met. Everyone was cheerful, relaxed and friendly and anticipated our needs. Many hotels of this calibre can be aloof...not at the Hari, London. Our room was fantastic with a wonderful window seat overlooking the tree lined street. It was immaculate, very comfortable and quiet. The turn down service provided lovely sweet treats...top marks to housekeeping :) We had dinner in the hotel's Italian restaurant and again we had a great evening with good food, wine and service. Hopefully, we will soon return to the Hari for another…"
August 2017,Excellent weekend!,"Stylish and expensive hotel, very good location, friendly staff at the restaurant il Pampero: the Italian antipasto was nice, excellent coffee. Quiet room, great newspaper selection, disappointed by the staff at the reception!"
August 2017,Class,"Exceptional.   The Hari Hotel is located in an excellent location, away from the hustle and bustle but in the heart of Knightsbridge. Located close to great amenities (i.e. Harrods, Sloane Street, Hyde Park..etc).   The most exceptional part of the hotel are the staff. The staff are excellent and very friendly!   The rooms are stylish with lovely marble bathrooms.   Overall, the location was also key, very residential and quiet. Room was large, clean and extremely comfortable and most importantly the staff were great! We shall return.  Thanks."
September 2016,Amazing boutique hotel with the friendliest servicing team!  ,"Stayed in London for 3 days. A friend recommended this area and we picked the Hari. Best decision ever!   All of their staff are great, cannot be friendlier! Even guy at the Italian restaurant made me a coffee to go, when I asked to pay, he just said ""it's on the house, have a good day"". That coffee may not cost a lot, but the generosity and his heart to make my day is priceless!   Thank you The Hari! I'll definitely stay here again if I come to London.   "
July 2017,Stylish hotel,One of my favorites in London- simply because everyone working there is so friendly! The rooms are stylish with lovely marble bathrooms. What I do not like is that you can hear almost everything from neighbor rooms and the hall. The service is amazing! The staff is truly trying their best in order to make your stay memorable and pleasant.
July 2017,Excellent staff,The hotel was an enjoyable short walk from either Sloane square or Knightsbridge tube stations(very interesting to walk past the expensive properties with fancy sports cars outside). It overlooks a garden square and is in a quiet location. The staff are outstanding and it has a great atmosphere. Very comfortable bed. Slightly tired looking furniture e.g.  the windowseat but that didn't worry me as the bathroom was immaculate !
May 2017,A PERFECT TIME IN LONDON!,"The Hari Hotel really has its act together, and for such a stylish small hotel, it was pure perfection. The staff was truly outstanding, from front desk, doorman, and our waiter at breakfast remembering my cherished caffe latte! Location was also key, very residential and quiet. Room was large, clean and extremely comfortable. We shall return. Thank you everyone at The Hari, you made our trip to Wimbledon an amazing experience!!"
July 2017,"Cozy, Happy, and Comfotable","I have been to the Hari many times and have always loved it. I think that it is very cozy, comfortable and is definently worth the money. The staff is always kind and very helpful. When I go to London I will only stay at the Hari."
July 2017,The difference between fake and real,"You know how you can tell the difference between real service and fake service? Look at how service folk are when they're with one another and not with you. It's a treat to watch! But I'm getting ahead of myself - service here is extraordinary. So extraordinary that you take it for granted. I woke up late on the day after my last day of work. Had had a little too much to drink the previous night and staggered down for breakfast. Usual courteous service, take your time to work out what you want, would you like a coffee while you wait? A double macchiato? No problem. Changed your mind? Don't want breakfast, not a problem and of course we won't charge you for the coffee. And it wasn't just me - there was a fire in the building next door and one of the occupants of the apartment…"
June 2017,Excellent,"A perfect small hotel in delightful Belgravia. Staff was excellent & accommodating in every way. Rooms were clean, food delicious, and the staff was some of the finest I have encountered. Many thanks! Will return!"
August 2017,Excellent stay,"I have been coming to London for years and have stayed at a lot of hotels.  I would highly recommend this Hari  Great location, excellent service, great rooms, great vibe.  I'm staying here again next trip to London.   '"
July 2017,Great first impression!,"This review is a copy of the email that I sent to the hotel's General Manager after my stay:  I recently had the pleasure of staying a the Hari for a week while I was in London on a business trip.  I travel to London a few times a year and like to check out the different preferred hotels in our company’s program.  On past visits I’ve stayed at the St. James, Goring and Mondrian.  To be honest, I fell in love with the Mondrian earlier this year and thought it would be my default hotel for future visits.  Our office is at Canary Wharf so you can’t beat the location.   However, on my trip last month I stayed for 7 nights at the Hari.  I was intrigued by the extremely positive TripAdvisor reviews.    I don’t usually write an email to the General Manager after a stay but wanted to…"
September 2017,Magnificent Boutique Hotel in heart of London,"I have been coming to the Hari (formerly The Belgraves) for a few years now and absolutely love this intimate boutique hotel, which i clearly consider my home in London, and has been getting better and better. From the second I enter the beautiful, art filled lobby, every single staff member is polite, gracious and goes the distance to make me feel welcome and proactively respond to all my needs. Rooms are well sized, extremely conformable, stylish and it is very easy & intuitive to use everything. Bathrooms are specklessly clean and i must say i really enjoy the Noble Isle Bathroom amenities. Beside the bed there is a small portable Handy Phone with free local and international calls, internet and 3G for us to use throughout their stay, and this is really useful! The free Wifi…"
September 2017,An amazing Gem of a hotel in Knightsbridge ,"I stayed at The Hari for business. What a great stay I had. The welcome from the concierge at the door was warm and friendly and the two guys who checked me in really knew their stuff and were very polite and friendly.   Great room. Funky and cool with the most comfortable bed.   The restaurant rocked great food and drinks served by a trendy Barman and waiter.   Checking out today it was raining and cold so I was offered a warm coffee to go and then I was offered an umbrella but I said no as I wasn't returning and he said no problem you can take one, nice touch.   A really good stay and I would really recommend it for anyone visiting london for business or leisure. "
September 2017,"Fabulous welcome , fantastic hotel",Great location  great staff. Jack the bellman welcome us by out name!!! We where impresed  from the beggining!!! The receptionist was very nice aswell Charlie i belive. We where there  for my birthday and she knew and she  welcome me with happy birthday! The room was  clean and welcoming. We found a botlle of champagne and a good cake and in the plate was written  happy birthday!!! We went down  to the italian  restaurant where Giampiero seat us and made our evening excelent.   Thank you Hari team for everything.  I will stay again here for sure!!! 
September 2017,Beautiful and Mesmerizing,"I was first greeted by charlie, the beautiful woman at the counter after witnessing an authentic and lavish reception room. A perfect start to my hotel experience which i must say was wonderful. The rooms, the staff and most of all the service and food was exceptional. If i was lucky enough to have business in the area again i know who i will be booking my room with."
August 2017,Home away from Home,"The Hari is and will always be my preferred hotel in London. The location is excellent, the staffs are simply out of this world (Brilliant). It is our home away from home; even my 2 year old daughter acts as such. "
September 2017,Hotel experience,"The rooms are very stylish, but small. The shower door in our suite wasn't tight and after taking a shower we had lots of water on the floor. Bed was very comfortable, hotel is in the heart of London's best area. Nice restaurant downstairs. Staff is very friendly and helpful. "
August 2017,Would have liked more time,This was a 1 night stay and unfortunately we had little time to explore the hotel.  I found the hotel very pleasant a great room well  equipped  All the staff were very helpful.  Only minor issue was that the hotel was a bit warm for us
August 2017,The staff of the hotel is really treasure,The hotel rooms is nice and clean as any 5 stars hotel the location is one of top in London but the really treasure they have is the personal they work at the hotel I mean all the staff from the bell boy to house keepers and in between like the reception the room service and the people in nicely restaurant plus they have the best donuts you could have in London at the hotel cafe I enjoyed with my family all moments there and I Strongly recommend these hotel and will voting for hari to best hotel in London 2017
August 2017,Perfect in every way,"I booked this hotel for my boyfriends 21st birthday and it was the best present he said he could have asked for! I chose this hotel based on its location and great reviews and it didnt disappoint. From the minute we arrived we were made to feel so welcome and every member of staff we met was so friendly!  I mentioned it was my boyfriends birthday when bookingp and when we arrived there was a cake,champagne and balloons in the room...we were blown away with the effort they went to to make our stay special.  Everything was spotlessly clean and breakfast was superb.   Thank you, we will definitely be returning!"
August 2017,There is no words to describe how wonderful is the hotel,I advise everyone to stay at the Hari . this hotel is the best in Lonodn . I have stayed there many times during summer . since 2011  every summer I noticed that the hotel is improving and they have the best hospitality service to their guest .  The staff are amazing from the doorman to the Manager who welcome me back by sending a letter to my room with desert .
August 2017,Disappointed,"On arriving at the hotel the concierge and receptionist were very polite and helpful although our rooms were not ready, we were early, they took our bags and said they would phone when the room was ready. We had a missed call from the hotel at 16.06,We went off to explore and on return to the hotel around 5.30 a different receptionist was not very helpful and seemed confused over our booking. We got the keys for both rooms and the porter then fetched our bags we were surprised they had not been already taken up. On arrival in the rooms we discovered they weren't interconnecting which we had telephoned to check on earlier in the week and been told they would be connecting. The reception was not very helpful, and rambled on about only been told from booking. Com today at 2 that we…"
June 2017,Hidden gem in a fabulous location ,"Love this boutique hotel! I only got to stay one night as part of a business/leisure trip but wish I could have stayed longer.  The decor is very nice, the bedrooms are fairly small as is normal for London but they are well set out and spotless. The concierge knew I was going for a run the next morning and recommended a juice for when I got back. Sure enough, I returned and room service delivered the juice complimentary - fantastic personalised touch, thank you Ricardo!  The rest of the team were excellent and I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. The location is brilliant, within walking distance to Sloane Street, Harrods, Hyde Park and bus/tube.  I will definitely be back. "
August 2017,Fantastic Wimbledon Trip,"I recently stayed at The Hari for my trip to Wimbledon and did not know what to expect as I booked my whole trip including my hotel via a tour group.  I am accustomed to staying in mostly 5 star hotels and I will tell you The Hari hotel was amazing.  The service was exceptional - the concierge staff arranged everything from airport transfers to hair appointments and were very prompt in responding to all of my requests.  The doormen and bellmen were extremely polite and always provided me with directions to everything from a local hangout to a preferred jogging route.  The room service was excellent and always timely.  While I did not eat in the restaurant, I often had appetizers and drinks in the bar area and the service was outstanding.  The rooms were modern and very…"
August 2017,Amazing stay and great staff!,"I've stayed at The Hari in London already a couple of times on a business trip and I absolutely loved it!! The Staff go out of their way to ensure you have a fabulous stay at this hotel. From the greetings at the door (I believe it was Ricardo) to the welcome at the restaurant, the people at this hotel really make the difference. Elena and Gianni at the restaurant were tremendous hosts and they advised on a great risotto with seafood! Also the room was very charming and with a wonderful view. Last but not least, the cocktails at the bar were delicious. Alessandro is the master behind the bar and he knows his job really well (not only in terms of good drinks, but it is also a pleasure looking at his choreography when preparing it!). Thank you all for the great stay! See you next…"
August 2017,Great stay,Everything was perfect. Woul highly recommend everyone who comes to London to stay here.  The staffs attention  to detail is great.  Really good location if u want to be near everything.  Rooms were very nice inside
June 2017,Overnight stay for a birthday celebration.,"The Hari was an ideal choice for an overnight stay for a birthday celebration in London. The room we had was spacious, of an excellent standard and was very quiet and restful. This was complemented by a large, very comfortable bed.The modern bathroom was a good size and had quality complimentary toiletries. Like many other reviewers, the stand out feature of this hotel, for me, is the attentiveness of the staff. Nothing was too much trouble. From the moment you walk into the hotel everyone is there to help and ensure that you get the best possible experience - including members of the management team, who are often not visible in larger establishments. We had a most enjoyable stay and will definitely return."
August 2017,Enjoyable Stay at The Hari,The Staff at The Hari in London go out of their way to ensure you have a fabulous stay at this hotel.  You are greeted at the door by the smiling Doorman and walk into a spacious and appealing foyer.  At reception they will try their best to cater for your needs.  The room was clean and lovely.  The bed was comfy and restful.  The bathroom is not overly large but was clean with a large shower.   We had drinks at the bar and we were offered a antipasto plate complimentary with our drinks. It was delicious.  We did not dine at this hotel but found a gorgeous cafe for breakfast just down the road.  The location worked well for Us as it was just a little bit away from the main hustle & bustle. But walking distance to Harrods and lots of shopping. We would be happy to return to The…
August 2017,Excellent weekend night,"Had a wonderful time at the Hari ! I spent a night for a special night with my family and everything was perfect. The room was beautiful, the staff really kind and attentive. The emplacement is perfect, in the heart of Belgravia. This hotel is a really welcoming place that I will definitely recommend !!"
June 2017,Beyond Expectations,"Just returned from a fabulous 2 night stay at The Hari.  Having normally leaned towards the 'bigger brand' name hotel, this came as a complete surprise, and the level of service that we received was second to none.  From the concierge contacting us personally beforehand, a few days prior to arrival, to the late check out granted to us when departing- everything ran smoothly.  All staff that we encountered were superb!  At check in (where they greeted us by name before we even told them), to the incredible welcome gifts for my three year old daughter (and champagne for us) when we went to our room, these touches made the stay incredibly memorable for us, and we will be sure to return without a doubt.  The whole team there take an immense pride in their work which was reflected in…"
June 2017,Home Away From Home,"Staying at the Hari was like finding a ""new home""!!!  Everyone from the front doorman to the concierge (and everyone in between) was so inviting and welcoming and warm!  They went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed.....including a birthday celebration for my fiance!  Amazing place to stay.....you never want to leave!"
June 2017,Best hotel in London,"I looked both on airbnb and various hotel sites and kept coming back to the Hari, so I booked it. The hotel was roughly the same price as the airbnbs in the area. Having selected the latter last visit, we were so glad we had the opportunity to check out this fantastic boutique hotel. It was the best stay we've had in our many trips to London.   The service was amazing, all staff were so helpful and attentive.   The room was small but that's London. It was beautifully furnished. We had a cute little balcony with great views across London. The bed was super comfy and the room so quiet. The bathroom was marble and also very tasteful. It's going to be my  go to every time I visit London. "
June 2017,Pleasant stay at a pleasant place,"We did enjoy our stay from the very beginning to the very end. The ambiance of this place thrives on its stylish yet subtle interior design, on the room fragrances , the flower decor and modern paintings, and, most important, on the friendliness and extreme positive attitude of The Hari Team. We knew beforehand that the rooms were not very big, but their interior design is top (except: we do prefer showers to bath tubs). The location is perfect in Belgravia, a high level residential area, bus, tube and good restaurants are within tolerable walking distance, and Knightsbridge with Harrods, Harvey Nichols, other major department stores and high end fashion boutiques is a 15 mn walk away. If you are on the lookout for busier places South Kensington and Sloane Square are close. If…"
June 2017,"Excellent hotel in London, great location, amazing customer service! Highly recommended!","Lovely charming hotel, very well located (walking distance from Knightsbridge), excellent service. We have been warmly welcomed and, despite the late hours, we could still have dinner in the Italian restaurant (nice food!); room has the ""London"" sizes however the king size bed makes the difference. Rooms are equipped as in a 5stars hotel (you have everything you need for a short or long stay). It worth to underline the high level of service provided: the staff, and I really mean all of them, are amazing! Everything was simply perfect and they really made our stay memorable! Highly recommended."
June 2017,50th birthday ,"Just finished a weekend here for my wife and her twin sisters 50th birthday. We cannot fault this hotel in any. From the moment you arrive the experience is just perfect. There's none of the tourist nonsense with overdressed doormen or super trendy shoreditch posing with over trendy staff and ridiculously dark rooms.  The hotel is modern, the rooms large and clean, the beds super comfy, shower and bath amazing, food gorgeous but most of all the staff are friendly, polite and efficient. the best hotel experience  I've had in a very long time. "
June 2017,Highly recommended!,"We have just returned from my first ever visit to London and was fortunate enough to stay in a few of London's most famous hotels. We ended my London trip with The Hari and although we had not heard of this property previously we had heard and read some great reviews. Well, needless to say we were not disappointed! From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were simply pampered beyond belief. Our stay was curated by the wonderful Joanna who looked after our every need and desire. Our welcome amenities were thought-out and unique including the ever so delicious locally baked cronuts! Yummy! The room and furnishings were well designed and arranged and clearly every detail had be thought through. There were thoughtful surprises everywhere we turned in the room. The bath…"
June 2017,Choose Hari!,This hotel is a gem! The staff is amazing in a day they know you by name and make you feel like you are their most important customer.The location is excellent ;we walked to almost everything we wanted to see. I would stay there again in a heart beat. 
June 2017,The Hari Suite is Spectacular,"I travel frequently on business to London and some of the meetings can bring on unnecessary anxiety.  I arrived on a 6:30 morning flight, had to get ready at the airport to attend a 8:30 meeting in Mayfair.  The meeting was excruciatingly painful, but to my surprise, when I arrived to the Hotel Hari at about 6:30 pm I was greeted with a great surprise that I had been upgraded to the Hari Suite and the issues that I was having during the day, totally disappeared.  The Suite, designed by Tara Bernerd is an understated, comfortable sitting room and separate bedroom with powder room, free-standing bar, fireplace and small balconettes.  The coloration of the fabrics are a series of sophisticated jewel tones and luxurious velvets.  The master bathroom was generous and well appointed. …"
June 2017,Superb Stay ,This was first time we stayed at The Hari London and what a fantastic stay it was. The rooms are extremely well equipped and very comfortable. They have a great bar and terrace on the first floor. The staff are extremely helpful and make you feel right at home. Breakfast is also fantastic unlike many other other hotels in London.   The hotel is located in one of the nicest spots in London and walking distance to many London attractions. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anybody travelling on business or leisure. We will definitely be back.   
June 2017,Deserves its good ratings,"THe Hari Hotel deserves its good ratings.  Fabulous location, thoughtful and attentive staff, comfortable, well appointed and elegant room and on top of all that in our room was a cellular phone we were welcome to call home on and use all around London.   A very appreciated perk."
May 2017,Hari london,"This is my first time visiting London. The Hari London definitely made our stay very special. The glorious staff members are there to help. The service is very attentive from check in to check out. Every evening our room was turn down, I love to come back to a beautiful room after a long day of sightseeing.  The location is great; neighborhood is so quiet and safe. Very close to transportation. Definitely recommend to stay @ the Hari London "
June 2017,A gem of a hotel,"Located in a quiet neighborhood area of Belgravia, this great hotel is located between the Sloane Park & Knightsbridge station allowing you an easy walk to either line that connects to multiple major destinations around town. We chose to stay here to ease ourselves into London after a very long flight and are so glad we did! The hotel room was beautiful with fantastic views, the staff very accommodating and informative and the ambience charming. The rooms are very new and modern with great upgrades like US plugs already installed and the Handy phone - a wonderful gadget that gives travelers free local data for phone calls and maps - a lifeline to protect us from going into overage charges.  Tip: Ask for a higher floor for a great view of the city!"
June 2017,London retreat,"Great to be back at the Hair, very attentive staff, if was only a flying visit but managed a drink in the new ground floor bar, great atmosphere. Next time we will get to dine in the intalian restaurant menu looks fab! "
June 2017,Great stay at The Hari,"I really liked my stay at The Hari, the location is great and the staff is really very nice and welcoming. Loved the Hotel´s atmosphere and the comfortable room. The bikes that the Hotel offers free of charge enabled us to experience the city in the best way possible. Special note to the Hotel´s restaurant and Bar ""Il Pampero"" - Really good Italian food and a very friendly Italian (and Portuguese) staff. Will definitely return."
May 2017,"Amazing staff, beautiful stay, tasty food","I stayed for one night in the Hari in the Penthouse suite (I'll get onto the room later). The hotel, is modern, choc and fabulous, it has a laid-back luxury vibe that's certinaly not stuffy/snobby. The staff are so friendly an willing to help - Hattie and Stefano in partocular are so personable and easy to talk to. The staff really make the stay so comfortable and almost like a second home.   The restaurant is the perfect Italian restaurant . The setting is great, but the food is incredible. I've dined at a lot of 'posh' restaurants in London and I find it hard to find a great Italian but Il Pompero is that.   The room was to die for. Balconies with incredible views of London and the interior design was so fabulous.  I couldn't have asked for a better stay - the perfect place…"
June 2017,Excellent hotel and service,"This beautiful hotel is in a great location, within walking distance to Harrods and the Hyde Park. The area feels safe and even safe enough to get the hotel bikes and bike to Hyde Park. Fantastic way to see the park. The staff were all very attentive and professional but still personal. The hotel bar service was excellent. the room was small however had all the required fittings."
May 2017,Italian Food to Die For and Cocktails of Dreams,"Wow wow and wow this place is unreal and part of me does not want to let anyone else know about it. Cocktails of such creation, Italian food to die for and having an Italian partner I class myself as informed. The staff make you feel like family not a paying guest. In the words of Alessandro the best barman in London if you come to my house why would I not serve you the best drinks and prepare the best food. It's a must place and the best Cacio e Pepe outside of Roma."
June 2017,"Great location, wonderful staff!","I have stayed at The Hari hotel a couple of times, and each time has been a fantastic experience. They have great customer service - I have often requested to stay in the same room (high floor, with view of the garden outside), and the hotel has accomodated my request each time.   The location of the hotel is perfect - it is just minutes away from Harvey Nichols and Harrods. The hotel and rooms are also designed beautifully, and the bar/lounge area is great for meeting with friends and family. What remains outstanding however, is the staff. Warm, friendly and helpful.  This is the best hotel in London, and I look forward to coming back."
June 2017,Nice Hotel,"Nice hotel, Staff is very helpful and friendly. The hotel are in the heart of Belgravia, It's close to Sloane Square, Kings Rd and Brompton Rd. They have a small gym, nice restaurant. There are stable wirless internet access."
April 2017,Fantastic stay,We had a wonderful stay in The Hari and we booked another stay in that hotel for the end of the year. Fir us it is the best hitel in London and the staff is incredibely friendly . A very specual thanks to Joanna! 
April 2017,Extra- Ordinary,"An Unbelievable Hotel that ensures you are treated like a king or queen. Great location to public transport, shops and restaurants. All Staff ensure nothing is ever to difficult and want your stay to be perfect "
April 2017,Amazing hotel,"I recently stayed at the Hari while in London partly for business and partly to run the London Marathon. The service of the hotel was fantastic, the staff were so friendly and helpful and the location is excellent. The attention to customer service detail was spectacular - they made a good luck plate of biscuits in the shape of the finish line of the marathon on the desk the day before the race and a plate of chocolate dipped strawberries in the room after the race that had ""congratulations"" written in chocolate on the plate the day after together with a note offering 2 glasses of champagne in the bar. The rooms were a little small, but for a London hotel in such a top class location its worth it. The showers were amazing and the amenities where awesome. I loved every minute…"
April 2017,Even better than expected,"We didn't have any huge expectations of The Hari. It looked nice online and we ultimately chose it because we found a good rate and it's located in a quiet but convenient area in London.   We were delighted from arrival through check out. The hotel is chic. Our room was lovely, overlooking a little park with a window seating area. Though we are familiar with London and didn't need to many concierge-type services when we did ask questions they were incredibly helpful. The location is wonderful - a primarily residential/diplomatic area so its very quiet and relaxing. But it's also super convenient - close to two major tube stops and a short walk to Sloane Square.   Overall I would highly recommend The Hari and will definitely stay there on future visits to London."
April 2017,Lovely hotel,"I stayed at the Hari this week and the best thing about this hotel is the warm and welcoming staff. I had a red eye flight and they were nice enough to accommodate an early check in. The location is the second best part which is near a few tube stations and close to a grocery store if you forget anything along the way. I learned after the fact that if you want a room with a tub in it, you should ask which I will definitely keep in mind for next time. All in all- a great place to stay."
April 2017,London at its best,"What a fantastic hotel ! Great location, great rooms and even better service. The staff were amazing from arrival to departure, it felt like we had known them for years they were so friendly. Definitely be back."
April 2017,Easter Break,"A lovely couples weekend getaway over Easter, staying in the nicest of areas in West London.  Firstly the staff couldn't be more accommodating with any requests pre arrival. The hotel, room & facilities were fantastic and couldn't fault any part of the service."
April 2017,Frienly staff and perfect location,"From the first moment we entry hotel until we leave, staff was very friendly and helpful. Hotel now is very modern and confortable. Location also the best. If you go to London, don't hesitate to try, once you do, you'll repeat. thanks to all the team"
April 2017,Very nice location,Very nice location in Belgrave Square. Staff is very friendly and smiling . Very good hospiatlity. Nice bar and restaurant. Very quick services.. It was really wonderfull to stay in The Hari. I recommend the hotel especially for business trips.
April 2017,Excellent Hotel hotel in the best neighborhood,"Design hotel with great staff. Rooms are very quiet and furnished in style, although some parts need a little of renovation. The hotel has a stylish restaurant in which breakfast is served. The hotel has a terrace bar which is very nice. The only thing that misses is the Spa/massages"
May 2017,Flawless hospitality in a beautiful boutique setting,"I've stayed in more hotels than I'd like to admit. Usually my measure of a hotel is the bed, the breakfast, and the level of quiet. A rare measure of the quality of a hotel is what happens when someone makes a mistake.   In my case, a housekeeper accidentally discarded a button that had popped off a very fine pair of trousers from a shop in Mayfair. I knew I wouldn't be able to find the same button in NYC, because the store doesn't have an NYC outpost, but I also knew I couldn't spare the time to visit the shop. I explained the situation to the staff and they not only fetched the missing button from the store, but they also repaired the pants for me, and I've just returned to my room to find a lovely bottle of wine and a hand written apology card from Nicole, one of the Hari…"
May 2017,Perfect,"This is a great hotel. Well located, beautifully appointed. The staff are very friendly and were happy to assist us when required. I really couldn't fault this hotel in any way. Will definitely return."
February 2017,Great rooms and even greater service ,"The Hari was picked on a whim by my fiancé and I'm so glad he did so. Everything wonderful that you have read and heard about this hotel is true. I want to highlight a few points which were special for us. We got a free upgrade just because they had a bigger room available, after the first night.  One evening the hot water wasn't working for a few hours which frankly I don't notice. The reception sent us two drinks of our choice right and a letter saying breakfast was on the house the next morning. That was good enough but the GM also emailed us after we left to apologize about the water situation and offered us a great deal when we go back.  They used to have these delicious cookies at the reception and I'd grab a few every day. So the day were leaving I see a package with a…"
May 2017,"Amazing staff, great hotel, will keep coming back!","I booked The Hari for a business trip during the 9-12/2/17 without knowing that it was previously known as the Thompson Belgraves, which I had stayed in 2 years earlier (and loved it then as well). It was great to come back to a familiar, excellent hotel. Upon my arrival I was greeted with a refreshing cocktail and some sweets at the front desk, and as a returning customer I received a complimentary upgrade to my room.   My stay was very enjoyable, the hotel is centrally located a walking distance from major locations such as Harrods. On my last day at The Hari I went shopping with the missus and had inadvertently left my wallet on the counter at Harrods. Since I had already checked out of the hotel and rushed to the airport I figured I'd look for it thoroughly when I got back…"
May 2017,The Hari...taking sexy back.,"...a sexy chic hotel with extremely friendly and helpful staff...in a superb location to boot! Not a dream my friends ... This hotel reminds me of boutique hotels in Manhattan...a busy hive in the heart of Chelsea / Belgravia with a seriously rock chic vibe. Great decor, great colours, a bar on the first floor mezzanine ...a smokers haven on the top floor and a gym!? Sign me up! The restaurant has a healthy breakfast menu with mouthwatering choices....our room on the 8th floor had a panoramic view that I could  sit and stare at from the plush velour window seat all day long. The bathroom is huge...plenty of room for all make up pouches and the like...which believe me is not always the case.  Will we return? Darn tooting !! I loved everything about The Hari...have I stated that…"
May 2017,Amazing experience!!!,"Stayed here 2 weeks ago, great located, the hotel staff were all very attentive, great service, the decor is perfect in every detail, it's really magnificient! Highly recommended! WHAT A Gem!!! I would like to thank all the staff very much for making me spend a magical night! Over all expectations!!!"
May 2017,Happy customer! ,"Stayed here last night and I have to say from start to finish, the hotel staff were very attentive and certainly went out of their way to make the stay memorable. Stayed for my birthday and got a lovely delivery from the hotel accompanied by a sweet note. Concierge was very helpful pointing us in the direction of a very nice Indian/Pakistani restaurant close to the hotel. Room had beautiful view and was very well decorated. Would highly recommend The Hari and would definitely revisit if staying over in London again.  Thank you! :)"
May 2017,Fantastic hotel ,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 1 night stay at the Hari. The reception staff were very welcoming, warm and friendly and even arranged for Champagne and brownies to be delivered to our room on hearing it was our anniversary. Our room itself was beautiful, very spacious, luxurious and clean. We will definitely return. "
April 2017,A hidden diamond,"A Luxurious hotel over all expectations   Staid at this superb hotel with over the top staff. Greater located, for both shopping and sightseeing. All together a super experience, will come back next time visiting London.   "
May 2017,Brilliant Second Stay Reflects the First!,"This was our second stay at the Hari and it was like coming home.  The staff was more than helpful and attentive.  Our room was beautiful and the bed so comfortable we wanted to take it home.  Since our last visit the hotel has revamped their restaurant.  The menu was interesting and the meal delicious.  The same held true for the two room service meals we had.  Perhaps our favorite thing about the Hari is the location.  It is on a quiet street but is close to some of the best shopping in London, including Harrods.  And it is convenient to the rest of the city via The Tube."
April 2017,Excellent stay,"This was our first time in London and often when we travel we choose smaller boutique hotels which are normally known for great service without the crowds of a larger chain. The Hari is no exception to this. From check-in, the front doormen and housekeeping the friendliness and service has definitely met our expectations. There were some spotty treatment in their restaurant for breakfast but nothing to go out of our way to complain about. The bar on the other hand exceeded other bars that we tried in London. Kudos to the barman for being attentive and also going out of his way to make suggestions of where to eat in London. If we weren't staying at the hotel, the bar would've been worth the visit. Other than the service, the room was comfortable, have all the amenities you can…"
April 2017,Hooray for The Hari,"Took my 17 year old son to London for spring break and we spent 4 nights at The Hari. Could not have been more pleased with our stay.  London has no shortage of hotels. Even at the high end, unless one is booking a suite and money is no object, decent-sized rooms (especially with two beds) that aren't so precious that they are intimidating are in relatively short supply. The Hari offered the perfect solution. Room was good size and contemporary in design. Our room even had a small couch constructed as a window seat and a great bathroom with separate toilet and a shower with both a standard shower head and rainfall shower head. The neighborhood is lovely with Sloane Street and Harrods just a stone's throw away.  The room had plenty of connections for recharging iPhones, iPads,…"
April 2017,Classy and stylish with a warm human touch.,Excellent staff in every way. Always helpful kind and considerate. Went the extra mile to make us welcome and comfortable. Good rooms nice restaurant. Quiet yet conveniently situated in Belgravia. Good local coffee houses. 
April 2017,"Superb, chic, design and cozy hotel in a perfect location!!!","My husband and I visited The Hari on a 4 day Holiday during the Easter break in April 2017. We were greeted very warmly by the staff on our arrival. Our room was ready even though we'd flown in very early in the morning. With a great smile at reception, Pedro made sure we would have the best room available, without us even asking (the whole staff was lovely). We got room 209, a premium king room with a perfect view of the private garden across the quiet street. Absolutely perfect! Very well soundproofed room, with efficient blackout drapes. The pics you see on the hotel website for the room is accurate. Beautiful bathroom, and very nice water pressure in the shower. Very good air conditioning system in the room, worked well and not noisy (we like our rooms very cool). The staff…"
February 2017,Two night stay,Hotel was to a very high standard without being too stuffy! First impression was very good and reception was excellent.The rooms are too a high standard not too big not too small. Breakfast was again to a high standard with excellent staff on hand.We would certainly stay there again.
April 2017,Beautiful Rooms,"I really enjoyed my stay here and particularly loved our bedroom! We had an amazing, large window overlooking London with a sofa area built into the window so we could sit and watch the world go by. It was a great experience having breakfast in the window with the sunshine pouring in. The restaurant and bar provided delicious food and drinks, but the service was quite lacking. We spent ages in the restaurant trying to catch someone's eye on various occasions and had to remind staff what we'd asked for. But overall a lovely place to stay."
April 2017,Bar,"We had an amazing evening with our friends, the bar staff were polite, quick and knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great atmosphere and will recommend to friends and family. This hotel bar is great and going places. "
April 2017,All about the service and location,"Charming location with a great homey feel. Service and staff was exceptional. Rooms are slightly small for my liking but it would do for a quick stay or opt for a larger suite. Considering its location and the experience, it was great value for money."
April 2017,"Superb hotel, excellent location!","Very friendly and professional staff! Hotel ideally located near tube stops so getting around London and beyond is very easy. Quiet neighborhood near embassies. Close to great restaurants and shopping. And far from the tourist crush..this was especially nice after dealing with the madding crowd at the tourist hotspots. Room was spacious for London, and this is one of the few hotels which can accommodate 3 people comfortably and with privacy (private bedroom with king bed, and pull out sofa in separate sitting area). Linens and towels top-notch. Excellent food and bar. Exceptional concierge service will help you craft a memorable London experience. Yes, rick steves says to stay in a B&B, but this intimate hotel is a much better option. Stay here! You will love it!"
April 2017,Mrs Julia,"Lovely hotel, extremely friendly stuff, professional and polite. Rooms are small, but amazing, stylish, modern, beds are comfortable. Location is good. Harrods is in walking distance.  Loved the smoking bar :) Definitely coming back! :) "
March 2017,Very Good and suprising to my children,"It eas really a nice family friendly hotel,we stayed for 4 nights, staff at the reception is very friendly,also the staff in Il Pampero.Il pampero is an ıtalian restaurant in The Hari Hotel.Dinner menü is very good and tasty, only I except more on breakfast menu, cthet serve continental buffee, it was nice but once I stayed at ""The Mayfair Hotel"" and if ı compare both, The Mayfair's breakfasts were unforgetable, however, The Hari Hotel made out day especially my daughters.She is 9 years old and every time we left the room and comeback in the evening, she always found lovely suprises.once they took her toys and took their pictures create a story and put it in an album and left on the bed with a note thats written, 'just want you to know that your boys are well looked after when…"
March 2017,"Excellent hotel with nice rooms, great location and fantastic staff",I traveled with my 12 year old son. We both felt so welcome and the staff helped us with our questions and requests. Their care and service put a silver lining on our stay.  I highly recommend a stay at The Hari!
March 2017,"Beautiful, 5 Star stay, central location","The Hari is nothing short of 5 star, from the moment you arrive and greeted by the doormen, check in, and the rooms, everything was beyond expectations! These days it is hard to come by, this is why I stay at boutique hotels. We stayed here twice during our visit to London, both times for 5 nights, at the start and the end of our trip. Once on the 5th floor, then on the 8th. Both rooms fantastic, views on the 8th floor provided view of the London Eye and skyline.   Room: We upgraded to a Twin Premium room, fantastic size room with 2 extra large single beds, couch in window, mini bar, TV etc... with great size bathroom. The use of space was very welcoming, lots of mirrors as well. The room was lovely, fresh, clean, lots of light, large windows and wooden floors. Bed was very…"
March 2017,"Elegant, Cozy and Friendly","Love this hotel! Centrally located, wonderful, smart, interesting and interested staff, cozy room and super fast and kind room service (Thank you, Sabrine, you are the best! Promote her, guys!) plus great food in the restaurant, awesome concierge. I come to London lots, this is my second time at The Hari and I will be back next year. Thanks for a great trip, everyone!"
March 2017,Italian luxury in London,I cannot recommend The Hari London enough. From the complimentary glass of wine when I arrived to the room upgrade when I told them I was a sleep deprived Mama in search of respite and the general friendliness and warmth expressed by every single member of staff I came into contact with. The oxtail ravioli at the Hotel's Il Pampero restaurant were beautiful and the vege full English breakfast was fantastically filling. Bathtub is definitely big enough for two..my little legs couldn't reach the end so I was mostly trying not to drown 😁 But the marble luxury of the bathroom and Noble Isle products more than made the effort to stay afloat worthwhile!  Room was very clean and comfortable too. Free WiFi did disconnect quite a few times but was generally good.  Guest Relations…
March 2017,Excellence,"Have stayed at many wonderful hotels around the world, The Mercer in NYC, The Mandarin Oriental in London, Aman resorts etc, and this one is exceptional. Not just the hotel and its facilities, great rooms, excellent hotel restaurant and bar - but especially the staff. Every day of my 10 day stay staff were very kind and very cheery to deal with, and terrifically attentive."
March 2017,"Great hotel, friendly staff","Enjoyed our stay at the Hari. The staff were exceptionally good, couldn't do enough for you and made the stay feel personal. Great location, comfortable rooms. The only negative is that bar menu is expensive even for London prices. "
March 2017,my new favorite hotel in London,"a really great place to stay in one of Londons best areas and also more tranquil than being in the West End of London. Close to  Londons best shops, including Harrods and a wonderful selection of  restaurants to choose from or be advised by the very knowledgeable hotel staff."
March 2017,Exceptional,"I dont usually write reviews but i felt compelled to in this case, I treated my parents to a anniversary weekend and i booked the Hari based on the many positive reviews i had read. The whole experience and attention to detail and service is indeed exceptional, i have been lucky to stay in many 5* hotels but in the UK, the Hari surpasses them all, the informality combined with first class service from every member of staff is a credit to the hotel and reflects in the investment in the people who work there and nurtures a very relaxed, enjoyable experience for the residents. We were checked in by Renata, who symbolises the attention to detail and makes it all look effortless, she is engaging and friendly, once she discovered it was my parents birthday/anniversary weekend, she…"
March 2017,Back at my london home,Great to be back at The Hari such a great spot for shopping in Knightsbridge... the Italian recently opened in The Hair is a must! Not forgetting to start the day with the breakfast spoilt for choice on the English or vegetarian option both 👌
February 2017,Mr,"Would recommend. Fantastic food, and great decor. Staff very attentive. High quality feel.  Breakfast and restaurant 10/10.  Room (for the price) 8/10 Staff 10/10 Hotel quality and feel 10/10 Location 9/10 Value 9/10 ................"
January 2017,Cool Central London Hotel,"I've stayed at The Hari a couple of times recently and have been very impressed by the staff and hotel. The rooms are well appointed with good size seating areas, a decent TV and fantastic bathroom, both times with a great shower.  The location is ideal, close to Victoria and Knightsbridge tubes stations, about 10 minutes from each.  The staff were very professional, but friendly at the same time, it's a nice touch that they accompany you to your room after check in.  Overall a great place to stay and I'll definitely be staying again."
February 2017,Super friendly staff,My son and I spent 3 nights in the Hari and were welcomed in a pleasant way and very personal. Staff gave us good suggestions where to go and were to eat. The second day we returned to the hotel the end of the day and found nice pastry in the room modeled after the tower ( the Shard) we visited that day. Especially thanks to Anita and Alin our stay was very memorable.
August 2016,Above expectation,"Our stay was above expectation, well located, two good metro options, super attentive staff, suprise at Valentin's Day with our room decorated with rose petals, we would definitely return to The Hari."
February 2017,"Comfortable, beautiful and friendly","I have been to this hotel a few times and find it to be a home away from home. It is relaxed and has a beautiful interior.  The staff are so friendly, welcoming and accommodating it is a joy to visit. I love that we were given small bottles of water on arrival and every time we left the hotel.  The restaurant is also very nice and relaxed and you do not feel like you are eating in a hotel.  Looking forward to a return visit!"
February 2017,Exceptionally Amazing staff,"Perfect location, the most amazing staff always making you feel welcomed. Friendly atmosphere, making sure they assist you with anything possible. Rooms are nice, overall perfect place to stay business or pleasure trip. Bar/ terrace is located on 1st floor a place to unwind the day or evenings."
February 2017,"Excellent, comfortable stay","As soon as we walked into the Hari we felt welcome and comfortable. We were greeted by friendly staff who were helpful and smiling. After eating a delightful sweet from the front desk, we were guided to our room and left to relax in contentment and modest luxury. A great night sleep and superb service from the Hari staff through until we left. "
January 2017,Lovely hotel but bar is smoke ridden,A great experience overall. Friendly staff. Beautifully decorated. 5* experience. But the lobby and bar area just reeks of cigar smoke. There is a smoking terrace above the bar but on a Saturday night - the smoke and smell is just overwhelming if you're a non-smoker. 
February 2017,"Great value, extremely friendly & clean rooms","One of my best hotel experiences in my life and I have traveled a lot.. I don't think you will ever come by a friendlier and more genuine set of staff. Great team! We got upgraded to a bigger room on arrival, the design was great, rooms were clean and the location was perfect either as a newcomer to London or a more experienced visitor!"
February 2017,Unbelievable in every way! ,"From the moment we arrived, the Hari provided first class service. Friendly helpful staff and luxurious amenities in a great location really can't be beat! The Handy phone in our room was a great touch, it provided free internet service and local calling and was indispensable while touring London. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and the rain shower was unreal! We only wish we stayed at the Hari longer.    "
November 2016,The best 5 star hotel in london,"We booked the Hari as it looked much more up top date than the fussy traditional blue curtains and gold tie backs of the historic hotels.  It's didn't disappoint, but despite being incredibly fabulously interior wise, the service surpassed all expectations. Have stayed in many hotels and the service here is the best i have experienced. Notably we were offered a choice of rooms and where possible a complimentary upgrade. Equally we experienced complimentary drinks and extremely friendly good service.  Notably the concierge was able to arrange 2 or 3 of the top london restaraunts for us. One of the was Dinner by Heston and i meet people regularly who have been struggling to get a table.  Value wise- it was min better value than the historic or big names - this helped towards…"
January 2017,Fabulous service & great location &beautiful property,"The hotel is located in the heart of Belgravia, a quiet, filled with embassies area and it is a gem of a property, fully refurbished , with great design accents  and beautifully appointed rooms , decorated in calming colors, and flaunting superb materials. The rooms are on the small side, but it's understandable considering the type of building that hosts this hotel, and that minus is compensated by great amenities and an amazing location. Yet, the uniqueness of this property is given by its staff and service: welcoming, friendly, warm, professional, always with a smile and ready to offer their help, or a good advice. Our stay was one of our best hotel experiences , and we can't wait to go back. The bellman staff - ( Matias and Florin especially) - are the accolades that embrace…"
December 2016,Wonderful stay,"We had a lovely 1 night stay. The staff from the moment we walked in to the moment we left were wonderful. Room service breakfast was good, the bar on the first floor relaxing and the hotel is in a fantastic location. I would recommend this hotel and will stay again in the future"
December 2016,Superb!!! ,"Our staying in The Hari, was an excellent choice for our short vacation in London. Sloane Square metro station was a 10min walk and from there you could go everywhere in London. Belgravia is one of the nicest places in London, friendly, very quiet and we enjoyed walking through it. Outside the hotel there was always a cab, for those who didn't want to walk to the metro station. The room was spacious and modern decorated. The bed was so comfortable, that you didn't want to get out of it.  They provided us with a mobile phone,  where the city map was loaded and various tourist friendly applications. You could also use it for calling,  but unfortunately Greek numbers were not included. The staff was great,  very polite and kind.  Continental breakfast was included,  which was very…"
December 2016,Christmas Holiday," SUFFERING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A GOOD HOTEL AND AN EXCLUSIVE HOTEL As the end point of our Christmas holiday was one of the London airport, we decided to spend our last night at THE HARÍA-London Belgravia Hotel. Again, great decision. As an architect with many years of hotel construction experience, I never had the opportunity to take on the responsibility of building a Boutique Hotel. THE HARI is a great example to analyze and enjoy the difference between a good hotel and an exclusive hotel. I recommend those interested in sharing this concept to tray it. We coincidentally coincided at the time of check-in with the prestigious Spanish journalist ""Mr. Iñaki Gabilondo"" and it was a pleasure and a pride, to see the education, kindness and effectiveness with which was treated for…"
December 2016,Best experience amazing staff,"We arrived exactly at noon with our room waiting for us . Started organizing to leave to tour the city when we discovered an undetectable (by any standard) problem in the room (left under the bed by the previous tenants). The hotel staff was so friendly and apologetic, we where shortly upgraded to a junior suite until the end of our stay 5 days later. I would like to thank Anita and all staff members for an amazing stay, starting from the comfortable bed clean room great breakfast and amazingly over the top courtesy and willingness to help by everyone at the hotel.  Thank you for making this a memorable experience."
December 2016,Great Experience,"Although I have been a regular at this hotel over time, this is the first time I stayed when under owner-management. I am pleased to say that standards are as high as ever. Great location, great rooms & good food/drinks options. The stand-out though is the staff. A number of familiar faces. Always pleasant, always helpful. Expensive, but good things don't come cheap. Highly recommended."
December 2016,Stunning hotel with exemplary service,"We enjoyed a superb stay at the Hari.  The attention to detail and exemplary service standards were beautifully bundled up in a classy, modern and chic environment.  We particularly enjoyed sipping some amazing cocktails in the relaxed yet classy bar area.  The room offered a nice aspect and was meticulously clean.  All in all, a great hotel tucked away in a fantastic part of the City.  Thank you, see you soon."
December 2016,Service with smile - The Hari Hotel ,"Back in England after more than 10 years... I picked the hotel based on the reviews. We arrived early at 10.30am on the 23 Dec 2016. Dead tired after 18 hours flight. The weather was cold and by the time we reached the hotel we are just exhausted.   The girl at the reception was really cheerful and welcoming, I wished I remembered her name, all I remembered she planned to visit Asia in Jan 2017. She was helpful and tried to arrange for early checked in. She even offered us coffee tea while waiting for the room. Jack the concierge ever ready to serve us with the luggage, and within 10 mins we got our room. It was really a good start...  The place is cosy and artful. I bet every little things placed were done carefully. The room is not that big but it was cozy enough for us. All I…"
December 2016,Another great stay!,"The Hari is a fantastic place to stay. Great location (my fav in London, quiet, leafy and near Knightsbridge) with beautiful rooms. Stayed in both a suite and a deluxe room over the course of a couple of weeks in Dec, and have to recommend the suite. Impeccably furnished and surprisingly spacious for a hotel in London.   Have stayed here previously a couple of times, and every trip has been consistently great. Friendly, warm staff all made me and my sisters feel comfortable and welcome throughout the stay. Will definitely be back!! :)"
February 2017,Best Birthday!!!,I have staied in this beautifull hotel in order to celebrate my 30s Birthday. As soon as you enter the main Door you feel welcome as you would enter into  your House. Staff very attentive and a special thanks to  Ricardo and Daniel for taking care of my luggage and the guys at the restautant for attending me during my dinner.  Good size room facing the front with outstanding View. I will be back for my 31. 
January 2017,Great experience overall,"Cozy rooms with very comfy beds, linens, duvets and slippers! Staff is very friendly. Rooms always clean and tidy. The first floor lounge is a great place for daytime meetings and evening drinks, there is a cigar room as well."
February 2017,40th birthday in style ,"It was my third time visiting this hotel and my husband's first. We were celebrating his birthday with friends. The hotel is excellent.  The rooms are really well designed and have lovely marble bathrooms with every amenity you could need.   There is a really comfortable bar with great food. Unfortunately the restaurant was closed during this trip which was disappointing as you were limited with eating only in the bar however I am sure the new restaurant will be an excellent addition.   The location is excellent, the shops of Knightsbridge, king's road and Sloane street are just a short stroll and there are excellent restaurants within walking distance.   What will really make you want to return though is the staff. From the cleaners to the waitstaff to front desk and concierge…"
February 2017,It was certainly value for money.,"As mentioned, it was certainly value for money given location, size of the room, service of the staff (reception, lounge, doorman), lounge, smoking which belonged to the lounge. One main downside is the fact sound of people can be heard from the corridor of the floor. "
January 2017,Great experience!,"I stayed at The Hari with my mother for 3 nights before leaving London and I have to say I was not disappointed at all :)  We both had a great experience! The porters are very helpful, have to say I really appreciated as I had 4 suitcases which was not a problem at all! The front office team already knew that I really enjoy charcuterie and went beyond what was expected as we had a tasteful charcuterie board in our room! Breakfast is a Continental Buffet if it is included in your room rate! Simple but had everything I needed!   Really appreciate the handy phone in the room which is easy to use and charge, great if you do not have a British phone! The room was spacious and had everything we needed, including a tooth kit... great touch!  Thanks a lot to Charlie and Alex for the…"
February 2017,Awesome service,"Amongst the best service anywhere.  Beats most 5 star hotels. Friendly, helpful, creative, thoughtful, responsive.  Great location. Nicely designed modern rooms though as common for the area a bit small.  Very impressed "
February 2017,Perfect place in a perfect location,"The Hari hotel is a beautiful and intriguing place located in a heart of Belgravia. Walking distance from Harrods, just minutes away from the tube stations. Impeccable 24h service, 24 h room service and beautiful bar serving delicious breakfasts and small bites. Impressive cocktail list. Beautiful building, comfortable and spacious rooms, state of the art bathroom. I will never have to look for a place to stay while in London again, Hari stole my heart."
February 2017,Amazing experience ,"Me and my husband spent a long weekend at The  Hari and had the most amazing time here. This is our new favorite hotel by far. The hotel itself is very luxurious and beautifully decorated, the rooms are great with a lot thought put into the details and the beds are super comfortable. What makes this hotel really stand out though, is the genuine hospitality of the staff. Everyone from the doorman to the people at the front desk, to the bartenders and housekeepers are incredibly friendly, warm and welcoming. Best service we have ever encountered. Would highly recommend it and we can't wait to go back. "
February 2017,"The most thoughtful, generous service I've ever received","My fiance and I stayed at The Hari last night. I was surprising him for his birthday and in advance of our upcoming wedding. Jeanne at guest services was the kindest, most thoughtful host you could imagine. Not only did she upgrade our room, we arrived to find it decorated with dessert and a bottle of champagne. The next morning they remembered our story and even comped our small drinks bill from their downstairs bar. The whole staff was incredible, sweet, and personal. The room was chic, neat and quite sexy with interesting art and decor. I couldn't recommend this hotel enough for a stay in Central London."
January 2017,50 out of 10. Best of the Year,"I had the pleasure of staying at The Hari this week and it met my expectations in every way possible.  I was met with a friendly greeting by the door managers all the way through to the front desk, the warm charm of the hotel tastefully renovated complimented the genuine hospitality of the staff. I was very kindly upgraded to an executive room as i had arrived a little early but nothing was too much trouble. The staff provided helpful directions, an on time wake up call and a hot take away tea for the cab ride back to Heathrow. The bedding was first class comfort, and the view of the park and street was lovely. This is just 5 to 10 minutes walk to Buckingham Palace, Harrods and London Eye and many other attractions. This for me has been the find of the year and I will most…"
November 2016,Great Location,"We stayed at The Hari for one night as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, we have stayed at this hotel before a couple of years ago also for our anniversary and was so impressed we were looking forward to returning. The first thing to mention is that the staff here are excellent they are friendly, welcoming and eager to make your stay the best experience. Our room was very good spacious and very well kept in fact I would go as far as to say immaculate, the only thing We found strange was the lack of plugs within the room near mirrors made it a challenge to get ready in the evening for our night out. We used room service for a couple of items and they were very prompt and friendly which is always a bonus. The only reason I can not give the hotel an excellent rating was…"
November 2016,"Dedicated to chiara, Cristian ","I love them so much , They are the best And best service provided here  ❤️❤️❤️they should be promoted  Ps. Chiara is pretty damn cute She has the best heart  They are just the best ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Words can't describe how amazing this place is  "

November 2016,Excellent Hotel,Just spent a lovely couple of days at 'The Hari'.  It is an amazing hotel in a great location easy walk to the tube and there was always a cab available outside. There are also some really funky bicycles for the guests to use.  Breakfast was really nice I had a great omelette.  There is a lovely bar always very busy with a great vibrant atmosphere.  The bar staff are really friendly especially Luis. I will definitely return the next time I am up in London. If you do you won't be disappointed. 
November 2016,Lovely Boutique Hotel in a great location,Sadly stayed only one night at this cool hotel. Location is good; within walking distance of Harrods and Natural History Museum.  The rooms are well equipped and bed very comfortable.  The staff were all warm and welcoming and very helpful. We would have no hesitation choosing this hotel again.
November 2016,Excellent Experience,"Great location, warm friendly boutique hotel. Nice room, terrific location. The staff is what sets this hotel apart. From the moment we arrived we felt welcome and everyone made sure we were happy.  The concierge Diego responded to each of our requests with the perfect solution. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
November 2016,A great place to stay in London,"Excellent location and friendly, knowledgeable staff, the customer care is superb, down to even the doorman knowing who I was and that my daughter would be joining me later as it was her birthday! Such great attention to detail."
November 2016,Gorgeous boutique hotel,"Nice booking experience by phone...they honored the Trip advisor price, despite being unlikely to have that grade of room available on the evening. I was given an upgrade on arrival to a suite on the 10th floor. (1004).  The room was beautiful. Extremely clean and modern. Nice sofa area with real flame fireplace and bar area. Bathroom was marble with both a bath tub and rain shower. Lovely chain metal curtain to separate the bedroom from the bathroom...very chic. Great view of London skyline including the Shard, Gherkin and St Paul's.  As it was my husband's birthday they kindly left a chilled bottle of champers and a cake for him. Very much appreciated.  The corridors are dark and decked out with great interior design. It's a great place for a romantic hideaway. The bar is nice…"
November 2016,Family stayover,"We stayed at The Hari as a treat to my wife and boys at beginning of November. We booked the family suite with adjoining rooms and we bowled over by the quality of everything to do with the Hotel. The room was fabulous and luxurious in detail and furnishings with the added bonus of great views over London. Joanna from guest relations really took care of us from arrival and even laid on some great little touches for my boys inc popcorn and decorative doughnuts, and a bottle of champers for me and wife. We had our evening meal in main restaurant which again was excellent even catering for the children with their own menu. Breakfast was pretty special as well and overall we were taken care of by all the staff and will definitely be coming back."
November 2016,Top notch hotel,Third visit to this hotel tried 3 room sizes and we are impressed with all . Location is fantastic near to Knightsbridge and kings rd. restaurant and b ars reasonably priced and breakfast very good quality and good value. The main positive has to be customer service and staff from doorman to waitress and even the evening turn down service maid staff smile acknowledge you at all points of contact. So impressed we will stay here in preference every time.
November 2016,Amazing hotel and friendly staff,"I booked two rooms from Nov 4th - Nov 12th . I really enjoyed my stay , the staff were really helpful especially Ali and Semo. The Hari has perfect location 5 min walking to Harrods, and 12 min to oxford by the bus (bus #137) . Definitely i will stay at the hari in my next visit to london."
November 2016,"Beautiful, hip and perfectly located! ",They really take care of you here! Such a beautiful hotel and has everything you need! Most comfortable room and sleep. Simo worked at the door and was so sweet and helpful for us as well as the other staff! 
November 2016,Magic,Rooms are clean and very modern. This boutique hotel in the heart of London is offering the best service. Thank you especially to Simona for her tremendous efforts in making this stay unforgettable. See you soon!
November 2016,Great!,"The hotel is fabulous; the staff including Simo and Alex are amazing! Everyone was fantastic, the hotel restaurant is superb, and the rooms are very chic. Excellent all around. The concierge staff was very helpful organizing our days and helping us buy tickets in advance so we did not have to wait in long lines. Great location close to great restaurants and the tube. Many thanks to the staff for making our stay fantastic! "
October 2016,"Great location, good service, thin walls","All was gust great except for some noises that come from corridor (for example from someone closing a door) - if you sleep sensitively - consider this and ask for a room with less guests. Regarding staff - all super friendly, especially Simo working on the doors."
October 2016,A Truly Fantastic Experience,"From the moment I walked in the door to getting up to my room with a spectacular view this hotel provided amazing service and a spectacular holiday. There were a couple hiccups as with any hotel (the front door is automatic, but if there isn't a door man it will not always open and is exceptionally heavy), but overall I really truly recommend this hotel. They go the extra mile and it shows.   Oh and did I mention it is in Belgravia, arguably the most luxurious part of London by far."
October 2016,"Beautiful boutique hotel,Amazing staff.","This warm boutique hotel is very well located, not only for shopping since it’s very convenient for a refreshing run in hyde park. I was warmly received by a young staff and had a perfect house keeping in my room with lovely added extras each day. Breakfast is good and mostly the staff in charge,they were simply adorable,all of them. I definitely recommend the Hari !!!"
October 2016,Miss,"Excellent hotel and staff, very clean and good professional service. Breakfast was delicious. Interior is beautiful. In room massage therapist services were excellent and makeup for no hotel spa. Thank you simo for all your help & kindness it was a pleasure meeting you."
October 2016,Fabulous boutique hotel,Great part of town and a wonderful hotel.  I would highly recommend it.  Comfortable and quiet and close to so much fabulous shopping.    We didn't have breakfast or visit the bar area so I can't comment on that.  The room service however was delicious and timely.  
October 2016,Quality from start to end,Stayed in the hotel With a Group of 19 for two Nights. It is said that nothing is better that the weekest link. in this hotel there is no week links. Perfection from the doorman to the management......and still cosy
September 2016,Birthday weekend,"Lovely nights stay here for my birthday. Stayed in a studio suite and the room was amazing. Beautiful views, lovely decor. Our bathroom had a rainfall shower and a bath surrounded by a full view out the window. The bed was very comfy, amenities in the room were a lovely added extras.  Staff were amazing and extremely helpful. Only tiny thing I could say is we weren't advised of check out times or breakfast. Overall, a lovely stay and would recommend this hotel."
August 2016,The Hari,I have been coming to the Hari for a couple of years now and the place simply improves each time. The staff are great  and the rooms are fantastic. I am a regular visitor for business and leisure to London and would no longer contemplate any other hotel.
August 2016,Very nice hotel in a very nice part of London,"A very upmarket and well run hotel with friendly and efficient staff.  Everything is done and presented to a high standard and the price is about right for a premium part of London.  It's in the middle of Belgravia and about half way between Sloane Square and Knightsbridge, so close to Harrods etc, but best look elsewhere if you want something more budget friendly.  It's in a pretty quiet area so you are not disturbed by those fellas driving their noisy cars about to impress people."
July 2016,Central but peaceful,"I stayed at the Hari for two nights last week on business. The staff are fantastic and plenty of them! The finishing of the property is to a very high standard, every detail was perfect. The location is great as only 5 mins walk from Knightsbridge and the Kings Rd but still a peaceful location. I would definitely recommend the Hari to everyone! Good Job guys!"
November 2015,Little gem in the best part of the city,"We stayed at the Belgraves for a week from 24th-29th and we loved the modern room, the simply but sufficient facilities,  the  bar was superb!  We went to Mandarin Oriental Bar and also The Connaught bar after some recommendations and those places may have fancier presentations but the atmosphere, the Aircon and the service was far superior T the Belgrave.  I was told the hotel has been taken over by the owner of the  building branding it in his late father's name, I could see it on,y getting better.  Can't wait to go back!"" Bravo!!"
August 2016,Luxury boutique stay,"Great location, fabulous design and spacious rooms. We very much enjoyed our stay at Belgraves, the staff were very friendly and accomodating and the continental breakfast was wonderful, with fresh bread, fruit, cheeses and charcuterie. Many thanks to the reception staff for letting us check in early!"
August 2016,Birthday trip,"Everything was perfect!  The hotel is a real gem hidden in London. Close to Hyde park, Harold's and the luxurious Sloane street. The concierge, Violet, helped us with everything and made our trip amazing!"
August 2016,Perfect and the bed was amazing ,"The Belgraves met our expectations on every level.  Pre arrival messages letting us know that we could checkin early, massive welcome from reception and concierge team on arrival and stunning accommodation.  Location is perfect for central London and the real village that is Belgravia.  If your visiting the numerous embassies in the area, you're looking for world class shopping or just want to see the major sights of London then this hotel is for you.  We've been on the road for over two weeks and the bed in this hotel was the best we experienced.  Thanks for looking after us and making us feel so welcome."
August 2016,Excellent hotel,"Excellent location  , the size of the room is very good ,the hotel is very clean and very save.  Staff are friendly and will assist you with smile. The only reservation I have,the hotel have to improve the food that they provide for the breakfast.  "
July 2016,Belgraves is the top hotel in London,"I recommend everyone to stay at Belgraves and I am sure that you will have a great staying >  The bed is very comforbale , room is clean and quit   staff is wonderful , always they are doing their best to make the guest happy .  location of hotel is located at classy area and little bit far from the station "" 12 minutes wake ""    the only thing I don't like is the food of the hotel . my room have a complementary breakfast but unfortunately they don't have a wide variety of food   "
October 2016,"Drinks with friends, important business meetings, food served all day - this hotel covers all your needs","Whether you're looking for a great place to grab a drink with friends, unwind after a long day of work, grab a bite to eat, or conduct an important business meeting, Belgraves Hotel meets all your needs.  The ambience is contemporary, the service is stellar and the outdoor space is a welcomed bonus."
October 2016,Honeymooning in London,The staff was super friendly and helpful.  They made us feel like royalty. An amazing experience from start to finish.  We would highly recommend this hotel in the wealthy Belgravia section of London and would absolutely return in the future. 
October 2016,Amazing getaway,"We had an amazing time at the Hari Hotel. Localised in the center of London, next to Harrods, everything was ""à portée de main"", realy easy . We had a special attention thanks to our couple of friend that we were joining for the Week end. Champagne et truffle chocolate. The room was decorated with taste, elegance , cotemporary design with nice piece of furniture, opening on a amazing view on The City. Extremelly well fitted with everything you will need during your stay. If you are travelling to London, you can Not pass without spending a night or even more at the Hari Hôtel.  We only wish we can have stay longer."
October 2016,"Excellent, highly recommended","Nowadays it is far from normal to get the a good, professional service when purchasing good and services but I have to say 'The Hari' really delivered, they are professional and friendly, they went out of their was to make sure our stay was memorable.  Their attention to detail is second to none and I would recommend staying here over anywhere I have stayed in the UK.  The position of the hotel is set for all your shopping and evening entertainment needs.  Dave"
October 2016,Smart Hotel - Good location ,Stayed here after a recommendation from a friend. A nice boutique hotel just 5 minutes walk from Harrods. Staff are very helpful and the rooms are very nice. Paid around £220 for the room (Saturday night) including breakfast on short notice which for me was good. Would definitely stay here again
October 2016,Love this hotel,"Fab hotel for shopping in Knightsbridge/West End, the service is excellent, the staff are the best, so accommodating. We were celebrating my daughter's birthday and they made it extra special. Very cool hotel and bar. "
October 2016,The best hotel in London!,The nicest guest experience we have ever had! We had the best welcome from the FOM Alex Cohen and the events manager Marie Froger who literallly spoiled us with a lovely room. Although it was more than enough they took the time to prepare a special amenity with a picture of my husband and I with some nice chocolate truffles and Champagne! The best part is that the picture was edible! Incredible! We never experienced such a special attention and had the best time in London with our friends. Our favorite part is that you can borrow the Handy phone from your room to carry a smartphone with you. Every single part of this hotel is amazing and we would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to have the best getaway in London!
September 2016,My new favourite place in London! ,"I was staying at the Hari hotel for 4 nights and it was just perfect! The location, the bar always busy, the smoking terrace with the nice lanterns and the green plants on the walls, the decoration of the hotel and the room is very cosy, it is 10/10! About the staff they were all very nice and helpfull, at the front desk, the waiters, the housekeeping ladies, the porters such as Simo who was really amazing! Speaking so many languages, always smiling and at your service to help anytime you need! I just felt like I was at home and I didn't even want to leave :) I highly recommand this place! "
October 2016,Great location,"We selected the Hari because of its location and since we were travelling with a toddler, a decent onsite restaurant and bar. We weren't disappointed at all.  The Hari is a healthy walk away from many key sightseeing spots but also extremely convenient for cabs / uber.  The restaurant was perfect for us with healthy options for kids and adults.  The bar was nice but priced for the neighbourhood!  Our room was comfortable, clean, quiet, modern and stylish with all necessary conveniences. Being central London, space was a little tight though.  Service was professional and the door staff were helpful and welcoming."
October 2016,Perfect stay ,"An excellent hotel. The staff could not do enough for us and were attentive and helpful. The continental breakfast was lovely, and everywhere spotless. It was my wife's birthday, and the staff picked up on this and left a cake, a card and a bottle of champagne in the room. Cocktails in the bar were great. It's only a short walk from two tube stations, and close to lots of London landmarks. Overall, a fantastic weekend. "
May 2016,Excellent service and stay!!,I love staying at the Hari Hotel when I come to London on business which is about 6-8 times a year. They have been so welcoming and friendly each time. The service is amazing. The rooms are modern and chic. Very comfortable. Gym on site for exercise. The restaurant downstairs is also excellent - I've had breakfast and dinner and always loved my meal. Staff is friendly and accommodating. Couldn't recommend it more! 
May 2016,"Perfect spot, great service",The first pleasant surprise was a lovely early check in after having flown in from Australia - add to that an unexpected room upgrade which was just lovely. The rooms are great sizes for London and are very nicely appointed. Molton Brown toiletries are a very nice touch. The staff were very attentive and went out of their way to help or offer you something. As I'm typing this after checkout I have already had the offer of a complimentary morning coffee while I sit on the comfy couches in the foyer. There are quite a few great spots to sit and relax. Big thanks to Nico for making brekky a fun start to the day each morning. I would definitely stay here again.
May 2016,London in May,The only issue was London was having a heat wave in May....28c and the air con struggled to cope but they were quick to bring a fan. Belgravia is a fantastic area....very neighbourhood like but Kensington and Chelsea 20 minutes walk away. The staff are fantastic....I could not fault anyone
April 2016,Wonderful hotel,Very sophisticated hotel. Just 5 minutes walk from knightbridge in a very chic area.  The rooms are very confortable with nice interior decoration. Nice restaurant and bar to meet with friends. Perfect for business travel 
April 2016,A very ple.asant hotel!!,"No complaints at all!!  The Belgrave is one of the nicest London hotels that I have stayed in.  It situated in a lovely location, away from the hustle and bustle of busy London.  The staff couldn't be more helpful.  We only stayed for one night but would happily return.  Everything was great.  Top marks for cleanliness, topped off with extremely comfortable beds and bedding!!"
April 2016,Very comfortable hotel in a calm part,"I have spent two days in this hotel. It is really chic, clean, quiet. Great service, very friendly staff and very good location in a quiet part of Belgravia, walking distance from Harrod's and Harvey Nichols."
April 2016,Superb!,Great hotel. Subtle and sleek with the most amazing staff. Extremely comfortable rooms and really loved the bar especially well looked after by Nabil.  Will be back on next visit to London when I will bring the family.
April 2016,Overnight stay,"A very comfortable boutique hotel, with a nice atmosphere in the bar/lounge area.  Staff were very helpful, although the bar was a little busy and service a bit slow late evening.  Rooms were really clean, bed was very comfortable.  Ask for a room high up or at the back, as 'super cars' were out early hours of morning and quite noisy - this could have been a once off.  I would definitely recommend this for a convenient and friendly hotel in the heart of London."
April 2016,A room with a view,"We arrived today and got a room at 9. Floor wow, great view over the London Skyline. The staff is very kind , the hotel could need some new brush-up, the room is not up-to modern interior, old contacts need more equipment to  mobile phones . It is very quiet when you close the aircondition .  Location is great in Belgravia."
August 2015,"Excellent service, great location, small rooms","We are refurbishing our flat and decided to stay for a few days at this place which is a few hundred yards from where we live. We reserved a suite, i.e a small lounge, bed room and a tiny bath room with one sink and just the space to hardly move (One person at a time). The service in this hotel is great and the staff very dedicated and efficient. We had a logistic problem in our room and they did everything they could to solve it. I like the place but I am not sure I could accept a so tiny space for such a price. I have been staying in tens of hotel in London and never had this clostrophobic feeling. Apart from that, the hotel is classy and pleasant."
February 2016,Quiet location But in heart of London !,"I love this small hotel, very comfy and staff is the friendliest I dealt with.   rooms are well designed and decorated. Bathrooms are stunning I loved them.   Location is one of the main features of this hotel, In the heart of Lonodn.   Will stay here again for sure. (was not our 1st time)"
January 2016,Perfection in details,"I'm not a native English speaker, but I feel that I should right about this hotel to pay them back for the great time.  Tylhey helped me celebrate my wife's birthday in a very special way. Room arrangements, upgrade, flowers, special dinner from Chef Sophie, and finally amazing breakfast and complementary gifts delivered to the our room. That's all in addition to beautiful decorations, welcoming staff, cleanliness, beaty, comfort, and harmony in every detail. Truly unforgettable stay!!"
February 2016,Just touched down in london town,"Was able to spend 5 nights in London at the end of January. The hotel was beautiful and luxurious. Central location walking distance to two different tube lines and the tourist stop Harrods. Staff were very accommodating and lovely. All the Door men were always helpful, Diego on concierge was always helpful and provided us with tickets to an event we couldn't get tickets too, Would love to return to this hotel again."
February 2016,perfect stay in london,Perfect location. Excellent concierge services and service in general. Had a perfect stay in London. Staff at front desk and hotel reception very helpful. A big thank you to Simo for running after our cab with my husband s laptop when leaving for the airport...
November 2015,Very nice,"Great location, great arquitecture, great service.  Ver nice bar. Rooms are small but very nice. Just hated the WC, very uncomfortable.  The rooms may have more light, they look nice but are dark.  Everything else is great."
February 2016,Fantastic weekend!!,Came to stay at Belgraves for the first time and struggle to find anything bad to say! The room was cosy with a great ensuite with luxury molten brown toiletries which was a bonus! Staff were friendly and more than happy to help with any queries. I had forgotten my hairbrush and they happily provided a comb.Our two night stay was only made better by the delicious breakfast! Would absolutely return tomorrow!
February 2016,Fantastic stay,"Recently stayed at the Belgraves for 2 nights with my partner. We were staying on the top floor in a suite. It was very comfy and the space well used. The room had everything we could have needed. The bed was large and very comfortable. We had great views of the London eye, Big Ben and the Shard. The hotel was very quiet and the Windows did a great job of blocking out noise from the busy streets below. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Thank you for a great stay, hope to be back soon!"
February 2016,Nice hotel with a few drawbacks,"Great-looking hotel with an impressive entrance. Receptionists were all stunning but vaguely irritable and required a deposit on arrival (we'd pre-paid for the room) plus photocopies of both of our IDs and both of our full names and contact information. I guess they thought we might nick something? Not the most flattering arrival experience.   The room was nice but small. Free wifi in the rooms was absolutely fine for our needs, and a great feature. We had a King Deluxe which was advertised as the larger of the basic rooms. I'm not sure what size the King Superior is but would guess that it would be a bit cramped for two people. Had an ancient iPod dock on the bedside table that wouldn't work with any newer generations or any other brands of phone, ultimately a bit of a waste of…"
February 2016,GREAT REVISIT,"Fantastic located, Hip Hotel, great trendy doormen to great you!, Articulate staff who are very organised .... The bar has an outside terrace which is a great place  to catch up with friends.  The rooms are compact but with space, comfortable beds ready to catch you after a day of retail therapy! Dont forget to try the breakfast its a must , Go on treat yourself and go for the full english, you will walk it off in no time London!"
February 2016,Superb accomodation & outstanding staff,"I couldn't fault anything about my stay at Belgraves. The staff were attentive and made you feel welcomed from the start. Pont St restaurant is not to be missed. The food is outrageously good. I would 100% recommend Belgraves, and look forward to my next visit there. "
April 2016,Valentines in Belgravia,"Very smart and chic hotel centrally located for Knightsbridge and Chelsea. Excellent accommodation and great service provided by all staff. Highly recommended especially for American visitors due to proximity of major attractions.  Restaurant is very good and the bar comfortable with top quality cocktails. As part of the Thompson group the bohemian design is married to Belgravia smart  not an easy combination but the feel is both smart and welcoming, so they pulled it off. We are booked in again. "
April 2016,"Young, cool and efficient concierge","A modern hotel, cool and young vibe, perfect quiet location but still in the center of London, 10 min walk from Harrods. Reception staff are extremely friendly and nice. I was very happy with their concierge service, Ben was very helpful and efficient, he managed to get us a table at the restaurant i exactly wanted (which is very hard to get during this period) at the exact hour i have requested. It is already my 5th time in this hotel, and i keep on coming back. Thank you for this great service."
April 2016,Great service.,"Everyone who works there is friendly and lovely and the service is fantastic.  Housekeeping is quick and efficient and always on time.  And the concierge -- Violetta -- was very helpful on this trip, finding me several restaurants to try."
April 2016,Fab hotel !!!,Thank you so much for an amazing stay !!we celebrated our 10 year anniversary and the stay was amazing from our arrival the concierge could not be more helpful and  the check in was swift and polite and went out of there way. we arrived to champagne in our room along with chocolate strawberries.  Thank you so much for a unforgettable stay we will recommending you  to friends and family in the future.  Fab rooms and super friendly staff  Thanks again  
March 2016,What a find. Excellent,"Such a great location and a hotel that gets service - everyone so friendly, charming and immensely capable.  Stylish decor that creates a relaxing atmosphere.  Overall a hotel with substance and genuine hospitality which is rare these days.  Particularly want to mention Brian in the Restaurant who went above and beyond at our exquisite lunch.  We will be back soon."
December 2015,Best service possible,The second you arrive MATTIA is at the door giving you undivided attention and helping you every way he can. SIMONA at the front desk gave me all the extra knowledge needed to get around the city. At last but by far not least CELIA put forth the most effort to make me feel welcome at the hotel by going above and beyond. KEEP THOSE THREE HAPPY!!! They are the key to your success.
December 2015,Nice Hotel & Better Staff,"Good location, close to all that matters in Knightsbridge & Belgravia. A well put together product, still in good shape in the rooms. Excellent staff throughout the hotel. A pleasure to stay in; we'll be back."
December 2015,Luxury chic,"Awesome, cutting edge. Every detail is taken care of. The room, exquisitely decorated, and the bathroom were full of light. Flawless. I had a beautiful night sleep. Attentive staff, very NY style. Not to miss out."
October 2015,Great location and super staff modern hotel in Chelsea,"Corner of Pont and Chesham street is this small boutique modern hotel that we stayed in via FHR amex booking. Staff very friendly and accommodating, rooms are warm and cosy and bathroom and large shower modern and clean. We dined in the restaurant downstairs for breakfast and it was fast and very good. This is a great location of walking to all nearby areas including the Kings road/Slone Sq, Bromton Road, or Buckingham Palace and St James's area. Would stay again!"
December 2015,Great Hotel - Even Better Staff!,"What a great hotel.  Modern, comfortable lobby and rooms. Great location. Ridiculously helpful staff! Door men were friendly and on the spot, front desk was knowledgeable, and helpful, even the turn down maid was impressive.  I had a delicious breakfast in the ground floor restaurant where I found they were serving water in some glasses I have been looking for years, when I asked where they got them, the whole staff went above and beyond to not only source them, but find me a full set!  Katrina (?), the General Manager, the food and beverage manager, and breakfast host went out of their way to get these for me and I am so thankful.  When I first arrived, I thought my room was a bit small (I choose the smallest room), but it was so well laid out that I never felt cramped.  The…"
December 2015,Belgraves - what an excellent choice!,"We stayed at Belgraves on a Thursday and Friday night as was working in the SW1 area and had a function in Central London on the Friday.  I arrived separately to my partner, and found to my delight it was only a 10 minute walk from London Victoria train station.   The hotel is set around the lovely Belgravia streets, and embassy central making it a very pleasant area.  After checking in an dropping off my bags, I went to the 1st floor to use the fitness centre - I had the whole place to myself (as usual in smaller hotels!) and the gym was thoroughly kitted out - fresh towels, apples, water, top equipment, good stretch out space, a cable machine and free-weights. Totally spoiled for choice!  I was staying in a Deluxe king room, and it was very nicely made up - my sort of style -…"
December 2015,Stunning Hotel & Outstanding Customer Service,"I booked this hotel for our accommodation during our Company Christmas Party (10 rooms).  From the offset, I found the Sales Manager (Giuseppe) to be fantastic.  Nothing was too much trouble and he organised our stay to finite detail (even upgrading my MD and surprising him with a Birthday Cake, and taking good care of the Events Organiser :-)  It's the personal touches like these that make a stunning hotel an OUTSTANDING hotel!  The décor is very chic and trendy... very 'cool Britannia'!   I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in the Knightsbridge area.  Thanks again to Giuseppe and the rest of the staff at the Belgraves."
December 2015,What a great find! ,We were searching for a boutique hotel for our wedding anniversary. This was perfect. Combination of feel of the place and the service. The staff were very welcoming and the room was excellent - even though we booked last minute deal. There was champagne in the room. Small things make a big difference. In our case we used valet parking and forgot about the time on Sunday. When we got back the doorman had picked up our car to avoid the extra half day charge. Really thoughtful service. Thank you for surprising us in a positive way. Used to different types of surprises in London hotels. 
December 2015,Great Hotel in the middle of London,"I just had the great opportunity to stay the first time at the Belgrave a Thompson Hotel and it was fantastic. Anita who checked me in and out was absolutely friendly and knew about my reason to stay at the hotel. Without asking she informed me about the location of the event I needed to attend in the city. Well done. The rooms are beautifully decorated and have the normal size for a London hotel. After all it is a boutique hotel that offeres great comfort. The location is great as well, within walking distance to Harrods and Buckingham Palace. I loved the breakfast setting and buffet and the friendliness of all staff members. Everybody greeted me whenever and wherever I met an employee.   Please ignore the comments from the previous review about small rooms and small lifts.…"
December 2015,"Tiny Rooms, Overpriced, Lobby Smells","Upon arriving at the Belgraves, a wall of dirty UK pub smell welcomes you.  After checking in, cram yourself into the two-person lift to get to your room.  Hopefully you, your suitcase, or your lift mate aren't overly large.  Discover that even the ""deluxe"" rooms are quite small.  Go to take a bath, and find there is no tub.  Explore various ways of opening a shower door that collides with the toilet when opening outward, or gets the hanging towels wet when opening inwards. Ponder the strange placement of small windows around the room.    Admire the relatively tasteful decor.  Enjoy the clean and comfortable bed, the free wifi and variety of TV stations.  Restaurant food was good, but service was terrible.  Apparently the bar and drinks are quite popular amongst locals.  In…"
March 2016,Amazing Stay - best in London so far,"Believe me when I tell you that this place is amazing. From the moment you walk it it's classy without being tacky, the staff is attentive and friendly without being over bearing and the room (and even hallways) are immaculate! Well done (and the a la carte breakfast is good too and so is the staff!)"
March 2016,Great service,Thank you to Simona for the outstanding service. We honestly had the best hotel experience in many years thanks to the staff mainly. We recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to have a calm and sophisticated stay in London. 
March 2016,"Great location, lovely stay!","We stayed here, expecting high standards owing the location is the very upscale Belgravia. The hotel isn't the prettiest, but the check in, housekeeping, door staff and room service were excellent. We had a minor issue with the food quality when we ate in the restaurant for one evening meal, but otherwise we had a very enjoyable stay. The 10 min walk to the tube station at Sloan Square wasn't a problem at all, and the door staff were excellent at getting us a cab when we needed it. Our room was a little on the small side, but this is Central London after all, but well appointed bathroom and facilities. Overall a very enjoyable stay. "
March 2016,"Great location, friendly staff","Great location: walking distance from Sloane's Square, Kings Road, Harrods and Knightsbridge Quick access to public transport to the City or other parts of town. In a residential neighbourhoods, quiet, but within short distance of many restaurants and shops. Rooms are modern, nicely appointed, albeit on the small side. Nice evening turndown service with water and homemade cookies provided. Staff was polite and friendly.  Would certainly use again next time I am back in London."
March 2016,"Small rooms, friendly staff, busy bar","We stayed here for two nights recently in a King Deluxe room.  The room was very small, we were dancing round each other to get our stuff out of the wardrobe.  Also the bathroom was small, only one person in there at a time.  All clean though, with a nice view of the Shard and the London Eye.  The tv turned itself on in the middle of the night for some unknown reason but this was fixed the next day when I reported it to reception.  There were nice homemade biscuits at turndown but the turndown housekeeper seemed very stressed both nights and we told her not to worry about our turndown in the end.  Staff here are very friendly, particularly the doormen who are great.  They offer a cheese and wine hour to guests but it was not at all well supported although we did enjoy it - free…"
January 2016,Birthday weekend trip to London,"This is the second time we have stayed in this hotel.  We usually opt for staying around Marylebone, but glad we chose the Belgraves for my birthday weekend.  We were with my two daughters, who also loved the hotel, so no doubt they will choose to stay there again, as we will, hopefully for longer next time.  The staff are excellent and it has a very personal feel.  The common areas are very stylish, and a great atmosphere."
January 2016,Lovely boutique hotel is amazing location,We stayed at hotel for 1 night and we were super impressed with the hotel. The design is very cool and modern with fantastic bedrooms with everything you need. The hotel is small but has a great atmosphere. The staff were very welcoming and couldn't do enough to help us. We would stay there again - a great experience
January 2016,Lovely weekend stay,"The hotel is located in a great spot, between Knightsbridge and Sloane Square, which is ideal for shopping and getting around the city. Pont St restaurant is brilliant - great food, the menu has lots of indulgent dishes but also healthy options. The bar was really buzzy when we were there on a Saturday night and the hidden terrace was lovely for a post dinner drink. The rooms are chic and very comfortable, with the best beds I've ever slept in!"
January 2016,Wonderful Weekend-Best hotel we've been to in London!,"I booked the Belgraves for a night as a birthday surprise for my boyfriend. Upon arrival we had a warm welcoming and   easy check in.   The room we stayed in was lovely. Our room had everything we needed and more, with perfect little touches. We had the best nights sleep that we've had in a long time as the bed was so comfortable.   We ordered room service for breakfast and it was delivered right on time as requested. The food was amazing, and it was definitely the best eggs Benedict we've had.   We couldn't fault our stay one bit as everything was perfect. The staff were friendly and provided a wonderful service. The hotels facilities were great too. We will definitely be staying at the hotel again and highly recommend a stay there to anyone.  "
January 2016,Nothing can go wrong,"Congratulations for keeping the experience to the ultimate level. All very well settled, personnel as happy and helpful as always, bar and atmosphere exceptional as always. Rooms maintained to the highest standards. Congrats to management team and crew for their overall performance - rare to experience such a flawless hospitality. Best"
December 2015,First Class Hotel,"First Class Hotel, central location, rooms like your own home, chic bar, service top level, staff friendly and always remember your name and your likes etc, for a boutique hotel you cannot find better in London."
December 2015,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel , near the shopping area and Hyde park. Many good restaurant s near the hotel. The cleanliness of the commen area and the room excellent. The smoking area in the hotel is like a suspended garden very cute to take aperitif. The bar is very nice also . For the breakfast honestly can do better. Ben the concierge and a women concierge how is forgent the name are very professional and cute. "
January 2016,Wonderful stay - truly five star service,I stayed here for my birthday with my boyfriend and it was the best stay I have ever had in London. The staff were friendly and very attentive throughout the stay and couldn't have done more for us. We had champagne and strawberries in our room and brownies as it was a special occasion! The view from my room was fantastic we could see right across London. The overall atmosphere in the hotel was very relaxed and there was a great vibe in the restaurant. We did plan on going out for dinner however the restaurant came highly recommended by other guests so we ended up staying in - and were so pleased we did! The food was fantastic! We will definitely be staying again and highly recommending it to friends and family. The location is 5 minutes from Sloane Square and Hyde Park so as a…
December 2015,Beautiful Staycation,"Booked in at Belgraves to celebrate mine and my boyfriend's 5th anniversary and we were so impressed. We were given a complimentary upgrade to a beautiful suite which had fantastic views  especially from the incredible marble bathroom which overlooks a lovely square. Staff were very friendly and helpful, we really didn't want to leave the next day!"
December 2015,location location location!,"Loved this hotel! Location is excellent: on a very quiet square but just two steps off Sloane Street and all the glam shops.  The architect/designer has done a great job with the rooms: we had a superior king (the entry level room) and although it is quite a small room, the allocation of space is amazing with an enormous and comfortable shower. Bath in marble, wooden floor in the rest of the room. Lovely colors, excellent textile's choices.  Only 2 small flaws: night table lights were not independent (so either you both read or both sleeps) and there was not a plug for the hair dryer in the bathroom or in any vicinity of a mirror (so I had to dry and comb my hair using a lot of fantasy...). Lovely young staff and very helpful, cleaniless was excellent, evening downturn perfect…"
November 2015,We will return again and again and again...,"What a wonderful find!  Fabulous location, walking distance to Harrods, Sloane Square and Pimlico.  The hotel itself is one of the friendliest and most welcoming hotels we have stayed at in London.  The bar serves superb cocktails and there's a delightful cigar terrace outside.  Rooms are spacious, well designed, stylish and comfortable.  The bed was incredibly comfortable, which is so important but not always the case in hotels.  The hotel was immaculate throughout the public areas and the bedroom and bathroom.  This hotel really is a home from home, comfort is key and the staff just could not do enough for us.  We will return again and again and again."
November 2015,Marvelous Stay,"What an incredible hotel.  The property itself was stunning and alive and the restaurant was spectacular.  This was only outdone by the warm, friendly informative and caring staff.  I was so impressed from the moment I stepped out of the car and was greeted by Isreal and Mattia (the bell men) they escorted me into the beautiful lobby where the front desk crew took it from there.  The other bell men Simo, Simone and Mike were also on it through out the stay.  Anita, Hayley and Celia as well as others were so caring and made me feel at home.  Violetta the concierge hooked us up every night for dinner and tickets to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which was so much better that either movie.  The whole crew including the restaurant staff and especially the bar upstairs were…"
November 2015,Exquisite stay at Belgraves,"I have travelled the world and this is one of the loveliest hotels I've ever stayed out. The staff were so attentive -from the bellman to the concierge. Everyone was so helpful and really seemed to be invested in ensuring an excellent stay for us. The front desk staff remembered us and were helpful every step of the way.  The hotel itself  is in a perfect location with some of the best restaurants and shopping that London has to offer within walking distance.   The hotel was classy and chic and simply breathtaking. The attention to detail every step of the way was the perfect balance between decadent and feeling at home. The bars were comfy and refined and the cigar bar was not to be missed.  If you have the chance, I wouldn't stay anywhere else but The Belgraves. Thank you!!!!"
October 2015,Great...,"Spent two night here and we enjoyed every bit. We were on the 9th floor with a balcony with direct views of St Pauls cathedral and London skyline - the bed is very cosy and comfortable and everything you needed in a room was there.  The location is great, everything we needed was within walking distance - which was great after finishing work and checking in.  Staff are attentive and courteous. Breakfast was DELISH!  They also do afternoon tea there which is great! Highly recommend!  "
November 2015,Great stay from start to finish - we will definitely stay again!,"From the moment we walked into the hotel we enjoyed every minute of our stay. The check in was efficient and friendly, the ladies were both helpful and a pleasure to speak with. We had been upgraded to a larger room which was an added bonus, we'd assumed this was because we were celebrating both our birthdays and wedding anniversary but our friends who also stayed had the same upgrade. The room was very nice with a decent view, great size and a very comfortable bed. We arrived back after a wonderful evening out to find a bottle of champagne and fruit bowl in our room, what a great touch! Check out wasn't until 12pm so we weren't rushing and then we were able to leave our luggage with concierge. We certainly felt our custom was appreciated and the hotel now has to be one of our…"
November 2015,Bravo!,"This is hotel is the definition of the boutique hotel. It has the proper size. Not to small so that its bar and its restaurant are alive and not big so as to have a standard impersonal service.  The staff of the hotel is excellent. From the doormen to the receptionists to the waiters. All young people, eager to help you and make your life easier.  The location of the hotel is top. Best shopping in London within walking distance. Knightsbridge tube 7 minutes away walking distance as well. Super safe to go around anytime of the day or night as all the embassies are located in the area.  Design of the hotel and the rooms simply amazing though this is something ambiguous as beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Room size are on the smallish side but this is something that you do…"
September 2015,"Location, great value and terrific service","I stay here at least twice a month and this hotel always delivers with great attention to detail and personal preferences, friendly and efficient service and an unbeatable location, close to all the restaurants, museums and shopping in Knighstbridge, Chelsea and Belgravia, and a short taxi ride or walk into the West End of London - and it has a gym, restaurant and terrace bar. It is a very short taxi ride from Victoria railway station for trains to Gatwick airport, and also offers quick access to Heathrow airport via the motorway."
October 2015,nice hotel,i have visited friends who stayed in the hotel. great little place.the outdoor coffee place is lovely. the rooms are modern and boutiquey.i have been trying to stay there but its hard to get a booking.tks 
October 2015,Luxury at affordable price - outstanding customer service!,"I picked the Belgraves due to its location and price point and after reading the other reviews decided to give it a try. I have stayed at the Lanesborough Hotel,which is nearby, but at more than double the price it wasn't in my budget this trip. I must say the attention to welcoming guests, making sure they are comfortable and their needs met was superb at the Belgraves! Upon check in they sent tea to my room (my friend had coffee as she requested) and were attentive to any of our needs. they serve complimentary cheese and wine every night for an hour in their lovely bar on the first floor. If i was waiting form friend someone would come to ask if I needed a drink while i was waiting. The rooms were extremely nice and my Jr. Suite had a little alcove with a couch to enjoy…"
October 2015,Amazing Afternoon Tea,"Fantastic afternoon tea at the Pont Street hotel. Every whim catered for. Great choice of teas. The service was amazing and the young waiter who served us was very friendly, nothing was too much trouble for him ... And he didn't laugh when we asked how to use the unusual tea strainer! If you want the best Afternoon Tea in London book here"
October 2015,Fantastic Hotel,"We have used this hotel for years, and since it has been re-furbished it is really special.  I cannot fault the Staff.  Beds are really comfortable and the rooms are a perfect size. Always a pleasure to stay at The Belgraves"
October 2015,Super Chic,We love the location & the plush rooms overlooking a leafy London  square. All the Belgraves team were great & made the atmosphere very en famille & dinner was exceptional! Have already booked in for our next London trip. 
October 2015,Great contemporary hotel,"I've stayed at the Belgraves more than 50 times now - yes, you guessed, I really rate it!  It's got   a great West End location' cool rooms, a buzzy bar, and brilliant staff; friendly attractive and always willing to go the extra mile."
May 2015,A great all round hotel!,"What an amazing hotel, the rooms are of very good size, very clean and service is impeccable. Starting off your day with a very well made breakfast or brunch at the Pont St place, the afternoon tea or drinks in the Cigar Lounge, and the fantastic burger served until after midnight for those who stay up late. Will be definitely visiting again!"
October 2015,Cant wait to stay there again!,"I stayed at Belgraves Hotel for 3 times .. and will stay there again next Dec for holiday season! Its a bouique hotel with elegant details and so cosy I stayed at Superior room which is smallest but yet great size even for 2 adults with all facilities you need! Wifi is fast, very clean room and service is amazing! the front desk staff and the concierge are so friendy and always smiling and willing to help! the special thing when I arrive they are waiting for me with a smile and they all know my name :) I also tried breakfast at room which was there on time requested and so delicious!  I usually visit London 2 to 3 times a year and would never stay anywhere else Xx"
October 2015,Extraordinary personalized service,I was referred to the Belgraves by a colleague who visits London often.  My experience was top notch. The contemporary refined interiors include an excellent restaurant. Rooms are comfortable with up to date amenities. There is a sincere effort at this hotel to insure guests feel at home. The concierge personnel are knowledgeable and persistent in pursuing guests requests. Most striking though is the personal attention provided by the staff. Upon departure I left a significant amount of cash in the room safe. The hotel notified me immediately and took measures to return the cash and a passport case expeditiously. I look forward to returning to Belgraves soon.
October 2015,Great service and good quality (for London!),"Overall, I've always had a good experience at this hotel.  The service is very attentive and personalised, which is surprisingly hard to find even at luxury hotels in London.  I also like that the employees are personable and professional without being arrogant or difficult.    The entire hotel is fairly new, and the rooms are crisp and modern.  The basic room is fairly small, but this is comparable to the average (high end hotel in London).  My only complaint is that the room is a bit dark (no overhead lighting).    The location is Belgravia/Knightbridge is exceptional!    I normally gravitate to ""chain"" hotels like Jumeriah, Hyatt ot Mandarin Oriental hotels (for the points or status), but London has become one city where I make an exception."
October 2015,Great experience ,Great rooms. Great service. Great location overall a very enjoyable stay and will definitely return next time I am visiting  Rooms had plenty of space. Very nicely decorated. Was even promoted to a suite on the top floor. Breakfast was also very good. Highly recommend the healthy choices. 
May 2015,Excellent central hotel,"Two night stay visiting London. Excellent staff who couldn't have been more friendly, great location for shopping and exploring the west side of London (ran both mornings around Green Park) and an excellent level of fit out (room, shower, bathroom etc). We had a room overlooking the road but the windows were very well insulated and it didn't disturb us at all. We didn't eat at the hotel (too many other options!!) so no comments on that side of things and the only slight niggle is that the mattress topper on the bed was uneven but once that was taken off all was fine. As a couple we would definitely stay there again on our next visit to London."
October 2015,One of the finest!,"From the moment we got there 'till the moment we left, everything was amazing. The staff was very friendly and helpful, while the room was very well cleaned and neat. We also loved the food in the Pont St. We had a really nice stay there and we definitely recommend it!"
August 2015,My Home from Home,"Friendly, smiling, happy staff. Cool design. Youthful fun vibe. Quick and efficient service. Perfect pillows. Top location. Superb views from upper floors. Best cappuccino in London. Great food. I stay 20-30 nights a year at the Belgraves and see it as my home from home."
February 2015,Luxury,"I honestly can't recommend this hotel highly enough. My wife and I spent four nights and five days in London for my wife's 30th birthday, staying at this hotel in the heart of Belgravia.  The hotel was immaculate and the service was better than excellent. The staff couldn't be more welcoming or hospitable, they literally couldn't do enough for us!  There was complimentary drinks on arrival and they had a large chocolate brownie cake with 'happy birthday' scribed on it sent to the room.  We dined in the restaurant before getting a cab to the Queens theatre to see Les Miserables and the food and wine was delicious. Again, the restaurant staff were attentive and very welcoming.  We used the bar several times after a long days sightseeing and the beer was served perfectly chilled.…"
August 2015,it was very beautiful hotel.,"The rooms were so clean and so nice . staffs were very friendly and smile.it was not so far from the town.the price was not so expensive .if i have a free time ,i will go back to stay here again.and ,i think that,many people like it."
July 2015,"Excellent hotel, Brilliant customer service","I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and it was lovely, the rooms were clean and the views were amazing. I highly recommend the restaurant as well as they have brilliant customer service and the food is delicious."
July 2015,Nice hotel but service could be better,"The property is new and modern.  Rooms are a tad small (we booked a suite which is actually just a bigger room, with no separate sitting area).  Great location.  We were a bit let down by the service - some of the desk/ concierge staff did not appear to be very familiar with nearby places/ transportation.  We left something behind and when we emailed them 3/4 days later, they quickly responded saying that yes, some items have been found in the room.  Happy with the quick response, but it would have been better if they took the initiative to email us.  There was no breakdown of what had been left in the room.  Surprised to find that close to 130 pounds had been charged to my credit card for shipping without first notifying me of the shipping costs - what we left behind was a…"
July 2015,Mr Apolo vieira,I'd been there for my first time last July with my family. The staff was friendly and kind. Accommodations are good and localization is very convenient and charming as the hotel at all. I'd truly recommend the stay in this cozy place as a great refuge from the london's skyscrapers.
July 2015,"Great service, nice room and decent neighbourhood","We stayed in the hotel for 5 days. First the staff were helpful and provided great service from the moment we stepped in the room, and helpful with our enquires. The room is clean and tidy with some view at the higher floor. The location is a bit far from tube but is within walking distance to Sloane square/ Knight bridge/ Victoria. Pretty close to the high end fashion shops and Harrod's. The neighborhood is quiet and safe, and is actually quite near to foreign embassies. And it is also close to a little street with some pretty cool restaurants.   The bed is comfortable but the variety of pillow choices was limited, couldn't find a softer pillow during my stay."
July 2015,A lovely boutique hotel w/ very nice staff,We were resident for a week. There is no fault w/ the hotel. The staff is very nice and attentive. The breakfast is perfect. The rooms while a bit tight are well appointed and provide all one might seek. My only note is that one does have to walk at least 10 minutes to Knightsbridge and 20 minutes to Sloan Square. But a small price to pay for such nice company. We shall return.
July 2015,Outstanding service and great location,"The service extended to me by the Belgraves staff, in particular the front office management team of Parvez and Renata, was second to none. They went above and beyond their duties to ensure my stay was luxurious and hassle free.  The high service level and quality of the room gave the impression of a large 5-star luxury hotel but at half the price.  Would definitely return."
June 2015,Amazing service,"The hotel is centrally located for easy acces to Sloane street , Harrods and kings road. Service levels are second to none, they will assist and help with all requests.  Totally recommend The Belgraves."
July 2015,Redefining Luxury - Belgraves,"My experience at Belgraves, a Thompson Hotel was nothing short of superior.  It was so good I returned within 2 weeks.  My first stay I had a king premium room, which catered to my needs perfectly.  I spent a lot of time outside the hotel, but returning was an absolute delight.  The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive, without being pushy or overbearing.  The room was incredibly comfortable, perfect for relaxing after a busy day. When I returned a few weeks later I was able to enjoy the additional luxury of a studio suite.  It was so comfortable I spent more time at the hotel than I had originally intended.  One of my guilty pleasures is to have a bath before going to bed, so the well designed marble bathroom made this experience extra special.  I first booked…"
July 2015,A wonderful experience,"We stayed here a week. The staff was very attentive and helpful. Great with directions and information. Room was lovely. Love the turndown service with bottled water and cookies. Had room service one evening, and the food was excellent. Would stay here again,"
July 2015,Great Boutique hotel in posh hood,"We had a great stay at the Belgraves and it felt very much like a Kimpton Hotel (before IHG takeover) in the USA which is a great compliment.  I would say it's one of the top properties we have visited in a European city.  Pros: - very friendly and helpful staff across door staff, front desk and housekeeping - views from 11 floor corner room were amazing and multiple windows revealed close to a 270 degree view including small walk out balcony - room was modern and clean with nice touches such luxury bath products, slippers, and evening treats in turndown service  - location is convenient to underground and major sites - neighborhood is very peaceful and quiet with really ornate apartment blocks on different styles   Cons (very minor): - for room price, it would have been nice to…"
July 2015,Great hotel with very helpful staff,Stayed one night at this hotel.  Great location for Hyde Park and Kensington Palace and Royal Albert Hall - all within easy walking distance. Staff were very helpful and certainly made us very welcome.  Always on hand to help without being overbearing.  Food in the restaurant was outstanding - the crab ravioli was delicious!  My only wish was that I'd asked for a kettle for making tea so I could have had a cuppa first thing in the morning - this was complimentary but you had to ask for it to be brought to the room.  There was a tassimo coffee machine in the room but no instructions! Wasn't too worried though - would have preferred tea!
July 2015,Summer getaway,"The single best choice in hotels made this trip to London. In a city, where you're not starved for choice, The Belgraves proved to be a stand out selection and one we'll return to on our future trips to London.  From entry to exit a fantastic experience. The attentive and helpful doorman, the experienced and sharp staff at check in and concierge who was accessible and available when required all presented themselves well, while not becoming overbearing.  We were scheduled to check in at 3:00, yet arrived 2 hours early and while fully expecting to wait for our room, which seems to be typical for London, were refreshed to find the room available and allowed to check in and freshen up prior to heading back out. We recognize this may not always be possible, however were extremely…"
July 2015,Fabulous Hotel Experience,"The Belgraves London Hotel is one of the best hotel experiences ever. The room design and quality is top notch and the friendly professional service is truly outstanding. From the lobby to the restaurant to the gym and the room service, all details are expertly taken care of so you can enjoy a fabulous experience. The Belgraves will always be my first choice London hotel."
June 2015,A fantastic stay,"We had an overnight stay at the Belgraves Hotel and I can't rate it highly enough. On arrival the staff were very friendly and polite & we were made to feel very welcome. We were asked if we were celebrating an occasion & we told them it was our wedding anniversary.  We were congratulated and had our room upgraded and were given a complimentary bottle of champagne. This was the perfect start to our celebrations.  The room was great, very stylish as is the whole hotel. The bathroom was very nice with a great double shower.  The bed and furnishings were very comfortable and luxurious.  The Hotel is just a joy to be in, the dimmed lighting and amazing furniture give it such a cool feeling.  The bar area was good and we sat out on the terrace enjoying a couple of gin & tonics - nice…"
July 2015,Lovely and helpful staff,"I know hotel rooms in London are small but our room was tiny. So small in fact the first thing reception suggested to us was up-grading. Not the arrival I had been looking forward to.   The staff were all lovely and very helpful. The hotel is modern with a good vibe and a decent bar. Location is good for walking around Belgravia and Westminster. Its only a 10 minutes walk to Knightsbridge Tube and Harrods (boring and over rated).    Not somewhere I would rush back to, there was nothing wrong with it but I would rather try somewhere else on my next visit."
May 2015,Wimbledon Respite,"Most accommodating staff, well managed and we most appreciated our room being available to us upon check in after flying over from The U.S.  They also accommodated us for a late check out when I had the chance to play tennis on grass on our check out date and needed a quick shower.  Rooms and bathroom were kind of small, but it was close to The Sloan Station Tube stop, which we took daily to the matches.  Lots of great restaurants in the area and a fun, vibrant neighborhood of Belgravia."
June 2015,"Nice design, friendly service, great location.","We spent two weekends at Belgraves in just over a month and really loved our experience. This is slowly becoming our favourite place in London!  Staff is very friendly, rooms are nicely designed (loved the bathroom) and location is excellent, especially if you want to be in the Sloane Street/Belgravia/South Kensington area  During our second stay we had a room with view on the square which we preferred to the room we had during our first stay (at the back of the hotel, hardly any view and smaller). But I guess this is linked to the type of room we booked.  They also have a very good bar by the way, ideal for pre-dinner drinks or a nightcap.   We will certainly return.   "
June 2015,Perfect spot for our Wimbleton experience!!,Wonderful setting and service!  The staff is excellent ! They were all so willing to make our stay exceptional! The concierge service was exceptional! Diego and Violetia were the most helpful! Thank you for making our stay wonderful! Georgia Enright               
June 2015,Wonderful stay,"I stayed at belgraves for four days, the staff is lovely and helpful. The area is quiet and homy but still close to all the right places. Breakfast is very nice and fresh. You will not regret your stay!              "
May 2015,Hotel was awesome,This hotel was awesome and perfect for business travel.  The rooms where very clean and comfortable.  The hotel restaurant was also delicious!  I really enjoyed my stay and will book here again when I return to London for business.
June 2015,Great hotel in the heart of Belgravia,"All the staff was very helpful and polite, the room was impecable and well design. The location is great and convenient. The tube is only minutes walking and there are plenty of nice restaurants around it I will stay here again for sure!       "
June 2015,An amazing experince in London,For the past years Ive always stayed in the same hotel in London but this time I decided to make a change and take a friends advice to trying the belgraves hotel especially that it's in the area where u prefer to stay. I stated for one night only but I can say it was one of my best experiences the hotel staff was professional and friendly and the room was very clean with good furniture. I would definitely stay in the belgraves for my next visit
June 2015,Chic Hotel located in beautiful Belgravia,"We chose this hotel because we had a great experience staying at a Thompson Hotel in New York... The Belgraves by Thompson is a sexy and stylish hotel with some New York edginess. The staff were outstanding - very friendly and accommodating. The rooms were beautiful and well appointed. The bar on level 1 was a great spot to enjoy a drink and relax. The location was great - very close to Harrods, Harvey Nicks Knightsbridge and the tube stations. Belgravia is a very expensive part of London, every second car is a Ferrari or Bentley. There are some great restaurants and gastro pubs close by. We would fully recommend this hotel. "
May 2015,Worth a Visit,This is a boutique hotel and I stayed here overnight with my daughter and son in law as a birthday gift.  The staff on learning it was my birthday provided small cakes in my room to share.  The location is perfect for walking - within a ten minute walk of Hyde Park and less than half an hour to Oxford Street.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  The rooms were well appointed and had everything needed for a comfortable stay. Air condition worked perfectly and I had a great view over the city. Excellent full English breakfast with delicious coffee.
May 2015,Rate incl breakfast but ...,"Found a great last minute deal, which included breakfast. But no one explained that it only included continental breakfast, even though we chose cheaper items from the menu we were charged for them which I found really annoying. That is the reason I am not rating this Hotel excellent, everything was - great room, super staff.               "
May 2015,Loved it,Stayed with mum For Chelsea flower show and business trip. Perfect location walkable to everywhere in Chelsea and Knightsbridge. Lovely front desk service was checked into the room early. Neat sized room but perfectly designed to accommodate a velvet sofabed and kingsize bed with privacy for both of us. Ate out nearby but the breakfast service was so friendly and warm and the best coffee ever. They forgot to offer us champagne as part of our package but it was just an oversight. I'll be planning another stay here soon I hope
May 2015,Great location ,Staff in general are very helpful. The atmosphere is relaxed and we felt very comfortable. However the overall experience was spoilt by a few things.   There was a party on the terrace which our room overlooked which dictated when we went to bed due to the noise. We sought refuge in the bar which wasn't a bad thing. The barman was great and mixes great cocktails!   The hotel is very warm and in the night we felt stifled so had to put on the air con which was really loud and meant we couldn't sleep. We had to turn it off and resorted to opening the window but the blackout blind kept banging and again meant we couldn't sleep.   In the morning we ordered a couple of coffees but these took almost an hour to arrive. We had to call housekeeping for shower gel and shampoo as they…
December 2014,Drinks reception,Pleasantly greeted at the hotel by two very helpful doormen who guided me towards my friends in the mezzanine lounge!  Very attentive staff on hand with drinks and delicious canapes. The manager of the hotel gave us a guided tour of the hotel which was very impressive. A small intimate hotel in a great location of London.
January 2015,Enjoyable Stay,This is a belated review of a short stay over the New Year. I booked 3 rooms via Lastminute and had a brief delay at check in when the hotel had only allocated 1 room. However this was quickly dealt with by check in staff and overall we had a pleasant stay at this stylish hotel. The location is excellent - a short walk to Harrods and Sloane Street and it suited us perfectly. Service in the bar could be better but perhaps we were just unlucky. Would stay again.
March 2015,Fashionable Hotel in Knightsbridge / Belgravia,"Stayed at the Belgraves for one night in January 2015 on our way home. Beautiful hotel located on the border between Knightsbridge and Belgravia. Be prepared to see Rolls Royces, Bentleys and Aston Martins parked on the street in front of the hotel.  Rooms are beautifully appointed, but quite small for two people. A bit of a struggle to move around in the room with two large suitcases. Bathrooms are very modern with a separate cubicle for toilet and the shower is a walk in open shower that looks out onto the bedroom with a nice rainfall. One complaint would be that the rooms are quite dark as well with the only good lighting in the bathroom. Walkable distance to Harrods and nice shops in the area.   This hotel is also very close to the Cabman's Shelter where you can get an egg…"
February 2015,"Fabulous property, great location!","Just spent 3 nights at the Belgraves in London.  VERY happy with the property, staff and restuarant (and room service!). Clean, well appointed and the location was in a lovely neighborhood close to Hyde Park and plenty of fabulous shopping.  Highly recommend this hotel - and would definitely return to the Belgraves Hotel."
March 2015,Most Excellent Hotel With Great Standards And The Best Staff Attention To Detail,"One of the best London based hotels I have ever stayed in.  There are too many chain hotels like Marriott and Hilton that just blend into bland.  This hotel is defiantly not that. It's stylish, well maintained and very individual.  I felt like true luxury was around me.  Congratulations to the hotel team.  You have a winner"
March 2015,Perfection across the board.,"After my second perfect stay @ The Belgraves, I just had to post a review.  From the moment you arrive, to the moment you depart, the staff @ The Belgraves makes certain that you want for nothing.  Front desk, concierge and bartender(s) all get special props! The care is hands-down the best you'll receive.  Not to mention the comfort of the rooms, many of which provide sublime, calming views over Belgraves Square.  Rooms are terrifically comfortable for working or just relaxing. (I especially love the international outlets.) It's also situated to all my favorite shops, and Knightsbridge tube station.  Needless to say, I can't wait for my next stay!"
March 2015,London Chic,"I stayed at Belgraves for one night and wish I could have been there for much longer! Camila at check in was very sweet and was able to check us in before the guaranteed time. The room was excellent, the bathroom massive, and I loved the bay windows with the lovely couch. The room was a nice size and quiet which was great. It had the great feeling of sophistication without being pretentious. I'll definitely be back!"
March 2015,Wonderful Birthday Surprise,"Until my son pulled up outside, I had no idea that I was going to the Belgraves for an overnight stay last Saturday as part of my 60th birthday celebration.  We had driven up from Somerset and arrived, as we thought, too early to book in but it seemed that it was no trouble to take our rooms early.  In recognition of my special birthday, we had all been upgraded to King Superior rooms, my husband & I on the front of the hotel overlooking the square on the 7th floor.  It was lovely!  Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff and they were friendly and attentive.   After a trip to Harrods, we returned to get ready for the theatre to find a beautifully presented chocolate birthday cake slice, complete with hand written message from the hotel, waiting - yummy!  It was a…"
March 2015,You couldn't ask for better,"The hotel is beautiful, chic and modern through welcoming. But it's all about the staff. Everyone there is engaged in helping you achieve whatever you need. I learned everything I needed to know to get to the financial district during peak hour from Brian in the restaurant. Kathryn helped me find hair products that I'd forgotten and took the time to find out what time the shop down the road opened so I could get there before my meeting. Nikki in room service created a special pot of tea for me when I arrived sick with the flu and took the time to check on me later. It's the best experience this business traveler has had in years. I will surely be back. I'm planning my next stay already. "
February 2015,Great staff and service,"Great location close to shopping on Sloane street. No excess luxury, the room was a little dark, the mattress could have been softer, and my bathtowel had a big hole in it. But the room was clean and comfortable enough, and we enjoyed our stay. Were upgraded to a Premium room, so avoided the glass wall between shower and bed (which is a stupid trend, I think). They made our bed twice a day, and we had fresh towels every time we returned. The best feature of this hotel is the top notch service throughout. Everyone very friendly, helpful and efficient. Did not have dinner at the hotel, but lunch, snacks and cocktails were very tasty. The breakfast was simple but good. Superfresh croissants. Would definitely stay again."
April 2015,Trendy laid back sophistication,"I've just got back from spending 3 nights at this wonderfully eclectic hotel. From the moment of arriving I felt welcome, fortunately my King Premium room was ready, lucky as my flight into London arrived at 7am. A stunning room with view over the park, everything was just right, free wifi, delightful blue LED lights in bathroom for night lights, REN toiletries and one of the most comfortable beds with proper pillows. The terrace is stunning, done in diiferent shades of grey with walls of green ivy, perfect for that glass of Savignon Blanc to meet friends after shopping at nearby Harrods, Harvey Nic's and Sloane Street. Each and every member of staff were so friendly, it felt more like being ""at home in London"" This is definetly a place to stay! Many thanks to all of you!"
May 2015,Wonderful place to stay!,"We spent 9 nights at the Belgraves.  It is a moderately priced hotel (for London).  The Belgraves is in a stunning neighborhood, within walking distance of public transportation, and has extremely helpful staff.   Our room was perfect. The hotel is in a quiet location, so traffic and street noise did not disturb us. The concierge helped us plan our daily itinerary; they made reservations, ordered a few tickets, and explained how to use the subway. With their assistance, we saw London on our own. We ate once in the restaurant; the food was very good.  Breakfast was not included in our room rate; we found a wonderful local restaurant (Patisserie Valerie) which was located just a few blocks away. The Belgraves does have some exercise equipment which is well maintained. We will…"
April 2015,Very friendly,"it was our first time and for sure we will visit the hotel again .  The stuf have a very nice vibe , they are very friendly .  I wish all hotels are like this . The room are very clean .  My kids love the place .it is a unic hotel .               "
May 2015,excellent lastminute booking,"Its usually pot luck when making a last minute booking, but this was a real treat. Excellent hotel, beautifully and very stylishly appointed, very attentive and polite staff, great room with excellent shower and view over the little green space at the crossroads. Not close to any tube stations but set in a quietish location. Would thoroughly recommend it."
April 2015,"Great hotel, very friendly staff",The hotel has a very nice style and the staff is very friendly and helpful. It is located in a lovely neighbourhood. Good value for money in London. I will definitely come back next time I'm in London
April 2015,Nice nights stay,"Stayed overnight whilst eating at Heston's ""Dinner"" about 1/2 mile away. Friendly check in staff, clean room, great location, nice continental style breakfast. quickly and efficiently resolved minor issues. Free parking overnight outside on the Sunday night we stayed! Would go again."
March 2015,Home Away From Home,"Just returned from another week at Belgraves in London. Whether it was being greeted by name by Riccardo when we got out of our car upon arrival, or the personal attention by all members of staff, we are always made to feel welcome and important when we are there.  The Concierge staff, Ben (Head Conceirge), Violetta and Diego, were extremely helpful and took care of all our needs with efficiency and a smile.  Our suite was spaciious, comfortable, clean and ready for us upon arrival. Décor is modern and cool.  We enjoy the area around Belgraves which is quiet for central London. We will return to Belgraves whenever we are in London."
April 2015,Outstanding!.... Expensive but outstanding!,"I took myself, my Mrs, Mum and Dad up to Belgraves for a surprise 60th Birthday Trip for my Mum. She'd always wanted to stay in a 5 star London hotel, so that's what we did!  Everything about this hotel was magnificent. The service from the moment we got to the hotel was perfection. So helpful and friendly, willing to literally do anything for you.  We were given a complimentary room upgrade due to it being my Mum's special birthday (both rooms upgraded!). The rooms were magnificent. Had everything you could ever possibly want in a hotel room but I wasn't really that surprised. I've stayed in quite a few 5 star hotel around the world so know generally what to expect and this one is one of the better, more 5 star worthy hotels! The bathroom was really nice and had a fantastic…"
March 2015,Beautiful hotel in a great location with very friendly and approcable staff.,"This hotel is located in the heart of Knightsbridge but isn't the least bit stuffy! Décor is gorgeous - very modern with interesting art scattered about. Room (King Size Deluxe) was a good size and as we'd requested an upper floor we had a good view (although it was a very windy day and there was a bit of noise from that). Bathroom was fabulous - bath big enough for 2 and loo screened off. Nice Ren toiletries were a bonus. Bar was very relaxed and a nice spot to while away an hour or meet up with friends. Special mention to the staff who were all - from reception to the bar staff, friendly, helpful but most of all very approachable."
March 2015,Bringing in london some piece of NYC,This hotel over met my expectations. I've been at the Miami one so I had some ideas on what to expect (less nice :-)) but the london one is super cool! Bar and the restaurant are very nice - but food is english only (not my favorite one). Rooms are not too big but still very comfortable. Not giving 5 stars because the open wifi (only option available) was too slow. Will definitely come back !
January 2015,"Great staff, relaxing stay!","Spent 5 nights at the hotel for a quick break from 27 March-1 April. Room was beautiful as usual - the hotel managed to give me my preferred room as I had wanted to stay in the room I stayed in previously. The staff was excellent as well. Everyone was friendly and warm and it was really nice to experience that, especially as I was travelling solo. My first morning, I overslept and missed by in-room breakfast order, but was offered breakfast at a later time once I woke up and the staff was very understanding. Also, the concierge managed to get me tickets to the sold out Alexander McQueen exhibition on short notice, which I appreciated.  The location is great, the hotel is comfortable and contemporary, and the staff is amazing. I really enjoyed my time here and look forward to…"
January 2015,Best Hotel in London!,"Had an amazing stay at the Belgraves!  Stayed there with girlfriends for the night.  Great location, friendly and helpful staff, beautiful decor and rooms.  The hidden gem is the bar and the food.  Everything from the restuarant to room service is first class quality and reasonably priced.  I would recommend this place to anyone visitng London!"
January 2015,Neighborhood feel in trendiest part of London,"Love this hotel! Service was top notch!  Room was comfortable and interestingly decorated, albeit a bit small. (It is London!) Bathroom was beautiful and rainhead shower was divine.  The neighborhood is fantastic--many great restaurants and great shopping--Harrod's is a 5 minute walk away.  Two tube stops not far from the hotel.  Upstairs bar was hip and served great drinks. The overall feel is that you're in your own apartment in the trendiest part of London.  I will definitely stay at this hotel again!"
January 2015,wonderful service,Spent a Saturday evening at the Belgraves a Thompson Hotel my Husband and myself. We were looked after from the minute we arrived the gentleman at reception was great and very helpful. We upgraded straight away and ended up with the Kings Suite which was great. We were celebrating my Husbands birthday and the gentleman at reception arranged for a wonderful happy birthday dessert to be in out room just before we arrived back in the aftrenoon. They waited whilst we had champagne in the bar and it was delivered as we arrived to the room. We had drinks in the bar and the approach again from the staff was professional they engaged in conversation and were happy to ensure our stay went well. The hotel was central and literally only minutes away from Harrods and Harvey Nichols. I also…
December 2014,Wonderful stay in Belgraves London !,"Few minutes walk to Harrods, lots of great shops in walking distance. Sophisticated and beautiful hotel and I was able to sleep well since I am not usually able to while I am traveling.  Staff were very friendly and helpful in everyway and I was able to get lots of help to get to places that I needed to go… since It was my first visit in London."
December 2014,A bit of trendy New York in Belgravia,"Very stylish boutique hotel near Belgrave Square. They were trying quite hard to be trendy, and it lacked a lot of the warmth and character of my favorite hotels, but it was a pleasant stay all the same. The bed was comfortable and I enjoyed the little couch/ lounge area by the window. The biggest issue for me were lights in the room. The first night I could not for the life of me figure out how to turn off all the lights! I pressed & clicked- and there were still random uplights shining, despite my best efforts. By the second night, I had somewhat figured it out. I realized I could have just taken the room card out of the power switch to turn everything off, but it was chilly and I wanted the heat!  There was also a clicking noise that I hear in my room- and my coworker heard…"
December 2014,Nice but at quite a price,"Stayed for a Friday night in early December.  A pricey hotel, but relatively well positioned and tube stations not too far away.  Room was clean, fairly spacious and well equipped.  Bathroom nicely styled, with great walk-in shower.  Have rated as average in relation to the price - if you can get via discount routes, then makes more sense....otherwise you are paying a high premium just for the upmarket area."
January 2015,"Wonderful stay, beautiful hotel","I stayed here for a couple of weeks in September and December, as well as over a weekend in October. Every stay has been wonderful. I love the hotel's central location - it's really near Harvey Nichols and Harrods, but is nestled in a quiet area along Pont Street, so it doesn't feel like you're staying someplace busy. The hotel itself is beautiful and contemporary, with an excellent restaurant that serves modern British cuisine focused on seafood. I have multiple allergies, and despite my fussy diet the restaurant staff accommodated my requests without problems. The front desk handled my reservations very well, and the concierge were friendly and helpful with everything. I had fallen ill during my stay, and the concierge helped me to arrange a visit from the doctor, which was…"
January 2015,Good hotel in plush upmarket area,"I have stayed in many 5 star properties in both London & around the world and although a lovely hotel I have to stay it is not quite up there with other 5 star establishments. I booked the break for my Birthday and although mentioning the occasion in an email prior to my stay there was no additional touches in the room like a card or cake to wish me happy birthday which is something other hotels, even 4 star have executed very well in the past. The concierge were dressed in jeans and checkered shirts which although matched the cool laid back vibe of the hotel I found it too casual and scruffy for a hotel of the 5 star calibre. The concierge were polite but I did not find them friendly and they did not look like they wanted to be there. Also in the evening I asked if they could…"
November 2014,stylish hotel in great location,"had a great stay! very stylish interior, rooms are not oversized but ok, great service throughout the place, perfect location for business and shopping and a very good hotel bar. I really enjoyed my visit!"
December 2014,Great Hotel- Great Service,"This review is for a stay a couple of months ago, that I had with my boyfriend but I just wanted to write a review due to the absolutely exceptional service we received- free upgrade, room was spacious and luxurious- We couldn't have asked for more. The hotel concierge service, bar and staff were friendly and professional. No complaints.   Thank you very much- We will hopefully be back and will recommend to friends."
December 2014,Great little boutique,"Great location tucked away in a beautiful neighborhood. I like the fact that it's not in a hotel zone and it's a few short blocks from Harrod's. Our room was on the small side but hey, it's London, with the bathroom being above average. We didn't have any view to speak of, we overlooked some mechanical units on a roof-top but I still liked the over-all vibe of the hotel. The bar area on the second floor was great to come back to for a nite-cap. I would definitely recommend this hotel, great value for the price."
December 2014,Torn between giving it 3 or 4 stars...,"I travel to London regularly and always like to stay at different hotels to explore new areas. The Belgraves is located between posh Sloane Square and Knightsbridge, a very pretty and residential area with plenty of high-end shopping opportunities. It was certainly nice to see what the streets of Belgravia are like but it wasn’t exactly our cup of tea for a 4-night stay. We found that there was a lack of restaurants, cafés and breakfast opportunities around. Of course you’re walking distance from Heston Blumenthal’s dinner, Gordon Ramsay or Petrus but it’s not like we can afford to dine at Michelin-starred restaurants 4 nights in a row. I guess this was sort of expected though, so we weren’t disappointed about the location. However, next time we would choose a more lively area…"
December 2014,Good value,"Well situated and a short walk from knightsbridge high street, it's a typical Thompson hotel. Small and well decorated. We had a room on the 2nd floor which wasn't great as it looked onto the hotel roof scattered with Air-conditioning equipment but it was not really an issue as we didn't spend much time there. The bathroom is small but does have an excellent rain forest shower. Worth a stay for a quick in and out of London."
November 2014,"Great hotel, great location",Stay in Knightsbridge several times a year and have tried most of the hotels here.  Really impressed with Belgraves.  Understated but impeccable service and excellent rooms / amenities.   Let me check in early following an early arrival from the U.S. as well without any drama.
November 2014,Absolutley bang on,"This hotel is in the heart of Knightsbridge - it comes with a certain price and a certain expectation.  When we get over the cost (this is not a cheap hotel) then we can really enjoy all that it has to offer. From our arrival, screeching to a halt at the main entrance - the valet took away the car, the concierge took away our luggage, and we were checked in swiftly and efficiently.   The hotel is immaculate, the rooms are immaculate and the bathroom/wet room is to die for.  We only stayed one night - a dirty weekend in the capital.  But oh-my-days, it was worth it.   If you are looking for a top-end facility, then I urge you to book a stay here."
December 2014,A fantastic find- will be back,"My friend and I spent 3 nights here on a shopping trip to London. The location was perfect and the hotel was also perfect, from the lovely staff to the great food and drink and the smoking terrace. Could not have asked for a better place, so nice to stay in a smaller more cosy and friendly hotel compared to some of the larger ones we have stayed in the past. Look forward to our next stay."
December 2014,A great hotel with a good location,"This was a lovely hotel that a friend and I stayed at this month. It is very clean and the staff are helpful, friendly and attentive.  The rooms are a good size (we were given a handicap accessible room), so I can't comment on a typical room.  Except for spotty wifi service throughout the hotel (at no extra charge), I really enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay there again. The location is nice and quiet, midway between the Knightsbridge and Sloan Square stations (each is a 7-10 minute walk).  Many bus lines are a couple blocks away on the main road, but we didn't try to use them.  We used the concierge sevhce to book a day trip to Stonehenge and were very pleased. "
December 2014,Fantastic,"I took my wife to the Belgraves Hotel for our first anniversary, a fact I mentioned to the lady in reservations when booking. Upon arriving at the hotel we were congratulated on our anniversary and upgraded to the Penthouse Suite. To say we were blown away with the room would be an understatement. We had a separate living room with views over London (London Eye, Big Ben, the Shard etc) two bathrooms (one of which had the most marvellous shower I have ever seen) and a bedroom with a massive and comfortable bed and access to the balcony.   A bottle of champagne was brought up to our room (which was included with the promotion we booked) but also included was a card congratulating us on our anniversary which was very thoughtful.   The hotel itself is very cool, not at all stuffy.…"
November 2014,Another great stay at belgraves,"I had the pleasure to stay again at belgraves, the team are all so helpful and it has a great relaxed vibe, the rooms are really Modern, spotlessly clean and really could not ask for any more from a london hotel, the turn down service was perfect leaving ice and bottled water for my return and the restaurant in the hotel is also very nice. Hope to stay again soon, thank you "
April 2014,Modern boutique hotel ,"This hotel is where the trendy people in London meet for a drink. The food menu in the bar area is generally good as well as their drinks. The hotel rates are reasonable as the hotel is situated in a very upscale part of London. It's walking distance from sloane street, sloane square and kings road. A great boutique option in the SW area. "
March 2014,Excellent hotel...total luxury!,"We have just spent a night at the hotel and was quite simply perfect!  Service (even before we arrived) was exceptional.  The hotel is über stylish and located in the heart of Belgravia, londons most exclusive area.  It's within easy access to the luxury Knightsbridge and Chelsea shops and restaurants and not to far to walk to Mayfair and the west end.  The rooms are luxurious with Hughes comfy beds!   Food and drink were excellent and would recommend the Pont St restaurant. Excellent fish restaurant but certainly not limited to seafood.    Would thoroughly recommend...a real 5star hotel!"
March 2014,It's all about service,"From start to finish of a three night stay we received really first class service - every member of staff is friendly and they are all keen to make your stay feel special. When you add this to very well designed rooms, a truly comfortable bed and an excellent buffet breakfast, what more can you say? If I try to look for a couple of slightly critical comments, maybe some of the staff in the breakfast room could try to break into a smile more frequently and why were all the clocks on the lift showing incorrect times? But that is really being pedantic - well done to the team at a really well run hotel."
April 2014,excellent,"""I’ll start by saying that I am well traveled and have stayed in my fair share of high-end hotels across the world.  With that said, I am truly impressed and beyond satisfied with the service I have received at the Belgrave Hotel in London.   This hotel ranks high as far as its location and overall cleanliness.  However,  what makes this establishment a real gem, is the amazing staff and  their impeccable customer service.  The personnel was very welcoming and beyond accommodating, not only to myself, but to the entire group (of 8) I traveled with. They were one of the most genuine and wholehearted staff I have encountered, and this made for a very pleasant experience.   I HIGHLY recommend the Belgrave Hotel and it’s top-notch staff."""
March 2014,Lovely!,"We stayed there 2 nights.  They arranged a baby cot as soon as I mentioned about our stay with an infant. The room was not big enough to get in with the stroller, we had to leave it at the front desk which did not bother me at all.  The hotel is located perfect for shopping, near Harrods and Harvey Nichols, and many more stores! Also there is Waitrose (Grocery store) nearby and it is convenient to get an extra goods if needed.  Hotel staff is kind enough, you will get average nice service.  Breakfast was quite good with the choice of healthy juice such as green smoothies and so on!  We have got this hotel by hotwire, and we were satisfied for what we paid for.   Nice to feel Posh area of London."
March 2014,Service! It makes all the difference.,"Europe is not known for its service (by North American standards, anyway); I know because I have lived in Europe and in general the service is not high quality. EXCEPT at Belgraves. The service at this hotel is outstanding and very genuine. I so appreciated all the staff: the doorman/porter, front desk, maintenance, restaurant staff, and concierge. Everyone I encountered was delightful and really engaging. It made my stay in London wonderful.   The hotel itself is also wonderful if you like small boutique properties. It is set in a lovely neighborhood and is decorated very tastefully; an easy place to relax. Rooms are small to average size (it is Europe) and very comfortable. The ONLY constructive criticism that I have is that the sound proofing is not adequate . . . I was privy…"
March 2014,Exquisite!,Top tier professional talent all of whom deserve a round of applause.  Great venue but it's the staff that raises the bar even  higher.  Highly recommended for the business or vacation traveler.  Neighborhood is lovely as well.
March 2014,Average,"We stayed here this weekend and liked the design and atmosphere, the room however was still not so big for it's type and there was no isolation towards the hallway resulting in everything being heard crystal clear both ways. Sure the design was nice, but that did not make up for the fact that our sense of privacy was gone nor did it make up for the lack of running water on our day of check-out which was not event compensated for by the hotel."
March 2014,We loved it!,"My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel for two nights during a brief stay in London.  We loved it! We are relatively frequent travellers, and were thoroughly impressed with this hotel. I don't have anything negative to say about it.  It was hip and stylish without being overly pretentious, very well designed, comfortable, etc.  We loved the bathroom, and also loved the little window seat in the bedroom.    I had read other reviews about the location not being good, but for us it was perfect.  South of Knightsbridge and north of Sloan stations, it is within walking distance of upscale gastropubs and cafes, close enough to walk interesting places and within easy access to transportation.    Finally, the service was top knotch. We were so impressed with every single person…"
March 2014,5 star rating reflective of my experience,"This being a Thompson hotel its similar in concept to many others I've stayed at. Ultra-modern clean finishes etc. the lobby is intimate some would find it a little cramped but its a minor point of observation. Staff were very attentive, we got a room upgrade at check in which may be biasing my review since the entry level rooms are much smaller (typical European sizes). The room itself it fully furnished with every conceivable modern amenity. Love the built in US/EU/UK plugs a minor but welcomed convenience. For a suite it is not my ideal layout. I would prefer a decent dining table (or at least a table suitable for dining on) to a large lounge and a larger bathroom with a tub. Aesthetic is very clean with extra wide hard wood paneling adorning the floors and walls."
October 2013,Perfect!!!,"My Husband and I stayed at the Belgraves last night for his 30th Birthday. From the moment we stepped foot into the hotel we we're impressed. The concierge was fantastic, likewise were the receptionists. We stayed in a studio king suite which they had kindly upgraded us to and it was amazing. They had even put a birthday cake in the room! The room was spacious and we had a bath tub that over looked the gardens. I would highly recommend it to anyone, you won't be disappointed. It is the best place we have ever stayed!!!"
September 2013,Rafael nadal can sure make a drink,"I have already written a review for this bar before, but I felt it necessary to write one again. I have drunk in many bars in London, but the bar at belgraves really stands out. The rafa nadal lookalike behind the bar made me a drink called the hot buffalo and it was amazing, just eh thing to pick me up. Can't recommend it enough. Thank you and I will see you again soon."
October 2013,One Night wasn't enough,"This hotel has blown my mind. Not only is the art and style of this hotel mod and sheek, it has the staff at the front to embellish it even further. Every contact with a front desk or the bell person was   just satisfying as they knew what I was looking for, or what I wanted or what I should be getting for that matter. They were very detailed oriented and paid attention to every ins and outs of that lobby.  I was upgraded for 1 night to one of their deluxe suites and my oh my... the room was unbelievable. The cleanliness, the details in fabric and light fixtures .... down to the coffee table ornaments were typical Thompson attitudes.   I did visit the Bar and terrace on the 1st floor... it was quiet but that's how I prefer my Martini and the Bartender gave me a few pointers for…"
October 2013,Top of  the line staff,"Front of the house personnel:    Sarah, Violetta, Camille and Magali;  Michael the bellman; everyone smiles; everyone has answers.  These people have been trained and trained well.  Room lighting was a problem; they brought in more lighting.  Air conditioner wasn't working that well;  an engineer was there in two minutes and when the equipment needed repair, they moved our room;  upgraded and immediate.  Rooms are on the small side overall design and service quality more than make up for  it. This place will be my new London hotel."
October 2013,"Great service, great drink list, great Bar!!!","I have been in the Bar at Belgraves just a couple days ago with some friends. The hotel looks amazing from the moment you walk in. We had a couple of drinks in the bar, and everything was great, lady that served us was very nice and polite with a smile on her face all the time, drink list is very good- everyone will find something good for them. I really would recommend!"
September 2013,home away from home,"I have been at Belgraves hotel many times, its Very cosy great hotel, staff is very friendly and helpful,they have amazing restaurant and bar you should try the burger at the restaurant its the best burger in town"
September 2013,Another Amazing Stay At The Belgraves,"Just had another 4 separate nights at The Belgraves.  What can I say, except to say, I was not disappointed again!  I booked my first night through a booking agency here in Australia and there was some confusion so immediately the Duty Manager called me in Sydney to rectify the situation and upgraded my room for the following weeks stay.  When I returned the following week, I again had been upgraded to a suite!  The staff are amazing and considerate, nothing is too much trouble for them.  Mauritzio, the Concierge is very accommodating and will go out of his way to help you with anything that you need.  The girls on the front desk are also fabulous, Cammie is my favourite though, extremely thorough and professional.  The boys at the front door to welcome you are also a nice touch…"
October 2013,Great experience!,"I have been at belgraves with my parents just a couple of days ago. It was a recommendation of one of my friends and I have to say it was amazing!! The staff was very friendly, specially the Italian waiter who served us on the terraces was fantastic in recommending drinks and cigars. The cocktails taste amazing and the atmosphere is very relaxing! All in all a perfect place to start or end a exiting day out in London ! Well done! We will be back soon."
September 2013,A bad experience,"A friend and I were enjoying a birthday treat in London, en route elsewhere we decided to enjoy a relaxing glass of wine in a nice environment, however our experience at this hotel was disappointing.  When we arrived at the bar there was no-one there to serve us.After waiting a while a lady arrived and took our order. There were no- other customers in the bar.  After waiting 15 minutes we had to return to remind her, our drinks arrived some 5 minutes or more later, but there was no apology.  Whilst the surroundings of the hotel were very pleasant, it was a shock to receive a bill for £27.00 inc 12.5% service when we had had no service at all, we will not be returning there for 2 glasses of wine at these prices and no service"
July 2013,Excellent stay,"This hotel delivers excellence in every area from friendly staff  especially doormen who clearly take pride of the hotel and always greet you by name. Well appointed rooms, superbly cooked and present meal if you choose to dine at the hotel. I would happily stay here again!"
June 2013,its a starting hotel fantastic location but can do better still,"We loved our experience at thompson les NYC, so we continued our trip to london in the same brand but unluckily management was different at london. Location is fabulous, super chic, between embassies. elegant, classy. walking distance to the parks and major attractions. beautifull to just go out anywere and walk.  Hotel decoration was cool, trendy, brand new. restaurant and in room dining very poor. sugestion a kids menu or healthy option not a friendly hotel for travelling with babies. though staff was allways super friendly there is not ramp for stroller and elevators are really small and no kids menu. its more a couple or friends going out hotel not for business neither as internet never worked in room in the whole week we stayed. Not even the payed expensive internet. My…"
May 2013,Fantastic Hotel,"Having stayed at the Roosevelt in LA and The Thompson in NY, I know this chain, so was keen to try The Belgraves.  I booked directly from Sydney and spoke to a delightful French girl called Camille.  She was the first person I met when I arrived at 6am on a Wednesday morning.  From the moment I walked into the hotel, nothing is too much trouble for this groovy, young, but very professional group of staff.  Everyone remembers your name from reception, down to the young guys at the main entrance.  The two young waitresses in the bar are just a delight and everyone has a really friendly demeanour about them. I opted for the Deluxe room and wasn't disappointed, although I stayed in one with only a shower for the first week, the second one had a bath, which I preferred.  My room had…"
June 2013,Perfect Hotel,"We really enjoyed the stay and every detail of the hotel. The hotel is located very central and close to almost everything, but situated at a calm spot. I can fully recommend the hotel and the location."
June 2013,wonderful week at Belgraves,"Greeted with smiles by everyone,my husband and I felt welcomed and comfortable from Day 1.Concierge and staff made arrangements,suggestions and gave info that made our week flow flawlessly. Delightful morning breakfast started our day of sightseeing and we returned to the Belgraves to relax in the stylish lounge over drinks and enjoy wonderful nights sleep. The quiet elegance of Belgravia added to the overall atmosphere. The staff's attentiveness, professionalism and friendliness truly made staying at Belgraves and our week in London memorable."
June 2013,Hotel Excellence,"Belgraves is a perfect example of excellence.  From the crisp, clean and contemporary decor through to the clear customer orientated team, we can highly recommend.  My husband and I visited recently for a weekend to celebrate our wedding anniversary and it was a fantastic experience from beginning to end.  The staff are very friendly and personable without being insincere or intrusive, this balance can be difficult and they had it just right.  The suite was perfect.  The space was nicely laid out, plenty of room to move around, the views through two aspects were incredible and the bed very comfortable."
July 2012,"Funky hotel, young staff, great location, small rooms","Ive stayed in this hotel on business and for a romantic anniversary. For business I wouldn't really recommend it but otherwise it is a great hotel with the following benefits: - incredible location  - good value for its proximity to things - friendly staff - views are nice if you ask for the higher floors - funky hotel lounge/bar with a great outside terrace - good food at hotel restaurant/room service  Disadvantages: - rooms are small (dont be fooled by the way they name each room. i.e. standard room is called ""King Superior"") - they charge for internet!!! - not very generous (we were celebrating our anniversary and they had promised to take care of us, i did not get an upgrade nor any gift, bottle of wine, roses, chocolate, nothin!!) - they add service charges on your final…"
May 2013,Fav hotel in London!,"After staying in hotels all over London this is my very, very favorite! I love the small cozy feel of this hotel and its rooms.  The hotel is also located in Belgravia, which quickly became my favorite area of London.  Belgravia is not only beautiful on its own (surrounded by gorgeous white homes, unique boutiques, cute little restaurants), it is also just a quick walk to Knightsbridge (where Harrods and other high-end shops are located) and Buckingham Palace.  The rooms are a bit small (typical for Europe), but very comfortable....and not to mention, the bathrooms are gorgeous. Also very clean and new rooms...felt like an American hotel with a European soul.  Everyone at the hotel was very helpful -- great at recommending restaurants and activities.    Quick tips:  1.…"
May 2013,"Small, but Well Appointed and Luxurious","After many years of staying at the St. Martins Lane, I decided to give the Belgraves a chance, given that it is close to my office.   I was surprised by just how small the property was when I arrived, but what it lacks in size, it makes up in service and comfort.   Tucked away in the middle of upscale Belgravia, the location is short walk from Sloan Sq. and Victoria tubes, as well as a number of cute neighborhood bars, restaurants, coffee shops and pubs.  The service here was extremely warm and helpful.  There is always someone around to help you and they are on top of their game without being too overbearing.   The standard rooms are small, but typical by London standards.  I was impressed to see that they were able to fit in a sitting area, desk and queen sized bed while still…"
February 2013,My favourite London hotel,"I have been to London several times, but this is definately my favourite hotel now. The service is great, the hotel interior is stylish, but not too ""designed"" with a warm and friendly atmosphere. The location close to Knightsbridge and Sloane Square could not be better. And above all i never slept so good before. These beds are a dream! Thanks to the whole staff for a wonderful stay!"
May 2013,"Chic, Modern Luxury","Stayed in this hotel for two nights at the end of February, and was glad to have picked it. It is definitely a five-star hotel, without being stuffy.The service was fantastic, the staff were polite and attentive but not snobbish. The hotel has a nice atmosphere - it is trendy and chic - but also relaxed. Our room was clean, light and spacious (for London). It had an enormous shower with an overhead ""rainshower"" function, which was great.  Location wise it is around a 10 minute walk to the King's road so it is a great location but it is very quiet at night for central london. Hopefully we will be back soon!"
July 2013,Much too expensive compared to what you get....,"Stayed in this hotel for the first time this weekend and I´m not impressed.....  My husband came a day earlier and was told that his only card was not working (this card was used all over London the whole week....) When I came the next day I wasn´t even greeted before I was asked for my credit card to pay my husbands bill. (the other nights were prepaid) My husband felt treated like a criminal..  So to the hotel itself. Positives: Very good location, nice bar. Negatives: Tiny rooms, nothing extra (no coffee/tea etc), cheap quality small towels. Out of our three nights we had a turn-down service once! One evening (they came 18.30) we asked them to come back in an hour (they did not) and next evening they did not show up at all... This happened also to our friends in next room. …"
July 2013,"Bar at Belgraves, a good time had by all.","My friends were taking me out for my Birthday, and they brought me to the belgraves hotel bar, which is a very stylish bar indeed.   the staff recommended we sat around in the snug they called it. a great place for small group.  the staff were excellent and efficient. the selection of whiskeys were among the best i had seen, and several of them went down beautifully.  the onion and balsamic popcorn they give out was amazing, the truffle one were not im afraid to say.  All in all a lovely little bar and i will be returning, mainly due to the friendlessness of the waitresses."
July 2013,"Liked everything about it, and will go back soon.","My wife and I stayed at Belgraves last weekend while passing through London.  We had stayed in (and liked) the prior hotel at this address, but had not come since Belgraves opened.  This is an excellent, thoroughly modern hotel whose staff members are cordial, capable, and eager to provide go service.  On arrival, we needed a good bit of assistance, which desk and lobby staff provided promptly.  Things worked as they should throughout our stay.  Our room was altogether comfortable.  We had a pleasant view of Belgravia Square.  We ate two breakfasts in the hotel, both excellent and both well served.  London is never inexpensive, but Belgraves' prices seemed fair to us, and consistent with the market.  We will go back soon."
June 2013,Unexpectedly cool,"Stylish and sophisticated in this previously staid corner of Belgravia, this Hotel covers all the bases. The rooms are chic and sleek. The interior design is contemporary yet comfortable. The beds are sleep inducing and I cannot wait to come and stay again. Breakfast was delicious too, by the way. I have never seen such an extensive menu at that time in the morning! Welcoming staff for whom nothing is too much trouble."
July 2013,Loved the Hotel,"Let me start with saying i LOVE Thompson hotels  and the Belgraves was no exception. Wonderful ambiance, the entire staff was very nice and helpful, room service is typically quick, fun bar/lounge upstairs... food was delicious weather it was room service or in their restaurant.  Everyone greets you hello and is quick to ask if you need anything.  It's a little bit of a walk to the tube (closest is Knightsbridge) but it's in a great location, pubs around, lots of great (expensive!) shopping. Loved the electronic blinds and they do a wonderful turndown service.  Would stay again and they definitely add that nice personal touch during your stay. Would definitely return."
June 2013,Their Staff May My Stay,"Having stayed at hotels around the world, I'm often surprised by the lack of interest that many hotel staff show in their customers and in their profession. No such problem at Belgraves, the team from the front desk, restaurant, bar and events team were amazing - great personalities, top of their game.  The hotel was comfortable, well set and felt like home. I was there for a meeting and we couldn't have asked for more from the events team. Thanks to everyone for making our stay memorable."
April 2013,"Great location, everything else is average","4 point review: -You cant beat the location, right in the center of town a short cab ride from victoria and a short walk to Hyde Park.  -The rooms are small (even by city standards) and I was quite surprised by how low the ceiling is! The bed is comfy and there is really nothing else of note in the room. No tea/coffee maker  -The service levels are good, I do think they did get stuck in between trying to seem very young & funky and at the same time keeping up traditional standards of service. Dont think they have got their act together yet - One annoying bit, everytime I ordered room service the would commit for 20 minute delivery time (which is very fast) but would end up delivering in 30-40 minutes which is normal. Why make the promise if you consistently fail?"
June 2013,Good job,"I stayed at Belgraves for one solid week in April for an event. I also booked some friends there at the same time for greater convenience. They gave me a great room with a view, the service was excellent. It's got a buzzy hotel lobby with switched-on staff. While they showed me no price flexibility, they really delivered the goods and I would be happy to go back. Unbeatable location, minutes from Sloane street."
June 2013,Top dollar location...shame about hotel,Stunning location...just behind eaton sq not far to harrods....elegant boutique type of place...trendy...porters wear ranch hand type of clothes...nice staff at reception.....room very nice but dark...down lighters had been blanked over making it impossible to get made up etc....window blind wouldn't stay up which didn't help light situation...shower door made terrible cracking noise...very alarming...no tea/coffee facilities ...no water provided after first night...room not turned down on second night and not even made on day three...window would not shut...keeping you awake at night...wifi £15/25 per day...please we are in 21 st century....bar shut sat night for private function...the only bar....no breakfast included..grand total £1454 for a bed....how can they justify…
June 2013,Boutique possibly at its best,"I stayed at the Belgraves last week for work and thoroughly enjoyed my stay based mainly on the service provided by the staff. Upon check-in, I was provided with a thorough description of the hotel's amenities and benefits in a way that encouraged me to feel very welcome. I even received a follow up phone call about 30 minutes after check-in to confirm that everything in my room was to my liking. Throughout my stay, I was greeted by my last name and asked about how my day was going or if I needed any additional assistance.   The room itself had all of the little touches that you would expect at a great hotel, including an fine REN toiletries, high threat count towels and bedding. The wifi and in-room technology (tv, stereo, lighting) worked consistently without fail and was…"
February 2013,Excellent Choice in Prime London Area,"This is a very nice hotel in the Westminster area. Clean, modern & efficient. Comfortable rooms, however, are rather sparsely appointed. Convenient to many embassies, Hyde Park & government offices. Top notch restaurant (reviewed separately). Good breakfast. Great staff. "
February 2013,Best ever,"Stayed here at  the beginning of February when I took my husband to London for his birthday. It was top class. The hotel is crisp and clean, the bedrooms are very spacious, the decor is superb, the staff were polite and attentive and made the stay even more enjoyable. Would recommend this hotel to anyone, I will be staying here again that's for sure."
December 2012,Chic boutique hotel in a great location,"What a wonderful stay we had here in London! Very centrally located, just 3-5 mins walk to Knightsbridge metro, and London cabs are always available throughout our stay. The hotel is tucked away at a quaint corner so there is no noises from traffic, pubs or crowds. There is also a Jeeves dryclean store and a Jeroboams (wine store) just across the road.  We were most impressed by the hotel's wonderful service staff - from the reception, concierge and the housekeeping team. The concierge team (by a very nice gentleman whom I cannot remember his name) helped us with lunch reservations at a very chic restaurant Hakkasan. All the staff was very friendly and could remember our names.  The room was very big and spacious, very well kept and very clean. Comes with Ren bath shower…"
February 2013,Boutique Chique,"This hotel is funky, modern and very cool. I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone visiting London. It's in a great location. We were visiting for a special occasion and champagne was left in our room which was a very thoughtful touch. Loved the window sofas!"
January 2013,super nice bar and great location,"the hotel is located only 1 min walk from sloane street ( harvey nichols / harrods on brompton road ) and sloane square which is close to kings road, both very nice shopping areas. the rooms are rather small but very nicely furnished and perfect for a weekend trip. i love coming to the bar upstairs which is a nice place to have a tea in the afternoon ( their tea selection and pastries are delicious ) or a drink in the evening. for people who are looking for a very lively hotel i would not recommend to stay here because it is rather small compared to the big chain hotels and very cozy. if you are looking for a bar where you can actually enjoy a talk and understand what the other person is saying then you will love this place, if you like a loud and vibrant atmosphere then better…"
January 2013,Little gem of a hotel.,"This was my second stay at Belgraves, a Thompson hotel in London. It once again exceeded all expectations and made my stay London as lovely as ever.  I prefer small, intimate hotels (am familiar with the Thompson hotels in NYC)  or atleast that feel like that with personal attention and accomodation. The staff here is wonderful and always aim to please. The rooms are gorgeous, contemporary yet inviting and warm, from the linens to the wall decor ( we had a great photograph of Julieanne Moore scantily clad) to the bathroom design I love it. The bar dowstairs ( above lobby) is also definitly worth seeing and having a tea or drink. We received an upgrade and had a beautiful view over Chesham place all the way to the Thames and had the privilage of seeing a gorgeous full moon light…"
January 2013,Great location and look forward to returning,"Nice hotel in great location. Would definitely return. Rooms are stylish, modern and very comfortable.  Bathroom was small but well designed with good shower  Helpful staff.  Bar was welcoming and breakfast was especially nice"
January 2013,Smiling Staff,Had a nice long weekend vacation with smiling staff and quality service.  Service at the front office and the Room service runs smoothly. We enjoyed the breakfast as well as the Bar. Smoking Terrace at the bar is appriciated by the smokers.
January 2013,lovely stay,"We were made to feel so welcome. It was our anniversary and we received a complimentary upgrade and champagne bought to the room.  the room was lovely, comfortable and clean. I love how the bathroom lights can turn blue so that in the middle of the night you dont have to turn the light on. so clever and would be great in all hotels.  To put it simply we had a lovely stay, and would definitely stay here again.   I appreciate how special they made us feel."
January 2013,Discrete and great value boutique hotel in Knightsbridge/Chelsea,"Belgraves is a recently re-furbished (I believe February 2011) boutique hotel occupying the site of the former Sheraton Belgravia (I think!). On arrival, the staff were totally charming and enthusiastic. My room was great - comfortable, spacious, stylish - everything looked and felt brand new. The gym was also very good and well-equipped. Location is Chelsea/Knightsbridge - around a ten minute walk to Knightsbridge or Sloane Square tube stations. The breakfast offering was a total disconnect to the rest of the hotel offering - poor quality produce and generally inferior - which needs to be improved. Barring the breakfast, I though Belgraves was great - ideal for the discerning traveller - and also excellent value compared to many four star hotels in London."
April 2012,Sublime weekend,"My wife and I have had the pleasure of staying in some of London's finest hotels. We discovered this beautiful and charming hotel through Jetsetter.com and will definitely be staying here again. Im not sure which room type we stayed in, my wife took care of that, but the room was luxurious, spacious, and emanated a sense of warmth. The small seated alcove near the window was superb.  The lobby which seems to be spread over two floors gave the same impression of warmth, luxury but also fun, with large Taschen photo books strategically placed.   To top this off, the staff and service was excellent, the staff were meticulous, from remembering names, not easy in my case, but also bending over backwards to make us feel welcomed and to see to our needs.   A fantastic hotel, I would…"
August 2012,Good deal,Stayed for 3 days while attending the London Book Fair. Very nice newly opened hotel so all the interior is very modern. The rooms are not very big but very well laid out and look great. The beds and mattresses are very comfortable. Bar and lounge area look great and the outdoor smoking area is very well designed which is very unusual. Breakfast was good. The location for my purpose was not good but overall it´s fine. Bought the stay on www.jetsetter.com and it was a great deal for a 4/5 star hotel. Would not buy at the regular rate but for what I paid it was great.
November 2012,"Service, Service, and More Service!!!!","We stayed at the Belgraves Hotel for 8 days and 7 nights for the Olympics. It is located in the heart of Knightsbridge, one of the most exclusive areas in London. We had reserved a car to pick us up but they were late and could not find us.  So we took a cab which turned out to be the cab ride from hell from Heathrow. To say the least, my husband and I were not in a great mood to begin our hotel stay given a long flight from the U.S. coupled with the cab incident.  We arrived about 10 am at the hotel and were greeted by two very nice young doormen. They took our luggage from the cab and open the door to the hotel for us.  This was the beginning of a very wonderful stay.   From the time we set foot in the hotel until the day we left, we were treated like royalty. The concierge…"
October 2012,You will enjoy your stay,Best concierge service you will get in a hotel.  Great location. Quiet.  Rooms are not the biggest but they have the Best beds. Friendly staff.  You feel home. Once you stay here you will want to come back.
October 2012,Great hotel!,"The hotel offered excellent service and a very pleasent stay, defientely a hotel to try if you havn't and I will be returning shortly. The staff were excellent and really tried to make sure your needs were catered for. Great US serrvice in the heart of London!"
October 2012,a memorable stay at the Belgraves,"This is by far the best hotel we have stayed in in London! Welcoming and helpful staff from arrival to departure, well appointed rooms with excellent facilities (the shower is to die for!) and the most comfortable bed ever.... It is in a side street which means a quiet and peaceful night ahead... What else can I say except go and see for yourself, you will not be disappointed! And another thing..it was a special occasion for me and my partner and we were upgraded to a studio suite! It has never happened to us before in London!"
October 2012,Shelter from the Storm,Great Hotel. Staying here a few nights as our layover turned into an open ended stay thanks to Hurricane Sandy! But not to fret. We made the right call by booking a suite at Belgraves and are really enjoying the place. The staff is attentive and neat. The rooms are well appointed. The shower is AWESOME! Only complaint is the daily Internet access fee....no worries we have 3G.
October 2012,A jewel of a hotel,"This hotel has much to commend it, including great location, design and friendly employees, particularly the very eager, welcoming bell staff. It's not inexpensive -- and the approximately $22 daily charge for internet service was ridiculous -- but the overall value is pretty good. Plus, the showers are phenomenal, with awesome water pressure, stable temperatures and intuitive controls."
October 2012,Amazing Luxury Stay at The Belgraves,"I have never written a review on TripAdvisor, but my stay at Belgraves, forced me to have to write one. I had the most amazing stay at the Thompson Hotel. Unbelievably great service from check in to check out. From Julian at the door who personally addressed me every time I entered and exited the hotel, to the other staff at the door, to the front desk staff, to the concierge, I literally couldn't have asked for any better service. I communicated a proposal would be happening during my trip, and they made us feel so comfortable and took care of us more than I could have ever imagined. We were sent a complimentary bottle of champagne on the first night, and the room they placed us in was amazing. We purchased a King Premium room, and it was great. It featured a nice foyer area,…"
October 2012,Just perfect,"Attentive staff, well designed rooms, the room was 'pin drop quiet' and the bed was a bed 'to die for'.  Belgraves really does define a boutique hotel.  Combined with its quiet residential setting in one if the most beautiful sections of London's Belgravia, this hotel is great!"
February 2012,Cool ambiance and strong service; a couple small details missing for five stars,"I booked Belgraves via Tablet, and got a cheaper rate than the Thompson Hotels website, just as an FYI for other travelers. The hotel is very chic, with strong service. From the bell staff who met me at the cab to the front desk staff, everyone was very helpful (almost too much so - I only had a small bag and they insisted on bringing it up to my room for me). The rooms are well appointed, but as other reviewers have said, not all that large - although in line with other London accommodations. The bed was comfortable and linens fresh. Although small, I appreciated that the a la carte breakfast prices were not astronomical, and that there was actually a wide selection of a la carte items, even for the room service breakfast - you didn't have to buy a $20 meal. The two nits I had…"
February 2012,"Lovely Stay at The Belgraves, A Thompson Hotel","A lovely boutique hotel in the Belgravia area, London. I arrived on the opening day of the hotel opening on 1st Feb at 10am, We Received a very warm welcome by Nikkolas and the front desk staff, i booked a King Premium room which i did like when i walked inside.I was only there for a short 2 night stay with my wife and so gladly happy i chose the Belgraves, Room was very nice and cosy but small but i was satisfied, i chose the walk in shower bathroom as requested and my request was granted. Only thing was the bathroom was very small but then again you don't expect them to break it up and rebuild for you. Overall how the bathroom looked i was a satisfied guest. The Decor was very nice, The marble bathroom was nice along with the amenities. most of the time i used the room service…"
November 2012,New and well worth trying,"I was really impressed by this hotel. Everything smells new and the staff are just settling in, but it's a total WOW. Outstanding design, wonderful use of glass in all areas, and rooms that deliver everything you need when on business in London. Not cheap, but I am thinking of treating my wiife to a weekend there. It's special."
November 2012,Great experience,"I had a wonderful experience during a one week stay at Belgraves! Team is friendly and helpful, bar and restaurant are excellent and the decor is beautiful and extremelly confortable. Location is great!"
November 2012,a beautiful discovery,"a wonderful long weekend at the Belgraves; the staff were a real pleasure. eager to help, and pleasant all through. it is not very common these days to have a team from reception, to concierge as well as the team at the Bar and Lounge, to be all in complete sync in terms of freidliness and eager to please!! great location at the heart of London whether you are visiting for business, pleasure or shopping! highly recommendable."
November 2012,A very nice hotel.,"This hotel is filled with helpful accommodating staff who will assist you with every need. The room was clean and comfortable  and the food in the restaurant was fantastic. A very modern hotel in a nice part of London, a very pleasant stay."
November 2012,Fantastic hotel with wonderful (and very helpful) staff!,I thoughly enjoyed my stay at the Belgraves hotel. Very modern rooms (with no carpet which is a 10/10 in my view!). The staff are very accomodating. Great location/very central if you know the city. D.Bain
November 2012,"Modern Hotel, Amazing Service, Great Location","Coming from NYC, my wife and I had high expectations, as we've spent time at Thompson hotels there.  The Belgraves met and exceeded all of our expectations.  The hotel is modern, the staff were very friendly and helpfull, and it's in one of the best locations in London.  Within a few blocks of the hotel is some of the best shopping and restaurants the city has to offer.  I would highly recommend the Belgraves to any traveling to London, and look forward to staying with them again on my next trip."
November 2012,Great Experience,I booked a last minute London and have never been.  I did some research but not much due to time constraints.  I had a 12 hour flight and checked in exhausted.  The staff was extremely polite and professional the entire stay.  I sat down with the concierge for 30 minutes and she gave me so many options and keyed in on what she thought I would like.  Everyone on staff was nothing but helpful and made my first few days so easy.
October 2012,Great location and staff,"Great hotel, staff are exceptionally friendly and attentive, remembered by name the whole time.  Not cheap of course but you get what you pay for.  Good location close to about 3 tube stations.  Walking distance from Knightbridge and Hyde Park but the area itself it quite quiet.  Decor is superb, espcially in foyer.  Great lighting, nice carpets.  Bathroom is very well designed.  Nice fixture and fittings in the room.  Comfortable bed.  If I were being picky I would mention the specks of paint on the desk in the room that were out of kilt with everything else."
November 2012,Cool hotel in London,Stayed at Belgraves Hotel for one night (after enjoying a private reception at Buckingham Palace which is nearby).  Very friendly staff in all areas of the hotel.  It is a very cool hotel where I felt very welcome and relaxed.  Delicious dinner and breakfast in HIX.  Highly recommend and I shall return.
November 2012,Superior Service,"Although I am a fan of more traditional boutique hotels, I was very impressed with the Belgraves which has a 60s-ish New York-style vibe.  The service level is outstanding, the staff addressed me and my husband by our name, we were greeted every morning in the lobby and at the front door by the  young doormen in their cool plaid shirts and black jeans. Our room was very comfortable, clean, quiet despite its proximity to the lift, and the bed was heavenly. Check-in was courteous and helpful with a smile.  We are very frequent travelers and have stayed at the best hotels in the world. This new hotel is a success and should strive to maintain its service level which is the first quality all guests expect but unfortunately do not always encounter. My only criticism is the low…"
March 2012,New york cool in london!,"I cannot rate this hotel highly enough! I felt like i was in an uber cool hotel in new york!! Check in was quick and efficient, very friendly staff.. The doormen were excellent, the barmen amazing-cocktails were out of this world! The room was comfy and modern. Room service was great- prob one of the best ive ever had-our cooked breakfast was actually hot when it arrived still and tasty!! The whole stay was perfect and faultless and i will definitely be staying here again! Thank you very much to all the staff for making our stay so wonderful!"
March 2012,"Less than i expected, more than i bargained!","With high expectations and an inner need to feel relaxed and peaceful, we arrived at the hotel and immediately a crisp air of design and attention to detail blew us away. Since it was our anniversary, we were upgraded to a King Premium (from a King Deluxe), quite a welcome touch. Complimentary continental breakfast was included in the package, but more about breakfast in a while.   One point i wanna stress out is the fact that service is like any other. Everyone was extra polite, going the extra mile so as to satisfy any requests, most of the times before they were even expressed. So, many thumbs up for the best service we have experienced.   The hotel in question is completely renovated, something you cannot tell unless you focus on the exterior, which according to the hotel…"
March 2012,Nice updates but not what was expected,"We have stayed at this hotel in the past when it was a Sheraton and decided to try it again under the new brand as we really like the location. This hotel has gone through extensive renovations and is very nicely updated.  Before booking I emailed to confirm the Deluxe Double room could accommodate a family of 3 traveling together and was told it would be perfect for us it had two queen size beds.  Upon checking in we were disappointed to see it had two single beds, when I asked about this I was told I could upgrade to a suite for an additional £300 per night.  I declined.  The shower is a glass enclosure fully visible from everywhere in the room and offers no privacy making for an awkward situation when traveling with teenagers.  Although I will return to this hotel with my…"
March 2012,Great from start to finish,"From the time my wife and I walked through the large wooden front doors we were in awe... a fireplace burning, the bellman was eager to welcome us and a warm and inviting check in that took a little too long but the girl behind the counter couldn't have been nicer.  The staff were attentive throughout our stay (especially at concierge desk).  The rooms are very spacious and well appointed, especially the large bathroom with a great bathtub over looking the park. We had drinks at the bar which also took a while but well worth the wait.  Overall, great location with warm and friendly staff that made our weekend one to remember.  We will definitely go back!"
February 2012,Belgraves,"I want to preface this by saying that we received an e-mail saying that this hotel was suitable for families. We arrived and they had trouble checking us in but the staff was very good and we were given free drinks. Once we got to our room however, we realized that it was not family friendly. The first thing that we noticed was that it was two single beds, even though the e-mail said that it would be two queens. Next was probably the worst thing about the room and that was the shower. It was a two sided glass door. This meant that anyone lying in the beds or sitting on the couch could see the person in the shower. We eventually figured out that if all the lights were off in the bathroom and hallway all people could see was an outline. That was still less than ideal for a family.…"
March 2012,"Best location, lively","The Belgraves Hotel was opened on February the First, this year. Previously the Sheraton Belgravia, the asset has gone through extensive renovations. It was worth the wait.  The Hotel is comfortable, nice rooms, very good service and a reasonable price. We stayed there for 10 days and enjoyed it very much. The bed was superb. Have since recommended to friends and they, too, enjoyed. In contrast to the previous Sheraton, present owners have managed to inject a young and lively spirit to the hotel. The bar and restaurant are packed until late hours."
February 2012,Romantic and glamorous escape,"My wife and I stayed over the weekend. The location is great, just around the corner from Harvey Nichols, Harrods, Zuma, Kings Road, Hyde Park...The interior design is classy, intimate and subtle. The staff was very professional, helpful and dynamic. We loved our room, especially the bathroom with a great bathtub wrapped by the windows, giving a feeling of being suspended in the clouds...The energy in our room was very peaceful, we had a beautiful view on a garden. We shall be back, it's a great escape for a romantic weekend in London."
February 2012,Great boutique hotel in a wonderful location,"We stayed at the hotel a couple of weeks after it opened.  The hotel looked great -- very stylish and British modern.  We only had breakfast at the restaurant and it was tasty.  We had drinks at the bar on the second floor, which was cozy and a nice way to start the evening.  The rooms were fair-sized for London with good clothing storage.  The bathroom had a glass wall adjoining the bed which is ok for bringing in light but not good for privacy.  The bed, beddings and linen were all top notch.  There were a few issues to work out (check-in system a bit slow, hot water problem one morning, construction noise), but all the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  The location is amazing, close to so many things.  Would definitely stay there again."
February 2012,excellent service and friendly staff,"Stayed at the hotel over weekend. relaxed atmosphere and very helpfull staff.  rooms are little small but the staff makes it well worth staying here.  decor is good too, perfect location for business and pleasure that suited me well.  must mention Security officer who was friendly kind and escorted me to my room while i was back from party at night.  very professional staff and excellent atmosphere. will surely come back very soon  Al Sowail Bandar"
February 2012,Not ready as yet,Was recommended to stay disappointing hotel. Trying be different but Staff does not know what they are doing. Restaurant poor service. Lighting in rooms very dark at night.  I tried  to blow dry my  hair there are no nearby mirrors to see what u r doing. I took a shower no where in the bathroom to hang your bathrobe!
December 2023,Nice new hotel ..,Very nice decoration .. The staff are good .. I stayed on the hotel after two weeks from the opening .. The rooms are a bit small but they are nice .. 
October 2021,Fantastic hotel in great location!,"The Hari is a fantastic by hotel in a great location. Top notch service from everyone, great restaurant and room service, very clean and updated rooms. Location is perfect if you want to walk to Mayfair, Marylebone Hyde park and Sloan street shops. Would absolutely recommend!"
November 2023,The Hari is an undeniable Gem in Belgravia,"From the minute you step into this gorgeous boutique hotel, you feel very much at home. A cozy and modern hotel located in a beautiful neighbourhood, 10 minutes walk to Hyde Park, Harrods and KnightsBridge shopping district. The bed is extremely comfortable and the rooms are super clean. The staff are so lovely and welcoming especially Claudio at the front desk who made us feel right at home.  I have become a regular , and cant think of anywhere else better to stay at in London."
November 2023,Perfect London stay,"Second time staying here, it was just as amazing as the first time. Everyone working at the hotel is incredibly friendly and all are very attentive. The rooms are cozy and modern. And the hotel is located in a relatively convenient location despite London being generally difficult to get around when compared to NYC. HIGHLY recommend staying here if going to London on vacation or business!"
November 2023,A great first London visit,"The Hari, amenities and staff, was great. You couldn't ask for a better location, easy walking to plenty of shops, sights and restaurants as well as tube stations.  Our room was super comfortable with a very welcoming bed at the end of the day.  Don't neglect breakfast. Believe it or not the porridge is a thing as are the pancakes.  Thanks Hari!"
November 2023,Highly recommend this hotel,"I stay at the Hari quite regularly simply because I continue to have great experiences there. It's an excellent boutique hotel! Belgrave Place is a relatively quiet square but it's ideally located. The hotel is relaxing and the staff (many of whom have worked there for a number of years) are very friendly. They are also attentive and professional. Although not overly large (London, like many capital city hotel rooms typically aren't), the rooms are of high quality with stylish modern decoration. The beds are exceptionally comfortable and I always get a good nights sleep."
November 2023,Wonderful hotel!,"This was our first visit to The Hari. It won't be the last. The service was amazing... from the Front Desk to Guest Services to the door men. Everyone was so friendly.  I mentioned that it was my wife's birthday and they prepared the most fantastic balloons, cake and flowers - along with some lovely notes. It was such an unexpected - but wonderful surprise. Nobody could do enough. It really is a fantastic hotel. Highly recommend."
November 2023,Amazing service at the lounge and I would thank Angelica and Sergiu for their hospitality,"Their service is absolutely top-notch! The staff is friendly, attentive, and goes above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience and would especially thank Angelica and Sergiu. Whether you're enjoying a cup of coffee or indulging in their delicious menu, you can expect nothing but exceptional service. I highly recommend checking out The Hari Lounge for a memorable and enjoyable time! 🌟👌"

November 2023,The hari visit.,"Very beautiful bar. Great place for a gathering, amazing, quick service. Would definitely visit again.  The staff were very helpful. And the lounge was very nice. The atmosphere in general was just excellent.   The food and coffee were delectable."
December 2023,Great Hotel to Saty,I have stayed recently at The Hari and it was my first time vesting London. The staff are very friendly and CLARA​ LEFRANC Guest Relations Manager is an amazing person who shared special wishes with me and celebrated by birthday.  
October 2021,Fantastic hotel in great location!,"The Hari is a fantastic by hotel in a great location. Top notch service from everyone, great restaurant and room service, very clean and updated rooms. Location is perfect if you want to walk to Mayfair, Marylebone Hyde park and Sloan street shops. Would absolutely recommend!"
November 2023,The Hari is an undeniable Gem in Belgravia,"From the minute you step into this gorgeous boutique hotel, you feel very much at home. A cozy and modern hotel located in a beautiful neighbourhood, 10 minutes walk to Hyde Park, Harrods and KnightsBridge shopping district. The bed is extremely comfortable and the rooms are super clean. The staff are so lovely and welcoming especially Claudio at the front desk who made us feel right at home.  I have become a regular , and cant think of anywhere else better to stay at in London."
November 2023,Perfect London stay,"Second time staying here, it was just as amazing as the first time. Everyone working at the hotel is incredibly friendly and all are very attentive. The rooms are cozy and modern. And the hotel is located in a relatively convenient location despite London being generally difficult to get around when compared to NYC. HIGHLY recommend staying here if going to London on vacation or business!"
November 2023,A great first London visit,"The Hari, amenities and staff, was great. You couldn't ask for a better location, easy walking to plenty of shops, sights and restaurants as well as tube stations.  Our room was super comfortable with a very welcoming bed at the end of the day.  Don't neglect breakfast. Believe it or not the porridge is a thing as are the pancakes.  Thanks Hari!"
November 2023,Highly recommend this hotel,"I stay at the Hari quite regularly simply because I continue to have great experiences there. It's an excellent boutique hotel! Belgrave Place is a relatively quiet square but it's ideally located. The hotel is relaxing and the staff (many of whom have worked there for a number of years) are very friendly. They are also attentive and professional. Although not overly large (London, like many capital city hotel rooms typically aren't), the rooms are of high quality with stylish modern decoration. The beds are exceptionally comfortable and I always get a good nights sleep."
November 2023,Wonderful hotel!,"This was our first visit to The Hari. It won't be the last. The service was amazing... from the Front Desk to Guest Services to the door men. Everyone was so friendly.  I mentioned that it was my wife's birthday and they prepared the most fantastic balloons, cake and flowers - along with some lovely notes. It was such an unexpected - but wonderful surprise. Nobody could do enough. It really is a fantastic hotel. Highly recommend."
November 2023,Amazing service at the lounge and I would thank Angelica and Sergiu for their hospitality,"Their service is absolutely top-notch! The staff is friendly, attentive, and goes above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience and would especially thank Angelica and Sergiu. Whether you're enjoying a cup of coffee or indulging in their delicious menu, you can expect nothing but exceptional service.

November 2023,Wonderful hotel!,"This was our first visit to The Hari. It won't be the last. The service was amazing... from the Front Desk to Guest Services to the door men. Everyone was so friendly.  I mentioned that it was my wife's birthday and they prepared the most fantastic balloons, cake and flowers - along with some lovely notes. It was such an unexpected - but wonderful surprise. Nobody could do enough. It really is a fantastic hotel. Highly recommend."
November 2023,Amazing service at the lounge and I would thank Angelica and Sergiu for their hospitality,"Their service is absolutely top-notch! The staff is friendly, attentive, and goes above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience and would especially thank Angelica and Sergiu.

Top notch service from everyone, great restaurant and room service, very clean and updated rooms. Location is perfect if you want to walk to Mayfair, Marylebone Hyde park and Sloan street shops. Would absolutely recommend!"
November 2023,The Hari is an undeniable Gem in Belgravia,"From the minute you step into this gorgeous boutique hotel, you feel very much at home. A cozy and modern hotel located in a beautiful neighbourhood, 10 minutes walk to Hyde Park, Harrods and KnightsBridge shopping district. The bed is extremely comfortable and the rooms are super clean. The staff are so lovely and welcoming especially Claudio at the front desk who made us feel right at home.  I have become a regular , and cant think of anywhere else better to stay at in London."
November 2023,Perfect London stay,"Second time staying here, it was just as amazing as the first time. Everyone working at the hotel is incredibly friendly and all are very attentive. The rooms are cozy and modern. And the hotel is located in a relatively convenient location despite London being generally difficult to get around when compared to NYC. HIGHLY recommend staying here if going to London on vacation or business!"
November 2023,A great first London visit,"The Hari, amenities and staff, was great. You couldn't ask for a better location, easy walking to plenty of shops, sights and restaurants as well as tube stations.  Our room was super comfortable with a very welcoming bed at the end of the day.  Don't neglect breakfast. Believe it or not the porridge is a thing as are the pancakes.  Thanks Hari!"
November 2023,Highly recommend this hotel,"I stay at the Hari quite regularly simply because I continue to have great experiences there. It's an excellent boutique hotel! Belgrave Place is a relatively quiet square but it's ideally located. The hotel is relaxing and the staff (many of whom have worked there for a number of years) are very friendly.

HIGHLY recommend staying here if going to London on vacation or business!"
November 2023,A great first London visit,"The Hari, amenities and staff, was great. You couldn't ask for a better location, easy walking to plenty of shops, sights and restaurants as well as tube stations.  Our room was super comfortable with a very welcoming bed at the end of the day.  Don't neglect breakfast. Believe it or not the porridge is a thing as are the pancakes.  Thanks Hari!"
November 2023,Highly recommend this hotel,"I stay at the Hari quite regularly simply because I continue to have great experiences there. It's an excellent boutique hotel! Belgrave Place is a relatively quiet square but it's ideally located. The hotel is relaxing and the staff (many of whom have worked there for a number of years) are very friendly. They are also attentive and professional. Although not overly large (London, like many capital city hotel rooms typically aren't), the rooms are of high quality with stylish modern decoration. The beds are exceptionally comfortable and I always get a good nights sleep."
November 2023,Wonderful hotel!,"This was our first visit to The Hari. It won't be the last. The service was amazing... from the Front Desk to Guest Services to the door men. Everyone was so friendly.  I mentioned that it was my wife's birthday and they prepared the most fantastic balloons, cake and flowers - along with some lovely notes. It was such an unexpected - but wonderful surprise. Nobody could do enough. It really is a fantastic hotel. Highly recommend."
November 2023,Amazing service at the lounge and I would thank Angelica and Sergiu for their hospitality,"Their service is absolutely top-notch! The staff is friendly, attentive, and goes above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience and would especially thank Angelica and Sergiu. Whether you're enjoying a cup of coffee or indulging in their delicious menu, you can expect nothing but exceptional service. I highly recommend checking out The Hari Lounge for a memorable and enjoyable time! 🌟👌"

October 2021,Fantastic hotel in great location!,"The Hari is a fantastic by hotel in a great location. Top notch service from everyone, great restaurant and room service, very clean and updated rooms. Location is perfect if you want to walk to Mayfair, Marylebone Hyde park and Sloan street shops. Would absolutely recommend!"
November 2023,The Hari is an undeniable Gem in Belgravia,"From the minute you step into this gorgeous boutique hotel, you feel very much at home. A cozy and modern hotel located in a beautiful neighbourhood, 10 minutes walk to Hyde Park, Harrods and KnightsBridge shopping district. The bed is extremely comfortable and the rooms are super clean. The staff are so lovely and welcoming especially Claudio at the front desk who made us feel right at home.  I have become a regular , and cant think of anywhere else better to stay at in London."
November 2023,Perfect London stay,"Second time staying here, it was just as amazing as the first time. Everyone working at the hotel is incredibly friendly and all are very attentive. The rooms are cozy and modern. And the hotel is located in a relatively convenient location despite London being generally difficult to get around when compared to NYC. HIGHLY recommend staying here if going to London on vacation or business!"
November 2023,A great first London visit,"The Hari, amenities and staff, was great. You couldn't ask for a better location, easy walking to plenty of shops, sights and restaurants as well as tube stations.  Our room was super comfortable with a very welcoming bed at the end of the day.  Don't neglect breakfast. Believe it or not the porridge is a thing as are the pancakes.  Thanks Hari!"
November 2023,Highly recommend this hotel,"I stay at the Hari quite regularly simply because I continue to have great experiences there. It's an excellent boutique hotel! Belgrave Place is a relatively quiet square but it's ideally located. The hotel is relaxing and the staff (many of whom have worked there for a number of years) are very friendly. They are also attentive and professional. Although not overly large (London, like many capital city hotel rooms typically aren't), the rooms are of high quality with stylish modern decoration. The beds are exceptionally comfortable and I always get a good nights sleep."
November 2023,Wonderful hotel!,"This was our first visit to The Hari. It won't be the last. The service was amazing... from the Front Desk to Guest Services to the door men. Everyone was so friendly.  I mentioned that it was my wife's birthday and they prepared the most fantastic balloons, cake and flowers - along with some lovely notes. It was such an unexpected - but wonderful surprise. Nobody could do enough. It really is a fantastic hotel. Highly recommend."
November 2023,Amazing service at the lounge and I would thank Angelica and Sergiu for their hospitality,"Their service is absolutely top-notch! The staff is friendly, attentive, and goes above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience and would especially thank Angelica and Sergiu. Whether you're enjoying a cup of coffee or indulging in their delicious menu, you can expect nothing but exceptional service. I highly recommend checking out The Hari Lounge for a memorable and enjoyable time! 🌟👌"

It was such an unexpected - but wonderful surprise. Nobody could do enough. It really is a fantastic hotel. Highly recommend."
November 2023,Amazing service at the lounge and I would thank Angelica and Sergiu for their hospitality,"Their service is absolutely top-notch! The staff is friendly, attentive, and goes above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience and would especially thank Angelica and Sergiu. Whether you're enjoying a cup of coffee or indulging in their delicious menu, you can expect nothing but exceptional service. I highly recommend checking out The Hari Lounge for a memorable and enjoyable time! 🌟👌"
November 2023,Food and service,I visited the hari with my friends we sat in the terrace Angelica was there to help us she was very nice and she recommended amazing chocolate donuts the coffee there is perfect. I really enjoyed the vibe and I highly recommend you to pay a visit.
November 2023,The hari visit.,"Very beautiful bar. Great place for a gathering, amazing, quick service. Would definitely visit again.  The staff were very helpful. And the lounge was very nice. The atmosphere in general was just excellent.   The food and coffee were delectable."
December 2023,Great Hotel to Saty,I have stayed recently at The Hari and it was my first time vesting London. The staff are very friendly and CLARA​ LEFRANC Guest Relations Manager is an amazing person who shared special wishes with me and celebrated by birthday.  
October 2021,Fantastic hotel in great location!,"The Hari is a fantastic by hotel in a great location. Top notch service from everyone, great restaurant and room service, very clean and updated rooms. Location is perfect if you want to walk to Mayfair, Marylebone Hyde park and Sloan street shops. Would absolutely recommend!"
November 2023,The Hari is an undeniable Gem in Belgravia,"From the minute you step into this gorgeous boutique hotel, you feel very much at home. A cozy and modern hotel located in a beautiful neighbourhood, 10 minutes walk to Hyde Park, Harrods and KnightsBridge shopping district. The bed is extremely comfortable and the rooms are super clean. The staff are so lovely and welcoming especially Claudio at the front desk who made us feel right at home.  I have become a regular , and cant think of anywhere else better to stay at in London."
November 2023,Perfect London stay,"Second time staying here, it was just as amazing as the first time. Everyone working at the hotel is incredibly friendly and all are very attentive. The rooms are cozy and modern. And the hotel is located in a relatively convenient location despite London being generally difficult to get around when compared to NYC. HIGHLY recommend staying here if going to London on vacation or business!"
November 2023,A great first London visit,"The Hari, amenities and staff, was great. You couldn't ask for a better location, easy walking to plenty of shops, sights and restaurants as well as tube stations.  Our room was super comfortable with a very welcoming bed at the end of the day.  Don't neglect breakfast. Believe it or not the porridge is a thing as are the pancakes.  Thanks Hari!"
November 2023,Highly recommend this hotel,"I stay at the Hari quite regularly simply because I continue to have great experiences there. It's an excellent boutique hotel! Belgrave Place is a relatively quiet square but it's ideally located. The hotel is relaxing and the staff (many of whom have worked there for a number of years) are very friendly. They are also attentive and professional. Although not overly large (London, like many capital city hotel rooms typically aren't), the rooms are of high quality with stylish modern decoration. The beds are exceptionally comfortable and I always get a good nights sleep."

You couldn't ask for a better location, easy walking to plenty of shops, sights and restaurants as well as tube stations.  Our room was super comfortable with a very welcoming bed at the end of the day.  Don't neglect breakfast. Believe it or not the porridge is a thing as are the pancakes.  Thanks Hari!"
November 2023,Highly recommend this hotel,"I stay at the Hari quite regularly simply because I continue to have great experiences there. It's an excellent boutique hotel! Belgrave Place is a relatively quiet square but it's ideally located. The hotel is relaxing and the staff (many of whom have worked there for a number of years) are very friendly. They are also attentive and professional. Although not overly large (London, like many capital city hotel rooms typically aren't), the rooms are of high quality with stylish modern decoration. The beds are exceptionally comfortable and I always get a good nights sleep."
November 2023,Wonderful hotel!,"This was our first visit to The Hari. It won't be the last. The service was amazing... from the Front Desk to Guest Services to the door men. Everyone was so friendly.  I mentioned that it was my wife's birthday and they prepared the most fantastic balloons, cake and flowers - along with some lovely notes. It was such an unexpected - but wonderful surprise. Nobody could do enough. It really is a fantastic hotel. Highly recommend."
November 2023,Amazing service at the lounge and I would thank Angelica and Sergiu for their hospitality,"Their service is absolutely top-notch! The staff is friendly, attentive, and goes above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience and would especially thank Angelica and Sergiu. Whether you're enjoying a cup of coffee or indulging in their delicious menu, you can expect nothing but exceptional service. I highly recommend checking out The Hari Lounge for a memorable and enjoyable time! 🌟👌"
