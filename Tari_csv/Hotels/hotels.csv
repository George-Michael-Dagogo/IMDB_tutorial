June 2023,The best city hotel there is.,The most wonderful experience.  A rare solo trip for two days and was welcomed and treated like an old friend.  The staff are all wonderful.  Was given a surprise upgrade to the magnificent monarch suite which made this tired travelled immediately relaxed and refreshed.  It‚Äôs the best breakfast I‚Äôve ever had and the executive lounge is relaxing at any time of the day.  Wonderful experience and can‚Äôt wait to come back.
May 2023,Staff made us feel truly welcome,"Lovely stay.  The hotel staff went above and beyond, and made for a memorable London experience.   We enjoyed spending time in the lounge and on the rooftop patio, both of which were great places to relax after a day of exploring the city.  Highly recommend."
June 2023,Beyond expectations!!,"Outstanding facility all the way around.  Covered us up with smiling service, consistently, and everyone was a delight to be around.  The room was very clean and we were gifted champagne for our anniversary.  Dermo went above and beyond and arranged for packages to be mailed back home.  There are many good reasons that it's the #1 hotel in London.  We're so glad to have stayed with them."
May 2023,Exquisite is an understatement!  ,We have never experienced this type of uniquely refined experience and attention anywhere!  From the time you step your foot into the door you are treated like the King and Queen of England--truly.  Attention to detail at every turn.  Hotel 41 is a charming old English experience without being pretentious.  Treat yourself - it is worth it!
May 2023,Authentic hospitality like we‚Äôve never experienced before,"41 Hotel - where do I start. We‚Äôve stayed at most of the top London hotels so were greatly looking forward to this experience.  The hotel is located on a busy road just a stones throw from Buckingham Palace with many traffic restrictions so we were a little nervous about arriving by car. Luckily the hotel had thought of everything and had sent a detailed information mail in advance outlying their services to assist the guest experience. We alerted them to our arrival so a helpful and cheerful valet was already waiting for us to whisk the car away. When you enter the ground floor lobby, you are transported away from the tourist chaos outside in an instant to a calm and opulent oasis. You are greeted by Marble floors,  wood panelled walls and chandeliers. The friendly staff member‚Ä¶"
May 2023,Relaxing Stop to End Long Trip,"The staff is especially responsive, the service prompt, the rooms are charming, the hotel's location is central to key London sights, the martinis are perfect and the ice cream is delightful for a late-night snack."
May 2023,Outstanding hotel even better staff.,"This was our third visit and everything was simply outstanding as usual.   My partner had booked us a room last minute as a treat for my birthday and we were massively surprised to find that we had been upgraded when we were shown to our room.   From the complimentary glass of champagne during the booking in process through to the open pantry and cheese and ham toasties before dinner and the fantastic choice of snacks until 01:00 hrs you just can‚Äôt fault what‚Äôs on offer, but the thing that makes the hotel so special is the staff!   Every single member of the team go over and above to make you feel so very special and have so much time for you.   The hotel itself is ideally located for the normal touristy things‚Ä¶Buckingham Palace is your next door neighbour and Hamilton is‚Ä¶"
May 2023,I was treated like royalty,Everything about Hotel 41 is excellent. The comfortable rooms and bed and the fantastic service. From the moment I arrived to my departure I loved every minute. We discovered this hotel many years ago and I had not returned for several years and found that this property has aged well and if anything the service has improved which is hard to believe. They do have rooms with a shower and I have a hard time getting in and out of a bath. I will return again.
May 2023,Weekend break ,"A hidden gem. No bar or restaurant, just the 'executive lounge' which is the hub, where guests are welcomed (with champagne and canap√©s) and where you can relax, it's also where breakfast is served.  The benefit feels like a quiet private member's club , where you can leave  the hustle and bustle of central London outside,perfect if you don't want a really busy hotel with lobby, lots of other people around.  The downside is a slight feeling of claustrophobia due to the narrow entrance and narrow corridors and the one small social space. To be fair, there is a secret door that leads into next door Reubans Hotel, where there are great bar's and restaurants to choose from, which adds to the exclusive feel of going back to hotel 41 as a nice separate space.The service is impeccable‚Ä¶"
May 2023,Best London Hotel,Having never visited London we wanted a hotel with great reviews that was central to the major sites. You cannot go wrong staying here. Amazing service and food and comfortable rooms with everything you need!! And the staff could not be more responsive or pleasant! We couldn‚Äôt be happier with our stay at Hotel 41!!!
March 2023,Amazing honeymoon experience üòç ,"My husband and I recently stayed at hotel 41 London, in the Conservatory suite for our honeymoon. From the moment we walked in we felt well taken care of, and we enjoyed everything from the greeting glass of sparkling wine to the optional extras like flowers and chocolates in the room. The meals, the service, and the beauty of this historic boutique hotel were all excellent. Be aware though, it is in the heart of the city and if you're a light Sleeper you may want to consider something to cut the noise of sirens. "
April 2023,Unique interior and very friendly staff,"Very friendly staff who helped us, excellent customer service, great location, nice food, the roof terrase is an extra cool feature of this hotel.  Interior design and furniture are unique and has its nice character. "
April 2023,Absolutely first class,"After numerous visits to Hotel 41, it never fails to please. The accommodation is outstanding, and the breakfasts are amazing. The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff are a credit to the Hotel. Nothing is too much trouble. "
March 2023,"The best hotel in London, hands down!","This is the second time we've stayed at Hotel41 and it won't be our last. What makes this hotel extremely special is the care that each and every staff members provide. It is amazing that the staff knows and remembers your name. Once you arrive, they never ask your name, they just know it. I tried to find out how they do it, but no one would divulge this secret. :-)   We loved hanging out in the lounge before and after dinner! The endless amount of snacks provided are also such a special touch. The housekeeping staff is the best staff that I've ever encountered, and we've stayed at many luxurious hotels. We can't wait to come back and visit again!"
February 2023,Hotel 41 - Only Option!,"I don‚Äôt usually write reviews, but in this case, I must. The staff at Hotel 41 graciously welcomes you into their family and makes you feel like home.  After spending seven nights at Hotel 41, I can truly say that other hotels simply do not and cannot compare. This is a 5-star hotel that is head and shoulders above other 5-star hotels. A few specific shout outs are absolutely necessary.  Sebestian (from Ruben‚Äôs) - His cheery disposition and positivity is second to none!   Alexandros - His thoughtful dining suggestions quickly became our list of musts. Alexandros‚Äô quiet and considerate nature was so welcomed after long, busy days.  Belle - She always knew what we wanted before we even had to ask. Being proactive, attentive, and personable are just a couple of Belle‚Äôs strengths. ‚Ä¶"
March 2023,Fantastic stay,"Fantastic stay at hotel 41. We stayed for two nights and had a wonderful stay, the bed was so comfortable,soft luxurious linen. The room was clean and had everything you needed. The staff couldn‚Äôt do enough for you, very attentive and professional. There is absolutely nothing to criticise, from the moment we walked in to the time we checked out."
March 2023,Exceeded Expectations ,"A place you dream of going back to. Prime location close to sights and public transportation, quiet, staff that treats you with a personal touch, a plethora of amenities from a free high-end buffet to little treats left at turndown and plush rooms that mix modern touches with old English style.  What a value for a hotel that makes you feel special each moment you come in or leave! Every staff member was friendly and interested (huge shout-out to Alex who served me several times in the lounge) and they made an effort to listen. For example, on my first night I returned home from a show to find a note from housekeeping saying they hoped I enjoyed it.  The accommodations are quiet and peaceful. I spent hours in the lounge in the evening reading and enjoying the complimentary buffet‚Ä¶"
April 2022,At Home in Hotel 41,"Before my family travels abroad, we usually research the highest rated (by ranking) hotels in our destination cities.  In 2016, Hotel 41 (A Red Carnation Property) was one of the highest ranked hotels in London & featured stellar reviews for its location &  service.  We decided to stay there and were thrilled we did.  We will never forget the tea and treats, the uniquely designed rooms and convenient location.  All the photos of their rooms and common areas on the  website look pristine and that's exactly how we found them.    After busy days of exploring London, visiting Stonehenge, and taking in the musical Aladdin, we return to Hotel 41 ready to relax as if it were our home.  We would usually sit in what looked like a large library or observatory and just exhale & recount the‚Ä¶"
March 2023,Amazing hotel and such attentive staff.,"Where to begin?! We went to London to go to the theatre for my wife's birthday and stayed two nights. All members of staff at Hotel 41 were fantastic and nothing was too much trouble for anyone. We were upgraded to an Executive Suite which was lovely. The room was super comfortable and the little touches were so nice from a little message on the mirror in the bathroom to finding our glasses cleaned and a hotel styled glasses cloth each left for us. Petals by the bed and a hot water bottle waiting for us were more wonderful touches. The food throughout the day was delicious- big fan of the plunder the pantry- and all staff from the doorman to the porters were all fantastically friendly, helpful and attentive. We felt like they were all so eager for us to have the best possible‚Ä¶"
March 2023,Simply First Class,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 again on a trip into London. It's an absolute gem. From the moment you walk through the door you are treat like royalty, every member of staff will go out of their way to make your stay as pleasant and as enjoyable as possible. The room was fantastic with every little detail considered and thought through so you want for nothing, with special little touches thrown in like welcome Macarons, turn down service etc. Drinks and plundering the pantry add to the whole relaxing and enjoyable experience. Having tried many similar hotels in London, this is our hotel of choice, it is simply first class!"
August 2023,Suberb and welcoming !,5 star service ! From the arrival to the departure. Very impressive. Connor was so kind and congenial. This type of service has a high value to us and we are very happy we chose Hotel 41 for our London 4 day trip. This is a great location close to the Victoria Train station /Gatwick Express.
August 2023,Sons 18th birthday,Great hotel . Staff went above and beyond for my sons 18th birthday . They put us in a private dining room for breakfast . They offered us a welcome drink . The snack bar was amazing with ice cream included 
August 2023,10/10 an absolute dream stay ,This hotel is a gem in London! Great air conditioning (for us from the USA) and the staff was incredible. The food was 5 star and house keeping impeccable. Would recommend to anyone and will return again! 
August 2023,The No 41 experience ,"Second time at this hotel and definitely won't be the last! A luxurious stay from start to finish . Beautiful rooms,wonderful staff and such a calm , tranquil atmosphere. Fully deserving of its reputation as the best in the UK."
July 2023,Not our cup of tea by a long shot!,"I have relied on TripAdvisor to book hotels and restaurants for almost 20 years. We even sometimes select cities to visit simply based on the hotel. As such and because I so rely on reviews that I relate to, I want to provide a clear picture of what you get at Hotel 41. We have previously stayed at The Edgerton House (another Red Carnation hotel in London) and the Ritz Carlton in London - and we absolutely loved both. In fact, we so enjoyed our time at The Edgerton House and after speaking with the manager there, we wanted to book another hotel in their collection.  We extremely disliked the ""atmosphere"" as well as the teeny tiny rooms, extremely narrow hallways, and limited common space at Hotel 41. And no one, except for the gentleman at the lobby desk one evening, ever asked‚Ä¶"
August 2023,Excellent,Excellent staff and service food and location brilliant rooms really lovely and decorated to a high standard wonderful stay all round hopefully will be back soon thank you to all for making us feel very welcome 
August 2023,Hotel 41. Highly recommend for a London stay,"Hotel 41 is an amazing hotel. Great location, very friendly and helpful / accommodating staff, comfortable rooms I would never think twice at always staying at hotel 41 when in London. Hotel 41 makes you feel at home. Highly recommend. BTW: Great snack bar in the Fabilous lobby "
August 2023,Perfect,"We‚Äôve just returned from a two night stay at 41 - where stayed over 20 times.  It‚Äôs hard to des rube just how good the event is. I call it an event because every member of staff is consistently brilliant, helpful and friendly. Many staff have been there years and it‚Äôs like coming home - but nicer.  41 is a boutique hotel - rather like an exclusive club - quite old fashioned but in a brilliant way. The staff are simply exceptional. Nothing is too much trouble. The executive lounge is perfect in its tranquility and style. Adele and Marlen are stalwarts who make everything perfect.   There is a ‚Äògrab‚Äô bar of sweets during the day, scones in the afternoon, various dishes / cakes during the evening all complimentary. It‚Äôs annexed to the Rub√©n‚Äôs hotel so the extent of beverages and‚Ä¶"
July 2023,Worth it,I think I have reviewed 41 on other stays but I am not sure I said the following: It is worth the premium you pay simply for the service and the wonderful people that provide it. We actually miss the friends we have made on the staff. And I am not sure there is a better location of a hotel in London to reach everything. Victoria Station two blocks in one direction and Buckingham two blocks in the other.
June 2023,Just like Home.. without the work,"This is a home away from home experience.  If you want a big hotel vibe with loads of action go next door to their sister hotel.  We LOVED our experience here.  The staff were like family by the time we left.  From check in to the incredible bar/waitstaff you literally are spoiled.  Rooms are well appointed with big waters, beautiful soap and lovely little presents on your bed in the evening.  The location is the best close to the changing of the guard, and Buckingham.  The hotel has a cute small rooftop bar that you can have a cocktail and just get away from the chaos of the city.  If I return I will stay here as it felt like home."
March 2023,Very Warm Welcome,"How great to return to your room in the middle of winter with the gas fireplace glowing. With all our previous stays at the amazing Hotel 41, this is the first time our room came with a fireplace. We loved the warm, cozy atmosphere the fireplace created in our room. Although every room and suite can be very different, although they all have the famed black and white design theme.   Of course, hospitality and service by this caring team are still second to none. With the departure of former resident manager Lauren, the resident team of everyone including Dean and Marlen went out of their way to ensure we enjoyed everything and left with smiles on our faces. Thanks Adele for the goody bag of treats for our travels to Birmingham. This is the the only place we will stay when‚Ä¶"
March 2023,Incredible hotel ,Absolutely awesome hotel. Cannot fault it at all. Pure luxury. Customer service is the best I‚Äôve ever experienced. Special mention to James. Complete maturity and professionalism from a 20 year old. Cannot wait for my next trip here. 
March 2023,"41 is a jewel amongst hotels in London,","I am very spoilt when it comes to hotels. Since I'm a german Lifestyle-journalist who used to traveling the world.  I know a lot of hot spots already.   ...but what shall I say.... Hotel 41 is unique in every kind of a way. The extras like complementary sweets, the plunder the pantry-service. The VIP service for every ! guest (not only for the Very v's) ,. The very private atmosphere. the high-end decor and surrounding. It feels like (I guess)  a little bit like being part of the movie Downtown Abbey, spending time in a Castle, not in an hotel . Feeling like a Duchess in front of the fire place drinking tea and eating scones. Served by so wonderful, high professional , lovely members of the staff of 41. Unfortunately I forgot the names since, but I remember Esin, what a‚Ä¶"
March 2023,Amazing,"Second time here and I have to say the place is unreal, from the minute you step in the door to the minute you  leave, the service goes above and beyond.  The welcome glass of champagne before you even check in, was a great start. Stunning room, amazing breakfast and top quality staff."
March 2023,Can‚Äôt recommend highly enough,"I can‚Äôt praise this hotel enough. Probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in for lots of reasons, and I‚Äôve stayed in some of the best hotels around the world. It‚Äôs basically a boutique hotel with 28 rooms. There‚Äôs no standing around to check in at a reception desk, they come to you with an iPad while you‚Äôre enjoying your welcome drink and some well thought out nibbles in a gorgeous cosy gentlemen‚Äôs club like lounge area. In this same room they have an array of complimentary food day and night and a fully stocked paid bar. They are open 24hours. You also get your breakfast there which was delicious. We were upgraded (no idea why) to a suite that had a free mini bar, sky tv and a gas real flame fire that they put on for us that evening. The small group of staff couldn‚Äôt be more‚Ä¶"
February 2023,Totally pampered,"From the moment you enter the Hotel 41 you are treated with incredible service. There is   amazing attention to detail which makes the stay so memorable. The highlight for me was coming back to the room after a long, tiring and chilly February day in London and finding a hot water bottle in the bed. Bliss! "
February 2023,Wonderful Stay,I had a wonderful stay at Hotel 41. My room was very comfortable and I really appreciated the little surprise touches for my birthday. The service from the staff was exceptional; everyone was friendly and made sure I had everything I needed. One of the best breakfasts I‚Äôve ever had and ‚ÄòPlunder the Pantry‚Äô was great to return to after an evening out. I can‚Äôt wait for my next stay.
February 2023,A cocoon of calm in the heart of London,"We love this gem of a hotel - it is instantly soothing, from the refreshing water on arrival, to the gorgeous scents and chic black and white decor. The beds are divinely comfortable, all the better to flop into after ""plundering the pantry""! The staff are friendly and give you really personal service. We hope to be back again!"
February 2023,A little gem hidden in the city!,"I cannot fault this amazing hotel. It was an oasis of calm in the middle of the city! Every member of staff were exceptional, making us feel so welcome and anticipating our evert need. Being a small hotel made such a difference as you were made to feel very special. The rooms were spotless and very comfortable. We had such a lovely relaxing stay here and we will most certainly go back."
March 2022,A true 5 star hotel,"Late review but I had to show appreciation when I remembered.  From the hotel doorman and entrance hall, to the lounge and room, everything was magnificent.  Lounge had a complimentary sweet bar and fridge stocked with ice cream for guests and we were welcomed with a glass of champagne. Full English breakfast was one of the best we‚Äôve had and very generous.  Room was small but very nice with comfortable bed and nice touch of lavender pillow spray for us to use and take home. Also a surprise birthday cake for my husbands 30th.  All staff were friendly and accommodating without being overbearing, no snobby staff who haven‚Äôt got the time of day and look down on you here.  We loved this hotel and would definitely visit again, it‚Äôs the perfect place for a special occasion or just‚Ä¶"
September 2023,Unique experience - feels like staying at a friend in his old Englisch home. Highly recommended.,"Excellent! Very unique experience. Not your typical hotel with a gracious foyer or reception. Feels more like staying at your friends old English home. Very cozy. Unbelievable friendly, vigilant and helpful staff. Great location. Lots of attractions and restaurants/pubs in walking distance. Hanging out in their executive lounge provides tranquillity and brings you back in time. The same applies to the rooms. Breakfast and drinks are outstanding. They even have a little rooftop terrace with seating and a bar. The only thing, though: I am 6 feet tall and not all of the sitting areas in the beautiful executive lounge are spacious enough to sit comfortably. One bathroom in our room felt more like I have to put it on rather than being able to walk in. Given the otherwise outstanding‚Ä¶"
September 2023,Perfection,Just returned from a 3rd visit to Hotel 41 as was celebrating a big birthday. From the minute you step foot into the downstairs foyer you are treated like royalty. All the staff are so helpful & nothing is too much trouble. I do have to give Connor a special mention here as he was who we all dealt with the most. They  arranged canap√©s & champagne on the roof top bar before we went out. You actually don‚Äôt even need to go anywhere as there is always something out for you to eat! We all can‚Äôt wait to return & are already planning our next visit.
July 2023,Wonderful experience.,"We loved this hotel.  The staff treated us like royalty the moment we walked through the door. Hotel 41 is a boutique hotel with only 28 rooms.  The staff‚Äôs attention to detail is remarkable.  The rooms were nicely appointed and the black and white decor is very attractive .  Upon arrival, we were taken to the Executive Lounge where everything happens.  Breakfast, tea time and dinner is served in the lounge.  Our breakfast was included with our reservation.  All other food was complimentary.  The only complaint we have is that it was not made clear that the beverages are not included (ie juice, coffee, tea, soda).  It was our understanding that only alcoholic beverages were not included.  There were four of us present when the amenities were explained.  I don‚Äôt believe all four‚Ä¶"
August 2023,Brilliant!,Outstanding service. Excellent location opposite Buckingham Palace. Have stayed twice and will return. It‚Äôs the little touches like staff knowing your name that make this hotel stand out. Breakfast was fabulous too.
August 2023,Service with a capital S!,"The service at this hotel is AMAZING!  It is in a great location, and the rooms are really nice, but what separates it is the service!  From the welcome champagne to the day long snacks, they really could not be any more accommodating.  Our stay in London was too short this time but would definitely return to the 41 on a future trip‚Ä¶.five stars all the way!"
August 2023,Outstanding Service In an Elegant Boutique Hotel,"The most superb experience we've ever had at a 5-star property.  Outstanding personalized service, beautiful accommodations, and amazingly attentive staff.  We were greeted by name by each staff person, provided super helpful suggestions for day trips and dinner cruise, and made to feel incredibly special.  One of the best boutique properties we've ever experienced - and we've been to a lot! "
August 2023,Excellent Experience,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for two nights and found the experience to be perfect. From the seemless check in, to the fantastic staff. Our room was extremely well appointed and lacked for no amenities. The Executive Lounge was wonderful, and our breakfasts were top notch."
August 2023,Absolutely stunning hotel,"Hotel 41 is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed!  The rooms are absolutely gorgeous.  The staff is UNBELIEVABLY helpful, courteous, welcoming and accommodating.  We will definitely return and will recommend this hotel every time someone asks us about our trip to London.  This one should not be missed!  "
August 2023,50th birthday celebration,"Stayed for my wife‚Äôs 50th birthday, from the moment we arrived to the minute we left everything we experienced was just totally flawless, from  the staff to the whole experience of the hotel was just outstanding, the staff go above and beyond making your stay special, by far the best hotel we have stayed in and we will definitely be returning, well done hotel 41 you deserve all the accolades that come your way üëèüëèüëè"
July 2023,Hotel 41 Is What Every London Hotel Should be Modeled On,"This is hands down my wife's and I favorite hotel (and now even our 3 children)! We've been there 3 times now and It's pure English Class with the best service that we have ever received anywhere in the world. The rooms are impeccable and the thoughtfulness  and attention to detail of the staff is exquisite.   Also, their executive lounge (the heart of the hotel) is one of the most coziest and relaxing places we have ever had a meal or drinks. It made me feel like at anytime I could turn my head and see Sherlock Holmes in a corner sofa drinking some brandy attempting to solve his next case.   All that to say, if you want an unforgettable time in London, Hotel 41 is a must! "
October 2023,No better place in London to stay,"This was our 10th stay at Hotel 41 since 2013.  It only gets the better with each stay.  From the moment we arrive a little sleepy from our overnight flight to the last breakfast before heading to the airport the service levels are unparallel to any hotel in the world.  As I may have said in previous review, any hotel with a button on the phone that says ""Whatever, Whenever"" is a place you must stay.  We will be back again (and again).    The entire staff always has a smile on their face and treat you like family."
October 2023,Recurring theme,"Back to 41 again, and how lovely it was to return.  When you haven‚Äôt stayed for a few months, you tend to forget the amount of pleasure you feel when the greeting comes from each and every member of the team who approach with a welcoming smile.  And so it begins: the experience of being a treasured guest at every moment of contact, your every wish carried out and in many cases, anticipated and a choice offered.  This is five- star hospitality as it should be, as the prestigious Forbes rating denotes.   There are many accounts of the quality of the Team, the Executive Lounge, the impeccable housekeeping, the wonderful quirkiness of the building and the Plunder the Pantry offering (which was recommended to me by an American guest who was unaware that I was a regular, and was‚Ä¶"
October 2023,The best of the best,"Hotel 41 can not be beaten. It is so comfortable and relaxing with attention to every detail. We have stayed many times and will continue to do so. We feel so at home in the lounge, where we enjoy the friendly atmosphere, and a laugh with the staff. Satish, Esin Rory and Gabrielle are just priceless."
October 2023,The most fabulous hotel in the heart of London.,"An exceptional boutique hotel next door to Buckingham Palace and 2 minutes from Victoria.  Only 28 rooms, each beautifully appointed and very, very quiet, despite being in the centre of London.  The staff provide 5 star plus service from booking to departure. They are friendly, gracious and extremely helpful.  A perfect oasis for a short or long stay.  Delicious breakfasts. Snacks on display and a magnificent range of wines, cocktails and spirits."
October 2023,Practically Perfect In Every Way,"The ideal London hotel. The staff lead the charge in creating the charm, elegance, and character of this wonderful respite. They work in tandem to create incredible bespoke experiences for their guests, taking care to understand our personal and practical needs, while enriching our experiences with their own personal flare. It was such a pleasure to spend time with each and every one we met there, and sincerely appreciate their attentiveness, thoughtfulness, and creativity.   The beds and amenities are modern and comfortable, and the rooms, halls, and lounge exude cozy luxury. The lounge spoils guests with day-round availability of snacks, and there are fresh scones, jam and clotted cream after 2pm...skip the mid-day nap and rest up for your evening out by having scones and a‚Ä¶"
October 2023,Very unique and memorable hotel.,"I've been to many 5-star luxury hotels, but Hotel 41 left a very special impression. The entrance to the hotel was not large, but the hotel staff, who seemed to have been waiting for us from the moment we opened the door and walked in, welcomed us, guided us to a special lounge, served us welcome tea, and we received check-in service while eating a small cake. I was very impressed that the hotel already knew who we were and provided service before I even said my name. The hotel room was very comfortable, luxurious, and clean, and they provided cleaning service in the morning and evening, as well as a small gift. Also, every time we came back from sightseeing in London, they welcomed us at the door, so we felt like we were coming home every time. All of the bedding at Hotel 41‚Ä¶"
September 2023,Exceptional Service,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for three nights while in London. The hotel is wonderfully situated for exploring the city.  The room was lovely.  It was very quiet and the bed and pillows made falling asleep easy after a day of adventuring.  The shower had plenty of hot water and great water pressure.    The best thing about the hotel is the personal service.  The staff was eager to make sure we enjoyed our stay and our experience in London.  When we arrived after an overnight flight, the concierge saw to it that we got the best coffees to keep us awake and going throughout the day.  We were even able to check into our room early!  For the hotel happy hour, the server brought us canap√©s and salty snacks gratis.  The concierge was always eager to offer help and suggestions‚Ä¶"
September 2023,Stay here for a wonderful experience ,"I've stayed at many hotels, 5 stars among them over the years, but this place in terms of furnishings, and exceptional service absolutely stands out. In a word, it is a fabulous place and in a great central location as well. You can usually find something to critique wherever you go but we couldn't here.  From the time we arrived to when we left the service was 5 star plus. Consider this for your next trip to London as we will on our next trip...I can't imagine staying anywhere else after being here"
September 2023,Hotel 41 stay was excellent!,"My spouse and I stayed here for one night in mid September 2023. We loved it. We arrived into Heathrow from east coast U.S. at 6:30 a.m. and took the Tube To Victoria Station. From there it was about a 5 minute walk to the Hotel. We had emailed a couple months in  advance to ask about an early check-in. We got a quick reply with an offer to leave our bags and relax in the Executive Lounge. Arriving around 1000, we received exactly what we were told. The Executive Lounge was excellent! We enjoyed coffees, ordered greek yoghurts with raspberry compote (delicious) and very soon after our room was ready. The staff at check in and in the Executive Lounge were great. Our room (Junior Suite) right outside the Executive Lounge was top notch. A very large bathroom with both a large‚Ä¶"
September 2023,Simply the best of the best.,By far the best hotel I have EVER stayed in. The service was second to none. I stay in London often and often treat myself to a superior room or a suite. Their Executive King room trumped anywhere I have ever stayed including exclusive chains like the Baglioni and St Pancras Renaissance.  The staff were simply amazing. They made sure to know both my husband and I by name our entire stay.  The little touches in the room just went above and beyond. It was truly an experience.  Special shout out to Sh√¢n who was absolutely lovely.
February 2023,"An introduction that went really, really well.....","Three of us checked in to 41 ‚Äì two of us as regular returnees and one as a new guest ‚Äì to kick back and relax.  Dean had coordinated the new booking seamlessly and was there to greet us. From the outset, our friend was impressed with the efficiency and outstanding, welcoming service that we know is the heartbeat of 41.    Another success was our supper reservation at The Curry Room downstairs. Read a separate review for that excellent meal.  No need to venture outside on a cold night. Just sign your bill to the room.      Plunder the Pantry on Saturday night was the acid test after a delightful lunch at The Wolesley followed by a long walk.  He loved that evening‚Äôs offering of pork pies, cheese, and pickle jars, and went back for seconds of the mac'n'cheese.  And this was after‚Ä¶"
February 2023,"Lovely hotel, great location, outstanding service.","We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in February 2023. Good room, great location, but most impressive- outstanding service from every single staff member.  Helpful, courteous and knowledgeable, from the chambermaid to the manager. Fabulous!"
February 2023,Best hotel stay ever,"This Hotel and the staff are simply unbelievable! From the moment we walked through the door to the moment we had to leave I cannot describe what a fab stay we had. Unforgettable and we will return!   The service, complementary food, the room, the location - everything was simply perfect and made our anniversary stay so special.  Thank you!"
December 2022,The Best!!,"I would recommend Hotel 41 for all the obvious reasons - the best location in London, rooms, amenities, exceptional service and most importantly; value for money. I have stayed at Hotel 41 previously and most recently stayed at the hotel during the end of December 2022. It is what you would expect from a 5 star hotel - absolutely no faults. But, what sets Hotel 41 apart from other hotels are the amazing staff. They make the experience of staying at this hotel truly memorable - they are always friendly, extremely attentive, and clearly the best at what they do. Nothing was too much trouble for them and the smallest of details matter, from arrival to check out. Thanks again to Adele, Marlen, Dean and Dermo that were willing to go out of their way to make it an unforgettable‚Ä¶"
January 2023,Best 5-star hotel,"My wife claimed to be speechless when we entered our room at Hotel 41, but the superlatives kept coming.  From the very discreet entrance near Buckingham Palace to the check-in process (with complimentary drinks and food) to the executive lounge, the facilities are luxurious and the staff professional and extremely friendly.  The list of things they can help you with is long and includes packing your belongings prior to checkout.  The hotel is located in a very nice area of London within short distance of places to visit and a 2-minute walk from an underground station.  A stay at Hotel 41 is a lifetime memory and it is the best 5-star hotel we have visited."
January 2023,Lovely stay,"Everyone we met was so lovely. They remembered everything about us, couldn‚Äôt be more helpful and were very attentive. Wish we were there longer than 1 night. The room was really nice and the little touches like the candle in the bathroom made it extra special. "
January 2023,Incredible ,"We had our trip gifted to us for Christmas and it‚Äôs safe to say we will most definitely be back. The whole stay from the moment we checked in and felt like Luxury. The staff are phenomenal and cannot do enough. There is so many fabulous touches, the candles and petals in the room, the complimentary pantry, scones, ice cream. Not a single bad word to say as the hotel was incredible. We are looking forward to coming back to experience the pure luxury again! "
January 2023,The Perfect Stay in London,"Hotel 41 was the perfect stay in London. From check in to check out, every need and question was catered to. The staff was unbelievably friendly and really went out of their way to make my stay extra special. All the small noticeable touches were so lovely, especially the turn down service, what a lovely way to get ready for sleep. The executive lounge was such a beautiful spot to sit outside of the room and socialize with other guests. All the food, from afternoon scones, to plunder the pantry, and all the treats available all day long, the canap√©s, there was literally not a single moment to feel hungry. The breakfast was top notch. I don‚Äôt have a single complaint about my stay and cannot wait to return in the near future."
December 2022,Amazing service at Hotel 41,"We stayed at Hotel 41 in late December and I have to say that I have never experienced more attentive service. From the moment we arrived the staff were  super eager to help. We arrived on an early flight from Australia and  started with complimentary champagne and an excellent breakfast by the fire. They had our room ready soon after breakfast - something I really appreciated after such a long flight.   Hotel 41 is a boutique hotel - it is not large and aside from your room there is one main area that is used for reception and food service, as well as a smaller room used for reading or to host large tables for meals. After a small issue with the bath tub we were upgraded to suite. Stay in one of these if you can - it was beautiful. Our previous room was lovely and had‚Ä¶"
November 2022,Perfect London hideaway,"Lovely, comfortable hotel with flexible eating arrangements and a good linked bar/restaurant next door.   Very friendly and capable staff.   Extremely dog-friendly.   My late husband and I were regulars through and after lockdown and now that I am on my own I am totally comfortable there and made to feel welcome rather than an inconvenience as in some hotels.   Previously we used to stay at the Milestone, a sister hotel, also first class but Hotel 41 now suits me better.   Perfect."
June 2023,TIME TO RELAX and be SPOILED!!,"I chose this hotel because it was part of the a Leading Hotel of the World.  Upon arrival I have to be honest I was SO surprised at how tiny the check in area was. No lobby, etc, but stay with me.  We were warmly welcomed and escorted upstairs for check in.. Checkin in is literally in their small cute dining lounge. Again because we travel a ton this not the traditional expectation.   It took a minute ( about 20)  for me to adjust.  Our room was not read yet  as we had arrived at 8 am.  We decided to relax in this lounge/eating area and have breakfast. It was at this moment when I started to ""get"" the reason this was a Leading hotel.  First we had the loveliest Spanish girl check us in. When we sat for breakfast we were welcomed with a glass of champagne and then spoiled with‚Ä¶"
June 2023,Perfect boutique hotel in London,"The wonderful staff make this hotel- they couldn‚Äôt do enough for us +++. The signature scent is devine and permeates throughout the h√¥tel. Wonderfully comfortable bed, fabulous breakfast. Reception and dining area - gorgeous. Complimentary snacks 24/7, scones in the pm and champagne on arrival. Great location. Couldn‚Äôt fault anything. Lovely rooftop area"
May 2023,Hotel 41 - London ,"Hotel 41 is an incredibly special hotel. Truly a jewel in London! The rooms are warm, charming, and unique to the wonderful property. We are eyeing the conservatory suite for our next stay! A night under the stars! More importantly to us, as boutique hotel, guests become family members. The Hotel 41 team is amazing. They treat you like family, welcoming you as if they‚Äôve known you for a long time. Every time we left on an outing and returned to the hotel, team members asked about our day and engaged in genuine conversation. We also never wanted for anything. We never wanted to leave! Really. Highly recommend. We will return. Thank you to the Hotel 41 team!"
June 2023,The essence of traditional British hospitality service in its finest quality.,"I can't tell you enough about this jewel across the street from Buckingham palace, and I am a spoiled brat, staying at Ritz Carltons, Four Seasons, etc. In addition to all amenities that you get at a fine hotel of that level, it has all the character that one could imagine watching TV series like the Crown, including its fine hospitality service. It is located on the last floor of a six story late 19th century building, with its own entrance and door man. There is a lot of privacy in all areas. There is a private club lounge that serves fine snacks and drinks almost 24 h. day. There is a butler that takes care of you and everyone knows your name. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone that goes to London for a special occasion or to dive into the cultural experience. My‚Ä¶"
June 2023,Highlight of our trip!,"We stayed here for a mother-daughter trip to London. From beginning to end, we were amazed at the service and accommodations. The Executive Lounge area was the hub for meals, tea/beverages, and a place to relax and snack. We ate breakfast there daily and it was delicious and plentiful. They also offered a roof top area that we enjoyed amazing sunset views. The location was convenient and we walked most places including a bus tour that we caught a few blocks away. My daughter turned 18 and the staff really made her feel special with cards/notes, red velvet cake, and a gift. It was a very unique and overall exceptional 5 star experience. I would 100% recommend and would stay here again in the future."
May 2023,Can we say incredible!!!!,We visited London and chose Hotel 41 and can we say pampered and covered in luxury and caring staff!  Everyone made sure our stay was perfect and we had everything we needed in this boutique hotel right next to Buckingham Palace!  Just do yourself a favor and stay there!!!
June 2023,London Holiday,The hotel is amazing and the service exceptional. A beautiful stately hotel in a great location conveniently placed to access Victoria station.  The breakfast is in lovely old world setting and the quality of the food is fresh and prepared according to your request.  The rooms are also maintained to a high standard and there are no tell tale marks of wear and tear. The staff also take note of what you may have told them and we arrived back from Wicked show to have a message written on our mirror hoping we enjoyed the show along with a couple of macaroons with the Wicked logo upon them.  Just one of the special touches to enhance our stay.
June 2023,Spoiled by the best staff ever!,"Exceedingly attentive, friendly, helpful, and professional staff, from top to bottom.  The room was clean, had a very comfortable bed, and excellent A/C. We felt at home here in London for 6 nights. Would definitely stay again!!"
June 2023,Perfect (again),"I stayed with my son for a couple of nights.  The staff were, as usual,  the shining light of the hotel. Nothing is too much trouble for them - always friendly and very helpful. Bedrooms are immaculate and breakfast is top notch.  Another return visit is planned ‚Ä¶"
June 2023,Exceptional place to stay in London!,"It was my husband‚Äôs birthday and I treated him to 2 nights at Hotel 41. We were not disappointed as the room was superb, the staff genuinely pleased to see us and the breakfast was plentiful. A lovely haven not far from Buckingham Palace. You are greeted with a glass of champagne the minute you walk in to register! Even after coming back from a celebratory meal we had a cup of tea in the lounge and the staff produced a little cake beautifully presented with a candle for him! While I was there I booked a whiskey tasting experience which was very informative and they even gave us a little cake and a glass of champagne with there compliments as it was his birthday! It is a hotel that treats you like a family and gives you a sense of luxury with out being overpowering! The plunder‚Ä¶"
November 2022,Exclusive hotel,"Hotel 41 really is a unique hotel experience. As you enter the entrance hall and walk along the beautifully polished marble floors, and you are taken through to an elevator that takes you up to the executive lounge. You are provided champagne and canapes before checking in. The moment you arrive you are treated impeccably, and we were loved the intimacy of the hotel.    The room itself was lovely with some lovely finishes such as a welcome cake and macrons and overall impressions were very good.   Much to our own determent we had booked a number of experiences so did not fully use much of the hotel's unique points such as their plunder the pantry and evening canapes. We did however have delicious breakfasts when we could, and the staff were attentive and catered for any needs.  ‚Ä¶"
November 2022,Incredible incredible incredible,"Everything at the hotel was EXCEPTIONAL. The hotel‚Äôs crew specially. They were all very caring and always available to help. It is very well located, the rooms are excelent and very clean.  Only the higher of compliments and hoping to stay there again soon!"
November 2022,Luxury and personal,"Stayed for 9 Nights so I got to experience the service and hotel over a long period.   Ad you can see from the photos, the hotel is gorgeous.   On arrival, a beautiful introduction in their executive lounge orients you to the sensory pleasures that await. Their team, headed up by Diarmaid, set out to make every person feel welcome and that they deserve being spoilt with an exceptional and personalised service.   If you are visiting the Uk/London and want to spoil yourself, stay at Hotel 41 where you will experience many others spoiling you too!"
November 2022,Perfect (again),"This is our fourth visit to Hotel 41 this year - that, in itself, should speak volumes.  The staff are amazing and cannot do enough to look after you.  Prior to ‚Äòdiscovering‚Äô Hotel 41, we have stayed at all of the ‚Äòtop‚Äô hotels (Savoy, Connaught, Four Seasons, Shard, Ritz etc ‚Ä¶.)  but this is now our ‚Äòhome from home‚Äô in London. VERY highly recommended."
November 2022,Perfect stay,"Since the moment they open the door you feel like a home away from home. Their hospitality is exceptional. Every detail makes the difference when staying with them. Plus, the food is great and abundant. Walking distance from main attractions and their convenient advice is always  helpful. We'll definitely stay there again!!"
November 2022,First European Trip,"My Daughter & I enjoyed an amazing experience at this beautiful hotel! Impeccable service from the beginning to the end of our stay. Our room was definitely 5 star in every detail possible.   We were treated like royalty while enjoying complimentary champagne upon arrival, afternoon tea, wine & appetizers before dinner & also delicious English breakfasts!  The staff was very attentive, friendly & entertaining. We will definitely return on our next trip to London. Hotel 41 offers the best of every detail possible!"
November 2022,The hotel that exceeded our expectations,The entire experience was incredible. The check in was personal and easy and the welcome cocktail was much appreciated. The hotel itself was beautiful and comfortable. The lounge is very inviting. The rooms though on the small size were great.
November 2022,expectations exceeded,The service was the best that we have ever had.  We love boutique hotels and Hotel 41 did not disappoint. The rooms were lovely and the main room was inviting and warm. The location was a quick walk from Buckingham palace and Mayfair.
November 2022,Ruined!,"Attention grabbing but true. My stay at Hotel 41 was so incredible that it has certainly ruined almost any future hotel stay I have elsewhere. The purpose of my trip was a brief relaxation in luxury surroundings and it absolutely lived up to that. Although slightly overwhelming initially, the staff and glass of champagne soon help you feel comfortable.  The hotel and bedrooms were beautifully presented, but the star of the show, and the real differentiator, is the staff. The level of personalised service, genuine warmth and interest in you having everything you need sets this apart from any other hotel experience I have had.  I will absolutely be back in the future and can't wait!"
November 2022,A Unique experience,"How do you describe a stay that was so exceptional it boggles the mind? Yes, this hotel is not cheap- but it is an extremely unique experience. Everyone is there to make sure your stay is the best that it can be.  My room was beautiful- there is no other description. I asked for a referral to a place that had a nice Sunday roast - with an hour‚Äôs notice. Fifteen minutes later they found 2 perfect choices, I made my selection, and off I went to a lovely dinner at a fabulous gastro pub, after they secured a cab for me on a very rainy day ( with a printed map in case I wanted to wdlk) . Or perhaps my experience walking in to breakfast, and having someone following me with pair of scissors in her hand, mentioning that I had a tag hanging out that she could help me with‚Ä¶ Then there‚Ä¶"

September 2022,The Crown Jewel,"I can't express how much I loved ""the experience"" at this little gem. We arrived in London on Sept 28th for 6 nights for the Vikings/Saints game. My husband wanted to stay in Chelsea for the last 3 nights to be near friends who live there, but he allowed me to pick a hotel for the first 3 nights to celebrate my 50th birthday (and a belated anniversary gift).   Hotel 41 is the exquisite little sister hotel to the adjacent full service Rubens hotel situated in the heart of London, a quick walk from the gates of Buckingham Palace. When you walk in, you are warmly greeted each and every time, like you are a missed family member that they are happy to see You feel like you are in a 5 star hotel, without the arrogance of many 5 star hotels.   Your luggage is whisked away to your room,‚Ä¶"
September 2022,Love this hotel!,What a delight to find this fabulous hotel.  It is the epitome of English hospitality and service.  Small hotel only 28 rooms.  The service was 5 Star.  We will be back again the next time we are in London.  Just what we needed before departing back home to California. Marta and Stephen
October 2022,Best little hotel at the heart of London,"Very comfortable hotel at the center of London. Rooms are vey accommodating, beautifully decorated and very clean. Stuff is great, tending to all your needs. The lounge is great with snacks and beverages served all day and night. We stayed at the hotel for four nights and enjoyed it very much."
October 2022,This hotel will spoil you for every other hotel. Great experience!,"There is absolutely NOTHING not to like in this hotel. From the moment you arrive, till the moment you leave, you are spoiled and pampered. Everyone is going out of their way to make you feel at home. The beds are the best I've EVER slept in. The temperature in the room is easily adjustable, There is no noise disturbance, even if you may expect this in an old building and the service is above and beyond. The warmed floor in the bathroom, heating for your towels, a bath, the room was spacious, with loads of storage, safe and special cabinets for your smaller items. USB spots to charge your items, near the desk and next to your bed. Very convenient. I loved every part of my stay. The room is a great size for what I'm used to in London, but the lounge is just stunning. With‚Ä¶"
September 2022,"Very special small luxury hotel, but service is not what it used to be","This is a very peculiar hotel in the middel of London, set in the 5th floor of the Ruebens Hotel it has its own entrance and elevator, this is my third stay at the property.  Service is still very good and personal, but it takes forever to check in and out.  Rooms are on the small side, and the decoration is starting to look a bit dated (the black sofa on our room 4112 is worn.  Beds are delicious, but upon asking for dow pillows what we got was not satisfactory.  All in all still a very private and good experience, but not as good as the previous two."
October 2022,A fabulous experience,"We were treated by our daughter and grandson to stay at Hotel 41 as part of our Golden Wedding celebrations. We did not look at any reviews beforehand as we trusted our daughters selection.  From the minute we walked into the beautifully scented foyer until the time we left we were treated by staff as visiting VIPs - with no exception.  On our first night we arrived very late due to flight delays and as we sat down to a welcoming glass of champagne another resident asked if we had stayed here before. We explained this was our first visit and she said that you will never want to stay in any other hotel in London again. How right she was.  The food throughout our stay was excellent and we certainly enjoyed the complimentary snacks.  If you are looking for something special, this‚Ä¶"
September 2022,Excellent!,"What can you say about a hotel that is this amazing. Personal and excellent service 24 hours a day. Professional and discreet service from the moment you get up until you go to bed.  Food, drinks available 24 hours a day. Small gifts and hand written notes each night.  Beautifully appointed rooms and bathrooms. All this and a great location. I will definitely return."
September 2022,Prepare to be pampered,My husband and I ended a 3 week vacation  with our stay at Hotel 41.  It was definitely a 5 star experience.  We felt so pampered.  The staff anticipated our every need and we really enjoyed the ambiance of the executive lounge. We definitely enjoyed their team of professionals in meeting our requests and helping us feel relaxed in a new city. The hotel is very close to Buckingham Palace and is a great starting point for many other 'must see' attractions.  Thanks to everyone who helped make the end of our vacation just perfect.
September 2022,Three days of bliss,"It was lovely to return to 41 again and to relax on the sofa with a greeting glass of their excellent house champagne.  Owing to the pandemic, our recent visits have been reduced in number but we hope to bring them back to a regular pattern as time progresses.   Lots of new faces - again owing to the huge changes in the whole of the hospitality industry - and all the new staff are of the same high standard of friendly, efficient service as in previous times.    Only the best for 41.  Alex has only very recently arrived - a matter of a few weeks - and yet he conveyed a knowledge and attentive, caring attitude that made us feel as though he had been there for much longer.  Giving us his full attention, he still kept a discreet eye flickering over the room as a good professional‚Ä¶"
August 2022,The best hotel in London,This hotel and its staff are phenomenal. The rooms and attention to detail are fabulous. You are so well cared for from the minute you enter. The staff can‚Äôt do enough for you. Gorgeous executive lounge. We will definitely return. Massive thank you to all the amazing staff.
July 2022,"A most wonderful stay, pure relaxation and comfort","We decided to stay for three nights for our 10th wedding anniversary whilst we explored London and visited Goodwood for the races.  The standards of all our our service, the friendliness of the staff and the quality of all the good were second to none. Nothing felt stuffy, the staff were just all there to ensure we were happy and looked after.  We asked for feather pillows- no problem, we left our luggage with them whilst we enjoyed London on our last day- no problem, we had a parcel delivered a week after due date and they are posting it to us FOC- no problem.  No matter what time of day there will be tea and scones, arrival snacks, evening canap√©s that await you and in the evening when coming back from shows etc there is a wonderful pantry to plunder with cheeses, fruit, cakes‚Ä¶"
August 2022,A Perfect Hotel and well kept secret,"We traveled as an American family of 4 including 2 teenage daughters - with 2 rooms, one king room and one room with 2 twins.  Both were beautifully appointed with equal care and attentiveness from housekeeping. The location was perfect.  Close to Victoria station, easy walking to sites if you‚Äôd like but also always easy to catch a cab if you‚Äôd prefer. The service at all levels was exceptional. We particularly enjoyed that it was a residents only hotel that felt like our own private respite from the ‚Äúbusy‚Äù of the city.  Breakfast was substantial (not just American continental) and the other complimentary snacks throughout the day including ‚Äúplunder the pantry‚Äù added to the total experience.

Review of Hotel 41 Pending review I was traveling alone on a one night stopover in London on route back to the U.S. It was a rare moment to myself to breathe after spending 6 weeks, 24/7 with my teenage daughter and in-laws. But, I couldn't have anticipated how wonderful the experience at 41 was going to be.  It was like getting a brief chance to experience what I imagine life must be like for the Queen. As I walked out of the doors of this spectacular hotel and around the neighborhood, I realized that I was spontaneously grinning.  I couldn't believe my good fortune.  The staff at 41 are exceptional. From the moment I walked in the door I was met with sincere (but never overbearing) warmth, kindness, and a level of‚Ä¶"
July 2022,First Rate Hotel,"This is an excellent boutique hotel.  Our room was well appointed and clean.  The staff is first rate, friendly and helpful.  The ""Executive Lounge"" is an all-day and evening setting for food and drink.  The hotel is very well located in Central London.  One of our favorite hotels anywhere."
July 2022,Fantastic Experience!,This was without doubt the finest hotel I have stayed in. We booked direct with the hotel for a couples experience to celebrate my wife‚Äôs 40th birthday which was during lockdown. The wait was worth it. On arrival we were greeted by a friendly receptionist and then a couple of minutes later a gentleman came down to take us up to the main reception on the 5th floor. He was fantastic and offered us complimentary champagne and snacks whilst he processed our check in and made sure our room was ready. A few moments later he took us to our room and informed us that they had upgraded us to a suite. This was wholly unexpected and a wonderful surprise.  The suite was amazing with a separate living room with bathroom and a bedroom with a huge bed and sofas. It was spectacular.  The little‚Ä¶
July 2022,Week stay at the 41,I just finished a week long stay at Hotel 41 with my wife and we are totally spoiled.From the time we were greeted the first day by Steve and Esma until checking out with Adele we felt like we were members of the family.Everyday started with a wonderful English breakfast and ended with a raid on the pantry for snacks late in the night.Our room was very comfortable and surprisingly quite and very convenient only steps to breakfast.The shower being a bit small was the only negative.Everyone was very helpful setting up diners and buying show tickets.The location was excellent right next to buckingham palace.We walked nearly everywhere and the Victoria tube station was just a block away.We can‚Äôt wait to visit again.
June 2022,Felt like we were staying at Buckingham Palace,"We stayed in two rooms with our two teenage sons for 5 nights last month on a two week UK trip and this was a delightful place to begin our adventure.  It is like a little secret and we felt completely at home there.  The rooms are a little bit on the small side, but were perfectly appointed and oh so comfortable.  We loved the food, and experienced all the meals including tea at some point during our stay.  We also loved being able to get delicious snacks and treats all day and evening and just were overall delighted by the staff, the location, the attention to detail and the feeling of home."
July 2022,Best Boutique Hotel In London,"All the positive reviews about this hotel were right on.  Staff is amazing (Steve, Ali and Deryn) and makes you feel like family with every interaction.   The Executive Room is a great place to hang out with tasty snacks around the clock.  Regular rooms aren't huge but super cozy.  Location is great next to Buckingham Palace and close to beautiful parks.  Would stay again at this over-achieving hotel time and time again!!"
July 2022,Highly recommended,"We have visited this hotel several times recently and we have always thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The staff are amazing.  We had a slight issue on our latest stay (nothing major), but the hotel reacted perfectly to put things right.  My mantra has always been not too judge a business on an error or mistake but how they respond / rectify it - on this note, Hotel 41 went above and beyond.  We will be back soon ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
April 2022,Truly a hotel you want to experience!,"My wife and I just visited London and stayed at this marvelous hotel!  Its super nice and clean and the staff is impeccable!  Every detail is paid attention to,  and there is nothing lagging here.  It's a perfect location, you can easily get to the Victoria tube station in a short walk, as well as Hyde park and the palace.  The Hotel also has 3 restaurants attached that they own.  We tried the South African themed BnB grill next door and fell in love with it.  Definitely a good choice hotel to stay at!  We expect to stay here for all of our London trips!"
May 2022,I would never stay anywhere else!,"If you‚Äôre planning a trip to London please make sure you stay at the hotel 41. From the second you get there, the fabulous staff welcome you with champagne and your every need is taken care of , ensuring you have the best possible time . Steve is the epitome of calm and efficiency and always has a good tale to tell. Satish makes a mean margarita and Andrew is always good fun and professional in equal measures ! The rooms are all individual and unique with plenty of lovely extras all to enhance your stay so that you are already booking your next trip - on the journey home !"
October 2021,THE BEST PLACE TO STAY IN LONDON,I have stayed here  a lot  they have a thing called plunder the pantry for dinner time and there is judes farm ice  cream  the rooms are the best and confy beds  and good toileteries  it is close to victoria train station  the staff are kind and helpful and nice  they have coffie machines in the rooms  the brekfasts are good  i would recomend the pancakes and the eggs benidict  the rooms are really clean
April 2022,A wonderful club-like choice.,"A wonderful intimate hotel that feels like a private members club. The lounge is splendidly British, where you can spend hours as if it, in and of itself, was the purpose of the visit. Service is immaculate and the staff is beyond first class.  Cons: while bordering with Buckingham Palace, the street has a ""spillover"" sensation from bustle of Victoria Station.  Bottom line: Go, absolutely."
April 2022,Always brilliant!,"A quick 48 hours in a gem in a bustling city makes it feel like time is almost still. From the first Champaign upon arrival to the pantry our stay was brilliant. We decided to have breakfast both mornings and both meals were absolute perfection, every night was capped with cocktails in the lounge with sweets and snacks. We‚Äôll be back again soon!"
April 2022,Great again!,"We stayed 3 nights at the end of our 3 week trip, we have traditionally stayed here at the beginning of our trips and staying at the end felt really special.  This trip started in Milan which is the only reason we didn't stay here at the beginning of the trip, once again the service was fantastic.  We really think of this as our home away from home, which is pretty strange because nobody serves us drinks, breakfast, makes reservations, etc at our house!  Anyway, we really enjoy the location, the evening banter with Steve is probably our absolutely favorite thing.  Ellie was new for us this trip, but she was also delightful!    I took some time and read the negative reviews before I wrote this review, there aren't many so it didn't take long.  I understand some of the viewpoints‚Ä¶"
April 2022,3 day stay,"Stayed for three days and must say this has been the most enjoyable experience one could have ever asked for. From the moment you turn up you are the most important thing, customer service on a different level. Champagne on arrival whilst booking in, room top quality, plunder the pantry excellent for nibbles with drinks during the day. I cannot thank everyone enough for a fantastic stay.   Hotel 41 staff excellent customer service."
April 2022,Another Brilliant stay,It‚Äôs fair to say we‚Äôve stayed at 41 a few times. We treat this as our home-away-from-home in London. There are many great things: 1. The service level is always ‚Äòjust right‚Äô 2. The staff are brilliant and nothing is ever ‚Äòtoo much‚Äô. The fact that so many of them stay and turnover seems low says a great deal about the hotel and the ethos of the owners. I understand this as my staff only tend to leave when they have to. This keeps a stability and clients/guests love stability when they‚Äôre frequent users of a service. This marks 41 out against others who may choose to declare themselves as 5 star.  3. We‚Äôre not quite at the point of having stayed in every room but we have been in a lot of them and they‚Äôre all great with enough individuality to make them each of their own kind. I‚Ä¶
February 2022,"Exceptionally enjoyable experience, very personalised service, fabulous location and a taste of luxury.","Absolutely loved our stay, perfect location to explore London, however more importantly the standards of service along with the attention to detail, personal touches give this hotel the rating it deserves. Having stopped in many hotels across London this one is for me a favourite, the feel of a private members club. We will be back to plunder the pantry, delicious."
December 2021,Every stay is amazing!,"I've been staying at 41 almost every year for the past 10+ years, and I keep coming back for the amazing decor, the beautiful rooms, the unmatched friendliness of the staff and the level of service that is simply above and beyond every other hotel I have ever experienced. This is simply the best hotel, not just in London, but the world, as far as I am concerned.  A great place to stay year round, although my favourite time at 41 is always the cold winter months around Christmas to New Year's Day. The lounge is my favourite  place to relax at anytime of day, with a great selection of drinks.   The staff are amazing at recommending and securing dining reservations. I've had great experiences at restaurants I would have never found if not for the team's recommendations. They are‚Ä¶"
January 2022,A hidden gem,What a wonderful hotel this is and we have stayed in many London hotels.  The staff are phenomenal and make your stay so special.  The rooms are lovely and the executive lounge is very special. Staff are extra attentive and the food was fabulous. The afternoon tea was out of this world.  We loved our stay and can‚Äôt wait to go back. Very special staff who I can‚Äôt name all but Shatish who looked after us at breakfast was so attentive and kind.  Andrew looked after us so well throughout and the young man that looked after us for afternoon tea. The girls were lovely and always made sure we had everything. Thank you.
January 2022,Still our no. 1 Hotel in London!,"I don't begin to understand the algorithm that TripAdvisor uses to determine which is the ""best"", but I imagine percentages of scores and cost are high on the list of considerations. After staying at this delectable hotel about half a dozen times, I took it slightly personally when I saw ahead of our latest visit that Hotel 41 had been knocked off the top of the list. Upon reading some of the usurper's reviews I concluded that the thing that was missing from the no.1 hotel at the time is the one thing that makes Hotel 41 exceptional: the personal service. We're not rich by any stretch of the imagination, but seven years ago my now husband chose to take me to the top rated hotel for my birthday when he proposed, and the special memories created there draw us back every year for a‚Ä¶"
January 2022,An experience we'll never forget.,"Beautiful hotel, but the biggest asset is the intimacy and feeling the place evokes. This is a different League of experience that if you compare to other London attractions is actually incredibly good value in relation to the time you spend here. We were here for my wife's 40th and the staff made every effort to make it special.  If you want to treat yourself and experience london in style, I highly recommend this place."
January 2022,What a special place,Where to start! The staff at this hotel really make the best experience ever! From arrival to when you leave there is always someone to assist you.  We spent one night for our sons birthday. In his room was a birthday cake. Champagne on arrival by the fire.  The pantry treats are available all day then hot food in the evening with other delights too! We ate in the curry room in the adjoining Rub√©n‚Äôs hotel but part of the same group. Staff from hotel 41 took us to the restaurant through secret doorways! The curry room again was a great experience with champagne on arrival and more birthday cake. We returned to the executive lounge and spent the rest of the evening in a relaxed atmosphere with drinks by the fire. Talking with staff and in particular Andrew Muir. It was our‚Ä¶
January 2022,Wonderful Hotel,Wonderful hotel. Certainly deserves the 5 star rating. The staff were courteous and very helpful. The facilities were second to none. Great location. I would definitely recommend this hotel and am very much looking forward to staying again.
January 2022,Creating memories with Hotel 41,Wow what an amazing hotel.  My husband and I were totally spoilt from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.  Nothing is too much trouble and the desire of everyone to ensure your stay is perfect is authentic and very much appreciated.   From the fabulous upgrade to the tasty treats and first class breakfast - all the little touches are what sets Hotel 41 apart.  We have a weekend of memories and want to say a massive thank you to everyone.
January 2022,Just had two wonderful nights at the gem that is Hotel 41.,"Just had two wonderful nights at the gem that is Hotel 41. Not my first stay but my first solo visit to meet with chums for some post lockdown retail therapy. The amazing team made me so welcome, just like coming to a second home. As always the room was fabulous, with everything a girl could need and although in the centre of London I slept exceptionally well.  The food is great, the lounge larder is plentiful and extremely tasty, especially after a very tiring day shopping. The extremely thoughtful staff even made sure my room had bath salts and relaxation sleep spray to help me chill out. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel - simply put its wonderful!"
January 2022,Outstanding hotel and service.,"Beautiful hotel, with a lovely room and a wonderful lounge in which to relax and enjoy food and beverages. It also had by far the best service we have ever experienced, surpassing that of any other 5-star hotel we have stayed at in Europe or North America. Perfect for any special trip or occasion, and I greatly appreciated celebrating my birthday here. This is now our hotel of choice in London."
January 2022,Perfection,We visited Hotel 41 this past weekend for the second time. It was even better than I remembered.   The attentive staff and incredible service make this hotel the gem that it is.   All of the little touches are just perfection. I was there to celebrate my birthday and I felt so special and spoilt from the moment I arrived to the moment I left. The car journey home was even made better by the hot chocolates they sent us away with.   We will back as soon as we can find an excuse!
January 2022,Perfect 10,"From the moment you step into this hotel to the moment you step out- it's simply perfect. The staff make this hotel what is it. They welcomed us back with a smile and added a lovely touch by stocking a new non-alcoholic champagne- pink bubbles! We had another surprise with a complimentary upgrade; a stunning room with lounge, and the added touch of a welcome letter from the assistant resident manager Dean. Early evening, before our theatre trip, we enjoyed canapes and cocktails in the executive lounge, where staff are on hand to meet any request, discreet, professional, and dignified.  Returning from our outing, we were welcomed back as we plundered the pantry; duck, mango, and sweet potato fusions tempted us, followed by a slice of the famous hotel 41 chocolate cake, as the‚Ä¶"
February 2022,Just perfect,Usually we stayed in another 5 star hotel in London. This time we decided to stay here which was really a great decision. Its a small very familiar hotel with a unique concept in service. The attention to detail is incredibly!! The turndownservice with turning on the fireplace. Light up a candle in the bathrom and preparing the tv is unique. We‚Äòre definitly gonna come back in this hotel!
October 2021,Another impeccable stay at Hotel 41,"I travelled to London mid October of 2021; issues with the pandemic had made travel and accommodations difficult; however as always Hotel 41 stepped up to help me in each and every way. I had a significant delay with my flat rental and needed to find a place for an additional two weeks duration; the staff stepped up to make sure I was well taken care of and that I had a good place to stay for this extended period. The service was once again amazing. I can't rate Hotel 41 high enough, and give it my highest recommendation."
February 2022,Our love affair with Hotel 41,"It was a cold winters night when my husband and I checked into Hotel 41 having had an awful experience in another hotel that shall remain nameless, and that‚Äôs when the love affair with Hotel 41 began. From the  staffs attention to every detail, the cosy luxury of the rooms; the beautiful signature aroma; turndown with a hot water bottle;;great service; fab location‚Ä¶I could go on. We go back at every opportunity, and we live in London! Our favourite boutique hotel without a doubt!  Thank-you for the memories Hotel 41! Carol & Paul"
February 2022,Like a Private Club,"I travel a lot and stay in many hotels. I‚Äôve been privileged enough to stay in many exceptional hotels. Hotel 41 may be the best hotel I have ever had the pleasure of staying in! It feels like a private club. The hotel is small and exceptionally well decorated. The staff is beyond!, they each know your name immediately and  have a way of providing service that is warm and never stuffy or elite.  The room I had was wonderful with the most comfortable bed. I received personal notes and small gifts  each night of my stay. There was even a hot bottle warming my sheets when I returned at night. The executive lounge is amazing. Small but well appointed, it‚Äôs where you check in, eat breakfast, grab a drink or tea or whatever you want to eat. And after hours? There‚Äôs more food available‚Ä¶"
February 2022,Another amazing weekend at Hotel 41,"A huge thank you to all the staff at Hotel 41 for making Hannahs birthday so relaxed, fun and enjoyable. There is no other hotel like it, not only in London but anywhere around the world, and we travel a lot. This is the definition of relaxed top tier service. There is nothing to fault. Until next time. Thank you, Pete"
February 2022,Loved it,Noisy which was annoying but loved my stay at this hotel as staff were nice and my husband and I felt welcomed at all times would recommend any time as i will be coming back when i come back from france
February 2022,Perfect - 10/10 for Hotel 41!,"A wonderfully luxurious home from home - simply the best! Nothing is too much trouble for the amazing team at Hotel 41. From the minute a guest arrives until checkout - everything is superb.  Check in is the best ever with a complimentary glass of fizz, rooms are superbly comfortable with gorgeous Floris toiletries, complimentary chocolates & Nespresso machine.  In the evening there is either an a La carte menu and the lovely complimentary Plunder the Pantry - served at the table because of Covid precautions.  All in all - it‚Äôs perfect at Hotel 41 and my family & I love it!"
February 2022,Perfect Birthday weekend,"We arrived for my surprise birthday and I can honestly say it was the best weekend I have ever had. From the moment we arrived we were greeted with a glass of champagne. The room was perfect with everything you needed. We relaxed in the executive lounge in the evenings, in front of the fire with a glass of espresso martini along with the selection of evening snacks, including my favourite, the truffle Camembert. The staff were amazing! On my actually birthday all the staff wished me a happy birthday and I even received a little cake in my room. I can honestly say that this was the best experience and I will be returning"
February 2022,1st visit but definitely not the last ,"Booked directly with hotel and almost immediately received the customer preference email so was able to choose any particular type of beverage, or preferences that would make our stay special.  It was a lovely touch that immediately made us feel valued.    The hotel check in, from the front desk downstairs to the complimentary glass of champagne whilst taking in the rich surroundings of the executive lounge immediately set the tone.  The friendliness and attention to detail every single member of staff afforded us means Hotel 41 is somewhere we will definetly return.  The pantry with it's never ending supply of complimentary snacks is such a lovely treat as was the turn down service complete with lit fire and hot water bottle in the room, (much appreciated on a cold, damp night‚Ä¶"
January 2022,Great Hotel and excellent service,"The hotel is very well located, close to many landmarks.  Even though the hotel is central, our room was very quiet. The staff was very helpful and really nice. I think this is what makes this hotel special, the service and the attention from the staff. My wife was pregnant during our stay and we were upgraded (without any request) to a suite.  The breakfast was also very good. It is a la carte and the choice is pretty large. Overall, we really had a good time in this Hotel."
November 2021,3 Day stay,"I can say without doubt this was one of the best hotel stays I‚Äôve ever had and my wife and I have stayed in some nice places. The staff are without exception the friendliest people you could want to meet. The only way you can discern them from your closest friends are the uniforms. I would also like to give special mention to Steve Jones the Lounge Manager , a fantastic host. I would also like to mention the Assistant Manager Marlen for her assistance in booking up our next visit."
November 2021,Wonderful Hotel and outstanding service,"Thank you and your staff very much for making our stay truly wonderful, we enjoyed every minute of our trip from amazing welcome when we arrived to great service from all the staff during our stay. The attention to detail in the hotel and service was outstanding. We will definitely stay in Hotel 41 in the future."
November 2021,One night stay,"We stayed here for one night for a special birthday, all the staff at Hotel 41 were very friendly and helpful and made the stay a memorable one.  The hotel is discrete, but high class. All the interiors are manitained to the highest standard.  I would definately stay here again."
November 2021,A memorable experience ,"Fantastic hotel with absolutely fantastic staff.  Great location and really good rooms. Bed was superb, bathroom excellent.  But the staff make all the difference, and elevate the experience from a city break to something a little more special. "
November 2021,Amazing 41,"2nd stay at this fabulous hotel and it does not disappoint. Beds are so comfortable and the attention to detail is second to none . But most importantly the staff are amazing , so friendly and nothing is to much trouble. Have just booked again , can‚Äôt wait to return"
November 2021,41 has to be the friendliest hotel in London.,"This was our second time at 41 and once again it was outstanding. In our opinion the best hotel in London.  It was only fitting to return to the place we got engaged 12 months ago, for our London mini moon.  From the moment we arrived, the attention to detail by every member of staff was exemplary. We were made to feel so very welcome by Adele, Lauren and the whole team. This really is a special place. Looking forward to a return trip soon.  Thank you for making our few days with you so special"
November 2021,Fantastic Hotel,"The professionalism of the staff , the quality of the service, the rooms , location and the little unexpected touches go to make this one of the best , if not the best hotel we have stayed in and well deserved of the 5* Forbes rating.  From the moment we stepped  through the front door we knew were in for a treat.  We had two rooms and had booked for an Anniversary and birthday celebration.  We were mainly looked after by Andrew, who was very helpful , engaging and had a very natural flair , nothing was too much trouble and Dean who was also polite and attentive.  The small details for me are the main reason this Hotel is outstanding, the turn down service treats, the cake for the celebrations, the chocolates, the hot water bottle tucked in your bed to name but a few and not to‚Ä¶"
November 2021,Blown Away,"Well, I know a lot has been written about Hotel  41  but I just need to add our experience of this wonderful place.  We drove from Edinburgh to London, 1st time driving, and when we arrived at 41 the organisation was flawless.  We were met by a very smart red coated concierge and porter who just whisked our luggage away, and the car just vanished for the next 5 days. Super service and a nice welcome to both Hotel 41 and London.   We proceed into Hotel 41, again a lovely welcome from the guest relations and then we proceeded to the lounge.  On entering, again more warm welcomes and made comfortable in this lovely space.  No sooner had we sat down when we were approached by the lounge host, Mr Steve Jones, a glass of champagne was offered along with canapes, and we immediately‚Ä¶"
October 2021,Anniversary treat,"Superb service, friendly efficient staff. Lovely old english charm with comfortable, cosy rooms. Recommend the Curry room and the chefs banquet. Definitely be returning. The wife really appreciated all the little touches organised by the hotel."
October 2021,Amazing,"We don‚Äôt ever write reviews but felt that we had to for Hotel 41. It really is amazing. Special thanks to Andrew for taking such good care of our dog Chester and to Steve for the best expresso and bespoke Martinis. All of the staff are great, breakfast is outstanding, the complimentary pantry snacks are really, really good and the rooms/ whole place is just lovely."
October 2021,Birthday stay,Best hotel we have stayed at in the UK. Rooms were great as you would expect for a 5 star hotel. However it‚Äôs the service that sets the place apart from other 5 star hotels. Hotel 41 feels like you are a guest in someone‚Äôs home and all staff are exceptional. I must mention Steve who served us pre football and when we got back to the hotel. A great birthday treat in a great location
September 2021,Intimate wedding party,"My fianc√©e and I held an intimate wedding party at the hotel during the evening, and then ourselves and our guests stayed in the hotel overnight. The whole day was organised by the hotel manager (Lauren Hargrave) who could not be faulted, the service was nothing less than exemplary from her and her team, assisting with travel arrangements, flower delivery, transportation, dining and the overnight stay. The commitment, compassion, professionalism and service offered was unwavering throughout. The team made the day truly unforgettable and we will certainly be returning on each anniversary, to remind ourselves of a truly special day."
September 2021,memorable stay,"Stayed for 2 nights in the Monarch Suite which is a fine room overlooking the side of the palace. The hotel has a grand, yet intimate and welcoming feel. The staff here are on a different level. Everyone is really engaged and happy to spend the time to talk about the hotel and things to do in London. Complimentary champagne, scones, chocolates were welcome surprises. The location is outstanding. In 2 minutes we were walking past the front of Buckingham Palace and through to St James Park. Victoria rail stations are 5 minutes walk away. We ate at the BBar which is one of their restaurants next door. I had an amazing steak. We really enjoyed our stay and won't hesitate to go again."
September 2021,Exceptional stay,"Registration was effortless, having been offered a glass of champagne and nibbles, we admired the oldy worldly surroundings; fresh flowers, books, polished wood panels and soft lighting.  The black and white decorated bedroom included a king bed, writing desk, fire place, small sofa and coffee table, bathroom with bath and shower, wardrobe with plenty of draws and hangers, hairdryer, brolly, shoe horn, laundry bags, a safe dressing gowns and slippers. Coffee and tea facilities, along with sparking and still water. A celebratory cake, card and chocolates acknowledged a special anniversary celebration. The room was spotless and with a distinct sweet aroma in the air; the hotel 41 scent.  All we planned to do was relax and enjoy a change of scenery, switching off from our busy‚Ä¶"
September 2021,Another visit to The best hotel to stay at in London,Second visit to this wonderful oasis of bliss and luxury.  Far too long since my last stay courtesy of the Pandemic.  As before you feel like you have stepped into an exclusive club and indeed you have!  No standing at reception to check in like other hotel -  cases are taken at the main door and one of the many staff whisk you up to the lounge for you to recline relax and then comes the first dilemma.  You have to make a choice of either white or rose champagne.  On the house of course!  Andrew deserves special mention as he found and arranged a fantastic restaurant for our last night.  Since the pandemic a lot of restaurants close Sunday Monday -  something you just don‚Äôt think about when in the capital.  Any Restaurant 34 was terrific and thanks to Andrew!
September 2021,Superlative,"This was our 13th stay at 41 - and just wonderful.  Staff have been incredibly kind and helpful making our stay superb.   Room was stunning, food and beverages top notch, ambience to die for.  Wonderful position to explore London.   Cannot speak more highly and have already booked another three stays !"
September 2021,Exceptional birthday stay,"Wow!  Left speechless by the warmth and impeccable service we received.  From the time were contacted by Erica at the time of booking to the time we were greeted & shown around  by Nigesh, David, Dean, Steve, Alex and Marianne, everyone made us feel so welcome.  The afternoon tea, breakfast & free snacks in the exec lounge were exceptionally good. Plunder the pantry was such a lovely concept, not often seen in this country.  My requests for making the two birthday people‚Äôs birthdays special and  the halal food were totally taken on board.  Rooms are lovely as is attention to detail for the little things too. Book without any hesitation; you won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
September 2021,Regular visitor,"I make an annual trek to London to visit Hotel 41. This is a special place where your name is remembered. As a frequent guest I always get the same room, a junior suite. The service is impeccable. Drink with the general manager was a nice touch that was part of my rate."
September 2021,Without doubt the best hotel experience I have had in London.,All our expectations were surpassed at our stay in hotel 41. The service is exceptional and we were made to feel so welcome from the moment we arrived. We have been lucky enough to stay in a number of 5 star hotels all over the world and I am struggling to think of a better experience. They made my birthday weekend truly memorable and it is so nice to come somewhere this highly commended and not be disappointed. I could not recommend this hotel more wholeheartedly.
September 2021,Living proof that you can smile despite a mask,"You can't get better than this for these strange times as we gradually,  carefully, and with hope, emerge from the pandemic.  Team 41 take great care of their guests and their staff, ensuring safety with luxurious comfort and discreet care over every detail.  Being 'resident only' ensures no through-flow of people, and small numbers that are easily spaced.    We were in London for a small, private event and we returned to 41 for the first time since before the pandemic - the first time anywhere - a long gap, and we have missed its charm and dedication to the very best in hospitality.  To walk through the doors again was like being enveloped in a cashmere wrap, and the glass of champagne arrives with an even warmer smile. The mask can't hide that.    The weather was lovely so we‚Ä¶"
July 2021,Best hotel I‚Äôve stayed in !,"The decor is beautiful, bedroom comfortable and the lounge is superb. Very luxurious but cosy. Much time was spent enjoying drinks on the rooftop terrace ! On arrival we were greeted with a complimentary glass of champagne and thereafter there is a wealth of complimentary treats including chocolates, ice cream, scones served with jam and cream, evening canap√©s and sweet and savoury treats from the  ‚Äú plunder the pantry ‚Äú trolley from 8pm. Perhaps the best thing of all about the hotel is it‚Äôs wonderful staff. Everyone was so friendly , always addressing you by name and they were super efficient. Thank you all for making our stay so special."
June 2021,Exceptional staff - a very luxurious boutique stay.,"This was booked as a long post-lockdown treat, and, in line with all expectations ( in fact surpassing them considerably) we found the hotel, and staff to be truly exceptional.  First class attentive service, from arrival to departure.  We were always made to feel special, and this was a very personal and gracious guest experience- absolut5ideal for special and romantic occasions.  The location is superb for touring London, the west end and shows. In view of Buckingham Palace,  and minutes from Victoria Station. Food was superb, breakfast included and this was bespoke, plentiful and exceptional every day. In the evenings drinks are served with canap√©s in a small private club room. This is a very intimate and small boutique experience,  far removed from a Marriott or Hilton - do‚Ä¶"
July 2021,Perfect stay at Hotel 41,"Thank you so much for a fabulous overnight stay Hotel 41 for my mums 60th birthday! The little touches made our experience so memorable - the complimentary champagne and canap√©s, the birthday cake and chocolates in our room on arrival and the downturn in the evening to make our room really relaxing. My Mum said it was the best night sleep she has had in ages as the bed was so comfy and the room was so quiet! The staff couldn‚Äôt do enough to help us, and their friendly approach made us feel so welcome! Thank you - we will be back and we would highly recommend!"
June 2021,Hotel 41 another gem from Red Carnation,The staff were excellent and the service was of the highest quality. The attention to detail was superb. Location was perfect only short walk to the palace. Rooms were luxurious and spacious and the lounge was fabulous for a quiet drink and some canap√©s Would highly recommend this hotel as excellent value for money as having stayed in pricier hotels in London with less than half the service.This is the third Red Carnation hotel have stayed in and all have been excellent value and quality.
July 2021,Still Brill,"Our 5th stay at Hotel 41 - which probably tells you all you need to know - and it continues to remain our favourite hotel for the reasons that virtually all other reviews have listed. It's too hot for me to rehash all of these so whilst I go off and have a Solero, why don't you do yourself a favour and book it. Promise you wont regret it."
June 2021,Sanctuary in the heart of London,"We‚Äôve just spent three nights thoroughly enjoying the hospitality at Hotel 41. We stayed in one of the Executive King Suites, room 4114.  The hotel has the feel of an old fashioned private members club. The entrance is low-key almost like a speakeasy, nestled alongside the grander entrance to the Rubens.  We stayed during the summer heatwave, and the first thing we noticed on arriving was the chilled air welcoming us in, along with the signature scent that runs through all the public areas.  The room was great, compact but with everything we needed including a seating area and not one but two of the very best showers I‚Äôve had in a hotel room. We had a lovely piece of cake in the room on arrival too which was a lovely touch.  There is a nice roof terrace offering very good‚Ä¶"
June 2021,"Our new favourite London hotel - super location, exceptional service and nothing is too much trouble","We stayed at Hotel 41 for a couple of nights for our 25th wedding anniversary and from the moment we were offered a complimentary glass of champagne from the lovely Steve Jones in the executive lounge while we were checking in, I knew we were going to have a great stay. Lauren on reception was super friendly and helpful, assisting us with alterations to dinner reservations and the like.  The executive lounge is just beautiful... tall mahogony panelling & bookcases, a glass ceiling, stunning chandeliers and a complimentary array of snacks, ice-cream, canapes, cheese & more at various times throughout the day. As mentioned by previous reviewers, the executive lounge does have the reception desk, comp pantry,  bar, and tables where you have drinks, breakfast or meals but it's‚Ä¶"
June 2021,A Marvellous Experience,"We recently stayed at Hotel 41 for the first time and I can say without hesitation - we can‚Äôt wait to return!  It‚Äôs a beautiful hotel in an excellent location and overall, a marvellous experience - Thank you to the efficient, attentive and friendly staff that make it this way."
July 2021,Stay at Hotel 41 18th July 2021,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for the first time recently. It absolutely lives up to its reviews. You could select the attention to detail in the hotel, the exquisite rooms etc.   You may find equally stunning hotels elsewhere. What sets Hotel 41 apart from other places is simply the people that work there. The whole team is exceptional in their service, but it isn't obsequious.  They are just so friendly, and have evident pride in the place.   We'll certainly be back, as no doubt will others time and again. A hotel like this is difficult to replicate. It just works!"
July 2021,Fabulous hotel with exceptional staff,"You arrive at the discreet entrance where a scarlet clad gentleman welcomes you into the gleaming and luxurious foyer, and here your visit to this elegant - but not stuffy or pretentious - hotel begins.  In the executive lounge on the fifth floor with its beautiful chandeliers and shelves of antique books you are invited to enjoy a glass of champagne whilst you check in, maybe enjoying some canapes.  How very civilised, and exemplifies the way the hotel is run, with staff ever willing to help ""whatever, whenever"".    Do book a picnic in the park.  I felt like a princess for the day üëë"
August 2021,"Checked in as a guest,left as a friend","What can I say, just exquisite from start to finish. Welcome champagne on arrival before going to a stunning room. Beautiful touches, delightful executive lounge with very tasty canap√©s. Beautiful perfume throughout, found the whole stay so relaxing. Well done to Lauren the manager but a special thanks to Dean for remembering my name when pouring me a coffee at breakfast and to the lovely lady on checking out that sorted me out with Huggi bear. The whole team are a credit. I was overwhelmed when I left with the kindness I had experienced. Just an amazing find indeed. Don‚Äôt change a thing."
August 2021,An experience to say the least,"This hotel is a little bit odd. Sort of surreal and probably not for everyone. But I did love it!  Travelled here with two friends and my husband and had a wonderful time.  You have the whole of London on your doorstep but somehow know the best service you are going to get is in this little executive lounge.   The prices are admittedly a little ridiculous for me (¬£10 for a 330ml bottle of mass produced meantime beer from Asahi‚Ä¶.!!!!!!!) ¬£6 for a bottle of fever tree tonic to go with your ¬£24 gin (I cry)  This came very very close to marking it down BUT‚Ä¶.despite my complaining, the gin and tonic tasted better than they usually do, which harks back to it being about the circumstances that you enjoy your drinks!!  HUGE hats off for Dean & Steve who gave us fantastic service all‚Ä¶"
July 2021,10* Jewel in London‚Äôs crown ‚ù§Ô∏è,"An absolute jewel of a hotel, the service was something we had never experienced from start to finish this was a lifetime experience. Nothing to fault only to sing the praise of an amazing hotel. 10/10 on cleanliness, comfort and service can not recommend more."
July 2021,Like returning to see old friends,"We have been staying at Hotel 41 for nearly 10 years and it is out hotel of choice in London. This was out first stay since the pandemic and a long overdue rearrangement from previous cancelled trips. It was like seeing old friends, you felt everyone was pleased to see you and interested in how you had been through the madness of the last 18 months. We stayed 3 nights, had a lovely room and enjoyed every moment of our stay, thank you Lauren & the team. We chatted & laughed with every member of the team and enjoyed the roof terrace, the curry room, the bar at the Rubens and the Bbar, not to mention the executive lounge and all the wonderful staff, special thanks to Steve who has the same sense of humour as my husband. Look forward to the next visit."
August 2021,Best hotel experience ever!!!,"This was, by far, the best stay in a hotel we have ever had in the world.  Impeccable service from everyone, including housekeeping staff, from the moment you step though the door. These guys have bought into a culture ""we do everything 100% right first time, without fail, no exceptions"". You could spend thousands more in some London legacy hotels and never experience this level of hospitality.  We will certainly return and will highly recommend 41."
August 2021,Best staff in hospitality,"Without question the most attentive and conscientious staff I've encountered.  We've stayed on a couple of occasions and the wife and I always remark on how wonderful they are. The hotel itself is nice, and in a wonderful location for much of the city.  Highly recommend a stay"
August 2021,Exceptional!,"From the second we stepped foot inside, until the moment we checked out (and a little bit after that as my husband has left our car keys in the safe so had to go back into the hotel) the service was impeccable. The hotel itself is stunning and in an ideal location but, make no mistake, it‚Äôs the staff that make this such a wonderful place to stay.  We were given champagne and snacks on arrival and shown to our beautiful room. We had been told about the snack bar with crisps, chocolate and and ice creams to choose throughout the day. There were also other snack options available at different times of the day (plunder the pantry was most welcome after our theatre trip).

August 2021,A very special gem of a hotel,"This is quite simply the best hotel I've ever stayed in. Elegant and grand yet understated at the same time. The key to what is great about this hotel is the attention to detail in every aspect of your stay and that is down to the fantastic staff who cannot do enough for you. They make you feel at home whilst serving up many of the complimentary treats that are on offer, from champagne, to canap√©s, ice-cream and lovely little gifts left in the room. And the breakfasts are to die for, I particularly recommend the smoked salmon and caviar omelette. The rooftop terrace offers fantastic views across the Buckingham palace mews, and feels almost Mary Poppins-esq sitting amongst the chimney pots!  The executive lounge is a calm and relaxing environment, where you could easily feel like‚Ä¶"
July 2021,Little luxurious gem,"Stayed pre pandemic and loved it and promised ourselves our first trip away when restrictions eased would be to return to this little luxurious gem - Hotel41. Our second visit did not disappoint,  treating ourselves to the conservatory master suite- WOW it was fabulous.  The hotel is small but perfectly formed, lots of classic black and white decor, with gentleman‚Äôs club grandeur in the executive lounge. The surroundings are amazing but it‚Äôs the staff that make this hotel exceptional- each person is dedicated to making your stay a truly wonderful experience. We can not fault it. It‚Äôs in a superb location for everything London has to offer. We‚Äôll definitely be back and highly recommend."
June 2021,Top class hotel with superb staff,"A superb stay. The location of the hotel is perfect. The team are first class and make you feel very special, as if you are the only guests staying. The food is excellent and breakfast in particular is fantastic. We enjoyed raiding the pantry and having the canap√©s with drinks in the evening. A truly memorable trip to London."
May 2021,Beautiful hotel ran by an exceptional team,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for my mum‚Äôs birthday and had an amazing experience.  As you walk into Hotel 41 you are instantly greeted by the wonderful scent created specially for the hotel. It certainly adds a touch of luxury to the atmosphere and both my mum and I really loved it. The hotel itself has beautiful dark academia decor that is both unique and welcoming. The Executive Lounge in particular was striking and to be honest, we didn‚Äôt want to leave!   While checking in, we were given a choice of champagne and nibbles. The check in process was smooth and efficient and then afterwards shown to our room. The room itself was spacious, very clean and comfortable. We really appreciated the wonderful selection of teas and coffees that were made available in the room as well. I put in a‚Ä¶"
June 2021,A Much-Anticipated Return That Didn't Disappint,"Having first visited Hotel 41 last summer, my partner and I were so impressed we decided to return for my 40th later that year. The continued lockdowns scuppered these original plans, but the Hotel were superb about helping us rearrange, and keeping in contact with us as regulations changed.  We finally managed to get the booking sorted for this weekend, and it was frankly superb. We just wanted a nice, relaxing weekend, and the service and quality provided made sure that happened.  Our room was delightful, the breakfasts were outstanding and the afternoon tea was sublime - I couldn't recommend the Hotel enough to anyone.  I'd like to say thanks to Andrew, Adele, Dean, Erica, Lauren and Orsi (as well as all the other guys we didn't get a chance to chat with) for being so‚Ä¶"
June 2021,Delightful. ,"We were visiting London to buy our wedding rings and wanted somewhere special to stay. Hotel 41 is more than special. It is wonderful.  A unique place and a superb team make for a delightful combination. We enjoyed every minute.   Part of the uniqueness of Hotel 41 is the Executive Lounge which provides a hub in which to relax. Plunder the Pantry is a great feature, but the complimentary canap√©s are a lovely touch at cocktail time.  One of our favourite features though is Whatever Whenever. Not only a brilliant idea, but it sums up on two words the approach to delivering great service. "
June 2021,Brilliant Experience ,"There is not a grand palatial entrance to this hotel, but the staff treat you like royalty.  The whole experience of staying in Hotel 41 is a pleasure. The complimentary food and welcome glass of champagne make you feel very special.  The decor is muted elegance. The roof terrace is functional, but once again,the friendly staff make all the difference.  I would definitely return!  "
May 2021,It really doesn‚Äôt get better than Hotel 41,"Where do I start?  My experience at Hotel 41 was everything I could have hoped for and more.  It is such an intimate venue on one floor with only 28 rooms.  From the moment you arrive, everyone on staff greets you by name and you feel you have stepped into a club that makes you feel at home and like family.    They welcome you at the lounge which was my home away from home for 4 days.   I was then escorted to my wonderful room which was impeccable.  Nothing is overlooked.  The decor is all black and white from the carpets to the linens to the lovely artwork through the hotel.    While the room was amazing, it‚Äôs the customer service that will really make you not want to leave.  From Lauren, David, Steve, Andrew, etc.  They offer world class service that I challenge you to find‚Ä¶"
May 2021,Wonderful and much loved - The best!,"Wonderful hotel! The best! So glad to be back!   A fabulous stay at the wonderful Hotel 41 - absolutely deserving of the number 1 spot out of all the many hotels across London. Walking into the lobby you walk into another world of luxurious calm where nothing is too much trouble.  The rooms are all in a simple but luxurious black & white theme. The king executive rooms are large. I prefer the rooms looking out on the Royal Mews - Buckingham Palace Road. There is generous complimentary fizz on arrival, a complimentary ‚ÄòPlunder the Pantry‚Äô for supper from 8pm and breakfast is extensive delicious, there are complimentary canap√©s and toasties  from 6pm. You cannot be hungry here!   Highly recommended and much loved Thank you Hotel 41!"
June 2021,Perfection,By far the best hotel we have ever stayed in up town (probably the world!). Absolutely faultless from start to finish. Made to feel so welcome by all of the marvellous staff and nothing was too much trouble. Planning our next return already. Thank you Hotel 41 for making my husband's 50th birthday treat so special. 
April 2021,2nd stay just as good as the 1st,"Hotel 41 really is an outstanding hotel, this is our 2nd stay. The service they provide is fantastic and we enjoyed our visit as much as our last. There is now the great addition of the rooftop terrace, which we enjoyed in the fabulous weather. We have been fortunate to stay in some great hotels - Hotel 41  however really does top the list, a real hidden gem."
May 2021,Amazing,Me and my fianc√© stayed at this hotel at the end of may. We had the most amazing time. The staff where incredible and so helpful. The hotel and room where amazing. Also the experiences the hotel offer and the restaurants are super. Would recommend to anybody   Thank you to all the staff
May 2021,A midweek break to Hotel 41 over the June half term was a memorable experience for all the right reasons,"From the minute we arrived until the minute we left, our experience of Hotel 41 was a fantastic experience. The staff were always very willing to help and provided a high quality of service. What made it personal was the fact that they always referred to us by our name every time we had contact with them. The room was of a very high standard and was well equipped with everything you‚Äôd need for a luxurious stay. The  food and drink at the hotel was very good. Complimentary champagne on arrival, free canap√©s in the evening and free food from the restaurant available 24 hours a day, made the stay even more enjoyable. We have stayed in numerous hotels around the world and I can safely say that Hotel 41 ranks in the top 3."
July 2021,The best customer service ever!,"From the moment we checked in until the minute we left - the service we received at Hotel 41 was exceptional. It felt like every little detail had been thought about to make our stay feel as relaxed and special as possible. The hotel isn't big and the views from the rooms are nothing to write home about - but that  really doesn't matter as it is all about the experience. Every single member of staff was friendly, professional and couldn't do enough to make us feel welcome. Free champagne on arrival and free food and snacks everywhere. Certainly not the place to stay if you are on a diet :) But definitely the place to stay if you want to relax and indulge and receive the best ever customer service. Breakfast was incredible - delicious food, really punctual but not at all rushed‚Ä¶"
July 2021,Wonderful stay,This is without doubt one of the best hotels I've ever had the pleasure of staying in. It's small for a luxury London hotel with only 30 odd rooms and suites but that adds to its charm and allows the staff to offer a more personal service. Rooms are beautifully appointed and dressed in Hotel 41's signature monochrome. The executive lounge and rooftop bar are lovely places to have a drink and unwind with complimentary canap√©s. I came away fully recharged and on a mission to get me some monogrammed bed linen in my life!
July 2021,Luxury on London,"My second stay in this delightful hotel and it never disapoints. Great service from the staff, the rooms are beautifully decorated and very clean. The location is prime and only a short and comfortable walk to most tourist hot spots. This hotel and all the staff give you the personal service that makes you feel more than welcome. We can wait to return."
July 2021,Fabulous stay - nothing too much trouble,"What a wonderful hotel, I booked this for my 40th birthday after reading all the reviews on here and it didn't disappoint. All the staff especially Steve Jones who made our stay exceptionally relaxed. We stayed in a room just off the corridor from the Executive lounge so it was like a home from home. We will be back again!"
June 2021,Kyle's,"This hotel is exceptional, everything you could want has been thought off, the atmosphere is relaxing and friendly and the staff are a delight, nothing is too much trouble. Excellent attention to detail in the rooms which are beautiful. A real 5 star class act, super impressed."
June 2021,The best hotel I have ever stayed in!,"We celebrated my brother-in-law's 60th birthday at this fantastic hotel for a weekend in early June. I have stayed in many hotels but have never been treated to such  superb service as we have had from the staff at ""41"". The rooms were so comfortable, sporting the most comfortable bed we have ever slept on, with all the additions of tea and coffee facilities etc etc. The location of the hotel is within walking distance of  London Victoria BR Station and almost opposite Buckingham Palace grounds. The interior decor of the hotel is second to none. A warren of corridors regaled in interesting artworks lead you to the jewel of a reception area. Something of a 'gentlemens club' feel to the surroundings enhanced our experience to another level. We so much enjoyed the attention we were‚Ä¶"
June 2021,Best hotel in London,"My partner took me here for my birthday and we had the most incredible time. Nothing was too much for the staff, they were so attentive and friendly, the evening canapes were delicious and the breakfast was perfect. My partner proposed in the evening, and the staff made it so special (especially Andrew and Adele) and a completely unforgettable experience. I cannot wait to come back with our families. We could never stay anywhere else in London after having stayed here."
June 2021,Hotel 41,"This hotel is fabulous and is a secret that definitely should be shared! We had a wonderful stay and the staff, who were absolutely amazing, made us both feel very special.  We would definitely love to come and stay again."
May 2021,Amazing!,"Took my girlfriend for her birthday. We loved it! Fantastic room, fantastic service, the staff couldn‚Äôt do enough.  Complimentary food was such a nice touch and the breakfast was amazing! Can‚Äôt thank the staff enough!     I would recommend for anyone!"
April 2021,"An amazing hotel, with amazing staff - Surprise Engagement","Where do I start!  I planned to stay at Hotel 41 for a surprise proposal to my partner of three years.  Firstly, I have to say a very big thank you to all the staff for making our stay extra special. An extra big thank you to the General Manager, Mr Hendry, who made it his mission to ensure everything went like clockwork!  When we arrived at Paddington Station, there was a luxury Range Rover waiting for us with chilled bottled water, which was much needed due to the sunny weather.  When we pulled up to Hotel 41, two members of staff welcomed us opening the car doors and taking our luggage. We were then taken inside for check-in. You are then escorted up the elevator to the top floor where you are again escorted by a member of staff to the hotel‚Äôs own executive lounge. In the‚Ä¶"
June 2021,A second excellent stay!,"It is difficult to write a review of this hotel which contains anything but superlatives. My second stay saw me have the room I asked for and a chance to discover their terrace where I ate on my first evening. The rooms are brilliantly equipped with anything your heart  may desire, turndown service and luxurious toiletries.The breakfast menu and the quality of the food is outstanding.The service is discreet and impeccable. A real home from home ! Just go and enjoy! You would be very hard pushed indeed to find a better hotel in the whole of the UK! I have booked to return in September."
May 2021,41 really is our home from home in London,"We have been visiting 41 for nearly 8 years now and we were lucky enough to squeeze in a visit last August and have just returned from another wonderful stay.   It really is ‚Äúhome from home‚Äù for us and we are so happy to see that the majority of the fabulous staff are still there and providing such friendly, excellent service. We were lucky enough to have the sunshine which allowed us to go up to the rooftop and relax. Our suite was every bit as good as the last time we stayed and we can‚Äôt wait to book our next trip. Such a very special place ‚ù§Ô∏è"
June 2021,Just sublime,"We can see why this is a world class hotel. The staff are fantastic and can't do enough. From the glass of champagne poured by the lovely Mr Jones on arrival, to check out when I was advised where to get some Lucozade nearby for my sore head!! (We had got engaged the night before so it's allowed...!) A very good excuse to visit every year. Thanks for a lovely stay. Jess & Ben "
June 2021,The next best thing to home!,"I call this hotel ""The next best thing to home"" but in many ways it's better than home! The service is impeccable but in a friendly way that instantly puts you at ease... it's like meeting up with old friends! We've stayed here 4 or 5 times now, the previous time was about 2 years ago but they still remembered us even though our booking history wasn't linked (that's how much they value their guests). I firmly believe the reason they are the no. 1 rated hotel in London (besides the beautiful decor, the exquisite attention to detail and the amazing culinary talents) is due to the wonderful people, especially Lauren and Steve, for whom nothing was too much trouble. We can't wait to return!"
May 2021,An unforgettable Mini Moon,"First of all we would like to say a big thank you to all the staff at Hotel 41, Lauren, Gabriel, Dean,  Marlene, and many more staff, you‚Äôre professional standards will be remembered, from entering Hotel 41, each staff member called us by our names, wanted to know are plans for the day, and on return asked about our day out. Always on hand to help with everything. We had asked for a standard room, and we were overwhelmed by the upgrade- thank you! We were greeted with champagne and canap√©s, so fresh and delicious, just what we needed after our journey, we sat in the lounge while our bags etc were delivered to our room, sipping on champagne and relaxing. Then we went to our upgraded room- wow, everything was top notch! A lovely congratulations slice of cake, and a hand written‚Ä¶"
May 2021,Our number 1 hotel,"Still our number 1 hotel. Absolutely amazing service from the minute we arrived. Such a special place to stay to celebrate our daughter‚Äôs 18th birthday. The staff are so friendly and helpful. Nothing is too much trouble, from providing hair straighteners to blister plasters. The breakfast included was amazing, as well as the delicious canap√©s served with drinks, endless sweets and ice cream and the plunder the pantry was a real treat too. The new rooftop bar is beautiful with fantastic views. The perfect place to spend the evening and watch the sunset. Special thanks to Andrew who was especially attentive and took great care of us all over the weekend.  We can‚Äôt wait to come back soon to our favourite hotel."
May 2021,Best hotel in London,"Very exclusive calm atmosphere. All staff members are very tentative and helpful, in particular Dean and David. Whether you have champagne on the roof terrace or executive lounge the service is second to none. We stay in london once or twice a month and Hotel 41 is our new favourite. Can't wait to go back Pure class..."
June 2021,A FIVE STAR STAY IN A FIVE STAR HOTEL,Amazing hotel which deserves its Forbes rating. From the moment you check in where your suitcases disappear and then reappear in your amazing room you know your stay is going to be wonderful. We had booked as a birthday treat for my husband and were upgraded to the Monarch suite which the attached pictures do not do justice too.  All staff knew your name and we were treated like royalty which is apt considering the view from our window was the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace. We were even lucky enough to see the Royal carriage going out for a practice run for the Queens birthday parade.  The Executive Lounge was exceptional and the various complimentary extras are a lovely touch. The roof terrace was open as the weather was fantastic and they even provide suncream and‚Ä¶
May 2021,Didn‚Äôt want to leave!,"This was a very belated 50th birthday night away - goodness me was it worth waiting for!  From the entrance right through to the rooftop bar, we felt instantly at home, very welcome and most definitely treated us like we were the only ones there.  All staff members are incredibly helpful, smiley but not over bearing which is quite a feat.  Hubby organised afternoon tea and romantic turndown  - be prepared to be blown away by exquisite service and such thoughtful touches.  We‚Äôre booking a return visit very soon to enjoy the splendour and the hidden gem that is Hotel 41 and the staff; don‚Äôt ever change as it all completely works.  Thanks again and see you all very soon xx"
May 2021,"Fantastic service, akin to being treated like the Royalty down the road.","Amazing service, second to none.  Check in and check out are not rushed, allowing you to utilise the comfortable executive lounge.  The complimentary snacks bar and ice cream freezer were fantastic additions and breakfast was delicious, with a couple of options you wouldn't see everywhere.  Nice rooftop bar area too.  The only slight improvement I would make is, although the blinds and curtains are clearly enough for blackout purposes, just ensuring the blinds and curtains could close to minimise the amount of light coming into the room."
May 2021,A Little Hidden Gem! ,"I have just returned from a short weekend away with my 9 year old son in London. This was my son's first time visiting the capital, so I wanted to make it a little special.  Staying at Hotel 41 definitely contributed to making it a lovely weekend which we both enjoyed immensely. If you are looking for small intimate hotel with excellent attention to detail and service in general, I would definitely recommend 41. Both my son and I felt very looked after without any of the pretentiousness you can get in some 5 star hotels. My son is autistic so the calm and quiet of the hotel was a good contrast to the bustle of the city.  The staff are very friendly,  especially Andrew who will go above and beyond  to help, he is an absolute asset to the hotel! "
April 2021,Impeccable!,"How amazing to have had the most wonderful stay in London at Hotel 41.   From the initial booking to leaving everything was taken care of with such professionalism. The team at Hotel 41 are some of the most attentive and kind individuals of their profession.    The food was delicious from breakfast to lunch, canap√©s to dinner. With a vast arrange of drinks on offer along with a well thought out menu for food. My dietary restrictions were no trouble and I was very well catered for.   The staff were superb but a special mention to Steve, Erica, Svete, Lauren and Andrew. You along with the rest of Hotel 41 took such care of us and were so attentive. You really made our stay all the more enjoyable.  It‚Äôs not just the special touches that Hotel 41 provide (I won‚Äôt spoil it by telling‚Ä¶"

May 2021,Luxury hotel with great service,A hidden Jem in London on the 5th floor. Greeted with champagne as I checked in. The staff and attention to detail is exceptional. Breakfast was first class with a range of delicious options. Looking forward to the next trip.
May 2021,"Fantastic stay, outstanding service!!","The reviews aren‚Äôt wrong, the service at Hotel 41 is outstanding. I stay in lots of very nice hotels, all over the world and very rarely go out of my way to write a review. I couldn‚Äôt help myself with Hotel 41!  My wife and I checked in on Thursday and stayed until Sunday without the kids for a romantic, relaxing break. The first since lockdown 3.0    Upon check in we were helped up to the executive lounge, you are greeted with a glass of fiz.   The staff make this hotel so special, Andrew did a great job of welcoming us and remembered us from the first time we visited 18 months ago, so did all the other staff, checking you in, showing you to your room and making you feel comfortable.

May 2021,Just Heaven !!,"First weekend after hotels re-opened following easing of lockdown and we we were blessed to enjoy a 2 night weekend stay at Hotel 41. It is just ""Heaven"". No stress. Just calm and serenity throughout our stay, and the best staff ever. Somehow amongst an incredibly warm, efficient and genuinely caring team of wonderful people , ""Andrew"" manages somehow to distinguish himself as just exceptional.  From the moment you arrive and have a glass of complimentary  champagne pressed into you hand, to the moment you (sadly) leave, the attention to detail is just perfect throughout.  We  especially love Breakfast served in the room which is just brilliant. Food great and staff take so much care to set up the table and to make sure everything is perfect.

May 2021,Wonderful in every way,"Every single member of staff went out of their way to make our night wonderful. The hotel is stunning, It is by far my most favourite place and we have already booked for July.

Just Perfect.  Thank you in every way x"
May 2021,Couldn‚Äôt recommend more,We had a night stay here with friends and it was flawless from start to finish. The staff are the best we‚Äôve come across at any hotel and nothing is too much. The selection of snacks and extra touches were exceptional and we will definitely come back as soon as we can. The standards are so high and the staff are so professional whilst being friendly and paying so much attention to detail. Thank you to everyone for making our stay so special. If I could give you more than 5 stars I would
April 2021,An Amazing Experience,"We had the pleasure of staying at this beautiful boutique hotel to celebrate our wedding.  From the very first contact from booking and arriving at the hotel, everything was seamless and no trouble.  Upon entering the hotel the smell was divine, we were greeted at the lift by the receptionist and invited to check in with a customary glass of rose champagne.    Now that‚Äôs how you do check in !!  Our room was amazing fully appointed with the best smelling Floris toiletries.  This hotel is full of little surprises and extras.  Canap√©s and croque monsieurs with drinks in the evening.  The ever present and fully stocked plunder the pantry which was always different.    Our rate included an afternoon tea and what an experience that was, they have the most amazing pastry chef.   ‚Ä¶"
May 2021,"Exclusive, unpretentious boutique excellence","The staff are simply incredible at this beautiful, discreet hotel in the heart of London. The rooms are perfectly appointed and generously equipped. A great choice of food and drink, including a wonderful breakfast. Highly recommended for anybody looking for some unpretentious, exclusive boutique excellence....and did I mention how great the staff are!"
October 2020,Excellent hotel! Will certainlyCome back again!,"We recent stayed at 41 for our anniversary, the hotel and staff are amazing! The rooms are excellent and lovely. We enjoyed our stay so much we added an extra night. We will be back very soon and recommend it to all. We also did the picnic in the park, which is a lovely treat for couples, highly recommend as part of your stay. Certainly the best hotel in London, and worth every penny. We can't wait to come back and stay again."
October 2020,Impeccable Service & Hospitality ," We stayed for one night for my husbands birthday celebrations.  Check in with the added bonus of complimentary champagne!  The gorgeous decor, friendly and knowledgeable staff and all the little touches.  The executive lounge was a welcome refuge after a day out in London with coffee and homemade biscuits.  The level of service is second to none.  This will be a our new base when staying in London - absolutely loved our stay and will be back next month if Boris allows "
October 2020,If only all hotels...,"If only all hotels were like this. Ideal location, excellent accommodation, friendly, cheerful, efficient and knowledgable staff. First class catering and excellent guest 'perks'. More like a comfortable and welcoming club. No hesitation in recommending 41 to anyone looking for somewhere well above the normal 'luxury' hotel."
October 2020,5* and more...,"We chose to stay in London for the weekend as COVID meant we had to cancel our wedding and decided to make it a luxury experience. Hotel 41 is a very warm welcoming hotel in which the staff make the stay very personalised. Nothing was ever too much for any of the staff. My partner loved the evening turn down where they light the fire and add a hot water bottle in the bed ready for when you want to turn in. Breakfast is outstanding and the arrival experience was great. The hotel stuck to all the COVID rules and even catered the complimentary extras to our room as we were unable to stay in the lounge after 10pm. There was hand sanitizer around the hotel and the staff were always cleaning where other had sat and eaten as soon as they left the room. The rooms are cozy, bathrooms are‚Ä¶"
October 2020,Amazing!!,"We arrived at hotel 41 and from the second we arrived the service level and attention to detail was outstanding! Once we arrived we were treated to champagne and snacks. We were staying for my partners birthday and there was a birthday cake along with other little touches in the room which made it feel that little bit more special. The decor was stunning & we came back from dinner to the fireplace on in the room. I‚Äôd forgotten my hair brush and they went and bought one for me and delivered it to my room!! Amazing customer service, the little touches and extras make this hotel a hidden gem! We will definitely be booking again soon! Thank you for having us!! "
October 2020,Simply the best...,"If you want the best hotel, the best staff, the best service, the best food, then look no further. This hotel is the best. We've stayed in many 5 star hotels but after staying at Hotel 41, I'd say this is in fact a 5 star hotel and the others need to pull their socks up. If relaxed and friendly yet an exacting attention to detail is what you want then book here. We can't wait to return again and again."
October 2020,Lovely birthday treat,"An absolutely amazing hotel that puts other 5* hotels in their place.  From the ‚Äúhappy birthday‚Äù plate with a scrumptious cake in the suite, the tasteful decor throughout, the wonderfully polite, friendly and helpful staff, to the fantastic breakfast.....outstanding.    Nothing seems to be too much trouble for them and we really couldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel enough.    Thank you Lauren Hargrave and Andrew Muir and everyone who made our stay so memorable.  "
September 2020,Perfect refuge during difficult times,"My Wife and I have always agreed that the best hotel, in terms of service, that we have stayed at is the Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok. An opinion has not changed since we first stayed there +30 years ago.  That is until we stayed at Hotel 41. The service here is superb, from the warm greeting from all the staff on arrival and whenever you see them around the hotel,  to the fact that nobody asks for any details when you order anything but the bill is correct when you leave. No idea how they do this. The hotel itself is very cosy and has the atmosphere and decor of an exclusive London club. The Covid precautions are appropriate and reassuring and don't detract from the experience. Finally now is the time to visit London, very few people around, you can see all the sites without the‚Ä¶"
October 2020,Slightly disappointed,"We were here for our 1st wedding anniversary and upon recommendation from our parents, so as you can imagine our expectations were high. We took advantage of the valet parking for ¬£50 which although pricey saves a lot of time and hassle. One thing I would have liked, is that when we messaged the hotel to say we would like valet parking, they could have made us aware of the congestion charge now being applicable to weekends (this came into effect June 2020 apparently- how would a non-Londoner know this?) however upon checking-in, we were offered complimentary champagne and sat in front of the lovely fireplace and offered the complimentary snacks (Lindt chocs, nuts, Judes ice cream) whilst our bags were taken to our our room.   I was asked on several occasions (prior to arriving‚Ä¶"

October 2020,"Without a doubt, the best hotel experience!","From opening the door to saying farewell this hotel is simply exceptional. The staff, the quality of the rooms and service, the attention to detail and personalised touches made this a very special place indeed. After struggling to find a safe place to dine, we decided to go back to the hotel & had a great meal in the and a relaxed, (Covid safe), environment. I would highly recommend this as a place to stay and we will be back! Thank you Hotel 41 Team! "
October 2020,Fantastic- highly recommend,"Just returned from a lovely two night stay at Hotel 41. Great location, wonderful customer service and attention to detail. The hotel has made a lot of effort to comply with government guidance and adhere to the regulations. We were staying to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday and were not disappointed. Champagne on arrival at check in is a lovely touch and snacks are unlimited in the lounge. Breakfast was delightful and started the day well. Thank you to all the staff for their attentiveness and attention to detail. Highly recommend and will return."
October 2020,"good hotel , good food and very professional staff","good hotel , good food , the staff 5 ***** professional.  the price for the rooms excellent value  i would recommend this hotel  special mention to the cocktail bar and the Barman‚Äôs they are very good professionals."
October 2020,Outstanding service and hotel,"From point of booking through to departure,  our stay was outstanding. A welcome drink on arrival and the offer of snacks. Comfy rooms with extra touches, hot water bottle to warm the bed, chocolates, slippers and water. Cosy and peaceful nights sleep. So quiet! Breakfast was amazing with impeccable service from Andrew. The free judes ice cream, Lindor chocolate and sweet bags were very well received by my 10 year old daughter. Best hotel I've stayed in!"
October 2020,Perfect!,"Can only agree with others - this is an amazing hotel, the staff are all lovely, location is ideal, can't think of anything else to say! Will definitely be back as soon as we can and so glad we found Hotel 41"
October 2020,Unbelievably Brilliant ,"I really can not describe how wonderful this hotel is. From the minute we were greeted by the regally clad doorman, to our final delicious breakfast we were treated like royalty. Free Champagne upon check in, treats galore in the room, free snacks all day long, supper served on a tray to the room (all complementary!!) The room itself (executive King - was spacious, elegant and soooooo comfortable) The decor in the executive room is elegant, resplendent of Downton Abbey. The breakfasts are truly the best I‚Äôve ever had with friendly, gracious waiting staff - a particular thanks to Dean, nothing was too much trouble. We spent three magnificent nights here and left, although a little downhearted, rested, energised and totally relaxed.....  I suggest anyone looking for 5 star luxury‚Ä¶"
October 2020,Don‚Äôt make us go home...,"Well it‚Äôs all been said a million times before but we may as well echo what many others have said before us... the service here is what sets it apart from other hotels. It‚Äôs warm, personable and charming from the moment you arrive and until you sadly leave.  A special mention to Andrew who took such good care of us and to David who treated my little girl like a rockstar for the evening - she had the time of her life making her mocktail!  This was a splurge for us and I was nervous about paying a large amount money for a 1 night stay in a hotel - but now, on the train home, I can honestly say I‚Äôm perfectly content with a the ding in my bank balance.  Nothing was too much trouble - we arrived super early and were given champagne (a lemonade for my little girl) and with in a few‚Ä¶"
October 2020,Treated like royalty,"Was originally booked into Rubens, but due to the pandemic, we were upgraded to Hotel 41. From the minute we walked in, our suitcase and coats were taken to our room, and check in in the lounge was so leisurely. Champagne & canapes on arrival, and then shown to our room. So luxurious and comfortable, the bed and bedding made us feel like staying in bed all day. Turn down service at night , and the fire was lit. Excellent breakfast in the lounge, where we also ate dinner as we did not feel like venturing too far. Although my partner's birthday was in July, this was a treat for her as I mentioned in my e mail to the hotel, and she had a birthday cake and chocolates in the room. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Would definitely recommend and stay again if possible."
August 2020,Bijoux and Gorgeous,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for a family birthday (89 years old!). From booking all the way to departure, the service was excellent. On arrival we were given Champagne and canapes to aid check in. And a wonderful birthday cake for our guest of honour. Our rooms were lovely, spacious, elegant bathroom products, a small box of chocolates (didn't last long!). COVID precautions were taken seriously so breakfast was served to table but the choice was excellent.  Would highly recommend (and save room to plunder the pantry at the end of the evening! Cheese and Port is a must!)."
October 2020,Been said before and worth saying again,This was my first time away since lockdown so I was slightly nervous. I wanted some time to chill and relax and there could be no better place than hotel 41. I'd researched it well and felt it took covid seriously. I did feel very safe.  The staff here are lovely and it is true they all remember your name even those who have not met you before. Every single member of staff was delightful and helpful  although Andrew did particularly stand out. I have stayed in a few 5 star hotels and although the hotels were special this really was the first hotel where I was made to feel special all the time.   Nothing seemed rushed. It was the perfect  place when travelling alone with the wonderful lounge space and its abundance of free goodies. The time I stayed it was very wet so lovely to‚Ä¶
September 2020,Special birthday treat,"An amazing experience from start to finish. Lots of helpful communication from the hotel in advance about how they are addressing the Covid situation and regulations. Exceptionally attentive staff who immediately recognised that I am deaf and need to lipread so they discretely lowered their masks when they needed to speak to me - all very respectful and fuss-free which meant a lot.   We had an upgrade to one of their two suites which was an extra special treat. No view from the room but we weren‚Äôt their to look out of a hotel window so it really didn‚Äôt matter.   We loved the boutique, small and quirky style of the hotel. It was immaculately and stylishly furnished and decorated throughout.   It truly lived up to its reputation as the best place to stay in London. We can‚Äôt‚Ä¶"
September 2020,"100% reccomend Hotel 41, 5*","Our stay at Hotel 41 was perfect. From the complimentary champagne on arrival to be made to feel very comfortable and welcomed. The complimentary snacks was a lovely touch, the staff were very helpful and polite. We stayed in the the executive King suite, was amazing. Great size room, extremely clean and tidy, in particular we loved the bathroom! We would definitely recommend and stay again!"
September 2020,Wedding night,"One of the best hotels we have stayed in. First class service. Fantastic location. Amazing rooms and design. We stayed here for our wedding night as we wanted to stay somewhere special close to Victoria. Hotel 41 exceeded expectations. Late check-in, glasses of champagne on arrival. We were upgraded to the Conservatory Suite, which is incredible. It was a fleeting visit as we had a flight to catch the next morning - we only wish we could have stayed longer.  Highly recommend."
September 2020,"So good I added two extra nights to my stay, however","Currently staying at Hotel41. I'm spending about ¬£1000 in total here. I'm a solo female traveller and it feels like nothing is too much trouble, the staff are amazing and really friendly. I booked in for a weekend of relaxation because of a stressful home situation.  However I've just had a call to my room regarding hair dye on towels.  My hair is bright red and has been since I was 19, getting on for 10 years. Its notorious for washing out quickly, and when I wash my hair it shows in the water. If towels are white, it shows on them in  pale pink.   In all the time I've had red hair, I've stayed in probably 100 hotels, all 4* up. I've never, ever had anyone call my room about my hair.   Not once, in almost a decade. Generally these hotels all use white towels. My hair dye isn't‚Ä¶"
August 2020,Are you kidding?? Wow!!,"I want to preface this review by saying that I am not a fancy person, nor do I know how to act in fancy ways. Haha. I've worked in restaurants and get a little uncomfortable when I'm on the other side of the table in a nice place, but let me tell you, right from the get go, you are floored by the service!! Ahhhhhhhh!   My partner had booked us in, and he spoke to Maria through email about a few things to customise our stay. She was polite and kind. Even with last minute requests.  When we arrived, Maria greeted us and we were guided to floor 5 where we went straight to the executive lounge. I believe it was Marlen that greeted us and Adele who was working at the desk. Mohan tended to our table and we were greeted with rose champagne and little snacks. We decided to stay for‚Ä¶"
September 2020,Birthday weekend away. ,"Hotel 41 has been by far the best hotel I have stayed at in the UK, and beyond. The service was impeccable. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, the personal touches could not be faulted. From the moment we arrived the staff were welcoming, and made us feel as though we were the most important people around. The food was great, cocktails were amazing, the architecture was incredible, all the little extras were of the highest quality. Andrew took care of us and went above and beyond what I'd expect. The rest of the staff were just as amazing and made our stay the most memorable and it was a pleasure to stay here. We will certainly be returning and cannot wait to stay at this venue again. "
September 2020,The Highlight of our Year,"To celebrate our Diamond Wedding Anniversary and my Wife's 80th Birthday we originally booked to stay at The Rubens at the Palace in April but Covid spoiled all that.  We subsequently rebooked for early September but were informed prior to our visit that we had been upgraded to a sister hotel, namely Hotel 41, which just happens to occupy the entire 5th. floor of The Rubens building with it's own entrance and direct access lift. This resulted in our experiencing a 3 night break in a fabulous location. To add further to our pleasure on arrival we found that we had been further uprated to an Executive King room. Bliss !! From the time we arrived to our departure we were in receipt of the highest service levels from an exemplary Staff who really got to know us personally, we were‚Ä¶"
September 2020,A hidden jewel,"We unexpectedly stayed here on route home for one night and cannot recommend this hidden jewel highly enough. We had been upgraded from their sister hotel and we had been slightly concerned that a hotel with such high credentials would feel uncomfortable and potentially pretentious but this was absolutely not the case. The serrvice, rooms and foid were a treat although we couldn't do the 24hour grazing pantry justice. We will definitely return...for a treat."
September 2020,Wow! What a stay,"We booked a stay here for our Wedding Anniversary.  Well i read the reviews, before making a choice of where we would stay. We come to London very often and have stayed in many hotels over the last 20 years. I have to say that our stay here was very different and very refreshing.  Great location and to say the service is fantastic is an understatement. Genuinely friendly service, from all staff. The hotel is very comfortable and has thought of it all.  We only stayed one night which was far too short, but we will definitely stay again. Andrew was a member of staff that really added a special touch to our stay, friendly and helpful where nothing was too much trouble.  What a fantastic hotel!"
September 2020,Amazing stay at Hotel 41,"Stayed here for anniversary weekend and had such a relaxing enjoyable stay. The staff are attentive but not in your face, they are very polite and always know what you want before you do! I would absolutely recommend this hotel, great location, will definitely return. For a completely flawless stay in London this has to be the place to stay, the reason they are the No.1 of Trip Advisor is very easy to see. Thank you Hotel 41 for an amazing weekend!"
August 2020,Just as good the 2nd time,"We first stayed at Hotel 41 about 5 years ago and loved it. Wanting a brief staycation - we live in the East End of London - we booked 2 nights over the recent bank holiday weekend. This was our first time in a hotel in the COVID19 world and we were expecting it to feel pretty weird. The greatest credit to the team at Hotel 41 is it didn't feel weird at all. Apart from the requirement to wear facemasks in public areas, it felt normal. More than that though, it felt safe. It was clear precautions were being taken (for example, staff wore masks when they came close to you) and the lounge was set up for safer distancing.  And, onto the room. Just beautiful. Spotless. A really comfortable bed. Nice coffee and tea. Great bathroom. Penhaligons toiletries. And, as a same sex couple,‚Ä¶"
September 2020,This hotel is a gem! ,"This hotel is an absolute gem! We arrived for a one night stay to celebrate our anniversary.  Upon arrival we knew we had found something very, very special.  The staff were so welcoming and our car was promptly valet parked without a hassle.  One person who should receive a massive amount of credit is Andrew.   All the staff went over and above to make our stay special but Andrew really did go that extra mile.  His professionalism knows no bounds and we have never received service like this any any hotel we have stayed in around the world! The rooms were stunning and extremely comfortable.  The bar area was so special as it was for guests only and every whim was catered for! A lovely snack menu, a sweet buffet and endless supply of ice cream.  What a treat!  If you want to be‚Ä¶"
September 2020,Simply wonderful ,My husband and I were celebrating his birthday and our belated anniversary. We couldn‚Äôt have ask for a better surprise as we were upgraded to an amazing suite.  The staff here were just lovely and attentive and nothing was too much trouble. we decided just to stayed at the hotel as it was just perfect to relax and do nothing. I honestly think it‚Äôs was one of the best hotels we‚Äôve had the pleasure to stay at and I‚Äôm sure that I would love to stay again for another very special occasion. 
August 2020,Great place to stay (with or without dogs),"This hotel cannot be faulted.  We were greeted by all members of staff that we saw on our way in and treated to some lovely canapes and glass of bubbly whilst checking in. We had a great room that accommodated myself, husband and our 2 labradors. The dogs were left some treats, beds to use and bowls.  Room very well appointed and seemed easy to request anything, if necessary..  Food was very enjoyable. A great choice at breakfast and the evening meal was lovely ( a good variety of dishes to choose from) Would stay again."
August 2020,"Birthday staycation , amazing hotel","We had actually booked to stay at the Rubens hotel , we had 2 rooms to celebrate 2 50th birthdays. Unfortunately due to the impact of Covid the hotel was not open and so we were contacted in advance and switched to hotel 41. Having walked passed the Ruben many times when visiting London I had never even noticed hotel 41. What an amazing place to stay , the staff cannot do enough for you, they contact you in advance to take care of any request, and the complimentary champagne on arrival was a real treat.   There are some things they needing to do differently due to Covid , which means all the treats in the pantry are pre bagged, but that's probably a good thing as otherwise you may have too many treats.   The rooms were lovely , with special touches to make the stay even more‚Ä¶"
August 2020,A birthday staycation done right!,"What is extraordinary with this hotel, which has been echoed in many reviews, is the level of service. Soon as the booking was made, the hotel got in contact, fussing over every detail for my visit. And they delivered! (I stated my dietary preference and they managed to source halal chicken for my stay). Nothing was any trouble to the team! The room is spacious, perhaps one of the biggest ones in London and well equipped. The Executive Lounge, which also serves as the reception area, is gorgeous and cozy. There is also access to the rooftop, weather permitting. And whoever came up with the idea of 'Plunder the Pantry' should win an award or a few. A special shoutout to Emma, Maria, Andrew, and David who made me feel welcomed here. Repeat visits are necessary!"
August 2020,A wedding anniversary stay at a wonderfully charming hotel,"From start to finish, the staff at Hotel 41 could not have made this occasion any more special and so very memorable. We were so well looked after by all the staff, and this establishment is a true gem in the heart of London. We were totally smitten with the decor and the finer details, particularly the Monarch suite we were upgraded to for our anniversary stay. We will definitely be coming back to stay again at this wonderful and charming hotel. Our anniversary meal at the Bbar restaurant next door to the hotel was delicious and we highly recommend it. A special thank you to Joanna, Maria and Sarah who went out of their way to ensure every request was taken care of at the highest standard - their communication in the week up to our stay was outstanding and very efficient."
August 2020,Special Anniversary at Hotel 41,"Some hotels have to  boast about their staff, faciities and service. Hotel 41 speaks volumes in its class, distinction and unreserved attention to detail. Us mere mortals on an anniversary stayover in London, could not believe our luck. We were shown consideration from the time we made the booking, care had been taken in keeping us informed of changes and  details; although the surprise to us was the luxurious upgrade and compliments  from the hotel and staff when we got there!  Hotel 41, is situtaed in a delighful part of London, we giggled in the tube station at the sign that said Buckingham Palace this way, as we headed home to it for the  evening so near to the hotel. The hotel gives you all the comfort and luxury worthy of the jewel in the 5 star crown that it is.  Other 5‚Ä¶"
August 2020,41. It‚Äôs what a ‚Äò5‚Äô really looks like!,Hard to imagine how you could find a better hotel in London. Absolutely perfect in all respects. Every single member of staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome. We chose 41 because it was the top-rated hotel on Trip Adviser and it‚Äôs a well deserved title. Like other reviewers it‚Äôs beginning to sound like I‚Äôve been paid to say this but I genuinely have not! Never reviewed a hotel in my life but I‚Äôm moved to do it this time. Thanks to everyone at 41 for making our weekend so memorable.
August 2020,Anniversary weekend ,"Has to be the best customer service hotel I have ever stayed at. Hands down the best experience we have ever had. The food was awesome, breakfast snacks and desserts. Whilst the food options are served rather than help yourself at the moment to ensure good social distancing. Bottomless ice cream was available but the rest of the food was so good I did not leave much space. The room we had was a split level junior suite which was very well equipped. The turn down option was well done with fresh flowers and slippers and sweets. Bottled water in the fridge and a Nespresso machine topped up on request. I had about 6 coffees a day . The bathroom was the same size as a double bedroom. Fantastic water pressure from the shower and the bath filled in about 2 minutes. 3 TVs 1 in the‚Ä¶"
September 2020,Great Staff make the difference,"Great location for trip to London, the service is excellent from arrival to departure we could not fault the service, the attitude of the staff and atmosphere of the hotel.  The break was very relaxing, with drinks on roof top bar, snacks in the lounge, every detail has been though through and execute to extremely high standard - we will be back and would highly recommend"
September 2020,Simon Harrap,Hotel 41 lived up to its review status. From the moment you arrive at the door the service is 100% and more. On arrival they welcomed us with our names and were shown to the executive suite for welcome drinks and to register. Our room was ready but we were welcomed with champagne and food. This is how the whole experience carried on until we left. It was just one magical friendly hotel and felt like we were the only people that mattered. Nothing was ever wrong and nothing was a hassle for the colleagues or for us In the hotel.  This is clearly the best hotel our family have stayed in over many hotels in this country or abroad we have stayed in.  Thank you for an amazing experience 
September 2020,Exceeding expectations,Stayed for 3 nights in conservatory suite.This is a beautiful large room on two levels a haven in the centre of London. This is a great hotel for a luxury break with so many complimentary treats a quiet main bar/dining area but top of the list has to be the staff who cannot do enough to make the stay whatever you request is made possible & they are simply the best you could find anywhere. We will return soon to our home from home
September 2020,A superb few nights,"My partner and I stayed for 2 nights and were made to feel very welcome. A complimentary glass of champagne whilst you are checking in and a variety of nibbles were a lovely touch. The staff are great, very attentive but not gushing. The room was comfortable and had lots of nice touches that were appreciated. We have both stayed in lots of hotels in London and would rank this in our top 5."
September 2020,Very Nice,"We visited Hotel 41 for 3 nights. We originally should have stayed at Rubens next door but sadly that closed temporarily ( however it does look lovely and we would still like to stay there eventually) we were allocated The Balmoral suite which was amazing, beautifully decorated and very comfortable beds and pillows. The turn down service was an added bonus. All members of staff were helpful and friendly. The Plunder pantry was a nice touch, I imagine pre COVID as a buffet it was spectacular. We used the roof top terrace one afternoon and it is a lovely sun trap, nice to relax with a glass of wine. Upon arrival everyone is offered complimentary champagne, a lovely welcome. Champagne was continued to be offered which we accepted, maybe a polite word informing us that these further‚Ä¶"
September 2020,6 star staff,"6 star staff customer service is excellent here we arrived to Landon champagne doors opened and closed for us our room set up with just what we asked for inside it the bedding and best best beds in London luxury linen and carpets and drapes, their was a few cleaning issues which I only wrote on a questionnaire because they were so good shower door dirty at the bottom and on one of the draws other than that they make u feel more than at home , after returning to the hotel after a day in London we went to the executive lounge to have toastier and canap√©s which is brilliant though I thought as it was an executive lounge you‚Äôd get lattes into the price but no do be careful as we ran a bar bill which we should of asked about as I assumed wrongly the lounge is lit with candle light‚Ä¶"
September 2020,Fantastic place and staff,Can‚Äôt praise our stay with Hotel 41 highly enough.  This was like no other hotel stay. It was such a great experience and we felt so well looked after by the friendly staff with such thoughtful little details added in too. There were 5 of us in our group staying in 3 rooms and we all loved it!!
September 2020,Amazing Hotel,I had booked to stay at the Rubens hotel but we were upgraded to Hotel 41. We stayed for 2 nights as had a day trip booked on the British Pullman.  This is an absolute gem of a hotel and we could not a fault anything. The staff were extremely friendly and could not do enough for you.  We were travelling with friends and I would personally like to thank them for upgrading them on their second night to the Conservatory Suite as a special treat due to personal reasons that I had informed them of before we had arrived. This made our stay even more special and we shall cherish these memories forever. 
September 2020,The most fabulous hotel.,"We can honestly say that this was a faultless stay. The hotel was perfectly situated, the building and facilities were immaculate, the breakfast was of the highest standard. But what made our stay so good, was the attentiveness of the staff. All the staff took the trouble to learn our names, chat to us about our stay, understand why we came to London and then went out of their way to help in any way possible. It‚Äôs only a little think, but that extra effort made it feel like a very special stay.   We believe this hotel sets a benchmark in hospitality that we have not seen anywhere else."
September 2020,Excellent Hotel,I have been visit London 6 times in different Hotels and this was the best one. Very friendly and professional staff.  They have an eye for details. Everything was excellent and the hotel is a jewel in London.  This was my best stay in the city. I will come back as soon as possible.
October 2020,Superb Hotel,"What a hidden gem! Fantastic facilities and rooms and the best customer service I have experienced in all my years of travel. We loved the ambience of the lounge and all the complimentary goodies, a shame we didn't try all the ice cream flavours, next time! Thank you for making our birthday stay truly memorable."
October 2020,Birthday Treat,This was the most amazing stay!! The staff were delightful and so lovely and could not have done more for us! ! We did not want to leave at all and was sad to go. We will definitely be back!! Thank you so much for having us!!!
October 2020,Sometimes its the little things...,"This hotel is superb for so many reasons but there are 2 main standouts: the outstanding service from each and every member of staff and the ""little touches"" that just set this a cut above. It starts with a glass of champagne and delicious little snacks on arrival and the five star treatment doesn't let up. From a candle being lit in your bathroom in the evening, and finding a hot water bottle has been put in your bed whilst you are at dinner.... through to a complimentary power juice shot in the mornings and Wedgewood china for in room hot beverages. I love how everything is 41 monogrammed - right down to the froth on your cappuccino. The staff were attentive, professional, polite and great fun too. Am already looking for an excuse to go back...."
October 2020,Impeccable service and  generous hospitality,"I stayed in Hotel 41 for business purposes with fellow colleagues for two nights.  The hotel group boasts that they are renowned for impeccable service and generous hospitality and I honestly couldn't describe it any other way. So I decided to second that in my review title and description.  We work for a translation company and we are all globe trotters so we are used to travelling A LOT, and going on many executive meetings around the world. I speak for all my colleagues when I say that we have all never had an experience like we had at Hotel 41! It is one to remember and a 5 star review is the least we could do!  What is very impressive, is how every member of staff across the hotel, restaurants and bars are all trained to the same level of impeccable service. It's so‚Ä¶"
October 2020,Birthday Stay,"Stayed for one night at Hotel 41 for my Birthday.  We were upgraded to a Junior Suite and welcomed with Champagne on arrival.  The service was immaculate and the staff were excellent and friendly, making my birthday very special."
September 2020,Mini moon stay,My husband and I got married Last weekend and spent our mini moon in this amazing hotel. The staff were helpful and kind and the hotel beautiful. We could not fault anything and felt like royalty staying here. I could not recommend more. If you want to stay somewhere stunning with top notch service and in a fantastic location then this is the place. Thank you hotel 41 for making our weekend unforgettable.
September 2020,5***** service and beyond!,"Stayed 4 lovely nights at Hotel 41 in an exec twin room.  From the moment we arrived, and were welcomed with champagne and snacks, to the time we left I felt nothing was too much trouble for the staff.  Want your breakfast teapot and cup warmed?  You only have to mention it once and it's all done like magic every morning thereafter.  And not once did we have to give our room number when ordering drinks.  They just know!   It's not pretentious, it's not stuffy - it feels very welcoming whoever you are.  Would love to return - trying to persuade him indoors that Xmas would be fab!!"
August 2020,Wonderful luxury in the middle of a fairly miserable 2020,"As soon as travel restrictions were lifted we knew this was where we wanted to be, our favourite city centre hotel. Things have obviously changed a bit - you need to wear masks in the hall, the ""plunder the pantry"" buffet is now table service - but it is still a little oasis in the midst of the busy city, even more so now with the fantastic new rooftop terrace.  Immaculate service as always - I have no idea how they always know our names and rooms but there was no need to show a credit card or key for our entire stay - we asked for whatever we wanted, it was promptly delivered and seamlessly turned up on the bill when we left.   We had such a perfect weekend we came back a few weeks later for another weekend."
September 2020,I cannot tell you enough how much I LOVE this hotel!,"If you‚Äôre looking for a great location, wonderful service and a beautiful hotel, stay here. Honestly I am blown away with how amazing the staff is here. I will definitely be coming back. The rooms are so comfortable and the lounge is stunning. We absolutely love it here."
September 2020,Service beyond the imagination,"Stayed as a 60th birthday gift. Didn‚Äôt know what to expect but service started before we went in the building, greeted by wonderful gentleman who Knew our name and got our bag and car parked. To a lady who took us to the lift. Up to 5th floor to be greeted by name and sat and served champagne and nibbles while they checked us in and told us the process of getting food and drink and breakfast in the morning. They took us to our room and said they upgraded us to a suite. I was overwhelmed,. A mini cake, chocolates and massive room. I was choked up. Every time we went to the lounge I felt like a princess. The service was the same for everyone. The staff here work tirelessly, we saw a number of people enter the lounge at once. They worked fast to ensure we were well looked after and‚Ä¶"
August 2020,Amazing,"What a fabulous place to stay, easy to get to, fabulous staff, amazing food and everything else you would want for a stay in London. The staff go all out to make sure you have everything you would like, anytime and nothing is too much trouble. Would recommend this experience to everyone. Ive already booked the next visit. Thank you to everyone at the hotel who made our stay very very special."
August 2020,Excellent hotel,We have just spent a couple of nights at Hotel 41 for a birthday celebration. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Staff extremely helpful and attentive. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and location of the hotel. We would definitely recommend and hope to return: it‚Äôs an excellent hotel.
August 2020,Another great stay.,"Second time at Hotel 41. Again, first class all the way. Thank you to all the staff, from cocktails to turn down, we loved it all.  The Covid arrangements were fine for us. Didn‚Äôt spoil our stay at all.  We will be back."
August 2020,5* for a reason - amazing stay!,"I stayed here last weekend as a weekend break. From the moment I arrived and the lovely woman at the reception knew exactly who I was before I spoke, I knew I would be in for a treat. The service is absolutely incredible, every single person is made to feel welcome and special.   I was taken in to wait in the Executive Lounge, which is an elegant room.  I was given the choice to have a complimentary glass of champagne or a soft drink. The executive lounge is also where the complimentary food is provided; this includes an array of snacks, a variety of different flavours of ice cream and a menu of food to order! The complimentary food is available from 8 pm - 1am (which is perfect for the midnight munchies!).   My room was spotless and the bed was incredibly comfortable! COVID‚Ä¶"
August 2020,Luxury Hotel,"Hotel 41 is a luxury hotel on the doorstep of Buckingham Palace. The staff are extremely attentive and do everything they can to make you welcome and ensure your stay is enjoyable. The rooms are very clean, comfortable and have all the luxurious finishing touches you would expect. Drinks are reasonably priced and treats offered during the day are delightful, the croque monsiuer is superb and the breakfast is the best I have ever had. I highly recommend Hotel 41 and can‚Äôt praise the staff that made our stay so enjoyable highly enough, a wonderful experience!"
August 2020,Fantastic Hotel and Service,"We stayed here for 1 night and we had royal afternoon tea included which was wonderful, the staff even opened up The Rubens tea room for us to sit opposite the Royal Mews. The staff were so lovely and friendly and we also ate in BBar next door which was great too. We would love to come back and stay again soon"
October 2019,41,The epitome of taste. Classy yet friendly. Pricey but well worth the tariff. Curry room is quiet the best Indian in London. Bar Guy went out of his way to make (mock) cocktails when I let slip I was a professional teetotaler.
August 2020,Amazing ,"We stayed here last weekend for our wedding anniversary. We wanted a change of scenery and a small hotel ideally. The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. We were treated like royalty, well we were on Buckingham Palace Road!!! We decided to drive, we normally use the train and tube when staying in London but used the hotels valet parking for ¬£55 (24hrs). We were greeted at the door, bags out, simple as that... well worth the money.  We were kindly upgraded to a junior suite, located next door to the executive lounge/reception area, our room was fantastic as is the lounge area. We had a glass each of complimentary Lanson champagne upon arrival which is also a very nice touch.  There‚Äôs ice cream, sweets and chocolate along with more savoury produce in the evenings to‚Ä¶"
July 2020,"Perfect Birthday Celebrations, Thank You.","We visited  Hotel 41 for the first time on the 4th July 2020 for my Birthday, It was the day of opening up after Lock down and we were chuffed to be greeted with a Wonderful glass of champagne and Superb staff who made us feel at ease. We were upgraded to a Suite which was absolutely wonderful. Afternoon Tea was the best as was breakfast and we had dinner in the restaurant next door to the hotel which was also fantastic, this organised by the hotel for us as we wasn't sure what was available in the area. Cannot recommend enough, Wonderful staff, Lovely quiet relaxing rooms and lovely location.  We look forward to seeing you next year for our Wedding Anniversary."
August 2020,Simply the Best,"We have stayed at The Rubens on a number of occasions but have always wanted to experience Hotel 41 and we was lucky enough to do so this month as The Rubens closed due to low visitor numbers.  This truly was an amazing treat and words would never do this hotel justice.  We was welcomed by the most courteous staff who swiftly brought out a champagne trolley for us to enjoy a glass from, which clearly was a sign of things to come.  We was booked in for afternoon tea as part of our package which was as exquisite as ever. The whole experience was out of this world with the most scrumptious sandwiches and treats. All served on a truly royal stand   On checking in to our room we was upgraded to the Balmoral Suite which is like a room that we have never experienced before. The size‚Ä¶"
August 2020,Believe the hype!,"We stayed at Hotel 41 as a birthday get away, we were blown away by the reviews and had to try for ourselves.  From the second we arrived to the second we left we were treated to the most excellent, friendly customer service. The team at the hotel could not do enough for their guests and make you feel very welcome, very comfortable and very special. Their attention to detail and desire to tailor everyone‚Äôs experience is something I have never seen in any other hotel. An example was my wife being asked if she had enjoyed her birthday by a member of the team as we left when we‚Äôd not met that lady during our stay at any point, it was just the culture of the who team to treat everyone individually.  The room was well equipped and extremely comfortable with all the extras you‚Äôd‚Ä¶"
August 2020,An incredible example of customer service,"Our stay at hotel 41 was an incredible experience from start to finish. The staff are very attentive, without being overbearing and catered for our every need and want. It is always lovely to be greeted with a champagne welcome and we were thoroughly spoilt throughout our stay. The accommodation is beautiful, the food superb and the choice of quality drinks is also a great bonus. I'm not usually a review leaver but this place absolutely deserves a little something back. We are both key workers and were ready for some rest and relaxation, and that's exactly what we got. Thankyou, we will be back."
August 2020,Superb Relaxing Weekend At Wonderful Hotel,"Wanted to take my partner away for a nice weekend break post-lockdown, and couldn't have chosen a better place. From the warm welcome, with the lovely touch of  a glass of champagne, to the friendly, helpful staff, to the excellent room and the charming executive lounge area (with mouthwatering canapes and treats), everything about the weekend was first rate. Couldn't find a single fault even if I try really hard. Would recommend to anyone! Can't wait to book again later in the year!"
August 2020,A big birthday to treasure.....,"Originally we had booked to spend my 50th birthday in New York..... COVID put paid to that and when booked into the Egerton and subsequently moved to 41, I was firmly thinking 'Woe is me'.............. I could not have been more wrong!  From the stress free valet parking as we arrived and onward; the hotel is a little oasis of calm and elegance - reminiscent of the understated opulence of a library in My Fair Lady - the decor is just sumptuous and stunning. The food is very tasty and plundering the pantry is a definite must! even the experience of checking in was the most pleasurable I've ever known (whilst sipping a glass of complementary pink fizz).   What made it really outstanding though, is that - despite the potential for somewhere so glamorous to make for discomfort - it‚Ä¶"
August 2020,Mother and daughter weekend away,"The hotel is the best hotel I‚Äôve stayed in, in London. Really welcoming and attentive staff, great personal service, beautiful decor, fantastic and very comfortable bed. The roof top terrace with cocktails is a ‚Äòmust‚Äô. There is absolutely nothing I could offer to improve our experience from start to finish. Well done to all the staff involved in making our stay such a wonderful experience. "
August 2020,"Fabulous hotel, generous hospitality which far surpassed our exceptions","We were transferred to this hotel when the Milestone (sister hotel) had to postpone its opening. We stay at the Milestone because it's located near to family. It has reviews similar to Hotel 41, but we've never really been 'wowed' by the Milestone, so we entered Hotel with fairly modest expectations.  I very rarely write gushing reviews but Hotel 41 knocked our socks off!  We received a very warm welcome from the doorman and were met at the elevator by friendly reception staff. From there we were served complimentary welcome drinks in the beautiful lounge where the check in process was seamless.  The upgraded room was extremely well appointed, very clean, it had plenty of towels and toiletries. We didn't get a turn down service because I think the hotel was at full capacity, but‚Ä¶"
August 2020,Birthday celebration that I will always treasure,"Myself and my mum stayed at hotel 41 for my birthday celebrations. We couldn‚Äôt have been more blown away by the standards of service we received whilst staying there. They provide you with so many extra touches to make the experience of staying there very special, which does not compare to any other hotel we have stayed in. From the measures put in place that ensured we felt safe due to covid restrictions to meeting all of my dietary requirements with the little treats which added to the experience. We could not recommend this hotel high enough and no longer want to stay anywhere else when we visit London. Thank you so much to all at hotel 41 for making my birthday so magical!"
August 2020,Amazing Place,"Where do I start, well from the time I arrived. The bell man was there as soon as my cab pulled up, he was ready and waiting to greet me and my partner.   The excutive lounge was beautiful, made me feel like a princess in a castle. The staff on a whole where very friendly and  helpful and alsways had a smile and a hello when they saw you. The room was amazing with the black and white decor, the bed was so big and comfy. The breakfast well this was on point, very nice and served with a smile.   The rooftop garden is a must if your there in the summer.   The plsce makes you feel very special within its enviroment and the staff make you that much more extra special.   Fabulous place to stay in London,  41 Hotel will always have a place in my heart and my 1st choice of somewhere to‚Ä¶"
August 2020,Mother and Daughter Shopping Trip,"WOW, this hotel is incredible, if I could give it 10 stars I would.  The staff are amazing from Trisha in reservations and Adele on Reception, everyone was so helpful. The service and attention detail cannot be faulted. The room we had was absolutely stunning and the location is perfect. We shopped till we dropped and the beds are very comfortable and the hotel is lovely and quiet.  The rooftop bar is lovely and the snacking station was very welcoming. Very organised for Covid, we felt very safe and will definitely be back."
August 2020,Mr Smith,"Stayed at Hotel 41 and forgot we were in London, Best hotel staff we have encountered, our room was emaculate and the Executive Lounge and roof bar was the icing on the üéÇ the whole building has character and a special feeling.  Definitely coming back!! ‚ò∫"
August 2020,"nice exclusive hotel, hidden gem with great service",We normally visit Rubens but as it is closed we thought we would try 41. The staff are excellent and very accommodating. The setup is slightly different to most hotels with the reception also being an exec lounge with complementary snacks. We hope to visit again in a few weeks time.
August 2020,Fianc√©‚Äôs 50th Birthday,"This hotel was amazing! Everything about it was perfect. It was comfortable, cosy, classy and luxurious all at the same time. The staff were wonderful and ensured that our stay was a survival one! Special thanks to John (Head Concierge), Steve who served us lovely drinks in the bar, Dean who looked after us on the rooftop and Orci for making us feel at home. Also, the turndown service was impeccable, so special thanks to Adele and housekeeping for not only keeping our room lovely and clean and tidy, but for all the little finishing touches, such as a mini Birthday cake, chocolates, red petals, lip balms, little cord ties for our electrical items and many other little personal touches.   We were sad to leave you‚Äôd beautiful hotel and return to normality. We shall definitely be‚Ä¶"
August 2020,An amazing staycation in the heart of London,We snuck away to Hotel 41 for an overnight in London during a heatwave. The hotel was tucked away in plain site - it was extremely quiet and yet right next to Buckingham palace and near many of the great nearby attractions. It was very luxurious and easily one of our top hotels anywhere we have stayed. The small complimentary touches and gifts given throughout the stay were wonderful little surprises. The service was second to none. Highly recommend for those traveling to London for vacation or those within London looking to get away from their routine for a night or two.
August 2020,Birthday,"The most beautiful hotel i have ever stayed in, all of the staff are a credit to the hotel, friendly, kind and extremely helpful, will definitely be going back next year !! The executive lounge was perfect at the end of a long day"
February 2020,FABULOUS in every way ,"There really is nothing negative to say about this establishment. I‚Äôve stayed at other Red Carnation Hotels and they are all wonderful and this one is just the cherry on the cake. Privacy, quiet, exclusive, beyond comfortable and the staff is thoughtful in ways you wouldn‚Äôt ever imagine. Alex Tollman was instrumental in ensuring our stay exceeded all of our possible expectations and I will definitely reach out to her anytime I stay in London. Also, the 24 hour honesty bar, snacks and food are great! The location cannot be beat. "
July 2020,A bit of perspective....,"We had a very pleasant stay here- but I really can't fathom the gushing reviews.  The rooms are small (even the suites are small); they are well appointed but they are not spacious.  Staff perfectly nice, but exactly as one would expect from a hotel.  There are no facilities other than the communal lounge ie no pool, spa etc.  Small roof terrace with restricted views.  Location wise it's off the main drag for hotels (ie if you are visiting London, the areas around Picadilly Circus etc are more central) but this is nice for access to St James's Park, which is one of the best parks in London in my opinion.  Overall, it's perfectly nice but really not the great fanfare that other visitors have written- I can only wonder how well travelled some of them are!"
July 2020,"Superb stay, beautiful hotel"," We had the most perfect stay, from the moment we drove up to have our car valet parked to the welcome we received. We loved having some time up on the roof terrace and enjoying the moment.¬† Every member of staff went above and beyond any expectation we had.¬† We also felt very safe after lockdown as the hotel has taken every measure with hand sanitisers, distancing and masks., nothing was too much trouble.¬† It was my husband‚Äôs 60th¬†and you had gone to the trouble of upgrading us to a suite which was a lovely ¬†and such a beautiful room. The loved the breakfast room and yet again the service was superb and delicious selection. We will definitely recommend the hotel and will be back. Their attention to detail was exceptional. Thank you. "
July 2020,Excellent from the second we stepped through the door.,"Hotel 41 far exceeded our expectations. We had seen the reviews and booked a single night there for a birthday getaway. From the moment we walked in the door there was a sense of calm and friendliness all around.   The check-in was wonderful with a brief chat and some champagne and nibbles. The room was lovely and the roof terrace a great place to enjoy a quick glass and some aperitifs.  The world's best cup of tea welcomed us back after a nice meal out in Knightsbridge.  We would love to revisit Hotel 41 again, after a single night it felt like we were saying au-revoir to some good friends."
July 2020,Anniversary Break,"We cannot fault this wonderful hotel and staff. We previously stayed in the Red Carnations‚Äô Milestone and it was fab, but 41 exceeded our expectations, and more.   Expensive, yes but value for money? And more!   We felt very well looked after, some personable touches including a celebratory slice of cake and chocolates.  Steve and Lauren were wonderful hosts, also another worker (we missed his name) was also very hospitable!   We spent the entire weekend in the hotel bar drinking, we never felt the need to go elsewhere for a much over-due break from the hustle of life!   Thanks to all and we will be back again soon!   Scott and Stephanie Jarvie"
July 2020,1 night stay for our engagement,I was speaking to the hotel weeks if not months in advance to try and plan everything so I could propose to my girlfriend of 8 years. I had high expectations after seeing other reviews but am happy to say they where all exceeded by a country mile.  The hotel its self was luxurious clean and beautifully laid out. The staff where what made it for us they where so attentive friendly and welcoming. we where lucky enough to be upgraded to the balmoral suite that was amazing.  We got engaged on the roof terrace and celebrated with complementary Champaign.  We are both already exited to plan our next stay.  Could not fault anything and looking forward to
July 2020,Luxurious central London sanctuary,We enjoyed a superb stay at Hotel 41 this weekend to celebrate my husband‚Äôs birthday. From start to finish staff did their utmost to offer friendly but professional service. Doors open magically with staff anticipating your next move. Hotel 41 benefits from a glorious roof top bar with spectacular views across London and the executive lounge offers a huge array of complimentary treats and a wonderful champagne trolley.  The location is perfect as there is so much within walking distance there is no need to worry about cabs or the underground at the moment.  With just 33 rooms and not open to non-residents the hotel has the feel of a private members club but without being stuffy.  Highly recommended if you are looking for a special and intimate hotel in central London for a post‚Ä¶
July 2020,A real discovery,Got transferred from the Milestone to Hotel 41 - what a pleasant surprise! Friendly staff with excellent suggestions for things to do and places to go. The room was perfect (got a free upgrade to their junior suite) and the rooftop bar is amazing. Snacks available throughout the day (ice cream as well:) and the best vodka martini I ever had. 10 out of 10 would recommend.
May 2019,Probably the best boutique hotel in London ," The hotel's English butler service is phenomenal. The room is a historic British style. The Executive Lounge offers all-day food and beverages in addition to breakfast. In addition to the charge, the wine is free, and a delicious hot dish is served during dinner. It‚Äôs a bit pricey, but definitely worth the money. "
May 2019,Treasured Memories at Hotel 41,"Unfortunately, the virus forced us to miss another special stay at 41 as we planned for early May 2020. 41 is truly is a home away from home. The people, the service, the ambiance, the special touches and treatments, the list goes on and on.   On our first visit, our honeymoon, we were offered the two level Conservatory suite and all the amazing extras that come along with the suite (including a glass ceiling to watch the stars at night). Champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, red roses, and romantic bubbles all truly delighted the senses.  We have been back many times since, but never managed to stay in such an elaborate and spectacular suite, but fingers crossed it will be available on one of our future visits. Since it is a very small boutique hotel, booking in advance is‚Ä¶"
February 2020,Your own personal palace.,"If you want to go somewhere special and really be looked after, there's nowhere better to go. It's like staying in your own personal palace full of lovely staff. Nothing is too much trouble and it's a little secret so great we don't really want to tell you about it."
March 2020,Excellent service in difficult times,"I have had to cancel my UK trip and stay at Hotel 41 due to the coronavirus and the travel advisory from the Canadian government. I had already prepaid a non-refundable fare for four nights through Expedia. I must command the utmost professionalism of the team at the hotel during this difficult time. Due to the rapidly evolving situation, there was some confusion and misunderstanding (I didn‚Äôt realize I was eligible for cancellation insurance until the government officially advised against travel, etc), and truth be told I was feeling quite stressed having to handle all the cancellations for the trip. They were amazingly patient and helped me with what I needed without having to go back to Expedia again. I imagine this is an incredibly difficult time for the hotel and the staff‚Ä¶"
March 2020,Remembering the best of times,"One of my fail proof strategies for a pick-me-up is to daydream about the wonderful experiences I have been fortunate to have.  Like most people around the world I have had to change my plans - perspective and reality check.  I should have been packing for myself and my son to travel to the UK for a very very special birthday party (think 50yrs of life, 18months of planning), instead I am preparing to be on the medical front line in Australia.  So I am daydreaming about where I would have been instead. About now I would be burning up the last of my adrenaline after our 26 hour commute and about to have the doors opened for me at Hotel 41, where we would have been greeted with helping hands, warm smiles and open hearts.  The foyer would have smells of fresh bread and coffee, a‚Ä¶"
March 2020,Perhaps my favorite hotel yet,"This is absolutely one of the finest hotel experiences we have ever had and we have had some fabulous experiences.  The staff goes above and beyond to exceed all expectations.  Our room was lovely with all the appointments with one could need.  It would be difficult to name one staff member as every single staff member was beyond warm and helpful.  they made me coffee at 3 AM and helped us rearrange our travel when the coronavirus created havoc on a global level. They made a cozy fire in our room and brought a toasty hot water bottle that my daughter clung to in this uncertain time.  Sadly, we had to cut our trip short but the staff listened to our woes, made my daughter hot cocoa while Mommy was on the phone for hours trying to get us out of the country, and rearranged dinner‚Ä¶"
March 2020,Superb Service,Had a fabulous stay in hotel 41. It is a small boutique hotel in a wonderful location. From the moment we arrived we were made feel so welcome by every staff member. The service from everyone was superb nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was delicious and all the nibbles supplied all day was a wonderful treat. Highly recommend and we will definitely be back!
March 2020,Best hotel in London,I‚Äôve stayed in many hotels in my time but none were as special as 41. From the moment we arrived we were well cared for. Everyone was really pleasant and all went the extra mile. A gem of a hotel in a mediocre world
March 2020,Exemplary hotel experience,"All aspects of the Hotel 41 experience were beyond our expectations.   The staff is warm, accommodating and skilled.  Every possible contingency was  attended to and anticipated beforehand.  Rooms are beautifully decorated, impeccably clean and perfectly appointed.  The room's  fireplace added a special warmth to the setting.   In house dining with delicious breakfasts, wonderful snacks, and fabulous evening buffet complimented the hotel experience.  This hotel should be on anyone's list if service, luxury and location are priorities.  Looking forward to a return visit in the near future.  Thanks to all.    Best regards, S."
February 2020,Best hotel in London,"A wonderful hotel with big rooms, but feels like a home. The staff is amazing, extremely services minded and friendly. They did little things, like preparing your room for night by lightning some (fake) candles and putting on relaxing music, even giving you a weather prognosis for the next day."
February 2020,A magical stay !,"We read a lot of reviews about the 41 before booking a room. A lot of them were pretty nice. We were scared by a few ones which were saying it was a not so perfect experience and kind a waste of money. Being a long time faithful guests of red carnation properties, we trusted our guts and we tried it anyway. Let us just say this: the 41 is incredible and will fullfil all your expectations and beyond.  The staff was helpful without being intrusive. Always with a smile, they are quickly catching on all your needs and habits, even after only one day. The lounge was truly wonderful, classy chic, cozy, with delicious food (canap√©s to die for, a different buffet every day, with a high level of quality and savoir-faire. The label tags were missing one day, but you got to have the‚Ä¶"
February 2020,Just outstanding!,"A life spent in hotels has allowed me to define the perfect hotel = and 41 is it. From the moment we arrived the personal attention to detail started - and even learnt and used our names - Wow! The standard of service, the amazing staff, the food and drinks in the lounge and a really comfortable bed and quiet room. This hotel defines what a 5 star hotel should be and how it is done. You must try it and see for yourself, and its in a great location and very well served by Victoria for the Tube."
February 2020,Superb! 100% Perfect ,"So I was looking for a supremely comfortable hotel in central London following the change of The Arch - my long term favourite - to another style after a huge refurb. I came across this hotel on Trip Advisor and it seemed to be consistently number 1 in London   Surely not? Oh yes!   Everything about this hotel is completely perfect - the location, the comfort level of the rooms, the staff, the complimentary food in the Executive lounge, the hot water bottle you find in your bed at night, (with lavender pillow spray) the candlelit bathroom on your return at night the luxury toiletries and the superbly comfortable beds.   It is  supremely comfortable without being ‚Äòover the top.‚Äô Every single member of staff is a credit to the hotel, Having found Hotel 41 - that‚Äôs it - I won‚Äôt be‚Ä¶"
February 2020,Luxury = Hotel 41,"We have stayed at Hotel 41 on numerous occasions and like with our previous stays, the hotel did not disappoint.  For us, when in London our address will always be 41 Buckingham Palace Road @ Hotel 41.  The level of service of the staff along with the their personal touch is second to none.  The staff in the executive lounge are there to pamper you and provide for your every need, and they did not disappoint.  The food is exceptional, the accommodations are first class and the service is second to none.   What else could you possibly ask for?  My wife and I already cannot wait until our next stay."
February 2020,Luxurious Oasis in London ,We were delighted to return to Hotel41 for our annual February stay and enjoy once again this amazing oasis in the heart of London . From the moment you walk through the door you feel calm and relaxed as Malcolm and his fantastic staff make you feel so welcome and do everything possible to ensure you have a marvellous stay ! We were extremely fortunate to be upgraded to a suite which we so appreciated and it just put the icing on the cake as it were ! I won‚Äôt go into details of what great service is available as it‚Äôs well documented in other reviews but just like to say if you are ever in London and want to have a unique luxury hotel experience look no further than Hotel 41 its the best !! Thank you everyone for making our stay so memorable and we are looking forward to next‚Ä¶
February 2020,I am in love with this hotel,"I booked two rooms in this hotel.  One for my husband and I, and another for my daughter coming in from Ireland.  This hotel has to be one of my favourites.  From the outset, the reception and staff are excellent.  At check in, you are greeted with champagne and the process is seamless.  In the executive lounge, there are always drinks and snacks available.  The room is cozy.  Lots of outlets and the bathroom appears small, but there is plenty of room for storage of your toiletries.  Turn-down service is heavenly.  A hot water bottle is placed in your bed every evening.  I cannot say enough good things about this hotel.  I have stayed at Waldorfs, Fairmonts, St. Regis, Belmonds, etc., but this is one of my preferred hotels."
November 2019,Outstanding and exceptional Property!!!,The food is amazing both at breakfast and in the evening at both of their restaurants. From the first salute of the security guards to the excellent service by the pool This is an amazing hotel I have ever stay.
February 2020,Best in London? ,"Now I have not stayed in every hotel in London, so I can't definitively say that Hotel 41 is the best in London. But what I can say is when it comes to personal service, attention to detail and the feeling of exclusivity I can't see how any other hotel could possibly do it better. I won't go. Into every detail of my stay. Just know that if you are thinking of booking but worry that it couldn't possibly live up to the hype and all the glowing reviews you have read, trust me it will live up to and exceed your expectations. Couldn't have had a nicer stay. "
January 2020,Another visit to 41 and just as fantastic as usual!,"The hotel is not big which is perfect.  The service is fantastic with lovely staff, always attentive, friendly and prepared to do the utmost to make you feel welcome and important.  The room is elegant, contains all that you need and a little bit more.  The hotel is situated close to Buckingham Palace, ie very central. And finally an amazing and generous breakfast! /Emilie"
January 2020,Remains special!,"Once again, we enjoyed our stay at 41 really much. This time we went to London as a gift for my sons' graduation. When we arrived in the room there was a surprise cake for him. That was amazing!! Apart from that the hotel was perfect in all aspects and the staff was wonderful!"
December 2019,New year escape,"Another fabulous stay at the 41 right from check in all the staff make your stay just so comfortable anything you need they will get it for you, plunder the pantry in the evenings is great the breakfasts are amazing the hotel is warm and cosy will be back soon"
October 2019,My new favorite hotel in London,"I fell in love with this boutique hotel! I came with my son Hugo for Halloween and the whole team was ever so friendly with us! The room we had was cosy, with a fireplace that was lit every evening: what √† delight! My son was thrilled to find chocolates and Halloween goodies in the room: thanks again! We enjoyed playing games in the evening in the main room by the fireplace while enjoying snacks from the buffet. The hotel is perfectly located right next to th√© royal mews / Buckingham and St James Park. We will definitely come back soon! Thanks again for a great stay!"
December 2019,Amazing as always,"Another amazing stay, thanks to all the team who work so hard to ensure you have a great time. Really nothing is to much trouble. Stayed for 4 nights over New Year and everything was perfect, shame to leave and come back to reality."
December 2019,Classic Elegance,"We stayed here for 5 nights in December.  If you want to feel like you are a guest at someone's private estate, this is the place for you.  Their hospitality surpasses any 5-star hotel we've visited.  Their friendliness and concern for any need you may have is truly genuine."
December 2019,A hotel that goes above and beyond ,Always a joy to return to Hotel 41. The staff are fantastic and the attention to detail above and beyond. A stressful stay for me due to some business requirements and a special thanks to Marlen who was incredibly helpful.  Thank you guys... wouldn‚Äôt dream of staying anywhere else when we visit London.
December 2019,Home from home,"We‚Äôve had two recent trips to 41 and the first of these reminded me why we love this hotel so much.  There really is nowhere else quite like it. The real key is the service level. Staff take care to know you by name and understand and note carefully your habits and needs.   For me it represents excellent value for money. This does not mean it is cheap but it does mean that we get a service which reflects what we‚Äôve paid.  The ‚Äòplunder the pantry‚Äô is, as far as I know, unique and is, quite simply, superb for an inveterate ‚Äòsnacker‚Äô such as myself. It‚Äôs what I would do at home!   The executive lounge is a great place to relax and take a drink, and is a welcome break from the frenetic pace of London. The drinks prices are no different from any other London location but the ambience‚Ä¶"
December 2019,Perfect for Birthday night out in London,"What a gem. Booked for a nice place to stay as part of a birthday night out. Lovely hotel - great rooms, decor, bar lounge area beautiful and relaxing, service exceptional. With all the bars and restaurants nearby there are lots of options - will have to come again to try bbar which was closed on Sunday. Central to tourist sites if that‚Äôs what you want - Westminster, Buckingham Palace, parks and so on, but also perfect for a relaxing place to stay as part of a good night out. Loved it, will stay again. "
December 2019,As wonderful as always,"Another pre Christmas stay at 41 and again it was wonderful.  This hotel is magnificent, greeted as warmly as ever, champagne by the fire and a cozy and comfortable room.  The honesty bar was stocked as well as usual.  We‚Äôll be back next year and already can‚Äôt wait."
January 2020,The BEST in London,"Stellar service and amenities. Every time we had a ‚Äúwow‚Äù moment and thought it couldn‚Äôt get any better, they surprised us with even more amazing things. We didn‚Äôt want for anything. I‚Äôve stayed in many London hotels, and this is the zenith! Can‚Äôt wait to come back."
January 2020,Just as everyone says,"The quality and amenities were every bit as good as advertised and reviewed. We have stayed at their sister hotel, Rubens, just about every year for there last few and love that. We decided to stay at the 41 for a special occasion. We used it as out ""home."" We have been out to dinner many times in London and don't eat a lot at dinner, so we just stayed there for the things they put out in the evening and had drinks. We feel like we got to know their friendly staff, and that made it even more comfortable each evening.  Since we didn't go out, we declined the turndown service except for one night. Should have got it every night because that was the BEST. Allow it to be done... The only negative, and this is personal to us, is how much they want to help. We don't need much‚Ä¶"
January 2020,"Hidden Gem, Outstanding service","Outstanding service from the moment you make a reservation to when you walk in the door staff make you feel welcome and try accommodate your every need.  It's a smallish hotel (40 rooms) and no real signage on the exterior.  They keep a receptionist in the lobby to direct you to the upper floors where rooms are and check in occurs.  There is an executive suite available for guests to access a light breakfast, quick snacks and water, coffee or tea during the day (tea and small canapes are offered early evening as well), drinks and other food are available as well.  Rooms are tastefully decorated in black and whites with all the amenities you would come to expect in any hotel.  They are good sized and comfortable.  Wake up calls are personally done with a knock on the door and‚Ä¶"
January 2020,We just love this place!,"Hotel 41 has fortunately become our home away from home. We love their philosophy of service and the attention to detail. Even the smell of the hotel is great!!! The staff are so friendly helpful and attentive. The evening pantry is fab, although never really needed....it has to be done! Best place to stay in London  "
January 2020,Absolutely fantastic,"Incredible hotel with amazing staff. This was our third visit and the standard is higher than ever. The staff are quite exceptional, the care and attention we received makes other hotels look poor. We arrived for my wife‚Äôs birthday and we had a cake in the room which had been upgraded to a suite! We had a lunch in b bar which is part of the Rubin‚Äôs and again exemplary service. We‚Äôre already considering staying in the summer and will defiantly return next January."
February 2019,Impeccable Service!,"Actually stayed her on our first trip to London in 2017 and we loved it. It was a Last minute trip, so we booked our room as we boarded the plane. Hotel 41 held our room without even taking a credit card to hold it, staff was soooo nice. Close to buckingham palace and some good restaurants. "
January 2020,Fantastic,Definitely the best hotel I have ever stayed in. Once again our stay surpassed our expectations.  The hotel is amazing. It's like a tranquil oasis in the middle of london. It's so nice we ended up spending most of the day relaxing in the beautiful lounge. Thanks so much to all the staff for making my husbands birthday extra special. We just can't wait to come back.
January 2020,Impressive hotel and extraordinary service!,This hotel I would love to give 10 stars!! They have superb in hospitality!! We stayed in many hotel but I would give hotel41 the best of the hotel !!many five star hotel should have learn this kind of hospitality but many place still act like robots  We stayed for 2 night accually I should decide to stay here the whole trip we were in UK anyway we will surely come back for the special room that have roof glass can see the stars that what the staff told us !! By the way we got upgraded to the room the have 2 stories ‚ô•Ô∏èüëç
January 2020,Customer service experience,"I am soon to be staying at Hotel 41.  Positive feedback online led me to call to make an enquiry which turned into a booking.  Reason for my review is that the customer service experience delivered by Kirsty, the hotel's Reservations Manager, was first class. Working in management myself, I know it can be an arduous role sometimes, but the phone call to make my booking was informative, swiftly handled and a smooth process.  Already excited to for my visit to this hotel.  Thank you Kirsty & Hotel 41!"
January 2020,Brilliant stay for our wedding anniversary,"Cannot leave a high enough review. What a gem of a hotel. Absolutely fabulously appointed small boutique hotel, wonderful staff so accommodating and friendly. We stayed overnight for our wedding anniversary and the staff and hotel spoilt us beyond any expectation, upgraded our room, special anniversary cake and congratulations but even had it not been our anniversary the staff were amazing and the room lovely. Perfectly situated to walk into LONDON. Will be recommending to my friends as know they will love it. Thank you hotel 41"
July 2019,Where everybody knows your name üé∂,The London Series! Could not have picked a more appropriate Hotel for a hospitable stay in London. The moment you enter - the greeting is amiable and professional. Followed by a personal check-in with champagne service. All very nice - but what is more impressive is the personal attention to detail that is afforded each guest by each member of the staff. This type of service encourages a friendly atmosphere that makes one want to revisit! So I am planning another trip with my husband so he can experience ‚Äúplunder the pantry ‚Äú at midnight! PS the location is fabulous.
November 2019,"Distinguished Service, Exceptional Accommodations and Historic Location","We made our yearly pilgrimage to London to celebrate our 30th anniversary and wanted an exceptional hotel. We have stayed with the Red Carnation family before and wanted to have a special experience for this trip so Hotel 41 was our choice. Hotel 41 exceeded our expectations. The location across from Royal Mews, Buckingham Palace and short walk to Victoria Tube and Train station was convenient to numerous historical and tourist spots as well as many dinning options. The breakfast at the hotel offered many options and the kitchen was very accommodating to our request. The afternoon scone and snack bar provide a quick pick me up and the English tea choice made for a nice afternoon break.  The room accommodation where truly 5 star. From the plush bedding, heated bath towels, fire‚Ä¶"
April 2019,Luxury and Location,"Room Quality: 4/5 Front Desk ( Check in & Check out Experience): 4/5  F&B including IRD : 2.5/5 Housekeeping of Hotel: 5/5 Vibe : Mixed Amenities:   Love the entrance to this hotel, very discreet. Really comfortable rooms with a lot of amenities of offer. What set them apart was their service, thoroughly consistent throughout our stay. Room for improvement in f&b though. Again very good location."
November 2019,Truly amazing experience,"We stayed at hotel 41 for an extended weekend and it is simply the best hotel I have ever stayed at. Their service, kindness and willingness to make our stay just perfect was top notch. I have never experienced anything like it. We will definitely be back again next year. Many thanks to the entire staff for a truly amazing experience."
November 2019,Very special! In a positive way... ,"Stayed here for a weekend. Kind of discreet entrance. You take the elevator to the fifth floor, where all rooms and a wonderfully traditional lounge, including reception desk, bar and snack buffet, are located. Very attentive and friendly staff everywhere. It feels like being at somebody‚Äôs home, in a very positive sense. We had a junior suite, mezzanine style, which we really liked. Traditional interiors with a quirky touch. Well equipped in all aspects. Impeccable service. Only reason for rating 4/5 and not 5/5, is that the price level is high, also with London standards... Guess we would stay here again though... "
November 2019,Weekend in London,"Because of extremely high ratings on TA my sister and I decided to stay in hotel 41 during a recent weekend in London. Location of the hotel is convenient, close to a tube station. First welcome was very pleasant, and introduction to the hotel facilities was informative completed with a glass of champane. A room was comfortable, with everything you can wish including a plate of frutes  and sweets. Breakfast had a great variety of hot choices but we missed fresh vegetables on cold meniu. Keeping in mind that it is a 5 star hotel, a glass of proseco or champane would be a must during a breakfast. I would not consider very professional to serve toast with eggs and pancakes by breakfast staff at the same time because a second dish became cold until I start eating it. Staff of tha‚Ä¶"
November 2019,The best,"We have traveled to many hotels and thought we had great service and amenities. But Hotel 41 has topped them all. The staff is considerate and helpful and welcoming, every. day. Not a day went by without them doing a multitude of things that made our stay even more perfect. They go 100% on anything and everything.  We cannot wait to return there. I wouldn‚Äôt consider staying at any other hotel in London."
November 2019,Great Hotel,Very special boutique hotel... terrific location for most activities.. staff couldn't be more helpful and welcoming... we stayed here a number of years ago and it was wonderful then and has not changed! Would highly recommend!
November 2019,Attention to detail ,"This hotel‚Äôs attention to detail is impeccable. On entering you are met by a lovely smell as well as a friendly person at the desk.  You‚Äôre introduced to the reception area & a welcoming glass of champagne.  Our room was beautiful! They have thought  of everything you may need (I won‚Äôt ruin your lovely surprise)  The bath & shower - could‚Äôve stayed in their for hours.  The bed - stunning & so comfy and were turned down (won‚Äôt ruin surprise number 2)  In the evening there‚Äôs delicious food available .... I only have one criticism & that is with the reception being on the 5th floor, this is where you eat. I felt I was imposing on people eating their breakfast and when it was our turn to eat, we felt we were being ‚Äòwatched‚Äô. Would I stay here again? Absolutely!   "
November 2019,WOW! This is just a fantastic and special hotel,"Firstly the location is ideal for London Eye, Westminster etc but as soon as you walk through the door you enter somewhere very unique and charming.  Staff so helpful and genuine, rooms the most comfortable we have every stayed in, and the fire burning blissfully away when you come in from the cold was very welcoming. The only hotel I have been in where a hot water bottle is put in the bed with his/her slippers by the side.The executive lounge offers a very fine choice of wine and spirits as well as beers and soft drinks.  The ambience of the room encourages you to just wind down and relax, horderves and snacks in abundance throughout the day and evening.  Breakfast menu offered something for everyone and you could even add your choice of what you wanted.  The standard of food,‚Ä¶"
October 2019,Simple amazing. Simple perfect. Amazing perfect hotel. Must see,"Not sure how I can express in words how amazing this hotel is in London. Of course I found it on Trip Advisor. And they have rarely steered me wrong. From the moment we walked in, we knew it would be magical. Greeted with a glass of champagne. Exceptional service. Amazing location. Simply perfect. They were on point from the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out. The person checking us in (forgot his name, young male) made us feel at home, took extensive time to explain London and where to go and even gave his own point of few. We have the privilege of staying in the Master Suite. If you can do that, do it! Two story suite with a glass roof. Perfect. Thank you for making this London experience unforgettable. "
October 2019,A hidden gem,"Hotel 41 was recommended by a very good friend Eddie and I can‚Äôt thank him enough.  We were greeted with smiles and excellent hospitality throughout our stay for our anniversary. On arrival glasses of rose champagne were offered and thankfully consumed. A delicious cake and sweets were awaiting along with a card from management. There are many good restaurants around too and when we returned back from a delicious Lebanese dinner nearby, the fireplace was on, nicely heating the room and a hot water bottle ready, making the homely feel even more enjoyable. The continental breakfast in the morning was delicious with lots of choices on offer. Staff in the lounge were always nearby ensuring that everything was impeccable.  This is a must stay hotel for couples looking for relaxed‚Ä¶"
September 2019,Sublime hospitality!,"I must admit that as far as a boutique hotel is concerned I don't think you can do much to improve this hotel.  The service from the time of check in is simply sublime from start to finish.     We were upgraded to a suite as a start and the value-add's just do not end, another dimension which makes it no surprise for their #1 rating on Trip Advisor.  From the executive lounge greeting with some bubbly, the whenever/whatever button in your room, the 24/7 treat room, to the handpicked list of whisky bars left in our room there is simply no end to the staff going the extra mile for guests.  The guest services team at the desks in the lounge are remarkable.  Truly at the top of the top when it comes to guest services and warm hospitality.   My only criticism would be the concierge‚Ä¶"
October 2019,"Fantastic stay, outstanding service!!","The reviews aren‚Äôt wrong, the service at Hotel 41 is outstanding. I stay in lots of very nice hotels throughout the year, all over the world and very rarely go out of my way to write a review. I couldn‚Äôt help myself with Hotel 41!  My wife and I checked in on Thursday and stayed until Sunday without the kids for a romantic, relaxing break.   The hotel is located near Buckingham palace which is close enough to most things.  Upon check in we were helped up to the executive lounge, you are greeted with a glass of fiz ( so nice we have order a crate full! )  The staff make this hotel so special, David did a great job of welcoming you, checking you in, showing you to your room and making you feel comfortable. The ‚Äòwhenever/whatever‚Äô button in your room does exactly what it says.....‚Ä¶"
October 2019,"Hotel is truly a gem, but the location may hinder us staying there again","Full disclosure - London is my favourite city in the world to visit, and I travel there a few times a year both on business and pleasure.  We decided to stay at Hotel 41 as I was intrigued by its high rating, and I have stayed in one of its ""sister hotels"" in Geneva which was spectacular.  Typically I stay at the Langham due to service, rooms and location.  The pros: - small hotel with personalized highly attentive service - seems to have high staff to guest ratio - for London, the guest rooms, including the bathrooms were generous in size - the room itself had great linens, etc. - we were always greeted with a warm smile; I find that in many luxury hotels in London the staff is more sterile, even if pleasant - in advance of your stay you are sent a form so that they know how to‚Ä¶"
October 2019,Hotel 41 is Amazing,We stayed at Hotel 41 in October 2019 in London and it was fantastic.  The rooms and Executive Lounge are beautiful. But the best thing about Hotel 41 is the wonderful employees - they made our stay fantastic.  We asked them at the last minute to see if they could locate a wheelchair for my mom on a Sunday morning.  Initially they had no luck since all the places were either already rented out or closed since it was Sunday.  But they kept trying and the called our room  about 15 minutes later saying they had located a wheelchair at one of their sister properties and they were going to have it sent over in a taxi! This made our stay in London that much more special. We will definitely stay at Hotel 41 on our next visit to London.
October 2019,Exquisite Hotel,"This is an excellent Boutique Hotel. From the moment I was checked in until I left, everyone tried their best to make my stay memorable. I truly enjoyed my stay at Hotel 41. Magdalena at the welcome desk was very helpful and friendly. A bubbly upon check in was a nice touch.  Will I come back, you bet!"
October 2019,Best Hotel in London,"We stay at Hotel 41 every time we visit London and it's clear why the instant we enter the hotel. The service is impeccable - from the champagne arrival to the personal touches on the turndown service to the fact that every staff member knows your name. On this trip we want to personally thank Steve Jones, Alex, Mitchell, and the Night Manager Vladis who helped make this stay as incredible as every other one we've had at the hotel."
August 2019,SIMPLY THE BEST!,"The title of my review speaks for itself - Hotel 41 is Simply the Best.  Of all the places we have stayed in the world Hotel 41 still rates as the best for service, beautifully appointed rooms, very friendly staff, fantastic breakfasts, plunder-the-pantry treats and overall such a wonderful place to stay.  This is our fifth stay with Hotel 41 and every time we arrive here it is like a haven to us.  The hotel is close to Victoria Station, Buckingham Palace, the Mall and overall it is such a great place to stay and be within walking distance of a lot of attractions in London.  We must thank Magdalena once again for her thoughtfulness & kindness - she is an asset to Hotel 41. It is the small things that make a difference like acknowledging special occasions that make Hotel 41 so‚Ä¶"
October 2019,Best Hotel Stave Ever!,"We arrived and were greeted downstairs warmly even though we were a bit early for check in.  Everyone was so attentive, it was better than any service we have had, and we have stayed at some very nice places.  I think the small size of the hotel adds to the ambiance and the staff was absolutely amazing! My wife had a bit of a cold and they offered cough sweets/drops and brought a humidifier to the room.  The best feature of the hotel is the button on your phone which reads, ""Whatever/Whenever"".  Meaning the staff are on call for you all the time.  Great stay!"
November 2019,We enjoyed a three night stay at the 41,"It is a unique botique hotel that has a great location accross from Buckingham Palace. It is within walking distance to many of the historical sites in London. The Hotel itself is very comfortable and we had a two level suite, sitting room below and bedroom above. Plenty of space for the two of us. 'There was an executive room for snacks and drinks. The staff was excellent and provided friendly and fast service. It was a great stay."
November 2019,Fantastic,As this hotel won best hotel in London we booked it for our anniversary as a treat.   But with such great reviews I had high expectations and I was not disappointed.  It is the best hotel we have ever stayed in.  Yes it‚Äôs a considered purchase but omg it‚Äôs worth it.  Small things like a hot water bottle in your bed make such an enjoyable stay.  We are looking to make this our annual anniversary celebration
November 2019,Exceptional!,"The service was simply exceptional.   Friendly, attentive, proactive, generous, warm, welcoming and with great attention to details. The executive lounge has an amazing vibe, warm yet luxurious, rich but not overwhelming, intimate though you still feel part of the scene. And the treats... they just keep flowing in. In 3 words - above and beyond!  The room is great. Filled with all the amenities one might want. Super comfortable bed and pillows, slippers, good A/C, sound proof, separate bath and shower, big and soft towels, robes, very dark when your turn off the lights, choice of morning papers, sweet treats, espresso machine and water (still and sparkling). Seriously, not much can be improved.  Well done."
November 2019,Anniversary ,"We stayed here for two nights on this occasion because one didn‚Äôt feel enough last time, on our next visit we hope to stay for three!  We can not recommend this hotel enough from the glorious decor to the wonderfully friendly, helpful and attentive team of professionals who work here to make your every moment as relaxing and enjoyable as humanly possible.  From the welcome glass of champagne at check in to the delicious complimentary range of food offered at various times of the day, Hotel 41 try to make you feel at home (if you lived in such a beautiful place!) and with all the effort put in by the fabulous team they certainly succeed! We couldn‚Äôt dream of living a real everyday life like this although I‚Äôm sure some of their guests are this lucky but the main reason it works so‚Ä¶"
November 2019,Birthday celebrations,"Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic - says it all. This hotel goes above and beyond. Cannot recommend this hotel enough for service, attention to detail, comfort and style. The hotel went out of its way to make our stay for birthday celebrations so special. A particular mention to Andrew & Steven for their attentiveness and enjoyable company. I particularly liked my hot water bottle in my bed when we arrived back from the theatre -little touches like these make this such a stand out hotel.  Thank you again everyone at hotel 41."
November 2019,"Super friendly , highly professional oasis in central London","This property is superbly situated near theatre and Buckingham palace and although is in the heart of the city is very calm and quiet. The staff are amazing , warm and friendly but impeccable service and great attention to detail.  Taking time to find out special requests like transportation , bar service to the room etc . Everything arrived on time and in good order and they were lovely touches to like and honesty bar snack buffet and even hot water bottle in your bed when you arrive back at the end of the night. All in all great service and would definitely stay here again if I was needing to stay in central London!"
November 2019,Amazing stay from start to finish,We have stayed in some amazing hotels all over the world. Not only is this hotel a beautiful find not to be missed with great food and complimentary snacks. I can honestly say this the customer service and overall standard of service in general for this hotel was the best I have ever experienced not only in 5 star hotels in the uk . (We usually stay in the savoy or the shard) But I would go as far as to say the best on a overall all international level. From the second we arrived to the second we left. We had 24/7 service of the highest standard from everyone we met. Special mention to Andrew who went above and beyond to make our stay extra special and his professionalism along with his people skills was one of the main reasons I am writing this review. I can not recommend this‚Ä¶
October 2019,Delightful,Staying at this hotel is like surrendering yourself to the ministrations of an attentive Nanny. You feel cosseted and cared for without being smothered. Just lovely. The staff are uniformly kind and intuitive and I can not recommend more highly
November 2019,The best home from home.,"Decided to break our ‚Äústay at the Savoy‚Äù tradition and try a new establishment ...  I‚Äôm not one who leaves reviews often, stayed at many five starts throughout the world...  this one deserves my comment.  From the friendly greeting to the hospitality from start to finish. The staff could not do enough.  We had the conservatory suite... beautiful duplex arrangement more than satisfied me.   The ‚Äúexecutive lounge‚Äù sat by the fire with tip top service and array of canap√©s, drinks and friendly conversation in the most beautifully ambience ...  Particular mention to Andrew, he was an amazing host and the most engaging conversationalist.  I know where I am staying from now on each time I am in town...   Can not recommend enough.   It is also worth a mention that I have unwittingly‚Ä¶"
October 2019,Narnia is Hiding in London,"Behind a door on Buckingham Palace Road is a hidden world of calm, sophisticated luxury. Part of me wants to tell you about it, and part of me would like it to remain a secret! Hotel 41 is as wonderful as everyone says it is: a place to hide away from the busy noise of the city; a place where the service is unparalleled; a place where nothing is too much trouble; a place to tell your friends about (especially friends who you think deserve to have a wonderful few days in a magical world tucked away behind a simple glass panelled door)."
April 2019,Incredible customer service,"This boutique luxury hotel is uniquely situated on the 5th floor of an older building across the street from Buckingham palace.  The staff welcomes guests with champagne at check-in.  We celebrated our 25th anniversary during our stay, and were surprised to find a cake in our room for the occasion.  The hotel recommendation of Rules restaurant for our anniversary dinner was perfect.  You can‚Äôt beat the personal service you receive at Hotel 41."
July 2019,Perfect place to stay in London,"We were fortunate to celebrate our 40th Anniversary at Hotel 41, and it was worthy of the occasion; from the nicely appointed room, to the attentive staff at every turn, and finally to the wonderful breakfasts, tea, and evening spreads, it is a hotel unmatched in our lifetimes. Especially enjoyed the interactions with Steve and Stefan, who made us feel like family and not guests. The hotel is located in a great part of London, with easy access to most of the city's attractions, but really, why would you want to leave? We will be back!"
July 2019,Simply Wonderful,"We wanted somewhere special for our wedding night, the photos and reviews were so good we treated ourselves for our special day, albeit booking a regular room. From the second we arrived, we were treated like royalty, from the doorman taking our bags, to the complimentary champagne when signing in and for every single moment during our stay, every single member of staff very politely greeted us by name. Arriving at our room we were told that they had upgraded our room to the Conservatory suite, which was beyond our wildest dreams, it was utterly perfect, down to every tiny detail.  We had dinner in the English grill (again with a complimentary bottle of champagne) which was delightful.   Finally returning to our room, to be greeted with scattered rose petals, candles, soft music‚Ä¶"
September 2018,If You Like Horses and Alice in Wonderland,"This private hotel is pricy but worth it.  When we first arrived,,, kind of strange, the lobby decor reminded me of Alice in Wonderland. Got lost several times trying to find our room, the hallways being narrow, color scheme, felt like a maze, hard to explain, but cool.  It's not your ordinary hotel, that's for sure but lots of amenities. The top floor restaurant with a big skylight is always open for free snacks and deserts. You must pay for meals and room service but the staff is terrific and goes the extra mile. We stayed in a couple of their rooms, very cozy and warm decor. If you can stay on the top floor, I'd advise that as you can hear the cleaning of the rooms and walking back and forth, building structure is old.  Now, to the horses. Right across the street is the Royal‚Ä¶"
July 2019,Wonderful stay at our new favorite hotel!,"Have to admit that we were a little skeptical about whether Hotel 41 could live up to all the great Trip Advisor reviews, but it so deserves them!  First of all, the service was absolutely outstanding- usually you might note one or two people that stand out, but in this case every single staff person we interacted with made us feel welcome and like valued guests. The hotel is small, only about 30 rooms, so it has the wonderful feel of an intimate, luxurious inn, but it has all the amenities of a full size luxury hotel (in part due to it connecting through a discrete door in the lobby to a sister larger hotel property-The Rubens at the Palace-next door). In terms of the room, we booked the only room that was available at the time, an Executive King Room, and were pleasantly‚Ä¶"
July 2019,An absolute gem!,"I have been going on an annual trip with five of my high school buddies for more than 30 years now.  Typically, we stay at the club level at Ritz-Carlton hotels or at the closest thing we can find to that level of service. This year was our first foray to Europe.  My neighbor and travel agent recommended that we stay at Hotel 41 in London.  He has created a bit of a problem for himself, however, as I don't see how he can top Hotel 41.  What a hidden gem.  The executive lounge is exactly the set-up that we love, a warm and welcoming gathering place for us to hang out in between the day's activities.  The rooms were superb.  But most importantly, the staff was amazing.   Stefan, Patricia and Magdalena in particular were so warm, welcoming and personable that they became an‚Ä¶"
July 2019,Double visit!,"My favourite hotel in London and I got to visit it twice in a month. My husband and I enjoyed a fabulous weekend in June when we were so excited to see the beautifully refurbished roof terrace. A beautiful sunny day in a beautiful spot.   A few weeks later, I returned to 41 to meet up with my cousin and goddaughter who were over from the US. We started on the roof, where Stefan allowed Meaghan, my goddaughter, to perform the sabrage - opening our champagne bottle with a sabre. A really special ambition fulfilled.  We then went back downstairs for a delicious afternoon tea where both Stefan and Steve looked after us so well.  Thank you to Lauren for making all the arrangements and for making both occasions so memorable. The team at 41 are unique!"
July 2019,The best Boutique Hotel in London,"I‚Äôve been staying in London hotels for the last 14 years and have never experienced such fantastic staff and service. The hotel itself is gorgeous and the location perfect for all the best London attractions but what stood out for me was the attention to detail and individual attention this hotel offers. It‚Äôs an absolute gem and would give it 6 stars if I could.  Thank you for a brilliant stay. Kate, Meg and üê∂"
July 2019,Par Excellence ,"      I can‚Äôt believe that it had been 15 yrs since we last stayed at this wonderful hotel. What a mistake and from now on, it will be our London home whenever we visit. The hotel is in a perfect location adjacent to Buckingham Palace so it is centrally located to many of the London districts. Boutique in style, this hotel is very classy, very comfortable. The rooms are extremely comfortable and fully appointed. You will not want for anything and if you happen to require anything else there is always the ‚Äúwhatever, whenever‚Äù hotline. The service at this hotel really is unparalleled and they always make one feel so welcomed and taken care of. The library which also serves as the lounge and breakfast area (and the breakfasts are delicious )is comfortable and serves all the snacks‚Ä¶"
July 2019,An absolute gem...,"I cannot think of enough superlatives to describe this absolute gem but I will try.  First of all the location is fantastic.  You are literally around the corner from Buckingham Palace in one direction and Victoria Station in the other.  The gorgeous St. James Park is right down the road.  The hotel staff couldn't have been more lovely or welcoming from the moment we stepped through the door.  All rooms as well as the Executive Lounge are on the 5th floor.  The Executive Lounge is basically where everything takes place--reception, breakfast, afternoon tea and evening snacks.  The lounge must be experienced to believe it.  The food is delectable.  Afternoon tea is so enjoyable and eloquent.  After a long day of touring, you must stop into the lounge for the most delightful‚Ä¶"
May 2019,A hidden gem,We have just returned from the most amazing stay at hotel 41.   My husband booked the hotel for a treat for our first wedding anniversary. If I‚Äôm honest I didn‚Äôt know the hotel existed but what a hidden gem!  The hotel is located on the fifth floor as it‚Äôs sister hotel next door accommodates the other 4 floors.   The theme of the decor throughout is black and white and is simply beautiful.  On arrival we was greeted with a glass of champagne and was advised we had been upgraded as it was our anniversary. Rather than a executive king room we was staying in the junior suite. What a treat!   The suite was amazing. Where do I start - we was most certainly home from home. Everything you need is available. 3 TVs to choose from with separate sky TV. A beautiful bedroom with a huge bed‚Ä¶
May 2019,Faling ill wasn't the plan but........,"Regular guests at 41, we arrived mid-morning and almost immediately after our welcome glass of champagne, left for a day out with friends.  Early to bed, we succumbed to a virus going around our grandchildren's school and spent a difficult night.  The next morning we informed Lauren, the Resident Manager, who despite having a fully hotel, managed to arrange for us to stay in our room for a second, unplanned night.  There was no way we could have dressed and packed, never mind changed rooms. During that day and evening, the staff could not have been more helpful and understanding, going out to collect medication, offering appropriate light meals and beverages and bringing endless supplies of water, etc whilst respecting our necessary privacy.  Falling ill away from home is always‚Ä¶"
May 2019,Best hotel experience of my life,"We treated ourselves to a night at Hotel 41 as we began our honeymoon so were flying from Heathrow the following day and wanted to start off on the right note. Boy were we not disappointed!  On arrival we were congratulated on our wedding and told we were being upgraded to the conservatory suite. We had booked one of their ""standard"" rooms (although nothing in this place can be called standard). The conservatory suite was OUT OF THIS WORLD. A king-size bed, a separate seating area, a jacuzzi bathtub, 3 TV's (one in the bathroom!) and best of all, a retractable canopy over the bed uncovering the conservatory roof so we could sleep under the stars (well, what stars you could see... this is London after all!)  But I'm getting ahead of myself. The hotel entrance is quite small and‚Ä¶"
May 2019,1st class,My wife and I spent 16 nights total in England and Scottland. We spent 2 nights at Hotel 41. The accomidations and service was 1st class. I would consider this hotel the best of the 7 hotels during our stay in the UK. The staff was very attentive and extremely friendly. Our two breakfasts and one late lunch were delicious. We stayed in the Balmoral Suite which was very spacious and well appointed.  The hotel had a special birthday cake under a glass dome along with an assortment of freshly baked chocolates waiting for us in the room. Thanks Gary 
May 2019,Loved it!,"I had an amazing three night stay (if way too brief!) Completely understand why this boutique hotel is rated so highly. From the luxurious, stylish and comfortable room to the lounge and pantry and the excellent attention to detail from staff, Hotel 41 is an oasis of calm and comfort centred in the heart of London."
May 2019,Still the Best!,"Another wonderful stay at 41! The personal service is attentive and everyone makes you feel extra special and addresses you by name. This time we chose s smaller executive room, which was very cozy, very nicely decorated and well furnished.  Can't beat the location close to Buckingham Palace, the Royal Mews, the Queens's Gallery, and St. James park. Great to relax in the executive lounge with champagne upon check-in, with drinks before dinner, after the theatre for something to eat from the pantry before retiring to bed and last but not least, for their elegantly presented breakfast. As Stefan recommends the Eggs Benedict, he describes it as the ""breakfast of champions"".  Our trip was cut short due to a family emergency but we look forward to returning, when we can stay longer‚Ä¶"
May 2019,A Wonderful Experience ,"It was a fantastic stay. The staff are attentive, friendly and welcoming. the afternoon tea is wonderful and the pantry is a brilliant feature. After coming back from a night out it was great to raid the pantry and have a nightcap. I have been fortunate and lucky to have stayed in many premium hotels all over the world and this was by far the best for me."
May 2019,Hotel 41 delivered the holiday of a lifetime!,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for 8 nights at the beginning of May for a birthday/ anniversary trip.  Hotel 41 is that calm sanctuary that keeps you refreshed and ready to face your day with energy and excitement. All this with true welcome for their city of London. This trip was a year in the making, and I had decided on Hotel 41 early on. About a week before our arrival, I began to get nervous and thought my expectations were too high for Hotel 41. I worried for nothing! They delivered an amazing holiday experience. Hotel 41 goes above and beyond in the service experience. It is as if they wish to provide you with lifetime memories.  For example, one night while chatting with Oris (name hopefully spelled correctly) we mentioned our potential plans for the next day and‚Ä¶"
May 2019,Our #1 hotel choice for London,"I've been to London numerous times, and had been lucky enough to stay in other 5 star places. Although the other hotels have better amenities (bigger bathrooms, etc), they really are outdone by the SERVICE provided by the Hotel 41 staff (not to mention that free pantry!!!). We didn't have to sign for anything (the staff makes sure they know YOU right from the get go), and any concerns are addressed immediately.  And the location is superb - right in front of the Buckingham Palace, 2 blocks from Victoria underground and the Big Bus stop right in front of the hotel.   And yes it's pricey, but you definitely get the value for your money. We will definitely stay here again when we go back to London town!!!"
January 2019,"Like staying with family, if your family is really wealthy","I'm not trying to be sarcastic. The staff was so attentive and so friendly it was like having family in London. The room we stayed in was decent sized, not one of the suites, but it had enough room for two sisters with a lot of luggage (we arrived after a cruise.) The amenities were fabulous and the location can't be beat. When we needed detailed directions (well, I did since I get lost easily and was trying to get to a pharmacy by myself) one of them even took me most of the way to my destination (by foot) and recommended places for me to shop while I was out and about. I wish I could afford to stay there again, especially during a warmer and drier season. But the hot cocoa in the lobby was always welcome and the blankets were warm and cozy."
February 2019,Set a new standard!,Hotel 41 set a new standard for excellence.  Seldom have I experienced the wonderful staff and enjoyed the attentiveness delivered at this hotel.  Management and owners of the Hotel can be particularly proud of both these people and the excellent facility they operate.  Congratulations in order.  I intend to search out other establishments  in the Red Carnation chain in my future travels.
March 2019,Wonderful place,One of the best places I‚Äôve stayed at in a long time. The staff are magnificent and go above and beyond. The rooms are very clean and look wonderful. I‚Äôll definitely be returning back here soon next time I‚Äôm in the country
February 2019,Just what you want,"Firstly all the five star reviews are correct Attention to detail and customer service are first rate. Everything is as you would expect with a top quality hotel, with the lounge being a perfect refuge from the outside world. Would strongly advise you to visit if in London."
February 2019,London Short Stay Gem,"Great Hotel for a couples weekend in London or short business trip The staff are excellent, the executive lounge is a haven away from the crowds. Short walk to Buckingham palace and the Mall. This park walk takes you straight to Leicester Square  "
December 2018,Superb,"If you ever travel to London Hotel 41 is a must. We enjoyed this super Hotel for a weekend trip in December. Exceptional standard of service, great food and charming atmosphere. Sit with a glas of wine next to the fireplace! The location great too. We loved every aspect of our stay and will return."
February 2019,#1 for many reasons,"Don't bother looking at any other hotels in London, this is hands down the best hotel we have ever stayed in. I won't go into too much detail, but my husband and I felt like royalty staying here. From the turn down service with little treats that surprise you (it was my husbands 40th birthday, and they left a cake and rose petals in our room--SO lovely), to the staff knowing you by name with the friendliest attitude. It was our first time in London, and we simply want to come back just to stay at Hotel 41. Best experience ever!"
February 2019,"Return visit, just as good as last time","This was a return visit after being so impressed the first time about 3 years a go. It didnt dissapoint, from walking in the door to checking out, the service and extra mile the staff go to make sure your stay is extra special, sets this apart from the rest. Its a relatively small hotel so i guess that helps to give the experience a more homely and welcoming feel, a glass of champagne of your choice while you check in, sets the tone. The rooms are classy with the decor unique and you can tell a lot of thought has gone into the design, again to provide everything you need, whilst providing a comfortable and special space. All the amenties you would expect are in the room, but fresh fruit and pettles and a few other touches just make the experience that little bit more special.‚Ä¶"
February 2019,Wedding anniversary visit,Wow. From the moment that we pulled up outside we were welcomed. The concierge took our car. Fabulous check in over complimentary nibbles and choice of champagne. The rooms are perfection and ours came with flowers and cake to celebrate our anniversary. We can't wait to try breakfast.
February 2019,Impeccable service with a personalized touch!,"My family is well traveled and we have been fortunate to stay at many places, including five star luxury hotels. However, the personalized service at Hotel 41 is second to none. Each night there were kind treats and surprises left for our three children at turndown, and the amenities in the executive lounge are truly amazing. Breakfast, tea time, evening ‚ÄúPlunder the Pantry sessions, and more...my 5 year old daughter wants to live here, I think! Unfortunately, my boys and I were pretty sick during most of our visit to London, but the staff at Hotel 41 made this a wonderful stay nonetheless. I have never been more enthusiastic about a hotel!  Thank you to all the kind staff!"
February 2019,No longer a 5-Star Establishment,"I want to start by saying that this was my second time staying at Hotel 41. The first time was 4 years ago and I had an absolutely wonderful experience. I wish I could say the same for my last stay. Hotel 41 was my wife and I's last stop on our honeymoon. We had been traveling for 4 weeks, and I was so excited for her to stay at the hotel I had raved about in the past. Unfortunately that excitement was short lived. There is a very thin line between a 4 and 5 star hotel, and what we experienced at Hotel 41 was at maximum a 4 star experience. Some of the below complaints may seem petty. But that is what separates a 4 and 5 star hotel. At a 5 star hotel they should never be any complaints, especially so many...  1) The first complaint was the air temperature in the room. It was 4C‚Ä¶"
February 2019,Here We Go Again,"When you walk into a place and the first thing somebody says is, ‚ÄòWelcome back Mr and Mrs Gaygan, it‚Äôs lovely to see you again‚Äô, you know you are somewhere truly special.  I spoken before about how wonderful this place is but I never get bored of writing about it. It wasn‚Äôt apprehension about visiting again but I admit to thinking about whether or not it would live up to the previous three visits. Because after all, all good things must come to an end at some point, surely?  As with so many other things, Hotel41 bucks the trend and we felt totally at home even before the lift had taken us to the executive lounge.  The welcome, the room, the food (particularly the croque monsieur), the attention to detail and the care and concern from ALL staff. It was all simply wonderful.  ‚Ä¶"
February 2019,Amazing Hotel ,"I booked this hotel as surprise to celebrate our 4th Wedding Anniversary. And based on the reviews plus the hotel being rated no1 I was excited to arrive!  We were not disappointed - we arrived late due to delayed flights but were still given the same 5 star treatment with champagne and excellent attentive staff on arrival.  Our room was lovely and the bed was extremely comfortable - just what you need after a long day/night around a London!   The hotel even surprised us with an Anniversary cake in our room and other little extras to make the trip feel very special!   The complimentary section at the hotel is also a great added extra - canap√©s, snacks, sweets, ice cream, breads and cheeses - just in case you feel a little peckish.   I can‚Äôt say enough about the wonderful staff‚Ä¶"
February 2019,Amazing ‚ô•Ô∏è,Our second stay and I thought it couldn‚Äôt get any better a beautiful hotel with fantastic service and friendly staff who go above and beyond to make your stay pleasurable.I can‚Äôt wait to stay again soon
February 2019,Just wonderful ,"What an amazing hotel, from the moment we  arrived to the time we checked out, everything was perfect. Impossible to single out any one member of staff as they are all absolutely top class. We stayed at Hotel 41 for a birthday weekend celebration and the extra little touches were a lovely addition, even arranged a surprise treat at our dinner reservation. Would recommend this place to anyone  Mark and Helen"
February 2019,The best send off!,"My wife and I were emigrating from the UK and I wanted to prepare a surprise for her for our last night. I had never heard of Hotel 41 before but was recommended it by a friend who had stayed there and loved it. My wife has a dairy allergy and the staff prepared a dairy-free chocolate cake which they left in our room with a message (written in chocolate!) wishing us luck with our new adventure. The staff were attentive, friendly and approachable, and would ask us about our upcoming move (which was a very nice touch!) My wife was thrilled with the surprise and we'd definitely stay there again when visiting London. Thank you for such a lovely night!"
February 2019,Valentines Day ,"We had been recommended this hotel by a couple we meet while on holiday, a chance meeting and a small comment‚Äùit‚Äôs the best hotel in London ‚Äú meant that upon our return we looked up ‚ÄúHotel 41‚Äù and I booked for 14th February.  It was absolutely perfect for my husband and I. The staff were engaging and polite and nothing was too much trouble. Our room had everything we needed and anything else we required was only a phone call away.  A few things I feel I have to mention. It is the first hotel that we have been to that the all staff domestic maintenance even the window cleaner were exceptional always putting us first. All staff served with a smile and I genuinely believe that they enjoy working at the hotel. We watched returning customers being welcomed like old friends and staff‚Ä¶"
February 2019,truly exceptionnal,"I strongly recommend this hotel. Very nice place, in the center of London (near Buckingham palace). Exceptional quality of service. Rooms and bed are really great. we really appreciated the bottle of champagne offered in our room and the continuous access to high quality snacking, delicious breakfast, and so and so and so... Looking forward to go there again !"
February 2019,Perfection!,"My husband and I chose Hotel 41 for our stay in London in February of 2019. It's hard to put into words how great this hotel is! The staff is what truly makes the experience one of a kind. It's in a great location that is easily walk-able to Buckingham Palace, Parliament, Big Ben etc. We enjoyed cocktails and canapes by the fire every evening before heading out. Perhaps it was just the jet-lag, but the bed was amazing!"
December 2018,Loved every minute,Thank you so much for making my stay amazing and my Birthday. I saw the show Wicked and when I returned back to my room I had a surprise cake and a signed poster from the Wicked cast. Amazing service and great cocktails!
February 2019,"""Best"" and ""Luxury"" are overused. Need more of ""Exceptional"" and ""Impeccable""","We stayed 5 nights. Upon entering the door the concierge Lenny used our name making us feel we're in the right place. The main room albeit short of space is classic, warm and well appointed. Coming to London as tourists kept us busy. We only ate breakfast here and had a gluten free afternoon tea. The house has just 28 rooms, so everything is quaint and quiet. Just the way I like it.   Guests willing to use $800+ a night know what to expect for service ATDs (attention to details). My wife and I certainly maximised our stay however the list of faux pas service issues are quite long and worth mentioning directly to the GM or GSM.    Housekeeping was perfect.  Professional staff worth mentioning; Victoria, Lenny, Vladislav, William, Mitchell, and Lauren.  Overall I love the brand‚Ä¶"
January 2019,Amazing stay... never wanted to leave,We stayed at Hotel 41 and absolutely loved it. The service was amazing and we had such a lovely stay. Everyone was so welcoming and when they heard we were going to the Harry Potter studios they customized a few things specifically for us. The food they have during the evenings was so great and not to mention the ice cream! The rooms are wonderful and we loved reading out in the lounge area by the fire each night. The location can‚Äôt be beat either. Thank you to all that helped make our holiday in London such a wonderful experience!
January 2019,perfect as always,"This is the second time we have stayed at 41 and it is still the most perfect small hotel! The staff are exceptional and the facilities second to none. We ate in the executive lounge and when we returned to our room the staff had turned down the bed, lit the fire, lit candles and spread petals and even placed a hot water bottle in my wife's side of the bed...absolute bliss. This has now become our hotel of choice every time we visit London."
January 2019,Amazing,"We have just returned from Hotel 41 after a 3 night stay to celebrate my husband‚Äôs 60th birthday and I can honestly say this hotel is perfect. From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave nothing is too much trouble for the wonderful staff. By the second day they knew what drink we liked with breakfast and which colour toast we preferred!  We were upgraded to a suite as it was a special occasion and it was so lovely. They really have thought of everything in the rooms, lovely toiletries, robes, slippers, big comfy bed, a pillow menu, a beautiful writing desk, I could go on and on. Anything you want you just phone reception for, even a phone charger as I forgotten mine, someone was sent out to get me one! The breakfast was lovely, I had full English for a couple of days and‚Ä¶"
January 2019,Great Hotel .... especially the service ,"I generally don‚Äôt write reviews. Almost never. But the staff here were so thoughtful and so helpful during my three night stay that I will make an exception. This is simply a great hotel, especially if you‚Äôre on business and use the executive lounge.  The staff are exceptional. I high recommend it. "
January 2019,Exceptional,"This was our second stay and, once again, we were not disappointed! Exceptional service and staff are wonderful, attentive and charming. Our stay was faultless with a beautifully furnished and well appointed room, delicious breakfast, an incomparable selection of treats in 'the pantry', a sublime, relaxed atmosphere in the lounge and thoughtful 'little extras' at turndown.  The staff are thoughtful without being intrusive, and they manage to predict your every need, even before you do! Without doubt, we will return very soon."
January 2019,Wonderdul stay,We stayed only one night but we appreciated the staff and the place. Delicious breakfast. The Chimney fire in our room was very appreciated. Very central position. Everything was wonderful. We will come back later.
September 2018,The best hotel we've stayed at....EVER!,"We booked this hotel through Costco Travel.  It was definitely a splurge for us, but after reading so many great TA reviews, we decided it was worth it and did a cheaper hotel in Paris to compensate.    Their customer service is amazing...even before we arrived in London!   We actually booked them for 7 days, and then discovered we had to move our trip by 1 week.  Unfortunately, it looked like there was a blackout date for all Red Carnation hotels (which Hotel 41 is part of) right in the middle of our new dates, so we couldn't book with them. Costco's travel agent said there was nothing they could do, and recommended I book another hotel.  I contacted Hotel 41 and explained why we needed to move our date (brother-in-law was getting married and booked a venue without knowing we‚Ä¶"
January 2019,Fantastic hotel,My wife and I enjoyed a romantic vacation with superb service from Hotel 41.  We enjoyed starting the day in the executive lounge for breakfast as well as ending it there with snacks.  The staff was very helpful attending to details for us during the day as well.  Can‚Äôt wait to come back!
October 2018,Hotel 41 - a Great Place to Stay in London,Hotel 31 is a wonderful small hotel with individualized rooms.located in the heart of Knightsbridge and close to Buckingham Palace.  The  common areas feel like an upscale London club.  A true hidden gem.  Highly recommended.
December 2018,Perfect as always,"We went for our annual Christmas time visit to Hotel 41 and this time actually stayed over Christmas. We arrived on Christmas Eve and stayed for 4 nights in a split level junior suite which we have stayed in previously.   I honestly cannot give this hotel enough compliments. Everything about it is absolutely perfect. It has to be our favourite hotel in the world. It is just so relaxing and you would never know that you are in the middle of London. All of the staff are very friendly and treat you as a friend and a special mention to Lauren the resident manager who will always stop for a chat.   We have no negative comments to make on our stay and have already booked again for December 2019 for a pre-Christmas break.   In addition to the hotel, the Nova complex is also very nice‚Ä¶"
October 2018,Quite literally my favorite hotel in the world!,"As good as the big five star hotels are (Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, Montage, etc.) they can‚Äôt even begin to compete with the quality and service of Hotel 41. The experience in the executive lounge is unmatched by any other hotel, whether it‚Äôs the extraordinary made to order breakfast menu, afternoon tea, complementary snacks or simply lounging about to read a book, the service is simultaneously unobtrusive and the most attentive I have ever experienced. The subtle and thoughtful touches in the room are beyond compare. Personalized cookies wishing us a good time at the theater; a hot water bottle in our bed when we returned to warm our sheets. Unheard of! If I could choose one hotel to stay at in Europe, this would be the one!"
October 2018,Impeccable service with the Queen as your neighbor.,"Literally right across the street from the Queens residence, the Hotel 41 is a hotel within a hotel, situated on the 5th floor of the Rubens hotel. From the time you enter until the time you check out you cant help but be impressed with the level of service you get from every single hotel employee you meet.  The rooms are a little tight but we did have a king size bed and were able to function fine in the room.  Without even having to go outside you can walk through to the Rubens hotel and have afternoon tea, a great dinner at the English Grill or a drink at one of the bars.   Victoria station and the tube entrance are less than a 5 minute walk. This is a great location for tourists."
October 2018,Service and location second to none!,Before we even arrived on Oct. 29th the staff at the hotel was contacting us to see what they could arrange for us ahead of time. Upon our arrival we were treated like royalty. They gave us champagne and a comfort room to store our luggage and freshen us. Once our rom was ready they upgraded us without our asking. The room was on 2 stories complete with fireplace. The breakfast and afternoon tea were amazing. It is close to some theatres and right next to Buckingham Palace. We will stay here again!
June 2018,God Save the Queen. And 41. ,"My wife and I had the good fortune to stay at this hotel for about a week. The hotel has a great location next to Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station. Essentially, everything in London is within reach. But what makes this hotel special isn‚Äôt the location, nor the building itself. It‚Äôs the employees, who are clearly well trained in hospitality and have an obvious love for what they do. They are kind, friendly, helpful and always seem to have the answers when the questions are asked. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at 41 and will be back when in London again. "
November 2018,Wonderful Experience ,"We opted to celebrate our 12th anniversary with a weekend stay at Hotel41 and were treated to an upgrade. It was a surprise that was very much appreciated and the split-level suite and its facilities were exceptional. There was a handwritten note, a bowl of fruit and later a small cake to welcome us. Housekeeping made sure the room was always in good condition and there were even lotions and a hot water bottle on my bed during evening turndowns. Certainly most thoughtful as unbeknownst, I was suffering from a sprained back.   Staff took time to cater to our needs and made sure that we were comfortable yet were unobtrusive and afforded us privacy. Questions were always answered and requests were looked into very quickly. There were staff that delivered professional service yet‚Ä¶"
October 2018,Beautiful hotel,"Absolutely fantastic hotel, right across the street from Buckingham Pslave. Extremely good service , top notch!!! The only negative would be that the rooms are very small which is not uncommon in Europe. Every night they left something in your room such as chocolates, rose petals etc. I would also highly recommend the tea and dinner at the English Grille in the Ruben. ( essentially hotel 41 is the 5th floor of the Ruben but you have a separate entrance"
October 2018,Stephen,Wonderful hotel full of fantastic attentive staff. Classic English style and atmosphere makes it extra special -a proper London hotel! Loved the executive lounge and all the snacks available on the house. Loved the fire place and fire on my arrival to my bedroom so cozy and inviting.  Bed was lovely and comfortable and the Breakfast was fantastic. Absolutely no complaints I‚Äôll be back.
October 2018,First Visit ,"Thank you for a wonderful first stay. I enjoyed every second of it. All the staff friendly and I thank them for that. Special thanks go to the reception team for booking and then cancelling the dinner reservation several times, to Stephen for his kindness when the week didn‚Äôt go to plan, to the housekeeping staff - I loved the little touches on turndown and all the chefs, kitchen staff, waitresses and waiters the food was superb. I am looking forward to another stay soon. Sue xx"
October 2018,Truly amazing 5* and more,"This was our second visit to hotel 41 as we first visited last year for our 25th anniversary and were so impressed came back for our 26th. This hotel is simply the best, from the moment you step through the door to the moment you leave the service is impeccable and personal. The lounge is a haven to relax in with wonderful food and drinks whenever you want. The rooms are truly Devine, we were lucky enough to be upgraded to the conservatory suite, wow amazing. Im not sure we will ever find a hotel to top 41 and hope we are fortunate enough to be able to return next year."
October 2018,I loved 41 ?,"The hotel was in a great location. We loved the little feeling and attention to guests.  first of all? I am very happy to save money thanks to this magic place: savehotel.ml  the manager, was overdone. She welcomed us and assisted with all our needs. She and her staff really make you feel special. The room was very spacious, clean, large and comfortable.  Will stay again when I am in London."
August 2018,Enchanting hideaway in the centre of London,"This was my second visit, and if at all possible this place is better than on my previous visit.  It‚Äôs a bolt hole, private, and the service is impeccable.   No traffic noise, well appointed rooms and enormously comfortable.  I can only say that we will return again and again.  You will see from other reviews that I am someone who travels the world frequently, and I do have my favourite hotels in different capital cities.  This is the one for London."
August 2018,The best of the best in London,"My second stay at this hideaway in the centre of London.  It is a superb hidden gem in the centre of a busy city.  The quality of this place is unbeatable, and the service and help for guests is like no other in the world.  We will return as we thoroughly enjoyed our short stay."
August 2018,Excellent hotel,"41 made us feel like royalty for a week! Everything was taken care of for us, the staff is so attentive and kind, they also give great recommendations for tour companies and food. The location of the hotel is great as well. I really appreciate how the staff went above and beyond. Thank you all again!"
August 2018,A very good option.,"We have recently enjoyed a three night stay in a split level suite which was a pleasant experience. All staff were helpfull and attentive, all our needs were met and without doubt this hotel does deserve it's ranking amongst the higher echelons of London hotels. Breakfast is a quiet and relaxed affair and the lounge is comfortable.  Our room was a reasonable size with all you would expect for the price paid. The location is excellent, walking is a pleasure and all you need is close at hand.  A big shout out to all the staff we encountered and a big thank you.  This hotel is ran like a Special Forces Unit, 99.9% need not apply!"
December 2017,Outrageously Good,"Well, what can I say. I was left spellbound by their service and the comfort and amenities.  The location is absolutely amazing.  If you have the money, go for it. You won't regret it. Even at this price, this gives you the highest bang for the buck in such a central location of London."
July 2018,The Hotel that keeps on delivering a 5-star experience‚Ä¶,"I‚Äôve left my fair share of reviews every time we come back to 41Hotel, for a very good reason!   This Hotel is and absolutely deserves to be number 1!   The service, personalised experience, familiar faces, staff and location all make for this hotel being one easy way to get comfortable when travelling back to London and almost has a way of making you feel ... like you never left or that you're part of the family!   Another exceptional stay which has a lot to do with the staff.  Thank you again!"
August 2018,Nice find,Travelling its fun and sometimes tiring I'm so glad I stayed here. Very clean and great service. Worth every penny. Highly recommend to you all travellers or even if you visiting this place is just amazing find. See u next time :). Thank you
July 2018,Luxury at its finest!,"I found Hotel 41, here on trip advisor. My husband and I came to London as a part of our 20th wedding anniversary. I cannot express enough about this hotel! The staff put effort in every detail. We arrived and checked in early from a red eye flight. The staff took our luggage and guided us to the executive lounge to complete check in. First, we were offered a delicious complimentary glass of champagne. Our room wasn‚Äôt quite ready, which we expected. We stayed in the executive lounge and were presented with snacks and comfort while we waited (no more than 15 minutes). After arriving to the room, In which Adele assisted us to; along with giving us information and plenty of advice of things to do, we slowly took in the details of this beautiful room in 01. Very beautiful and clean.‚Ä¶"
July 2018,Hotel 41 Meets The Royal Standard of Excellence,"My stay at 41 more than exceeded my expectations. From cheerful manners, attentive service, exceptional surroundings, practical help, delicious food and fine conversation, the entire staff enriched my trip to London in every possible way. I was treated like a highly honored guest.  "
October 2017,Best of the best,"Perfect location, one of the best hotels I have ever been to . The staff is friendly, good looking and well trained! We had maybe the best Beef Wellington we ever tried and despite the high rates we will definetely return back here! Cheers to John, Liza and Pawel for everything!"
September 2018,Birthday trip,"This is my second time staying at Hotel 41 and it was wonderful! This visit was with my mom and aunt. My aunt had several special dining and room requests and the staff were incredibly accommodating. We were visiting for my mom's birthday and the hotel had a special piece of birthday cake waiting for her in our room, such a lovely touch. All of the staff are just really top notch, I can't say enough about the support from my initial emails with Adele, to Lauren, Victoria and Gabriel once at the hotel. Thank you for such an amazing visit."
September 2018,Small but miraculous!!!!,"Everything was perfect! Our arrival was warm with a glass of champaign. The Room was very comfortable with enough space for our suitcases and absolutely marvellous! Every detail is special, even the slippers were separated with 'His' & 'Hers' bags! The amenities were wonderfoul and the maids were adding the missing ones. the breakfast also, even though the place is quite small, had almost everything! Everybody makes you feel like a Queen & a King! many thanks!"
September 2018,Luxury hotel!!,"Me and my wife stayed at this hotel for one night,just to try an exclusive hotel during our stay in London  Everything,from the staff,the decor , the detail and the atmosphere generally,was perfect. The breakfast was delicious .The private lounge was beutiful  The room including the bathroom was extremely spacious. Location was perfect with a short walk from Victoria Station. It is a short way if you want to visit the Royal Mews which is located just across the street from the hotel. Buckingham Palace is a just down the street. The drinks in the executive lounge after a day of sightseeing is really relaxing. Absolutely worth a visit"
August 2018,Simply the best,"If you enjoy the chi-chi chic, bling-bling, ostentatious type of 5 star hotel, well, Hotel 41 is not for you. However, if you enjoy unassuming elegance, uncompromising quality, and superior personalised service, then you'll absolutely love this boutique hotel. Located on the 5th floor of the buildlng, you could pass by the discrete entrance of this hotel without noticing it. But as soon as you present yourself at the door, that first impression of extremely attentive service is not just an impression. We were  welcomed with a glass of champagne and small hors d'oeuvres, while we waited just 15 minutes or so as they finished preparing our room, requested for early check-in.. We felt pampered throughout our 7 day stay. Rooms are of a very respectable size, spotlessly clean, and‚Ä¶"
September 2018,Continues to be the best,"We arrived from an overnight flight at 8:a.m., tired and bedraggled, knowing our check in time wasn‚Äôt for hours.Although our room wasn‚Äôt ready, Hotel 41 brought our luggage to a ‚Äúcourtesy room,‚Äù which was one of their standard rooms, where we napped until our booked room was ready. Hotel 41 then upgraded us to a junior suite. The service, as always, was perfect. This is truly a great hotel and I can‚Äôt wait to come back."
July 2018,1st visit to London ,"Absolutely loved my 6 days in Hotel 41. The rooms were comfortable, the pillows my favourite!The staff just gave you their utmost service. Nothing was beyond them in trying to please and make our stay memorable. We would love to return to this splendid Hotel. Superb in every way ! "
September 2018,Our Recent Stay,This is a 28 room boutique hotel located on the 5th floor with a small ground floor entry. The service is excellent and what you would expect and desire....best service I have ever experienced while travelling. The rooms are cozy and very comfortable...shower is excellent and set-up as a rain shower and they have a separate bathtub with shower. The bath products are wonderful...Penhaligon's of London....brought these back with us. The hotel is located adjacent to the Royal Mews which is part of Buckingham Palace. There are several Bar/Restaurants as part of a outdoor pavilion to the left of the hotel as you leave if you get hungry or want a drink at night. One tip for this area and London in general...there are several street closures due to construction so give yourself extra‚Ä¶
September 2018,London,"Can I rate more than 5 stars?  Wonderful hotel with wonderful people.  Odd little place, only the 5th floor of Rubens Hotel, but what charm!  Lots packed into a small space.  In London to celebrate birthday and 25th anniversary and I actually felt cherished by the whole staff.  Patrycja's smiling face every morning at breakfast a bonus. One block to Buckingham Palace, one block to Victoria Palace Theatre to see Hamilton. Excellent hotel, excellent trip.  I would return to 41 any time in London."
September 2018,Superb!!!,"Visited with my wife on her birthday and, having held our wedding at another Red Carnation hotel, had high expectations which were more than met by the warm, friendly welcome and marvellous service we experienced throughout our stay.  The room was extremely comfortable and of a good size, well presented and maintained. The champagne on ice, candles and rose petals arrayed when we returned from our evening out was a fabulous touch and made for an even more memorable occasion.  Breakfast was brilliant, and they catered for my wife‚Äôs vegan diet superbly well.  You will not be disappointed at Hotel 41!   "
September 2018,The friendliest staff,"The staff truly make a stay at 41 exceptional. They are so friendly and so willing to help. The location of this hotel is perfect, so close to Buckingham Palace. The tube station Victoria is less than a 5 minute walk and allows you to be anywhere fast.  Breakfast is delicious and includes some real British treats.  We thoroughly enjoyed the Afternoon Tea that we booked as an extra.  The snacks available all day and night are also delicious. Our room was perfect."
August 2018,FABULOUS Hotel! Attention to detail is unrivaled.,"I made a great choice selecting Hotel 41 as the destination to celebrate my 50th Birthday. It was the attention they gave to the smallest details that made my stay extra special. It begin upon my arrival, with having my room ready way before the advertised 2:00pm check-in. I was amazed when I got to my room, they had a small birthday cake and sweets for me. Part of my trip included seeing the musical Hamilton, and to my shock they prepared macaroons with the logo for Hamilton, and an note to enjoy the show.Turn down service with candles and rose petals and a staff that was attentive, helpful and available to handle your every request puts Hotel 41 above all the rest. I would definitely stay here again. Loved every minute of my visit."
September 2018,We will be back!,"Thank you for such a special visit. So happy I came across this little gem of a hotel when looking for something very special and a little bit different for my husbands 40th birthday treat.  We were both sad to leave today after being looked after so well where all the staff actually took the time to get to know us by name and do everything possible to ensure we had a great weekend. The birthday champagne and cake were also lovely gestures!!  A big shout out to Steve Jones - a really interesting guy happy to share all his tips and travel ideas. We would love to come back soon to try out the new roof top terrace ;) This hotel is well worth the price tag! Great value for a hotel of this quality in London.  Thanks again, Sarah and Gareth Evans x"
August 2018,BOUTIQUE HOTEL - EXCEPTIONAL,"We have once again stayed at Hotel 41 - without a doubt it is one of the best hotels we have stayed in - exceptional service, surroundings and facilities.  When you walk in it is like walking into your own oasis of peacefulness and wonderful staff who are there to help you.  Special thanks to Magdalena, Lauren Hargrave, Lauren & Marlen whose help was invaluable.  We will be back next year to sample the wonderful hospitality received at Hotel 41.  Thanks once again from the both of us."
August 2018,One of the best hotels we have stayed in,This discrete boutique hotel is one of the best places we have stayed in. Tucked away above the Reubens Hotel it is ideally placed for sightseeing in the capital< Although quite small it has all the facilities you need and much more besides. The staff are incredibly attentive and nothing is too much trouble. Breakfast was good and there were a range of snacks available throughout the day. Rooms are a good size and very well equipped. It is quite expensive but definitely value for money
August 2018,Magnificent ,"Gorgeous boutique style hotel located very close to Buckingham Palace. It‚Äôs a small hotel next to the much larger Ruebens Hotel. The reception team make you feel so welcome on arrival. The glass of champagne and canap√©s were a welcome treat after a long car journey. The rooms are lovely. Mainly decorated in black and white. They are very modern, but classically English at the same time.. a unique blend of interior design. The staff are very helpful for reservations, advice etc. The breakfast is lovely and hot dishes are cooked to perfection. Breakfast should be savoured that this place... don‚Äôt rush it.. it‚Äôs simply divine. The lounge area with sweet treats is a lovely touch. We were treated to a room upgrade part way through our stay which was a lovely gesture and allowed us to‚Ä¶"
August 2018,"Lovely hotel, great staff","Stayed for a couple of nights, the hotel is great and the staff are very good.   Wr didnt have breakfast but the canapes later in the day were very nice.   The location is fab, 5 mins from Victoria so great transport links.   The bedrooms are well appointed if somewhat small but the whole hotel is quirky (good).    Attention to detail by the staff is excellent.  The toiletries provided are high end.  The shower is amazing, phenomenal water pressure.  Beds are comfy.    Lovely as a treat and perfect for a special occasion, not sure id stretch to this price point unless it was a special occasion. "
August 2018,Another incredible stay,"We had a three night stay and had a wonderful time.  All of the staff were amazing, remembering what we liked to eat and drink on the first day, and making us feel extremely comfortable from the beginning of our time at the Hotel 41.  The 41 is an intimate boutique hotel, with excellent and personalized customer service.  We will certainly return to the hotel when we‚Äôre in London."
August 2018,Simply amazing,"We stayed at the hotel for our anniversary . All I can say is  it was just beautiful was start to finish . The staff , the decor , the attention to detail and the atmosphere simply perfect. I‚Äôve been lucky enough to stay at beautiful hotels all over the world , but this one is magnificent. Everyone in the place cares . They lit candles in the evening for when we returned , the breakfast is delicious . The private lounge beautiful . I love it all . Had a fabulous time and would recommend you stay . Basically the best hotel in London , I‚Äôve stayed at all the big pricey places . Never again , I‚Äôll be back here . One day they might adopt me and I can just live there full time ."
August 2018,Perfect!,"We just returned from a 10th anniversary trip to London and Edinburg.  I spent much time researching the right hotels for our trip.  Hotel 41 was simply amazing!  The staff were all friendly and extremely helpful and everyone knew our names!  They had a special anniversary cake and bottle of champagne for us which was so incredibly special.    The room including the bathroom was extremely spacious.  Location was perfect.  Just a short walk to Victoria Station.  We really enjoyed our visit to the Royal Mews which is located across the street from the hotel.  Buckingham Palace is a little further down the road.  The complimentary treats throughout the day, canap√©s in the evening, ice cream and late night pantry are all additional benefits of this hotel at no additional cost. ‚Ä¶"
August 2018,One Night Theatre Visit,"It is really hard to get the correct tone for this review as so many brilliant and colourful reviews already exist.  There is little point in repeating what is already plain, almost all of which we would agree with, highlighting the exceptional care are friendliness of the hotel team and the intimate ‚Äúclub‚Äù like feel.  Our room was a little dim looking into a very unattractive courtyard which was a little disappointing but not disastrous.  Is it the best hotel in London?  This depends what you want from a hotel, but based entirely on the fact we stayed at another of their wonderful hotels, The Milestone, I would say it could only possibly be 2nd best.  A lovely stay nevertheless.  "
July 2018,Am I too old to say OMG!?,"Third visit to Hotel41 and I still get goose bumps thinking about it.   Not sure that there is anything else to say that hasn‚Äôt already be said. This place is simply perfect. Yes it is expensive but worth every single penny because of the way you are treated and the attention to detail that is given to every aspect of the visit.  My suggestion is as follows. Stop reading the reviews and just book. Go! Take the significant other in your life, pack a bag and get there.  Thank you Hotel41. For everything. See you for visit number 4 some time in 2019."
July 2018,Sublime,It's hard to know where to begin with this review. With a heavy heart I have just returned back to the 'real world' of my own home and the daily grind of real life and work. The office is looming ominously for me in the morning yet my mind is a million miles away from it: I'm reflecting so fondly over the last 24 hours during my all to brief stay at Hotel 41.   I still smell sweetly of the Penhaligons products supplied. I wanted to take them all home with me but I resisted the temptation. I also wanted to take away the monogrammed soft fluffy towels. And the sheets. And even just one of the pillows from the huge pillow menu. And the robes. And the slippers. And even the unique piped fragrance throughout the hotel (which I believe I'll be able to in a few months time I'm told as‚Ä¶
May 2018,Favorite hotel in London,Great location with an excellent and attentive staff. The rooms are lovely and was delighted by the daily snacks - what a nice surprise. Every detail is carefully thought out. We look forward to our next visit!
July 2018,Simply exquisite ,"This is an exceptional hotel. It has really earned its top ranking on multiple sites. It is   Boutique with only 28 rooms, situated within walking distance of Buckingham palace, Westminster Cathedral and Victoria station. The small extra you pay here compared to other hotels in the area is worth the high level of service and comfort offered.  We were greeted at the door and taken to the executive lounge to check in. Instead of the usual check in desk, we sat down in the lounge where we were offered our choice of champagnes. In the executive lounge there is a selection of complimentary snacks throughout the day. They even offer ice cream. The room was luxurious, clean and comfortable. All food and drinks we had were great.  The attention to detail by all of the staff was‚Ä¶"
June 2018,A wonderful stay at a wonderful hotel!!,"I had seen this hotel in TripAdvisor and had  always wanted to visit!! My mum and I decided to stay as a joint Christmas and birthday present and we were not disappointed!! We were greeted at the door and waited for someone to show us up to the fifth floor where the main of the hotel is located. When we arrived on the correct floor we were taken to the Executive Lounge to check in. We were welcomed with a lovely glass of champagne whilst we filled out the details needed which was a lovely way to begin our stay!! Following this we were shown to our room which was delightful!! I love the black and white theme that runs through the hotel and the room was perfect!! Not large, but perfect for what we wanted!! Lovely comfortable twin beds, writing desk, sofa and tv area and a‚Ä¶"
July 2018,Exceptional everything during our third stay at Hotel 41,"I cannot fathom coming to London and staying anywhere else. Hotel 41 is beautiful, the food and cocktails incredibly delicious and the delightful staff helped with all our bookings and coordinated drivers for our party of four. I had a snafu in which tickets had to be picked up and there was no way for us to physically make it by before the event. Hotel 41 arranged for someone to pick them up. We were introduced to what is now our favorite new gin cocktail, made with Gin Mare, a rosemary sprig and two Spanish olives by Steve. Another gentleman on staff, Steph, recommended a straight razor shave and place to get one for the guys that they thoroughly enjoyed. I will be back as soon as I can! Thanks for all Hotel 41!!!"
July 2018,Out of this world!,"From arrival to leaving we have never felt so well looked after nor spoilt in any hotel.  Upon arrival we were greeted by a really friendly young man in the lobby, who seemed genuinely interested in making us feel comfortable and relaxed. The lobby has snacks and drinks that are there to refresh you on arrival and departure. We were then taken up to the 5th floor lounge to check in. Stefan brought over a selection of champagned and made a great recommendation for me to try (as I have no clue nor a distinguished palette).  We were a little early so we were offered some canapes (cheese straws, egg dip and olives) with our drinks whilst we relaxed in the lounge.  The lounge has a mini freezer with around 12 different flavours of Jude's ice cream that you can help yourself to‚Ä¶"
July 2018,Wow,"Brilliant from the minute you step through the door. Very welcoming staff (glass of champagne, anyone?) and the hotel itself is beautifully quirky. We didn‚Äôt make the most of the (free) ice-cream bar so that‚Äôs my excuse to go back."
June 2018,Just Wonderful,"An Unforgettable experience, Never felt like a hotel ,more like an exclusive club. Staff went beyond expectations and made our 2 day stay even more pleasant. I would highly recommend this hotel to all "
July 2018,Prepare to be Pampered,"The Hotel 41 is one of the finest hotels I have stayed in. The staff is universally excellent--friendly and helpful. From the welcome in the lobby to registration on the fifth floor, to the staff in the lounge, everyone was so pleasant and knowledgeable.  Stefan in the lounge offered us great advice in local museums and history and the lounge setting itself is very special. Sort of like having your own English club, with tasty dishes, snacks and drinks throughout the day and night.  Breakfast service as also outstanding with a wide variety of breakfast items for all tastes.  The hotel rooms are extremely well appointed, including virtually everything one needs for a restful stay. The rooms are quite spacious by London hotel standards and all very quiet, since they are on the‚Ä¶"
February 2018,Fabulous,"I was booked for 2 nights first, after 2 I‚Äôve decided do stay here for my entire business trip.  Rooms are spacious and comfortable, clean. Food is delicious! Staff are helpful, they will go forward to make your stay perfect. Definitely would recommend"
June 2018,London Luxury,We stayed here twice for a total of six nights. The staff remember your names and provide outstanding services. The hotel is above the Rubens Hotel and related. The facilities are well done and stylish. We have stayed at many other London hotels but would consider this to be our new London home. It is in a walkable and safe location with good restaurants and theaters nearby. Worth it!
June 2018,I think they invented 6-star service,"Seriously, I've never had service so attentive anyplace, and I've been to some swanky places. This is a small hotel so you get a lot of personal attention from the staff - I'm still trying to figure out how everyone knew my name on the first day. You'll read about the executive lounge a lot in other reviews, and it is a very nicely appointed room that you'll walk through a lot on the way to your room and the check in and check out. Don't expect to make your way through that room without stopping for an assortment of drinks, canapes, and other goodies - the staff will just make sure it magically happens for you. During breakfast and dinner times more substantial food is offered as well.  The room itself was well appointed and the bed was quite comfortable. It is small, so don't‚Ä¶"
November 2017,Five star experience ,"Took my husband to London to celebrate his 40th birthday.  Stayed over a weekend in a double room.  Fantastic welcome, beautiful room, only issue was that we walked everywhere and had to resist the concierge's urge to sort us out with taxis!  Food at breakfast plentiful and varied and snack ""larder"" available later in the day although we had so many lovely nights out we didn't need to avail ourselves.  Great luxury London base."
July 2018,There is simply no place better,"The room was very comfortable, with every amenity. Staff were very attentive. There is a lounge where snacks, ice cream, and fruit are complimentary and available from morning to night.  The staff very kindly allowed my visiting family to use the lounge for an afternoon.  Couldn‚Äôt be better."
July 2018,Sometimes perfection comes in the form of responding to challenges,"This boutique hotel is simply incredible.  I cannot list enough superlatives to describe its rooms, comfort, food and most of all the hospitality and staff.  From the minute you check in the staff makes you feel special and they truly want you to have a wonderful stay.  They helped us set up tours, rides, reservations for dinners and transportation to and from the airport..  In the Executive Lounge daily pantry snacks, drinks and even free dinner dishes are served lounge And is free.  Alex, Jonnais, and Jean Nicholas were just incredible to us during our stay.  The turn down service at night is just wonderful and you really feel special after a dinner or night activity with snacks, gifts and candles.  All the personalized service and touches make this place very special.  It was‚Ä¶"
July 2018,"Whatever, Whenever","Let me start out by saying they people at Hotel 41 are top notch.  They will do whatever it takes to make your stay better and help you enjoy your time at the hotel and London.  Marlen was especially helpful in putting together a surprise for my wife upon arrival.  I had purchased Wimbledon tickets and wanted to surprise my wife.  Marlen procured a piece of astro-turf, tennis ball, strawberries and cream, Lanson Champagne and a card from my dictation and set it all up for us in the room.  It was perfect.  That perfection continued, but in a different way.  Our first night we didn't sleep too well.  I felt the room was noisy and the AC (thank goodness for it during a heatwave) was blowing directly on the bed.  I brought it to the staff's attention, and they sprung into action. ‚Ä¶"
July 2018,Pure Luxury,"There is no place like 41.  We have been fortunate to stay several times in the last few years, including an 8 day 'friends and family' visit in 2016 during which we treated as such; friends and family.   41 is ideally located for those who like to explore on foot.  The hotel is across the street from the Royal Mews / Buckingham Palace. It is an easy 10 minute stroll to the Birdcage Walk and both St. James Park and Green Park are within 15 minutes as is Westminster Abbey.  Recently Nova Food has emerged across the street with a multitude of food and drink options which are handy as well if you are lucky enough to have theatre tickets for Hamilton; something we were able to secure through the hotel on our most recent visit.  41 is about service. We have established great‚Ä¶"
December 2017,Impeccable hotel,"I got engaged in Hotel 41 so it definitely holds a special place in my heart anyway, but I don't think you could describe the hotel as anything other than pure luxury.  The rooms are super spacious given the location. All the staff go above and beyond and nothing is too big or small an issue for them to help with. I know Florent helped my now fianc√© out a lot when planning the engagement surprise.   The little touches such as your glass of champagne on arrival, the ice cream available in the executive lounge and hot chocolate when headed out really added to our stay. The hotel is so grand and luxurious, in such a great location in London and just went above and beyond for us - I really hope we make it back in the near future to stay again. I would happily recommend this hotel to‚Ä¶"
June 2018,Wonderful experience!,"An absolute gem! Lovely atmosphere and amazing staff. Open pantry gives an extra value, especially when you travel alone, not too keen to spend every night eating out. Hotel location is super, close to parks, tourist attractions and public transportations.  Highly recommended! /Emilie A"
June 2018,Amazing Discrete Hotel,Large comfortable room with all of the amenities you would expect.  The huge difference is the staff who competently and quickly responded to our questions and needs.  They were so welcoming--yet professional--that we felt like we were staying with friends.  All of their suggestions were perfect for our needs.  Delicious treats with cocktails.  A freezer full of ice cream for your snacking any time.  The morning breakfasts were excellent.   Everything was great--and we will recommend the hotel to everyone.  Thanks.
July 2018,Fabulous Service,We stayed a Saturday night and were very impressed.  Quite a discrete entrance as this hotel doesn‚Äôt shout like most properties for this luxury do.  The staff were fantastic and very helpful.  The interior is great and the rooms well furnished. 
July 2018,Outstanding attention to detail and customer comfort,This warm and welcoming hotel was a dream! The staff are polite and extremely professional. Endless delightful food items are offered throughout the day complimentary to guests. The rooms are clean and the bed is comfortable. Fabulous stay!
July 2018,40th birthday treat,There is a good reason 41 is so highly rated by its visiting customers. It is their outstanding attention to customer care and comfort. The room assigned though not terribly spacious had every comfort feature you could possibly want. The bed was particularly comfortable with a perfectly balanced duvet. Of the right weight too. The highly branded 41 property will leave you wondering what else could they have done for you to remember 41. It's not all the 41 logos that you see on everything but the human interaction of the amazing staff. Including the highly experience South African F&B manager whose recommendations one should listen to. He will charm you to dizzying heights. That is what you will remember best from 41. The rest can be chaulked as world class creature comforts but‚Ä¶
April 2018,"Brilliant hotel, with staff who go out of their way to help you","This was our second time staying at Hotel 41, and it was even better than the last time. When planning the trip we had booked a world class restaurant for one of the nights. However two weeks before we arrived the menu changed to one where I would not be able to eat anything on the menu. After trying to organise something with the restaurant, we decided to find something else. We contacted Hotel 41 and the concierge staff were superb and quickly provided multiple options covering a large range of foods. When we picked one, Hotel 41 then arranged everything for us. Once we arrived, the staff were excellent, asking what our plans were and if there was anything that they could help with (including organising tickets to the more popular shows). The room was well laid out and‚Ä¶"
June 2018,4th stay and still out of this world ,Wow this place still keeps amazing me. It‚Äôs lovely to return here feels like home from the moment we arrived we had a lovely greeting with champagne. Our room was as beautiful as always and those little touches still make a difference. The little gifts we get on the bed when you have a turn down are such a nice thought. The slippers are so comfy that is all we wear when In the hotel we have breakfast in them. Totally feel so relaxed and welcomed. We had chance this time to meet a lovely guy Stefan who works there. He was such a delight to have conversations with. A perfect gentleman. We stayed In one night and were planning our wedding Stefan made sure we were always topped up with a drink and nibbles. The staff there can not do enough for you. Perfect stunning place our‚Ä¶
June 2018,Why oh why oh why.......,......Can‚Äôt I award Hotel 41 six stars?  Once again Lauren and her team have excelled themselves. Absolutely nothing is too much trouble for them. A lovely surprise was the anniversary cake in our room.
June 2018,Family trip to London,"Unbelievable experience!  We have traveled to many, many places and stayed in some of the finest hotels and have never received as good of service as we experienced at Hotel 41.  The location and rooms were great but it is the staff that truly separates this hotel.  We highly recommend it!"
May 2018,Perfect in Every Way,"I have chosen to stay at Hotel 41 several times because the team makes me feel truly at home. I always refer to it as my home away from home.  From the moment I see the doorman in his stately uniform, the fabulous concierge to the minute I step onto the elevator I am transported to another world. A glamorous world filled with lots of beauty, joy, and heartfelt graciousness. Reception!.  From the first glass of champagne ( yes rose) to the lovely appetizers, chatting away with the lovely staff and guests who could ask for anything more....but there is more.  I had just returned from a visit to India which was not one of the finest trips I have taken and had returned with high anxiety and the staff were so kind to look after me as I had not slept in days and what a better night's‚Ä¶"
June 2018,Made our honeymoon ,Trust is the word to use when it comes to the 41 hotel. We decided to stay there for our honeymoon and it was the best choice we could make! My new wife has coeliac disease so everything has to be gluten free. They also baked gluten free buns and brownies specially for her. The staff are beyond professional and incredibly helpful. Check in was quick and effortless. Room was immaculate. Breakfast was divine and they make one of the finest martini‚Äôs in London. Hotel 41 is the only place we will pay for when visiting London again. 
May 2018,Home from Home,"Over 2000 excellent reviews and a number one rating on tripadvisor is very well deserved indeed!   Hotel 41 is all about customer service and the small details, from the moment you walk through the door, every detail is perfect in every way! Check in with a glass of champagne as your luggage is taken to your room and enjoy some treats in the beautiful executive lounge before discovering your lovely room.  We were delighted to find a compimentary bottle of champagne on ice along with handmand chocolates and a selection of fresh fruit.  The staff at 41 really go the extra mile to make sure that your experience exceeeds your expectations at every opportunity in a way that makes you really feel like you are home away from home. ""Plunder the pantry is a must.""  We would like to also‚Ä¶"
May 2018,Better than expected,"I had never stayed in a small boutique hotel, but now I am hooked. Hotel 41 is elegant,  intimate and friendly.  We felt as though we were visiting dear friends who told their staff to treat us like family. Food and drink are available all day in the lounge and, after one day, they knew our preferences. The staff is superb. We loved coming ""home"" after a busy day of sight-seeing and shopping or an evening at theater to relax in the lounge with a snack and a drink. As I expected, the rooms are a little small, but beautifully appointed.  The location, right across from Buckingham Palace, is so convenient.  We could walk almost anywhere. I highly recommend Hotel 41."
May 2018,Lovely rooms,"Absolutely Nice and clean room&bathroom, we liked the luxury design with my husband. The breakfast was really tasty I had sirloin steak my husband had a salmon. We'll go back soon again thank you for the experience"
May 2018,Breathtakingly wonderful,"A small corner of insanely luxurious tranquility, just a minute‚Äôs walk from Victoria Underground Station. It seems impossible to believe that this is central London. The place is absolutely spotless, no mean feat for an older building with much wood panelling and lots of old books lining the walls. Everyone knows your name as soon as you walk through the door and nothing is too much trouble. I especially loved the ‚ÄòWhatever, whenever‚Äô button on the phone!  We were here for a ‚Äòbig‚Äô wedding anniversary, mentioned it in the booking and were treated like royalty the whole time we were there. My only regret is that we had just one night. We will most definitely be heading back to our newly found London bolt hole.   Many thanks to the incredible staff who made our stay from 28-29 May‚Ä¶"
May 2018,Simply the best...,"41 is no doubt the best establishment that we have stayed in London by far ‚Äì and we have stayed in many 5 star hotels believe me during our various weekends away in London. I wanted to find a special treat for my partner‚Äôs birthday and seeing Wicked was amazing but staying at 41 was ‚Äòthe icing on the cake‚Äô.  The attention to detail and the attentiveness of the staff surpassed our expectations and it was actually a joy to spend time in the Executive Lounge as it was so perfect ‚Äì the staff just knew when to attend and also when to leave alone ‚Äì all very satisfying.  Many thanks to Lauren, Marlen, the Doormen, the Executive Lounge staff, etc for the best experience of our lives in London so far. I think this will be difficult to top.  We hope to see you all soon in not the distant‚Ä¶"
May 2018,Absolutely wonderful!,"From the minute we walked into Hotel 41, we knew this was going to be an extraordinary hotel and we were correct. We arrived in London fairly early and even though check-in was not until the afternoon, they promised our room would be ready shortly and invited us to use another room to shower/freshen up/nap while we waited. The check in process with complimentary champagne was a nice touch.   We had booked a split level junior suite and it was gorgeous. The layout worked very well for us and it was so spacious. The bathroom had a huge soaking tub and separate shower.   The service at this hotel really sets it apart. Everyone went out of their way to make sure we didn't need or want for anything during our stay. We were here for 3 nights and I cannot think of one negative during‚Ä¶"
May 2018,Exceptional service and attention to detail,I have stayed at many of the best hotels around the world and the team at 41 provide the sort of personalised service and attention to detail that puts them right up there with the best in class. The kindness shown to myself and my wife really made our stay at 41 an experience rather than just a night spent in yet another luxury hotel.
April 2018,"Second visit, equally as perfect as before","We returned to Hotel 41 whilst in London to celebrate my wife's birthday. This was our second visit and was as perfect as the first (2 years ago). The Hotel team are fantastic, nothing is too much effort, and without even mentioning it, they knew it was my wife's birthday (checked from our previous visit) and made our stay even more special. I cannot fault this hotel, from the moment you step in until the minute you leave you are made to feel special. Will certainly return again."
April 2018,Nice place to stay ,I was stayed there for one night only.  The hotel is really  so beautiful and look like old. Very well decorated with  nice food. Service is really top of the noche staff is very courteous and attentive.. Hotel location is prime.. Nice place to stay here.. 
November 2017,"Superb service,beautiful classic hotel "," We were travelling as honeymoon...We had 14 hours flight from HK to London. They are so jice to give us a temporary room for refreshments and rest! It‚Äôs so important after a long flight...location is good as It is easy to walk from Victoria Station to the Hotel...just about 5 mins...room size is good and beautiful, bathroom is classic! the most surprising is they sent a gift basket to another hotel on next day...as for apologise for a minor shortfall .... wow...even only some snacks...but this gesture really impressed us! So much thanks for all of your excellent service! Definitely will come back!  "
May 2018,Our perfect hideout,"Our regular business trips take us to 41.  We would stay nowhere else.  On this occasion we returned to The Curry Room situated downstairs through the bar in The Rubens, which was every bit as good as we remembered and no getting wet or trying to find a taxi in the rain.  If you really enjoy an authentic curry, have a look at the menu.  This is as good as it gets.  Service and knowledge impeccable and curries full of flavour rather than just mouth-cringing heat.  This is not what it is about.  My husband had the pork vindaloo (choice of pork or beef) whilst I had the Natal lamb, both of which were splendid.  All but one table was occupied by the time we left at 9pm, and the place hums with enthusiasm from both guests and staff.  The Curry Room pleasingly offers exceptional value‚Ä¶"
April 2018,Real Luxury,"Staying in this hotel was like being on a luxury cruise - the service was impeccable and personal, the beds were comfortable, the linens fine, and there was some type of food available in the kitchen all the time. My personal pet peeve in hotels is the quality of their towels.  I love big and fluffy towels, which I rarely get in hotels; but here, they were huge, and lush. On our last night in London, my husband and I went to see Hamilton.  We were very excited and told one of the stuff about that.  When we came back after the show, we found macaroons with Hamilton insignia imprinted on them, a red rose, and rose petals strewed all over the room!  I mean, I have never....!!!!!"
May 2018,A wonderful stay in a fabulous hotel,"One again everything was fabulous, beautiful spacious rooms, very friendly approachable staff, who go out of their way to make sure you have a wonderful time at Hotel 41. lots of little extras such as champagne on arrival, chocolates in room, fresh fruit, ice cream, sweets and treats in the afternoon, pillow menu and many other wonderful little touches. The beds are divine, spacious and so comfortable. Our family joined us in the evening for drinks and were made to feel very welcome by staff."
May 2018,Just as expected!,"Located in the heart of London near the victoria station and the Buckingham Palace, the 41 is an outstanding hotel. The hotel is perfectly run by a group of polite and extremely motivated staff. Clearly the employees love what they do and take care of the needs of the guests diligently. The rooms are spacious and clean, there are personal touches that make the stay very pleasant. I will be returning to this property with my family because there is such a homey feeling and my parents will certainly enjoy the personal touch and the superb social areas. There are many perks included."
May 2018,Perfect Hotel for a London Break,"Our experience at the Hotel 41 was absolutely perfect. I wanted to find a special place to celebrate my Wife's 60th birthday and this hotel certainly ticked all the boxes. From the moment we stepped into the building we were made to feel like we were the only guests in the place. The interior design is stunning and impeccably decorated throughout. It feels more like a home than a hotel, and the layout is perfect for a restful stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and took time to chat to us throughout our stay which is something I've never experienced before. The room was bright and clean, with so many thoughtful touches we wanted for nothing throughout our 2-day stay. I can easily understand why this hotel is currently the number 1 hotel in London, it is a perfect‚Ä¶"
April 2018,Superb Experience,"From entering to leaving, it was a superb experience, the staff were extremely helpful and the room in great condition.  We could not have happasked for more.  The room itself was well sized and perfect for our occasion."
May 2018,Like being in the Kingsman movie!  A private entrance to an private club feel.,"The 41 is an eclectic blend of English library and private club. The staff is as pleasant and helpful as you can hope for in a hotel.  We had a 5 night stay with a quiet, bright and spacious room.  This 5th floor hotel is well appointed and tastefully decorated.  The tones for the room are white with black accents.  Maintaining an old English flair with modern amenities in lighting, gas fireplace, and marble bathroom.  The Executive lounge is a high ceiling library with several tables and couches well situated to provide private conversation but giving the opportunity to meet other guests if desired.  The breakfast service is excellent, either a continental buffet or ordered hot items from the menu.  Raiding the pantry in the evening became a regular habit along with a perfectly‚Ä¶"
March 2018,Delightful Stay/Exquisite service,"Trip to Ireland was canceled at last second because of bad weather, and we needed a hotel at the last second since we were staying in London. Had read about Hotel 41, decided to give it a try,  and was not dissapointed! From the arrival thru checkin we felt like we were family - the room was a 2 floor suite, with old world touches. Each night the beds were warmed with a hot water bottle! One of my travel companions commented on checkin about the name badges, and within an hour one was custom made and delivered to his room. This is the type of personal service that they offered. It was nice to be recognized and greeted by name each time.  One of the highlights was the Executive lounge where you checked in, with complimentary champagne. It was also always open. We had a delightful‚Ä¶"
May 2018,Wonderful and outstanding Hotel,"We recently stayed at Hotel No 41 for our wedding anniversary. Everything was perfect from our greeting by Max at the front door, to our welcome champagne on check in. The suite was beautifully decorated, the bedroomwas on a mezzanine level and was well equipped. All the staff worked seemlessly to ensure each customer recieved impeccable customer service and strived to maintain high standards. Thankyou for making our stay very special and very enjoyable."
April 2018,Luxury hotel ,I enjoyed my stay over here with my family. City Centric so easy to reach other famous locations easily.  Nice ambiance.  Friendly service.  Easy to locate.  Free wifi. Hygiene room. Thank you management. 
April 2018,Great hotel!,"The service here is impeccable, although a little too personal for my taste. The breakfast was fresh and flawless, we never had a better breakfast in our lives! The rooms were great, the beds were very comfortable. The rooms were a litlle small and a bit chilly (heating was not working). Toilets were not flushing properly. But all in all a great stay."
November 2017,"Best hotel service, ever.","Physically, this hotel is an ordinary, somewhat dated, small luxury hotel. But the service is absolutely incredible. Better than the best in the world (Connaught/Claridge's/etc.).. Just one tiny example: during turndown service, they carefully tidied the dangling cords on my phone chargers with little Velcro cable wraps. Who DOES that? Just stellar."
June 2017,Fun Hotel in the London Area,"I traveled to London and stayed at the Hotel 41 during the summer time, it was beautiful and filled with amazing character.  The most incredible think about the hotel is it's historical charm and attention to detail."
April 2018,"Service, Service, Service","This is an incredibly nice hotel so you expect the room to be comfortable and clean, you expect a decent lounge, newspapers, coffee, tea, etc. I read about the service in other reviews, but until we stayed here it was hard to understand what a difference that can make on an international trip.  For someone who is used to taking care of everything this was actually a little difficult to get used to, for the first hour...... we asked about getting tickets to the Churchill War Room, sure they will be down in the lobby in a few minutes.  Great, that was easy, we walked up to the area and saw a very long line, no worries, we showed the paperwork to the gentleman directing people and he escorted us to the front of the line and let us in right away, wow didn‚Äôt expect that!! Dinner‚Ä¶"
March 2018,Whatever/Whenever,"Whatever/Whenever is more than just a label on the top button of the 41's room phones.  It is a philosophy that permeates their service culture.  I could write volumes on their impeccable attention to detail, their almost clairvoyant anticipation of your needs, and that mesmerizing aroma that perfumes the halls of the 41 with a woodsy cleanliness that's difficult to put in words.  Instead I'll share my experience where once again action speaks louder than words.  On a recent trip to London, my wife realized she had forgotten to pack our portable steam iron--an indispensable item for our upcoming cruise.  I pressed the W/W button to see if I could get some help finding a place where I could purchase one in London before our cruise the next day.  Meanwhile we went sightseeing‚Ä¶"
April 2018,Simply the Best,"In the words of Tina Turner, whose World Premiere Musical, ‚ÄòTina,‚Äô  we were lucky enough to see in London....Hotel 41 is ‚ÄòSimply the Best‚Äô. The level of concierge service is above & beyond all expectations. It is rare that I remember the names of Hotel management but from Victoria & Nicole who I initially made contact with to Max & especially David,....I grew fond of them all. David was funny, completely authentic, knew lots about London, traveling & being adventurous. Before booking I thought the hotel might be a bit too formal for my taste but all involved Hotel 41 are very down to earth. They seemed genuinely interested in us as artists & made suggestions based on that.  The ‚Äò Executive Lounge‚Äô is on the same floor (level 5) as the rooms. Both Hotel 41 and the Lounge have a‚Ä¶"
May 2017,One of the very best in the world,"Having stayed at various top-end hotels and read the raving reviews, my expectations were very high. And they were exceeded with grace and without hesitation. This is a very special place where it's all about the guest. I've come back several times and the staff never failed to deliver against the standards they set the first time. Don't tell anyone about this place so it can stay one of the best-kept secrets of London."
April 2018,Excellent Hotel for a Stay in London,"I would have to say this is one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed at.  The level of service provided by the staff is top notch and the facilities, food and level of customer care is unrivalled.  If you want to treat yourself book and stay here.  As an added benefit, the location in London is excellent for access to Victoria station and most of the attractions the City has to offer."
April 2018,A dream. ,"I‚Äôve stayed in many a London hotel and I have to say that Hotel 41 is my favourite. Although pricey, you definitely get what you pay for and I had an amazing weekend alone, from the kids here. May make a habit of it! "
November 2017,World class service,We travel a lot & this hotel has never failed to impress us with its outstanding service.  Sharing a recent experience- The staff were exceptionally courteous & helpful. Even the smallest requirements of each & every guests were taken care of which is really commendable.  I strongly recommend this hotel.
January 2018,Attention to the details ,"Superb service and a beautiful setting! Staff are quick to engage you in conversation, make suggestions and provide helpful tips, and make you feel welcome. I was always greeted by name and the staff took the time to learn more about my interests and my plans. I enjoyed the many personal touches...for example, after seeing a musical that I had mentioned in conversation earlier, I returned to my room that evening to find some small treats in connection to that same musical. The setting is lovely, presenting a cozy, yet classic feel. I stayed in an Executive Suite, which did not disappoint. Classic black and white styling with personal touches. Excellent location...within walking distance of many museums, theatres, restaurants, and Buckingham Palace. Also easy to access many‚Ä¶"
January 2018,Best of London,"My husband and I met our adult daughter in London for a few days of sight-seeing and to enjoy the city. Hotel 41 was our favorite part of the trip! We felt like we were the only ones staying there (even though we weren‚Äôt), the staff was so attentive, welcoming, and thoughtful. The breakfast in the lounge was delicious and fresh. A true taste of Britain with an exquisitely set table near the cozy fireplace.  They welcomed us at every turn, offering to help us with directions, recommendations, and even welcomed us with champagne!  We were here for our 30th wedding anniversary, and we are already looking forward to returning. This is the place we want to stay every time we visit London. Thank you to all who made us feel so welcomed! Our daughter had to leave for her flight at 3am,‚Ä¶"
January 2018,Wonderful experience,This Hotel is unbelievable. The Staff are exceptional and the facilities are second to none. We booked for my Wife's birthday and when we arrived in the room we had a selection of treats and a birthday cake. The executive lounge is a real winner but the staff really make the difference. This will now be our home from home when we visit London.
April 2017,Simply Wonderful,It has been a while since I have stayed at the Hotel 41 but it was a great experience.  The service and facilities are first class in all respects.  It was a great place for a business meeting.  The service provided to my invited meeting guest was perfect. 
January 2018,"Lovely service, we will be back","We had a very short stay here and it was as we expected from the other reviews. Staff very attentive and nothing too much trouble.  Despite the central location once you are upstairs and inside it is very quiet and we heard nothing in our room.   Lots of nice little touches abound like the complementary snacks, ice-cream and cheese in the evening. Turn down service folded our clothes and event tidied up charging cables. Breakfast was top notch.  We'll be back!"
January 2018,Birthday Weekend in London,Stayed in this fantastic hotel for my wife's birthday and had a the most memorable weekend.  I really believe that the key to 'Hotel 41's' success is that they manage to make you feel special from the moment you check in and are offered a glass of champagne till the moment you sadly have to leave.  We loved 'plunder the pantry' in the evening which I think is pretty unique all the way through to one of the best breakfasts we have ever had in the morning.  The service we received was exceptional with all staff being so friendly and personable and a huge thank you to the management team at Hotel 41 for the complimentary bottle of champagne left in our room which we enjoyed in front of the fire.
January 2018,I keep coming back!,"Never a disappointment, hotel 41 is the epitome of comfort, class and a top quality hotel with a lovely friendly atmosphere from the second you arrive with a glass of champers on check in and helpful, genuinely friendly staff and comfort at every turn. There‚Äôs the fabulous b bar cafe on one side of the hotel, with the best salt beef sandwich you‚Äôll ever taste- and on the other, the wonderful Ruebens at the palace (sister hotel) with the new ‚Äòcurry room‚Äô which serves the best currys along with superb cocktails, live music and wonderful service are the norm. You don‚Äôt need to travel very far to have a superb time and, like me, you‚Äôll keep coming back again and again üòä"
February 2017,"The most wonderful hidden gem, we are so glad to have found it and can't wait to return","The most wonderful hotel, a real hidden gem. My husband and I both agree 41 is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in in the world, and we have visited quite a few! From point of booking and arrival at the hotel, right through to departure we felt like the most important people in the world. The service at 41 is impeccable, as is the decor throughout, not to mention the stunning array of food in the 'pantry'. We were served complimentary hot cheese and ham sandwiches (over a glass of wine and a game or two of chess on the balcony!!) before we went to see our show, as we ran out of time to go somewhere for dinner, and this was a really lovely gesture by the hotel. After seeing a show in town we returned to the hotel and we able to 'plunder the pantry' which was simply put,‚Ä¶"
November 2017,So different....,This might be the best hotel that I have ever stayed in.Not only were the staff spot on but the vibe was like no other hotel I have been too. Upon coming to the reception area the service was like no other I have had
July 2017,incredible accomodation,"Luxury Hotel, incredible service, nice surrounding area and amazing staff. I am always happy to come here when I have to visit London, is such a great experience and it become better at any new stay. Ok it's expensive but it's really a great way to spend my money because everything it's excellent!!!!!!  I just love this place"
March 2018,Sheer perfection from arrival to departure ,"My husband and I have just recently returned from a one night stay here and it was perfect! We chose this hotel due to its outstanding reviews and boy, they weren‚Äôt wrong. The customer service shown to us by everyone we encountered at the hotel was second to none. From Nicole‚Äôs beaming smile with an offer of a freshly made hot chocolate when we arrived, to Max who showed us up to the Executive Lounge and the wonderfully kind Florent who checked us in, everyone was delightful and literally could not do enough to help us.   Aside from being wonderfully located near Victoria stations, this hotel happily goes the extra mile to make everything special for its guests. On arrival we were informed that we had been upgraded to the Balmoral Suite which was a most unexpected, but extremely‚Ä¶"
February 2018,Exquisite and so British !,"Everything was perfect, from the room to the people with all the little details that make your stay unforgetable. The hotel is very central (located nearby Victoria station) and 5mn by feet from Buckingham Palace."
December 2017,Best in class,"My wife and I stayed in London for 10 days to celebrate Christmas and her birthday. It was my job to pick the hotel. After extensive research, I picked Hotel 41. To say that this establishment is amazing would be a complete understatement. The most attentive, friendly, accommodating staff we have ever experienced. We stayed in a couple of different rooms(by choice) and they were terrific. I would like to give special attention to a few of the staff. Lukas, Adele and Florent who helped with the original reservation. Thank you Hotel 41 for such a wonderful experience "
February 2018,The best ever!,"Thank you everyone at 41 Hotel for making my stay just perfect. It‚Äòs a real home away from home - which welcomes you after a long day in the city. Besides the super friendly and relaxed staff, the evening turndown completed a perfect week in a perfect hotel. "
February 2018,Message to The Ritz Hotel - Please take notes...,"Reservation made via Expedia Room Type - Executive Room, 1 King Bed Breakfast included Room Number - 4106 Duration: 1 night (14th February 2018)  We experienced the magic that is Hotel 41 for the first time for one night as part of our honeymoon.    The welcome to the hotel can only be described as simply outstanding.  Lucas at the concierge desk was the first point of contact. Immaculately dressed, he welcomed us as if we were family members.  After taking our details, we explained we unfortunately missed our  Hard Rock Cafe reservation due to traffic delays.  He said he would contact Hard Rock to see if the reservation could be honoured despite being nearly 1 hour late.    We were taken to the Executive Lounge to officially check in.  As the reservation had already been‚Ä¶"
February 2018,Wow Memories that will last forever!,"Stayed here as treat for 40th birthday on febuary 20th and I have to say I really didn't want to go home! From the moment we arrived we knew this was a special place we were taken straight to the executive lounge and provided with a glass of champagne whilst checking in, the lounge was so relaxing and the staff were all amazing whilst there having a drink you are given snacks complementary as well as there being a complementary snack bar to help yourself and including icecreams! We were then shown to our room and I would personally like to thank hotel 41 for the upgrade to the suite which really made my birthday!!! It had everything you could possibly need and more! Even down to the little things like in the mini bar were the drinks we had in the bar! I would never in my dreams‚Ä¶"
February 2018,#1 Hotel in London and will make your trip amazing!!,"We love to visit London and stay at Hotel 41 each trip. I can honestly say that the people of Hotel 41 actually make our trips so much more special with their high attention to detail, friendly service, immaculate property and fun extras. There is nowhere else you should stay when visiting the city (it's top of 1000's of properties for a reason and has been for years).    We were in town for a combo business/ The Crown post binge watch tour. The property is across the street from Buckingham Palace and the Royal Mews. St James Park, the Churchill War Rooms, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, etc. are all within walking distance. We walked to almost everything we did and used our room as a hub. Shopping, drop off packages. Museums, stop by the lounge for a coffee and some cookies.‚Ä¶"
February 2018,Hotel 41,"Listed as a 5 star hotel and it is.  It would spoil the visit to say all they did for us.  This hotel is on the top floor of its sister (4 star) hotel.  There is a separate entrance and when you miss it you are meet with smiles to correct.  It is a hidden gem.  Lastly Buckingham palace is across the street, Victoria theater a block away where Hamilton is performing"
February 2018,If only real life could be like this...,"Third time lucky visiting the wonderful Hotel 41 and I can only really echo the same things that everyone else has said.   From the second you walk in the door, to the second you leave, you feel like you are part of an extended, well treated, pampered family.   Every single detail is thought of, from the moment you go to breakfast to the moment you go to bed.   I cannot recommend 41 enough to anyone.   My only problem is, it leaves you longing to go back!"
February 2018,Greatest surprise in Londkn,"First of all : this is a ‚Äú hotel boutique‚Äù Ok? Search for the concept  And one of the best I‚Äôve ever being   Room : very beautiful decoration  Localisatin:5 minut√µes from Victoria metro station, some new and modern restaurants in the same street, and Buckingham palace  10‚Äù walk from Big Ben, westminster Abbey, and the Parlament   Staff : young crew, very helpful, kindly treatment, make every day a good day at the breakfast , at the special ‚Äú lounge‚Äù   ‚Äúwhat make the city is the people , not the buildings ‚Äú 41 staff made that point !"
February 2018,Valentine Treat,"Having booked a surprise valentine trip for my wife, Hotel 41 made the experience all the more special. From the moment we walked into the foyer of the hotel, we were greeted by excellent and extremely helpful staff. Nothing was too much trouble throughout our stay and the romantic turndown service a lovely treat. We were recommended to this hotel by a friend, and we will certainly be recommending it.  Regards Hugh C"
February 2018,a very pleasant stay,"We stayed in the Hotel 41 from monday through thursday. It is a very comfortable place, where the staff tries to read your wishes from your eyes. We would always choose it again for a trip to London. The services include even the offer of complementary water when leaving the hotel for the day."
February 2018,Amazing Location and and even better Guest Services,"Absolutely impecable service, together with a great location. Prepare to be spoiled by wonderful staff that is ready to assist you in anything you might need. Naturally, this kind of service comes with proper pricing."
February 2018,41 London,Amazing hotel with the most amazing staff and service. Cozy rooms with lots of space. You feel special when you live there. It‚Äôs quiet but still there is a great vibe there. The lounge is absolutely perfect and cozy and the food is great- already looking forward to come back and say hello again to the wonderful staff that will take care of you 24/7. See you soon :)
February 2018,A Classic London atmosphere ,"This is not one of the typical hotel I would book for a London stay but booked it for some reasons as to closeness to station and so on. For being a five star hotel they do give you a full service from personnel to please, no complaints about this, but for us our idea of five star service is personel on alert but not on you all the time - but that‚Äôs us. Room was small but cozy. And needed one could go to the lounge to get soda or nibbling a or later on have a drink and cheese and others. Did have to call room service as the sheets were a bit stained and the warm water-bottle had broke in the bed. Hehe! Then in the service the forgot their phone ..  breakfast was really good and the offered gluten and lactose free alternatives. So been there and some that."
February 2018,Cozy and warm,I've stayed here twice and I loved it. The staff is super friendly and nice and made our stay perfect from the first minute until the last. I didn't complain about anything and that's very rare :-) the rooms are warm and cozy and I couldn't wait to fall into the bed at night. I would always come back!!! 
January 2018,Impressive not oppressive ,"Came for a weekend as a birthday treat, and was so impressed by the attention to detail at every level: the staff are incredibly helpful and welcoming, the rooms well decorated as per the whole hotel, the food delicious and some wonderful extra perks: free snacks, massive array for breakfast, personal touch down service (including little things like winding a USB lead up neatly, with a Velcro tie), plus offering a very tasteful and welcoming restaurant. This truly feels like an elegant town house vs. ‚ÄòJust another hotel‚Äô. It‚Äôs located right in the centre of London within a stones throw of main attractions, yet with the feeling you are cosily ensconced from the hectic frenzy of city life. Wow, we will be back!"
February 2018,London's No.1 Hotel for a reason!,"My wife and I have just returned from a short break at Hotel 41 and I can only describe this short break as amazing!!  From the minute we stepped into the entrance lobby we were treated like royalty!  The hotel is beautiful and very well maintained, our room was spotlessly clean and well serviced twice per day!  The staff could not do enough to make our visit extra special and the attention to detail was fabulous! The location could not be better and allowed us to walk most places we wanted to visit, however, coming back and sitting beside the cosy executive lounge fire on a cold February afternoon was fantastic! Well done to the team at Hotel 41, no question why it is London‚Äôs No.1 hotel!"
February 2018,Truly Fabulous,"Hotel 41 deserves the accolades it receives, everything about this beautiful boutique hotel is wonderful, from the welcome you get at the door, the drinks you're offered as you check in, the complimentary snacks, the ambience and the decor, the rooms and the en suites to the staff, all of whom are polite, helpful and clearly happy to go the extra mile, you are all credits to your organisation. The rose petals on the bed, the hot water bottles and the fireplaces in the rooms simply added to the feeling of luxury. We felt truly spoilt, thank you Hotel 41, we had the perfect night."
February 2018,fabulous,"Excellent hotel,   its not for everyone, if you want a busy hotel with a buzzy bar this is not for you, however if you want luxury, superb service great location and wonderful staff then you will love it. we could not fault anything highly recommend."
January 2018,Private Club Feel in Heart of London ,"The customer service is outstanding! Everyone that works there is smiling and friendly & you feel like they truly want to help you with anything you need.  I won‚Äôt stay anywhere else in London ever again other than Hotel 41.  From the customer service, to the quality of the food, to the comfort of your room....all 5 stars!!!"
December 2017,"Great hotel, excellent service ","We stayed in Hotel 41 for a week from Boxing Day until the first of January. From the moment we arrived we were amazed by the excellent service. The moment you check in the staff know you by name, they remember about everything you tell. We went to a show and the day after one of the staff asked us about the show.  In the lounge there are always some snacks (completely) and you can order about any drink you can think of. I was getting a bit ill during my stay (I catched a cold) and one of the staff told me I should drink a Toddy. Didn‚Äôt know what that was but see got one from me and it did help. The next few days several members of the staff asked me how I was doing.   We‚Äôve stayed in several 5 star hotels but you can‚Äôt compare hotel 41 with any of these. Hotel 41 is a 5 star‚Ä¶"
December 2017,The Perfect Hotel,We were going to London for our honeymoon and decided to stay at Hotel 41 after seeing its high rating and great reviews.  The hotel and staff surpassed our expectations. The staff surprised us with a congratulations cake in our room. The room was spacious and comfortable and we looked forward to the nightly turn down service (loved the hot water bottle). The lounge was a great place to relax after spending a day sightseeing. We enjoyed the food and goodies from the Pantry. The staff were exceptional; very friendly and helpful.  The location of the hotel could not be better. Lots of great restaurants nearby and it was easy to travel all over London. We would never be able to stay anywhere else if in London and we're already planning a trip back.
November 2017,Ultimate Service,"The hotel was warm and welcoming and was an ideal home base for our time in London.  The room was a bit smaller than we expected, but what the room lacked in size, the staff made up for with their impeccable service.  The staff was extremely attentive and was happy to help with any request.  In fact, they even followed up with a special request after we checked out!  The hotel is well located, within walking distance to the train/metro station and many of the top sites in London.  Each evening, after a long day of sightseeing, we looked forward to the varied and delicious Plunder the Pantry offerings in the cozy lounge."
December 2017,Industry Excellence!,"The staff is remarkable. The property is exquisite. The location is unbelievable. From a Christmas tree in our room, stocking on our door and present under the tree, they made my daughter‚Äôs Christmas in London unforgettable. Thank you 41 Hotel"
November 2017,What a treat,This hotel is located directly across the street from Buckingham Palace and close to the tube.  My husband and I stayed here for three nights and were blown away by the service/cleanliness and attention to detail from this hotel. You are greeted at the front door and escorted up to a wonderful lounge area where you are given a glass of bubbly (really good) and olives while you get relaxed and checked into your room.  The room we were in was wonderful clean and by English standards quite roomy.  To my surprise on the first evening there was a water bottle in my bead which was a nice added touch to our stay and upon arrival there after it heated my bed before I retired to it lol.  Morning breakfast was included and it was yummy - I am a coffee snob and there coffee was good!!!!  I‚Ä¶
December 2017,Still amazing,"Our second stay at 41 was every bit as magical as the first. Perhaps helped, just a little, by the surprise upgrade to the wonderful Conservatory Suite (what an amazing treat - thank you!). Plunder the pantry food was varied and delicious, as were the canapes which accompanied our cocktails.  It was great to see some familiar faces, and a few new members of the team, all delivering the trademark service for which 41 is renowned. So tough to drag ourselves away from the lounge and back to the real world, but we're already planning our next visit."
July 2017,Top Hotel,This hotel is top notch. From the time you check in to your departure the staff makes you feel like royalty. The hotel is also in a great location. As an added bonus the ‚Äúsnacks‚Äù that are put out towards evening out are unbelievable. One night after a long day we had wine and the snacks it was a perfect end to the day. Keep up the excellent job.
December 2017,Once in a lifetime,There are no words to describe the experience of staying here. 7 stars.  Tucked away above the Reubens hotel you would never know that this luxurious hotel is there. Extraordinarily attentive staff with fantastic attention to detail. Food was wonderful.
November 2017,Small and Perfect!,"Great little London hotel! Staff was very helpful with our various needs (from arriving early to transportation) and we really enjoyed our stay. This hotel excels at all the little unexpected things, like leaving a hot water bottle in your bed at turndown, along with other treats like pillow spray or lip balm. The location is perfection, right across from Buckingham Palace and close to the Victoria tube and train station, so you can get to everywhere you need. The snack pantry was one of my favorite parts (all hotels should do this) and it was nice being able to grab a quick snack whenever you wanted! Rooms and bathrooms were well-appointed and quite spacious as well. I'd definitely return!"
January 2018,New Year Celebration,Recently returned from seeing in the New Year at 41 Hotel and they certainly do it in a style that befits the hotel. It is difficult to beat a Glass of Champagne for toasting the New Year and a Piper to pipe in the New Year. It was our second visit and it certainly lives up to all the reviews. It is like coming back to your favourite place where they welcome you with open arms and a glass of champagne. The button - WhateverWhenever - on the telephone in your room is an indication of the level of service they pride themselves in. It is answered very quickly. Can‚Äôt wait for our next visit.  
September 2017,Cozy place,Small room but cozy. The hotel staff are some of the best I've experienced around the world. It is across from Buckingham Palace and if you're looking for a boutique 5 star experience I would recommend this hotel.
December 2017,"Quaint, Cozy, Excellent!","The service here is amazing, most attentive staff I have experienced in a hotel.  The vibe is like a private club.  When you access the property it is past a reception desk to an elevator.  When you get tot hotel, it occupies one floor.  In the center there is a lounge featuring drinks and food all day.  Fireplaces, cozy sofas and intimate tables.  If you want to people watch and mingle in a bigger hotel environment, you can go next door to the Rubens Hotel. Larger, more impersonal, however still lovely!  I had several drinks at the bar there and listened to live music. My room was well appointed, comfortable bed, deluxe sheets, top of the line toiletries, fantastic turn down service treats! Hot water bottle in bed every night was a great after a cold day in the city! I will‚Ä¶"
December 2017,Another fabulous stay,"We stayed here just after our wedding in 2015 and decided to return for our anniversary. Right from the moment I booked we were treated like celebrities.   The staff here know how to be present, without being in your face and the whole operation is incredibly slick. There are so many hotels I've been to which should take some advice from the Hotel 41.  The food choice from breakfast through to ""plunder the pantry"" is extremely generous and we didn't need to eat out as we were so full. The wine and cocktail list is equally good. We tried a bottle of Hannibal from their sister winery in South Africa and it was seriously good.  The Hotel and its staff stand out as there are an abundance of extra touches here. I don't want to spoil the surprise for you so I'll just list a few things‚Ä¶"
January 2018,Perfection,"This was my first time to visit this beautiful hotel and it deserves 6 stars for the perfect service warm and friendly too perfection. The reception and lobby are so beautiful you don't want to leave. It transports you to another place in time. The rooms are so pretty, with fire places and wonderful bedding.  The service is impeccable. Everyone you meet is charming and have a wealth of knowledge and they all want to be of service.  Ivo and Laura were so helpful to me as was Victoria the concierge, Aaron the doorman and Laura the GM and her staff...just lovely people who continue to earn important awards that they truly deserve."
December 2017,Christmas in London,"Six of us stayed at this lovely boutique hotel just a few blocks from Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station.  The property is very elegant but homey. You are made to feel as an honored guest in someone‚Äôs home.  Perfect for Christmas morning. The staff is friendly and attentive. The complimentary ‚ÄúPlunder The Pantry‚Äù service provides high quality snacks throughout the day, including a light evening buffet.  The Guest Services staff are excellent at making dinner, entertainment and tour arrangements. Individual kindnesses shown by staff members were also much appreciated.  I have never had a better hotel experience."
January 2018,Perfect as always,This was our 4th stay at Hotel 41 and it is always perfect. There is no other way to describe it. The staff are amazing and nothing is ever too much trouble. It is a peaceful and relaxing retreat in the centre of London. Can't wait to return for Christmas 2018. 
December 2017,As good or better than expected,Stayed here 12/26/17 - 12/31/17.  Could not have asked for better service and a better experience up and down their team.  Special shout out to Nicole who was just outstanding in her service but then again so was EVERYONE else only wish I jotted everyone's name down.   The location is awesome and easy to walk to all over London or a short walk to the Victoria Tube stop. I can't wait to return and would not think of staying anywhere else in London.  We had a large room particularly for a European city which was very comfortable. Thank you !
December 2017,Service beyond comparison...,"Although not returning to stay this time, I had been in touch to ask a favour for my Partners Christmas present.  Not something I was sure they could do, but I decided to ask anyway.  I initially contacted Malcolm, the General Manager, with my request.  He responded positively and gave me the relevant detail I needed to make my choices, which I did.  I arranged to pick up and reimburse them for my Partners Christmas present on Christmas Eve (which they had arranged), and was greeted by name, offered a hot chocolate drink on arrival (it was cold and windy outside) and asked to go to the reception desk upstairs.  Again, greeted by the team by name and the present was brought through.  I expected the present in a 41 bag or similar but was flabbergasted to find the present had been‚Ä¶"
December 2017,Benchmark of class,"Our 4th visit to Hotel 41 in as many years and it absolutely isn‚Äôt an exaggeration to say that each visit has got better and better. Our last visit was to celebrate our 10th anniversary and the kindness and standard of customer service that we were shown made it something that will live long in our memories. Hotel 41 remains the benchmark against which we measure service at other hotels, which explains why we are currently planing our 5th visit."
November 2017,Amazing service and great location!,"This was our first time to London and we weren't sure where to go or stay but trusted that this hotel got such great reviews on TripAdvisor. Let me just say we weren't disappointed. The hotel is in a fabulous location, close to Buckingham Palace, Victoria Station, and tons of other easy to walk to landmarks. I have to say, our expectations were exceeded by our stay. The staff was so friendly and welcoming, and eager to make our experience incredible. Nicole provided us with great recommendations for dinner and entertainment and we enjoyed everything she suggested. The rest of the staff knew our names and made us feel right at home. The housekeeping was amazing! There were so many little touches like cord keepers, and sheet warmers, and everyday they made sure our room was‚Ä¶"
November 2017,Luxury in a personal way,"A 3-night stay that was perfect. The service is excellent still on a very personal way. You really feel welcome and welcomed in this hotel. I have been in London several times, but this was without question the best hotelstay I have had in this city."
April 2017,Luxurious and Welcoming,Hotel 41 is beautiful and they have thought of everything you might need.  The beds are extremely comfortable.  The rooms are stunning.  The food is delicious.  The service is impeccable yet friendly.  We stayed for five nights and every time we came back to the hotel we were welcomed by name and asked about our day and it felt like we were home.  Location is also great (just down the road from her maj).
November 2017,Fantastic service and building ,"Stayed here for 2 nights and the staff were amazingly accommodating- nothing too much trouble. They booked my friend and I into a hair salon last minute, recommended restaurants and were truly fantastic. The best location to tourist attractions and the most comfy bed. "
November 2017,A little hidden gem in London.....,"I booked Hotel 41 as a surprise weekend away to treat my Wife for her 40th Birthday. We were greeted with a glass of complementary champagne and the experience just got better as the weekend continued. The staff just couldn't do enough for us, and it made for such an enjoyable stay.  The room was spacious and well equipped with everything that you could need for your stay. In the evening, we were up against the clock in getting ready to go for dinner at the Roux at the Landau and the room was left in a bit of a mess when we left. However when we returned, the fire was on, candles lit with rose petals around the bed, background music playing and the everything in the room has been tidied (clothes folded and hung up, toiletries arranged neatly in the bathroom) and there was even a‚Ä¶"
August 2017,Fantastic Hotel!,"Stayed here for our 2 year Anniversary back in August and had a fantastic stay. From the minute you walk in you are treated like royalty. Staff are very polite and well trained. We really enjoyed the welcome champagne from the trolley, very nice touch! The room was beautifully decorated with extremely comfortable beds. Had a few Brandies in the bar when we got back from the show and was again, very well looked after. I have stayed in several of the top Hotels in London (The Dorchester, Savoy, Shangri La, Mandarin Oriental etc) and I can honestly say, Hotel 41 is one of the best and has a lovely personal touch, which can get lost at other larger Hotels. I'd recommend it without hesitation."
October 2017,Great Hotel,"41 is most definitely the best hotel in the city! Everything is 5 star - location, accommodation, attitude. But what really makes this hotel superb is the Staff. All the crew members are real hospitality stars - attentive to every detail, responsive, cordial, helpful. Thanks a lot, people of Hotel 41!"
October 2017,Executive suite and lux from start to end,"The service is without peer. The fireplace in the executive lounge warmed me as I drank champagne and nibbled delicious canap√©s. Our tastefully decorated bedroom had either a 16 or 18 foot ceiling and the lighting was easily adjustable to provide anywhere from single reading to brilliant room light.  A pillow spray, complimentary bedroom slippers (new), and the offer of a complimentary shoe shine all enhanced the experience and in-room spa options are available.  It is across the street from Buckingham Palace and gift shop.  We opted to dine at the pub at the corner, the Bag of Nails, and then enjoyed a restful good night sleep before returning to the USA."
October 2017,Excellent hotel that will spoil you for anywhere else,"We stared here for 4 nights in October.  I can't rave about this hotel enough, it was everything I expected and more - and I tend to expect quite a bit.  Room had those extra special touches - welcome note and chocolates, towel warmer in bathroom, robe and slippers, hot water bottle in bed each night, turn-down service with different surprises.  The staff were truly exceptional - quickly learned our names and preferences.  This hotel pampers you beyond belief without giving off a feeling of pretentiousness - we cannot imagine staying anywhere else in London.  Thanks to everyone who helped to make our stay special."
September 2017,Beautiful and Unique Small Hotel,"We absolutely loved Hotel 41 and would stay there again if we ever are lucky enough to go back to London!  Every staff member is so personable, and they go above and beyond to take exceptional care of you!  We stayed in an executive King room and it was just lovely!  The decor throughout the hotel was gorgeous. We loved being able to go through a door on the hotel side and access The Reuben Hotel next door for dining options and a bar.  We paid for a full breakfast every morning and the food was delicious!  One of the staff members heard we were going on a diet when we returned to the states, and when we got back to our room one day during our stay, there were candies, cookies, and sweets on the table with a little note saying that they hope we could enjoy these before our‚Ä¶"
August 2017,The only place i will stay in London,Undoubtedly one of the best hotels in the world in terms of exclusivity and exquisite treatment to customers. The details that make the stay unforgettable are innumerable. For a London feeling this is the place!
September 2017,Always wonderful,"Hotel 41 is a home away from home, and we love staying here. Book as far in advance as possible as it is very popular. We worry about writing a review in case we can't get in next time we're in London - we certainly wouldn't stay anywhere else given a choice. Customer satisfaction is their top priority, and they always succeed."
August 2017,Our second stay - just as awesome as our first!,"otel 41  London  520468664  We stayed here about 3 years ago and loved it so much we gave friends a voucher as a birthday gift. When they couldn't use it, they returned the voucher to us and off we went back to Hotel 41. Staying here is a truly a classically enjoyable experience in what great service ought to be. A small hotel occupying one floor of a building, they have a handful of rooms and a large staff so they can offer really exceptional service. I felt as if there was no ""nickle and diming"" you - snacks and beverages are available all day in the Executive Lounge where you can enjoy a great buffet breakfast. At night, they offer turndown service and will tidy up the room again and provide fresh towels. They place bottled water each evening by the bed. We loved being able‚Ä¶"
September 2017,Superb,"I've stayed in 5 star hotels around the world, and one question I ponder is, ""what makes a luxury hotel different?""  I think it could be how comfortable and welcome they make you feel as a guest.   Here are some ways Hotel 41 does that: 1. Staff is waiting in the lobby to escort you to check in. You are offered a cold (or warm) drink, and taken care of immediately. 2. A personal note welcoming you is waiting in your charming room. 3. Among other things in the room: the remote control is in a baggie (they've sanitized it!), water waiting by the bed, a candle lit in the bathroom, heated towel racks--honestly, anything you could think of, it's there. And if it's not? They will get it for you. I needed a curling iron with a UK plug. I had it in less than 5 minutes. 4. The staff all‚Ä¶"
September 2017,What's The Difference That Makes The Difference?,"Rather than wax lyrical about the superb furnishing of the hotel, the perfect location and the unparalleled quality of customer care and service, and rather than replicate the many fine words of praise set down by others, I thought I'd try to highlight what for me, makes staying at Hotel 41 so special.    As with my stays at all other hotels, I plugged my phone into the charger overnight, and took it with me on my walks about town the following day.  On my return I found the lead had been neatly coiled, and a piece of Velcro helpfully attached to keep it that way.  (Please see photo).  I know it's only my opinion but for me, this is a perfect example of what the whole Hotel 41 experience is about - the efforts made by a team of people to anticipate my needs and satisfy them‚Ä¶"
August 2017,Customer Service x 1000.,"As the hotel management intern from Portugal said, ""This hotel takes customer service to a new level. There is not better place I could learn."" From the moment we arrived, we felt like we were being waited on hand and foot. We needed a bathroom in which to change after arriving from an overnight flight...We were given a room! We then came back from a tour and could hardly stay awake after being up 24 hours 9( bad flight). It was not yet check-in time. They gave us a room in which to take a nap! Look at the photos and see what they offer, but you cannot see from words or photos what extraordinary customer service they provide. Other things we loved: We were within walking distance from Buckingham Palace-across from the Mews. Wonderful, safe location near lots of restaurants.‚Ä¶"
December 2016,Bliss,"I happened to stumble upon this hotel by accident but am I glad I did! We have our annual '41' stay each year leading up to Christmas and I look forward to it all year. We have stayed in rooms and suites and can honestly say that it is top class. Nothing is too much trouble. Guests are treated like royalty and the staff go out if their way to make sure your stay is special. From the complimentary champagne on arrival to the little treats they leave in your room, so far we have had a birthday cake, basket of fruit, wine and a signed photo from the cast of wicked when we went to see it a couple if years ago. We love the executive lounge and the honesty bar and last time, we were sent home with a goodie bag for the train journey home! Please don't change anything, you are perfect!‚Ä¶"
August 2017,Details are priority,This hotel goes above and beyond for all guests. The vibe of just checking in the hotel is a vintage royal English welcoming with a glass of Champagne and some chocolates waiting in your room. I was impressed by the towel warming racks in the restroom. They basically do everything they can to make you feel at home. I stayed in a Executive King room which was perfect for 2 people. If you have a lot of luggage you might have to think about upgrading. We had room service on both nights we stayed because most pubs in the area closed at 11. Thank you to the staff  that went above and beyond while we stayed there.
August 2017,Perfect experience!,"My daughter and I vacationed here for several days.  The hotel is gorgeous, but what made it an exceptional experience was the efficiency, kindness and friendliness of the staff!  The afternoon tea is not to be missed.  The presentation was lovely and the treats delicious.  In addition, their ""plunder the pantry"" is a generous and thoughtful way to welcome travelers weary from a long journey.  The little extras such as the turndown service in the evening also made for a perfect vacation.  Very memorable!"
August 2017,exceptionalpersonalized service,"The warm and friendly  staff delivered exceptional service, They realized my daughter was entering university shortly and provided her a surprise congratulatory decorated cake!  Small details were all looked after and their timing for fulfilling any request was outstanding. They were engaging without any feeling of being overbearing."
July 2017,My new favorite hotel,"We have stayed at hotels all over the world.  We prefer somewhat quirky boutique hotels and 41 Hotel fits that description perfectly.  The location is marvelous (just across the street from Buckingham Palace).  Our ""Junior Suite"" had a sitting room with fireplace and a flight of stairs up to a space with a desk and a good size bedroom and bathroom.  The furnishings and decor were lovely.  The room was immaculate.  Most important, the staff is absolutely wonderful.  We were known by name within minutes of our arrival.  There is food available in a large common room 24 hours a day.  Late buffet dinners there (included in the tariff) were delicious and perfect for jet lagged travelers (us) who returned late from theatre on several nights.  The entire staff went out of their ways to‚Ä¶"
July 2017,Impeccable Boutique Hotel in the Heart of London,"My wife and I celebrated our 10th anniversary in London. We chose Hotel 41 based on the many fantastic reviews on Trip Advisor. We were treated to impeccable service by all the staff from the moment we arrived to our departure. The staff is courteous, helpful, friendly, with a mixture of flair and British reserve. Our room was perfect, with a very comfortable bed, plenty of drawer and closet space. The bathroom had a bathtub/shower combination as well as a separate shower. Excellent water pressure and plenty of hot water for a long shower after a day of sightseeing. There is a lovely main sitting room which also doubles as a breakfast area, afternoon tea, dinner and late snack. The wait staff is attentive and caters to your requests. The hotel is perfectly situated with‚Ä¶"
August 2017,A secret hideaway right in the middle of bustling London‚Ä¶,"...that also happens to be the #1 hotel in the entire city (out of thousands of options).  We just returned from our third stay at Hotel 41 and were more impressed than ever.  While they‚Äôve been #1 for years, it seems that they are actually getting better each stay.  They have somehow perfected the art of making a hotel feel like your home - that is, if your home is extremely posh and manned by the most helpful and friendly staff to be found.  The service is unmatched and well deserving of the five-star rating.  Perhaps most importantly, this is all delivered without any trace of pretension.  This is a place you can feel truly comfortable on your vacation.  We were only in town for two nights and had a lot packed into our schedule.  The staff arranged two cars, loaned us a temp‚Ä¶"
July 2017,Dropped in for tea,"Actually just dropped in for tea here as a bit out of my budget, but couldn't resist and pushed the holiday budget to be able to stay one night! It was perfect, and don't regret going there for a second. highly recommend"
May 2017,Pure luxury!- All that we had dreamed of and more! üíó,"We celebrated our 20th anniversary with our first trip to the UK in May. Hotel 41 was our home base for a weeklong packed trip which included long day excursion trips in England and Wales, every single day. This resulted in us not seeing much of London as planned our first day, due to a delayed flight. When staff learned that we were unable to see much in London, they presented us with a lovely book about London which was very sweet! The pampering we received when we returned every evening was so nice!  The bedding is extremely comfortable which was very important to me. The room was appointed beautifully, and treats were always left for us upon our return. The delicious after 7 ""plunder the pantry"" was a lifesaver for us as we were too exhausted for anything else. Anything you‚Ä¶"
August 2017,The BEST of the BEST!,"We chose  Hotel 41 for our stay in London based on all of the wonderful reviews.  This hotel was absolutely over the top with the most outstanding service we have ever received.  From the wonderful Check-In reception to the consummate host of the dining room, we were made to feel so at home and extra special. The public rooms of the dining and bar area are so inviting and our observatory guest room was such a great surprise.  Thank you to the management and each outstanding employee for making this hotel so outstanding and our stay so exceptional.  We will definitely be using Hotel 41 when our travels take us to London!!!!!! Thank you, Rick Fisher  Miami"
August 2017,Brilliant hotel - staff excellent,"So we took a punt, our usual and regular hotel in the vicinity had no rooms so we had to find another.  When you arrive don't miss the entrance between Bbar and the Rubens Hotel, but if you do err, then the staff at the Rubens will redirect you.  Once inside you are presented with a well appointed wood panelled corridor and a concierge desk.  The concierge will call up to get you escorted to the 5th floor, you will be treated by a polite and knowledgeable member of staff who tells you ""all the magic happens on the 5th floor"", and it really does.    it is all a little mysterious on first encounter, but all will become familiar quickly  You are escorted to the lounge which is also home to reception, where you are offered complementary champagne from a range of four on offer.

August 2017,Hotel 41,"Hotel name is very nice 41 and my lucky number was there so like name and aslonthey provide better service than most other hotel there so I like prefer to say please go there and yourself, and they give 5 rating out of 5.."
August 2017,Outstanding! Possibly the best place I have ever stayed. Easily top 2.,"The service here is already well documented (and deservedly so because it is out of this world) so I'll just get right to the second best highlight of our stay. We almost didn't book the 41 because of what looks to be missing. No bar, no restaurant, no meeting space. Luckily we let the location (across from the Royal Mews) and the reviews override our initial thoughts and booked anyway. There is NOTHING missing here. The lounge at the center of the hotel is a chameleon or transformer of a room that turns into whatever you need when you need it. Great bar, tea room, breakfast area, lunch/snacks, place to meet, whatever you want it to be it is. I know I said I wasn't going to rehash the service but....THE SERVICE!!!! Just incredible. So welcoming, so accommodating, so friendly. It‚Ä¶"
August 2017,Mini break ,"Hotel 41 is an amazing place - champagne on arrival, nibbles all through the day & fantastic service from all the staff. Best hotel in London in our opinion. We were treated to a romantic turn down on the first night - rose petals & dimmed lighting !  "
August 2017,Best staff on the planet!,"How many hotels can you say honestly get to know you personally.  This hotel has simply the best service bar none.  The staff looks to take care of absolutely anything you need at anytime of day, without making you feel uncomfortable or stuffy in any way.  Perfect staff for a perfect hotel!  Love staying here every time we travel to London."
July 2017,Gf and I loved it!,"Second time coming to London and absolutely loved this hotel.Very romantic and loved taking pictures of my girl in the hotel. Its also a good place to get transportation around if you did not rent a car. Loved exploring. Great service, thank you for everything guys!"
May 2017,Excellent..... as usual!,"Have stayed at Hotel 41 on numerous occasions. Always very good with polite and attentive staff.   When you check in you are served with a complimentary glass of Champagne which is a very nice touch.  The rooms are clean, tidy and decorated to a high standard.   The breakfast menu is extensive and extremely tasty.  Love the hotel and will go back again."
July 2017,Back again ,What can i say about this hotel every time I come to London I have to stay in this hotel it's very clean and the service is the best I strongly recommend this hotel to everyone thanks for everything guys 
July 2017,New Favorite Hotel - EVER!,"We were upgraded to this hotel from the Rubens at the Palace and simply LOVED every minute.  We stayed for 3 nights, but would have been happy with more!  Perfect location directly across from Buckingham Palace.  This was a retirement gift for my husband and everything was perfect - no complaints only compliments!  The staff (to include Florent, Stefan, Victoria, Mitchell, Paula and all others) made this a truly memorable stay.  Incredibly attentive and courteous to every guest and every request.  I am a travel agent and will be sending my clients here!"
September 2016,I love everything about this hotel,"I have been meaning to write this review since January 2016. The date drop down doesn't allow me to go that far back so Ive put Sept 2016 as thats as far back as I can go. My husband and I have been here twice now and there is nowhere else we'd rather stay when in London.  The staff are just wonderful, so polite and attentive without being overly so. The rooms are luxurious and spacious and both times we have been they have upgraded us for no extra charge. The second time we visited (January 2016) my husband had planned a surprise trip to New York. I was under the impression we were having a two night stay at Hotel 41 but he had arranged for just the one night but had been in contact with the hotel to make sure the kept up pretences that we were actually there for two nights.‚Ä¶"
July 2017,#1 for a reason,"The hotel is amazing and goes above and beyond any request you can imagine. It's beautiful, in a great location, and the staff sincerely wants to make your stay amazing. We stayed for 1 night for my birthday, and it was the most luxurious hotel I've ever stayed in. Be prepared for being treated like a celebrity."
July 2017,Hotel 41 Extraordinary,"When we read that Hotel 41 was voted the best hotel in London, it filled us with a mix of excitement and a bit of dread that it could not match the hype. Well, it does and goes beyond. From the choice of 4 champagnes when we arrived to the the solicitous attention to our needs and requests, Hotel 41 is unmatched. The staff is especially attentive and they seemed to genuinely care about us and our experiences. The ""plunder the pantry"" is truly a wonderful way to end a day sightseeing in London. I have already recommended the Hotel 41 to a few of my colleagues and friends."
July 2017,Two visits a week apart,"My husband, son and I had two fabulous experiences this month at Hotel 41.  We stayed three nights before heading to other destinations and then returned for another three nights before flying home.  The staff went way above and beyond any hotel we have ever stayed.  Our room (both times) was a 2-level suite which was perfect for our small family. The sofa-bed on the first level accommodated our son while we enjoyed a king-size bed on the second level.   We really enjoyed the lounge and the hotel location!  We highly recommend Hotel 41!"
July 2017,#1 for a Reason,"We had the good fortune to stay at the 41 for 4 days last month. Our visit was nothing short of spectacular. The hotel feels like a luxury private residence with impeccable service and over the top service. A shout out to Magdalene,Andrew,Steve(a history buff like me) and Lauren(for the amazing upgrade on our last night). Its been almost  3 weeks since we've been home and we're still talking about the service details that separate the 41 from any previous hotel. 5 stars is in insult to this property...we are already making plans to come back. Bravo 41!!!"
August 2017,A Wonderful Oasis,"My wife and I stayed here for our 30th wedding anniversary and were extremely impressed. From the moment we arrived, we felt genuinely welcome. And of course, it is the staff that make or break a hotel, and they were all excellent. The pink champagne on arrival, the special cake in our room, were lovely touches. The Executive Lounge, which is in the style of a Gentleman's Club, was a great place to relax, and to have breakfast. It truly is an oasis of calm in Central London. Number 1 for a reason, and thoroughly recommended."
August 2017,We Have a New Family at Hotel 41,"My husband and I just spent 9 days in London and had the best time of our life.  Hotel 41 was perfect.  The location, the service, the food, the drinks and most of all the friendships that were made with all the staff.  When we left, we felt like we were leaving family.  Before we came to London we had never been treated like royalty, but we now have.  Next time we go to Europe, we will spend a few days or more at Hotel 41."
August 2017,Lovely place,We wanted to stay some where that was elegant .We found it. Lovely people .they will go out of there way to help you. A place like home. Easy access and parking. A lot to see from here too. Will come here again if we can afford it.
August 2017,Stay like Royalty,"We started our week long trip to London in a flat.  We wanted to stay in London like we were living there, but why stay like a commoner when you can live like royalty at Hotel 41.  Looking over the Royal Mews while staying at one of the most exclusive addresses in London.  The staff was excellent and every person was engaging and willing to help.  It is really a notch above other hotels we have stayed at.  The Executive Lounge makes the stay perfect as it is always ready to get you anything you may need."
August 2017,It is not a hotel ...... but home,"My wife and I travelled from Hong Kong to London on vacation. We stayed in this hotel just for the 17th to 18th August.   Here is not much to say and of course no need to say much but:  'It is not a hotel but a home for every traveller'!!  Thanks to the front desk (both day and night shifts), social manager, all servers, house keeping team and everybody there. We support its environmentally-friendly practices as well. The only thing to remind is we have not pay attention is there something like a 'door-bell' or phone at the front door because if someone whose room card does not function, he or she may have difficult to get back into the hotel in the night.   We probably will not be in London in the near future. If we visit London again, Hotel 41 is our first choice. If the staff‚Ä¶"
July 2017,Best Hotel Stay Ever!!,"I can not begin to say how much I enjoyed my stay at the Hotel 41 in July 2017!  This was by far the best hotel I have ever stayed at in the world!  The experience begins at the front door, continues at check-in and the executive lounge, with it all coming together in the Junior Suite.  I cannot compliment enough the entire staff who bent over backwards to take care of me.  Thank you very much!!"
October 2016,The best!!!,"A long overdue review but I had to share that this is the best home away from home in London! My 14 year old daughter and I stayed for a week last October and had such a great time. The hotel is located just next to Buckingham Palace and is an easy walk to lots of sites. You can see into the ""mews"" from the hotel windows and it's a few minute walk if you tour Buckingham Palace. The tea and daily breakfast are delicious and the nightly treats make the evening a fun adventure. The hotel helped us with dinners and transportation as well, and when they found out we were going to see the Harry Potter play they left special witch hat cupcakes for us in our room. Just one of the many special things about staying at Hotel 41. Thank you to everyone there! "
August 2017,Excellence with warmth,"This hotel has set a new bar for me when traveling. The decor is lovely, the food is great, the beds are wonderful, the baths are outstanding - but the staff. The staff is the very best part. Steve Jones in particular went so far above making my teenage son welcome and delighted, it made his trip. No effort was too small, they were always polite, helpful, and kind. This hotel has the kind of polish of the very best service without ever feeling stuffy, and is right across from the palace. Tea time is one of the many delights I highly recommend - the open pantry is stellar. I cannot wait to plan my next stay here."
August 2017,"Awesome hotel, great staff, perfect location",Location puts you in perfect walking distance to all the sights.  The hotel is a boutique that had the best staff of the four different hotels we stayed at in the U.K.  reception area serves as a hub for anything you need.  Rooms were very nice and ultra clean.  Will be back for business trips for sure.
August 2017,The best hotel in the world,"We love Hotel 41 so much. We have stayed there for 13 nights and it was amazing. We were treated on arrival with a lovely glass of champagne which was the best way to start our holidays. Adele and Magdalena were very friendly during the check in process and accomodate all our needs. They also shown us few rooms to choose from to make sure we could  pick our favorite. All the breakfast team are very friendly. Special mention to Alex, Jerry, Marta, Dean and Stefan. The breakfast offering is incredible. Fresh pastries, Smoked fish, cured meat and a large a la carte menu to choose from. The front desk are so helpfull arranging all our needs, Florent, Lauren, Mitchell, Nicole, Victoria, Moreno were all wonderful and have made our stay so special and perfect.  The room was fantastic.‚Ä¶"
June 2017,My Favorite Hotel,"My only wish, after staying here on 4 separate occasions, is that they had a Hotel 41 in every city.  It truly is a wonderful hotel with incredible customer service that every hotel should try and attain.  Each year it's great to see familiar faces and also meet new staff.  The rooms are always immaculate and perfectly decorated.  The shower, as some have noted, are perfect pressure.  The sweets and treats and dinner snacks in the Library are always such a wonderful touch.  The service with breakfast and drinks is spot on.  I wish I could provide some constructive feedback but I simply can't.  My entire family loves visiting Hotel 41 and make it a must on any trip to London.   Thank you so much for another wonderful, memorable stay."
July 2017,Simply Outstanding - AGAIN,"If you haven't tried this little Haven of Paradise yet - I would definitely advise it. It's cozy and comfortable, intimate and private. We really truly counldn't ask or wish for anything more. It's completely relaxing and, whether you stay for 1 night or 7, you feel totally relaxed and refreshed.   It's the wonderful staff that makes the difference for us, they are kind, caring, totally professional, discrete and always go above and beyond the call of duty. They're just amazing, Lauren and Stefan are incredible.   The rooms are comfortable and very tastefully decorated, very clean and supplied with high quality accessories. We now wouldn't consider staying anywhere else and can't recommend Hotel 41 highly enough.   We stayed for a special celebration and we can honestly say that‚Ä¶"
July 2017,The best service!,"Hotel 41 is amazing. The level of service was unlike any other five star hotel I've stayed. It's small and intimate so the staff really get to know their guests. They didn't even ask for my name when we showed up for breakfast because they automatically knew. On the first day I asked for softer bread for my young son (instead of sliced sourdough rolls) and I didn't have to remind them on the following days. They just remembered.  Because it's a smaller property, the atmosphere is quite charming, warm and cozy. The Executive Lounge has complimentary snacks/appetizers 24/7.  It was so great to go there after a long day of sightseeing. We would order a drink and graze on the delicious food. As for the room, the beds were very comfortable. The bedding was top notch.  I highly‚Ä¶"
July 2017,A truly excellent experience ,"I cannot recommend Hotel 41 more highly. It excels at the usual stuff: comfy beds, quiet halls, clean rooms, spacious bathrooms, proximity to the sites and quintessential British decor. Where Hotel 41 excels is in its attention to the guest which I must say is without compare. By the time I left several different staff members had undertaken a coordinated effort to ensure that my departure was smooth and that I had plans for the next stage of my journey. Their executive lounge is akin to a club room as a country club in that it has delicious snacks at all hours and the guests hang about making conversation and meeting one another. Most importantly to the experience is a man named Steve Jones whose role includes: hanging out in the executive lounge, being impeccably dressed,‚Ä¶"
July 2017,Beyond Amazing. Staff is truly next level.,"There are 5 star hotels (and I've stayed at dozens) and then there is Hotel 41 which stands a level above, primarily due to the incredible staff and attention to detail.  I stayed in an Executive Room with my eldest daughter who is 7 (she would most certainly say 7 1/2) for six nights and the experience was phenomenal.  Each morning a member of the staff would help my daughter with her hair, another staff member ran out to get Gatorade at 10pm just because I inquired about where I could go buy some, yet another offered me his old backpack he wasn't using any more for my trip home and gave my daughter beautiful jewelry pins that she loved, and another still got her a tiara to wear when we went to see the show Wicked.  But more important than all these things given to us was the‚Ä¶"
July 2017,Magic.,"Simply a magical experience, once again. (Our second stay at Hotel 41 over the past 3 years). We have stayed at many fine hotels, and although great service is expected and often delivered from them all, none of them achieve the level of intimacy and hospitality like Hotel 41. Just a few examples: Greeting your kids by their names, as if they all knew you for years. Getting tickets to theater when already sold out. Getting tickets to a museum exhibit when already sold out (and complimentary to boot). Baking a chocolate fudge cake just for your kids, the following day from when they asked for a piece of chocolate cake, (that wasn't even on the menu).   They just do not accept not being able to provide you what you ask. I have never experienced such dedication to service.   Truly‚Ä¶"
June 2017,Never felt like this before,"I don't even know how to express my sheer delight that I experienced from my stay at this haven in London. From the very beginning to the end the staff, service and general environment was exhilarating. I have never felt so comfortable nor content at any other hotel that I was a guest. Let me just say that this is 5 star to the max. Thank you everyone for your sincere indulgence of this very captivated American."
July 2017,repeat visit,Excellent hotel with best service you can find.   Great location.   Would gladly recommend to all.  Stayed with our 2 teenagers who loved it.   Lounge is like a private club with free food and staff that is first class
July 2017,Fantastic ,"Our second stay at this absolutely brilliant property, as we bookended at cruise through Scandinavia with two stays separated by 8 d  Staff are fantastically attentive, respectful & engaged to make your visit perfect The lounge is a wonderful place to wind up or wind down with while in London Location is ideal for enjoying the city Strongly recommend "
July 2017,As wonderful as we remembered,"This was our second visit to Hotel 41, two years after our original visit. Hotel 41 was as wonderful as we remembered. Their service and attention to detail is unparalleled.  We arrived about 11:00 AM after our overnight flight from the U.S. via driver arranged by the hotel. The staff welcomed us with the traditional welcome champagne and quickly checked us in. We were pleasantly surprised that our room ‚Äì upgraded to a junior suite ‚Äì was ready in less than fifteen minutes.   Our room contained a lovely fruit plate to welcome us. Alas, the temptations of the Executive Lounge, with its morning breakfast and the evening ‚Äúplunder the pantry‚Äù, made it difficult for us to fully consume the generous contents, which were updated daily.  At our request, the staff had recommended and‚Ä¶"
May 2017,Brilliant hotel,"We love this hotel! It is just like a club, revolving around the executive lounge. We stayed here for 3 nights and were very sad to leave. The staff members were absolutely brilliant. We had many great chats with the staff members in the lounge that made us feel so at home. Our room was extremely comfortable, although we could not get the separate shower to work, so we used the shower over the bath instead. The location near Buckingham Palace and St James's Park was superb. The food in the lounge was very good and plentiful. I loved the 'plunder the pantry' in the late evening and also the many snacks which came with our drinks.  We are returning to London for 2 nights in September, but sadly, will not be staying at 41 as it is booked out for our dates, proof of what a great‚Ä¶"
July 2017,They make magic happen...,"Just back from our second visit to this remarkable, glorious hotel.  Calling it a hotel doesn't seem right.  It's more a private club, a home from home where, just like at Hogwarts, magical creatures (called the staff) work away to meet your every need and wish, usually before you were even aware of that need.  Amazing. From checking in sipping a choice of four champagnes, to the beautifully appointed rooms (those beds are soooo comfy), to the perfection that is the Executive Lounge, to the wee surprises awaiting your return after an evening in the second best city in the world (I'm a Londoner by birth and upbringing, but now live in the best of all cities, Edinburgh üòä).  The purpose of our visit was to attend the third of Adele's concerts at Wembley. Waking up on Saturday‚Ä¶"
June 2017,They treat you like Royalty!,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel 41 for my 65th birthday.  They treat you like Royalty!  The service is outstanding and they even had a birthday cake and a card in my room upon arrival! The food in the Executive Lounge is outstanding....and it is available for breakfast, lunch, tea, dinner and after-dinner heavy snacks.  The service in the Executive room is impeccable.  The location of the hotel was perfect for us as we could easily walk to the Royal Mews, Buckingham Palace, and even Big Ben, Parliament, Westminster Abbey, and the Churchill War rooms.  The rooms had every amenity and were very clean and well serviced.  Everything about the hotel was luxury."
June 2017,Perfect!,"Lost count of the number of times we have stayed at 41 over the last 5 years and we keep coming back because it's the best hotel we have ever experienced.  The team are exceptional in the way they care for their guests.  A few examples on this trip were; being taken up on the roof with champagne to watch the flypast for trooping of the colour, being left a thoughtfully prepared gift in the room the night before we went to see a concert, are just a few of the reasons why we return. It's great to see so many familiar faces in the 41 team each time we return and they greet you with genuine warmth.  They are all great fun and are encouraged to be themselves, not to interact with the formal stuffiness you can experience in other luxury hotels. It feels unfair to single anyone out as‚Ä¶"
August 2016,My new London home,"A small boutique hotel directly opposite Buckingham Palace. I loved this place. The staff went out of their way to make me feel special. I have NEVER had service like this before in my life. The rooms were gorgeous but, be warned, they are in a converted terrace house so are small, dark and oddly shaped at times. Quirky definitely works as a description. I still really enjoyed it as the rooms were very unique. The breakfast was superb and the ice-cream freezer available 24 hours a day was fantastic! Love it when hotels do something a little different. Can't thank everyone on staff enough. I had a sensational stay and felt like the most important person in the world."
June 2017,First class hotel,"This hotel does not have a pool or golf course, but I'll match its service level with any world class hotel I have stayed at, and I've stayed at the tops hotels around the world.  The staff is very well trained with personal attention to all your needs.  The hotel is located at the heart of London with very tight security.  We felt very safe, which is important especially with recent terrorist attacks in London.  Well don!"
June 2017,Our new London home!,"Very small boutique hotel with only 28 rooms and a 2 to 1 staff to guest ratio.  Simply the best and most personalized service anyone could ask for.  All of the staff know your name and room number and remember all of your preferences.  We had a problem with the bathroom sink faucet on the second day, and it was taken care of immediately with a complimentary bottle of wine as an apology. Beautiful classic atmosphere and first class accommodations.  Worth every penny spent.  We will be back.  Maitre'ds Stephan Otto and Andrew Muir were fantastic as was all of the staff.  Can't wait to come back."
June 2017,The MOST incredible experience ,"Our stay at Hotel 41 for the weekend was simply amazing. From being greeted at the front door to anticipating our every need, we experienced a weekend that was truly unforgettable. The service and genuine care you receive from the staff is exquisite. We highly recommend this hotel experience to maximize your time in London. And we will be back. "
June 2017,Amazing Visit,"My wife and I recently visited London for our 20th wedding anniversary.  You can easily read other reviews regarding the convenient walking distance to theaters and eateries, places along the Thames, the luxuriously comfortable rooms, and the beautiful lounge with pantry and evening fare with the availability of top shelf alcoholic beverages.  But it is the service that is second to none.   From the minute you arrive, you are treated as if you are part of a private club where old friends are glad to see you. Upon return from the show Wicked, we had two delicious cupcakes in our room and a playbill picture signed by the lead.  One night they even had an anniversary cake and champagne waiting for us in our room.  The top notch staff could not have been more informative, personable‚Ä¶"
June 2017,2nd Stay and still exceptional!!!,"We overnighted in London on June 3rd and decided to once again pick Hotel 41. Exceptional comfort, service, location, style just across the road from Buckingham Palace Mews. My husband is still raving about the water pressure in the shower. This hotel is basically our go to whenever we visit London forever more!!!!"
June 2017,"Exceptional service, style, comfort in the heart of London","My wife and I recently visited London for some business followed by a few days of vacation. After my conference finished we stayed three nights at Hotel 41.  We were not disappointed.    The hotel is on the 5th floor of another hotel, the Rubens, with a separate street entrance through which you pass by a desk into a short hallway leading to an elevator.  The entrance is staffed throughout the day until midnight by a very engaging man who we enjoyed chatting with daily as we came and went.  Our luggage was brought to our room while we registered.  We were brought to the executive lounge and a glass of champagne (several choices offered) was provided.  The lounge is reasonably spacious and very comfortable with a ""pantry"" located in one corner stocked with a variety of foods‚Ä¶"
June 2017,Excellent Stay,"Excellent stay rin a room that was  exceptional . The staff were the best we have ever had the pleasure to encounter, friendly courteous that you could not find fault with. Nothing was ever to much trouble, they made our stay in London all the more enjoyable. The pantry that was always on offer served excellent food and treats that were complimentary.  Breakfast was amazing , best scrambled eggs have ever had."
June 2017,Amazing hotel,This hotel is very special indeed...if you want sheer luxury with amazing staff then this the place to stay. Its 5 star which really does go above & beyond for your stay. We had a 3 night stay with a room with views of the Royal Mews it was the best bed i have ever slept in. The food/service/staff awesome. We can't wait to visit again.
June 2017,"Excellent service, incredible location","The service at Hotel 41 is just wonderful. We stayed there for three nights, and the small service touches were nice, e.g. they took the time to ask whether we were vegetarian (my wife is) and then the chef made a separate appetizer for her over the complimentary afternoon snacks.  The location is perfect if you are there as a tourist -- one block from Buckingham Palace, and easy walking distance to Big Ben, The National gallery, and much more, and one block from the tube. Their executive lounge is perfect to relax with great light food (complimentary) and drinks. The price of the hotel (it is a bit on the expensive side) was worth it.  However, this is still London, where space is at a premium. So the rooms are not large, and the executive lounge is cosy as opposed to grand.‚Ä¶"
August 2016,BEYOND EXCELLENT! Simply superlative and more,"I usually don't post on Trip Advisor because frankly I find it a place where folks overhype a place or have an ax to grand and rarely use it as a once source for my travel needs. This one is an exception. This boutique luxury hotel is mind-blowing in terms of service and taking care of one's unique travel needs. If you need to be near Buckingham Palace or Victoria Station, there is no choice but Hotel 41. On this trip I needed all type of different stuff that I usually do - dry cleaning, pressing, ice cream at 2:45 am, tux pick up and return, even a haircut and beard trim. No request was not met with a same. The executive lounge is you private pantry and bar and is stocked with liquors you never heard of. I have done a fair amount of traveling and always been disappointed when a‚Ä¶"
June 2017,41 Has Redefined Hospitality,"The Hotel 41 has entirely redefined Five-Star Hospitality!  Some friends had told me about the Conservatory Suite at 41, and following some research, I asked my travel agent to book it for my week in London.  I will never be able to thank those friends enough!  Although branded separately, 41 is actually the most exclusive rooms available at the Rubens at the Palace, and is directly across Buckingham Palace Road from the Royal Mews, which are the stables and garages of Buckingham Palace.  The parlor of the Conservatory Suite looks directly through the gate of the Mews.  There is a very small entry-way from the street, and an elevator will takes you straight up to the fifth floor, and the Executive Lounge.  There really isn't a ""front desk"" just a little table in the corner of‚Ä¶"
June 2017,Grandest Hotel Visit,"Upon arrival at 41, we were treated to a hotel tradition of champagne.  We chose the Queen's favorite, which was exquisite. As we sipped our champagne,  we perused the fantastic library. When we arrived in our room, there was a fresh basket of fruit and a plate of chocolates.  Snacks were available in the library as well as drinks. Hourderves were served prior to dinner. All of this was included in the price. The staff was exceptional.  On the phone, there is a button for ""whatever/ whenever"". If travelling to London, this is the hotel to stay at. I will definitely be returning!!!"
June 2017,Classic Elegance,"We recently returned from our third stay at Hotel 41.  As always it was amazing!  The staff works together to ensure that the guests' visits go smoothly.  We likened it to some swans we saw on a small river near Southampton.  The current was fairly swift, but the swans appeared to be beautiful and calm.  We know their feet were paddling quickly to stay in place.  The staff at this hotel are constantly working behind the scenes to make sure guests are treated with courtesy and efficiency.  We owe a special debt of gratitude to Adele.  We already have the hotel booked two more times in the next year."
June 2017,It doesnt get any better than this!!,"From the moment you walk in, the staff truly treats you like family. I've travelled a lot and this hotel is head and shoulders above many. Hotel 41 sets the benchmark for all other hotels to aspire to. The room was breathtaking and the decor was first class. Location is exceptional with everything right out your door. If staying in London, look no further. Hotel 41 will be seeing us over and over again. What an amazing group of people! "
May 2017,Customer Service,"The hotel and rooms are interesting, but frankly, what sets this place apart is customer service. Period. They are focused on you getting the most out of your stay.  The Salon is where all the action is. We didn't do this, but on a rainy, dreary London day, I could imagine spending nearly all of it sitting in the Salon and reading. Probably not the best place for young kids  Great location for all things in Westminster. Loved it"
May 2017,Unbelieveable Experience,"In traveling many places in the world, we have not experienced such outstanding accommodations as we did during our stay at Hotel 41. First, it's location is just down the street from Buckingham Place, and is convenient to most attractions. Hotel 41 has a limited number of rooms, which convey the feeling of being special. To that point the service and  dedication to detail is without approach. The quality of the dining was excellent. The staff was very friendly and responded to every need, truly professional. If you desire the best, Hotel 41 should be your selection! Glenn & Kae Erickson, Danville, California, USA"
May 2017,Wonderful stay after a memorable afternoon at a Royal garden Party,"From the moment we arrived nothing was too much trouble for the incredible staff at Hotel 41. We were made to feel like part of the family. The personal service extended to friends who joined us for drinks before supper. Our room was beautiful, light and airey with candle as part of the turn down service. Canapes and snacks were plentiful and delicious. We will certainly return for a special occasion"
May 2017,The Best Hotel In The World,"This was the best hotel stay I've ever experienced.  It is a smaller hotel, so you feel pampered and taken care of with a personal touch from every employee who all greet you with a smile.  The staff are courteous and quick to respond to any issue or request.  Rooms are luxurious and 5-star quality all around, no issues of cleanliness or missing amenities (and if you did need anything, again the staff is on call and eager to assist you).  The Executive Lounge for breakfast, drinks, afternoon tea, or late night snacks is an ornate room with classic and elegant decor.  Located in beautiful Westminster just opposite Buckingham Palace's Royal Mews, fine dining and beautiful sightseeing is just minutes away on foot.  Victoria Station for Underground service is only a short walk as‚Ä¶"
May 2017,High standards maintained!!!,We stayed here again during our 2nd trip to London and had the same quiet room 4109.  The staff anticipated our every need.  The lounge where breakfast is served is great.  The location is very central to call areas of London as fellas walking distance to Victoria station.
May 2017,Favorite Hotel and Staff!,"Hotel 41 is our favorite Hotel ever and everywhere!  Beautiful Boutique Style and the Staff - AMAZING!  This was our second visit and we can't wait to go back.  Perfect location too!!!! We walked to see the changing of the guard, palace and many other tourist attractions.  The food and wine selection is delicious too!  Oh and most important the BED WAS SO COMFY COZY!"
May 2017,Best Hotel and staff ,"Beautiful small hotel with one of the most amazing staffs ever!  They were so responsive, helpful and friendly....like none I have ever encountered before!  We loved the entire experience and will definitely make this our hotel in London!"
May 2017,Amazing Hotel and service,My wife and I just spent a night here for a wedding anniversary and had a wonderful time. All the staff were very helpful and polite. We stayed in the Monarch suite which I highly recommend. Amazing food in an amazing building with great staff. If you are in London this is the place to stay! 
May 2017,Great Hotel in London,"Hotel 41 located in London is a gem in a city with hundreds of highly ranked hotels. This hotel should have a 10 star rating as it trumps most of the big name places. My wife and I were in London for seven days and very happy that we chose Hotel 41. The service, and personal attention that this hotel gives its clients is over the top. The staff was very helpful and always went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of.   Hotel 41 is directly across the street from the Buckingham Palace Royal Mews, and just a short walk away form many other London attractions; Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abby, Big Ben, Houses of Parliament, St. James Park, The Green Park, Trafargar Square, Piccadilly Circus, just to name a few. There are also plenty of restaurants and shopping in the‚Ä¶"
April 2017,I will definitely stay here again,"Stayed here for 5 nights in April 2017 and loved it.  Room was clean, cleverly designed, executive room was really nice and had great food and drink options.  Hotel is well located and has a fantastic atmosphere.  But really, the best thing about this hotel is the staff; I've stayed in a few 5 star hotels before and have often found the attention over-the-top, but the Hotel 41 team offer the perfect level of hospitality  Their staff are intelligent and great at engaging with guests with the right amount of care.  My wife and I joked about Hotel 41 being our new home-away-from-home and I am looking forward to my next visit."
June 2016,A Beautiful Place!,"We stayed here as a splurge for one night in London. It was in the perfect location, central to shops, restaurants, and sites in London.The room was clean, quiet, and comfortable and we couldn't have asked for a better stay."
May 2017,"Great location, amazing service","Hotel 41 is a boutique hotel at the top floor of a classic London building near Buckingham Palace.  Two features make Hotel 41 a really special place:  The incredible level of service, that manages to be efficient, friendly, and attentive to detail (hey they will pack your luggage if you want!)  The executive lounge, a beautiful wood-paneled large lounge with a mezzanine. It is a great place to relax or grab a bite away from the hustle and bustle of the City. They serve breakfast, high tea, and have a full bar + snacks pretty during the whole day."
April 2017,We miss Hotel 41 already,"We spent 8 nights at 41 and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The staff was friendly, engaged and efficient. It was a pleasure to start the day with a fantastic breakfast in the Executive Lounge where the wait staff greeted us with a smile, remembered our names, and offered assistance with our plans for the day. They have truly mastered the art of fine service. The room was spotless, well-appointed with a very comfy bed. Turn down service included nightly treats and the staff provided a special treat related to our visit to the play: Wicked. So very nice and thoughtful. When we return to London, we will stay here again.  I‚Äôm really concerned that we‚Äôve been spoiled and no other hotel will live up to Hotel 41."
May 2017,Beyond Belief,"Ah, so you want to spoil your partner to a five star trip into London for their birthday. You might think to go somewhere fashionable like The Savoy or The Ritz. You may do that, but you shall certainly not be treated as well. I assure you. To say the staff are great is useless. These are not staff - they are artists! Hospitality is their craft and it is beyond belief. It's the details. They anticipate your requirements. Exceed them. You never feel like you're on a conveyor belt of care, no. More like an experience of a life time. Many other hotels would do well to study how Hotel 41 perform. Impeccable rooms. Great food and drink. No request is too large or detail to small.   Next time, though, I shall really test them!"
April 2017,Hotel 41 ( 4+1=5star Experiece),"What can I say - fantastic. We made our Easter great by visiting Rome, and on our way back to Dublin we wanted to stay in a top hotel in London. As a surprise I found Hotel 41 on the top of the list, so we decided to try it. Advice: Try it! It was amazing! I will never regret that decision. Lovely room, luxurious in every aspect and everywhere around you! If love luxurious we need to try this one!  "
January 2017,Highly recommended!,Me and my partner had the most fantastic stay here! 5* well deserved. Would highly recommend this to anyone staying in London! Absolute bliss. We had the most fantastic nights sleep in a top room! Brilliant! 
June 2016,25th Anniversary ,Words won't accurately describe this experience. It was other-worldly. I've stayed in many of the nicest hotels around the world and not one comes even close to the quality and service of this hotel. It's just in a different league all its own. Favorite hotel experience of all-time!
March 2017,Excellence,Nothing but fantastic. Beautiful hotel with outstanding services all around. Actually better than our own in NYC....... Stayed only for 11 hours but it was worthwhile to hub. Will return to this landmark Hotel. The Caesar salad in the midst of the night was a wonder.
March 2017,Superb,"This hotel was amazing. If you are accustomed to staying at nice hotels and you anticipate the luxury concierge treatment, this hotel is for you. It is directly across the street from the Royal Mews, which is located on the edge of Buckingham Palace. The nearby South African restaurant has great food as well. I used this as the base of operations and was able to comfortably tube around London. Easy access to Victoria station and then hop on the circle or victoria lines to get where you need to go."
April 2017,In A League Of Its Own,"I'm not so comfortable with the phrase 'home from home'.  Though we have a perfectly nice home life, we don't get waited on hand and foot by delightfully pleasant people who enjoy their jobs; we don't get our requirements anticipated and acted upon; nor do we enjoy such incredible luxury in our bedroom/suite, a turndown service, wonderful surprises popping up here, there and everywhere.  At home, we have a pantry, but nothing to compare to this, and though we have a few bottles, it's nowhere near the superb range available at the bar.  So, 41 is much, much more than home from home, for us anyway.  A mistake was in fact made.  It's not the making of a mistake that marks the quality of an establishment, it's the nature of the response.  And I've never seen anything like this‚Ä¶"
April 2017,A Truly Special Hotel Experience,Everything at Hotel 41 was perfect. The staff were so wonderful and attentive. The room was very comfortable and quiet. Everything you could want was right at your fingertips. The location was perfect. Hotel 41 is a gem of a hotel in a fantastic city. 
February 2017,Wonderful Experience ,"This is the best hotel ever the only hotel where at the end of your break you simply do not want to go home!  I took my daughter Heather for her Birthday as we had tickets for Harry Potter. It is not the first time I have stayed now it is my favourite place.  Everything is superb and consistent on every visit. From the soothing champagne arrival just what you need after the travelling to all the little things they suggest and do through out your stay . I had organised a few birthday surprises a cake made in house, balloons & flowers everything was presented beautifully as requested with great thanks to Flo. From suggesting restaurants, receiving shopping, and organising taxis so very helpful nothing is too trivial for them the attention to detail spot on. The food is lovely very‚Ä¶"
March 2017,An excellent stay at this boutique hotel in the heart of London.,"The small hotel of only thirty rooms is perfect in my opinion. You enter on the ground floor where a receptionist buzzes you in and are taken to the fifth floor for check-in at the concierge desk. We were told to leave our luggage downstairs and were greeted by name when we arrived upstairs. We sat at the desk and were served our choice of champagnes. We were checked in quickly and brought to our room with our luggage already waiting. The rooms was spacious and well appointed. The bathroom was fine, perhaps a little small with a tub/shower combo. We were only there for 3 nights and spent our 2 full days sightseeing away from the hotel. We had continental breakfast the first morning and it and the service were excellent. When we asked for directions to a specific pub for dinner‚Ä¶"
March 2017,This Place Will Ruin You,"I booked this hotel because it looked cool in a picture, seriously, it's not the smartest way to book a hotel. I probably did look at its ratings but I didn't put much thought into it.  Wow, did I luck out! We arrived 3 hours before check in to a champagne toast in a lounge after we were escorted in by the lobby manager. The Lounge is set up like a library in a beautiful mansion with tables and settees that are set with beautiful linens. It boasts a snack area that is stocked 24x7 with chips, ice cream, beverages, and snacks. At night they provide ""light"" fare but you probably could call it a light dinner and not go out.  The morning breakfast is in the same room and all service is impeccable and formal without being stuffy.  We came to our room the first night after dinner to‚Ä¶"
March 2017,Loved it!,Look no further for a wonderful place to lay your head after spending the day in a beautiful and lively city!  Service is impeccable and they are truly happy to help you with anything you need. There were nightly gifts on our bed which was a wonderful touch welcoming us back from a long day being tourists. And as mentioned many times in posts the nightly Plunder the Pantry was a highlight of our day.  Relaxing by the fire in a comfy chair reviewing our day with snacks and beverage of choice. Buckingham palace is right across the street and we were delighted one morning to see the horse and carriages come out for a little walk around.  Also there's a pub across the street where we met locals who loved to chat and a little diner style eatery where we ate most mornings before‚Ä¶
March 2017,Early birthday trip,"Booked this hotel as an early birthday treat, glass of champagne whilst you check in all the staff were amazing attentive without being intrusive,  our room was lovely they left two cup cakes and a card and that night rose petals on the bedside table the turn down service is lovely little gift each night left on the bed which I have to say was huge and very cosy, beautiful breakfast, lots of nice choices very fresh .they do dried fruits, nuts, crisps, popcorn, ice cream scones mid afternoon all free through the day then in the evening they do 'plunder the pantry' cold meats, cheese, little desserts and a hot dish. As I said the staff make this place delightful Steve was charming as was the young man from South Africa and all the girls were dressed extremely smart couldn't do‚Ä¶"
March 2017,Perfection,"How do you define perfection? Well, the beautifully located Hotel 41 in the heart of London comes to mind. This is my daughter and my second stay at the Hotel 41 and to be perfectly honest, I would never stay anywhere else while visiting one of my favorite cities. From our warm reception upon arrival to our final good-byes and all the cherished moments in-between the entire staff helped to create our home away from home. Each mornig heading out after breakfast and armed with travel advice and snacks, it was always a pleasure to return ""home"" after an exciting day to share experiences with the staff who were genuinely interested in our stories. Plunder the Pantry was a brilliant offering and each evening my daughter and I would meet to take part in all the delicious goodies. I‚Ä¶"
February 2017,Absolutely fabulous,"Lost for words really. Everything about 41 was wonderful, the service was excellent and the staff so friendly and obliging.

August 2016,Excellent Service,"they offered a coffee and a bag of something that we had to bring with us. like everyone the service is very simply and all. I am with my friends when we go here, my friend occupied a one bedroom to all of us. this place is very luxury but it is worth it."
March 2017,more than 5 star,"Wow- from the moment we arrived we were treated like Royalty. extremely polite and friendly staff. We have over the years stayed in some Fabulous hotels ( Cape Grace SA. Savoy London,+++) none of them go that extra mile that 41 goes to. nothing was too much trouble, we required an ice bucket, 2 minutes later it arrived. needed a reservation for dinner- sorted . The car was looked after very well(Valet Parking)  The stay was for my Birthday and there was a cake waiting for us in the room and Birthday wishes from the staff.I cannot recommend this Hotel highly enough 6 stars would not be enough, we chose the Hotel because of the Trip Advisor reviews and it turned out to be a very good decision.  A huge thank you to all the staff who made our stay probably the best stay that we have‚Ä¶"
March 2017,The ratings should go up to 6 for this place,"I'm fully aware that this may sound like another gushing review and one must think they put something in the drinks at Hotel 41, but whatever it is I'll gladly have more. You never quite know how good service can be until you stay here. First, we were immediately upgraded to a nicer suite. There was a lovely fireplace and a little lounge space with champagne on arrival, a huge bed and fantastic bathroom with a bath and superb shower and all the little extras I wouldn't even have thought to ask for! The executive lounge is where it all happens, whether relaxing in front of the fireplace or under the astounding globe centrepiece, we were treated like old friends. They seem to have struck the perfect balance between being friendly and utterly attentive without being intrusive.‚Ä¶"
February 2017,Top weekend,My wife and I spent the weekend here. Outstanding location and even better staff and food. Nothing was any trouble and all the staff was friendly towards us. Even got a member of staff to come on a run with me. Couldn't of ask for more. 
February 2017,Extraordinary,"Our annual business trip to London turned into to an exceptionally comfortable, low-key and ""warm"" experience thanks to the extraordinary staff and five-star-service every member provided at Hotel 41.   First and foremost, the hotel couldn't be located at a better location for travel as it's located a few quick minutes from Victoria Station. In terms of walking, restaurants and landmarks abound - all within a few quick minutes distance.  We booked a split level suite for our trip and the designed served several purposes. First, we had a separate space downstairs with a cozy couch, warm fireplace and small table - which was replenished daily with a bowl of delicious fresh fruit.  The second level was a spacious bedroom with lovely windows, a large and comfortable bed, and extra‚Ä¶"
November 2016,It's Everything They Say,"My husband and I stayed a few nights at Hotel 41 in early November to celebrate our anniversary.  Given the reviews, hotel website and price, we were expecting nothing less than excellence - and that is what we received.  I think what impressed us the most was how comfortable the hotel and experience was.  There is a thing as being doted on too much and the staff at Hotel 41 know exactly the right balance.  Each night we sat by the fire for at least an hour to wind down, have a drink and think about the day that we had and what was on tap for the next day.  The staff came by to chat a bit but also gave us space to enjoy our evening.  I also think that this hotel, while very expensive, is a good value.  The stay includes the ""plunder the pantry"" and snacks to take on your daily‚Ä¶"
February 2017,Incredible value highly recommended ,"We stay for two day only but we're sure next time we will come back to stay here, room so comfortable with all of facilities you gonna need... Nothing bad to say. Staff very kind on reception they try to speak even in our language.. Was and amazing time hopefully we could come back soon. "
February 2017,2 night anniversary break,"What can i say this hotel is nothing short of perfect, myself and my husband had a 2 night stay to celebrate our wedding anniversary and from the moment we arrived we loved the place. Every member of staff was so friendly which to us made the stay even better. The room was lovely,and the little extras are a delightful surprise. The executive loung where we had breakfast each morning is so relaxing and the breakfast and evening meal we had here was the best I have had in a while. Will definitely be returning."
February 2017,Beyond Excellent ,"I booked this hotel for my mother's birthday as I saw a newspaper article on it a while back. She loves luxury hotels and it can be difficult to impress her, but she told me that it was the best hotel she has ever stayed in.   I booked the king room and it was really nice and spacious and even had a fire place, they left a little birthday cake for her too (it was very tasty) all of the staff are really knowledgable and friendly. My mother loved it so much she wants to go again, maybe I'll book it for her next birthday too. I'll probably get my dad to go with her instead of me as it is a nice hotel for couples.   Thank you for our stay, my mum loved and she wishes TripAdvisor had more than 5 stars. 'Beyond excellent' in her words thanks again. "
February 2017,Simply outstanding.,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for my birthday treat, and a treat it was. The actual hotel is located on the 5th floor of Rubens at the palace. It's a beautiful building with a striking 350 square meter living side wall. As soon as we entered the hotel the  level of service was outstanding. As we sat down at the grand check in desk, in the beautiful executive lounge, it was explained that it is tradition to have a glass of champagne and the only difficult decision was pink or white! After checking in we decided to finish our drink in front of the roaring fire and admired the amazing room. The complimentary snacks on offer are exceptional, sweets, popcorn, chocolate, olives etc and a fridge full of ice cream. Our room was lovely, we opted for an executive king. We had a‚Ä¶"
February 2017,Top notch boutique hotel,"Just stayed for 6 nights. This hotel is all about service. They pamper you from the minute you arrive. I can not say enough about the level of service. I did not want to leave. The staff is great but I must give extra compliments to Adele. A couple of negatives- room 4107 shares a wall with the housekeeping closet. There were loud banging noises at times. This can be somewhat annoying when you want to relax after a long trip or day of sightseeing. It seemed to happen first thing in the morning and throughout the day. With that being said it would absolutely not deter me from coming back. And if you are accustomed to a ""rainshower"" type shower then I would suggest requesting that up front. Our first room had a shower nozzle that was hand held. Not what I'm used to and may not be‚Ä¶"
January 2017,Great location,Its in a good location hotel yeah deffo u can find more cheap hotels around but that one is good we realy enjoyed our stay its a big and very confortable hotel. Theres good staff working here we will be back x
December 2016,Lovely,This hotel was just fantastic! I've never been to a more beautiful place to stay! Everything is so quaint and the staff is just overwhelmingly friendly! Don't make it to London often but when I do you can bet I'll stay here!
December 2016,"Love this Hotel - Staff Fabulous, Food Fabulous, overall Fabulous",I stayed here with my husband and i can honestly our visit was perfect.  To say the staff were welcoming and professional is an understatement.  The beautiful room was ready when we checked in (at 12 noon!) which was a bonus. We headed out to the shops and on our return we were delighted to see a bottle of wine in our room - just right to start our evening.  We had a drink in the cozy bar when we returned and again the service was amazing.  I didnt want to go home and will definately be back - Thank you to all!
January 2017,Good place to stay ,Hotel 41 is a good modern hotel with all the necessary items in the room. We stayed there for 4 nights and had a awesome experience. Neat and clean city. Must visit if your budget is above 5 lakhs for enjoying and exploring the city.
January 2017,Home from Home - only better,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights last week.  We enjoyed every minute of it.  Room was wonderful with fire burning and even a hot water bottle in the bed in the evening (not seen one of those since my boarding school days). The lounge was wonderful, great snacks and great service.  Breakfast was also good. Staff friendly and seemed genuinely interested in hearing how our day went, if we wanted a taxi etc. etc. Had a guest visiting Friday evening - he was also very impressed.  Enjoyed a gin and tonic in the lounge - so cozy. The location of the hotel is also great.  As we didnt have our lazy children with us we could walk into town - every day - past Buckingham Palace and then either through Green Park or down The Mall.  Perfect. Definately better than home - I dont‚Ä¶"
December 2016,very very nice hotel,We could'.nt say more then people have to say. That the staff was very friendly and very nice with us.  We enjoyed every moment ant the location was important for us.  The bedroom was very clean and comfortable.  Stayed in november. we will be back for sure
December 2016,Consistently superb!,"This was our 5th Christmas at 41, and yet again it was an absolute pleasure.  Florent and Lauren, as always, are exceptional and go out of their way to make us feel like family returning home for the holidays.  Their absolute professionalism, personal touches, sense of fun and genuine care for their guests is what keeps us coming back, again and again!  Every member of the team at 41 is involved with making the whole experience so special.  From those we met in passing while walking through the corridors  to those who served us our breakfast every day and our drinks every night. Everyone we met during our stay showed the same level of care and attention to detail which is what we feel sets 41 apart from other luxury hotels.  It's the little things they do during your stay that‚Ä¶"
January 2017,Amazing Experience ,"Thank you to the staff at Hotel 41!  They could not do enough for us from the smallest tasks to the largest. They made my daughter and I feel at home and welcomed. The executive lounge was lovely and the breakfasts amazing. The rooms could not have been cleaner. The bed was large and comfortable with perfect feather pillows and the down comforters kept us toasty warm. The fire place was definitely put to good use and made the room very cozy and inviting. The staff made a point to ask what we had planned for the day and always followed up (remembering where we went) and asking how we found it. We spent 5 nights at Hotel 41 and could not wait to get back after a long day of sight seeing or a night at the theater. The small lobby that you enter has a staff member there, greeting us‚Ä¶"
December 2016,Absolutely fantastic ambiance!,I enjoyed my stay while in London. The room was everything I had hoped for and I was  completely satisfied with the room service. The staff are friendly and efficient coupled with the luxurious surrounding being top in its league. Highly recommended!
October 2016,Room was beautiful and was great value for money,"Staff were welcoming from when we arrived until we departed and the room was an escape from the world, would recommend this accommodation to all of my friends and  Family 5 * quality A definite must have experience"
January 2017,Very nice!,"We really loved this hotel. Our bed was super comfortable, room was clean and hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. I can recommend this hotel for everyone. You really made our holiday. Thank you!"
January 2017,Just fantastic ,"There's really not much more I can say than others have. This was a treat for my wife's birthday and even though we only stayed one night, we felt like the staff already knew us.   The executive lounge is lovely, the staff are great, and they even upgraded us for free. Nothing is too much trouble.   We will be back! "
January 2017,5* +++,"Best service in a hotel I've experienced. Friendly, efficient, helpful - the list goes on. Faultless. Great room - faultless! Superb location. Welcome reception - superb. Refreshing hot towel & small fruit punch offered. Check out equally as good. Just how a great hotel should be!!"
January 2017,FIRST CLASS - CANNOT RECOMMEND HIGHLY ENOUGH,"My husband and I stayed here on Saturday 21st January, the trip to London to see a show and hotel 41 stay was a Christmas gift from our daughters.  I had seen Hotel 41 reviewed in a newspaper last year as being the Number 1 Hotel in London and I am delighted to have experienced it.  Having stayed in many hotels around the world, this has to be the very top of the list.  We checked in early and were thrilled to be given an ""upgrade"" to a junior suite.  A birthday cake and canap√©s were awaiting us in the room, what a delightful touch.  The Service and attention to details is an absolute credit to the management and staff.  The hotel has a great ambiance and we can't recommend it highly enough.  We are definitely going to stay here again.  Great work Hotel 41, it was a pleasure and‚Ä¶"
January 2017,Little oasis of calm...with a feel of the ministry of magic!,"From the moment we entered the lobby we were transported into a different world! One where the wellbeing of the customer is a top priority. The staff are so pleasant and friendly without being overbearing or fussy.  The attention to detail is incredible. The room was exquisite and had everything a guest could need (except an emery board...but I'm sure if I had pressed the 'whatever whenever' button one would have magically appeared!) the bed was so comfortable and the room was quiet.  When looking to book this hotel many reviews talk of the free food available...canap√©s, the pantry, ice-creams and chocolates... but even without all those treats and goodies the place deserves its no.1 status.  The breakfast was excellent too. We even got invited back to the lounge hours after‚Ä¶"
December 2016,best hotel ever,I recently had the pleasure of staying for 2 nights and had a wonderful time. The service was incredible. Easily the best hotel I have ever stayed in and cannot wait to return. Thank you to everyone at 41 for such an amazing experience.
November 2016,A Wonderful Place - Heaven On Earth,"Really good time here, situated well allowing us to spend as much time as we like gawking at Buckingham palace. Would highly recommend a stay here.  The rooms are well kept as was the staff, who were ever so friendly and polite. A lovely place."
January 2017,Long Weekend in London,"Spent two nights at what is quite simply the best hotel I have stayed in anywhere in the world. So what was so special and why will this be our only choice of London hotels in the future. Location - 5 mins walk from Victoria so ideal for all the sights, Selfridges, Harrods etc.  A short walk to Peggy Porschen, Sloane squ and Kings Road.  Welcome - greeted with champagne on arrival. Relaxed in lounge and then escorted to room when ready. Luggage already there ( nice touch).    Room - immaculate. Penhaligons toileteries, Sky channels if you fancied a night in.  Tea lights at turn down and a little circle of rose petals last thing at night. Not forgetting the hot water bottle in bed as well.  Very comfortable bed and pillows and lovely robes for lounging.  Foyer - complimentary hot‚Ä¶"
January 2017,Secret Escape !,"This hotel is a guilty pleasure ! By far the most accommodating hotel you will find so close to Buckingham Palace, The staff go above and beyond to make your stay a memorable experience, nothing is too much trouble, yet it feels so personable almost like a home from home , if you are looking for a secret escape for some R&R with the entertainment that London can iff but a stones throw away this is the one for you."
January 2017,Another great stay at 41,"Just returned from another very enjoyable stay at Hotel 41. We wouldn't think to stay anywhere else in London. Great location, lovely hotel, fantastic staff. Looked after from the moment we arrived, the staff were friendly and professional as always, attending to your every need, providing advice if required. Can't do enough for you.  Super breakfast, breakfast butty and Eggs Benedict this time complimented with a good quality continental buffet. Canap√©s in the early evening and butler's pantry to satisfy any later hunger.  Look forward to visiting again soon. "
January 2017,Must stay for top luxury experience,"This is a fabulous intimate boutique hotel in a fantastic location, steps from Buckingham Palace and the Victoria tube. Close walking distance to all the posh shops and restaurants as well as the best sites to see.   I can't say enough about the staff and hotel itself. Warm, friendly and they call guests by name as soon as they enter the hotel.  Andrew, the guest experience manager, organized the best restaurants in London for us, and planned every last detail, and room details, including, roses, candles, and an anniversary cake for our anniversary. He's just fantastic!  The room was a king studio decorated perfectly with all the amenities one can imagine. Truly a wonderful experience for those looking for uncompromising quality in the heart of London. I would highly recommend.‚Ä¶"
December 2016,Absolutely excellent place!,"This hotel is a hidden gem.  It is a small hotel located on a main street.  From the minute you walk in you are greeted with a hot chocolate and lots of little treats; sweets, nuts, dried fruit.  In the main lobby there is a buffet cart which is constantly being refilled with a range of snacks from sweets to cold meats to curries.  You could literally stay in the hotel all day and enjoy the range of snacks and treats.  There is also a lovely fireplace which makes sitting in the lounge that bit more special.   The staff are incredible too, nothing is too much trouble.  They are always there to answer any questions or make suggestions.  The rooms are well presented and the bed is very comfortable.   It is an excellent hotel and worth a visit.  It may be a little pricey but all the‚Ä¶"
February 2016,Luxurious and discreet.,"Our go to hotel in London when we want a quiet stay. The service is flawless from the second you walk in, champagne on entry and free food, drink, ice cream etc for duration of your stay helps make it a memorable one! Its as if the staff are on your shoulder at all times to top your drink up or assist in any request but they manage it without making you feel awkward, almost as if they are invisible until needed! Lounge area is great for a night cap around the fire."
January 2017,Book well in advance. Not a spec of dust,"This hotel is unreal. Everything is posh, clean and clean again. Polished floors, clean windows and friendly staff. Great location, great london prices and definitely a place to unwind by the fire in the big leather chairs with a whiskey and a book. I couldnt fault Hotel 41 "
December 2016,love this place,great rooms and excellent food available throughout the day combined with very helpful staff and extras such as champagne at breakfast and hot water bottles so good we have booked for next year.The executive lounge is a great place to spend a little time and the location of the hotel next to Buckingham Palace is extremely useful
December 2016,Outstanding!,"Stayed for four nights and could not be happier with our choice. Every aspect of the stay was fantastic from the booking through to checkout. To say the service was phenomenal would be an understatement. Each and everyone on the staff at Hotel 41 provided distinctive service with an attention to detail and guest satisfaction. PHENOMENAL is more like it. Highly recommend Hotel 41, especially at the holidays and definitely on New Years Eve!"
December 2016,Excellent,"This hotel is more like a private home with butler service and superb chefs at your service 24/7. Rooms are good and fine but nothing special, apart from comfy beds and all the normal five star attributes, but the thing with 41 is the lobby/library section which really feels like your own living room. I will definitely go back again and again."
December 2016,Love love love!,"Staff was phenomenal! It's not often that you get a hotel with such great service! I was here with my hubby for a week, and I fell in love with it! I will most certainly be back in town to visit! Loved it!"
December 2016,Christmas at Hotel 41,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for  a 3 night stay over Christmas. I can't imagine having more friendly attentive staff throughout the stay who could not have made us feel for more welcome and special throughout our stay.  The rooms and lounge were to a exceptional standard. The food and treats on offer in this lounge are the best I have experienced in executive lounges thought out the uk and overseas. We were more than happy to pay for the drinks in the lounge. The lounge is a real chill out area with lovely snacks and a great chess set. Food at the hotel was amazing, the breakfast hash  browns were to die for and our Christmas Day meal of rib of beef was beautiful. This hotel is a must for anyone wishing to spend a few days in total luxury with such care and attention given from all‚Ä¶"
November 2016,Hotel 41,"A difficult hotel to review without sounding all to gushing.  In the little time I spent at this hotel, unfortunately only a single day and night, has led me to the conclusion that it is without a doubt the single best hotel experience I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.  From the moment we arrived the service is impeccable and it seems that every care has been taken to make your stay as comfortable as poaaible.  The champagne and canap√©s on arrival and the subsequent food that is lavished upon you at a moment's notice as well as the overall level of service really do leave you with lasting impression of quality and hospitality that is second to nonw.  The rooms from what I saw are finished to a very high standard and toiletries and accoutrements in the room are of a‚Ä¶"
December 2016,Essence of British Luxury and Service,"I cannot say enough about how wonderful the service, food and accommodations were for our pre-Christmas trip to London.  Hotel 41 will be our choice on our next trip unless someone can irrefutably prove to us that there is something better in London - a feat not likely to occur.  Service is simply perfect.  Attention to every detail but without undue imposition. Cleanliness was impeccable - seldom seen at any hotel at any price. Value for the over-the-top experience was frankly a bargain.  This is a 29 room boutique carved out of the larger Rubens Hotel in the same building but this little gem has its own private entrance and elevator that only goes to the 5th floor where this is located.  One common room impressively comfortable for meals and drinks and conversation.  Some‚Ä¶"
November 2016,"I could come to London, never leave Hotel 41 and be happy!","My first stay at Hotel 41 was with my husband on our first trip to London. It was such a delightful experience there was no question where I would stay in London on this trip. This trip was with my daughter (14) and a friend. The hotel arranged a suite to accommodate all of us. The service, food, room and atmosphere were all superb. London was lovely and Hotel 41 'made' the trip for us. The staff was helpful and they knew who we were. Such great care was taken of us. Have tea there, such a treat! Thanks for everything.  "
May 2016,Perfect and Terrific,"If you wanna experience one of the best and terrific London luxury experience you definitely need to go at Hotel 41. Everything is perfect since the first moments and steps you move onto the premises. Excellent service, excellent staff and simply excellent venue right in the middle of the Royal London. You can never be disappointed when booking a stay here. Definitely worth the visit. Priceless."
December 2016,The Best,"Florent and his team have to be the best. The warmest welcome and genuine too; nothing is too much trouble. We choose not to stay anywhere else in London now. We love the attention to detail eg the hot water bottle put in bed for us and fresh fruit in our room. We love ""raid the pantry"" after an evening at the theatre. Why other hotels don't do it is beyond me. The location is perfect. We can't wait for our next visit."
December 2016,There is a reason why we keep coming back! Incredible Hotel!,"This was our third stay at Hotel41.  My thoughts and words that I've written in my previous reviews haven't changed a bit.   It's still simply outstanding!  Without repeating much of what I've written in my two previous reviews it's safe to say that my expectations were once again met and well and truly exceeded. It's just such a unique & exciting experience when staying at this Hotel as you become a friend as opposed to another 'number'. The single level devoted to this Hotel keeps everything nice and simple. The guest focused service though I've rarely experienced at other Hotels of this level.  Flo, Magdalena & Steve Jones all deserve a huge thank you for making our stay yet again one to remember! A truly amazing experience.    You cannot be dissapointed with the level or‚Ä¶"
December 2016,Faultless ,"Intimate without ever being intrusive - a very very special place in the heart of London.   Rooms are immaculate with an exceptional attention to detail that I've only seen at the sister hotel (The Milestone) at this price point. The Library Bar (executive lounge) is a superb place to unwind. However, what really sets 41 apart is the team - absolutely faultless and as a result priceless. The nicest, most genuine and caring people you'll meet - Andrew, Florent, Adele, Lauren and the rest of the team are exceptional people. Beatrice Tollman and family have curated an amazing place and group of people. "
January 2017,My First Stay  at 41.  Excellent!,"Having stayed in sister-hotel-next-door The Rubens a couple of times, 41 beckoned as an interesting and special alternative.  I had been spending the festive season with friends and family in Sussex, on leave from my life abroad.  My last night in UK was to be spent celebrating my sister's birthday in London prior to flying out of Heathrow.   I checked in and had a light lunch by the fire in 41's comfortable and welcoming Executive Lounge, together with the very nice offer of a glass of complimentary champagne .  Resting up for the afternoon in a stylish and carefully designed 5 star room, I found everything to be in good working order, all sparkling and clean.   I returned to the Lounge for a pre-party aperitif with superb canapes and croque monsieur.  I chatted to the‚Ä¶"
August 2016,Classic Style I'd say...would love to return‚ù§Ô∏è,"Our first visit to London.  Trip Advisor reviews steered us to Hotel 41 to mark our 40th Anniversary.  Was very special indeed.  Our room had a view of the Buckingham Palace Mews (stables).  Small but suitable and a great bath. The ""reception"" area was lovely any time of day..including 3 am when turning your time around.  The young man offered me a pot of tea and we shared conversation.  Upon arrival you are treated to bubbly, but subsequent beverages are on you.  We enjoyed,the breakfast and snacks.  Location is great for seeing the Palace, parks and nice restaurants in Victoria.  For our budget this is a special hotel stay but you desire a nice boutique feel with service....please stay."
November 2016,Most friendly comfortable and luxurious ,"Hotel 41 is our second home in London. We could not ask for more accommodating staff, great location , great atmosphere , comfortable rooms. Perfect. We come back again and again. Breakfast is delicious. If it's not on the menu, they will make it for you. Lots of good restaurant in the area. The staff is excellent in booking restaurant ms for you. "
December 2016,Stunning Hotel & Outstanding Service,"This really is a great hotel very near Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station (District/Circle underground line). The staff are exceptional and cannot do enough to help you regardless of what you need. The rooms are small, but really well decorated and have everything you would expect. The main reception/dinning room is excellent and is a great place to start any evening having a few drinks before heading out. Location wise its great for getting around London and seeing the sites."
December 2016,Royal treatment by psychic staff and Plunder-the-Pantry!,"My wife and I have stayed in many hotels all over the world and, when in London, usually stay at boutique hotels in Mayfair. We had learned of Hotel 41 when staying at a sister hotel, The Chesterfield, where they recommended that we visit Hotel 41 in anticipation of a future visit to London.  Some have been more lavish; however, this is a hotel where the staff carry the day.  The staff-to-guest ratio is probably the highest I have experienced and they seem able to anticipate every need, even communicating guest particulars (eg, activities, questions, preferences) among themselves.  The multinational (and multilingual) staff seemed genuine in their friendliness and sincere in their welcome.  While the hotel is in a fairly busy area, across the street from the Royal Mews, and a‚Ä¶"
January 2017,Most Romantic Anniversary,"We chose to come back from New Year's in Paris to stay in Hotel 41 for our 20th Anniversary and couldn't be happier.  They consistently outdo themselves with every stay.  We were greeted in our upgraded room with an anniversary cake.  That evening, they lit the fireplace and scattered rose petals and lit candles in our room for turndown.  I should also mention that for our dinner, they got us an 8pm reservation in the most romantic room of a restaurant that some wait months to get (and they did it one week before our trip).  I can't rave about this place enough - we refuse to even consider any other hotel in London."
December 2016,Superb service,"Our first Hotel 41 experience was simply wonderful and exceeded what were already very high expectations. It began even before our stay with support and ideas about possible evening entertainment. Our visit began with a warm welcome by the doorman and some hot chocolate and friendly conversation at the ground floor reception, before an effortless, champagne-pampered check-in on the 5th floor and the wonderful surprise of a suite upgrade. We enjoyed a variety of delicious inclusive food and snacks during the day and had a relaxed evening plundering the pantry in front of the fire in the lounge, before a beautiful romantic turndown and a great night's sleep in a surprisingly quiet room. Our stay concluded with the best full english breakfast I've ever had (highlights were the‚Ä¶"
December 2016,Perfection,"Our third time back at Hotel 41 and it was, again, wonderful. From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel so welcome. We were greeted with champagne and although we were very early for check in, the staff still managed to prepare our room, ready for us to settle down straight away. This was our first time staying in a junior suite and it was lovely! We loved the separate living area, the bedroom upstairs and the spacious bathroom. It was sheer perfection.   After fairly busy days in London, it was lovely to come back to the executive lounge and spend our evenings there. We throroughly enjoyed plundering the pantry and sampling the different drinks on offer.   The one thing that made this hotel so special were the staff. They were all so attentive and we liked that they‚Ä¶"
November 2016,Surprise birthday weekend,"We stayed at Hotel 41 last month for one night as a surprise for my husband's birthday. We had a wonderful time - all of the staff are so friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble. I had mentioned when booking why we were coming and we were surprised to find a delicious and beautiful-looking birthday cake waiting in the room when we arrived.   The room itself was comfortable and spacious but the fireplace made it feel very cosy. I had ordered the romantic turndown as a surprise when we got back from dinner which was a lovely extra treat.  All of the food at the hotel was very good - I almost wished I hadn't booked dinner as we were too full to plunder the pantry in the evening! Having told a couple of the staff on arrival that we had tickets the following day to see the‚Ä¶"
December 2016,Speechless... In a good way!,"Amazing stay. Such a quaint place! Customer service and attention to detail could not be faulted at all. My partner proposed to me in the conservatory suite and it couldn't have been more perfect. He had liaised with the hotel staff who he provided a romantic turndown service. We were even brought a ""congratulations"" cake afterwards! Plundering the pantry was awesome and staff were so friendly. I did struggle without a full length mirror in the room, and the pressure of the jacuzzi bath was very variable and fluctuated. Still, I couldn't have asked for a more special place to get engaged. The icing on the cake was the lovely plant that was delivered to our home today from Hotel 41, congratulating us on our engagement. It's thoughtful and personal touches like this that have made‚Ä¶"
December 2016,Short Christmas holiday in London,Our second visit as we just had to return.  Great location to explore central London.  We love the lounge area. Have Steve make you a REAL martini with some great conversation.  This is a very private hotel so very peaceful and elegant.  Not for children in our opinion. When  you finally go to sleep you'll appreciate the wonderful linens and comfortable beds.  great service.   A must try
January 2016,"No better hotel on earth, genuinely!",This Hotel is truly special. The service from the staff is absolutely incredible. They were absolutely amazing from the second we stepped foot in the door to the moment we walked out. You are made to feel like a millionaire and the price of the visit is worth it. Magnificent.
December 2016,Trip ,Amazing trip found this hidden gem the best way by word of mouth. My partner loved it we would definetly return and stay for longer next time. Maybe even a full weekend away with the girls! Great location 
December 2016,Perfection ,"My husband and I stayed at hotel 41 for our 3 year anniversary and we couldn't have asked for a better place to celebrate. Whilst booking they were so helpful allowing us to check in early because we had lunch reservations. Upon arrival they were so friendly and helpful, champagne on check in with nibbles by the fire, so romantic. When we got to our room we had chocolates and a little cake saying 'congratulations' which was so cute. Taxis were all booked for us, they even made sure we had an umbrella because it was raining. The late night buffet was just what we needed after the  Theatre with hot chocolate at the front door too. It was the best place I have ever stayed in. Every customer gets treated like royalty. So caring, generous and helpful. You will not be disappointed‚Ä¶"
December 2016,Superb ,"Thank you hotel 41 for being attentive whilst providing a personal and professional balance of individual needs, all requirements are catered for without being over bearing.  Staff are outstanding, positive and upbeat and enjoy the task of ensuring all guests are comfortable and enjoying your stay with them. My husband had a coughing bout which was noted by a member of staff, Dominic suggested hot water, ginger, honey and lemon to soothe his cough. Which was promptly served to our table, this gesture of utter attentiveness goes towards their guests feeling welcomed and cared for.  One note of criticism, which I have not marked the five star to four as it can improve with a little elbow grease (which I have commented directly to the hotel).  All in all I would suggest if you want‚Ä¶"
October 2016,FAULTLESS!!!!!,"The attention to detail in this property is amazing.  Trust the pictures that you see, it is absolutely amazing here.  The staff, accommodation, everything is completely and utterly brilliant and it can't be praised enough.   Highly recommended. All the staff were exemplary..."
October 2016,Outstanding!!,"My Fianc√© (well he is now) and I stayed at Hotel 41 on 27 October and we couldn't have asked for a better experience! The stay was part of my proposal and the staff, particularly Florent, couldn't have been more helpful. In the lead up to the stay they were in communication to get things organised and told him he could contact them 24/7.  The hotel is absolutely amazing, down to all the little details from the champagne on arrival, to contacting the restaurant we were visiting in the evening to confirm our booking, to the little treats left in the room.  When we got back to the room after a celebration dinner our room had been decorated and we had been left a bottle of champagne and a congratulations cake (again organised by the wonderful Florent!).  From the moment you arrive‚Ä¶"
November 2016,Outstanding London Hotel,What makes a stay is the service and support that you receive from the staff. This is the best hotel experience. We stay here often. Wish we had one of these hotels in the states. Great location for tourists. Updated rooms and many extras.
November 2016,What an amazing hotel!,"My husband and I stayed here for our 10th Wedding Anniversary, from the moment we stepped into the building we were made to feel so welcome and special by the excellent staff and beautiful surroundings. Quite honestly I could go on and on about how wonderful this hotel is but to keep it simple- champagne check in /constant supply of complimentary snacks/ lovely rooms/ fantastic staff-friendly, attentive, nothing was too much trouble. For us the feeling that we were somewhere special and yet made to feel so at home, is why we would love to return in the future!  For a bit of perspective we also stayed at the Shangri-La Hotel in The Shard this weekend- this was also a lovely hotel with a beautiful room, fantastic city views and friendly staff. But if you asked my husband or myself‚Ä¶"
November 2016,Wonderful ... but,"This is a special hotel, small and intimate with staff attending to your ever whim.  If you book direct you get  a ¬£50 credit, although I didn't notice till checkout. We stayed with our grown up son and booked two executive king rooms, felt they were on the small side and every surface was taken up with 'information' making it difficult to put your own belongings anywhere, a bit too fussy for us.  The rooms were immaculate and well maintained, the beds comfy and even a hot water bottle at turndown. The 'centre' of the hotel is the executive lounge which doubles as the restaurant, bar, meeting area and check-in.  Food which is included in the tariff is available all day.  It's very pleasant but doesn't provide an intimate area, as at anytime people can be at the desk checking‚Ä¶"
September 2016,Perfect!!!,My husband and I had a great time at the hotel. The young receptionist was very welcoming and our room was huge (London is famous for not offering very big rooms)  The toilet was shiny and fancy. Will definitely ho back!
November 2016,Excellent,"We have had a recent stay at the hotel for my husbands birthday. Lovely 5 star hotel which is conveniently located to see the main visitor attractions. The hotel staff are attentive to your every need with nothing seeming to be any trouble at all. Attention to detail is exquisite and well thought out and executed. Wide choice range for breakfast and snacks.  Our room was big enough for the two of us, was comfortable and clean. We have experienced many a turn down service in different hotels over the years but this one was special so well done.  We will return a gem of a place well done"
November 2016,Hotel 41,"World class 5 Star luxury, white marble floors with black inserts, dark wood doors and accents , beautiful plants and lobby with lavish furniture. The staff is professional and knowledgeable on everything about the hotel and the city. They have restaurants, shops, gym, suites, jr. suites. I had a room it was on par with the size of rooms in US. It had white walls, art work on the walls, fireplace, desk, bar, leather chair, TV, mini bar, comfortable bed and quite. The bathroom was well equipped. If you left your room you could go to the executive lounge. If you left the hotel it was a great location in the city, and it was near the tube. I was overnight only on way to a cruse, will never get another stay, it cost three times what I normally pay."
November 2016,Best hotel ever,Never have I stayed in a better hotel.My husband and I stayed here for our 30th wedding anniversary. From start to finish it was fantastic. Not just a hotel but a huge part of our holiday. Hard to drag ourselves away.  Every little detail has been thought of. Staff are welcoming and friendly. Rooms beautiful.   Real 5 star luxury. We won't be staying anywhere else now  Thank you
May 2016,Luxurious rooms and charming atmosphere :),"Couldn't find a single flaw in this hotel. Absolutely recommend it to anyone. The service was really kind, everything was clean and the food was also great! There is no place for disappointment here! Would visit again."
July 2016,Best hotel in Londn,"This is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. The room was large, stylish and beautifully furnished; we were treated like royalty at breakfast, the service were impeccable; a wonderful location and the well appointed bar encouraged us to stay in hotel. This hotel certainly has the formula right."
November 2016,Better than I remembered,"We were torn as to which hotel was our favorite in London, Hotel 41 or Chiltern Firehouse. Unfortunately, my husband and I are still divided. I love both hotels equally, but my husband slightly prefers Hotel 41 because of the incredibly comfortable bed, the complimentary ice cream bar and the best shower in town. That said, I am 50/50 on which I prefer more, but I will say that Hotel 41 is definitely an extraordinary hotel, which I always enjoy staying at."
July 2016,Awesome...,"Stayed at the 41 for 3 nights. The hotel is just amazing. The drinks are a bit $$$, but who cares. No money, no fun!! You can help yourself at the bar 24hr. Never seen this before.  The staff are very friendly and think out of the box. I will return in January to the 41. Keep up the good work."
August 2016,Superb,Amazing g hotel and a real treat. Having only stayed here once I can't wait to try out another room in this stunning hotel. Staff couldn't do any more to be Helpfull! Visually the hotel is just Stunning! 
August 2016,Best Stay Anywhere,"My wife and I took our first trip to London and we stayed at Hotel 41. It was the most pleasant experience we've ever had at a hotel and we certain would recommend staying here. The decor of the hotel is very pleasant and everything worked as expected, but what made this stay wonderful was the staff. Everyone was extraordinarily professional and helpful and went out of their way to make sure our stay was perfect. We'd like to thank Florent, Magdalena, Nicole, Marta, Dominic, Maria, Jonathan, Mathilda, and several others whose names we didn't get for the wonderful experience. It's also conveniently located near Buckingham palace which made it easy to walk to a lot of interesting historical locations and restaurants. It was also easy to get a taxi, bus, or train to any location we‚Ä¶"
November 2016,Second to none!,"Absolutely fabulous hotel and couldn't recommend it more.  Service by the staff from the time of booking throughout our entire stay couldn't have been any more exceptional.  Their attention to detail and making you feel warm, welcomed and valued made this an absolutely unforgettable experience.  This will be our new residence whenever in London."
November 2016,Fab for price I paid ,"Myself and my two daughters came down for a Friday - Sunday stay as a treat For my daughters birthday, staff were friendly , the room was nice  and the service couldn't be knocked at all! the location of the hotel was perfect for anyone after a city stay , and transport was fine ! The only one minor minor issue was the heat of the room and the air con was not working, but the staff were quick to send a fan up to the room which helped matters out strait away! Brilliant all Round and will definitely be using again  A very happy mum! "
June 2016,Amazing hotel,"This hotel definitely enhanced my experience in London. Its design is unparalleled, the service was exemplary, and the dining was truly finest. The location is perfect if you're visiting for the first time.  Will definitely visit again.  "
November 2016,Great great great,Very fantastic  i think i will visit it again and again this hotel is very  elegant  and it make me crazy to visit again and again i advice all to visit  and they will  never regret peace peace peace and love 
November 2016,Outstanding!,"We stayed as a family (with our 2 sons ages 7 and 9) for 4 days from November 3rd - 6th, 2016 to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary. Staying at Hotel 41 literally made our trip. It is in a fantastic location, close to the sights at Buckingham Palace, walking distance to the London Eye, etc. The service was impeccable. The staff knew who we all were upon arrival and made every effort to help us feel at home. We stayed in the Balmoral Suite, which offered the ability for my kids to sleep in an adjoining smaller room. The hotel has an old world charm but offered every amenity we needed. The bed was very comfortable and sheets and towels clean and fluffy.  The lounge was a favorite, we ate there twice a day, breakfast and dinner were delicious and my kids loved ""Plunder the‚Ä¶"
October 2016,fair and nice hotel,"the hotel has a really nice decoration and interior with classic designs and furniture. The rooms are also very cozy, the bed a little too soft though. Reception staff was nice and serviceminded and we had a great stay."
September 2016,We miss the Hotel 41!,"We‚Äôve recently returned from our fourth stay at the Hotel 41, this one for 9 nights.  Incredible hotel with wonderful staff. We miss them all so much!    The location right across the Royal Mews and mid-way between Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station is perfect. The hotel itself is beautiful and has the finest amenities. The Executive Lounge is beautiful with gorgeous woodwork, a fireplace and a gorgeous glass skylight. We are casual people and don‚Äôt feel at all out of place. At night with the candles lit, the ambiance is perfect. Meals are served here as well as evening canapes and then Plunder the Pantry. This feature alone makes a stay at the Hotel 41 worthwhile! Tasty hot entre, breads, cheeses, seafood, salads and desserts are all part of Plunder. The last evening of our‚Ä¶"
October 2016,What a gem!!,"We booked this hotel as a stop over in London on our way to South Africa and because we really like Red Carnation Hotels. We were not disappointed, the excellence of the facility, staff and location were exactly what we have come to appreciate with this hotel group. The lounge was a delight to be used and savoured with a quality of service without compare. We will be back and keep up the very high standard."
June 2016,nice stay in a exiciting city,We had a nice couple of nights at this hotel me and my wife. Breakfast was served in a nice restaurant with cozy atmosphere and the service overall was really great. Rooms could be bigger and the beds a bit softer.
August 2016,"Beautiful decor, amazing staff","We visited for 2nights back in August, the location is excellent and the rooms were luxurious! The staff were very attentive and helpful, for example when we asked for extra pillows and clean sheets they arrived instantly as if they were waiting outside the door. We will be coming back for sure!"
October 2016,One of the finest hotel experiences in the world,"I have stayed in many 5 star and luxury hotels.  Most were memorable and some quite sublime.  Service is the foundation of any good hotel.  I know that sounds obvious but pulling it off is no easy task.  Hotel 41 does ""service"" unlike any place I have ever stayed in and they do it brilliantly!  The staff is friendly, earnest, funny and attentive to your smallest need.  Their staff is always present and ""in the zone"" when they interact with you.  The smallest detail or request is expertly accommodated.  This place is a gem!"
September 2016,Ultimate comfort and great service.,"We stayed for two nights in September.  The hotel's location is excellent, the staff really do care about their guests.  I, unfortunately, was sick on the day we arrived and was given a room to rest while our room was being prepared for us.  This was the best bed, the best bedding, the best pillows, the best shower and bath.... I could go on.   A real treat for us."
October 2016,A place where luxury & privacy both mainatined,"Hotel 41 became one of my favorites on the first visit. Recently I spent 2 nights 1 day there. The hotel is so luxurious and service is outstanding. My room was clean & tidy and in perfect condition, and staff showed excellent professionalism to detail in preparing for my arrival and in housekeeping services every day. Thank you."
October 2016,Very special place..,"An absolutely fabulous experience.  We recently spent 3 nights at Hotel 41 and it surpassed our expectation in every way.  It's a lovely boutique hotel with very elegant and tasteful rooms, but the best part of our experience was the highly attentive and friendly service. Virtually every member of the staff immediately knew us by name, and bent over backwards to insure that no detail was left to chance.  A truly memorable stay."
July 2016,Needs More to be called the best hotel in London!,"There is not question that 41 offers a lot. You are greeted with a choice of champagnes and pastries My room was lovely and the help tried to be accommodating but the concierge had to go to the internet for information, There is food almost all day included in your room rate,.  But I t is hard to determine when you pay for a cup of tea and when it is included. I knew more than the concierge -  no crossed keys. I was given incorrect opening times and luckily I had another place to go. Nobody opens the door or taxi, and if the person at the desk is on the phone and you have a bag you may have a problem getting in. This is related to the Rubens hotel next door, and frankly that has people who are more knowledgeable about what is going on and how to run a 1st class hotel."
July 2016,Amazing Botique Hotel,"Hotel 41 is a luxurious experience. I highly recommend that you stay here. Wonderful, attentive staff and a great location. The library is beautifully appointed and they attend to your every whim. Get the yogurt for breakfast....it is the best I have ever had."
September 2016,Faultless ,Subtle attentiveness from the onset!  There was a fluidity of service which made our stay both comfortable and homely without being over bearing.  Without going into too much detail this was quite simply one of the best hotel experiences we have had to date. We are looking forward to discovering what the sistering hotels have to offer. 
September 2016,Best Hotel stay ever!,We loved every aspect of our stay. We are already planning our return visit. This hotel is worth every penny- we had the experience of a lifetime. The staff was thoughtful and attentive to every detail. We loved one stay and we will be back without a doubt!!
May 2016,Unreal !,Loved this place. Could stay forever. What a beautiful architecture and design within the illustrious corridors and walls. The art deco theme is unforgettable. They also have a lot of history and tour guide books within the hotel for those interested in it.
September 2016,"Five stars, frankly, aren't enough","Simply cannot say enough good things about Hotel 41. From the minute we set foot out of the cab until we left days later, this team of people anticipated and exceeded every thing we wanted or needed.  The rooms are lovely. Beds perfect. Appointments wonderful. It's quiet at night.  The Executive Lounge started and ended every day - with breakfast impeccably prepared and served.  Pre dinner cocktails were relaxing and welcoming.  Special recognition to Steve who leads this part of the experience.  We much enjoyed our quickly developed relationship.  His recommendations for dining were well thought out.  Wine suggestions spot on.  The team of folks who are part of the front desk/concierge are friendly, efficient, thoughtful, helpful. Always available.  Maria & Adele, in‚Ä¶"
September 2016,Totally Perfect,"This hotel would be worth visiting for the ambiance, quality of decor, standard of rooms, superb array of day long treats and food in the lounge alone, BUT should NOT be missed when in London to experience the service provided by the AMAZING staff. Every single person shows exemplary professionalism and provides a standard of customer service not experienced in any other luxury hotel anywhere in the world.  I could write pages giving examples of the above but my title says it all - ""Totally Perfect""! "
September 2016,What a gem!,Had an amazing nights stay - treated my hubby for his 60th birthday ! We were upgraded to a suite which was fabulous! There is nothing to fault about this little gem in the heart of London!   Every member of staff offered a first class service - nothing was too much trouble!  Cannot recommend this place enough - it really is special - you will not be disappointed ! I am saving again and can't wait to visit again but next time for longer !!!
September 2016,Best Hotel Ever ,"Booked Hotel 41 after reading about it in the times some time ago. I wanted a special place to bring my lovely Daughter who has just finished her Masters. They spoilt us from the moment we arrived with champagne. We where upgraded to a lovely Suite. The decor and furnishings totally luxurious. Then began three days and evenings of total luxury and indulgence. The staff are so lovely. I have never come across so many kind helpful and simply amazing people in my life.  Hotel 41 is not just a hotel it's an experience. Full of surprises everything done beautifully. Thank you for the thoughtful touches the congratulations cake. The Harry Potter hats and fruit, the gorgeous Flowers you sourced for me. So many thoughtful details.  And plunder the pantry a grazers heaven.  If you want‚Ä¶"
September 2016,Great Luxury Hotel,Hotel 41 is a great boutique hotel in a great location in London. The service was second to none. We enjoyed having the 24 hour snacks and bar service. Every staff member was well informed and friendly.
April 2016,Perfect Romantic Hotel,"After getting wed on the Southbank I'd booked this Hotel for the evening - not realising after that it was perhaps a little excessive for such a short stay, but it was worth it.  Arriving around 11.30 pm we were welcome with Champagne at the check in and quickly made to feel at home - after dropping off  the bags in the room, we took advantage of the midnight larder, enjoying a nice warm dish and some selections from the meat and cheese boards.  The room was split level and had a nice fireplace, all decked out with fine pictures and nice furnishings through out. Very comfortable room and a cake had been left with Congratulations written on it and scattering of rose petals around the place.  Breakfast in the morning was a veritable selection of whatever you wanted, more‚Ä¶"
September 2016,stunning hotel in london,"I really can't say enough about the quality of attention and service given by the staff.  During my 1 week stay I had one minor complaint about the temperature of the hot water in my room, and they had it fixed by the time I came back from dinner. Excellent hotel .excellent service ,excellent to my trip thanks alot"
July 2016,An oasis of luxurious calm.,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for two nights as part of our Ruby Wedding Anniversary (40 years). From the greeting at reception to the organisation of our departure taxi, amid the chaos of local road closures, everything was perfect.  We arrived just before midday and our room was ready a few minutes after check in and a welcoming drink. We unpacked and returned to the executive lounge for some lunch including a delicious wild mushroom ravioli and  snacks.  After spending the afternoon with our daughter in Richmond and a lovely Italian dinner we returned for further snacks and ice cream before sinking into the large comfortable bed.  Breakfast was freshly cooked and very tasty with lots of choices. Pocket snacks and sweets loaded we were ready for a walk to the British Museum... we are‚Ä¶"
August 2016,The best hotel we've ever stayed in!,"The second you step foot through the door, you know you've made the best decision of your life to stay in this Hotel! The staff are exemplary and nothing is too much trouble (and I don't think we've been called Sir or Madam so much in our lives!).   We stayed at the Hotel as a surprise for my Husband's birthday and from the welcome champagne to the romantic turndown service (which they instead organised for us for when we arrived instead of at the end of the evening) we were totally blown away by it all.   Our room was a King room, the bed so enormous and so comfy as well as the pillows which allowed us a welcome night's sleep away from our children! It was impeccably clean and spacious. We loved the laid back atmosphere of the Executive Lounge with all the wonderful touches‚Ä¶"
September 2015,Nothing is a problem!,"We travel to London quite often, and we've tried many luxury hotels.  Nowhere could you find better service than at Hotel 41.  Everything was superb, but an example of the service is breakfast on our last day.  We had a cooked breakfast included in our room rate, but we needed to head for Heathrow by 6:00 a.m.  We asked if a box of rolls, fruit, etc. could be made up for us to take with us.  The staff member reminded us that we could have a cooked breakfast, but we said we didn't have time.  He asked what time we would need our breakfast and we told him we would have to eat by 5:30.  This was not a problem, he responded, as the chef arrives at 5.  He took our order.  The next day we seated ourselves in the lounge at 5:25 a.m., and exactly at 5:30 a staff member appeared with our‚Ä¶"
July 2016,"Best Hotel, Best Service and Best Hotel Staff Ever","We just concluded a stay of 9 days in this fine hotel. We had stayed at another Red Carnation Hotel in downtown London 6 years ago, but the #1 ranking of the 41 Hotel caused us to book at this fine hotel. We booked a junior suite, which has a main floor sitting room with TV and fireplace and an upstairs bedroom with ensuite bathroom and desk. The junior suite was simply lovely and comfortable. But, what clearly makes this hotel a #1 ranked hotel is the extremely high level of professionalism, service and friendly demeanor of all hotel staff, which were extremely helpful regarding recommendations of restaurants, tourist sites and our questions in general. Of all the hotels we have stayed in, we feel this is the highest quality staff of employees we have ever experienced. 41 Hotel‚Ä¶"
July 2016,BEST HOTEL EVER,great customer service. best hotel i have stayed at in london. From the amenities in the room to the executive lounge they more than exceeded my expectations. Everyone had a smile on their face and went out of their way to help make my trip the best it could be
July 2016,Absolutely amazing,"Hotel 41 was absolutely amazing. The service was top notch.  Rooms were very clean and the staff very friendly and really catered to your every need.  We arrived early in the morning and of course our room wasn't ready that early (9am), so they put us in a temporary room to be able to get cleaned up, nap, whatever while our real room was being prepared. That is what I call amazing service. No other hotel has ever done that. Food was amazing. Breakfast, snack, dinner snack--all amazing. They would also give you water on your way out for your day travels as well as snacks!  The service was impeccable. They knew you by name, which adds a personal touch. Location was perfect and there is a money exchange place about 10 minutes away that will give you THE best rate that I found‚Ä¶"
June 2016,Fantastic Stay!,"During the week of the French Open I had the opportunity and pleasure to stay at Hotel 41, booking two rooms for four days total. I have stayed in London four or five times over the last six years, though this was my first visit to Hotel 41. I can only say my visit was the best I have had in London. The staff was amazing from start to finish. We were made to feel welcomed the minute we walked through the door. The room was exceptionally clean and comfortable. The television remote was a bit hard to navigate, definitely a user issue. :-). Plunder the pantry? - more like plundering a gourmet meal. There was never a need to go out for dinner, the food and treats were exceptional. The seafood pie and the pistachio deserts deserve special mention. I am returning to London next year‚Ä¶"
July 2016,The best little gem in the world!,"I have traveled to London before, but the one place I wanted to revisit and introduce my son to Hotel 41.  I had a visit there earlier with my sister and daughter. I believe it is a place that one has to experience in order to understand how truly special it is.  It is not just a hotel. It is a place you can call home - a place to relax, a place to unwind, and a place to feel uniquely special.  The salient feature is the staff.  They are efficient in their job, caring, and personnel. I always look forward to seeing one of the managers - Florent.  He exudes warmth, passion for his job, and true interest in his guests. He always makes us feel so special and my son noticed it right away. I barely mentioned how my son't birthday was coming up in a few days and me arranged a‚Ä¶"
July 2016,Unique,"Simply the Best. If You want personal 24 hour service in unique envinroment, this is the Place to go. Staff is just for You and You only. Near everything You want to go in London. Just ask the Staff, they will fix everything for You.. Be relaxed and enjoy Your staying."
July 2016,Game changer! ,"We have just spent the most perfect two nights at Hotel 41. From the moment you step out of the cab the whole experience is amazing. The staff are truly unbelievable, friendly, helpful, engaging and will go the extra 100 miles for you. We were made to feel really special for the whole stay and this is an experience we will never forget. We were treated to the master suite with an incredible glass ceiling, lounge area and dressing room. Unbelievable! The hotel lounge area is like being in a cosy, seriously well decorated livingroom and the pantry is like a dream! We had an amazing few days exploring the city and found ourselves really looking forward to going ""home"" as we called it! This is what this place is like...a home away from home. Perhaps we will sell up and move into‚Ä¶"
August 2016,Amazing Service ,The service at this hotel is phenomenal with the staff making you feel like a regular from the first minute you arrive. The food and location are also great with the only minor drawback being the small rooms. 
August 2016,Best Hotel in London,"Hotel 41 is by far the best hotel in London! If you are looking for top notch service, a stunning room, excellent staff and amenities this is the hotel to stay at. Right next to Buckingham Palace it boasts pure elegance and is close enough to everything you want to see. I will definitely only being staying here the next time I am in London!"
February 2016,In a different league  !!,It really is a cut above the others that I have visited.  The service is outstanding from start to finish.  Welcomed with free Champagne on check-in ( choose from a menu with all high end bottles on offer ) then showed to the room which had 3 bathroooms. The complimentary pantry is a nice touch in the sitting room  as was the bottle of chilled  champagne awaiting us in the room on our return from an evening out. A special visit to a special hotel.
September 2016,Wonderful anniversary and birthday celebration,"My husband booked a weekend at Hotel 41 for my birthday and our first wedding anniversary celebration. It was magical. The other reviews describe it perfectly - impeccable service, lovely rooms, amazing rooms. The pantry was awesome. The value (I think) is excellent because you get lots of complimentary treats. The Penhaligon toiletries were divine, so much so that I went to the store to buy some the next day. Unfortunately they are made especially for hotels...oh well, looks like I'll have to book another stay! Thanks to all the staff, especially Mitch who was super friendly and always remembered our name."
August 2016,First trip to London,"We chose Hotel 41 for our first trip to London and we couldn't be happier with our decision. This hotel was perfect for our family. The accommodations were impeccable and no detail too small. The employees went out of their way to make each of us feel comfortable and special - every single day for nearly two weeks! Andrew supplied our 11 year old daughter with Dr. Who details. Several staff members enjoyed talking Harry Potter with her on a daily basis. Once we returned home, we missed Stefan's stories as well as Edgar's late night drinks and company. We are still talking about the friends we made at this hotel. It's just that personal. We've never stayed any where quite this special - except for maybe home. "
September 2016,Worthy of It's Number One Rating,"I can't really say a lot more to emphasize this place is perfect as a small hotel.  Elegant, beautiful, outstanding service, great location.  Rooms are gorgeous.  Staff is friendly and fun, much more so than their stuffy competitors, The Connaught and Claridge's.  Entrance is a bit obscure and we had sort of a hassle unloading our rental car in front because of construction cones blocking the front entrance.  Go. Enjoy."
August 2016,The Best Hotel in Town,"For style, service, fine wine, excellent dining, perfect location, comfort, exclusivity and total spoiling of the dogs this hotel can't be beaten.  We will certainly be staying again and can hardly wait."
September 2016,Simply devine,"After a trip around australia with my mum, returned to a new life in London and whilst awaiting our apartment to be ready spoilt ourselves with a stay at 41.  Just spectacular!  The hotel is just beautiful but it is the service that is standout.  A pleasure to be addressed by your first name when coming by staff, attention to detail is amazing.  Rooms are specious and the use of the executive lounge was a bonus.    I will miss my home in Sydney and weekends away in the beautiful HunterValley but with hotels like this nearby- I will certainly be taking some regular  Fabulous London urban getaways at 41.  "
September 2016,Retirement surprise for my wife ,"It's hard to pick out highlights from a 2 night stay that was a continual highlight. Everything was faultless. The level of service was something I hadn't experienced before.  The warmth and friendliness of the staff was outstanding (in particular, Adele and Andrew, and Siobhan and Frank from The Rubens).  If you want to experience the best, stay at Hotel 41.  "
February 2016,Just wow. Live live a star ,This hotel really has it all if you want to feel pampered. Yes it's very expensive I booked in advance and my room was still ¬£350 for a night. However don't let the price put you off. The finishing touches are immaculate and it really feels like being on a movie set. Also the added extras like snacks and so were nice. Staff were very helpful and I didn't come across anyone unwilling to help 
July 2016,A True Gem especially for people who love quiet,"We prefer staying at boutique hotels and this one is the epitome. The staff is exceptional. It was the best choice we could have made.  The bed was so comfortable and the bathroom was spotless and beautifully white.  Florent (Flo) helped us with reservations including Alain Ducasse. He was a valuable asset to us on our London leg of the trip.  The best part of this hotel is stepping off the busy, energized and loud London Street into this beautifully quiet cocoon. "
July 2016,There and Back Again..... with trophies!,"After a gap of several months while recovering from my surgery, we happily entered the portals of 41 to a warm welcome home.  We stayed in a delightful room with easy access for (my temporary) disability, sitting area and a bathroom with low (for wheelchair) fittings, walk-in shower and adjustable support rails for the loo.  We were not going anywhere on this visit.  We just needed to be pampered and that is exactly what happened, as always.  Our arrival champagne was to hand, and we had a short rest in the bedroom before emerging to join residents in the Executive Lounge for evening drinks and canapes, which were delicious.  An extended chat with long-standing friend Stefan, and a visit from the GM, Malcolm Hendry ensued, and then we chose items from the complimentary Raid the‚Ä¶"
August 2015,A fantastic place to stay!,"Or room (a suite) was just wonderful and relaxing, the location is great, and the staff was the best!  The lounge is a great place to have afternoon tea, or dinner and was great for prepping to go out!"
July 2016,Worth the splurge!  Can‚Äôt wait to return,"We had an absolutely wonderful one-night stay at 41 at the end of our 2 week UK vacation.   My husband and I have demanding jobs and are rarely able to take time away, so when we vacation, we really like to splurge on relaxing experiences.  We felt so pampered from the minute that we entered 41!  We knew from the hotel description that this would be wonderful, but we were really extremely impressed with the whole experience.  The entire staff at this hotel are extremely warm and friendly ‚Äì genuinely so, and not just putting on a show.  You are greeted by name by all the staff, and I was amazed that they all remembered details of our conversations, and would ask how we enjoyed the activities or meals that we experienced during our stay.  We were offered a glass of champagne on‚Ä¶"
July 2016,Hidden gem,"Great place to stay with fabulous service. The luxury starts from the moment you arrive with a lovely welcome. Special mention to the lovely Andrew and his brilliant conversation, made us feel at home. Afternoon tea was a scrumptuous delight and the lounge was a great place to relax. All the staff that we met were brilliant and made us feel at home. Highly recommended "
June 2016,Best Service and Staff Ever!,"We stayed here a couple of weeks ago for a week, because my husbands' bucket list was Wimbledon. The staff here was the best ever from any hotel we have ever stayed at. We have stayed at many Four Season's resorts and have to say that the staff here was even better. Adele and Stefan and Florent went so far above and beyond any expectations. The breakfast with Stefan was always the best and his personality was so refreshing every morning. He always had great advice for us. For dinner Adele and Florent and the rest of the front desk staff was always so happy to help us and what we wanted. They always had great recommendations for us. We loved staying there. The food was always the best. I loved the breakfast tea and the tea any time of the day. From now on anytime we go to London,‚Ä¶"
June 2016,An outstanding experience,Hotel 41 is one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at.  The staff were very gracious and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable.  The location was very centrally located.  I would almost go so far as to say that it was worthwhile to visit London just to stay at the Hotel 41.  Thank you for a wonderful stay.
June 2016,"Lush, plush and totally wonderful","I've stayed in many hotels, world wide, in my life but Hotel 41 was by far the nicest experience ever. It was obvious the staff really enjoyed their jobs and that enthusiasm showed in their pleasant attitudes, whether it was early morning or late at night. The attention to detail was fantastic... but best of all... BEST of ALL... were the Lindt lindors you could have all through the afternoon and night! My favourite chocolate ever! Oh yes... if you love quality, good service and chocolate, then this is the place for you!"
July 2016,Fantastic place to stay while exploring London,"It was our first trip to London so after reading the rave reviews of others we went for Hotel 41 - wow. It was perfectly situated near Victoria station, and I can only echo every other reviewer in our praise for the staff and hotel itself. We will be trying to perfect the signature pre dinner toasted sandwich snack until we are lucky enough to return. The staff were great at recommending things to do and places to eat. Tip - absolutely book tickets to the Book of Mormon while in London, amazing show. We will see you again next year! "
July 2016,Outstanding....,As friends were getting married in London we decided to make a long weekend of it. We spent ages looking at hotels and kept coming back to 41. Not cheap but amazing reviews and ideally located. So we decided on 41. Boy are we glad we did. Absolutely amazing service from the minute you arrive until even after you have checked out. After a short flight down from Edinburgh and a hot trip on the Tube from City Airport we were warmly met at the front door by the concierge who was expecting us and welcomed us by name. Great start which got even better. Left our bags which later appeared in our room. We were shown up to reception where the first question was.... white or rose champagne - bliss.  Our room was even better than we had anticipated. On the first night our room was turned‚Ä¶
August 2016,Consistently Outstanding ,"This particular trip was unusual in that we had a few minor problems during our stay but so well were they handled, even this  experience merely highlighted how the very high standard of customer engagement by all staff at the hotel set create the type of differentiation that capital investment in the facilities alone cannot create. Florent, one of the front of house team rains a great asset to the hotel."
August 2016,"Stellar Hotel, Stellar Staff","If you are looking for old world charm and service, this is the hotel! #1, it is gorgeous. Black and white flooring and carpet, huge leather chairs, a library which has a buffet bar with lovely finger snacks and amazing  desserts. You will be greeted and have the door opened for you by wonderful staff. You will be treated with champagne upon check-in. Your room will have a lovely fruit tray, every morning and a paper in whatever language you choose.(upon request, which they inquire about upon check-in) There was always a little gift on the bed every day, sometimes a beauty product or a candy of some sort There are candy bowls at the front desk and also water bottles you can take as you head out to see the beautiful city ofLondon. The staff is SO wonderful; they all felt like‚Ä¶"
July 2016,Unadulterated Luxury,"The moment you reach the door of Hotel 41 you know you are in fora luxurious experience. From the warm greetings at the door to the attentive front desk staff on check in everything went really smoothly.  Our room was gorgeous, with deep soft pillows and the comfiest mattress I have ever slept on. The Hotel is only a 5 minute walk to the nearest station and there are lots of amenities close by.  Because we had reservations elsewhere we didn't eat here."
May 2016,Luxury all the way,"The hotel is very luxury with a lot of important details to be in perfect condition in comparison with other good hotels, were we have stayed. They take care of everything so much that you feel that you have to do while youa re there. It is a nice place to visit at least once when visiting London, as the price was quite, although we stayed only two days."
July 2016,Prepare to be stunned!,"Prepare to be stunned indeed, as soon as you enter this extraordinary hotel you will get the wow factor straight away.  Very near Buckingham Palace you yourself feel like royalty in these grand surroundings."
July 2016,Live like a Queen,"Hotel 41 will impress from the moment you are greeted at the door. Stayed here for two amazing nights in London. Make sure you put some time aside to enjoy the executive lounge. The room was perfect, can not fault the hotel and all the staff. Made my stay in London fabulous. Great Location. 8 minutes to the nearest train station. Hop on/off bus stop directly outside hotel. 30 min very easy walk to some great sites. If you have a special occasion or just want to splash some hotel 41 will not disappoint."
August 2016,Welcomed back like old friends,"If you ever need to feel special and have an amazing couple of days away , look no further than hotel 41, set next to Buckingham Palace , in the centre of London , the moment you walk through the doors you are treated and made to feel like a member of the royal family ,   Nothing is too much trouble and from the room cleaners through to the management of Lauren you could never bet made feel more special ,  Steve in charge of the daytime drinks etc is a star explaining how and what goes into your cocktail or letting you know where to eat and drink or socialise in the city,   Thanks again and we will definitely be back ."
August 2016,Wonderful Boutique Hotel,"41 Hotel is right behind Buckingham Palace and it is well situated for walking to any location in Central London. The hotel is small and intimate. As such the staff know you from when you step inside the small lobby. All rooms are on the same floor with a hub called ""The Executive Lounge"". This is the where breakfast is taken, and drinks, snacks are constantly available. The concierge staff are truely wonderful to deal with. Restaurant or tour reservations were made with aplomb."
August 2016,Anniversary delight,"My husband and I spent our 11th anniversary here, while watching the cricket at the Oval.  It was a wonderful stay.  The rooms are spacious and clean, complimentary snacks in the lounge and the staff were second-to-none.  They were highly attentive: addressing us by name, asking about the match, and couldn't do enough for us.  Despite being hard-working, they also took the time to chat and make us feel welcome.  Plenty of friendly banter with Andrew in particular! We would love to come back again soon."
August 2016,Wow!,"My wife and I were staying over two nights in London at the conclusion of a Baltic cruise, and I wanted a nice hotel to enjoy.  Reading reviews on TripAdvisor, I selected Hotel 41.  Best decision I ever made.  This hotel is AMAZING.  Not only is the location perfect (across the street from Buckingham Palace and two blocks from Victoria Station), but the lodgings are exceptional in size and furnishing.  Our room was the largest hotel room we have experienced.  And beautifully furnished in quality fixtures and a lovely black/white palette.  The executive lounge is open 24/7 and provides complimentary snacks, along with breakfast and complimentary evening munchies.  If you want to REALLY enjoy London, include a stay at Hotel 41 on your itinerary.  And the prices are not‚Ä¶"
August 2016,Amazing from start to finish,"My husband and I booked the 'Night to remember' package in honour of our wedding anniversary and birthdays as a romantic break. From the moment we were sat down in the executive lounge with a glass of champagne to register, until we were loaded up with water, sweets and an extra cake to take home and share with our young children when we checked out, the hotel exceeded every expectation.   This hotel has managed hit the nail on the head in every single area. The rooms and lounge are decorated beautifully without being ostentatious, the atmosphere is relaxed even you know you are staying somewhere really special and the staff are extremely attentive without being intrusive. The food in the plunder the pantry was absolutely wonderful, and the extras we got as part of our package‚Ä¶"
December 2015,Fantastic experience,Where do I start this hotel is just incredible from the luxury rooms to the attentive and friendly staff stayed here in December 2015 and wasn't sure what to expect. From the moment we arrived we felt like royalty such a beautiful place with excellent staff that couldn't do enough for us . Champagne on arrival chocolates and cards in our room we where up graded to a junior suite which was beautiful. After spending the evening out we returned to our room to find the fire lit and classical music playing slippers layed out by the bed and night cream on the pillows this place is very special. Throughout the day you can graze on canap√©s fruit and snacks which are fab all included with your stay we even had hot white chocolate given to us on our way out for a morning walk this hotel‚Ä¶
August 2016,Treated like royalty,"My husband and I are trying to remember a time we've ever been so taken care of.  We've traveled to some of the best hotels all over the world and have yet to find a place that made us feel so over the top luxurious, yet so warm; much like staying in someone's home.  The staff is phenomenal, the rooms and accommodations cozy and chic, and all the treats and food divine.  We cannot wait to return.  We find no other reason to stay anywhere else in London."
August 2016,Boutique Beauty,"If you are looking for awesome customer service, location, impressive decor you are looking in the right place. Our 3 night stay at Hotel 41 delivered all this and then some.  We had a 2 story king bed suite and it was so sophisticated.  This hotel is on the 5th floor of a building attached to another hotel and an excellent restaurant. The Executive Lounge on the 5th floor is bright and warmly decorated just as you would expect of a British living room.  The ""bbar"" restaurant next door has wonderful food, drinks and very cool decor.  Service here was just as great at next door at Hotel 41.  Another great feature is the location, right on the back side of Buckingham Palace.  Nice walking distance to some many pubs and super people watching.  Would definitely recommend this hotel‚Ä¶"
August 2016,"Amazing location, amazing service","If you like a full-service experience, this is your place. Wow. I've never experienced anything like it. They offer service beyond compare: want tea outside of the normal hours? Want your bags packed before you leave? Want your car brought around, gassed up? We didn't test them, but as far as I could tell, there was nothing (legal) this staff wouldn't do. They were so friendly, to us and to our kids--and so ridiculously helpful. Oh, and that afternoon tea is amazing. They even have gluten-free scones. Breakfast buffet wasn't big, but had a wide variety of things. Don't come to this hotel if you are looking for big hotel service (impersonal). This is a relatively small hotel, located on one floor of a building (with an entrance on the street level). Gorgeous interiors.‚Ä¶"
August 2016,THE BEST HOTEL IN LONDON,"My First impression of this hotel is the staff , they will ""WOW"" or more than ""WOW"" you!! Then when you settle in the room the ambience of the room, preparations made for you, welcome gifts, cleanliness, products & everything else in the room are just exceptional. The ""WOW"" service starts from the moment you book this hotel until you leave the hotel. The location of this hotel is very central and walking distance to everywhere. It is a definite that i will come back to this hotel as they are so call ""THE BEST IN LONDON"" in my hotel stay list. It is rather weird that i don't feel sad to leave London but i am sad to leave Hotel 41 during my departure back to Singapore. All travellers out there if you are looking for an accomodation in London this place will ""WOW"" you!    Regards,‚Ä¶"
August 2016,Best of the Boutique Hotels,"This was the first time we brought our teenage girls to Europe and feel Hotel 41 set a high bar for future visits.  The rooms were relatively large with beautifully appointed black and white decor.  Neither room had much of a view (we had interior courtyard rooms), which didn't matter since we were out touring during the day.  What sets this hotel apart from any other we have stayed was the SERVICE!  This hotel should be a template for every other hotel to aspire.  First, there is a front door/lobby that is always locked and requires one to be buzzed in.  It is right across the street from Buckingham palace so the area feels very safe.  The rooms are on the 5th floor, which is the top floor, so you ride the elevator up to be checked in and led to your room.  Since there are no‚Ä¶"
August 2016,Beyond Expectations ,"I knew from previous postings that the service at Hotel 41 was going to be superlative. What I didn't expect was that our experience would be the best three night stay we'd ever had anywhere in the world. We arrived from the US after a long, tedious flight, almost two hours in customs, and a driver from a car service who decided not to wait for us and left us stranded at the airport.  We walked into Hotel 41 tired, cranky and disheveled at about 10:00 am, and immediately everything changed. Our bags were taken for us and we were guided into the executive lounge where we were made to feel as though we were the only guests in the hotel, or at least the only ones who mattered. We were seated in comfortable chairs and immediately offered a choice of four lovely champagnes, including‚Ä¶"
July 2016,"Great hotel, amazing staff","It's not just the comfortable beds, soft linens, fluffy towels, excellent coffee and countless other amenities that make this a great hotel.  It's the remarkable staff.  From the moment we ""checked in"" we were treated to warm, greeting smiles.  Check in isn't what you typically experience in a hotel.  We were escorted to the 5th floor where we sat in comfortable chairs and discussed what we wanted to see and do.  Somewhere during that time a credit card imprint was taken.  We enjoyed champagne and snacks while we planned our activities.  The restaurant recommendations were spot on as was their suggestion that we tour Buckingham Palace.  The staff at the 41 truly enjoy what they do.  We'll be back."
August 2016,"Still Exceptional at ""41""","It was 2 years since we had our first memorable stay at Hotel 41.  Back then we wrote about getting what you paid for...which was a very attentive staff and attention to detail and it being worth the ""splurge"" though you could easily do math to justify it not being that much more expensive than alternatives for what is included.  Today I am writing from my Hotel 41 room before we leave after a short 1 night layover prior to a longer vacation.  This update is even more positive than our 2014 visit.  After 25 years of travel, we had the misfortune of our airline not having our luggage join us on our international flight.  We were facing a 12 day vacation with nothing but the clothes on our back!  Clearly not the way to start a trip.  The 41 team didn't seem to care this was a 1‚Ä¶"
May 2016,Exceptional stay,"Hotel 41 truly is amazing.  It is a lovely boutique hotel with elegant rooms, wonderful linens, outstanding amenities, and the best executive lounge I have ever experienced.  I would have been pleased with just this, but Hotel 41 is so much more as well.  It really did feel like the entire staff wanted to make our stay truly remarkable--and they did not fail!  The staff go out of their way to provide their guests with the highest level of service; nothing is too much trouble.  We asked them to acquire a SIM card for us and it was waiting for us on our arrival--so nice that we didn't need to search out a 3 Store on our own.  Every time we came back to the hotel we were greeted by name.  The breakfasts were delicious. I looked forward to them every morning.  Afternoon tea was‚Ä¶"
May 2016,Magical,"We have stayed in many 5 star hotels across the world, but this little gem in London is by far the best.  From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave (begrudgingly) you are treated like the most important guest they have staying with them.  Our 2 night stay was for the Queens garden party and there were a few things we needed in preparation. My husband wanted a pink buttonhole and a wet shave on the day of the garden party. Not a problem. An appointment was booked for him at Trumpers in Mayfair (along with transport) and his buttonhole was delivered in pristine condition ready for us to leave. Nothing is too much trouble.  The executive lounge is the heart of the hotel and an absolute treat. Stefan and his wonderful stories are not to be missed and he along with all of‚Ä¶"
May 2016,Faultless,"I have never been so enamoured by a hotel. Everything about this hotel was perfect from start to finish. I would love to give feedback for what they could do better next time or went wrong but unfortunately or fortunately depending on how you look at it, I have nothing to say. You will not regret staying here. I will rave about this hotel for a long long time. Staff are pure professional excellence. Every hotel manager from all the hotels I have ever visited need to stay here to understand what 5 star truly means."
September 2015,heaven on earth!,the loveliest  location and  the best service along with finest amenities....It makes for a dream holiday stay. The rooms are well equipped and the bathrooms luxurious.  The central space  serves wonderful breakfast and great cocktails in evening
June 2015,Exceptional stay!,Everything about this hotel is brilliant. The location is perfect across from the Mews and allows for easy access to central London. The service here was truly one of a kind and they did everything they could to ensure every aspect of our stay was the best. The penthouse room is a DREAM!! The glass ceiling both day and night is like nothing you will find again! We cannot wait to go back again! Thank you for making our anniversary stay the best! Side note...there is a lovely Sri Lankan restaurant right around the corner! So good!
May 2016,41 is Number 1. All staff take a bow,"We first stayed here 10 years ago. It was super then and is super now.  This really is a fantastic hotel, with the best team of staff that I have ever come across in any organisation. They really were something from a by-gone era when Britain was renowned for it's service. There were absolutely no ""weak links"", so it would be unfair to single out any individual. I would suggest that the Employee of the Month Award would go to the Team.  Sumptuous surroundings, every last detail taken care of. Everyone went out of their way to make me and my wife feel so very special.  What a shame we could only stay for 1 night as we had to be home for my Mother's 95th birthday. We were down in London for a visit to a Buckingham Palace Garden Party and, although we were catching the train on the‚Ä¶"
May 2016,Home from Home,"The staff and service at Hotel 41 is what makes the stay so enjoyable. As the hotel is quite small all the staff know your name, they remember your plans and then are keen to ensure that you had a good time. Our room was quite small but it had everything you could possibly want and need. The beds are huge and extremely comfortable. The shower was the best power shower I have ever been in! The executive living/dining room is just like a very comfortable, well appointed front room - with free ice cream, hot and cold snacks and a great selection of alcohol available. The service is friendly and unfussy. Location-wise the hotel gets full marks as well, being just 20 mins walk from Piccadilly Circus and 10 minutes from Kensington & Chelsea - and the Queen as your near neighbour! We‚Ä¶"
May 2016,There is a reason,There is a reason to visit again and again and the reason is the very simple fact that this hotel has service so well worked out that you just feel like you are in the hands of a welcoming family. This was our third visit and we were no less well looked after. We had an executive King room and this was more than adequate and very well appointed. The 'pantry' is a marvel and I ate extremely well from it on the Friday night even to the extent of having a beer with my curry. I know I could have been in a curry house doing the very same but the infused service just made this all the nicer. We will be back once again later in the year. Is there anywhere else like this? It doesn't matter because this works just perfectly. 
May 2016,Simply impeccable!,"My husband, daughter, and I stayed for 3 nights at Hotel 41 last week.  Everything about this hotel is IMPECCABLE:  service, location, food and drink, rooms, cleanliness -- I could go on and on.  We had reserved a junior suite but were thrilled to be upgraded to the Balmoral Suite upon arrival.   We received a warm welcome from Adele at check-in where we were provided complimentary glasses of champagne while waiting.  She also graciously made dinner reservations at Caf√© Murano for us while we were checking in.  Our suite was spotlessly clean, beautifully laid out, and supplied with best-in-class amenities.  Even the smallest detail - like a really good hairdryer! - was top-notch.  I can't say enough about the staff.  They are completely professional but so charming and friendly.‚Ä¶"
March 2016,OMG just simply isn't enough to describe this property,"I have traveled a lot in my lifetime and there are no words to truly describe our recent stay (March 2016) at this Hotel.  From the moment we arrived until the moment we left, we were treated like royalty.    I would have to say that the Hotel 41 was the best hotel, ever.  Ever!  Amazing service, amazing location, amazing staff."
June 2016,Sublime!,I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this hotel :) the staff are brilliant! Their attention to detail is unequalled! They always look after us without us asking.  It's our home away from home always :)
September 2015,Best in London,"We stayed here for 3 days and were amazed by the service, just splash out and do it. Fantastic suite with a very relaxed feel.  Lovely staff that do there very best to look after you. I can only repeat what many others feel and say. If you want to be spoilt, this is the place."
June 2016,Never had this experience!,"Sometimes you just HAVE to have that experience of a lifetime and this is it!  From the moment you walk through the door to the moment you leave; it is 5 star service all the way.  Starbucks delivered upstairs while we unpack; complimentary paper, tea, snacks in the morning, snacks in the evening, jars of candy by the front door, bottles of water.....the list just goes on and on.  The staff never seems to sleep or need it because they are always there smiling and trying to anticipate your every need.  We want to thank Stephan and his staff for a totally memorable experience-and then there was London:)"
June 2016,Great nights sleep,A very comfortable stay with all business needs taken care of quickly and efficiently - many thanks for looking after us and ensuring that all requests and visitors were dealt with discreetly. I highly recommend room service - but be sure to ask for Damien; he was excellent.
June 2016,Suite Time at 41,"Hotel 41 in London remains one of my worldwide favorites and certainly the best in London. Two things set it apart--service and compact luxury.   The hotel is rather small, occupying only the fifth floor of 41 Buckingham Palace Road.  When you arrive, you are greeted at the main floor entrance where you will be directed to the elevator and the Executive Lounge. The library-like lounge serves as the check-in area as well as the dining room and bar. Its warm tones and upholstered furniture make it the perfect place to relax.  41 provides complimentary afternoon snacks and a late night raid-the-pantry spread in the lounge. Each time I stay, the late night snacks seem to get more varied and tastier. Thick-sliced Serrano ham, seared tuna tartar, shrimp cocktail, Stilton cheese,‚Ä¶"
June 2016,Perfection,"The number of hotel beds available in London is overwhelming. I made my choice by ranking hotels (using their websites and reviews) using three parameters. Location. Inclusions (wifi, breakfast, gym). Room comfort (size, noise levels, cleanliness).  Three hotels had equal scores so then I used price to make my final choice - Only two nights, without family, this was a big event! Hotel 41. To begin - welcome emails, invitations to arrange restaurant/show bookings, and a pre-arrival information sheet to personalize my room for my arrival.  To follow - I arrived at 7.30 am after a 33 hour commute. I was greeted with such warmth and a strong coffee and nursed through to a courtesy room to use for as long as I needed however I needed. Bottles of sparkling water were pushed on me,‚Ä¶"
June 2016,An Extremely Lovely Hotel,"There isn't much we can say about this lovely hotel that hasn't been stated many times by other guests.  It truly lived up to and exceeded our expectations.  We want to send a special thank you to Stefan and Patrycja who made us feel like we were staying in someone's home.  They always enquired as to how our days of sightseeing had gone and what they could do to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.  We could not have been made to feel more special.  The plunder the pantry, evening canap√©s and fresh fruit in our room everyday were delightful. We will definitely be staying with 41 Hotel on our next trip to London."
June 2016,Hotel 41,I cannot say enough about this hotel.  The entire staff was very professional and helpful.  The lobby area is as comfortable as sitting in someone's living room.  The accommodations are excellent.  It a great location within walking distance of many attractions and also close to public transportation.  Would love to stay there again
May 2016,Absolutely Amazing Hotel,"This is by far my favorite hotel. My husband and I first stayed 2001 and my last visit in May was just as enjoyable. The staff is so wonderful and genuinely pleasant.  They go out of their way to see that your stay is the best possible. I have stayed in many hotels around the world and I am always drawn back to 41. This is a different hotel style. Some people prefer the large hotels but this is more like a club floor feeling, which I prefer.  Food and beverage selections are outstanding. I loved just relaxing in the lounge area and chatting with the staff. The rooms are perfect for my needs. My favorite room looks out toward the royal mews.  Location couldn't be better.  Several times I have taken private tours (many good local tour companies) but also used the hop on hop off‚Ä¶"
June 2016,Better service than Buckingham Palace.....,"If you wish to feel like Lord and Lady Grantham, then this is the place for you. Service from another era. Highly recommended.   The gold standard of service and responsiveness against which every other hotel will be judged. Simply could not have been better.   They quietly go about trying to accommodate every wish and whim almost without you realizing it. My wife ordered bacon and got something that looked more like ham (British style bacon.) Before we knew it a quiet concierge had googled bacon and realized there are actually four kinds, British, Streaky, American and Canadian. They promptly brought out American style bacon.   Stephan Otto felt like my personal friend and butler for our one week stay.   I could go on. For the penultimate service experience go to the 41."
May 2016,BEST HOTEL ON THE PLANET!,"I have never written a review of anything on Trip Advisor but feel compelled to let everyone know how fantastic Hotel 41 is.  The staff is simply unbelievable.  They are welcoming, gracious, friendly, funny, and took care of our every need.  The accommodations were beautiful but it was the staff who made our stay extraordinary.  We felt like royalty.  They know who you are when you come in, you never sign for anything throughout your stay, they keep track of everything, they provide anything that you need and more.   They booked tickets for us for a show, made reservations for high tea.  I can't list all the things they did, but the staff is just incredible and made our stay in London a perfect 10.  My husband and I both agree that it was the best hotel experience we have ever‚Ä¶"
May 2016,Superb hotel,"  Having spent 2 x Nights at Hotel 41,Buckingham Palace Road,London,myself and my Wife would like to express our Sincere Thanks and Gratitude to all of the Hotel 41 Staff for their Excellent Service and Attention to Detail. Our stay was thoroughly enjoyable indeed,the Accommodation,Food,Staff,Housekeeping and Overall Ambience were Genuinely 5 Star. We very much look forward to a return stay in the near future.  Regards, Mr & Mrs B Concannon. "
March 2016,super stay in super hotel,"We have just returned from a 2 week stay in London!We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.  We were upgraded on arrival, everything is spotlessly clean, staff extremely pleasant and always helpful. We were eagerly anticipating this trip based upon the previous reviews we had read and we were not disapointed!"
May 2016,Only wish I could add more stars to the rating!,"We just arrived home after our stay at Hotel 41 in London and haven't stopped talking about it.  I was a bit disappointed when I returned to my own home to find that there was no pantry to plunder or rose petals on my bed or filled candy dishes & fresh fruit in my room or friendly faces wanting to grant my every wish...but that is what made Hotel 41 so special!  Everything was so amazing during our stay, I even believe the staff had something to do with unusually sunny weather we experienced.    We stayed in the Balmoral Suite and had trouble deciding between one of the THREE showers to use each day.  Did I mention the candles and aromatherapy pillow spray at turndown? There isn't a detail that Hotel 41 hasn't implemented.  Since we know we will return and I will most definitely‚Ä¶"
November 2015,Just as I remembered!!!!,My first visit to Hotel 41 was two years ago with my sisters and mom for a very special birthday weekend for my mom's 70th Birthday - and everything was perfect as I wrote in an earlier review.  I loved Hotel 41 so much that I returned with my 2 teenage children and husband this past November for Thanksgiving week and we had a WONDERFUL TIME!  We booked two rooms that were across from one another with a door that locked to the outside - they were as adjoining as much as any European hotel could be.  Both rooms were wonderful and just as my prior visit - everything was perfect!!!! Hotel 41 is special and anyone who has stayed there knows this!  They treat their guest like royalty and even better - like family! If you want large rooms and a bustling hotel this would not be for‚Ä¶
May 2016,Welcomed like old friends,"We returned for our fourth visit to 41 and were given such a lovely welcome by Lauren and her team.  This really is a very special place.  If you are looking for a large, busy hotel with spa/gym facilities etc., then this is not for you.  However, if you are like us and enjoy a small, intimate boutique style hotel where nothing is too much trouble and you are made to feel special, then head to 41.  Yes it is an expensive treat, but you more than get what you pay for and the care and attention from everyone is just amazing.  We had a lovely surprise when we were upgraded to the Monarch Suite overlooking the Palace Mews - just perfect.  It was lovely to meet the new members of staff who were all absolutely lovely and delighted to see a fellow Glaswegian, Andrew, on board.  This is‚Ä¶"
May 2016,Exceptional service,"Had a 2 night weekend stay. Service was first class. Nothing too much trouble and everybody really friendly. Champagne on arrival a lovely touch and the larder is great for a snack any time of the day, though in the evening it's effectively a full meal - we had steak and ale pie on the second night. Go on -treat yourself..."
May 2016,Made to feel at home.,"I first came across Hotel 41 through the reviews on trip advisor. After viewing the hotels website we decided to book the conservatory suite. We wasn't disappointed!   The staff are great. I cannot fault them. Everyone was very friendly and couldn't do enough for us. They have the perfect mix of being there when you need them but leaving you to your own devices.   After seeing some of the reviews on trip advisor I was slightly dubious as to whether the hotel might be a bit pretentious but I didn't find it that way at all. It was very relaxed but classy all the same.   The room we had was spacious and had every amenity we could think of. We loved the glass roof, the large shower and bath. Not forgetting the huge and very comfortable bed.  The staff booked us into a very nice‚Ä¶"
May 2016,WOW!,I booked this months ago for my husband's 'big' birthday and for a surprise day/night out in London. The hotel staff were fantastic from start to finish - I emailed them initially enquiring about the packages they offered. The communication was brilliant as my original package changed when Billy Elliot closed in April. From the moment we walked through the door the staff were amazing - I have never been anywhere like this and we have travelled to 5* + hotels abroad.  I cannot thank them enough - our stay was amazing. They upgraded us to the Master Suite (conservatory roof) and the room is fabulous - we wanted to move in! The pantry is amazing too and the food is so fresh. Breakfast was brilliant and although I can rave on I really think the staff make Hotel 41 the place it is.‚Ä¶
May 2016,"Thank you, Mrs. Tolliver!","We chose Hotel 41 for an anniversary vacation and it was a wonderful experience. The hotel is beautiful, intimate, and staffed by the nicest people you will ever meet on a trip. They helped us with theater tickets, dinner suggestions and reservations, and surprised us with a lovely anniversary cake upon arrival and candles and rose petals decorating the room one evening. The breakfasts and snacks were bountiful and delicious and we loved sampling different British gins every afternoon. The beds and bedding are luxurious and guarantee restful sleep. The best part, again, is the staff. They were unfailingly friendly and helpful and I hope to be able to go back to this lovely place next year!"
May 2016,excellent!!!!!!,"a luxury hotel with confortable modern rooms!!!! The stuff was very helpful and professionals and the location was perfect, close to the sub!The breakfast we had at the hotel was of a very high standard!! Totally perfect!!!!"
June 2016,"Stunning rooms, fantastic service and an experience you will never forget!","We stayed at Hotel 41 as part of our honeymoon in London based on the reviews we read on Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed. We were led up to the executive lounge, the main heart of the hotel. Here we were given a welcoming glass of champagne to sip on whilst the set up of the hotel was explained to us. The lounge is absolutely stunning and feels so comfortable. The hotel has complimentary snacks such as ice cream, sweets, popcorn, crisps. This changes to cheese and meats and even desserts during the evening. The hotel has an honesty bar which sums up the whole feel of the hotel. Guests are trusted to log in a book any drinks they have helped themselves to from the bar. As a guest at this hotel you really do feel at home - just a far more luxurious version of home!  As part‚Ä¶"
May 2016,An exceptional staff and property!,"We stayed at the Hotel 41 for 10 days on our second visit to the UK.   Our experience upon arriving at 10:00 pm to our departure 10 days later at 6:00 am was the absolute best.   The staff, from the concierge, to the executive lounge team, to the management, are amongst the finest we've experienced after traveling throughout Europe.   The staff is very attentive, helpful, engaging (personal touch which is much appreciated while traveling), knowledgeable and most important they are all very warm and genuine.    We stayed in a junior suite and was so pleased with the accommodations.  The historic details in the room, combined with a ""western"" size bathroom and amazing shower were a plus.     The Executive Lounge was open 24 hours and you had a full pantry of treats and drink‚Ä¶"
June 2016,"Charming team,first class accomidations","We were so fortunate to find hotel 41 for our recent trip to London. The room was luxurious,location perfect,and staff totally charming professionals . After an injury occurred they treated us like family. That is only true if your family is really good to you!! We will never stay anywhere else if they have an available room."
June 2016,Hotel that never ceases to amaze ,This is a luxury boutique hotel with rooms in a monochromatic palette. The main social area is the executive lounge.   This hotel is absolutely fabulous in every aspect. You will not regret a stay here and you will want to come back. The personalized service is utterly perfect. 
June 2016,Best in London,"We arrive in this paradise with some of my friends. The Rooms is big and comfortable, clean and with nice art decor. The staff is very help full and nice. We have our best time in London. Fantastic position, very close to the sub way and the tourist attraction. "
May 2016,Reality exceeds expectations!,"We stayed 3 nights at this hotel last week and had a wonderful stay. I picked the hotel because it was ranked #1 and our stay exceeded all expectations. The rooms were wonderfully appointed and we were surprised when we had rose petals on the bed at night without asking.   The location was a perfect base for sight seeing. And the staff was willing to go out of their way to accommodate any request you may have.   The best part of the hotel is the executive lounge. This is a beautiful room that they keep stocked 24/7 with free (and delicious!) food. They even have a small fridge full of ice cream. We came from the USA so we were a little off in our time and ended up at the lounge every night around 2:00 - 3:00 AM. I would like to give special thanks to Ivo, who is the night‚Ä¶"
May 2016,Relaxed and quiet with impeccable service. A real treat.,"A fabulous couple of days at this delightful hotel, where the staff look after you as if you were a special guest in their own home. We were made so welcome without any stuffiness or pretentiousness. The room and lounge were so comfortable and the food delicious. We can't wait to find an excuse to go back!"
May 2016,Superlative. #1 for a reason,"We have traveled to a number of wonderful boutique hotels across the world and I am usually not impressed with the usual offerings of sweets in the lobby, turn-down service, etc...but this hotel is truly OUTSTANDING in customer service and deserves special mention. It is rightfully in my opinion #1 in London on TA for a reason. Why? Because, quite simply, they listened and went above and beyond. You know how you get that red eye flight from the US over to Europe just so you can arrive at some unGodly hour in the morning? We got in at 7:30 am from Raleigh. I always dutifully fill out the ""guest questionnaire"" beforehand and generally expect it to arrive in the trash heap. What I requested was perhaps use of a common bathroom to freshen up a little as I knew our room would not be‚Ä¶"
May 2016,A week in London,"What a great experience! so much to say about a weeks stay in London - the ENTIRE staff at Hotel 41 goes 'above and beyond' to make sure the stay is not only enjoyable but memorable. Breakfasts were soooo good. Book the room/stay to include and you will not be disappointed. While rooms were a bit small our upgraded too room suite, with two bathrooms gave us ample room. We quickly learned we packed too much so lesson learned. Located a block from Buckingham Palace, the Victoria Train/Tube station and within walking distance from restaurants and shopping on the West End make this an ideal location. When in London again, no hesitation on where we will stay!"
March 2016,"Beautiful hotel, quite unusual - but a few disappointments!","We stayed here in March, for my husband's 60th birthday, it was a surprise treat for him that I'd been planning since November, so I was very excited when I gave him the details the week before. When you arrive, the area downstairs is quite small and you are taken in the lift up to the 5th floor where, when you exit, you enter the hotel properly and wow what a wonderful place, the lounge area absolutely beautiful with it's conservatory style roof and stunning decor. When we arrived the staff were very friendly and attentive and Adele showed us our room where they'd left petit fours and a lovely chocolate birthday cake for my husband. We stayed in room 4119 for 2 nights, it was beautiful and laid out over 2 floors - very unusual. We had booked the BBar restaurant for the 1st‚Ä¶"
May 2016,Amazing luxury in the heart of London,"Hotel 41 is a wonderful intimate hotel in an excellent location, convenient to everything yet quiet and peaceful. Neither flashy nor loud, Hotel 41 is a perfect refuge with a refined, welcoming atmosphere. Every staff member we encountered was congenial and professional. My room was beautifully decorated and very comfortable; Wi-Fi worked great.  The guest lounge area is the best set up I have found in a luxury boutique hotel, it was lovely and elegant, and we were so impressed by Stefan, the primary host, who was beyond exceptional. My triple cappuccino also awaited me each morning.  After working and walking all day, my colleague and I enjoyed cocktails and snacks each evening in the guest lounge - just divine. Now that we have stayed here, we can't imagine staying anywhere‚Ä¶"
May 2016,"If you want to feel like home, this is the place to be !","We were at the Conservatory Suite under a roof in glass. From you bed you can see the birds fly over...what a lovely experience. But, concretely : the beds are wonderful, the bathroom is spacious with rain shower, regular shower and jacuzzi, there is a separate room to sit and enjoy a drink. Coffee and tea can be made. Breakfast is nice and is being served in a british/south african like lounge room. There is a buffet serving hot and cold dishes that you can plunder for free. Additionally there is ice cream that you can grab and a wide variety of drinks. If you want to be pampered and feel at home in a big city, than this is the place you want to be. Enjoy like we did !"
May 2016,A fantastic find in London,"London is a difficult and expensive place to find a good hotel. Look no further than Hotel 41. Carved out of an old-fashioned hotel across from the Royal Mews, the 41 offers impeccable service, lovely rooms, well-appointed baths, and a family-like staff. The Executive Lounge -- akin to a lobby, but as intimate as a traditional London club -- has comfortable seating, an ongoing supply of food, and a convivial atmosphere.  The perfect place to retreat from the hubbub of the big city, whether you travel for business or pleasure."
May 2016,The BEST,"The hotel is small, but perfect. Rooms are decorated beautifully and have everything you might need. Food and drink is always available in the Executive Lounge which is the perfect place to relax before and after exploring London. The food and drink selection is excellent. The location is great too. The absolute best part of the hotel though is the staff- service is top notch; they are so friendly and helpful, willing to go above and beyond, and delightful to talk to. Hotel 41 is instantly one of my favorite hotels and I've stayed in many! Can't wait to go back!"
June 2015,Great Hotel!,"I have stayed a the hotel a number of times now, the hotel is excellent, clean and tidy, staff were extremely polite and helpful. Highly recommend....  In terms of value for money, this hotel is amazing."
May 2016,exceptional stay,"The hotel is lovely, rooms are comfortable and the staff and atmosphere are excellent.  The hotel provides a cozy lounge for breakfast and for cocktails, It is an absolute pleasure to stay at this hotel."
May 2016,First Visit to London!,"Top Service.  Friendly!   Food Drink always available.  Helpful staff.   I thought the Suite would be fun, but my knee did not like the full staircase from the sitting room to the bedroom. Beautiful treats left out for us each night.  Great cocktails in the Lounge for extra $$.  Champagne Bar next door.  Across from Buckingham Palace.  We easily walked to the Irish Guards' Museum."
May 2016,Very lovely.....,"My wife and I stayed for one night at 41, our first visit here, on a very rare evening away without the children!  Even though it was just a short stay for us it really was the perfect choice for a special and romantic night away.  The staff were all so friendly and attentive but never intrusive.  The service felt very personal and it is clear that the hotel takes great pride in ensuring its guests feel looked after and valued.    The Executive Lounge is a great place to just unwind and chat over a glass or two of something chilled.  It's also really rather fab to return to after a night out with its wonderful choice of complimentary snacks to enjoy before bedtime!  We'd absolutely recommend if like us you want somewhere special, peaceful and romantic."
May 2016,Amazing! Just amazing! ,"Me and my wife came to London for our week holiday and this hotel was recommended to us by a friend. It doesn't make you feel at home, it makes you feel like you don't ever want to return there! Prices are more than reasonable for a room with this kind of quality, always bright and welcoming. The staff makes it all the better. We had an amazing time in this place. It made our holiday so much better. A must go! "
April 2016,Truly Outstanding ,"My daughter and I stayed at Hotel 41 for 5 nights this week.  First, let me say, that the quality of the staff here is unmatched.   Everyone was so helpful, friendly and always remembered our names.  Even my 13 year old daughter was impressed (no small feat!).  We loved the lounge in particular.  The location of the property is perfect.  It is central to everywhere you want to visit and very close to Victoria Station.  To give you an idea of the exclusivity of Hotel 41, even the London cabbies need help finding it!!  Side note:  Nathaniel's negroni's should be added to the permanent cocktail menu!!  Cheers.  "
March 2016,My new favourite place to stay in London,"What a find!! Smallest 5 star hotel in London I believe but big in stature and customer service. Staff are all wonderful couldn't possibly single one out. Cocktails, food and snacks  all excellent quality and plenty of them."
April 2016,Just brilliant - believe the reviews!,"This is my first ever review but our trip to Hotel 41 definitely warrants me taking the time to post a review.  We have stayed in many 5 star hotels but this hotel definitely delivers on personal friendly service.  From the moment my husband and I arrived we were greeted with warmth, friendliness and also a complimentary glass of champagne- happy days!  We had booked an Executive King room but to our surprise we were upgraded to the Conservatory Master Suite which was set over 2 levels and was gorgeous.    The Executive Lounge is quaint and very welcoming and we just had to take advantage of the complimentary afternoon tea consisting of warm scones, jam and cream.  The complimentary pantry is well stocked and we were actively encouraged to take whatever we wanted.  After drinks‚Ä¶"
March 2016,Wonderful anniversary stay,"This hotel is just perfect. I cannot think of a single thing that could be improved!  The staff are friendly, efficient and thoughtful but low key. We really enjoyed talking to them. My husband really connected with one of the staff, Steve Jones and thought the world of him.   The Executive Lounge where business is taken care of as well as having meals there was beautiful and so tastefully done.  It became our second home while we were there. We had most of our meals there as it was so convenient and the food was what you expect  in a higher end restaurant.   The location was really handy across from Buckingham Palace. It is a  three minute walk to Victoria station then you can go anywhere in the city on the tube. Taxis are plentiful when needed and the hotel is more than happy‚Ä¶"
March 2016,Perfect,"Wow!!! This hotel is absolutely perfect...where do i start? It has a very good location. And From the minute we entered we already knew that we made the right choice. The hotel is very clean and stylish. We were brought to the lounge area with free food, dessert, drinks and impeccable service from the staff. They made me feel right at home. The staff seem to have this ability to know and deliver all your needs in style and cheer. The bedroom was amazing, we didnt get a suite but the space was more than enough for all our large metal rimowa luggages and carry on luggages. It was very well decorated and the bed was very comfortable. Airconditioner was good and works even in winter i think. Television was fantastic with over 100 channels. For those that sleep in late curtains are‚Ä¶"
April 2016,Mr,"Expectations of a 5 star hotel is already there, hotel 41 deserves them all, environment, design, food everything is superb, but there is one thing what thous it all, The Staff!!!!! Never had such a service in my life. All of you from check in to cleaning congratsüíêüëäüèº simply the best If you want a small luxury hotel stay here and I promise you, you will enjoy your stay It feels like family who wants to take care of you I will return to you!!!"
March 2016,"The best hotel in London, and the Planet.","We stayed at the 41 for 8 days, and every day things would get a little better. The staff notices what you like throughout your stay and they start doing it for you. For example, if they notice that you turn the AC on during the night. They start doing it for you.   Another thing that is great about this hotel is the service, and the people. Andrew was an excellent chap. He recommended the best restaurants which we loved. Everyone was so nice and very helpful to us.  Mr. Jones was also great to us as he bought me some Haribo sweets with his own money because he thought I would like them. Tea in the executive lounge was one of the most enjoyable things to do in London.  This hotel is not very expensive, it is small and exclusive and it has great rooms. It beats other hotels which‚Ä¶"
March 2016,Amazing stay for our first wedding anniversary!,"We stayed here for two nights on the 23rd March as part of our 1st wedding anniversary celebrations. I had been wanting to stay here for a while as it is no.1 on tripadvisor, and after staying, we can definitely see why it is no.1!   Like so many others have said, the service is simply outstanding. All the staff were brilliant, for example, on check in, they knew our names, loved the handwritten welcome card in the room, I had a gift for my husband delivered to the hotel directly as it would not arrived in time otherwise, and the staff had safely kept it until our arrival...they remembered what type of coffee and tea we prefer at breakfast...anytime we asked for something in our room, they delivered it so promptly...helping me locate our uber taxi as I couldn't figure out the‚Ä¶"
March 2016,Best Service Ever,"Recently stayed for three nights.  While the rooms are nice, what really separates this place is the service, which is the best I've ever experienced at a hotel.  The staff strikes a terrific balance of being friendly and attentive without being intrusive.  The lounge (called the Executive Room) is also a wonderful feature, much like having your own Club in London.  Will definitely stay again."
March 2016,Amazing start to the honeymoon!!! ,"We do not know where to begin.  There's not enough words to describe the service and hospitality we have received.  We checked in after a very early start to day absolutely shattered after a long wedding weekend! We were both keen to begin our most awaited honeymoon.   The staff knew who we were as soon as we walked they greeted us and knew that we were newly weds! The personal service this hotel and it's staff provide is out of this world! Walking in to the hotel, or walking in for breakfast there is always a smile to greet you as well as the staff addressing you personally by your name.  Staff are always on hand - no request seems to big for them!   The two nights we spent there was a surpise for my new wife...she thought she was going to a Holiday Inn for two nights! The‚Ä¶"
November 2015,Elegant hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 days. Located next to buckingham palace, it is in a quiet neighborhood. Small boutique style hotel. We loved it. Very good service that totally pampers you. We had a two level suite that was small, but comfortable. It was located directly next to the dining area. You entered and on the first level was a small living area with tv and gas fireplace. Up a narrow stairway was the king bedroom and bath. The bathroom was luxurious with a bathtub and separate shower. I only wish the toilet had its own room. The ceiling height in the bedroom area could be a problem for some. Seemed very low!   One restaurant in the building. The food was very English, which was what we wanted. They also own the hotel next door and we frequented that bar as there was‚Ä¶"
March 2016,No clich√© here; abundantly exceeded any expectations,"There are addresses, materials, looks, and then there are people. We oftentimes forego the persons and impress ourselves on things alone. This hotel thankfully opts to focus on the former, not that it lacks any of the latter. And for that I have no option but to rank it well above various of its more pompous competitors, including traditional ones like the Connaught and the Goring. The level of attention to detail is simply unrivaled. Congrats friends at 41, the attitude is what distinguishes you; altogether an A team. JP and I thank every one of you for one very memorable stay."
March 2016,"Exclusive, friendly, super comfortable","We travelled as a family during easter 2016. I had reserved the hotel as a surprise for my hsuband, whose 40th birthday we celebrated. I could not have picked a better hotel anywhere in the world. All the arrangements before our travel went smoothly and I found everyone on the staff very helpful and attentive towards my wishes. On arrival, everyone greeted us warmly and knew the names and ages of our boys by heart. We were led to the executive lounge where we were served champange and soft drinks and a very beautifully set up table with various ""snacks"" (the word does not honour the very high quality of everything that was served). Our rooms were perfect, during evening turndown the fire was lit, radio played sof music and there were warm water bottles in our beds. We enjoyed‚Ä¶"
July 2015,The BEST hotel in London,"Undisputably the best hotel in London. This place deserves every 5* review it gets. I would actually argue that it's worth visiting London just to stay here.  Staff are attentive and observant, and understand exactly how much to engage with each guest. They are incredibly knowlegable of the local area and are always willing to arrange a table etc.  There's food on offer at all times, all of the snacks are free and you can help yourself whenever you want. Breakfast is fantastic, and very competitvely priced (always opt for it if you have time).  Rooms are well furnished, and have plenty of space - even in the standard rooms."
March 2016,Believe everything you have read,"The darling wife and myself have just spent the most wonderful, relaxing and spoilt weekend, courtesy of the staff at Hotel41.   The service is beyond brilliant, but what makes it so good is the way that it is done in such and understated and subtle way. Two examples to explain this. Firstly, we had the most wonderful afternoon tea on Saturday. The tea was wonderful, but the fact that staff knew I needed more hot water for the teapot without me even asking was something else. Secondly, for our trip home the staff gave us a little 'goodie bag' to tied us over. We sat on the train and opened the box and found that they had packed it with the goodies and snacks that we had taken from the pantry during our visit. My wife had mentioned in passing on the Friday evening that she found‚Ä¶"
March 2016,The ultimate 5 star experience - go now!,"Our stay was perfect, and we would definately go again. The staff were the most proactive and friendly staff that I have ever experienced. They seemed sincerly  interested in us as persons, and was of assistance whenever possible. They knew our needs before we knew them ourselves. The Executive Lounge of the hotel (which all guests have access to), provided the perfect place for relaxation, a pre-dinner snack or a romantic breakfast. The room was so beatiful, that you didn't wanted to leave (see pictures on hotel home page). Our room was in perfect condition. The bed and the pillows were nice, and the soap and creme on the bathroom from Penhaligon lifted the bathing experience to the next level. We would not consider any other hotels in London for a romantic getaway."
October 2015,Loved staying here.  Very thoughtful details throughout and really friendly staff.,"Definitely worth the price due to the quality of service, beautiful and comfortable rooms, yummy food and perfect location.   It is on the top floor and very quiet too.  The concierge is very helpful with up to date events and attractions."
March 2016,An oasis in the bustling capital,"A stone's throw from the hustle and bustle of Buckingham Palace, this hotel occupies an ideal city centre location. From the moment we pulled up outside and the hotel staff immediately arranged to valet park our car with a minimum of fuss, we knew the service provided here was special. It is easy to miss the entrance to the hotel as it does not declare its presence with gaudy show but, like most boutique hotels, has an understated entrance. On entry, once we had been introduced to a charming young man named Andrew, we were ushered to the 5th floor and to the check in desk. Here we were greeted by another delightful member of staff and offered a glass of champagne from a selection on the trolley. The staff are what sets this hotel apart. They strike the right balance with guests.‚Ä¶"
March 2016,Awesome hotel in every way possible,"I am just back from London after 4 amazing days with my wife and family. One of the reasons it was so great was because of Hotel 41. All the things that one would expect from a hotel that advertises itself as a 5-star boutique are there. The room was spacious and well adorned (we actually had 3 showers in it), the food and lounge were great and the staff were friendly, attentive and genuinely willing to do everything they could to make our stay memorable. But moreover the intangible little things really set this place apart.  You cannot go wrong staying at Hotel 41 in London."
March 2016,Absolute perfection - top notch service!,"Our stay here was absolutely fantastic.  It's a small boutique hotel - and the staff is really superb.  The room was on the smallish side but it doesn't matter because it was perfectly decorated, cleaned wonderfully and the little touches are what makes this place fantastic (nightly turn down service; amazing bath products; free water and snacks all day/night).  At one point I sneezed and a member of the staff nearly tripped running up the stairs to make sure I had a tissue - the staff truly goes above and beyond at all times.  We've stayed at five star hotels all over but the staff here makes you feel really pampered.  We really can't say enough about this hotel and have absolutely found our forever London hotel.  We will return for sure.  We only gave our name once when we‚Ä¶"
December 2015,2nd stay for new year!!,"Stayed here in November initially, then booked again to stay for 4 nights starting New Year's Eve,  just when you think it cannot get any better... It does! We arrived at the hotel to be greeted like returning friends! We got to our room to find a nice bottle of bubbly waiting, We stayed in New Year's Eve and enjoyed the flowing drinks, cocktails also. We then went up on the roof to watch the fireworks on the London eye, really nice touch. Special mention to Adele, she asked us if there was anything she could help with, I said we was thinking of visiting a spa, somewhere with a pool. 5 mins later she returned having found a perfect spa for us, she booked this and printed off directions if needed. Very fast service nothing was too much trouble for her. We bumped into Andrew also‚Ä¶"
February 2016,Amazing,"We picked this hotel as it was number 1 on trip advisor, and I can see why!  From the minute we arrived the staff were brilliant, checking us in with champagne and port.  They could not do enough for us.  Location is perfect easy access to the tube. Some lovely restaurants nearby. We dined at a local Italian that the hotel staff recommended and booked for us.  The bedroom had everything that we needed. The food we ordered as room service was delicious. Full English in the morning was also superb. Throughout the day and night snacks were put out, in fact by the time I went our for our evening meal I was not hungry!  Highly recommend this hotel for special treats and indulgence üòâüòâ"
February 2016,"Stay at Hotel 41, London","We have stayed in this hotel as couple i.e. my wife and myself , father and son football trip. On both occasion the stay was excellent. In our family we have named this hotel as home way from home. The rooms are excellent and there is value for money compare to other hotels in Europe. The staff are excellent and amazing. They always go beyond excellent customer service. Everyone seems to enjoy doing their job hence this transfer to the staff excelling in their job. The moment you walk in into this hotel you are treated like a King or Queen. I don't know how they do it but the Red Carnation group hotels  (Oyster Box, Hotel 41 and 12 Apostles )that i have stayed in  have excellent staff. The hotel location is excellent and close of UK kingdom palace. There is also cosy lounge‚Ä¶"
March 2016,Perfect yet again!,"I love this hotel so much! It's perfect for our annual romantic London getaway.   The service is second to none the rooms are luscious with lovely fluffy pillows (they give you a choice). Its like being in Alice in Wonderland with all the black & white decor.  My favourite part is returning after a night out, sitting in front of the fire in the executive lounge and helping myself to a cheese plate a drink from the honesty bar. It is only small so you rarely see any other guests.   I can't wait to return and it will be less than a year next time!"
February 2016,Amazing Service,"We booked this hotel due to the reviews on TripAdvisor - and wow, are we glad we did.    We were in London for three days to celebrate my 50th Birthday and the staff at the hotel did everything to be as helpful as they could.  From the moment we walked into the hotel with the welcoming chilled champagne, to the moment we were reluctantly sent on our way at the end of our stay with a hamper of goodies from the snack bar, we cannot fault the staff or the place.  The quality of everything in this hotel is fantastic - the rooms are spacious for London hotels - the location a few minutes walk from Buckingham Palace - the free snack bar a welcome change from having to pay for every morsel you consume - excellent choice of beverages all at reasonable prices for a central London 5 star‚Ä¶"
February 2016,Excellent! ,"Theres something to be said about good customer service and this hotel certainly has that. EVERYONE we came into contact with was very hospitable, attentive, polite and assertive.  Although its rather open plan and cosy in the main dining room (Executive Lounge) it has that certain charm and relaxing feel to It that makes you want to just wind down and enjoy the free champagne and nibbles. Hotel itself is very clean and has many nice touches and little extras. Well worth a visit, even if for a night!"
February 2016,"Honestly, amazing","This hotel is honestly amazing. The service is impeccable, friendly, relaxed. The staff truly seems to enjoy their work, and that makes is such a pleasure to be there. I'm a writer, so I usually try and avoid over-use of adjectives, but seriously, this hotel is great.  At one point, I was working in the lounge, and one of the staff got me an extension plug so I could work by the fire. I happily worked for 2 or 3 hours, while eating lovely food and drinking one of the best Rose wines I've ever had.  There was a major flood, totally unrelated to the hotel-- a water main broke on the street, and that night, the internet was down while I was trying to check into my return flight. I asked about it at the desk. Didn't really mind, as I was able to go to sleep instead of working more. ‚Ä¶"
January 2016,A gem of gems,"In short, you feel instantly as if you are amongst friends. The staff is attentive and very service minded. Absolutely loved it. This has to be one of if not the best hotel I have stayed in of all my visits to London. The location is very close to Buckingham palace. I will return again and again"
February 2016,Simply amazing,"We stayed here over my birthday, and I can't even explain how amazing this hotel is, the hotel itself is truly luxurious and the staff are excellent! They done every thing they could to make our stay perfect without being too much! The perfect amount of attention. From the Champagne on arrival to the 'plunder in the pantry' to the room service everything exquisite! We didn't want to leave! All the extra touches to a birthday cake to a birthday card and even a little present! Everything was wonderful and we enjoyed every second! I want to thank all the staff who made our stay the best! We shall be definitely returning. "
February 2016,Outstanding Hotel,"Is it really that good? ""YES""  Hotel 41 is found opposite the Royal Mews on Buckingham Palace Rd.  The outside doesn't look very grand compared to other well known hotels, but the looks are deceiving.  Once inside a very smart lobby you'll greeted by a member of the team who quickly whisk you away to the lounge to be checked in.  Welcome champange was a loverly treat whilst filling in some paper work and told about the hotel and it's plentiful supply of treats.  The room was truly amazing.  A massive bed, everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel and more. Some really nice touches' that made us feel special.  Loved the turn down service.  The hotel in centred around the lounge area which to my taste felt like a old Englishman's  library/smoking room.  Nice leather sofa's,‚Ä¶"
February 2016,A true boutique,"Hotel 41 is a place unlike most.  At 41, you get the service of a 5-star hotel, the d√©cor of a proper London dwelling, and the feeling of being at home.  Unlike most places, the only people allowed into the hotel are the guests.  While at other hotels the elevators and lounge spots may be taken by persons off the street, at 41 the entire experience is about the guests.  The GM, Mr. Hendry, can be found in the lounge talking with guests and staff, ensuring the hotel is doing everything to accommodate needs you may have.  Lauren at the desk is astute and just seems to get it, anticipating what you are looking for and providing the exact right information or assistance.  And their staff work as hard (and are as kind) as any I have seen in my travel.  The best example from 41‚Äôs‚Ä¶"
February 2016,Fantastic Stay,"We have just returned from a fabulous two night stay at Hotel 41 in London.  The hotel staff were friendly, polite, attentive and ready to assist whenever required.  We returned fro seeing 'Wicked' to find that the staff had arranged for the CD from the show to be playing in our room.  As we left, we were sent on our way with complimentary sweets and coffees for the journey - brilliant!!"
February 2016,Amazing stay,"It was amazing stay. We felt like a king :) Our room was spacious, very well equipment. Bed was very soft and comfortable. The location is also very good - a few steps to Victoria underground station and to the Buckingham Palace. The staff was wonderful especially Polish ladies: Magdalena, Patrycja and Paula. It is really worth to be there and it's for sure our No 1:) in London.   Pawe≈Ç & Joanna"
January 2016,Amazing stay - the staff are the stars,"This is such a special place, a unique little haven of calm in Central London. The minute we arrived, we were warmly welcomed and swiftly helped with all the chaos of our bags and small dog, to immediate calm. Even before arrival, with various phone conversations and emails, the service was excellent, and that just continued throughout our stay.   The hotel itself is quiet and relaxing, with the Lounge the central area for checking in (the front desk staff here are so helpful and lovely), and for eating, drinking and relaxing (or working, if you have to). Steve and the rest of the staff here just make you feel so welcome, are genuinely friendly without being intrusive, and are always on hand to tempt you with the various delicious complimentary delights that are laid on‚Ä¶"
September 2015,A Private Retreat in a Great Location,This hotel is excellently located next to Buckingham Palace and very close to Victoria Station.  It is the perfect retreat after a busy day in the city or to recover from a long flight.    The library and lounge area surrounds you with quiet and graceful English elegance - you'll feel like you're in the library at Downton Abbey for a cup of tea with the Duke and Duchess.  The rooms are also beautifully decorated and well insulated from the sounds of the city which helps to provide for a good night's sleep.   The staff and service is excellent and very attentive to your every need.  Advice: Finding this hotel can be a bit tricky since the outside is very understated.  I often have to tell the cabbie to go to the Ruben's Hotel which is next door to Hotel 41.
January 2016,Fabulous,"Worthy of the all rave reviews. We stayed for 2 nights and I could have cheerfully moved in!  Quiet, friendly but exemplary service, super breakfasts, great complimentary evening supper courtesy of the ""plunder the pantry"" facility. Definitely worth booking in advance for the best prices and worth asking the team to source theatre tickets etc.  We would stay again in a heartbeat."
January 2016,Perfect Anniversary,"This was a truly wonderful, relaxing stay. The staff were so attentive, nothing was too much trouble. We were thoroughly spoilt with champagne on arrival, a gorgeous cake for our anniversary, and a very quiet room. Considering this is central London, it was like an oasis, very relaxing indeed. We will definitely be returning to 41 !"
February 2016,Amazing Hotel worthy of 6 stars,"My husband and I travel extensively and stay in hotels all over the UK, usually  of a four or five  star rating.  How this Hotel has not got 6 stars I do not know!  You will not be disappointed if you choose this Hotel.  Once you stay here you will not wish to stay anywhere else in London again.   The welcome reception was really lovely with a drink and nibbles on arrival.  A beautiful executive lounge to sit in and relax.   All of the staff are exceptionally lovely and nothing is too much trouble.  They really do make you feel very special.   Our room 4101 was very comfortable with views over the Royal Mews.  The bed was huge and very comfortable, high quality sheets and pillows and luxury duvet.   The bathroom had large bath and shower with ample Penhaligon toiletries, luxury‚Ä¶"
February 2016,Simply fabulous ,"My recent stay at hotel 41 exceeded all expectations and I can see why the hotel is number one in London.  The two ladies that helped me at check in and check out were excellent and could not do enough for me.  The hotel is beautiful as is the room. The fire place in particular is a wonderful touch.  The drinks and snacks in the executive lounge were also great and the service impeccable. As was the food I ordered by room service, absolutely delicious.  All in all hotel 41 is an excellent place to stay and I would recommend the hotel to anybody who is going to London.  I hope to return soon. "
May 2015,Service beyond compare,"Our stay lasted a week, so we had the full experience and can confidently say their service is beyond compare. The main lounge is remarkable, being both elegant and comfortable; You can truly relax here. You sip cocktails by the fire and feel you are in the home of a good friend who just happens to make killer martinis. Having tea in the late afternoon? Be sure to leaf through any of a number of gorgeous coffee table books on Rock Gods or Fashion or Art & Architecture which you always mean to purchase, never do and turn out to be even more interesting than you imagined. This is where you will have breakfast and breakfast *is* the most important meal of the day. Every day my husband had something new and every day I had the same two egg omelette with toast and tea; Every day our‚Ä¶"
February 2016,Attentive Service,"Centrally located in a quintessential old-style London hotel. The service levels were incredibly high. In fact, I have never experienced this level of service in London. I highly recommend this hotel."
February 2016,Perfect birthday ,"I recently visited hotel 41 for my birthday and it was the most wonderful stay.  Everyone was so welcoming and friendly.   I was greeted with champagne and a plethora of snacks throughout the day.  The service is above and beyond what I expected. And as the reviews set out, definitely worth the #1 rating.   Thanks again to everyone at the hotel. It was truly exceptional. "
February 2016,Beyond expectations,"We went for a short break to celebrate my wife's special birthday and there could be no better place to be. The hotel is accessed via a smart entrance off Buckingham Palace Road and a lift takes you to the hotel which is located on the fifth floor. The heart of the hotel is the executive lounge where breakfast is served and there are a variety of snacks available throughout the day. Nothing is too much to ask for and the polite, smart and professional staff were the best in the business. There are two young lads who are working in the hotel as part of their professional studies and they will no doubt go on to top jobs in their chosen careers.   We travelled with our dog, Rocky, and he was treated like royalty.   The hotel itself is only small, but the staff/customer ratio is‚Ä¶"
February 2016,Phonomenal!,"We spent last night at Hote41 and it was quite possibly the most fabulous hotel stay we have ever had (and there have been a few!)   The staff could not do enough for us, and the surroundings are beautiful. Our room was stunning, and every need that you could have, was catered for. The members of staff addressed you by name and made you feel truly important.  I would go back in a heartbeat!"
February 2016,Believe the reviews,"Hotel 41 really is that good- the attention to detail is impeccable. We have had a hugely enjoyable overnight stay. Our mystery ""turn down"" lady came and went whilst we were at The Royal Albert Hall; we returned to a roaring fire, candles and rose petals which was a true pleasure to behold- she clearly took a lot of trouble to make it look wonderful and succeeded Book a night- it's worth it!"
January 2016,Best birthday & engagement celebration weekend!,"The staff and the service are what makes this hotel stand out above the rest, from the doorman opening our taxi door and carrying our bags inside, to the offer of bottled water for our journey home, and everything in between, our stay was nothing short of magical! The Conservatory suite has to be seen to be believed - a TV in the bathroom (along with jacuzzi bath and double length shower), a separate lounge area with a fire, TV and mini bar, and the most comfortable bed ever! Breakfast was superb - a choice of cooked or continental with such a vast choice of pastries, cereals, fruit, bread, meat, cheese.... Our suite included complimentary sewing kit, shoe shine kit, dental kit, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, bubble bath, tissues, cotton buds and cotton wool pads. Dressing‚Ä¶"
January 2016,Incredible pampering,"The entire hotel experience is guest-focused down to the last detail. From the moment you check-in, you're treated like the only customer they've ever had, and the staff is happy to meet your every need and whim. The rooms are very stylish and comfortable, the turn down service is delightful, and the nightly snack buffet was delicious. I especially enjoyed having an entire tea service brought up to my room and poured for me each morning - certainly eased the wake up process!"
October 2015,A real VIP experience,"The building and your surroundings are absolutely beautiful but the staff are fantastic and make such a difference. This must be what it is like to be treated like Royalty. What a fantastic experience. The service is 1st class and exemplary without being intrusive. The rooms are fabulous, the little touches make the stay extra special.  The reception team were so helpful. I can not find a single fault with 41. If you get the chance go and stay here!"
January 2016,Anniversary weekend,"Amazing, amazing, amazing....Everything you can ever want and more. Quite possibly the most attentive and helpful staff anywhere in the world. Amazing location, wonderfully appointed rooms. The free food and drink are of the highest quality,The paid for food and drink is worth every penny. I would be happy to live here for the rest of my life (finances depending) but otherwise I will just have to enjoy it when I can.  Please go and find out for yourselves how great this hotel is!"
December 2015,Best hotel I have ever stayed in for service,"The reviews on here are all excellent and justifiably so.  We stayed here the night after our wedding as we needed somewhere to stay before flying to New York the next day for our honeymoon. We treated ourselves to the Romance Package and didn't look back.  You truly are treated like a VIP from the minute you enter the door. The staff chat to you like they actually care and you can choose from an array of hot drinks or (limitless) champagne after you check-in.  The room, although on the smaller side, is immaculately decorated and very relaxing. It has all mod cons you would expect from a luxury hotel and not everything costs (i.e. proper tea and coffee on offer with biscuits, full Sky TV, really nice bathroom amenities). As we went for the romance package we were spoiled with‚Ä¶"
January 2016,Fabulous Hotel,"Our daughter booked us in for a night for my husbands birthday in January.  I can't praise it enough. The level of service from ALL the staff was exceptional, lots of smiley faces.  The room and the bed were extremely  comfortable, even rose petals and tea lights when we gotback to the room.  The tea was an added treat, homemade cakes and scones.  Would cetainly make sure to go back again."
December 2015,AMAZING,"My partner & I visited Hotel 41 over the Christmas period to celebrate her Christmas Day birthday and our 20th anniversary, which I mentioned while booking.  What an amazing hotel, we were enchanted. The level of service we received from Team 41 was incomparable.  We have visited many 5 star hotels in Europe and USA but we have rarely encountered such a level of friendly, professional attention as we received from the Team 41 staff.  We were warmly welcomed on arrival with a much appreciated free glass of champagne whilst checking in and when we were taken to our room our bags were already there.  This level of service continued throughout our stay and we were struck by the Team's genuine wish to provide us with a highly comfortable and enjoyable experience.  It was the little‚Ä¶"
November 2015,Great Service but rooms needs some renovations,"This is #1 in trip advisor list and deserved that rankings based on service, amenities, guest service is superb , location is great only comment is rooms needs to be renovated, Concierge helped me to book very good restaurants ."
January 2016,Best hotel we've ever stayed in! ,"We visited hotel 41 on the 16th Jan for my husbands 40th and from start to finish I cannot fault our stay. We stayed in the conservatory room which was a stunning room with downstairs lounge, big bedroom, wonderful jacuzzi bath and a stunning glass roof. The staff made us feel so welcome and made my husbands birthday so special, from the birthday cake in the room to the rose petals and candles in the room on our return (all totally unexpected). This 5 star hotel is welcoming and relaxing without any of the snobbery or up tight feel to other 5 star hotels. Staff are friendly, attentive and warm. We had ample complimentary champagne, delicious canap√©s and snacks from the buffet. In the evening we had booked a room at la caprice and we were handed a print out of walking directions‚Ä¶"
January 2016,Priceless,Feeling at home when you are not at home... We spent a weekend (first time with our baby) and everything was perfect. The staff was very helpful and we had a very good time. Since a few years Hotel 41 is the place we book when we visit London. It has become like a tradition... Thanks!
January 2016,Best London hotel we've stayed in!,"Hotel 41 is a small hotel on the fifth floor above the Rubens Hotel. Enter by a private entrance and take the lift to the fifth floor reception Executive Room, everything seems so calm and smooth - a million miles from the madness of the big hotel receptions.  No queue, only a flute of Veuve and a smooth registration in a split level library, more reminiscent of a twenties explorers club. Staff universally excellent, friendly without being over formal or familiar. The rooms have a striking contrast of black and white, but it works. Spotlessly clean and well equipped with multiple Loewe TV's and a full Sky channel set viewed in sharp HD - not the typical chain hotel 'mush'. Large beds, crisp white 41 branded bedding, mattress toppers and unobtrusive AC give the best possible‚Ä¶"
January 2016,"Perfectly Exceptional, Balanced Just Right","We found ourselves in a last minuted situation needing to find a hotel while visiting London. Of course checking TA first the obvious choice was Hotel 41. From the moment of booking through departure there was not a weak link in the experience. Having been fortunate enough to stay in many nice hotels in my lifetime, this easily ranks amongst THE best experiences thanks primary to the staff and people that take such pride in this small boutique 5 star hotel. The room, what everyone expects from any hotel, comfortable, warm, well equipped, safe and quiet. The staff, friendly, accommodating, genuine and caring without exception, You feel they really enjoy what they do and are glad you are there.  There is a very comfortable common area that you are taken to when you are checked in‚Ä¶"
January 2016,Perfect from start to finish!!,"I recently celebrated my birthday with a trip to London staying in Hotel 41. On arrival we were warmly greeted by a member of staff, were relieved of our luggage and accompanied to check-in and a welcoming glass of champagne! I know all of this is promised on the hotel's website but the reality is more than expected. I can honestly say this was the warmest welcome I've ever experienced - and I've stayed in many luxury hotels around the world. The difference I think is that the staff appear genuinely happy in their work and that carries through in everything they do. The hotel ticks all the boxes for luxury and service and there is little I can add to hat has already been said in previous reviews. In fact we were so comfortable and cosy on our last evening that we stayed in for‚Ä¶"
January 2016,Outstanding service from an exceptional Hotel,Weekend away at Hotel 41 to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday. Booked based on the really great feedback on trip advisor and wasn't dissapointed. Exceptional sevice from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. Have stayed in numerous supposedly 5 star hotel in the past which have never lived up to their ratting. Hotel 41 not only lives up to its rating but goes beyond it in terms of the friendlyness and proffessionalism of its staff. Best hotel experiance we have ever had!!!!!!!
January 2016,30th birthday visit,"This hotel is exceptional from start to finish. The surroundings are stunning, the staff are fantastic and they go to the next level of detail to make your stay special. The location is also very central.  Hotel 41 made my 30th birthday a very memorable one. If you are thinking of booking don't hesitate, you won't beat this hotel."
December 2015,Outstanding establishment ,"Stayed for Christmas and anniversary trip. Staff at 41 are better than anywhere else I have stayed, so attentive and everything with our stay was personalised to us! So thoughtful. Great location for London hotel. Fantastic stay and will definitely be back when we can! "
February 2015,London Style and Luxury,"The rooms in this lovely hotel are on the top floor and some have working fireplaces. I cannot say enough about the gracious staff. Every single person was fabulous and wanted to make sure all was perfect.  I particularly love the champagne offered upon arrival. My room was comfortable and spotless with a view of the Royal Mews. I appreciated the tasteful decor throughout 41.  I enjoyed  breakfast in the hotel, ""Plunder the Pantry""which gave me access to snacks throughout the day, hors d'oeuvres in the lounge in the evening, free ice cream and the perfectly stocked honesty bar.   No request is too difficult. I asked for arrangements for a car to take me to the Royal Opera House and the staff was happy to do that or to call a taxi for me. I was given easy walking directions for‚Ä¶"
December 2015,This is a REAL Gem,"WOW, this hotel is AMAZING, our second visit to 41, equally as impressive as our first visit. Attention to detail is first class, great rooms, very comfortable and the fire is a real treat when you go to your room after a long day in London. The executive lounge, with its roaring fire and great food and drink selection is a must.  Very hard to fault this GREAT hotel & the staff are all FANTASTIC.  Can't wait for the next visit."
May 2015,Just when you think it can't get any better... it does!,"This is my sixth stay at 41. Again, I am lost for words as to the level of service provided by this property, the level of support, the degree to which the staff are willing to go.  It is incredible and it is better than a home from home. It is an entire team devoted to ensuring you are comfortable and that all your needs are met- no matter what they are. It does not matter if you need an extremely rare object, they will look, or if you need someone to set up a perfect platter. Whatever it is, the staff will take wonderful care of you.  For everyone considering Hotel 41 for their stay in London, I beseech you not to look elsewhere. Do yourself a favor and stay here- I have stayed in many of the world's finest hotels, including most of London's, and there is nowhere that can even‚Ä¶"
December 2015,No way can this be the best hotel in London........,Yes its a nice hotel. The staff are excellent and the rooms are comfortable. But it doesn't compare with the luxury and facilities of the likes of The Dorchester etc. It operates a mega expensive even for London honesty bar system. So don't get caught out at checkout. The rooms are well equipped with various toiletries only what you would expect at the room rate. Summing up. Its nothing special. If you travel a lot and have experienced some of the worlds leading hotels this is like a glorified B & B with good staff.
December 2015,Comfortable and friendly,"We had a faultless and very enjoyable one-night stay here. We booked a standard room but were upgraded on arrival to what was described as the best room in the house (4104) - it was on two floors, with a cost sitting area complete with flame gas fire downstairs and bedroom and large bathroom upstairs. The crowning glory was a large glass atrium over the bed, with a panoramic view of the heavens above! My wife arrived very early, well before check-in time (I had a meeting in town), and was offered every courtesy and full use of the comfortable lounge until the room was available. Throughout our stay the staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful. We were on a breakfast-inclusive rate and the breakfast was superb. We had an evening meal at the adjoining B-Bar (part of‚Ä¶"
December 2015,Amazing customer service,"Have visited 5 star hotels all over the world and this without doubt was my beat customer service experience. Stayed for 2 nights over the weekend, on arrival all members of staff were very welcoming and we enjoyed some champaign. Not all my stay was perfect in the aspect the floors are very noisy when trying to sleep, so had a sleepless couple of nights. What i will say though is I still give this a five star simply for presentation and service from all employees, so for them to get me to look past this was fantastic. Each and every member of staff took a genuine interest in your days and plans and I would definitely be visiting the hotel again."
December 2015,50th Birthday Treat,"We visited 41 for two nights from the the 2nd to 4th December.  It was to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday and we had two rooms. One they set up as a twin for my two grown up daughters (4109) and a king size for ourselves (4105).  Both rooms were fabulous and have just about everything you could ever need. The staff are absolutely first class and cater for your every need. I cannot fault the service we had from the moment we checked in to the moment we left so thank you to Andrew and the team......  It's probably the most I've ever paid for a room at a hotel but have to say it was good value compared to other top end London hotels and if in London again this is where we will stay.  If you want a peaceful, quiet hotel with top service look no further. "
December 2015,Wow! Absolute amazing and fantastically high levels of service!,"Recently stayed here for two nights, we arrived on Saturday around 8pm, taken up to the hotel level (floor 5). We had champaign of our choice while we checked in. We got shown to our room... Absolutely fantastic! A very nice fresh fruit bowl with a bottle of bubbly and a very nicely presented evening turn down. Breakfast both mornings was absolutely fantastic! The best poached eggs I've ever had! Again with a glass of bubbly. The plunder the pantry is fantastic.. Snacks all day.  We even had a few snacks prepared for us to keep us going on our shopping trip. We checked out at 12 but our train wasn't until 8pm... We was invited back after our day out for a drink and snacks before we leave. I've never been to such a well run hotel. Never have I received such high levels of‚Ä¶"
December 2015,Outstanding,"Well where do I start from the moment we walked into the hotel it was absolutely amazing the staff Were very professional and caring, especially Andrew.  The room was beautiful and the little touches in the room with his and her slippers,sweets,fruit and the little elemis gifts each night was just wonderful.  We enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere in the executive lounge you have the right balance for breakfast and then to enjoy a nice glass of champagne and cocktails during the evening.  By far the most amazing weekend we have ever had.  We can't wait to return to stay with you on New Year's Eve for 4 nights.  I have not stopped talking about the hotel and recommended it to everyone"
December 2015,Absolutely fabulous ,"Hotel 41 is an absolutely fabulous place to stay. You are made to feel so welcome as soon as you enter the hotel. I came to stay with my brother and two friends on 31 Dec to 2 January and had an absolutely amazing New Years celebration. All the staff are so lovely, so helpful and absolutely nothing is too much trouble. You feel thoroughly spoilt from the minute you arrive at the hotel. The executive lounge is a lovely place to chill out and enjoy the plunder pantry, which changes throughout the day with all sorts of lovely goodies. I have stayed in several 5 star hotels over the years but I have to say that Hotel 41 tops them all. The attention to detail is simply exceptional, you have to stay at Hotel 41 to really understand what I mean. They really have thought of everything.‚Ä¶"
December 2015,Fabulous from the moment you walk through the door,"I rarely make reviews on tripadvisor, but i thought it was important that i express what an obsolute gem this is, from walking in the door to leaving, nothing is too much trouble. The staff are fantastic and make an effort to introduce themselves, get to know you and they really remember your name, which really does provide the personnal touch that is so often missing in the bigger hotels. The ongoing flow of nibbles/food in the lounge is excellent and literally you can stay there all night and just soke in the relaxed, classy ambiance. As for the room, top notch, again every detail covered. Definitely a 5 star experiance."
December 2015,Our stay was excellent this year!,"We recently returned from a 7 night stay, our third stay at the Hotel 41.  We enjoyed an excellent experience this time and continue to smile over our great memories!  We had requested our favorite room overlooking the Royal Mews and were happy to be staying in that room once again. The room is nice sized and the bathroom with that huge, deep tub is wonderful.   My daughter needs a gluten-free diet and this time the 41 met her needs very well. She was extremely happy with the options available to her this stay and that alone made us both want to return yet again.   We both enjoyed the excellent breakfast offerings each morning. Those Belgian waffles - fantastic!  The dinner and afternoon tea which are included with our Costco vacation package were very enjoyable. Plunder the‚Ä¶"
December 2015,PERFECT in every way!,"After reading tripadvisor reviews, I booked the hotel as a surprise for my boyfriend to celebrate being together for 10 years. From the moment we walked in, we were made to feel that nothing was too much bother and as if we were their only guests. We were greeted with a choice of champagne (to check in with!) before being shown to our stunning room (Monarch Suite) and then spent the evening relaxing in the Lounge. The staff are not only attentive but very friendly in a professional manner. We had a truly magical evening and breakfast was excellent too. Every part of the hotel is pristine and the food is excellent but the people who really make the difference are the staff. For a special treat, book Hotel 41 as you won't be disappointed."
December 2015,"Hotel 41 The best unknown hotel in London, that does the exceptional like no other","For our 2nd trip this year to Hotel 41, Malcon Hendry  and his exceptional team decided to raise the bar on what can only be called sublime,   From the check in ( try it m out of this word )  , to an unexpected upgrade to the conversatoey suite, ( amazing experience )!. 41 ensured the experience was nothing but WOW ,,,,   I asked staff for tickets to Aled Jones at Chrisrmas , at the Albert Hall for a very special treat for my beautiful wife ,,what we actually got, front row seats at the side of the stage , next to Aled , imagine Christmas with Aled ' waking in the air ' Jones , with the greatest eveingi of Xmas you could ask for   41 sorted a reservation of the sky Gardnen, you will never do the shard again   The staff are equesitte , this is service you would always want in‚Ä¶"
December 2015,Perfect Weekend,"From the moment we walked in we felt more royal than the lady who lives across the road! We can only echo other reviews in that the staff are absolutely amazing, nothing is too much trouble. They are very attentive without being at all intrusive and all seem genuinely interested in you. The executive lounge is a haven of peace and tranquillity and the rooms have every comfort you could wish for. The real stand out feature is the attention to detail. This truly is an exceptional hotel."
December 2015,Great escape,Lovely hotel where when you are in the restaurant/lobby or in your room completely forget that the hotel is in the center of busy London. Beautiful interior including beautiful rooms. Very nice and helpful staff. Good breakfast and the complementary snacks and bites (until 1am) are a good reason for drinks in the hotel bar.  Would go again 100%  
December 2015,Brilliant,"Took my husband for his 50th birthday, the service was impeccable, the staff were amazing, we were made to feel very welcome & special. The whole experience was phenomenal & I would highly recommend to others."
December 2015,The Best Staff in London,"I stayed at 41 for the third time this year-- so clearly I am a fan.  Here are some of my thoughts. This hotel can compete on every front that most people judge a hotel. The rooms are very nicely appointed--classic English style, very tastefully done. The beds are very comfortable (you might need that wakeup call so as to not oversleep...I do) The rooms in which I have stayed have had the shower separate from the bath, a fireplace, an excellent television with full Sky premium programming amongst other amenities. That is the baseline. However, what makes this hotel shine so bright is its staff-- I cannot say that I have seen better in London.   Firstly, the staff members are always beautifully attired and present themselves in a first class manner. They always seem to be aware‚Ä¶"
December 2015,1st class in all departments,Went to London for Christmas shopping and a show with my wife Hotel 41 was the icing on the cake Treated like royalty from the time we went through the door until we left Staff couldn't do enough for us Will certainly be staying at 41 when we go back to London 
November 2015,How is this #1??,"At time of booking this hotel was number 1 on TA. Foolishly I thought we were in for the treat of a lifetime. Sadly, while this place is very pleasant, in a superb location and very lovely there are many London hotels which would knock it hands down. Staff looked after us very well if in s slightly cloying way. Main problems were the very noisy plumbing and a mysterious red light which prevented housekeeping from servicing the room. (To be fair though they had dropped in a note to ask us to call for service but we returned too late). All in all a good, albeit a little dated, hotel in a very prestigious neighbourhood!"
October 2015,Big birthday stay,"We stayed here overnight on Sunday 25/10/15 and everything I had read was totally true!! I booked it as a surprise for my husband's birthday (along with dinner at Heston's a short walk away - also fantastic!) after reading the fab reviews about its quirky atmosphere, amazing staff and great location. I was not disappointed with any aspect. The booking process was easy, check in was luxurious and a lovely change from the impersonal check ins at other hotels. We enjoyed a lovely glass of champagne then, as the room wasn't ready, which I had been told I advance and was not a problem, e left our overnight bag to enjoy the rest if the day in London.  On returning to the hotel the staff were again wonderfully smiley and attentive, we went to our room - complete with gorgeous treats‚Ä¶"
October 2015,50th Birthday Trip,"My wife had done extensive research on where to stay for my 50th birthday visit and I am pleased to say that she could not have picked a better hotel in the whole of London to spend our 3 days celebrating my 50th birthday earlier this week.  Where to start? Firstly the welcome is unbelievable. You are whisked from a very discrete lobby, via the lift up to the fifth floor where all the rooms are, to the exceutive lounge to check in. You are handed a glass of champagne immediately to help you relax and start to enjoy the stay. The staff made you feel so welcome and at ease - I will return to the staff later, although to call them that does all of them an injustice as they felt like friends!  Our room was stunning and so tasteful. There would be nothing I would change. The food was‚Ä¶"
October 2015,Perfect,"My partner and I stayed here for one night to celebrate our 5th anniversary. It was simply wonderful.   When we arrived we were greeted with champagne and then shown around before being taken to our beautiful room. There was a yummy chocolate cake waiting for us which said 'happy anniversary' aswell as a plate of little treats.   The room was comfy and so nicely decorated. It was a bit warm for us in the room even with the air conditioning on, but we are from the north so it was like our summer in London!   We shared a bottle of wine in the executive lounge and were presented with canap√©s which were really tasty. After going out for a few cocktails, we went to 'plunder the pantry' which was perfect! We went away with 3 platefuls of food and felt a bit greedy, but the friendly‚Ä¶"
October 2015,An amazing night away!,"I stayed here with my girlfriend for one night last Thursday and we were both bowled over by the Hotel. On arrival we  were escorted to the fifth floor where the reception is and Florent was very helpful and charming providing us with a glass of champagne after our travels. Check in was quick and we got a tour of the Executive Lounge which was very impressive and definitely felt 'exclusive'. The Hotel itself is small but beautifully appointed with gorgeous rooms and you rarely run in to other guests giving you more of an 'isolated' feeling, perfect for us. I proposed to my girlfriend that evening and she said yes and it certainly helped that the hotel turndown service was so impressive with champagne and candles, chocolates, music etc. The honesty bar is very nice too, food is‚Ä¶"
October 2015,A jolly olde week,"We returned 2 weeks ago from a lovely 7 night  stay at the 41 Hotel. The 41 was even better than we had expected  even after all  the glowing reviews we'd read about it. The location was perfect between Buckingham  Palace and Victoria Station.We were minutes from the Underground, but could also walk to many of the major attractions. Our duplex suite was roomy and finely furnished. All the food :  ""raid the pantry"", breakfasts, afternoon snacks including daily treats in the lobby ,wine and cocktails served in the lounge were delicious and signature touches that set this hotel apart., but the real strength of this hotel is their staff. There was no one who didn't seem to enjoy their position or who wasn't knowledgeable, personable and professional. They all worked to make our stay‚Ä¶"
October 2015,A wonderful experience and service that is second to none,"We stayed at this hotel for one night recently to celebrate a big birthday. Like a lot of people, we have been fortunate enough to stay in luxury hotels around the world and I can honestly say that the service here rivals anything experienced elsewhere. It feels a bit of a clich√© to repeat the accolades given by other reviewers, but they are completely merited.   The surroundings are beautiful and very relaxing. The staff are attentive, without being fawning or over-the-top, and seem genuinely to be enjoying themselves. Staff who come in for a special mention are Andrew, Steve and Dickson (A true gentleman. ""Tea in the morning, champagne in the evening"" was his motto for our stay, a man after my own heart!), although everyone we met went the extra mile, including one man who‚Ä¶"
October 2015,Terrific!,"We loved this hotel. Quirky, charming and so comfortable.  The entire staff was so professional, upbeat and couldn't do enough for us.  We were also with two other couples and they even gave us our own private room for breakfast each morning. So many little touches and extras were included..  breakfast, tea and mini sandwiches, amazing hot chocolate waiting at the door, candies & ice cream at night, mood sprays at turndown.  It's rare to find this kind of hospitality. Stay here!"
October 2015,Perfection ,"I was in town for 24 hours and this property is perfection.  It starts with a champagne greeting at check-in, yummy snacks, truffles in the room and lush linens and pillows for a restful evening.  Really a lovely experience and I think we'll stay longer next time."
September 2015,Best place to stay ,"Came here for my birthday, me and my friends stayed for 2 nights and it was perfect! The staff where so helpful and lovely! Also the food was amazing! We had no problems here and we will definitely come back when we are next in London, the room sizes where nicely sized too. "
November 2015,As Advertised,"They have an extension on the room phone labeled ""Whatever Whenever"". This in essence describes the level of service at Hotel 41 London. The entire staff was truly exceptional. If you want to be treated the way everyone should always treat each other, then this is the hotel for you."
November 2015,Brilliant Service exceeded expectations.,"The Hotel 41 is a decadent property minutes away from Buckingham Palace, Harrods, pubs and restaurants.The accommodations and surroundings are as expected for a hotel at this address, but the staff and management are superb. The service was outstanding,attention to detail;impressive and the custom made treats and snacks; delicious. Steve Jones, in particular, was brilliant. We followed his schedule to ensure the stay of all 8 of us was perfect. He suggested shops, places to eat, shared in the laughs but truly never lost sight of the service level expected. We will return because he was the difference. The Hotel 41 exceeded expectations."
November 2015,Brilliant,"Couldn't have been better, would recommend to anyone who wants to have a great time.  Staff was really friendly, food great, cocktails are great and I love the fact the you have access to the executive lounge. Overall would defiantly come back again"
November 2015,truly superb,"Given all the excellent reviews, expectations were high and yes, 41 and the team delivered. Even before we arrived we got help in making some difficult to get dinner reservations, once we were there we were taken care off so well we did not want to leave. Location great, lounge so welcoming and comfy, coming home to the logfire and rose petals in the room was almost too much :-) and we loved plunder the pantry for an inbetween snack. Overall truly superb!"
November 2015,"Wonderful, wouldn't stay anywhere else in London","Second time back at Hotel 41 and won't be our last. The rooms are beautiful but it's the staff who make this hotel so unique with their warmth and charm. They really can't do enough for their guests, highlighted perfectly by the "" whatever, whenever"" button in the rooms! Amazing!"
December 2014,The most amazing hotel in the UK,"One of the best hotels you will ever stay in central London  Not only the best in London but probably the best you will ever stay in FACT  Staff were awesome, food next level... And I cannot stress just how fabulous this hotel is...  From an exquisite interior and lounge area to Buffett food options...  Hotels suites are about average for London at ¬£500 a night but room service at 2am for a chap that wanted a burger and chips after a night out on the town...  Could not be more accommodating and a rare find in central londom"
November 2015,Lived up to expectations,We spent 4 nights at Hotel 41 to celebrate my 50th birthday. Firstly the location is perfect - a few minutes to walk to Buckingham Palace (we wandered along and saw the changing of the guard by accident!) and a 20 minute walk to Piccadilly Circus.  The staff was fantastic - friendly and helpful.  The room although not big was so comfortable and the best equipped room I have ever stayed in - if you needed it the chances are it was there!  The executive lounge was where everything happened!  The breakfasts were lovely although we stuck with the continental 2 of the 4 days as there was a great choice and we took full advantage of the 'plunder the pantry' one evening - we had eaten in a Michelin star restaurant the evening before and my other half actually thought the hotel food was‚Ä¶
November 2015,Perfect for families!!,"First, i should say that i traveled with my wife and our one year old toddler (sofia).  We have been to all kind of luxury hotels (al maha, conrad maldives, etc) and this is one is one of those. You can say, that it's different, i agree, but still a luxury resort.  Even though you do not have amenities such as pool, spa, etc, their first amenity is their hospitality, second their attention to details and third their service.   It was our anniversary, and they not only provided a cake but they also decorated our room with candles and rose petals.  Service. Whenever we wanted a reservation we contacted front desk and they did all reservations for us. That's a big plus. Whatever we needed for our baby they provided in matter of seconds.   Room: its a big size room, with an‚Ä¶"
October 2015,Wonderful and unforgettable stay at Hotel 41,"This was our second time at the 41, as we decided to celebrate my 40th birthday there. The staff is really excellent, attentive. They reached out to us days before our arrival to ensure everything is prepared for our arrival. I think its those little details that make a hotel stand out from the rest - they truly make you feel home. The room was beautifully decorated, rose petals, pralines, candles - it was a truly memorable birthday. We stayed for three nights this time, the only regret I have is that we were not able to stay longer, it was hard to leave. I definitely want to come back to the 41 on my 41st birthday."
July 2015,Superb hotel with excellent service,We stayed at Hotel 41 during our honeymoon. We loved our room and the friendly staff. Excellent location and a wonderful experience overall. Complimentary snacks and coffee were nice perks. Very glad that we extended our stay at the hotel.
October 2015,Absolutely phenomenal.  We had a few minor issues which were promptly addressed.,"Location: Fairly central from as little as I know of London and only a 5 minute walk to the Victoria underground and train stations.  The choice of restaurants seemed to be OK.  Accommodations: The building is certainly old but the rooms are very spacious (stayed in an Executive King).  The beds were very comfortable.  The bathroom was a decent size as well.  We had a few problems with our TV not working in the bathroom, however, no big deal.  They were able to fix it  after a couple of days.  Our sink and bathtub were slow to drain.  They were able to fix the sink and offered to swap rooms due to the tub drain, however, we only had one more evening and didn't want to bother.  Other than that the room was great!  Food and drinks: The executive club was great and the food was‚Ä¶"
October 2015,A VERY SPECIAL PLACE TO STAY IN LONDON!,"This is our third stay at Hotel 41 and it has never disappointed us.  We stayed six nights in the end.We love staying here. It is a very special place to stay, the ambience, the friendliness of the staff and the high quality of all amenities provided.Hotel 41 is so close to everything you want to do in London - exceptional accommodation.  The breakfasts are simply amazing, the snacks sensational and most of all the caring attitude of the staff at Hotel 41 make this a great place to come back to after a busy day in London.  I was put in hospital for three days and the staff were amazing & caring to my husband & daughter - we can't thank you enough.  It was so good to come out. This is our third stay at Hotel 41 and it has never disappointed us.  We love staying here. It is a very‚Ä¶"
September 2015,Geat Location and atmosphere!!,"Geat Location and atmosphere!!  Great service all over the Hotel !!! Thanks to the concierge for all the support. Services and facilities are perfect, Decor superb.  Attentive staff and corteaus   Recommended 100% "
October 2015,A perfect place!,"Five nights at Hotel 41 were not enough!  Everything about this little jewel was perfection.  The staff was amazing, the setting was perfect and the rooms were fabulous.  The location was directly across from the Mews at Buckingham Palace...great to watch a parade!  We will be returning for our next trip, with out a doubt."
October 2015,The finest service I have ever experienced,"I have stayed at Mandarin's, Peninsula's, Four Season's, Ritz, etc. and the attitude and service of the team at Hotel 41 made those other wonderful hotels seem like a Holiday Inn.  The common room, where food and drinks were available all day long made it feel like you were staying in somebody's home.  There were three couples vacationing together and this room and the service offered there made it an incredible experience."
October 2015,AMAZING 5 STAR & LOCATION,WOW the location does not get better then directly across from the Palace and the staff are all beyond 5 star if that is possible yes its small and reserved and cozy and quaint and that is what we are paying for its pricy but goes the xtra mile in all areas try the champagne its served 24/7 great fireplace room for breakfast and thru out the day and evenings are relaxed and very British warm by the fireplace and great staff to cater to your every whim & more: for me being on a solo adventure to London i felt very catered and nurtured by all: thanks Antonio CEO/ PRES /
October 2015,"So very, very perfect....","We stayed in Hotel 41 last weekend for 2 nights, and all I can say is, perfection. From the minute we stepped through the door to the time we left, we loved every minute. The attention to detail and the impeccable staff made this hotel such a special place. It was so much more than we expected and we will defiantly be back! Steve Jones needs a special mention, such a character and a real credit to the hotel. I could go on and on.....but do not hesitate to book this hotel, it's a real find."
October 2015,My Dad loves this place,We as a family love to come here and we love this place is always the best place to stay in London. The services are great it's pure luxury... My dad loves the location so not many Saudis stay which is a plus point to my dad lol. Every is great room service is so fast no messing around............
October 2015,Best service I've ever experienced,"Would like to thank all the staff at Hotel 41, for making our visit the most memorable hotel we've stayed in. The customer service is second to none! Absolutely flawless.  The conservatory room was mind-blowing. A roof that opens above the bed, truly one of a kind! I gave no instructions, except mentioning that we were celebrating our anniversary - so what the staff created was unbelievable.  Champagne, a fruit basket and a signed cake on arrival. We left, unannounced, to see a show, and upon returning to our room we discovered that it had been covered in rose-petals, had candles lit, and classical music playing. It was incredibly romantic and the thought and care that goes into the running of this place is just amazing. Breakfast was also delicious and well prepared.  I am a‚Ä¶"
October 2015,Truly amazing,"We were lucky enough to be treated to an evening stay at the amazing 41 , The Staff are exceptional in every way and the hotel has truly got to be the best we have ever stayed at,   The food on offer through out the evening and breakfast were of the highest quality as was the whole experience ,  If you get a chance spoil your self or some one special you would not be disappointed"
May 2015,ABSOLUTELY OUSTANDING!!!!,"Oh my where do I start!  We spent our wedding night here and got upgraded to the most amazing Conservatory suite....it took our breath away!!  From the moment we checked in we were treated like royalty, such friendly staff who chatted and asked us about our day, champagne on arrival, chocolates and fruits in the room, rose petals on the bed and and jacuzzi bath run for us at night with floating candles  This has to be one of the BEST hotels I have ever stayed and I will certainly be returning, as for recommending I am not sure I can do that as I want this little kept secret all to myself :-)  Keep up the amazing work Hotel 41 you are truly the best"
September 2015,Royal treatment,"Beginning at the less-than-grand entrance, then stepping inside into the small but beautiful downstairs lobby, you have no idea of what awaits you upstairs. It only gets better and better, believe me. Our room (Executive King) was spacious by European standards, well appointed with ample closet space, lovely bed linens, quality vanity items, and spotless bathroom with shower and separate large bath tub.  The lounge and dining area was very pretty with plenty of tables for meals and comfy seating arrangements for conversation and cocktails. It was a pleasant spot with first-class service.  The concierge was helpful in arranging tickets to various attractions and plays, along with directions to walkable sites. Overall we were thrilled with our good fortune to have picked Hotel 41‚Ä¶"
September 2015,The best ever!,"We can't say enough about the Hotel 41.  Between the fabulous rooms, the best shower, ""plunder the pantry"" and the best staff ever, I don't know how to keep my praise to a few sentences.  Just let me say, if you stay here, you won't be disappointed."
September 2015,A Different Twist,"Perfectly located (along side of Buckingham Palace) this hotel offers superb service and a lot of it.  We had been traveling for two months and had stayed in many 5 star hotels during this trip, but ""41"" is a step above.  Love the fact that there are only 22 rooms & 6 suites and love, love, love ""raid the pantry"".  Having met friends for late lunches two days and the theater another evening, all we needed was a little bite in the evening and ""the pantry"" was there for us.  It was a perfect way to end a 2 month trip.  However, now I'm spoiled; I can't imagine staying anywhere else when visiting London."
November 2014,Perfection!,Best hotel we have ever stayed at by far. The hotel is pricey but the service is excellent! We have already booked our trip again for this year. Stayed at many 5 star hotels before and the uniqueness of the boutique along with the welcoming service does not compare! 
September 2015,Best hotel ever!,"We stayed one night at hotel 41. It was the last night of a 'once in a lifetime' holiday to celebrate being with my wife for 30 years and our upcoming 50th birthdays. We had taken the Orient Express to Venice which was opulent beyond our wildest dreams. We then relaxed in Venice for 2 days, afterwhich we returned to London to finish off with what we hoped would be a lovely stay at the hotel 41...but it wasn't lovely....it was fantastic... The best hotel I have ever stayed at....from the doorman to the manager to the waiters and waitresses.... They made us feel special. If I could repeat this trip again, I would start with a night at the hotel 41, go on the Orient Express then come straight back to stay at the hotel 41 again. Thank you for putting the icing on the cake that was‚Ä¶"
September 2015,Overwhelming,"We recently stayed at Hotel 41 or our 10th anniversary. We would like to thank the entire team for making our stay such an amazing and unforgettable event. Everything was taken care of for us extremely well. All the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We would like to especially thank Mrs Monika Skrzynska for her care and detail, she made sure everything was set for our celebration throughout the entire time of our stay.  We stayed at the conservatory suite and our room was prepared in such manner, that we couldn't have asked for anything more.Comparing this to other luxury hotels we have stayed at we were extremely impressed. We will always remember our celebration at Hotel 41 and return in the future."
September 2015,Always exceeds expectations,This is the only place we stay in London.  They have truly exceptional service and the rooms are all wonderful and unique.  They never fail to surpass our expectations on each visit.  We look forward to visiting again each time we return.
September 2015,Truly a 5 star hotel,"Hotel 41, located right across the street from the Buckingham Palace complex was the nicest hotel we have ever stayed in.  It is a small hotel with a nice ground floor entrance with all the rooms are all on the 5th floor of a beautifully remodeled older building.  A real King sized bed, fireplace in the room, separate shower and tub.  Everything was first class.  We booked through Costco travel which included an extensive continental breakfast each morning and a free dinner at the partner restaurant next door.  The dinner even included all drinks.  The dining room looks is a beautiful mahogany wood room that looks more like a library in a multi million dollar home than the restaurant.  It is open all day and night with free snacks, meats, cheeses, etc.    One of the most‚Ä¶"
August 2015,Amazing Wedding Night!,We spent our wedding night at the Fabulous Hotel 41 and really can't praise them enough. The service really is second to none. From the first greeting to when we left everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful. Without asking they moved us into the conservatory suite which is a stunning room with rose petals everywhere!  Thank you so much for making the night so special... I couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough. In every way they go the extra mile to ensure you have a great stay.
August 2015,Very special hotel.,"My wife and I have just returned from a one night stay at Hotel 41.   Our short stay was an amazing treat and was better than we imagined, even after reading the reviews here. This was principally down the very high standard of service and the attentive friendly staff. I could write about the many little touches that made our stay special, but like many of the reviewers, I will leave it for you to have your own experience.  We are already planning our next stay."
August 2015,Wonderfull...,"We booked this hotel after reading several good reviews, but for us is was even better then we had expected. From the moment we entered we were treated as royals.  The room, and bathroom was great and very clean. Hotel is located near Buckingham Palace, and you can do everything by feet. But what us pleased the best was the kindness off the staff. Nothing is too much... Special thanks to Flo(rant), Dickson and Mitchell... Thanks for all you did... We will come back very soon..."
August 2015,fabulous experience,"I loved this hotel! Every time I turned around, I was being offered a glass of champagne. Luxurious linens, great food, beautiful decor, and all in the best area of London (across the street from Buckingham Palace!)  Best customer service - I thought they had mistaken me for a celebrity! Small and intimate. Everyone knows your name. I'm going back!  Keep in mind this is Europe and the rooms are not your standard cookie cutter layouts. We had an executive king which was a bed area and adjoining siting area. The bathroom had both a tub and shower, but the layout was one long room due to the existing architecture. It seemed odd at first, but we got used to it pretty fast."
June 2015,Simply the best,"We came to Hotel 41 for a bit of luxury for my wife's birthday earlier this year, and we were not disappointed. After we'd navigated our way in (via the hotel next door by mistake, who amusingly said they'd ""upgraded us to their 5-star hotel""!), the experience was exactly as promised - and more.  Service, champagne at check-in, the pantry to plunder - all perfect. The room was outstanding and very comfortable (and a free upgrade, a very nice extra birthday present!); best of all, having opted in advance to buy some birthday chocolates, the message I'd put down turned out to be delivered in cake form! A wonderful surprise.  Having eaten out during the day, the excellent food at the pantry was just right for a light supper. Breakfast was superb as well.  All in all, a perfect stay‚Ä¶"
August 2015,Amazing,"I booked the conservatory suite to celebrate our first wedding anniversary as surprise for my husband.  He was blown away.  From the moment we stepped through the doors to leaving, the whole experience was awesome.  All the staff provided us with exemplary service.  Whilst checking in, we were given a choice of champagne to choose from.  They serve a most wonderful brut rose champagne which we thought was smoother than some Cristal we have had.  We were shown to our room which was amazing with a small lounge area and steps leading upstairs to the bedroom with the glass ceiling.  The hotel had kindly provided an anniversary cake and some delicious petit fours.  We enjoyed afternoon tea in the cosy lounge area and again with the delicious champagne.  We went out for dinner and‚Ä¶"
August 2015,First class,"Hi! When we arrived at Hotel 41 we were pleasantly greeted by the lady on the front desk. We were then shown up stairs to the Executive Lounge, which when you walk inside is simply stunning. The hotel staff had everything already organised for us including complimentary champagne yum yum! We were shown to our room (which had been upgraded) and wow! It was breathtaking. The attention to detail was second to none. And the added surprise was the jacuzzi in the bathroom!!! After a few drinks in the city we retired back to the Executive Lounge where we nibbled on a delicious selection of foods and more champagne. The staff attended to our every need and couldn't have made us happier. Our whole experience was brilliant from the moment we stepped foot inside to the moment we left. If‚Ä¶"
August 2015,Perfect again,"Every staff member we encountered at 41 was friendly, helpful, and professional. The service was impeccable! Each morning we would call the front desk for our daily Latte, which would arrive within 3 minutes. One of our favorite activities was sitting in the Lounge for afternoon tea or a perfect drink.  We will return to London again simply for the pleasure of staying at 41."
August 2015,Beyond expectation,"I had read the reviews. I had looked at the website. I had no idea just how good the experience would actually be once I visited. My wife and I had a long weekend in London at the start of our holiday and made Hotel 41 our base.   The Executive lounge is a brilliant concept and works so well as the 'hub' of this hotel. On arrival, as many have noted, we were offered champagne and we sat and relaxed for so long that we felt completely 'at home' in the lounge. In face it was over 2 hours after check in that we actually managed to find the room we had booked!  At breakfast Stefan made us feel very welcome and within a short space of time he felt like a member of the family rather than a member of staff. This is the secret to this hotel: detail. In our package we had a 'romantic‚Ä¶"
April 2015,MOST AMAZING HOTEL EVER!!!,"I cannot say enough about this hotel!! It is very small (I think only about 25 rooms?) because they want to be able to cater to your EVERY need. The staff is able to accommodate your needs better when the ratio is about one staff member per room. Not only is it very quaint and unassuming on the outside (as famous as this place is, none of the taxi drivers knew where it was?? I had to name the hotel NEXT DOOR, and then they knew where to take me) but it is beautiful on the inside!! Dark wood, rich fabrics, fireplaces. The common area is where you go every night to ""plunder the pantry"" (which translates to FREE FOOD!) cocktails and gourmet snacks. And the service could not be better!! Whatever you need, they will get it (even if they have to walk 6 blocks to get it elsewhere and‚Ä¶"
October 2014,Simply the best,"Love this hotel. The staff, the rooms, the honesty bar, the champagne on arrival, the breakfast, the all day snacks to take out and the evening hot snacks, absolute attention to detail.  Brilliantly located next to all the sites. Personal touches were excellent as we had a special occasion on one of the weekends we stayed.   Can't wait to go again soon  "
August 2015,Outstanding Dirty Gin Martinis at the 41.,"The 41 is a lovely discrete boutique hotel. The staff are very friendly and attentive and they mix the best DGM (Dirty Gin Martini). The hotel has a genteel ambiance and it was great to be able to come back after a show and 'raid the pantry'. A wonderful 3 days and thank you for the bottle of bubbles on my birthday, very thoughtful."
June 2015,Back again ,What can i say about this hotel this got to be only of the best hotel in London and their getting better and better the rooms are very nice and very clean the beds are very nice and comfortable as well this is my second visit in a few month and it won't be the last 
August 2015,Simply delightful,"Our stay at Hotel 41 was delightful even before we checked in for a four day weekend to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. A few days prior to our arrival I received a preference questionnaire: Were we celebrating a special occasion? Did we want feather or foam pillows? Would I like some flowers delivered to the room? Would we like a car arranged to pick us up at the airport? This was indicative of the hotel's attention to detail.  The staff at Hotel 41 are serious about service.  If you have a preference, they will oblige you and remember your choice.  Rather than having a separate number for room service, housekeeping, etc., there is simply the ""Whatever, whenever"" button on your telephone. Why would you want or need anything else?  At breakfast our second morning,‚Ä¶"
June 2015,Comfort and Style !!!!!,"This is definitely the best Hotel in London! My grandson and I returned this past June for our yearly European Trip. We absolutely love it! This is our third year staying at the 41 Hotel. Upon our arrival we were greeted by the same wonderful staff who are so friendly and accommodating to us every year. The Hotel is very beautiful with it's black and white d√©cor which is classy and elegant. I have traveled around the world and I've stayed in a lot of nice Hotel but this one by far is the finest and it is truly because of the staff at this hotel they truly pride themselves in excellent customer service and kindness.  Jeffrey Shaner Las Vegas, Nevada"
August 2015,Small and perfectly formed!,"I've had the pleasure of staying on 41 on a number of occasions now,  we had a wonderful weekend this month to celebrate our 21st wedding anniversary.  It's still a joy to walk into the hushed lobby and be escorted upstairs and offered a choice of fine champagne while you relax and check in. As a repeat visitor it was great that a number of staff remembered me from the last visit and it's like catching up with an old friend. The bottle of champagne provided by the hotel on hearing of our anniversary was a lovely gesture and really appreciated  - Louis Roderer, my favourite as it happens.  Everyone here is so helpful and it's always nice to see the GM at breakfast maintaining a quiet but approachable presence which is not the case at many 5 star establishments.  The balance‚Ä¶"
August 2015,Nice Stay,Having read all the reviews on trip adviser i was really expecting something very special to other five star properties that i have stayed at over the years but this didn't happen The Property is well maintained and the staff as a whole are great a special mention to Dixion who was fantastic however i thought the front desk as they did not have a separate conceirge was not as knowledgable as others i have stayed at. The bedroom was well appointed with a nice sized bathroom and plenty of hanging space and well maintained  The Breakfast was very good and the Burger for lunch is probably one of the best i have ever had 41 is small and intermit and we enjoyed our stay
August 2015,Service Perfection,"We spent a long weekend visiting London and made Hotel 41 our base. We stayied in the Conservatory suite. From the moment of arrival the service was exceptional. All the staff are very friendly, remember your names, take an interest in what you are doing and nothing is too much trouble. Excellent breakfasts, great afternoon tea and the most comfortable bed I have slept on, in any hotel, anywhere, ever. Highly recommended."
July 2015,Oh Dear--Too Good!!,"First time and had some expectations, but-WOW!--this establishment is both sophisticated, elegant, and yet, fun. Staff is excellent, the food first-class, the suite was exemplary in every detail (where are the nicks and scratches on the furniture, why isn't the carpeting stained, why is everything just right!?). I cannot say enough about my stay and it contributed so much to enjoying my London vacation.  Thank you, 41--I'll be back,"
August 2015,Perfect in every way,"I can't be positive enough about my experience at 41. I chose it as the location for me to propose to my girlfriend and everything was perfect.  Within days of booking and leaving a note stating my intentions, I was personally contacted by a lovely guy called Remus, who proceeded to help me plan every details of the day. He was fantastic and really set my mind at ease and assured me all would be well.  When we actually arrived on the day, every single member of staff was lovely and seemed genuinely like they wanted to help. Nothing was too much to ask. They really know how to provide great service. I won't spoil any surprises, but some of the services that come complimentary with your stay are just top notch as well.  The room was pristine and luxurious with an enormous bed and‚Ä¶"
July 2015,Treated like royalty!,"Hotel 41 was probably the loveliest hotel we have stayed in.  The staff were exceptional in so many ways. Knowing us by name right away, helping us with bookings and information about things to see and do, gracious service at the breakfasts and afternoon tea.  The room was so well appointed and spacious. A delicious birthday dessert in our room, a turn down at night with red roses and rose petals, plunder the pantry for late night snacking in the beautiful Executive Lounge.  We could go on and on.  The location across from Buckingham Palace is perfect!  I would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat!"
June 2015,Like a Private Club,"We recently stopped over in London for 3 nights after a trip to Europe.  We totally enjoyed our stay at this outstanding hotel.  If you are expecting a grand lobby, multiple restaurants, hundreds of rooms and numerous amenities, you may be disappointed.  This is a small, say 30 room hotel, located within the Ruben's Hotel just across from the Buckingham Palace Mews.  It has the ambiance of a private club. The rooms and facilities are very nice and the location is perfect. What sets this hotel apart and made our stay very pleasant was quite simply the wonderful staff.  From our arrival to our departure the entire staff made our visit pleasant and enjoyable.  They provided excellent restaurant recommendations and tips on sightseeing. We would definitely return again."
June 2015,Impossible. ..,"It seems impossible to describe in words just how fabulous this hotel is.  From the moment you arrive,  you are treated as a special  guest.  Your favorite beverages are provided along with lovely appetizers.  The ""plunder the pantry"" option is the perfect way to end the evening.  Our room was spacious by London standards and furnished with every thing you might possibly need. The bathroom was quite spacious and light.   I left the hotel less than a week ago and already I miss Stefan,  Mitchell, and Dickson!  Thanks for making our stay so grand! "
June 2015,In a League Of Its Own!,"So after 8 years of using Tripadvisor to give me all the best tips and information for all my trips without ever giving back to the TA community through reviews of my own, a hotel has finally come along that has given my lazy self no choice but to post.    Hotel 41 is hands down the best hotel experience I have ever had.  Being a consultant, I have stayed at all the top branded 5 star properties and was truly blown away during my recent stay at Hotel 41 for my 1 yr anniversary. WOW!   Many have said it before me, but what sets Hotel 41 apart is their remarkable client service.  Every single hotel staff you encounter will be dedicated to providing the best service they are able to and make it look so effortless.  From the minute I stepped into the doors until the minute I left I‚Ä¶"
June 2015,An Outstanding Experience!,"Hotel 41 far exceeded my expectations!!  The staff was extremely helpful, the accommodations were beyond compare and the overall experience was more than worth the few extra dollars that it cost.  The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Parliament and many other sites.  I would stay there again."
March 2015,one of the best in London,this is so amazing. I really love it. the staffs are so professional. This is for the guests who love design and luxury style. facilities is so nice. I love everything about this hotel. I definitely come back here again soon.
May 2015,Wonderful Staff and Impeccable Service,"What a wonderful hotel. This is a real gem in London. It is the fifth floor of Ruben‚Äôs hotel (the converted ballroom), but it has its own private entrance and staff. We were a little concerned about the location (having previously stayed mainly in Kensington and Mayfair): it is close to Victoria Station, but also has another fine address close by in Buckingham Palace Road.  Although busy, the location was good, and it is only a few minutes‚Äô walk to the underground. Our whole experience here was just perfect. From the time of arrival when you are met at the front door, whisked up the lift to the executive lounge where check-in is undertaken while drinking a lovely glass of champagne. Then escorted to your room where the luggage is already in place and a large bowl of fruit and‚Ä¶"
June 2015,Splendid! ! !,"The hotel is great!!!! I stayed for the second time and finally decided to give my review. Is one of those hotels that you don't mind what you'll pay at the end if the day. Because it deserves it all. Everything is so So SO amazing. The rooms,  the staff all the hotel areas and the location too. We were really glad that we had the chance to stay here again. We feel so lucky. That's what all the hotels should look and operate like. A stay will make you gain the same opinion. Thanks to the management and the staff for an unforgettable 2nd stay...!!!!"
June 2015,Marvelous one week stay,We spent the last week of May at Hotel 41 and was thrilled with our stay. The service was impeccable and we enjoyed the cosy boutique atmosphere of the establishment. All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly and we felt like home. We were able to get last minute tickets for plays and restaurant reservation. It goes to show that what makes a great hotel is the ground staff who runs the premise. It is a hotel that we will certainly look forward to stay when we next visit London. 
June 2015,High quality throughout,"Had a great visit last week, my first stay. Everything is just done to excellence. The rooms are absolute luxury as you would expect from a hotel of this rating. I will definitely be returning soon. The only thing I would do differently is stay longer."
June 2015,Simply the best hotel I have ever stayed in bar none!,"Without seeming to boast, I have stayed in some of the best hotels in over 45 countries and been blown away by a few, but nothing compares to 41. If like me you read the 'Terribles' first (Mostly for fun) you will understand that '41' is located on the 5th floor of the 'Rubens' hotel and has a separate entrance. No problem for us; in fact the uniqueness was intriguing and original which is always a good start. When you get to the lounge/reception, you enter a small club like environment and are welcomed by a choice of 4 champagnes whilst formalities are swiftly dealt with. You feel immediately welcome and individual.  You are looked after by genuine, engaging people (I cannot bring myself to call them staff) who really care that you enjoy your stay. If you are looking for the‚Ä¶"
June 2015,Outstanding Experience,"My husband and I traveled to Europe for our very first time and as a part of our stay we booked several nights at Hotel 41. Based on previous reviews I had extremely high expectations and not only were they met, they were exceeded. This is not your ordinary hotel, this is an experience. The moment you walk in you know this is going to be something special. From the detailed amenities in the room, to the lovely breakfasts and afternoon cocktail hours you never want to leave. Do not look elsewhere, if you can book a reservation, do it now, you will not be disappointed."
June 2015,Wonderful,My daughter and son in law booked an overnight stay in Hotel 41 as a 60 th birthday present to begin our trip on the Orient Express. What an amazing start to a trip of a lifetime.  Luxury and excellent service Staff were wonderful. Food excellent ( loved the gin and tonic ice cream) Nothing was too much trouble.  Will definitely book to stay here again
June 2015,Good service,Hotel 41 has very good service. Service in London can be very hit and miss in London and the rest or England. So it was very nice to have some personal service. The rooms are cosy but space in London is a premium. I noticed they took the time out to talk to guests especially the solo travellers and seemed quite genuine. 
June 2015,AMAZING! WONDERFUL! EXCELLENCE!,This is the best place to stay in London. We were on a trip in honor of our 40th wedding anniversary.  We feel so fortunate we stayed at Hotel 41. The hotel went out of its way to make it a special week. We enjoyed a cake one night and a romantic candle lit room on another night! They provide a fresh fruit plate each day which really was nice. The executive lounge had snack during the day. My husband loved the ice cream that was available. We are just a middle class working couple but staying at this hotel is well worth the cost. We saved a long time for this trip and starting it off in London at Hotel 41 just reinforced our belief that this will be the vacation of a lifetime!  Thank you to all the wonderful staff. A special thanks to Mr. Otto who made my husband feel at ease‚Ä¶
June 2015,Truly Amazing,"We‚Äôve recently returned from a 4 night break celebrating our 20th Wedding Anniversary and from the minute you arrive to the moment you (sadly have to) leave, you are treated like a VIP guest.  Attentive staff, attention to detail and immaculate rooms & lounge area make this a truly amazing experience.   The best hotel we‚Äôve ever stayed in and now our number one choice for a London break ‚Äì Hotel 41 has raised the bar!"
May 2015,A perfect Boutique Hotel,"A wonderful stay...a very personal, small hotel.  A very nice accommodation, supported by a personable, professional, and helpful staff.  I know we are missing some names, but Magda, Lauren, Stephanie, and Stefan were a joy. The ""library"" area is most charming and relaxing.  We felt like a little of home.  It was a special treat since returning to our old London neighborhood from 10 years prior.  The ""bbar"" restaurant is excellent, and We would recommend Ffiona's French Bistro on Kensington Church Street to anyone who likes a small, intimate, and great food restaurant."
December 2014,Very nice hotel,"Very good hotel! we went there with my husband for our wedding anniversary and we had a great time. The hotel is great, people are very nice, and the breakfast is the best!! the only bummer was that they made us a reservation for an afternoon tea at another hotel, and when we arrived there, they had a long wait, so we had to leave, though this wasn't 41 hotel fault, they made that reservation for us... but all the other thing were great!"
June 2015,Service beyond any expectation,"I‚Äôm really torn on providing my feedback on this hotel.  My family and I just spent 4 nights at the ""41"".  I consider it more of a private club than just a hotel.  If everyone were to experience the level of service and genuine hospitality that my family did, then it would surely be everyone‚Äôs top choice to stay while in London, and my ability to get future reservations will be severely diminished.    If you want to stay at a large hotel where no one calls you by name, doesn't remember your favorite drink, and charges you for club access, then this is not the hotel for you.  If exceptional personalized service is what you are looking for, then there is no better hotel in London.  When in London this is where I will stay."
May 2015,"More than a luxurious hotel, it is the welcome home every traveler hopes to find.","We were greeted by friendly, warm people who offered refreshments (available all day) as we rested in the cushy leather furnishings of the lobby/lounge. There are substantial, old-world tables that look and feel as if they were created for the space where you can enjoy the excellent food and drink. Our room and bath were charming and beyond comfortable. However, the most outstanding feature of this hotel is the staff! Stefan, Stephanie, Lauren, and everyone else who helped us get tickets to plays, taxis, detailed directions, etc. we're fabulous. We will return to this amazing, unique establishment."
June 2015,"Classy, Old Style Hotel in the Heart of the City","A special place to stay when visiting London. Located almost across the street from the palace, this hotel offers old world charm, fantastic service and all day food and drink. All rooms are located on one floor so getting a room can require advanced booking. The rooms were well adorned and the service was above expectations."
May 2015,Excellent service as usual.,"I have had the pleasure of staying at 41 on a number of occasions now and the level of hospitality is always excellent.  It's quite important to understand what this hotel is, and what it is not when looking to book.  This is not a large hotel with statement lobby and public areas, spa, gym and restaurants on site. There are plenty of other 5 stars options in London to meet these requirements.  This is a place to walk around in your slippers, a cross between  a private club and your own home with exceptional hospitality. Perfect for my own needs.  There is still some building work going on in the area which can be a little intrusive so it's best to check the very latest situation with the hotel. I did comment on the noise level and Moniker acted immediately to remove some‚Ä¶"
May 2015,#1 Hotel in London Exceeds Expectations,"I stayed here for 3 nights and I had a group of 9 people booked on this trip (we had 9 rooms). Customer service is their mantra! From the moment we walked in to the moment we checked out, every single detail, things you don't even think of, were taken care of. You can call room service for coffee and it was pretty much at your room before you even hung up the phone.  Room: the size of the room isn't large but much larger than you would expect being in prime location across the Royal Mews. Very clean, orderly and the most comfortable bed and pillows I've experienced in a while.  Food: quality of food and the service at the lounge was great. I really enjoyed their breakfast.   Executive Lounge: this is where you come to relax, eat, drink or have a quiet chat. This lounge was the‚Ä¶"
April 2015,"Small size, great service and comfort","This gem across from the Royal Mews offers first class service from all the staff, top to bottom.  No question or request is too small.  Our room, though not large, was luxurious and had every thoughtful amenity, and the bath with large tub and large shower was elegantly fitted out.  Highly recommended if you love a small, quiet hotel with top notch personal service."
January 2015,Superb again,"There is a reason why this is the best hotel in London, the staff. Every member of staff from the concierge to the maintenance man offers the unobtrusive excellence in customer service that other larger establishments can only dream of. Our second visit, this time for my birthday, last year was for my husbands birthday, I cannot recommend Hotel 41 highly enough and we are already planning next years visit"
May 2015,Simply the Best,"We have stayed at 41 for a number of years now on our frequent trips to London. This boutique luxury hotel is a gem.   Quite simply the best at personal service, atmosphere, and luxury.  Mr. Hendry's staff raises the bar on service to levels rarely experienced in any field these days.  The rooms are unique due to the nature of the building, and some reviews commenting upon size are unfair. The architecture, decor, and feel is that of London.  This is not a large property, and the small number of rooms allow for an intimate feeling of a personal club.  The staff focus on your personal wishes with discrete service that exceeds all expectations.  Every need is attended with professionalism and friendliness.  We can't wait to return!"
April 2015,"Excellent service,ambience & anticipation","I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. I cant speak highly enough of the staff & their anticipation of my needs. Being a single middle aged traveller I was looked after incredibly well. The staff seemed to anticipate what I needed & action it to make such a wonderful stay. From the beautiful breakfasts to the liesurely late afternoon drinks in the lounge, everything was perfect. The rooms are very comfortable & to return after a busy day, to sliced lemon, lime, olives & a bucket of ice & fresh water bottles was just brilliant.Just nothing was too much trouble, the best discreet, friendly service I have ever encountered at some of the finest hotels. Congratulations to the staff & management for making my stay such a wonderful experience."
April 2015,A relaxing oasis in busy London,"We recently stayed four nights at Hotel 41. When we travel we usually do not spend much time in our hotel, but the care and friendly attention we received at ""41"" enticed us to return each day.  The staff is outstanding (thank you Malcolm, Lauren, Monika and everyone whose name I cannot remember) and they all deserve the rave reviews they have received from other guests.  Every question, request or whim is treated seriously and responded to immediately.  After a long day of travel to London it was delightful to be offered a glass of chilled champagne while our bags were taken to our room.  Our executive king room was roomy (particularly for a European city hotel), comfortable, and extremely quiet.  The location between Buckingham Palace (across the street) and Victoria Station‚Ä¶"
April 2015,We very much liked this hotel,"We recently had the pleasure of spending three nights at Hotel 41.  The hotel is very well located across the street from Buckngham Palace.  The service could not have been better and the staff was friendy and very accomodating.  We give this ony 4 stars because of the size of the room, and the lack of a lobby at street level, but we would highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again when we return to London."
December 2014,The Mini Moon of our dreams,"My new husband and I wanted to spend a couple of special days together immediately after our Christmas Wedding (December 2014). London was our choice and we were given many recommendations from friends but we really wanted to stay at a boutique hotel and found some great reviews for 41. How could we resist 'the most romantic hotel in London'? Our two nights at 41 were the highlight of our year and the most fantastic stay we've ever had at a hotel. The most perfect way to start our married life together. My husband and I were blown away by the wonderful service and attention to detail, from every single member of staff. We were addressed by name by everyone at all times and the welcome was lovely, with a glass of champagne. Nothing was too much trouble. We loved how the staff‚Ä¶"
April 2015,Nothing short of perfection,"Can I add anything to the excellent reviews already provided? No, not really but I feel that I am obliged to share our excellent stay with those who might be considering staying at the 41 - consider no further and go for it. You are very welcome there, genially welcome. Some of the rooms might be a bit on the small side (ours was great) but very well appointed and cater to needs you didn¬¥t know you had. The staff is the best you come around in the hospitality business - nothing is to much ask, and by some miracle they manage to exceed the high expectations one has after reading the reviews. I read a small booklet they have on the RCH and as I understand the founder is very keen on her guests feeling special and happy about their stay. Well, Mrs Tollman, if you read this (which I‚Ä¶"
March 2015,Unforgettable Stay,"I had booked this hotel to propose my other half. I contacted the hotel several months in advance to see if they could assist me with arranging the music, roses, get our favorite champagne in the room and deal with numerous other details I was trying to get together. Their response from the start was amazing - every single thing was exactly how I had hoped for. They went for that extra mile by putting together a sound system that worked for my music - they didn't have this in place initially.  We got upgraded to a stunning room that was on two levels, had a lovely sitting area downstairs with a fire place and then bedroom and bathroom upstairs. Very large, super-comfy bed and two separate showers & large bath tub.  When we returned in the evening they had set everything ready as‚Ä¶"
February 2015,Best stay in the heart of London,"We were spending a weekend i London, and Hotel 41 was a perfect choice both because of its location and the ""boutique"" interior. We were welcome with the glass of champagne by the friendly and professional stuff. The room was big enough and the bathroom very comfortable. Gorgeous classical interior of the launch was just a prick over ""i"". Loved everything!"
March 2015,Two Nights of Indulgence,"Spent 2 nights here with my wife over the weekend and had an amazing time. The hotel feels small and personal, and the staff are incredible friendly, attentive knowledgeable and courteous.   Our room was wonderful with an extremely comfortable bed and a huge bath plus separate walk-in shower.  We really enjoyed the welcome drinks, the pantry and the honesty bar. Breakfast was excellent.  Location-wise its practically next door to Buckingham Palace so a great place to explore London from.   We have also stayed at The Ritz and The Savoy and this place is definitely up there with them, but with a bit more of a personal touch."
March 2015,Wonderful Experience!!,"My mother and I stayed at Hotel 41 for 3 days while we were visiting London and it was such an incredible experience. The room was delightful and large enough to accommodate both of us comfortably, the food was delicious, and above all, the service level provided by the staff was unparalleled. The staff is genuine, kind, incredibly attentive, and warm. They went out of their way to assist us with any needs we had (even going to lengths of going to the Starbucks down the street and picking out a mug as a souvenir for a friend when all I asked was if they could see if there was a Starbucks in the airport terminal) and to ensure that our stay was as pleasant and care free as possible. I really looking forward to returning to Hotel 41 and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a‚Ä¶"
March 2015,Wonderful Birthday Weekend,"Cannot speak highly enough of this hotel. Everything about it was perfect. The service was exemplary - nothing was too much trouble. The room was fantastic, every detail covered. It was the little things that made it though.... The birthday cake in the room, the upgrade to a suite for our special occasion, the champagne on arrival, the lit fire when we returned to our room in the evening and the complementary tea and scones just before we left for our return journey. We WILL be back!!!!"
February 2015,"Beautiful Accommodation, Great Location, Wonderful Staff","My wife and I spent four days last month at Hotel 41 in London, and very much look forward to returning!  Our room was attractive and comfortable.  The lounge was a great respite after a day of sightseeing and shopping with plenty to eat and drink.  The location was ideal whether walking, hailing a cab, or taking the Tube.  The staff was incredibly attentive, friendly, and helpful, whether with restaurant recommendations, directions, or virtually any question asked.  And they were wonderful to simply have a conversation with as well.  We had let them know in advance we were celebrating our anniversary and were very pleasantly surprised to find a celebratory cake awaiting us on arrival, as well as scattered rose pedals and votive candles throughout the room after dinner our first‚Ä¶"
March 2015,A little gem,"Seleted Hotel 41 from Tripadvsor reviews and I can confirm it justly deserves its position on the list.On arrival were speedily shown to the 5th floor executive lounge where the check in process is completed.Whilst we were being checked in we were offered a choice of champagne .We then spent some time enjoying the ambiance off he executive lounge with complementary nibbles and more champagne.When we were ready we were shown to our room 4104 the conservatory suite.Everything in the suite was explained to us nothing was rushed .The suite was incredible , arranged over 2 floors with a sitting room on the lower level with a nice couch a mini bar and TV also a toilet.On the upper floor a massive bedroom with the conservatory roof so you can sleep under the stars or close the blinds‚Ä¶"
March 2015,Fabulous and Personal,"Thank you so much to Hotel 41 for an amazing stay over my birthday.  The room was stunning and made even more so with the fire and rose petals in the evening!  Made our stay so special with all those personal touches, including theatre merchandise, roses, our fav magazines and a birthday cake!  Breakfast was absolutely delicious, were still talking about it.  Will definitely be coming back and recommending to friends and family alike!"
March 2015,Cozy and Fabulous,"I have just spent a week in this  gorgeous Hotel. It is perfect in every way! The staff make this  hotel, they cannot do enough to spoil you. The rooms are beautifully appointed and the breafasts are gorgeous! I could list far more than 41 reasons to stay! Just book you won't be dissapointed!"
February 2015,Fantastic service and stay ,"Stayed here with the other half, we both thoroughly enjoyed our time here. Service was fantastic and someone was always there when required. Room service efficient and not intrusive. The whole decor of the place was amazing felt as if we was in a different country and not in London. This is one of the best hotels in London at the moment. Will be back again in the summer. Thanks "
January 2015,Best service I've ever experienced,"The hotel is comfortable, well decorated and reasonably well positioned in Victoria. What sets it apart is the service. It's amazing. I travel a lot with work and have stayed in excellent hotels all over the World. This really stands out. They anticipate your needs and are generous with their champagne, snacks and excellent coffee. They are also friendly and very helpful. We had a wonderful time."
December 2014,Stunning luxury!!,I first wrote a review on Hotel 41 about 4 or 5 years ago and could not stop recommending it to everyone that I knew.  We had the opportunity to return in December whilst doing some Christmas shopping in London and it is as magnificent as ever!  We stayed in a Junior Suite and I would like to share our experiences as follows: Location:  Hotel 41 is situated in Buckingham Palace Road and is just around the corner from Buckingham Palace.  We never caught cabs anywhere as it is so easy to walk to places such as Hyde Park and Harrods.  Longer walks would include walking to Fortnum and Mason - totally lovely! The staff:  We had not been there for two years and were so happy to see familiar faces at the reception desk.  The friendliness and the helpfulness of the staff cannot be‚Ä¶
December 2014,Fantastic&romantic,"Very nice little butique hotel with helpful stuff. Room was very cosy, with fireplace and comfort bed. Location was the best. It was only couple hundred metres away from Buckingham Palace and short walk away from Victoria bus station. Hop on-hop off bus station was almost in front of the hotel. Loved to spend our christmas time there, hotel lobby was also very cosy and stuff spoiled us a lot. Definately will visit again."
January 2015,51st Wedding Anniversary,"This has to be the best hotel in London,we were celebrating our 51st anniversary and spent one night at Hotel 41.From the moment you enter the hotel and receive the unique registration format (crudit√©s and champagne) to the exceptional room facilities, it's the first hotel We have visited that have sanitised TV controls in sealed plastic bags.We would also congratulate the highly professional and friendly staff. Do visit Hotel 41 it's amazing!"
January 2015,A hidden treasure,What a find!! We stayed for two nights and we had a great time. We were met by the doorman as we pulled up. Luggage taken into the hotel and the car was whisked away. We were greeted by name by the staff who were really attentive. If you're not used to it you could feel a little overwhelmed but with only 28 rooms the staff have plenty of time to look after you. We had a glass of champagne whilst we were checking in and complimentary snacks whilst we waited for our room. The executive lounge is very tastefully laid out and never too busy so it feels like you're in an exclusive club. Be aware that although the snacks and cold drinks are free the tea and coffee that they offer certainly aren't and are added onto the bill without a word....no slip to sign so we were surprised when‚Ä¶
January 2015,Discreet and exceptional service.,"We had 2 nights here for a birthday weekend of shopping and partying. The service for us is unrivalled and we are used to being spoiled having recently stayed in the Savoy and the Sanderson. Loved the executive lounge, really can't wait to return to spend a little more time making the most of it. Thankyou to all of the staff for a wonderful stay."
February 2014,Ultra High Quality,"Stayed here in February 2013 in a fantastic two-floor room. Entrance through a nice seating area with a fireplace, spacious bedroom in the top floor. Nice 1920's surroundings in the lounge, breakfast is generous and the afternoon canap√©s is a feature rarely seen in London establishments."
December 2014,A JEWEL OF THE CROWN,"A JEWEL OF THE CROWN  (IN THE MOST LITERAL SENSE OF THE EXPRESSION ! )  Following the online reservation of rooms on the website for 3 nights of the Hotel, communication with the staff prior to arrival was most informative and kind, helpful and attentive to all our requests. I had planned this journey for my partner‚Äôs birthday and I could already feel that the staff paid attention to every wish I would formulate. Moreover, they arranged for private transfer to pick us up from the airport upon arrival, as indeed I had requested.   As soon as we arrived at the hotel, Mr Malcolm Hendry, General Manager, came outside to greet us and even kindly helped us with our luggage himself (!!). Once we got into the ground-floor hall we knew we would absolutely love the place. Mr Hendry told‚Ä¶"
December 2014,5/5 isn't enough - 100/100,"We stayed early December 2014. Not only would I say this is the best hotel in London, I'd say it's the best hotel I've stayed in in the UK and Europe.  We stayed for our 10 year anniversary. We checked in and sat in the lounge while the excellent staff sorted our room.  We was shown to the room where all our belongings was waiting, with a happy anniversary card.  The hotel is totally stunning, and I see a lot of buildings as a surveyor. Everything is spotless. The food is second to none, and the restaurant next door, Bbar, - wow.  I cannot thank all the staff enough for making our stay a totally amazing experience.   My only regret is not being able to thank all the members of staff that we had the pleasure of meeting during our 4 day stay. We will definitely be returning to‚Ä¶"
December 2014,Nine days (and nights) in heaven,"After reading the rave reviews online, we decided to give this hotel a try.  It was even better than we had hoped for.  From the welcome with champagne to our final breakfast before our departure, we were treated like royalty.  (The hotel is literally just down the street from Buckingham Palace, and at times, we could swear that we must actually be guests of the Queen, staying within her private domain.)  The atmosphere is one similar to that of a fine gentlemen's club in the Saint James district.  The main room, called the Executive Lounge, is filled with beautiful mahogany furniture and features comfortable seating, a cozy fireplace, and a very attentive staff always available to help.  The service is outstanding but understated.  Help seems to appear magically just as it is‚Ä¶"
February 2015,A very special place,From start to finish our stay was faultless. It's expensive but worth every penny. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The location makes this a true hidden gem in the heart of London. We will definitely be returning 
February 2015,Unbelievable!,"I can not even begin to write a review that would do Hotel 41 and staff justice.  The suite was stunning with views of the Palace Mews out of our windows.  There was nothing better than returning to our room in the evening, after a long day of sight seeing, to a fire and warm bath.  The staff were always warm and welcoming.  No matter the request, they never batted an eye and fulfilled it wonderfully. Our stay here was more like staying with long time friends than staying at a hotel.  The location was fabulous.  Easy walk to the underground, Victoria Station, Buckingham Palace, Harrods, The Victoria and Albert Museum, Big Ben and Westminster Abby.  Quick cab or Uber to other sights.  I hesitate to say more...I can't wait to return and don't want it to be fully booked!"
February 2015,Hidden Gem next to the Royal Palace,"Look carefully to find the unassuming entrance door to this hidden gem.  My husband and I stayed here one night to celebrate our 25th Anniversary.  From the moment you step in the door you feel like you're stealing away to someplace special.  The service was impeccable with attention to the tiniest of details.  There is always something delicious to eat available.  I am most impressed and grateful, however, that when we returned at midnight, I asked if they might have a spare contact lens case because I forgot mine . . . and they were able to provide me with one!!  That was a lifesaver.  I wish we were able to stay longer."
February 2015,Magical place,"This time to hotel 41 my daughter and I were celebrating her 21 birthday and the staff made sure she had an amazing stay . On greeting her they wished her happy birthday and in our room we found cake plus a card and balloon . The hotel is unique , you know your in london due to location but once your through the doors its another world hidden from outside . The personal touches from the staff are second to none and they make your stay memorable . We saw billy elliot and on our return found cupcakes and a programme . The quality of everything is outstanding and its just perfect in every way for me from staff to room to food and drink . The communications from hotel 41 are excellent they go the extra mile on everything . I am very hard to impress but they did it . My daughter 21‚Ä¶"
February 2015,beautiful,"This is my first time here, and the first thing i noticed is the hotel's nice decoration, especially at the lobby ... the kind of old school feel that i like! definitely suitable for all occasions ..."
February 2015,"""Paradise Lost?"" I believe I have found it!","We were fortunate enough to discover Hotel 41 in February of this year. I can only endorse every positive thing that has been written about this hotel. The place is absolutely beautiful,the rooms are gorgeous and spotlessly clean, the food is fabulous, the location fantastic, I could go on and on! However in my opinion what really makes this Hotel truly exceptional is the wonderful staff that they employ.,it is hard to believe that one hotel has managed to employ an entire staff who are truly exceptional in every way. We did not encounter a single member of staff who wasn't smiling and genuinely interested in making sure our weekend was as wonderful as possible. Well ladies and gentlemen you succeeded! Thank you all so much for making us so comfortable , so welcome and making‚Ä¶"
March 2015,Always a fantastic experience,This was our 3rd time at Hotel 41. Tube journey from Euston to Victoria a nightmare and the building work in Victoria horrendous and ugly. However the moment you step into the lobby of  Hotel 41 you  feel calm and so well looked after. Other hotels may be equally luxurious and well run but somehow  because it is smaller and individual you feel special. We are already talking about out next stay.
February 2015,One of the best ever.......,"I have just got back from a truly amazing stay at this fab hotel. We've stayed in some of the worlds best hotels and I can honestly say this was one of the best experiences we've ever had at a hotel. My husband booked this place as a birthday treat for me, after reading the reviews on here and I'm so glad he did. It was magical. On arrival we were greeted with a selection of champagne by the most attentive staff. We then had our room upgraded for nothing as my husband had informed them it was my birthday. We were given an amazing suite which was gorgeous in every way. The rooms really are exceptional. The decor & attention to detail is wonderful. They then arrived with a birthday cake (which was delicious) and fruit basket as a present. All of this in the 1st 30 mins! In the‚Ä¶"
February 2015,Perfection,"I stayed here with my good friend for my birthday treat and they really go the extra mile. It is my favourite place in the world. Nothing is too much trouble and the food, ambience, rooms, service and location is flawless. Thank you so much again for the best stay ever. We did not want to leave ever. "
February 2015,Everything about this hotel is first class. ," Everything about this hotel is first class. Have stayed several times and once again we were not disappointed. We really enjoyed our first stay with the hotel so much so that we extended it by three days! The staff was very helpful in particular. They were very helpful answering questions as well as making recommendations. There were lovely setting, clean and spacious room. Food is excellent. The spa is way above all others I have visited. I had great time. Also, there was a lovely afternoon tea. Thanks a lot and I will definitely come back."
October 2014,Another Perfect Stay At London's Hidden Gem,"There is very little I can say that I haven't already said about this wonderful property. The staff perfectly exemplify never-say-no hospitality, with each and every member of staff taking the time to better know and understand their guests. The dining was excellent as always, as were the provisions on the pantry.  Overall another lovely stay at 41 and I will no doubt return."
October 2014,Excellent,Stayed for our anniversary. The staff couldn't be more helpful and welcoming. Our room was small but comfortable and had everything you could possibly need. Only had breakfast but couldn't fault it. Will definitely stay again and would recommend to anyone.
October 2014,EXCELLENT jewel in London!,"Hotel 41 is a lovely jewel in London.  Fantastic location near Buckingham Palace!  Amazing service, food, rooms...PURE GRACIOUS HOSPITALITY!!!!  It feels like home!  From the champagne welcome throughout each day's amenities, Hotel 41 has it all.  A quiet, lovely respite in the midst of busy London!"
October 2014,Overdue review!,"I've stayed here with my wife at least 20 times in the last few years, and will always look to 41 first when booking a place for myself or friends.  While the amazing rooms and common spaces come as standard and outshine the other top hotels in London, it is the personal service and welcoming team looking after us during our stays that always stand out.    They remember us by name, face, and even voice on the phone after years between bookings!  They know what we like and don't like, and prepare our room accordingly in advance whenever we are staying there.  For example, at my wife's suggestion, they provide a free standing full length mirror which is already in situ when we get to our room (the ladies will appreciate this, I am led to believe).    Simply a super hotel with all‚Ä¶"
October 2014,Posh and service-oriented hotel very close to Buckingham Palace.,"The staff are excellent at the hotel- everyone gets to know you and tries to assist you in any way they can. The rooms are comfortable and well-appointed. Soft towels and comfortable sheet/bedding.  There is a lounge area which is stocked with drinks and snacks 24 hours a day and that offers meals and cocktails as well as tea. The room we booked had air conditioning problems the first night of our stay and the staff moved us to a new room that was larger and even more beautiful. They gave us complimentary champagne and waived our first night's charge because of the AC problem. While we were at dinner, the staff lit candles and placed rose petals throughout our room . They went well above and beyond our expectations. We will definitely return!"
October 2014,Wonderful,"I stayed at this lovely hotel last week and it was a truly superb and decadent experience.  As soon as you walk in the door you feel taken care of.  The executive lounge and the rooms themselves are luxurious and you feel totally pampered.  From check in with champagne, to the plunder the pantry, there was nothing that was missed.  The staff is wonderful and they pay close attention to detail.  My room was lovely with a view of the Royal Mews.  Located about a 5 minute walk from Victoria Station, I was able to navigate the tube to all the wonderful landmarks.  I will definitely be visiting again and I can see why they earned this rating on trip advisor.  Truly a classic elegant hotel.  Can't wait to visit again."
August 2014,Very very excellent.,IT ios in the prime place for a hotel and the rooms are spotless. The staff treat you well and it deserves all the acclodaes that it has received. All the services are propt and friendly. Not a big hotel but the roomsc are a fair size. Hotels in London are expensive.
September 2014,Fantastic Hotel!!,"Two weeks ago my husband, my son and me, we were at the Hotel 41, and everything was perfect, in the 3 days we stayed there.. The big smile in our arrival, the welcome cocktail, our amazing suite!! The cozy lobby and the great service in all our request, every one was promptly resolved and always with an incredible attention and great smile.  Usually we are going to London 3 times a year, And this was our first visit to the Hotel 41, was great we did it!..  For sure in our next visit to London,  we will back to this beautiful and charming Hotel !!  Thank you Piero, Remus, Simone, Paula, Yohann, Mitchel and Stefanie, every one of you made to us feeling like at home with all your attentions and great service!!  Marcela F."
October 2014,A gem in the heart of London,What a remarkable hotel.  From the minute we arrived it felt like home.  On arrival we were greeted at the door with a glass of sherry and from that moment on we were totally pampered.  I was a bit nervous about booking a hotel in that price bracket but I was not disappointed and will certainly be staying here next time I visit London.  The beautiful lounge was like being at home curled up with a magazine.  Totally worth the money.
October 2014,A one night stop over for a special event,"I booked 41 after googling ""best hotel in London"" as I had a special occasion in London. The booking process was excellent and the lady on the telephone was very attentive.the location is a 4 minute walk from Victoria station. On arrival the whole experience started to snowball into sensory overload. The staff are fabulous, the facilities excellent and the bedroom... Well, I booked the basic room, I dread to think what the suites will be like. Our room had a mezzanine floor and a swimming pool for a bath, with 3 TVs in the room. The hotel is small , and if there is a con to the pros it will be the cost. However, even though it is not cheap, it is value for money, and that for a 5* is not an easy thing to address. If you can afford to stay at 41 it is a must stay hotel in London.‚Ä¶"
September 2014,AMAZING!!,"Hotel 41 was fantastic.  The location was convenient to everything, as it is centrally located across the street from Buckingham Palace.  It is also only about 2 blocks from the Victoria tube/train station.  The hotel feels more like a special club!  Every single person that works there is professional, kind, and caring beyond belief.  They truly want you to be as comfortable as possible.  When we first checked in, they showed us to our junior suite, a split level room.  As I had just taken a bad fall, my legs were not happy with any extra stairs.  When I inquired about alternative rooms, they responded immediately by moving us to the Balmoral Suite- a huge hospitality suite- for no additional charge!!  We also appreciated the endless options for food and drink as we were always‚Ä¶"
July 2014,"Whatever, Whenever","Without a doubt, one of the finest hotels in the world. We have stayed in the best Mexico has to offer and all over Europe, and 41 has them all beat. From top to bottom the service was impeccable and intuitive. The property is tiny and intimate, and even though there are other guests it doesn't feel crowded; rather, it feels like home. The staff are well-educated and cheerful. Most have traveled the world and we found them to be a good resource for recommending other far-off places to stay.   The best part: the Whatever, Whenever button on each phone. Just pick up the receiver, hit the button and speak. There is seemingly nothing the staff cannot accommodate. Whatever you want, Whenever you want it - this is the guiding principal and it's utterly impressive to see it in‚Ä¶"
June 2014,Greatest Hotel and Staff in London,"My 14 year old grandson and I have been traveling to London for the past 3 years and we always stay at the 41 Hotel.  All of the staff in this Hotel are wonderful! Customer service is outstanding and the room decors are beautiful. We look forward to returning again in June 2015!  Sincerely,  Jeffrey Shaner Las Vegas, Nevada"
September 2014,Best boutique hotel in London,"My parents visited London recently and we all stayed here, I have to say it was one of the best hotels I've stayed in.  I'm not a jet setter, but I know quality service and performance when I see it.  Great staff, great location, wonderful food. 10 out of 10 for these guys."
September 2014,Impeccable Service,"The staff at this boutique hotel, just near Buckingham Palace, were among the best I have ever had serve me in any hotel, in the world. Nothing was too much trouble and their attention to detail was evident at every turn. If you want to be wowed, try this."
September 2014,Amazing experience,"My partner and I chose the 41 to celebrate a special anniversary and were very pleased with our selection.  The hotel and staff are fantastic. I have traveled extensively in the U.S. And internationally and the 41 is undoubtedly the best hotel I have stayed in.  The excellence of the hotel is due in large part to the staff.  I want to give special mention to the manager, Lauren, as well as Stefanie, Alina, Florent, Marius, Norbert, Paula, Marlen, Juliana, Simone, and Yohan, all of whom were extremely professional, courteous, and genuinely concerned about ensuring that the needs of all guests are met.  The hotel staff truly exemplify the motto ""no request is too large or small"".  In fact, they focus on guest comments and go above and beyond to create a memorable stay.  Not only‚Ä¶"
September 2014,Outstanding service,"We spent one week of our honeymoon with the family at hotel 41. I say family because you literally felt at home. The staff are extremely lovely, helpful and will help you with anything at any time. Such a central location and overlooking the Royal Mews which is awesome. Easy walking distance to the tube and local attractions. Good was superb and for me, the service was top notch. Thank you so very much for a brilliant and comfortable stay. "
August 2014,Our Crown Jewel,"Planning our first trip to London, we were given an extensive list of 5 star hotels. We chose none of them and instead decided to take a chance on TripAdvisor's #1 rated hotel. I think all who have had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 would give it 6 stars.  What a special place to spend our first time in London! From the moment we arrived and were greeted with delicious, flowing champagne, to the moment we left, when we hugged the staff goodbye - it was impeccable hospitality.  Attention to detail is amazing, ""plunder the pantry"" is exactly as it promises and more, and staff goes far beyond what could ever be imagined to make your stay special. This beautiful little gem is a magnificent jewel in the queen's crown and made our visit to London one we will never forget."
August 2014,It is definitely worth it's #1 ranking on Trip Advisor,"We just returned from our trip to the UK and Paris and selected Hotel41 based on the reviews on TripAdvisor.  The hotel exceeded our expectations in every way!  Hotel41 is a boutique hotel (28 rooms) and part of the Red Carnation Hotel chain (which we were not familiar with prior to our trip).  The hotel itself is adjacent (part of) Ruben's Hotel at the Palace.  A note to travelers - if you are traveling to the hotel via taxi, tell the driver to take you to Ruben's, none of the taxi drivers we used had heard of Hotel41 by name.  The service is impeccable, and you could not ask for a better location (across the street from Buckingham Palace) - close to Victoria Station for train and tube access.    We have traveled and stayed at many 5 star hotels, Hotel41 is definitely in our‚Ä¶"
March 2014,Amazing hotel,We stayed in this hotel while visiting central London. The hotel was amazing and the staff who was working at the time very friendly. Also its fair to add the rooms were very clean. Good value. Highly recommended.
August 2014,Amazing,"Everything about this hotel is fantastic. The deserts at night are delicious the ice cream fridge is great, definitely take advantage of their pantry.  The staff is so fabulous, always there but not intrusive and they don't stand around awkwardly waiting for a tip (I hate that). The bed is so soft and comfy, the shower and tubs are also fabulous, best shower head ever. Champagne on arrival with fresh berries waiting in our room and a pillow menu I case you need so something different."
August 2014,"Wonderful stay, lovely staff and very convenient location","We stayed at the Hotel 41 in the Balmoral suite for four nights in August 2014 with our three children and we cannot say enough kind words about the staff who were so gracious and accommodating to us - and especially to our children who are 8, 11 and 13. We travel quite a bit with our children and Hotel 41 was one of our favorites of all time. From giving us bus map apps, to helping us with tour tickets, to ""fixing"" our tv (our own tech deficiencies), to the fresh fruit in the room and delicious snacks in the Executive Suite - the staff was incredible.   We came to the 41 after spending a week in Ireland where we had quite large separate rooms or suites, so all of us were worried that we'd be on top of each other in one suite -- but that was NOT the case at 41! We were so happy‚Ä¶"
August 2014,Another world...,"I booked this hotel at the last minute as I wanted to be close to my first meeting.  After flying in on a late flight from NY I arrived around 11 pm but was greeted by a friendly staff, glass of champagne and buffet of appetizers in the lounge.  The lounge itself is very formal, old world and an experience by itself.  The room was not big but was well appointed and had everything I needed.  I liked the idea of the ""plunder the pantry"" concept but did not stay long enough to take advantage of it.  I was not crazy about the gym access at LA Fitness as the gym was not ideal but clearly better than nothing.  I also did not like all the construction going on close to the hotel but nothing they can do about this.  Overall I was impressed and will consider returning the next time I am‚Ä¶"
July 2014,Best Trip Ever,"We stayed at Hotel 41 in July 2014, after nearly 15 years from our last trip to London. It was amazing. From the effortless check-in, to having them print off my very own Washington Post, to relaxing breakfasts and pantry, our stay was perfect. Great location, top-notch and attentive staff, they made our week memorable. We will definitely stay here again!"
April 2014,No Regrets,"My wife and I stayed here, April of 2014....from the moment you arrive, you can tell this place is different and amazing. The check in was flawless, the rooms beautifully appointed, the parlor filled with complimentary wine/cheese/water/soda/ the reading area was amazing. The staff was very attentive and  always approachable. And the location, not sure if it could be more perfectly placed......Hotel 41 has our highest recommendation. "
April 2014,absolutely delightful experience and service!,"absolutely delightful experience and service! perfect location, service, and staff! I would love to come back to this small, cozy hotel!!  The hotel was very close to buckingham palace which is perfect for sightseers and travellers!"
August 2014,3 days in London - this is the place!,"My husband and I had the chance for a short trip to London without our kids. We had not been to London in nearly 20 years. We wanted to make the most of our three days and nights and the Hotel 41 was the perfect place to do so. The location near Buckingham palace was excellent. It was easy to walk to places such as Westminster Abbey and the London Eye from there, and there was a tube station close by. We also took a few taxis, which the hotel staff hailed for us. The Victoria Palace theater is just around the corner, where we saw the show Billy Elliott. Every morning we had a fantastic English breakfast, and we also had high tea as part of our package, which we thoroughly enjoyed. (It was a much more relaxed and gracious experience than the time we had tea at the Savoy back in‚Ä¶"
August 2014,Outstanding service & More...,"Well‚Ä¶ Whoever will read this review is lucky. Why lucky? because after you finish, you will definitely reserve this fabulous hotel.  This Boutique hotel  is definitely the best in London. I have stayed in more than 20 different hotels in London and can't compare hotel 41 to others.  Location: Absolutely best possible in London.  Quite area and yet close to most London sites. (Big Ben, London Eye, all the Parks, Piccadilly, Museum and of course Buckingham palace)  Room: Wonderful. Well equipped, clean and shine. The best room in London for 400-450 pounds rate.  Service: OK‚Ä¶ This is the best point here‚Ä¶ I was always dreamed to get in London Hotels the service I'm getting in Thailand. I always thought it's impossible‚Ä¶ Well‚Ä¶ I was wrong! The service in Hotel 41 is the best in any‚Ä¶"
August 2014,Beyond the excellent,"Everything is perfect - location, service, staff, food, etc. etc. We just spent four nights at this hotel and definitely would love to come back.  You are treated almost like a member of a royal family at this small hotel. It's very cozy, clean, comfortable and very quiet. Not crowded - just 28 rooms, or so. Short walking distance to all major attractions (not to mention the Royal Mews and Buckingham Palace literally across the street). When I saw it, being listed as #1 at TripAdvisor, I expected it to be good, but it was really exceptional!!"
July 2014,Boutique hotel in a great location,"I jumped a flight from Washington DC to London one evening, leaving behind my husband to tend to the teenagers and decided a two night stay prior to a stay in the English countryside with girlfriends was just what the doctor had ordered. Hotel 41 did not disappoint!  It is a small hotel, tucked away and mere steps from Buckingham Palace, The Royal Mews and Victoria Station. Customer service is paramount and the staff were very attentive to my needs, knowing that I was a female traveling alone - an English Rose escaping her American philandering husband. This is a boutique hotel with high accolades from both TripAdvisor and Conde Nast. Yes, the rooms are small, but every detail and amenity are at your fingertips. And if you are looking for peace and quiet, then the hotel will not‚Ä¶"
July 2014,Nice Hotel,"Such a nice place with nice staff too. Easy to find, great location and would recommend the hotel to anyone. The people who stayed here were friendly too which made it an overall excellent experience."
January 2014,Wonderful hotel,"Hotel 41 was a really amazing experience, and the staff were doing everything possible to make our stay comfortable.  Eg. upon arrival, during check in, we were offered a glass of champagne in front of the fireplace and in the late afternoon, canap√©s were offered to guests sitting in the central lounge.  The hotel is quite small and very cozy, and the lounge is very relaxing and invites you to sit and chat, read a book etc. while you can help yourself to drinks and small snacks from the bar."
July 2014,Without question the best!!,"I cannot state enough how good this hotel is. The decor is beautiful, the food is amazing but what makes it above any other place I've ever stayed (or probably ever will) at is the staff. They go over and beyond what is the expected level of service and make your stay so good you just don't want to leave. My wife and I spent our last night of our honeymoon here before flying out and we didn't want to venture out of the hotel. I booked the romantic package which is definitely worth it, especially for the perfect night with your partner. At many hotels there are offers of extra this or that and they are overpriced and not worth it. Not here. Virtually any extra we went for was not only fantastic but perfecto worth the money. We cannot thank all the staff enough for the most‚Ä¶"
May 2014,Simply amazing!,"We stayed here for two nights, for our wedding anniversary, and everything was absolutely perfect.    From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty; upon our arrival we were booked into our room with a glass of champagne. The staff were brilliant. Breakfast was wonderful. After arriving back from the theatre, we were greeted with candles and rose petals scattered around our room, music playing and a bottle of champagne.  We have already recommended this hotel to friends of ours. There was nothing about our stay I would change - a truly memorable experience.   Many thanks to all at Hotel 41"
August 2013,By Far Best Hotel we have ever experienced,"Hotel 41 exceeded our expectations from the moment the door opened to the Lobby. They knew who we were before we introduced ourselves. We traveled with our children ages 8,12,and 16 as well as my parents aged 65. The employees went above and beyond to make sure everyones experience there was unforgetable. All the small details were attended to. Unfortunately a main water line was broken down the street while we were there causing the water to be shut down and the hotel staff provided extra bottles of water and whatever else they could to make it bearable in the meantime. And I can honestly say even with that glich (which was beyond their control) we had the most amazing time. Also the location is absolutely fabulous. Walking distance to all the main attractions one would want to‚Ä¶"
July 2014,"First impressions, they still work...","From the moment I was greeted at the lobby with the offer to valet park my car to the moment I departed the hotel, everything and everyone at 41 was a credit to RC Hotels. Quirky, yes, the most luxurious, possibly not, but in terms of the welcome, staffing, comfort, and being made to feel like a privileged individual and not just a number, 41 didn't miss a beat.   Arriving at 8.30am, a complimentary breakfast and a room to change in was offered by Monika and Lauren at reception which got us off to a fabulous start. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff and each of them were extremely polite, very well trained, and were faultless in making our stay as comfortable as possible at all times. The rooms were very comfortable and well sized, whilst the Executive‚Ä¶"
July 2014,the swank without the snoot,"we are the goofy americans people talk about, and still the staff was so uniformly cheerful, polite and friendly that we felt accepted and welcomed. they were more than eager to assist even when i got food poisoning and was a mess. i dealt with probably 10 different employees, and they were all gracious. i will definitely be back :)"
July 2014,awesome sevices,"What a great hotel in such a perfect location, in the heart of the city very close to all the major shopping, nightlife and attractions. Hotel 41 is a hotel within a hotel, its the top floor of another hotel and a very stylish and comfortable space. Surprisingly large for downtoen london and a very solid staff. Loved the hotel and the area"
July 2014,Hotel 41 is way past fantastic!,"Hotel 41 is a super fantastic hotel with super excellent service!  And that's putting it lightly!  My husband is a die hard Ritz Carlton fan.  I was surprised when he suggested we stay at a Red Carnation Hotel, but, well, who am I to complain?  Hotel 41 exceeded our expectations and for some reason I felt privileged to stay there.  It's that good.  It's way past excellent!    We were able to compare room decor and size with a similar room at the Grosvenor Hotel where one of our friends was staying.  Our bed was the size of his entire room, no need to discuss the differences any further.    As for service, the attendants are way past exceptional.  For example, we traveled to London to see the Monty Python Stage Show.  Monica found all the reviews and printed them out for us as‚Ä¶"
July 2014,Everyone knows your name but little details need attention,It has been a number of years since my last visit. While the lobby lounge keeps getting better there were a couple of complaints from my recent stay.  Rooms-while well appointed the bathrooms were very small and the showers especially small for a large guest. I stayed in three different rooms and found that when a separate shower area was provided the space was tiny. The Hospitality Suite at 839 pounds was much too expensive while the other rooms at 395 were fairly priced. On two occasions I asked about renting a local cell phone. No one gave me an answer. There is a large staff but I never figured out the distribution of responsibility. Upon checkout they resolved  my misunderstanding about champagne in the lounge being free rather than 16 or 17 pounds per glass. They were‚Ä¶
March 2014,Hotel 41!!,"Hotel 41! What a great hotel in such a perfect location, right in the heart of the city. Its very close to all the major shopping, nightlife and attractions. Very stylish and comfortable space, surprisingly large for downtown london. Superb service and excellent environment. Highly recommended"
August 2013,Very Very Good Service,"My husband fell in love with this hotel. The location is wonderful. The staff are amazing, they even gave me a hot water bottle in the bed to warm it up! They changed rooms to one with a fireplace! Amazing. However, the staff was so attentive, I almost felt uncomfortable."
July 2014,Beat in the whole wide world!!,Hands down this is my favorite hotel in the world. It was the first time I stayed there and it was the last time. The hotel itself is quirky and cool while the staff is nothing short of awesome. My daughter and I were treated like royalty. I think the employees truly enjoy working here because they are so happy and helpful- no task too big for them. It's so very close to Buckingham Palace I thought of waving to the Queen!
July 2014,Superb,"Our second stay at Hotel 41 and pleased to say the standards are as high as ever. The staff make this hotel what it is and their professionalism and friendliness is amazing. One of our party was in a wheelchair and he was well catered for and looked after. Special thanks to stefan and lauren who were attentive, helpful and amusing. Keep up the great work- can't wait to stay again"
July 2014,Just a bowl of cherries,"Many five star hotels have sumptious surroundings, delicious food and drink and exceptional comfort,  Hotel 41 has all of these but also something else that sets it apart - absolutely amazing customer service which is friendly and professional but never snooty.   I stayed here for three nights with my 11 year old daughter in a Junior Suite as a treat for her winning a major golf competition.  We returned to our room on the first evening to find a 'congratulations' cake waiting for her, its fair to say she was delighted at this thoughtful touch.  One afternoon we returned to the hotel and my daughter proceeded to avail herself of the cherries dotted around the complimentary fruit bowl in the street level lobby. The concierge inquired if we would be going to the executive lounge‚Ä¶"
June 2014,"Location and service: ""Brilliant""","There is really not much that I can add to the other rave reviews.  Location: unbeatable ‚Äì right next to the Queen.   Staff: very professional and personable ‚Äì with a special mention to Monika and Stefan, who both went the extra mile to make our stay special.   Rooms: not particularly large, but well appointed, comfortable and cozy.  Breakfast: generous ‚Äì particularly enjoyed the eggs royal!   We went out each evening and sadly never managed to ‚Äúraid the pantry.‚Äù  Which leads to my only quibble: the entrance is locked and left unattended at 11:00PM ‚Äì perhaps a tad early (especially when the key card doesn‚Äôt work), but no big deal.  All in all, an exceptional hotel.  A bit pricey, but one gets what one pays for.  Will definitely return."
July 2014,Loved it!,"We celebrated my wife's birthday here - and I am so pleased with the choice.  A special hotel - boutique style. The rooms are very pleasant, not huge, but knockout when you're trying to impress the missus!  The service was attentive but not overbearing, friendly but respectful - really pleasant. Nothing was too much trouble.  The Executive lounge is done out like a gentlemen's club (well, not having been to one, how I imagine such a club to be). Snacks all day (no charges) and an honesty bar.  The welcome glass of champagne on arrival really got the day off to a super start. And, if it's a romantic weekend, the turndown service was perfect.   During the week there are also business guests apparently, so it is not just couples.  We will be back! Loved it."
May 2014,WOW,I had booked the Rubens for a 50th Birthday treat for my husband. On arrival we were greeted by the duty manager who upgraded us to Hotel 41. What a fantastic surprise. When entering this hotel you are made to feel so very special. Our room was perfect and a welcome Happy Birthday cake from the hotel. We also had afternoon tea which was just perfect. This hotel certainly has the Wow factor and we can honestly say we have never experienced such a high standard of service from any other hotel where  we have stayed in. The staff deserve a massive congratulation's for there excellent customer relations skills. I only hope One day I have the pleasure of returning.
July 2014,Amazing Experience,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel 41 in London England last weekend and were blown away by the service provided by this boutique hotel located close to Buckingham Palace in London.The staff went above and beyond the call of duty and the accommodations were outstanding. We would recommend this gem to anyone looking for a charming getaway in the heart of London. Steve and Ewa from Oakville, Canada"
July 2014,Second visit even better than the first,"My first visit blew me away and this second visit in a year improved on that. The staff manage to combine super-friendliness with great professionalism and customer service. They remembered us AND our TripAdvisor review!  Any room is great and make sure you leave room in your diet for the deli counter in the evening after the theatre - it includes salmon, desserts such as profiteroles, cheeses, cold meats, a mini hot dish etc.  I will always choose this hotel from now on!"
June 2014,JEWELBOX IN THE HEART OF THE CITY,"This was my first visit to HOTEL 41, but it will not be my last. This hotel is truly a little jewelbox in the heart of the City. With just 25 rooms, and as many staff, they offer a very high level of personal attention, and unlike some other high-end facilities, where the staff frequently seem overly-impressed with themselves, the staff at 41 seem to be interested only in giving you the very best experience possible. The room and bath were beautiful and comfortable, the food and wine was delicious (with a never-ending spread of treats in the Lounge, if you leave the facility hungry it certainly isn't their fault!), and the service, as mentioned above, was impeccable."
June 2014,Lived up to the hype,"We had the best family vacation possible thanks to the staff at Hotel 41.  Cannot believe that anyone would consider this less than 5*.  If you want a large reception area, workout room or spa then this is not the place for you.  If you want over the top service, great facilities and a fantastic location then this is a great choice, assuming that you are willing to pay for it (this hotel is not cheap). Many thanks to the hotel staff!  I hope that we can return someday!"
June 2014,Best hotel in the uk!,"Stayed at 41 for the night whilst visiting London and the theatre. The service was unobtrusive and simply amazing. Nothing was too much. Stefan particularly notable as a member of staff that makes you feel special, and at home at the same time. The extras in the lounge are second to none, and the wine cellar perfect. Our room had the comfiest bed and (seriously I'm not exaggerating) the BEST shower I've ever had! It was my birthday too and I was treated to candles, roses and chocolate dipped strawberries. If you only stay in one hotel this year-make it this one. "
June 2014,"Outstanding, private club feeling, just needs a garden","This is an outstanding hotel by every definition.    It's just a few blocks from the palace, but not really in the heart of where you might be going.    Tons of construction, lots of modern sort of building going on, surrounded by easily accessible parks too.   Marks and Spencer a block away for those food callings.  The conservatory suite is very nice, an entire glass roof over the bed, with push button blinds.   As in almost all London hotels, the light switches never make any sense at all.   The staff is beyond belief, instantly knowing you by name, serving you complimentary great food and snacks 24 hours a day, an honesty bar at night.     Unfortunately, there is no ""outside,"" but they are apparently designing a rooftop bar and garden, which will make this the perfect choice‚Ä¶"
June 2014,The best hotel I have stayed in.,"I took my wife down to London for our first wedding anniversary and found this lovely boutique hotel online amongst all the others. And my goodness I am so glad I chose ""41"". As it was our first anniversary, the hotel upgraded us to the master suite - what can I say about the room, stunning!! So comfortable, and well equipped. The staff are so friendly, make you feel right at home, nothing is too much of an issue. Had champagne afternoon tea, fantastic! Breakfast, eggs benedict on the recommendation of Stefan (who i must say is a wonderful host), really delicious. I could go on and on about how fantastic this hotel is, but I would just suggest you try it yourself!! Is there anywhere else I would stay in London for my next visit - NO. Looking forward to next time..."
May 2014,For my taste one of the best Hotels,"Hotel 41 is it - at least if you like personal treatment and british club atmosphere. The rooms are a little bit oldfashioned, however very well maintained and very quiet for a central London hotel. The Hotel is located near Victoria Sation and Buckingham Palace and is therefore an excellent starting point for business or leisure. What Hotel 41 is all about is service. From arrival through departure the extremely friendly and knowledgable staff reads your lips to make your stay a comfortable one. I can very much recommend this hotel."
June 2014,Excellent hotel in London!,"If you like a smaller hotel with personal service and an excellent location, this is the place!  After a long day of travel we were greeted with champagne (which we had to refuse because we were too tired!) and friendly faces.  After a review of the city map and many attractions that we might be interested in we given a tour and then shown to our room.  The rooms are small but the comfort is high!  I have to say that Remus went above and beyond to insure our stay was enjoyable!  We will be back!!"
June 2014,One of the best boutique hotels in London,"I met an exceptionally great group of staff members working for Hotel 41. My stay at the hotel was great and the hotel exceeded all my expectations. I have been to this hotel twice and always feel like home.  The staff was very very helpful at every moment and request. I love the concept of ""Whatever Whenever"". Just having one button makes a lot more sense and makes the guests life a whole lot easier.  I plan to stay here again in future whenever I travel to London. I don't think there is one single staff member that I would like to highlight - I think all of them provided me with an exemplary service and I would like to thank and highlight all of them.  Thanks Hotel 41 for such great experience :)"
July 2013,My favorite hotel,"We stayed at the hotel 41 three years ago and we still talk about it as our favorite hotel.  The service, the comfort, the late night snacks and honor bar, the breakfasts, it was all just perfect.  So comfortable - expensive yes, but completely unpretentious. A great family hotel.  If I find myself back in London, I wouldn't hesitate to spend some time at the 41."
June 2014,Special Hotel,"We picked hotel 41 because of the reviews and high scores on trip advisor, so I arrived with high expectations, but was a little wary, as we were getting married in London on the day of our stay But from the moment we checked in, our party of 8 all had our rooms upgraded, to our departure, we were treated like kings. The service is second to none and the hotel is luxury, My expectations were met and so much more, best hotel I have stayed in. I hope to return for future anniversaries, well done hotel 41."
May 2014,Wow as Usual - A London Secret,"I stay at this hotel several times a year when I travel to London for business. The location is very central with easy to access the Underground. The secret of this hotel is the service, I have no idea what the staff to guest ratio is, but there is always someone to help you available at any time of the day. I regularly have business meetings in their boardroom, and they have assisted me getting tickets to plays and London events while I am in town with excellent attention to detail. I like to think of Hotel 41 as my home in London."
May 2014,A wonderful stay in a beautiful hotel,"This was the best and most relaxing stay in London we have ever had, largely due to the nature of the hotel and the staff and management who work there.  The service started before our visit with the manager asking for our personal preferences so that they could be accommodated for our arrival.  We received a complimentary room upgrade overlooking the Royal Mews, with complimentary champagne and personal message from the manager marking our special occasion.  Hotel 41 is a small but beautifully appointed hotel with top quality furnishings and room accessories. Although rooms are not huge the focus is very much on quality and service, rather than size. The theme of quality runs throughout the hotel.  The staff were exemplary and very attentive; some may have seen this as‚Ä¶"
October 2013,Another excellent stay,"Stayed in this hotel with the family, and it really was an excellent stay. The location is excellent, the staff are great, and I liked the decor. They also do a lot of small things that do make you stay that little bit more special."
March 2014,Luxury and Attention,"I have been fortunate enough to have stayed at Hotel 41 a number of times and the service, ambiance and every bit about this Hotel stays constant. It is superb, from the moment you arrive at the reception desk through to the very personal service received from every member of staff throughout your stay. All the staff want you to have a great experience, you can just tell and you do. I love to book in around lunchtime and just sit in the wonderful library surrounding until early evening, nibbling and drinking their brilliant wine, I just don't want to go anywhere, sad but true. I cannot recommend this Hotel more highly, it is just luxury. Additionally you are a few hundred yards walk from Buckingham Palace and the beautiful St. James Park as well as 20 minutes walk to Park Lane‚Ä¶"
May 2014,Never fails to be the best!,"This was our 4th time staying at 41 and at the risk of sounding like a broken record, it was excellent again! Monika and the team looked after us like old friends.  41 is relaxing, peaceful, friendly and quite simply the best place we've found to stay in London.  Hoping to be back again for Christmas!"
May 2014,"The ""E"" in Excellent","My wife and I recently stayed in Hotel 41. The experience was overwhelming.  The staff was professional, attentive, and exacting. Most times when I mentioned an issue or desire in passing it was acted upon immediately. This is a one-of-a-kind gem of a hotel. I would have loved to stay longer, unfortunately, we had to leave. The location is perfect and obscure.  But don't worry. Most taxi drivers in London know its location. Strongly recommend you stay there, even for a short stay, and be prepared to be treated like royalty.  The stay was unforgettable and it is our location of choice on a future visit to London!"
May 2014,Fantastic !,"I would just like to reiterate what others have said.  I booked this hotel following all the great reviews as a 60th birthday surprise for my mum and I was not disappointed.    After a very early morning flight, my mum and I were greeted very warmly with a glass of Champagne and were told we had been upgraded!  We sat in the Executive lounge, taking in all the beautiful surroundings whilst we waited for Eggs Benedict (which I would strongly recommend)!  You were made to feel very relaxed and encouraged to soak up the atmosphere.   There was food in abundance.  You will never go hungry and Stefan was always on had with a glass of Champagne!    The hotel is ideally situated for Victoria station and Harrods is only a 20 minute walk away. The hotel staff are very knowledgeable, are‚Ä¶"
April 2014,Fabulous !,"You know you have entered a quality hotel, no sooner are you through the door and the friendly staff have taken your bags and offered you a glass of champaign or fine wine.  There is only 2 floors to this hotel the entrance and the 5th floor here all the rooms are situated and the dining room stroke bar area, they work on a honesty bar with all named drinks and if you can't find what your looking for the helpful staff will soon find it or mix it up  We only had breakfast here but that was really well made we have already said we will be staying here again in no time At all"
May 2014,"Lovely Location, Lovely Staff","No review can adequately convey how fabulous this hotel is.  The service is the best.  They have a whatever, whenever button on phone and that sums it up.  Every request we had, they fulfilled.  They can fast track tickets for most anything.  The lounge is very nice with breakfast in a.m. Then snacks all day into evening included.  A honor bar is available ( glass of very good champagne is offered upon arrival complimentary).  We had an executive king room that was a nice size and very comfortable bed.  All of the staff are so friendly and helpful!!  Good location and great wi-fi.  We will return."
May 2014,Wonderful service!,"The first thing you notice when you enter this cosy English hotel is the courteous and well mannered staff. Everyone laughs and smiles, and just make you happy! They ask if they can help at every point.   Apart from the staff, the great thing about this hotel is their little knick knacks that are laid out throughout the day, to help fill in the little gaps in your stomach. I always looked forward to see what was in store after spending a good day in London.  Their rooms are quite English to begin with. Quite cosy. Their beds are like feathers. I almost always slept within minutes once I was on them.   Overall a lovely stay!"
May 2014,AMAZING!!!,"On arrival to this gem of a hotel, we were upgraded to their beautiful executive suite, we were given a glass of Champagne and shown all the facilities. We were shown to our room and instantly fell in love with it.  The staff were so helpful, they really couldn't do enough for us. We would go back without hesitation and would recommend this wonderful hotel to anyone."
May 2014,A truly unique and fabulous experience! ,"I have to say that this hotel has the extras you don't usually get in a 5 star hotel.  First the staff was almost like a very polite and hospital family,  you felt directly at home and treated us like one of their own. Second, the service!!!! Outstanding thought to details and creating an atmosphere where you as guest could feel total relaxation.  Third, the lounge was so delicate and superbly designed that you felt time was slowing down and a feeling of total calmness was surging thru you like a warm bries on a nice summer night.  "
May 2014,"Lovely, luxurious boutique hotel","This hotel is small and very intimate.  The location is perfect, close to everything but quiet as well.  The service is amazing!  The lounge is a very nice feature - we went almost every night before dinner for a relaxing drink and complimentary snacks.  The rooms are a very nice size and the bathroom was lovely too.  We would absolutely return!"
May 2014,Our 25th Wedding Anniversary,"Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne.  Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room.  Inside a congratulations cake & sweets.  We had canap√©s & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music.  I was very emotional.  Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41.  Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere.  We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave.  Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again.  Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well.  Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful."
August 2014,A 2nd visit within last 3 months,"We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August.  We love this hotel.  The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren.  All of the staff was so friendly and helpful.  All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations.  We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good!  Great canap√©s at cocktail time in the lounge.  The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city.  Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41."
August 2014,Outstanding boutique hotel,"This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one.‚Ä¶"
August 2014,The BEST of many fabulous hotels in London!,"This is only the second time I have felt moved to write a hotel review--this place is THAT special. I have stayed at other excellent luxury hotels in London before but decided on Hotel 41 this time and I was absolutely thrilled!  I was in town alone visiting friends for a few days and the extraordinary staff made me feel completely at home.  I really cannot say enough about them.  Every single person went out of their way to be welcoming and helpful.  I found myself catching up on work each night in the ""lobby"" which is actually more like a library or drawing room in a private home with comfortable chairs and sofas with tables set and food and drink available 'round the clock.  My room was comfortable and impeccably clean.  I can't wait to go back and I am recommending the 41 to‚Ä¶"
May 2014,It's so nice returning to this hotel,"I would like to thank the staff at hotel 41 for making my stay such a pleasant and enjoyable one. I was in London two years ago and visited this hotel for the first time. The staff were so friendly and professional that I decided to return to the hotel again when I was recently in London.  The staff have lost none of their charm and dedication towards the guest. They really are the best staff of any hotel that I have stayed at in the world (and I do not say this lightly).  I would like to thank in particular Monica, Simone, Stefan and David. Nothing is too much trouble for these people and they made my stay another memorable one.  I will happily recommend this hotel to any one who wants not only a stay but an experience in London too. I look forward to returning to the hotel in‚Ä¶"
May 2014,Another Crown Jewel of London,"If you are looking for a small, luxury, boutique hotel, look no further.  While the location, rooms, amenities and food are all outstanding, it is the service that puts the hotel in a class by itself.  This is by far the best service that I ever have been accorded in any European or Asian hotel I have stayed in.  Lauren and Monika and their entire hotel staff were wonderful in assisting with theatre tickets, hard to get dinner reservations and shopping suggestions.   On this trip (April 30-May 4) I was traveling with a friend, but I can't wait to pay a return visit to the hotel with my husband!  Jacqueline P."
May 2014,What a gem!,"We spent 2 days at Hotel 41 after a 15 day transatlantic repositioning cruise on a small cruise ship.  We had been terribly spoiled by the service on the ship, and we were unsure of what Hotel 41 would be like.  The service in the hotel was unbelievably fabulous.  We were pampered from the moment we arrived right through our departure.  The staff was attentive, friendly and very, very professional.  Anything and everything we asked for was seen to with a smile.  The hotel's location is but a few steps from Buckingham Palace and is just a short walk to Westminster Abbey and Parliament.  Other London attractions, if not within walking distance, are easily accessed by nearby public transit.  Our very comfortable room, like the rest of the hotel, was immaculate.  Staying at Hotel 41‚Ä¶"
May 2014,"Truly 5 Star, excellent service","We were warmly greeted by Victoria on our arrival. Lauren gave us the orientation ""tour"". All the rooms are on one floor, as well as the executive lounge where we were seated and offered breakfast while being checked in.  Due to our transatlantic flight we arrived very early but they still allowed us to check in and provided us with a room about 30 min later.  The room may be on the smaller side by American standards but is adequate and well appointed. They put in those extra touches that I love like a bathroom scale! Full length mirror, dimmable lights and reading lights, Penhaligon toiletries  The executive lounge is most likely where u will have breakfast or a late night snack and utilize the concierge to make plans for the day. The room has a great domed skylight which is‚Ä¶"
April 2014,Perfect Honeymoon!,"From the moment we arrived to the moment we left everything was perfect. We were a week in London on our honeymoon and all the staff in 41 went out of their way to make it a very special occasion for us. We were treated to drinks and canapes on arrival. We had cake, fruit and water in our room. What surprised us the most though was the attention to detail. The staff noted what we wanted to do for the week and then helped us at every opportunity to make it better.   Our room was beautiful and so comfortable. The bed in particular was so comfy. The room and bathroom were spotless. The food in the hotel was delicious. Raiding the pantry is a must! It was so useful on our return from the theater on one of the nights. The food on offer is varied and always fresh. We were spoiled for‚Ä¶"
May 2014,Great atmosphere ! Spotlessly clean Hotel!,Amazing Staff !! the room was spotlessly clean!!! We had a wonderful stay !!  Location was amazing  next to all the theatres and Victoria station we will be back ! Forgot to say the beds were really comfortable and the design of the rooms we liked very much
August 2014,5 Star Service!,"We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations.   There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing!  If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place‚Ä¶"
August 2014,Wonderful oasis!!,"My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit."
August 2014,One of the best in London,"I am not easily impressed, however; on this occasion I was. Would like to say that it is an absolutely amazing cave to escape and relax and to enjoy pure luxury.  The best thing about this establishment is their personnel. True professionals in every sense. Fabulous!! Nothing is too much trouble and with a huge smile on their faces.  Most amazing bed in my suite. Like a huge fluffy cloud. Slept like a baby!  Attention to detail is added to absolutely everything.  Truly impressed and will be returning soon.  Great location for exploring if you are visiting London for pleasure rather than business."
August 2014,Fantastic service,From the moment we arrived the service was impeccably efficient and friendly too. The check in was seamless and the choice of arrival drink a lovely touch. The room was very well appointed and decorated with lots of toiletries and towels. There service was very personal and the staff all remembered our names and asked about our theatre trip on our return to the hotel. We loved the plunder the pantry in the evening with the selection of tasty treats. This was in the executive lounge which was a great place to relax any time of day. The breakfast had a great selection of quality items including excellent cooked choices. We have visited four different Red Carnation Hotels. They are all very good. This is the best. 
August 2014,The Perfect Proposal,"What an amazing experience! For months I have looked at different ways to propose in or around London but failed to find something special. I am glad I chose Hotel 41!  Weeks in advance I was given the opportunity to discuss every single detail with the Hotel team. It was planned so perfectly that when I checked-in I thought they had forgotten about what was supposed to happen.  A Proposal in the rooftop of the hotel with a champagne tasting experience and canapes. The actual proposal was made using telescope pointing at an adjacent building with a message: ""Will you marry me?"". Over the course of the evening we had the opportunity to then see the stars and the moon - Pretty romantic and unique! The following day we went for a picnic in St. Jame's Park, which is just a few‚Ä¶"
August 2014,Lovely small boutique hotel with the perfect location.,"This 28 room hotel does feel like a private club instead of a hotel. If you like very small hotels  then this is the place for you. As you walk into the front door off the street, you are directed up to an elevator to the executive lounge which is the check out/in area/ breakfast area, etc. A beautiful room for sure. We stayed for one night only as a layover and were in the Monarch Suite, a small 2 room area, and my husband and I both had separate bathrooms and a door bt/ the bedroom and living room. It was perfect for us, I cannot image anymore than 2 people staying in any of their rooms or suites. The location is great. Overall we really liked this hotel, not loved it. My husband summed it up perfectly, and but would go back again, but it was a little claustrophobic for him. ‚Ä¶"
August 2014,One of the Best in the World,"There are only two places in the world we have stayed that came close to the service we experienced at Hotel 41. Lauren, Victoria and Steffan (amongst several others I cannot recall) were simply amazing and went WAY above and beyond what we hoped for. Their constant refreshing of snacks and food in the main area (not sure if that is what they call it) was also awesome, they took really, really good care of us and I also appreciate a place that uses brilliant branding. You will find the 41 logo on almost everything in your room which, as a marketer, I thought was cool. We highly recommend this place and it is easy walking distance to Buckingham palace."
April 2014,Best hotel in London,"Stayed here for one night whilst we went to the theatre. I was so impressed with the staff and the little extras that this will now be our default hotel for London. The staff were far and away the most genuinely friendly and helpful staff we have experienced in the UK.  Some of the little but special touches were: - staff remembering your itinerary so always one step ahead, including flagging a taxi down as soon as I emerged from the lift - always offering something extra, such as an umbrella and bottle of water on the way out or professionally wrapping the flowers I had bought for my wife so I could carry them on the train - arranging spots in the hotel for me to have business meetings and caring as much for my guests as they did for me - the free snacks, canap√©s and late night‚Ä¶"
April 2014,Incredible hotel and the best hotel I have stayed at in London,"This is quite simply a totally amazing experience. The staff are superb and nothing is too much trouble. They all remember your name and are incredibly helpful. The room was beautifully decorated and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. The lounge area is beautiful and relaxing and you get given canap√©s and snacks with your drinks. There is an honesty bar and the ""pantry"" food is very good. I can't wait to go back again. The location is super and it is such a treat to find a hotel like this in a big city. Loved it!"
March 2014,very good,"I was stay at Hotel 41 for 2 nights. I was really impressed with their service. My room was also very nice, clean and large. The staffs were helpful too. I really like this hotel and would like to come back here again."
March 2014,Wonderful,"We only stayed one night but now looking forward to a return visit. We received a warm welcome, friendly efficient service, nothing was too much trouble. Pleasant room and very comfortable bed. Loved the idea of 'raiding the pantry' post theatre. Home from home feel in the lounge. Food excellent. Good central location."
March 2014,Feels like you are in a movie!,"I love this hotel. Its ambiance makes you feel like you are back in Twin Peaks times...! The lift has only one floor to chose...5th floor. Would be nice to call it 4 1/2 or something. Black and white decor, very friendly people, excellent kitchen and breakfast and very good location. What else can you ask for? Only small downside is, I called a week later to inquire if they found something I lost but they never got back to me..."
March 2014,A perfect London Hotel!,"My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41 for 9 nights while in London.  We were impressed well beyond our expectations.  The hotel was very clean and quiet and well located, very close to Victoria Station.  The staff were exceptional - always friendly and extremely professional. They even arranged for rose petals to be strewn in our room when they learned it was my birthday.  We have stayed in many hotels in North America, Europe, Hawaii and Asia and this hotel is by far the very best we have come across.  You won't regret booking here!"
March 2014,My new favourite London Hotel,"What can I say! Just book it!!  This is one the best hotels I have ever stayed in for service. they  say nothing is too much trouble and it really is. Our arrival was delayed 24hrs by a flight issue but Hotel 41 were great and had our transfer rearranged. Lovely car waiting for us on arrival and easy check in despite is being 6.30am. They felt bad for our delay so added a complimentary breakfast to our stay. We had a lovely champagne afternoon tea, the happy hour drinks and nibbles are amazing and the plunder the pantry is incredible. The selection of drinks/nibbles always on offer is a real benefit. Our room was an executive king room and was really lovely with everything you could need at your finger tips.  Can not recommend this hotel enough. It's not cheap but with all the‚Ä¶"
March 2014,Fantastic,"Loved that this hotel is not boringly ""corporate"". From the friendly, helpful front desk on, it feels different and special, like a private club. Staff all very friendly and professional.  The lounge is bright, airy and comfortable.  The room was large with excellent bathroom with bath plus separate shower. Plenty of wardrobe and storage space and loved all the extra touches, especially the candles burning in the bathroom when we came back, chocs, olives etc etc.  Comfy robes (but would have liked the slippers immediately - they arrived with the ""turn down"").  Good curtains/blinds kept the light out (but I think a little maintenance is needed to the blind). Quiet.  Spotlessly clean.  Provided everything you could possibly want and more (including the essentials for a spot of‚Ä¶"
March 2014,Fantastic stay,"one of the best hotels I have stayed in the world, Service from second arriving is like you are Royalty in fact thought I had booked into Buckingham palace next door by mistake.  Bedrooms are fresh and well appointed and the food at both locations was superb"
March 2014,A very special place! Note the taxis tip!,"Hotel 41 is about as special as it gets.   Firstly a tip.....most London cabbies will not have heard of it! This is not a negative, it's indicative of the exclusive nature of the place. Because of its small size and it's reputation only a lucky few get to stay there!  The Hotel Rubens is right next door and the cabbie will know that one!  Enough has been said about the quality of the place in other reviews which I fully concur with however what sets a hotel apart is the response when something goes wrong. In my case an afternoon tea where the finger sandwiches were dry. A quiet word saw the whole effort removed, an apology after 10 minutes because the manager was still not happy when she checked the replacement which was duly sent back with (I suspect blunt words to the chef to‚Ä¶"
March 2014,A perfect romantic weekend!,"I stayed at this hotel for one night with my girlfriend, in a junior suite with the romantic package. After a show and dinner we returned to find the suite covered with roses, the bath full and chocolates on the bed! It was perfect. The room was great, very clean, and the room service food was excellent. The staff were great and overall it was a fantastic experience. I recommend this hotel."
March 2014,London lodging at its best,"We were guests at 41 for 6 days in March and our experience was unmatched by any other hotel we've stayed at.  From the time we were greeted at the door, we felt as though the hotel was there only for us.  The attention of the staff went beyond professional.  All were friendly and accommodating in the very best tradition of 5 star hotels.  The attention of the staff -- from the general manager, Malcolm Hendry to the resident managers Lauren and Monika to the wait staff -- made us feel valued and respected on all counts.  Requests for dining suggestions, tour routes, directions to destinations, reservations and travel schedules were all answered promptly and efficiently.  If you can stay in only one place in London, ask the taxi driver to take you to 41.  He may not know where it‚Ä¶"
January 2014,Extremely Disappointed,"Re: Hotel 41, 41 Buckingham Palace Road, London SW1WOPS. My wife and I stayed in ‚ÄúHotel 41‚Äù for three nights in January 2014 I purposely booked Trip Advisor‚Äôs No.1 Luxury 5 Star Hotel in London. We had previously stayed in the No. 4 rated hotel, the Corinthia, which was excellent but as this was a special occasion I thought I would go better and go to the best ‚Äì how disappointing.  In no way does this hotel live up to the standard of a 5 star hotel. My wife described it as a luxury   B &B and we are dumbfounded as to how it achieved its rating from Trip Advisor as being the No. 1, 5 star luxury hotel in London. Here are our comments:- If this is the best 5 star Luxury Hotel in London it must cast a shadow on all other 5 star hotels in the city. Our experience of the 41 would‚Ä¶"
March 2014,Simply the best 5 star hotel we have ever stayed at!,"Let me start by saying we normally stay in 5 star hotels. We have stayed at the Ritz, Mandarin and many other high end 5 star hotels around the world.  This was without a doubt the best.  The hotel itself only has 29 rooms/suites. There is a lovely reading room you walk into, this is the place you dine and sit while you wait for your room.  Upon checking in we where presented with four different choices of champagne. Not just the cheap stuff either. We had a choice from 4 great brands. We both opted for the Veuve clique (one of our favourites). Two large glasses of free champagne later we were lead to our room.  The room itself was lovely large, spacious. Great views.  The room itself had sky TV in, this is a first for any hotel we have stayed in.  The shower was nothing short‚Ä¶"
March 2014,Unbelievable,"Certainly the best choice in London. Excellent location, near some of the most attractive points. The best of all is a higher level of service from the hotel management and staff. I had the great pleasure of staying at the Hotel 41 and would recommend it to anyone without reservation."
March 2014,Bob on.,"Perfect and very comfortable exclusive hotel. Loads of freebies, one needn't venture out really. Will stay longer next time. No grumbles what so ever. Highly recommended.  Some rooms are better than others.   "
March 2014,What a great experience!,"What a top notch hotel. I am not even done with our stay and am compelled to write a review based on the level of service from the hotel management and staff.    When we arrived we were greeted and given champagne. After all the paperwork we were shown around the hotel and went to our room. When we arrived there were a few issues with the room (TV didn't work properly, shower handle broke, and the toilette made a lot of noise). We brought it to managements attention and they took care of it the next morning while we were out.  Once we got back everything was fixed. In addition, we were given an upgraded room with complimentary champagne. Based on our current experiences I would give six out of five stars."
February 2014,"Your Own Exclusive, Private Club in the Heart of London","I had the great pleasure of staying at the Hotel 41 for a short 3 day holiday with my husband to celebrate my 35th birthday.  I have stayed at some beautiful hotels around the world, including in London, but there was something special about Hotel 41.  The hotel is very small - just one floor - but it feels very exclusive and private feel.  The main lounge/library is absolutely gorgeous, and is the center of activity at the hotel -- it's where you check in, have breakfast, and can lounge around with a drink or cup of tea after a day of sightseeing.  It has a  lovely fireplace, and my only complaint about my visit was that every time I went to the lounge, the spots next to the fireplace were always taken!  It's the kind of space you don't want to leave.    The rooms are‚Ä¶"
March 2014,Best Kept Secret in London,Recently spent 4 nights in London at Hotel 41.  This is the best kept secret in London.  It is a great location within walking distance of many attractions.    The service from the moment we walked in the door was nothing short of superb.  The amenities and service of a 5 star hotel with the cozy feel and intimacy of a B&B is the best way I can describe the experience.  We will definitely stay here on our next visit to London.  
July 2013,Marvelous!,"One of the top notel to stay in London. Great service to help you for all problems. Rooms are large and very clean, bathrooms wonderfull. We strongly suggest if you want to have a perfect stay in London!"
November 2013,Not really impressed,"Stayed at this hotel last November and was somewhat disappointed to be honest.I keep on reading rave reviews about this place but I've actually stayed in better B & B's around the country. It's very expensive for what's on offer and I probably would return if the price was reduced by 50%. There are alot of expensive gadgets in the bedroom that are probably seldom used ( e.g. TV in long narrow bathroom that is almost impossible to view - then why would you want to of course ? Not really for me I'm afraid to say. There are far better places to stay in London for the price ( like 5* hotels ) Apologies , but too many reasons against recommending this hotel as being one of the best in London."
March 2014,Fantastic romantic hotel,"Hotel 41 is a fantastic little hotel, in the heart of London. The service is super, the rooms are nicen and the whole place is like living in an old english mansion. We loved it and will come back some other time."
February 2014,Another great visit,Hotel 41 never let's me down. Staff amazing - food awesome  rooms so comfortable great bathroom -had a two story room with fireplace and sitting area. Very quiet  see you next year :) location location location
January 2014,Magical,"Our first time to London and so much to see and do.  An amazing city!  That said, the Hotel 41 was a big highlight of our trip and we would fly from Canada again just to spend time at this Hotel.  The management and staff are truly special in how they made us feel very comfortable and catered to our every desire making us feel like royalty.  A special thanks to Monika.  From the second you walk into this hotel it is very unique and warm feeling.  Our room was spacious, very functional, and romantic.  The beautifully designed lounge was quaint, and we always looked forward to spending time there at the end of a long day of sightseeing to relax and enjoy great food by the fireplace or in a cozy corner playing chess.  The staff really go out of their way to cater to your every need‚Ä¶"
February 2014,A wonderful place to remember!,"I booked the executive king room for my boyfriends 25th birthday and from start to finish the service and atmosphere was old school class. I couldn't fault anything about this hotel and truly feel like I have found a treasure in London. Brilliant for romance, quality time with your other half and full of pleasant surprises. Great location and scrumptious selection of food, drink and breakfast in the morning. I couldn't suggest booking Hotel 41 enough if only for one night it is really worth every penny! The staff make this hotel and it was a breath of fresh air to feel so well looked after.  "
January 2014,We loved the hotel and its staff.,"This hotel has excellent location. The services were very pleasant. room was very clean, nice decorated and quit too. The restaurant serve good foods, Just wonderful.For sure I would stay here. Definitely worthed for the money..."
February 2014,Fabulous hotel,As an extra treat for my husbands birthday I booked into hotel 41 for two nights. The whole stay was wonderful primarily due to the care and attention the staff and management discreetly provide. Many a large hotel could take a leaf out of the lengths of service this little gem of a hotel provides its guests. There are an abundance of excellent little touches like raid the pantry and champagne on arrival that also add to the experience. It is also worth highlighting that if you are looking for a romantic couple of days in the capital then the hotel goes a long way to make it memorable!
February 2014,Amazing,"Stayed here for my 21st birthday as a surprise from my boyfriend. I've never been anywhere and been treated so nicely. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff there. I was given roses and chocolates and surprised with a 'romantic turndown' in the room which was amazing. We were given a room upgrade as it was a special occasion, and the hotel arranged our entire evening when we went to see Billy Elliot. They booked our tickets which were right at the front in the middle and got me a signed programme which they left on the dinner table which was also covered in rose petals.  The pantry where you can eat complimentary food throughout the day is also delicious! came back after Billy Elliot and we had bread and salamis and cheeses and haagen daaz! It was an amazing and‚Ä¶"
February 2014,Delightful,I have stayed in a lot if hotels in my lifetime and this one definitely stands out. Genuine attention to detail with a smile  is not something that is easy to instil in the staff.. That is because they must really enjoy what they do.. And this wonderful boutique has pulled it off in virtually every category. From choice and quality of champagnes to supplying plasters (band aids). Your attention and friendliness right from the entrance to departure sets you a class above the rest.. And the Eggs Royale were definitely the best I gave tasted!  Congrats to all staff! 
February 2014,Fantastic,"Wow!!! What a beautiful boutique hotel this is. Fantastic staff who are never overbearing, but always on hand to help if needed. The rooms were large enough and well decorated.  The complimentary food and nibbles means you never go hungry for long. The location is also great for visiting Buckingham Palace which is a stones throw away. Maybe not the cheapest hotel available but you get what you pay for - first class service and any needs catered for. Thanks again to all the staff for making this a truly memorable Valentines stay."
December 2013,41 Hotel is 5*,"Fantastic stay, from the pillow menu to plunder the pantry. Stayed for a romantic weekend and therd could not have been a better place for it. All perfect. Clean, luxurious, helpful and exclusive. A truly wonderful getaway."
December 2013,incredible!,This hotel was hands down the best place we have ever stayed. The service was of the highest quality with no details forgotten. The small things made this place and I can only praise our stay here. We will definitely be returning! You will not be dissapointed in any sense!
December 2013,Justified #1; sets the standard for boutique hotel luxury,"To celebrate a special occasion, I wanted to select somewhere around Christmas time that would provide a special experience. After much researching and looking at names synonymous with London Luxury from The Ritz to Claridges etc., I settled on Hotel 41.  The communication from the outstanding manager, Mr Hendry, was excellent from the beginning of the booking process. It set a standard and tone of service that was evident in all staff that we had the pleasure of coming in to contact with. From the warm greeting after arriving early in the morning after a long haul flight, to the attention to detail in our room, I could not fault this establishment.  The guest lounge/dining area is an exceptional room, with old world decor that has a sophisticated and contemporary‚Ä¶"
December 2013,Wonderful hotel with excellent service and amazing staff,"Stayed at Hotel 21 for a family break between Christmas and New Year.  This was our first stay, but will definitely not be our last.  Cannot wait to return.  The warm and welcoming staff are incredible.  The atmosphere is calm and tranquil and envelops you as soon as you enter the wonderful lounge. The standard of service is second to none."
December 2013,A wonderful welcome home,"Having spent a wonderful pre Christmas 2012 at Hotel 41 we were delighted to return for the whole of Christmas 2013, enjoying a 3 night stay. And what a wonderful Welcome Home we were given. Hotel 41 is a truly magical place to stay and from beginning to end there is only perfection. We were given the same room as previously and this made us feel even more at home. There are  so many super reviews of Hotel 41 and they are all so true.  There are no superlatives that can really describe a stay at Hotel 41.  It's just something you have to experience for yourself.  And once you have?  Well then you will see just what its all about.  Its all about never wanting to stay anywhere else in London and its about the constant search for somewhere in the World that could possibly meet your‚Ä¶"
December 2013,Home away from home in London,Fantastic staff cosy lounge area with sideboard loaded with various snacks all day stylish room with instant hot water. Our new place to stay in london 20 min walk to theatres and Trafalgar Square Hyde park 10 min away
March 2013,Perfect Christmas in London,"My fianc√© and I stayed at Hotel 41 over Christmas (2013) on a five day vacation to London from the States.  It was perfect.  Our enjoyment of London on our trip was due largely to the comfort and excellent service of Hotel 41.  The hotel itself looks and feels like an exclusive private club.  Like you would expect at a private club the staff is first class and is on hand 24 hours a day to help with anything you want.  The hotel, other than the ground floor entrance, is on a single floor with about 20 rooms and a large, extremely comfortable ""clubroom.""  The clubroom has both food and bar service, an inviting fireplace, walls of bookshelves, and in general feels like (and is) the place you want start and end your day. We enjoyed breakfast, pre-dinner drinks, and late night snacks‚Ä¶"
December 2013,Best of London,"We are suprised,we see very good review on the Internet but we dont expect much.When we came into the hotel we are suprised to see old London decor in modern style.The staff is beautiful.Every moment in the hotel we fell like first class.Breakfast in the lounge was fantastic.All in all this the best hotel in London in my opinion."
December 2013,Great Gem In A Busy City,We decided to try a new neighborhood in London from previous visits and chose to stay at this boutique hotel.  What a treat.  We arrived tired and the staff greeted it us with such warmth and concern. We were offered a complimentary room to rest in before our room was ready.  We enjoyed a great breakfast in their warm living room with a great glass of champagne. Our room had a very comfortable bed with warm decor.  It is a very inviting little hotel and I know my sister and me would love to stay there again.
August 2013,Perfection once again,A pre-Xmas visit to London has become an annual pilgramage for us and No 41 is a key part of the experience.  From the first moment you step across the threshold to the moment you leave the staff treat you care and respect and look after your every need.  The welcome champagne which is free flowing coupled wth the lovely food bar is a wonderful touch.  The rooms are comfortable and perfectly maintained and very quiet (we had a great nights sleep).  What makes 41 stand out though is the extra care they take in listening to you and making sure you get what you want (for me it was a bag of Twiglets).  We love it and will always return.  Merry Xmas.
December 2013,Great Stay!,"My husband and I stopped over in London for one night before boarding a cruise ship to The United States.  Hotel 41 is a great place to stay!  The hotel is quiet, quaint and the staff is there to help with anything 24/7.  From the second we walked in the door, to the moment we caught our cab to the train station, everything was perfect.  When we arrived to our room initially, they had a beautiful spread of fruit, chocolates and roses laid out for me as a gift for our wedding.  I was very impressed.  The room was a nice size, super clean.  Would definitely recommend for a boutique, personalized experience!  (Walking Distance to Buckingham Palace, too!)"
January 2014,The Perfect Place To Stay,"My daughter and I plus 2 dogs had a 3 night break at Hotel 41. My expectations were high, from website and reputation and we certainly were not disappointed. In fact everything we experienced surpassed expectation. All the staff were attentive, polite and friendly. The bedroom was compact yet perfect, beds were wonderfully comfortable, as, I imagine the dog beds were. We loved sitting in front of the fire with friends (and dogs) in the evening. The pantry nibbles were irresistible.  Overall it was an excellent hotel, would recommend it without hesitation and shall return as soon as I have an excuse to do so. Thank you Hotel 41"
January 2014,Other worldly,"My daughter and I throughly enjoyed our week at Hotel 41.  It truly felt more like a home than a hotel, location close to Victoria station was great and the staff was exceptional!  The room was lovely and spotless, the food and beverage department top notch and the executive lounge so inviting and peaceful. Thank you so much Monica for the unexpected but truly appreciated treat!  It was like a palace!  Thank you everyone for making our trip magical. Only complaint...we had to leave!"
January 2014,Amazing team of staff,A really well located hotel. It has rather compact dimensions for those used to larger hotels. But the sheer size of the effort and care from the team was world class. We were so well taken care of we had a great New Year. A boutique cutie.
December 2013,Exceptional hotel,"The staff does everything right in this quaint boutique hotel near Buckingham Palace.  A great place to make your home while in London.   Fabulous.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else.   Before arriving, they send you a request list.  The little things are what really impressed me.  A bottle of bubbly waits for you.   Breakfast was fabulous.  They have a great ""honor"" bar if you want to make yourselves a drink. The complete opposite of a big chain hotel experience.    While it is not cheap, it represents great value.  I felt like I was staying in a nice London home.  The executive lounge is cosy and free wifi worked great.   "
December 2013,Great for the family!,We loved this hotel for our two kids ages 6 and 9. They had gluten free toast in the morning in addition to their gorgeous breakfast - and their snacks late night were delicious.  The staff was amazing with our kids and lovely without being overly on top of you (like at the Park Hyatt on Paris). It was by far the most interesting experience we have had - and have now decided to find other boutique hotels after this wonderful visit. 
December 2013,(Cliche Alert) A Hidden Gem!,"This was a surprise birthday trip planned by my wife in mid December. I knew we were staying in London at a hotel, but that was as much info as she was prepared to divulge. Clearly it was going to be somewhere very special.. and indeed it was! Coming off a wet and windy street through a tiny door into total opulence; and having a glass of champagne almost immediately thrust into my hand just took my breath away as I processed the surroundings. The fire! The chandeliers! The comfy chairs! The ice cream on tap! This was my kind of place and my wife clearly knew it. We were shown to the Balmoral suite which was approximating the size of our ground floor with its 4 TVs, sofas, tables, huge bed; I could go on with the superlatives but it would be overkill if I did.  Suffice to say‚Ä¶"
December 2013,A wonderful stay.....again!,"This was our second stay at hotel 41 and yet again we had an amazing time. We were welcomed back like old friends and made to feel very special.  We were given a different room this time and it was beautiful, we asked for a quiet room with lovely views and that's exactly what we got. Nothing is ever too much trouble for them and your every need is catered for. All of the little touches are what makes this place extra special, such as the champagne on arrival, the 'plunder the pantry', the lovely dressing gowns and the luxurious Penalagans  products....... I could go on but you really do just need to go along and experience it all for yourself, you will not be disappointed."
December 2013,Really the best.,"One of my favorites! Very comfortable and homey. Nice to sit in front of the fire and sip hot chocolate. Rooms are cozy, black and white prevail. Service excellent, small boutique hotel so they always remember your name and what you want before you do. Great breakfast and snacks in the clubroom. Excellent central location, not far from Piccadilly. Been there several times and will definitely be back!"
December 2013,Amazing!!,I love this hotel. We came here for my husbands 30th birthday and everything about our stay here was perfect! The level of customer service provided by all the staff was so far above anything I have experienced at any other hotel. I can't wait for our next trip to the UK to stay at this hotel again!
December 2013,Like a comfortable pair of slippers,Everything about Hotel 41 was carefully and thoughtfully planned to provide a luxury yet unobtrusive experience. From champagne at check in through to little personal touches in the room. The location of the hotel is excellent and the room was quiet ensuring a good nights sleep. The lounge served a great breakfast too! All in all a great hotel 
December 2013,To be taken care of is worth trying once in a while.,"41 is a small hotel. And small is beautiful a wise man said. He didn't think of 41, but who knows? This place is more a poem, or a work of art, than a hotel. It is not a base camp, it is the peak. You just don't want to leave the bed, the breakfast in bed, the fireplace, the mahogany shrine were afternoon tea or glowing wine is served under the glass roof. Very intimate, but not in an embarrassing manner.The staff is young and tenderly responding to all your needs without showing off. The waiters are descrete in a manner that challenges your pride.  Tranquille, but precise and to the point. British? I think so. Even the lampets have their own rythm. God must have smiled when he created 41 through the imagination of Bea Tollman. When I left I knew that this hotel will be more a‚Ä¶"
December 2013,Great place to stay,This place is really pricey but this is where i stay if im in london for businees or pleasure. I have been to many other estabs over the years but they give you the best. If youre a regular they give extra special srvice.
December 2013,Perfect weekend stay,"I've stayed at Hotel 41 previously and am more than pleased to say that it just doesn't change, you get friendly, attentive service with excellent efficiency, politeness and everything to the high standard you expect, having stayed in most of the top London hotels in the past since discovering 41 I will not stay anywhere else."
December 2013,"Wonderful,wonderful,wonderful!!!","My lovely husband booked a surprise birthday treat for me and we combined a stay at Hotel 41 with a visit to the theatre.  From literally the moment the taxi stopped outside Hotel 41 we were met by warm, attentive staff and nothing was too much trouble. The service was the best we had received anywhere.  Our room was a much needed peaceful haven, every detail was considered.  The quality of linens, towels and fittings are exceptional.  The phone has a button ""anything,anytime"" and that really does sum up the room service.  Upon arrival you are greeted with champagne, what a treat  - very good champagne!!  The food is superb and plundering the pantry after walking back from the theatre was most welcome.  The cheeses, hams, bread and fruit were just amazing, no leftovers here all‚Ä¶"
January 2013,Special Hotel for a Special Occasion,"Excellent service from very professional and caring members of staff in a superb well located boutique hotel with outstanding food, drink and facilities. Traveling to London to receive an award from the Queen was special enough but such an occasion was further enhanced through the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41."
November 2013,super,"Nothing realy special to say because everything was perfect. Thank  you Rooms clean and confortable, fireplace, staff very friendly, central location. We look forward to our return in London. Thank you de ""41"""
December 2013,Family trip to London,"My wife and I had enjoyed our stay at this hidden gem in 2010, and on this trip we brought our 3 children, ages 8, 11 and 16, for a 6 day vacation, their first transatlantic journey.  The junior suites were perfectly sized, and the kids made full use of the ""pantry"" every night.  The central location was an excellent base for adventures within and without the city limits.  If we ever return to London, we will want to stay at ""41""."
April 2013,Excellence in every respect!,"5 star boutique hotel. Extremely friendly staff. Incredibly nice people! They seem to know your name before you introduce yourself to the concierge. Nice and comfortable rooms, cozy living room for breakfast, snacks and drinks. You feel at home."
October 2013,I need to come back!,"This is most definitely my favourite hotel in London. The staff could not do enough for you, the rooms were a great size and the lounge made the hotel have that special touch.   The hotel itself is a joy to just roam around and enjoy the hotel setting, particularly a glass of champagne in front of the fire.   The prices for the rooms seem extremely reasonable in comparison to other 5* hotels on offer in the area we have stayed at.  The only downside was our shower did leak slightly, however we did not complain as it was not that much of a concern at the time! Definitely not enough to make us have a negative thought of this exceptional hotel.  I look forward to my return."
October 2013,Simply Perfect,"The team at the hotel should be commended for their customer service, every little detail is catered and cared for.  Check in smooth with complimentary champagne and relaxed too, valet parking a bonus!"
September 2013,"41 is a ""10""","We just returned from a European trip that concluded with three nights at ""41"", what a great way to end a great vacation.  The hotel is conveniently located a block from Victoria Station and the only thing nicer than the surroundings is the staff.  We were checked in by Monika and treated like family.  She along with the rest of the staff are great representatives of the property and made us (excuse the pun) ""feel like royalty"".  I am looking forward to a return trip to London and I would not consider any other hotel."
September 2013,Splendid!,"After traveling & experiencing many outstanding hotels during our 15+ years of world travel we pretty much have seen it all when it comes to 5 Star service however this hotel manages to squeeze out even more in the department of personalized service.  The Concierge team has a knack of anticipating your next move and is always at your service 24/7, ready to spring into action whether it be for a restaurant reservation, Buckingham Palace Tours or general directions.  No request appears to be a challenge for this group of go-getters.    Housekeeping gets 5 gold stars in my book.  Our room was made up each day as expected but the entire room received a thorough sprucing up each day.  These are the little things that we took notice of.  The rooms are chock full of comfy-ness. ‚Ä¶"
September 2013,Great service,"Really friendly service, comfortable room and good location.  Lots of nice little touches.  I really enjoyed the check-in in the lounge.  It's nice to have a comfy seat while checking in after a long flight.  The turn-down service was fantastic.  Would love to return!"
September 2013,Simply superb - staff are impeccable,"Hotel 41 This truly is a special hotel in London and with a great location on Buckingham Palace Road, right opposite the entrance for the  Royal Mews ‚Äì a few minutes‚Äô walk to Victoria Station, just down the road to Buckingham Palace and about seven minutes‚Äô walk to Green Park tube (through the park) it‚Äôs a great location for the area.  Having been to London many times and stayed in numerous hotels (The Royal Gardens at Kensington and The Sofitel in St James on 3 occasions  Hotel 41 is my new favourite.  Certainly not inexpensive (even without converting to the Australian Dollar) but where else do you get seated at check in and offered complimentary ‚ÄòVerve‚ÄôChampagne and have a complimentary  open pantry 24 hours a day.

January 2013,Home away from home in London,"First and foremost, I must commend the outstanding staff, and to call them ""staff"" almost belittles the degree to which they enhanced our stay. Everyone we encountered was friendly, competent, and eager to please. On our first full day in London, we decided to take a break from sightseeing and called the hotel to see if they could arrange an afternoon tea in the Executive Lounge. I thought this last minute request might be hard to accommodate but was greeted with ""No problem, what time would you like your tea?"".  That tea, by the way, was excellent as were all the meals we had at Hotel 41. The breakfast selection was extensive and delicious. I'd also like to note that the Hotel's Bbar restaurant (street level) was surprisingly good.  Guest rooms are nice, quiet, and well‚Ä¶"
October 2013,excellent,"We had a wonderful stay at the Hotel. It was on the day of my son's wedding and the hotel kindly made our rooms available early for us to change before hand. The staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly and gave us a round of applause as we left for the service.  The rooms very beautifully appointed, spotlessly clean and the bed the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Breakfast was excellent. On reaching home I realised that I had left the bridal bouquet in our room. We called the hotel and it was located, put in water and kept safe until we could return to collect it the following day. They even provided a suitable pottery container to carry the flowers in.  I would strongly recommend this hotel and hope to stay there again sometime."
August 2013,Quaint and attentive staff.,"My husband and I are just leaving the hotel after spending 3 nights in this excellent hotel.  The staff is attentive and charming.  The hotel has a old world feel to it however all the modern comforts are present in this hotel.  The hotel encompasses the essence of London, blending the old with the new.  Excellent Location."
September 2013,Charming,I have shared this hotel with everyone.  It is beautiful when you walk through the doors and the staff is overwhelmingly delightful.  It is a pleasant surprise to go upstairs.  The location is also perfect.  We will be back.üòÄ
August 2013,"Exquisite, Boutique, Hideaway from reality - in the perfect location!","With only having the opportunity to stay in London for a couple of days I am so glad we chose to stay here, the experience provided by the staff at Hotel 41 was one I will remember as a highlight of our month long vacation. A huge benefit of staying here is the location, we managed to see so many sights of London from the centre point 'Buckingham Palace Road' and what better way to finish off your day of sightseeing than to be relaxing in the Executice Lounge with a glass of champagne and some afternoon tea in front of the fireplace. I would highly recommend this Hotel and I will definitely be staying here again. Well done to the staff at Hotel 41 - outstanding customer service."
August 2013,The Hotel Staff helped to make our vacation wonderful.,"First time in London.  The staff at Hotel 41 were very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.  Had a wonderful time  The hotel was convenient to everything.  The Executive Lounge provided a perfect spot for breakfast and relaxation with a drink and snack after a day of site seeing  Overall great experience."
August 2013,The hotel to be in London,If you can spend some money in a extraordinary hotel be sure to book the Hotel 41. I have never seen suich efficient smooth and graceful service . We had a wonderful stay at this hotel which does not look as a hotel. Everything was just perfect.
August 2013,Best Boutique Hotel,"From the minute you enter the Hotel lobby until the time you checkout, you will have a wonderful experience.  The hotel is very unique, in fact it occupies the entire 5th floor of the adjacent Rubens Hotel.  It has a wonderful lounge where you can get a glass of wine, a late night snack or full service menu. The friendliness of the staff and the service they provide are unparalleled and they take care of your every request or need.  In my case they purchased for me several front of the line tickets to exhibitions in London and tickets for Billy Elliot.  I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there the next time I am in London."
August 2013,Another amazing stay at Hotel 41,"My husband and I first stayed here after our wedding last year, and had such a great experience that we promised we'd be back. And we've just been back...this time for my birthday. Hotel 41 did not disappoint. From the minute we walked in the door the service was exceptional. Room was great with lots of space and everything we needed. My husband had booked afternoon tea as a treat and it was amazing. The cakes were all designed with a celebration theme for Prince George which was lovely. I was also treated to a very unexpected birthday cake which was delicious! After going out for the evening we came back and ""plundered the pantry"" whilst drinking champagne in the lounge - incredibly relaxing place to spend time. Breakfast the following morning was excellent, as it was last time‚Ä¶"
August 2013,Interesting property that shake all day and late into the night,"I tried to stay here in August and had to move hotels due to the construction site across the street - the bed, hotel, everything was shaking as they drilled and dug and drilled again. It is a very interesting property - quite stylish, unique layout, and wonderfully helpful staff, but I do wonder what they are thinking when they book people in. It is not as if the construction sight is new, so why don't they warn you?  It got so bad that I had to move across town to another one of their fellow accommodations which was less than convenient. All in all, I would not recommend booking here until the construction is done - it is just not relaxing."
November 2012,Exceptional Service - Memorable Experience,"We spent 3 memorable nights at 41 last week and can say without reservation that 41 is the finest hotel in which my wife and I have had the pleasure of staying in over 30 years of travel for business and pleasure. The service was simply outstanding and without doubt the best we have ever experienced. The attention to detail and proactive approach of the staff is second to none. The hotel consists of only 28 rooms and is very cozy and warm. The Executive Lounge, with its unique atmosphere reminiscent of a mansion library, was the ideal setting in which to start our day with a great breakfast and in which to end our day with a night cap from a terrific selection of premium single malt scotch whiskies, wines, beer and spirits.  Consumption is based on the honor system and recorded‚Ä¶"
August 2013,Amazing!,"Hotel 41 is a fabulous place to stay. The atmosphere is beautiful, quiet, and lovey. It has delicious breakfast, perfect afternoon tea with champagne and a great night cap service with hors d'oeuvres and all; plus 24hr ice cream! I stayed here for three nights with my husband; we have two small children and would probably not stay here with them.  I think small children probably need a larger hotel with kid friendly activities/play center.  But if you want elegant pampered service, this is the place to stay.  They will pamper and cater to your every whim. This is a perfect London Hotel.  It sits across the street from Buckingham Palace, a short distance to pubs, shopping, and the tub and train stations.  Wonderful all around. I can‚Äôt wait to go back."
August 2013,An experience,"The second time that my wife and I have stayed at this hotel. Exceptional hotel, service and overall environment. Nothing is too much trouble and we will certainly stay again when we are next in London. Try the Champagne experience in the Leopards Bar - an excellent way to unwind. All of the food was cooked to a high standard and was delightful"
August 2013,Simply Outstanding!,"Well... I don't really know where to start to be honest!  Outstanding, Exceeded guests expectations, Amazing experience, 100% Guest satisfaction are all things that come to mind when trying to sum up my stay at Hotel41 London.  I stayed here a total of 5 nights / 6 days with Family (My Mum) and right from the time I was greeted at the main door on a Saturday night at 11:15pm to the time I left the same main door it was like a home away from home.  No matter what the query (small, large or insignificant) ALL the staff went above and beyond to help in any way they could which as a guest makes it just that much more reassuring and helps in enjoying the holiday!  In my profession customer service is absolutely crucial and Hotel41 showed exactly how it's done on all levels. Having‚Ä¶"
June 2013,"Like a catered, private flat","Where to start? You know how at most hotels there is usually one, maybe two people who run around and really have the ability to sort out whatever need or problem you have? Imagine a small luxury hotel with a battalion of people with that kind of star treatment attitude and authority. At the same time, the personal touch was never overbearing -- just enough to make sure we made full use of the hotel. Service is without a doubt outstanding.  The hotel itself is laid out like an eccentric rabbit warren of corridors -- you will find this either endearing or annoying. We found it endearing, and had an informal competition to see who could first find a route to the private elevator without recourse to going through the lounge.   The lounge itself is really the only common area of‚Ä¶"
July 2013,Great boutique hotel with fabulous service,"Believe the other reviews, on TA, the hotel is ideally situated right across from the Royal Mews and easy access to all of London.  But what really makes it great is the incredible staff and the service they provide.  Lauren and the rest of the staff are true gems, engaging in genuine conversation with the guests in the luxurious common room  and going out of their way to make our stay memorable.  I've been to London a few times but  this was the best ever thanks to the staff at Hotel 41.  Hats off to all of you."
July 2013,An Exquisite Charm,"We only stayed in London two nights, once on our travels to Paris and once on the way back home - had I known how lovely our stay would be at Hotel 41 I would have made arrangements to stay longer! The service was impeccable, the lodging and appointments uniquely British and extremely 5 star quality.  Malcolm arranged every detail of our stay, Stefan and the front desk staff welcomed us with champagne and Monica followed up to confirm that every aspect was perfect. I would thoroughly recommend this little charm to anyone visiting London for a first time or for the seasoned traveler looking for a lovely British property!"
July 2013,Exceptional service to make you feel at home,"You feel welcome from the moment you walk through the door. As a business traveller, lots of little things help ease work stress.  These include the lounge which has complimentary, excellent quality food always available, canapes daily from 18.00  and a community fridge with bottles of water you are welcome to take on your way out. The tables in the lounge are spaced so you have privacy, where you can work somewhere other than your room.  I was there until 1am a couple of nights and someone periodically offered a hot drink.  All the staff based in the  lounge were thoughtful and offered exceptional service. Our room had a good sized desk and a stationary draw with items such as scissors, sticky tape, paper clips - handy.  And free WiFi throughout - a condition of any hotel I‚Ä¶"
June 2013,outstanding,"This is opulent old school style, great room and facilities excellent service so many complimentary items like ice cream in hot weather not cheap but great value. This would be a very difficult place to fault beautiful setting just wonderful."
July 2013,Just about perfect... and there ain't no such thing as perfect!,"A combination of business and pleasure brought my party to London. I booked two rooms. From check-in to check-out the staff was, indeed, perfect. Invariably, on a seven-day stay, situation, requests, issues come up. The staff dealt with every one, solved every problems, secured every dinner reservation, arranged every transport, fulfilled every request with aplomb and courtesy and sincere ""at-your-service"" attitude. Stefan Otto and ALL of the floor staff, from reception to servers to doormen to maids... just unfailing service with a charming smile.  The facility is charming, polished and spotlessly clean... maybe the coolest boutique hotel setting in the West (Upper House in Hong Kong still gets best-boutique-hotel-in-the-world in my book). I loved the small size and warren of‚Ä¶"
June 2013,"Treated like royalty, wonderful service, cool a/c","We stayed three nights at Hotel 41. Upon arrival we were greeted with two glasses of Champagne. We were actually given our choice of preferred Champagne. Service and checkin were flawless. It is hard to describe the ambiance at 41. We enjoyed the executive lounge with snacks, fresh bread, drinks available at all times. The hallways and rooms are very European with low ceilings, many mirrors, wood, nicely decorated. Very quaint. We enjoyed our conversations with Stefan Otto and our bellman Brogdan was very attentive and helpful. All the staff was wonderful. The only flaw of our stay was some problems with the main elevator. Normally this would have been a major issue, but the attentiveness of the staff and the accommodations made up for this big time. It is very easy to miss‚Ä¶"
May 2013,We were made to feel like we were Royalty!,"If you aren‚Äôt careful, you may just miss this sweet little Gem of a Boutique Hotel, placed in a superb location ~ right across the street from the Queen‚Äôs ‚ÄòMews‚Äô (where Queen Lizzie stores her Royal Coaches, Bentleys, Rolls, and such.) When you drive up to 41 Buckingham Palace Rd, the more prominent fa√ßade of the sister ‚ÄòRed Carnation‚Äô Hotel, ‚ÄòThe Rubens‚Äô, sits immediately next door to the entrance of ‚ÄòHotel 41‚Äô. Hotel 41 actually occupies the 5th floor of what used to be the Rubens Hotel Ball Room, but now holds 30 beautifully appointed rooms of this very special and classically British residence.  When my wife and I arrived at the 41, we were escorted to a stylish elevator lift, which took us to the reception desk located in the Executive Lounge on the 5th floor. We were‚Ä¶"
August 2012,Wonderful stay -- helpful staff,"We are already planning our next stay at Hotel 41.  From the moment we arrived after our overnight flight from the US, the staff was perfect.  From arranging for us to have a ""temporary"" room until our room was cleaned to offering us breakfast (we slept through the United Airline breakfast) -- our first day in London started much better than anticipated.    The team was always willing to make restaurant suggestions (which were great) and helpful hints on things to see.  Our favorite part of the day was heading back ""home"" for tea and biscuits.    We reserved an Executive King, which was bigger than we had expected.  Next time, we plan to upgrade to the suite.  After our stay, Hotel 41 is now in my wife's top 3 hotels in the world."
July 2013,One of the best places to stay!,I've been lucky to stay at Hotel 41 several times and every time has been wonderful. The hotel staff are incredibly service oriented and no ask is too small. The rooms are beautifully decorated. Location is great. Cannot say enough good things about this hotel!
July 2013,Perfectly Classic British,"Unfortunately we were only able to stay at this hotel one night and my husband and I both wished we were able to stay longer.  I really love small personal boutique hotels and 41 is just that - personal in every way.  First the hotel is in a great location - directly across the street from Buckingham Palace.  Upon arrival we were greeted with a lovely glass of champagne - what's better than that!!!  Our room was perfect - black and white decor with British prints on the wall, comfortable king size bed with soft linen, well appointed bathroom, plenty of storage space if you like to unpack - even with drawers in the bathroom, sofa and chair in the room, and the best - a fireplace!!!!  Our room was down the hall from the lounge - decorated like a beautiful sitting room.  Breakfast‚Ä¶"
September 2012,Amazing,"Ill start by stating we are very fussy travelers and this hotel exceeded our expectations. We found 41 on tripadvisor and was also recommended by a friend. We stayed at 41 for 3 nights from the 15 July and it was not enough. This boutique hotel had every detail covered. The staff were fantastic and made us feel so welcome. The rooms were very nice, clean and every little detail had been thought of. We traveled with our 2 children and the hotel and staff catered for all of there needs, from slippers, miniature dressing gowns and most important ice cream on tap! The food was divine.  The staff offered amazing recommendations for food, places of interest and shopping. My family and I look forward to returning again in the near future. Hotel 41 thanks again!!!!"
June 2013,Great service and private club ambiance,"I stayed several times at ""41"" and I like the fact that is almost a little ""secret"". Situated on a high floor in the same building of the Rubens Hotel t5he ""41"" has the feeling of a private club. The concierge service is one of the best I have experienced in London, the staff is really helpful and knowledgeable. The breakfast and tea services are terrific and I love the idea of the pantry in the library always ready for a drink or a snack even in the middle of the night. The rooms are pretty if a bit small and the location is great for sightseeing,k a little less for shopping however the Victoria tube is very close and so is the station with the train that comes in right from Gatwick airport."
July 2013,41: the best,I have been many times in the 41 - and there is a reason for this: the 41 provides that kind of service that is only achieved by professionals who are competent and love their job. Service is impeccable and allow me to relax after a hard day's work with sometimes 8 - 10 meetings with various business partners. The staff's attention to detail always surprises me - and I am a hard taskmaster - almost never giving a perfect score - but the 41 comes as close as I can think of: 9.99 out of 10   :-)
May 2013,One of the best hotels in which I have stayed!!,"I have done extensive business and personal travel internationally, and have a high standard as I was - for a while - a senior executive in the hospitality industry.  So, when I indicate Hotel 41 is one of the best, it is against a very high standard.  My wife and I were in London for a wedding, and chose Hotel 41 based on the many positive reviews.  I have also stayed, on a previous trip, at Milestone - and in the case of both properties have been impressed by Red Carnation Hotels.  The things I liked were numerous, but heavily focused on the impressive team assembled at Hotel 41.  Stay learned our names and our likes/dislikes quickly, and were responsive to our wishes almost as if they read minds.  The service was better than any Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton in which I have‚Ä¶"
June 2013,Wonderful hotel with wonderful ambiance,"Lovely weekend stay , check in experience was exceptional (especially if you like Champagne). Service and atmosphere outstanding though room (junior suite) bit cramped .  Also excellent central location."
July 2013,Feels like a private club,"I traveling frequently to London on business and have stayed at many hotels, but I always go back to the 41 for several reasons. Small, luxurious, private hotel which feels like a private club. Responsive staff who go the extra mile to know you and your needs. Comfortable, well appointed rooms with in-room computer system. No need to bring your laptop. I can check my e-mail, surf the internet, work on documents, print or fax them--all from my bed. THe lounge is inviting and well stocked with drinks, snacks, sandwiches, fruits etc. Before going to my room at the end of the day, I always stop in the lounge for a drink. The one minor drawback is the 41 is not conducive for meetings. They do have a state-of-the-art meeting room for guests to use, but there really isn't come meet me‚Ä¶"
June 2013,Kim and Paul at 41,We chose this hotel as it had a very good rating with Trip Advisor and were not disappointed.  The hotel is located in a very good area for getting around central London and the service the staff provided was second to none.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone and we will definitely be staying there on our return trips to London.
July 2013,Excellent Experience at Hotel 41 in London,"My husband and I wanted to make sure that this hotel was recognized for its outstanding service and accommodations. There was literally nothing they would not try to do for us. We especially like the button on the phone that said 'anything, anytime' and that is exactly what they meant!  Would recommend this hotel to anyone, anytime !"
July 2013,"Staff are 1st class - real gems - and beds, what more can you say...","Stayed here over the weekend as part of our visit for the London 2012 Anniversary race at the Olympic Stadium. The hotel is situated a very short walk from Victoria tube station and right across the road from the Mews at Buckingham Palace. As we entered my daughter said it‚Äôs a bit like Alice in Wonderland inside, it is truly magical.  As you can see from my profile we stay in hotels across the world, and I have been fortunate to stay in some great places, but this one from a staff perspective is the best, really interested in you, very well trained, ready smile, helpful, endearing, you could go on. Well done everyone from the cleaning staff upwards.  Upon arrival you are offered a complimentary glass of chilled champagne, and it is chilled, whilst you check in, and there are‚Ä¶"
May 2013,Do not regret not staying here !!,"Wow wow wow !! Got told about this hotel and it was even better in person , all the previous reviews I had read are absolutely spot on , all staff are exceptionally sincere , professional and take pride in their workplace. Comfortable , clean and yet again a perfect central location - only wish I had stayed here my whole trip !! Will be back for sure and can't recommend highly enough "
June 2013,Amazing Ambiance and Service,"We spent three nights at Hotel 41 starting off the European portion of our honeymoon. Upon check-in, we decided to upgrade from an executive suite to their Conservatory suite, to get the maximum 41 experience. Although very pricy, the suite was amazing. We had a stay-three-pay-two package that offered a full English breakfast with all the trimmings.  Service at 41 was second to none! Lauren and her staff did, as other reviewers have stated, ""treated us like royalty"".   We tried the optional Leopard bar champagne experience that was an amazing mix of food and champagne in a very romantic atmosphere with highly personalized service. Highly recommended!  One night after dinner, returning to our  room with ""relies"", we saw that we were ""romantically rosed"". WOW! We returned to find‚Ä¶"
July 2013,Meets Expectations And More,"My wife and I recently spent five nights at Hotel 41 as part of an anniversary celebration.  We were excited to go because of the excellent reviews we read on TA.  I have to say this hotel provided an experience beyond what we could have conjured.  What makes this hotel distinct is the level of service provided to  the guests.  I cannot imagine you will experience anything better.  From check-in, with a glass of champagne of your choice, to check-out we were treated in royal fashion. Any problem or request was undertaken in a flash, often by more than one of the mangers.  Service in the Lounge was exemplary.  Let me give special thanks to managers Stefan and Monika for making our stay special.  We stayed in an Executive King room.  Although it was not large there were many‚Ä¶"
July 2013,Still an excellent hotel,Staff is working 24/7 to make your stay as pleasant as possible. 2 Nights in this hotel makes you want to come back for more. The staff thinks in solutions not in unanswered questions. As I said before this is a gem in London. We will be back.
June 2013,Can't wait to return!,"Lovely experience from beginning to end.  My daughter and I stayed at Hotel 41 only one night, sadly, but it was an exquisite end to two weeks in England and France.  I absolutely cannot wait to bring my husband back to this divine hotel.  Elegant, comfortable, well-appointed boutique hotel, and the staff could not be any more attentive and accomodating.  I have stayed in $10K per night rooms in Las Vegas hotels, and I have never experienced service and quality equal to Hotel 41.  This hotel makes the horrible 10 hour flight from the USA (even with rude flight attendants) worthwhile.  I'm plotting to get back to London at Christmas now."
January 2013,Congratulations on Hotel of the Year Award!,"Congratulations, Team 41 on your well-deserved Catey Award for Hotel of the Year. I read in the news that "" The Cateys"" are the hotel industry's version of The Oscars, so this is confirmation of your position at the very pinnacle of the business.  As regular monthly guests we always look forward to our visits and in a fortnight (our next one) we will be looking out for the Catey statue itself which we hope is on display in the Executive Lounge.  But most of all, we will look forward to congratulating the team in person.  Very well done, all of you.  See you  soon.  Celia"
June 2013,We're coming back!,"My husband & I are eagerly awaiting our fourth stay at 41. We adore this elegant, comfortable & welcoming hotel. Each time we arrive back after an outing it feels as if we've arrived home.  All the staff are very attentive & showed great concern when my husband was unwell. They even welcomed visits & breakfasts dates with our London daughter. No better place to stay."
May 2013,Amazing hotel in London,"We just returned from our trip to London and had to share our amazing experience. From the time we checked in until check out, we were treated to the most wonderful service, professional and helpful staff,  and a luxurious, comfortable room at this hotel. The staff, who know you by name, are available at all times to help with reservations, recommendations, maps, tickets or whatever you could possibly need while in London. They went above and beyond to be helpful but never intrusive. We felt so at home while there. The location is ideal for walking everywhere as it is centrally located to all of London's main attractions and shopping.  Also walking distance to the tube. The little touches of his/her slippers, the candle lit in the bathroom at night, the warmed towels and the‚Ä¶"
June 2013,Like staying with family,"Beginning with the hallway-reception leading only to one lift, the well-appointed yet traditionally styled bedrooms, beautiful but small bathrooms, quirky location on the top floor of the Ruben and sound-padded yet creaky hallways, this hotel definitely does not fit into the usual 5-star experience offered by other chains.  I realised the issues for other reviewers when they complained about odd-shaped rooms, lack of view, small ground floor foyer, no pool or staff that were almost intrusive. I would say that Hotel 41 does not endeavour to be a high-rise luxury modern facility so commonly available.  Instead, their forte is in their staff and service. Champagne at check-in. Reception staff were guaranteed to be smiling and eager to offer recommendations for restaurants, shows or‚Ä¶"
December 2012,Charming small hotel with great location,"My wife and I were on our 30th anniversary vacation. I found this hotel online and it had wonderful reviews. They were well deserved. The staff is attentive and professional. The central lobby/restaurant/lounge is staffed 24/7. There are very nice complimentary foods and beverages available all the time. At 2 am, the staff was able to solve a power adapter problem easily. They also pay attention to detail. We came into our very nice room one night to find candles and rose petals - so nice for a romantic honeymoon trip. They even had an anniversary cake and candle for us in the room one night. All in all a wonderfully attentive and romantic hotel. Even the location across from Buckingham palace was great. The great topper was the price of the hotel was lower than any of its‚Ä¶"
May 2013,What a hotel - breathtaking!,"We stayed for a Christmas break - the third time we'd been to this hotel. It is a luxurious and indulgent experience from beginning to end. Spacious and stylish rooms, comfortable beds, large baths, fluffy towels and gowns, great food - what's not to like??  The staff are always on hand if needed and unfailingly helpful - nothing is too much trouble. Location is decent - fairly central and a short stroll from Victoria Station and the parks.  We'd asked for something 'Christmassy' when booking at were delighted to find mini mince pies, christmas chocs and crackers in our room. Little details and the personal touch make such a difference. They keep your preferences on file so you'll find your favourite drinks waiting for you on arrival."
June 2013,Wow! We can't wait to go back!,"The best hotel experience ever! Prior expensive London stays elsewhere have been hit and miss. 41 was worth every penny! Brilliantly clean, delightfully comfortable, decadently luxurious! Amazingly, the staff were ALL helpful and friendly. They made it their business to anticipate our needs and then some! They booked tickets to WICKED for us and before we even went to the theatre, there was an autographed poster from the show on our bed! When we got back from the show, there were candles and rosepetals arranged all over the room! The guest lounge has a superb honour bar, delicious nibblies. These people put the boutique in boutique hotel!! If you want to spoil yourself for a night or a week in London, this is the place to do it!"
May 2013,Incomparable service,"We have stayed at several 5 stars however, ""41"" was unique in a couple of respects.  First and foremost, the staff. The entire staff was supremely attentive.  How they all seemed to know our names from day one is a mystery.   They made us feel very special and volunteered to attend to details so that we could just enjoy the vacation. Like having your own personal staff.  Second, the ""boutique"" facility.  Loved it. Comfortable and classy with special touches like heated towel rods.  And everything that we wanted was right there just a few steps away.  Definitely like the small, boutique setup.  We will be back!!!"
June 2013,Exceptional stay for our anniversary,"This was one of the best if not the best hotel we have ever stayed at. The staff, room, service, amenities were amazing. The staff was exceptionally attentive, helpful, and engaging. Very luxurious rooms and clean bathrooms, great location. The executive lounge well stocked with foods throughout the day and night and very pleasant to relax in. We were on a three week trip through Europe for our 30th anniversary, the staff made our first night special with extra attention, our stay at Hotel 41 was by far our best hotel experience in Europe."
June 2013,Excellent Venue & Staff,"Most enjoyable trip. This hotel is a hidden Gem! Staff was beyond excellent, rooms were excellent. Lounge was convenient and cozy. Again the staff went above and beyond to make you feel welcomed, and important."
June 2013,Unforgettable weekend,"I am lucky to have just spent the weekend at this fantastic hotel. From the moment we walked in to a champagne meet & greet, the whole experience was completely customer focused.  The staff cannot do enough for you, the surroundings are stylish, and you do not feel anonymous at all. I could go on and on but suffice to say we will be back, especially as the other half proposed to me with lots of secret help from the staff! Thank you Hotel 41! "
May 2013,Have they paid for the No 1 spot???,"This hotel basically consists of the top floor of the Ruben¬¥s hotel, located right next door. They have tried to create a clubby atmosphere by setting up an executive lounge that is the center of the ""hotel"", where you eat and drink 24 hrs. This is quite cozy. The rooms are well-designed and the bathrooms are ok, if  somewhat aged. The TV, hidden away in a cabinet is too small to view, and looks like it was acquired in the end of the nineties. Further on the downside, there is no gym, spa or pool. Now, considering those downsides and the price of 410 pounds per night that I paid you would expect excellent service. I did not get that. The room I got faced a construction site (they have demolished the next block and are rebuilding it) where they were drilling at one o¬¥clock in the‚Ä¶"
June 2013,Best kept secret in London!,"First-class hotel - second to none!  From arrival to departure, I cannot find any criticism with Hotel 41 whatsoever.

May 2013,Service service service,"Spent our last two nights here before flying home to Australia, and wow what an experience, we felt like royalty. We arrived to be greeted by the doormen who arranged to park the car. We were then taken upstairs to the check in lounge, wow, choice of 4 kinds of champagne's while we checked in. Then we were shown to our rooms first being our other travel companions, their room was huge with fireplace, huge bed, huge bath, separate shower. Then we were shown to our room, well it was tiny, had to shimmy round the bed, it felt quite claustrophobic in comparison. We complained to staff as we'd paid the same price we'd expected the same as theirs. They said they'd see what they could do, we went for a walk out and on arriving back was given a new room, wow that was much better. The‚Ä¶"
June 2013,"Wonderful, exceptional hotel","We stayed here for our honeymoon and had an absolutely fantastic time. We were greeted with a lovely room decorated with roses and some petit fours, which was very much appreciated. The room itself was very cute, though I must admit it was a bit cramped for the price. The hotel itself is lovely, occupying a single floor atop another, slightly lesser quality sister hotel. Hotel 41 also has a very nice library where you take tea as well as delicious food and snacks.   One thing that really struck us was how friendly the staff at 41 was. Every single staff member learned our names within the first day and many of them had long conversations with us during tea and such. It was an absolute pleasure and really gave the hotel a very warm feeling. It was absolutely perfect for a‚Ä¶"
June 2013,Simply the Best,"I stayed at the hotel for one night on 16/06/13 as a ""treat"" for my partners birthday. I chose it for the simple fact it was (at the time) rated No.1 on Tripadvisor.   It is, without doubt, the BEST hotel I have ever stayed at. The place oozes quality the minute you walk through the door. The staff are just the best - on arrival our bags were taken to the room - and we were offered (and gratefully accepted) not one, but two glasses of champagne during check in. This included a brief talk advising us of the amenities in the Executive Lounge (the main reception and dining room) which included free snacks and soft drinks (the ""snacks"" included smoked salmon, an array of superb cheeses, fruit etc). There was even a freezer full of Hagen-Daz ice-cream.  The room was, like everything‚Ä¶"

May 2013,Lovely hotel; lovely service,"I just completed a week's stay at the hotel.  I chose it based on TripAdvisor reviews and its proximity to Victoria Station for access to the train to Glyndebourne.  I could not have picked a better choice.  Having read about the construction noise, I asked for a quiet room, which the staff provided.  From the interior, I heard nothing and slept well in the comfortable room.  All amenities were fine and on a par with excellent big city hotels.  But most importantly, the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful, which makes 41 rather unusual for a big city hotel.  I highly recommend it."
February 2013,Lovely small hotel,"I chose this hotel because of the reviews on trip advisor and I'm glad I did. The location was good being two minutes walk from Victoria, the staff were very attentive and the room was very cosy. We had breakfast and dinner at the hotel and both very good, my boyfriend was adamant that the eggs benedict were the best he had ever had. In the evening they have ""raid the larder"" where you can get loads of different nibbles to have with your per dinner drinks free of charge, everything from crisps and nuts to mini cottage pies and ice cream. The staff allowed us to open a bottle of our own wine to have with our fabulous afternoon tea as we had recently returned from Italy and bought a couple of bottles back with us which we thought was very good. We also had a lovely full body‚Ä¶"
June 2013,Attentive Service,"What I Liked Most  Attentive service, the extra touches  What I Liked Least The corridors are a maze and poorly signposted, power cuts  Stayed here for 3 bitterly cold February days.  After navigating 5 flights of stairs because of the power cuts (there was construction outside), we were welcomed in the library with a drink of our choice (not the usual take-it-or-leave-it fruit punch). Of course we could not go to our room because there was no power.  At least there were candles in the library.  The library is tastefully African-themed, where you get (excellent) breakfast, and where we also enjoyed afternoon tea (included).  The staff are friendly and welcoming without being intrusive.  Point to note though: the desk is by the door and when you walk in, there are frequently a‚Ä¶"
June 2013,Shhhhhhhhhhhh.,"Shhhhhhh, don't tell anyone: All the reviews are true. This is a truly fabulous hotel, the most attentive staff, delightful rooms and the most comfortable beds and all within meters of Buckingham Palace, but lets keep it secret ?"
June 2013,Simply the best I've ever experienced.,"Unfortunately I only stayed here one night and how disappointed I was!! I wish I could have stayed a week at least!   I arrived at Victoria station and was unsure which way to go so I rang the hotel for advice. They told me to wait where I was and promptly collected me! How fantastic!   I immediately felt comfortable and welcome in the hotel, the check in was seamless, efficient and very warm. And the glass of champagne on arrival was most appreciated too!   The rooms are beautiful, luxurious in every sense of the word and extremely comfortable.   Now what makes this hotel stand out is the staff. They are exceptional and SO professional. You cannot possibly fault any of them! It is simply the best service I've ever encountered.   The icing on the cake - I rang the hotel two days‚Ä¶"
June 2013,"Hidden jewel with exceptional service, the 5 star Hotel 41 exceeded our expectations.","We just returned from a week stay in London with our family.  We traveled with our two boys ages 17 and 13, my wife's parents and my mother.  We had 4 rooms for the family for the week.  The rooms were all very comfortable and charming, and the Executive Lounge was a great place to meet.  The service was extraordinary and the staff made everyone feel at home.  The resident manager Lauren was exceptional, and we felt like Remis, Stafan, and Monika were part of our family.  We enjoyed the breakfast every morning, and it was great coming back for tea and cocktails later each day.  The food service was outstanding and the restaurant at the adjoining hotel (the Bbar) was fabulous.  Although the hotel does not have a fitness center, they have full health club privileges at the LA‚Ä¶"
April 2013,Outstanding as always,"We have just spent our second wedding anniversary in a row at the 41. From the moment we were immediatly recognised and spoilt. This place is about personal service and personal touches. Complimentary fine champage whilst you check in sitting down in a comfortable fat leather chair.  We asked for the same executive room as last year which was done with no hassle at all and after enjoying an afternoon and early evening in London we returned to the executive lounge to enjoy wonderful complementry canapes and snacks finsihed of with hagan das icecream!  The Hotel team had arranged a suprise beautiful turn down service in the bedroom with rose petals on the bed and through out the room, candles and romantic music (michael Buble)  - just wonderful.  The late breakfast the next day‚Ä¶"
January 2013,Royal treatment next door to Buckingham Palace,"The charm of this 29 room hotel is set from the moment the door is opened and you are escorted to the check-in/reception on the 5th floor.  The staff is attentive, respectful and available to assist, as needed.  The room was bright, well appointed and housekeeping as attentive with impeccably cleaned rooms and they also employ ""green initiatives"" in reference to linen changes.  It has a great location with easy access to all we needed in London and we will return again and again.  Their food and beverage service is well planned and executed and will tailor to your needs.  If you travel to London, do not overlook this gem.  You will be happy you didn't!"
April 2013,A Secret Gem - Hotel 41,Old World Charm complimented by courteous service makes Hotel 41 one of the best hotels I've visited. Every staff member is helpful and whatever you need they will fulfill that comfort. Amenities are 5-star.
April 2013,Fabulous.,"We were in London for the Marathon and Hotel 41 made our stay unforgettable. They were very attentive in all aspects. The staff signed a card to cheer my husband on before the event. After they had a bouquet of roses in our room. They all took an interest in how he had done. The service was really the best we've had at a hotel. The rooms were well appointed, the bathroom had a separate shower & bathtub wt shower. Good water pressure! Turndown service too. The lounge was beautiful and they provided many complimentary snacks all day, scones, in he evening the pantry was stocked wt cheeses, breads, meats, ice cream and desserts. It was very appreciated and great quality. What we had off the menu was very good too. Location was very handy with the tube just a 2 minute walk away and‚Ä¶"
April 2013,A Thing of Beauty...,"Hotel 41 can best be described as the secret, luxury, top floor of the Reuben‚Äôs Hotel - the lift only goes from ground to fifth floor. We chose it for its proximity to the London Marathon finish and, boy, are we glad we did. Service is 5 star in that lovely 'you don‚Äôt know they are there' way; demeanour is chatty, almost gossipy, again in a good way. When they found out my girlfriend was running the marathon, a good luck card appeared signed by all the girls (I never saw any male staff during our 4 day stay). On finishing the race she found a 'congratulations' cake in the room and when we returned to it late that night rose petals and candles were everywhere. Unexpected, lovely, little flourishes cooked up, I have no doubt, by the girls themselves. This is the most romantic‚Ä¶"
April 2013,I won't stay anywhere else!,"My BFF and I stayed here for her birthday.  Thank you to Lauren, Laura and especially Remus!  The service was exceptional!  We loved the ability to plunder the pantry and sharing our adventure with the staff.  Overall everyone was helpful, charming and catered to all our needs."
May 2012,"A Perfect P,ace To Stay","My husband and and I just spent a few days in London and we were very impressed by not only the amazing location of Hotel 41, but also with the comfort of the bed, the amenities offered and the most courteous and helpful staff you can imagine.  There was not one thing that we asked for that we did not receive immediately and with a smile on their faces.  The rooms are not huge, but that was not something either of us felt bothered us, we would recommend Hotel 41 to anyone who would like to go to London...it was great!"
April 2013,Excellent Stay,We had an excellent stay at the Hotel 41. We were there the previous year and loved the hotel so much we came back. This time was perfect too. Monica made our stay perfect both times from start to finish. I had requested dinner reservations prior to our stay and she took care of everything.
May 2012,Romance all the way,"My partner and I spent two night last week end at 41 and I booked the romantic package. It was amazing all the way. We had a duplex suite where each can have some privacy. I recommend this choice since the regular rooms are a bit small and sitting in front of the fireplace, drinking a glass of Champagne was part of the pleasure.   The staff did not spare any efforts to make us feel home and all was done in a very professional and attentive way. Their advice for restaurants at night was very much what we were looking for.  In summary, a very memorable stay and we will definitively be back"
April 2013,What more could you want?,"There is a reason that this hotel is ranked so highly on these review websites. I will keep this one short. I have stayed in some incredible hotels, but nothing quite like hotel 41. While the staff, rooms, services, location etc are all beyond what anyone could expect, it is the atmosphere that really did it for me. The two nights that my partner and I stayed there seem like a dream. Sooo so good. I will be back!!"
April 2013,"No request too large, no detail too small","This must be the philosophie of the Hotel, this becomes evident during your stay. What a warm welcome by the charming hosts at the welcome desk, which is located in the cozy library/lounge. You feel like entering in some ones private home, which obviously is decorated in an exclusive style. The staterooms are in black and white, which gives it a contemporary touch. I enjoyed having a bathtub as well as a seperate rainfall shower, what a treat. The fluffy towels and the 100ml Penhaligon's bath and shower amenities add to the luxury. One does want to spend the full day in bed, made by Savoir and dressed with finest crisp linnen, what a feeling. I enjoyed sitting in the library close the fireplace having a drink and a barsnack, which is available around the clock. Breakfast ist‚Ä¶"
April 2013,If you want to be treated like royalty stay at 41 hotel.,41 hotel was the most amazing experience I have ever encountered on vacation.  The service was superb and the staff were attentive to your needs.  This is the only hotel that I want to stay in.  My friends and I were treated as royalty from the time we stepped foot out of our taxi.  Thanks to all the wonderful staff at 41 hotel.
March 2013,"The quality of service, attention to detail and luxury that EVERY hotel should aspire to!","I won't repeat the well deserved superlatives that Hotel 41 warrants, but our return visit proved that our findings on our first stay were far from a fluke! The staff are just as attentive, charming, genuinely friendly and live to ensure that you enjoy your stay. It's not difficult to revel in the luxuriance of this top quality hotel and nothing is too much trouble for every member of the young and professional staff headed by Lauren. The hotel is ideally situated. We found a lovely gem of a find around the corner from Hotel 41, The Westminster Cathedral, which, apart from being an impressively ornate Victorian Catholic cathedral, has a tower with awesome views across the London skyline in all directions. Save yourself ¬£24 (I understand its ¬£29 at The Shard)  and spend ¬£5 for an‚Ä¶"
April 2013,"Comfort, service and treat at hotel 41","As already described by others, the service in this botique hotel is pleasent and personalized. I noticed a few business people using the facilities as their living room, which of course is nice if the travel iteniary is intensive and you want to get away from the international branded hotels. My wife loved the hotel and room decoration.  After a busy day we were going out for dinner, and decided to have a drink in the library/bar/lounge and ended up staying there in front of the fireplace. We were kindly offered some nice appetizers and this took us further to the free buffet of a high standard. This is a nice treat. It seems to be a mixed clientele, business people, get-away holidayas and turists. The hotel situated next to buckingham palace invites to spend some time in the‚Ä¶"
April 2013,Hotel 41 - why I may never stay anywhere else in London again.,"We stay in London fairly frequently, and usually with children. This was our 48 hour ""escape break"" without children and Hotel 41 ticked all the boxes. For so many reasons it is rated number 1 in London and the rating is 100% accurate.  The welcome at the front desk was very friendly, and you felt expected. Cara was the lovely lady who came to greet us and accompany us upstairs. Check-in was accompanied by a glass of champagne and then we had a seat by the fire before being shown our room. Stylish, large for London, a wonderfully comfortable bed, pillow menu etc...all the small things that make you feel special. As this was a trip to celebrate our wedding anniversary, there were many special gifts from the hotel...a romantic turndown where the room was prepared for our return‚Ä¶"
April 2013,The Absolute 5 Star Hotel *****,"I currently live in Barnard Castle, and had a long trip journey to London and had just a bit of trouble finding the right Five Star Hotel. I found this place and currently inside the Hotel while writing this review.  The hotel experience by the server's are really briliiant and fabulous as they're speedness is skilled and extremely friendly. The sleep qualitiness is brilliant and everything else here is absolutely amazing.  There are no complaints in regards of this Hotel Experience with my family and friends. I don't hesitate to highly recommend this hotel for everyone who are going in a journey to London, this is the right place to stay for the trip.  The hotel is absolutely large and huge (at the same time), enough rooms for everyone. The rooms are very clean, good value for‚Ä¶"
May 2012,Great team,"a great combination of city and boutique hotel. the stuff is amazing and service oriented. rooms are big and comfortable. all the small bits and pieces are high quality and well needed. braekfast is great, room service is very good. location is tourististic oriented, not comfortable for shopping or city meetings, good for West End seekers. TV is small but u have one in the bathroom.  they have a special call button - ANYTHING, ANYTIME"
December 2012,Amazing hotel,"Small rooms, as you'd expect from an London hotel, but this is an amazing hotel none the less. The lounge is very comfortable, the staff are very attentive. I would recommend it but it is expensive. I would stay again"
March 2013,Amazingly Relaxed and Comfortable,"Stayed just before Xmas (sorry bit late catching up), for a pre-xmas break. Breakfast - best in London? Probably. Bed comfortable (stayed in junior suite). They think of everything here that makes you feel the most important person there.  The staff cannot do more for you, they are there just when you need them.  We enjoyed it so much we went back again in March and stayed in the same room. Also the Library Restaurant in the sister hotel next door is superb."
June 2012,Great place to stay,"We spent 3 nights at Hotel 41 (room 4106) and loved it.  We booked the English cooked breakfast option, but could also raid the continental breakfast bar while we waited for our food.  We utilised the ""Raid the Pantry"" service after 8:30pm when we returned from the Lion King show one night, and an evening tour of the Buckingham Palace State Rooms on another.  The location is great and we had an easy, leisurely walk with coffee stops and lunch on our first day passing or visiting the following sights - Royal Mews, Queen's Gallery, Admiralty Arch, Horse Guards Parade, Big Ben, London Eye, Palace of Westminster, 10 Downing Street, Trafalgar Square, Nelson's Column, Admiralty Arch, St James's Park.  A convenience store, restaurants and shops are behind the hotel and major stores are‚Ä¶"
March 2013,"Actually, it is the #1 hotel in London","My husband and I stayed there a year ago and, after reading the last reviewer, I felt the need to post. First of all, I have stayed at many 5 star hotels, all over the world, and Hotel 41 is one of the best. The location is unbelievable..it is right across the street from Buckinham Palace. So, it is not right in front of the ""gates,"" where no hotels are anyway, but, from our room, we could see inside the Palace walls. I remember watching guests arrive for the Queen's Julibee and this all happened right outside our hotel window. Secondly, the staff could not have been more welcoming, professional or knowledgable. Not only did they greet us with a glass of wine (pressed shirts and all), but they helped us out with dinner reservations & show tickets. The hotel is very exclusive,‚Ä¶"
March 2013,Not the Number 1 Hotel in London,"I want to start off by saying Hotel 41 is nice, but it is not the number 1 hotel in London. It doesn't have the beauty or service to be number 1. My wife and I were invited to the UK to attend the big Rugby International between Wales and England.  We decided to go a day early and spend a night in London.  Although we have been very satisfied with some top hotels on Park Lane in Hyde Park, we decided to take a look at other top properties in London to experience other fine hotels.  A friend recommended I pick the number 1 hotel on Trip Advisor.  Hotel 41 is listed as the top hotel in London so we booked it expecting the best.  When we arrived in London, the hotel transfer went smoothly from the airport.  The hotel is located on Buckingham Palace Lane which I thought would afford‚Ä¶"
March 2013,Really Super,"My sister and her husband often stay here and pursuaded us to book for our joint birthday and anniversary celebration. We were looked after like family and not that over the top, too smiley sort of service but genuinely gracious, competent service.  The sort of service which only comes from properly training and supporting your staff and understanding how to provide real luxury with ease.  The staff all knew each other and clearly wanted to be there and make sure you had a lovely time. The room was turned down beautifully and when it came to check-out, when I enquired what time it was, it was so refreshing to be told to ""take your time"", ""no rush - enjoy your Sunday morning"".  Having worked in the industry for a short time myself, I know this causes problems with Housekeeping‚Ä¶"
March 2013,Like Royalty,"We recently spent the week in London and enjoyed the magnificent 41 Hotel.  We did not know which hotel to select for our trip so we simply went to tripadvisor and chose the hotel with the #1 rating.  Turns out it was 41 Hotel and we were not at all disappointed!  After spending a week in our 'home away from home' we feel we must join the ranks of those who sing their praise.  My husband and I selected a suite as we were traveling with our 18 year old son.  The room was so comfortable and tastefully furnished.  It's not often the hotel rooms look like their pictures but in this case, the hotel really is as beautiful as we see online.  Monika, the assistant manager, went out of her way to make sure that not only were my husband and I comfortable but to make certain our son felt‚Ä¶"
March 2013,a week of royal indulgence,"I wanted to stay somewhere close to Buckingham Palace where I would be attending a ceremony to receive my CBE. This hotel could not be closer, opposite the Royal Mews and only a few minutes walk to the Palace gates. I booked 3 nights in a Junior Suite taking advantage of the 3 nights for 2 suite offer. My Aunt came down from Scotland for the event and we arrived on the Monday afternoon to a warm welcome and a glass of champagne. Contrary to a recent review we found the staff to be very genuine, friendly and eager to make our stay the very best that it could be. The suite was great and being split level, felt like a little flat. We arrived to tropical fruit and bottle of champagne on ice. We felt immediately relaxed and enjoyed our beauty sleep in preparation of the big day.‚Ä¶"
November 2012,Our London home,"Returning to our regular hotel - well, more of a return to our friends and the 41 family.  We stay here about once a month on business in the city and occasionally include leisure. On this occasion, it was a sudden need to be in Town for an extra fitting for a mother-of-the-bride outfit.  As always, the staff were welcoming, friendly and professional.  Our visit happened to coincide with my birthday week, which we celebrated with dinner at a favourite restaurant.  On our return, in addition to the card, there was a beautiful celebration turn down in our room, sincere felicitations from all the staff, including the housekeeper this morning.  As usual, our every need was catered for and often anticipated.  The raid the larder facility provided a late night cheese and port on the‚Ä¶"
May 2012,Disappointing!,"My fianc√©e and I were excited to stay here after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor but unfortunately the hotel did not live up to its reputation. The room was cramped and overfurnished with ageing furniture. We were woken at 5am every morning by staff walking in the corridor beside our room. The breakfast was mediocre and on occasions cold, as it was brought up from the kitchen at the hotel next door. The service was variable. The manager was delightful and helpful but some if her staff felt the need to patronise us and lacked authenticity. I think this hotel is trying to capture a private club environment but it just doesn't work. I have stayedvat private London clubs in the past and this felt like a Disney version. Would not stay again!"
March 2013,Probably the Best Hotel Experience Ever!,"This place is simply amazing! The entrance is tucked away beside the Ruben's hotel and is essentially one of the floors of this establishment run separately. The room we stayed in was the opulent Master Conservatory Suite which extends over two levels and boasts a massive skylight in the upstairs bedroom. A little noisy at night, but I suspect most places in central London are...  What sets this place apart though, are the people. There is a lounge room constantly staffed by the most knowledgeable, helpful and friendly people of any place we've stayed.Bar none. Period. They just welcomed us in, and made us feel at home right from the very start. Unobtrusive, but always immediately available. The lounge and all of its amenities felt like a spacious extension of our room, and the‚Ä¶"
March 2013,A great hotel in a great location in London.,A return visitor to Hotel 41. I think what makes this hotel stand out from the crowd is the focus on a high quality service. Of course the prime location is also a key factor. If your looking for cheap - go somewhere else. But if your looking for a world class hotel with high guest service levels this hotel will not disappoint. Treat yourself.   Congrats to management and staff. Keep it up.
March 2013,"If I could rate it six, I would!","You will struggle to find better service and attention to detail than at Hotel.   I'm not going to spoilt it for you by telling you all the lovely things they do to delight you but you will not be dissapointed. Really personal memorable touches that we have not experienced anywhere.  Are well travelled, always 5 star hotels - few can compare.  There the many nice things Lauren and the team did to make our anniversary special but the 2 stand out items were.... 1. The special turndown, soooo romantic. I'm not saying anything as the surprise was everything. 2. Lauren knew that we had left our son at home for our special night.  When we checked out, she gave us a beautiful bag of sweeties and chocolates all tied with red ribbons.   Thank you Hotel 41, we hope to see you again soon"
January 2013,Service above and beyond,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hotel 41.  The service was exceptional, and the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome.  Nicole in particular was very helpful with recommendations and advise, and was even able to locate tickets to a sold out show.  I will recommend this hotel to all of my family and friends."
January 2013,Something a little extra special...,"This was a little bit of time away from the life of being mummy and daddy. A midweek overnight stay in London to see Mathew Bourne's Sleeping Beauty, as a Christmas treat for my wife. Hotel 41 has a great location (opposite the Royal Mews) and is only a few minutes stroll from Victoria. The hotel is right next door to The Rubens, its sister hotel (it's actually the 5th floor of The Rubens that has been made up into a small boutique, exec club-style hotel) and you're greeted by a concierge in the small discreet downstairs lobby. I arrived before my wife, as she works in central London, and tried to check in. As my wife had made the arrangements I had little or no details with me. Unfortunately there was no record of our booking (unkown as to where the blame lies) however the‚Ä¶"
January 2013,Just... AMAZING!!,Maybe the best hotel i ever been!!!! I traveled here in the start of January for business with my company and i really loved this place!! Its a bit expensive for me but who cares... my company paid and i am glad i experienced the beauty and comfort of this hotel!! The rooms and the service are beyond any expectation!! Totally recommended to all!!!
January 2013,Service ...exceptional,I had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41.  The staff could be the best trained in terms of customer service I've seen in a long time.  They secured all my site seeing visits with detailed printouts as well as handling all the phone calls and set up all my reservations.  Never once did anyone appear impatient ... first class and above and beyond.  Superb.
January 2013,This is how to do special!,"Whether its because of the personal attention of the staff, the very highest quality of furnishings, food and drink this truly is a wonderful hotel experience. Nothing is to much trouble for this top team and I would like to thank each and every one of them for making my wife's 50th birthday treat this weekend so memorable. "
January 2013,Amongst the best hotels in the world,"We have just returned from another visit to Hotel 41. Often whenever you have a good expierience initially and you go back somewhere you have very special memories of, you can feel its not quite as good as you remember. We certainly did not have that feeling going back to Hotel 41. If anything our expectations were surpassed which was extremely difficult considering how good it was the first time. Many of your reviewers comment of the luxury and the attention to detail and 41 has all of those things but staying gives you so much more. We feel we are welcomed back as friends and not in an over the top way but in a genuine, we really care you have come back, way. Our words cannot do this hotel justice, absolutely first class in every way."
January 2013,THE QUINTESSENTIAL HOME FROM HOME,"If you are looking for an intimate home from home experience this hotel is at the top of my list.  My wife and I both spent 3nights at this superb establishment within a week of each other this January and were unanimous in our delight. Quite simply this small delightful 5 star residence sets out to provide a luxurious, and intimate environment and succeeds admirably having paid attention to every little detail. Wonderful liveried staff provided exacting service by anticipating my needs and rendering help in a thoughtful and totally unpretentious way. Welcomed on an a freezing January day with a glass of good French champagne in front of a fire in a comfortable finely appointed reception and lounge area, I was escorted to my room to be carefully given the details of the‚Ä¶"
January 2013,Attention to Detail and service - second to none!,A gorgeous little gem of a hotel - Service was absolutely impeccable and such a refreshing change for London. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. My husband and I were made to feel like royalty rather than paying guests. I won't go into detail about all the thoughtful little touches in the bedroom or plunder the pantry etc. as it has all been said before on trip advisor. It is however all completely true and the many 5 star reviews thoroughly deserved. If you are thinking of booking this hotel don't think about it just do it - you will not be left disappointed.
January 2013,star manager and customer service team,"There are not enough stars in the Tripadvisor rating system to express the excellent customer service that I received at this hotel during a recent stay.  I‚Äôve stayed at many great hotels all over the world (Shangri-La, Raffles, The Four Seasons, Monasterio, etc.) but have never, ever experienced this level of care and customer service excellence. Right after you book, the hotel sends you a questionnaire, in which you can request a special pillow from a very extensive menu (e.g., foam/feather, aromatherapy, triangular?, many others), book spa treatments, make restaurant reservations, and make other requests (e.g., a free yoga mat and DVD, an exercise bike brought to your room!).  I asked for the yoga mat and DVD and for the bike, and both were waiting for me when I arrived. ‚Ä¶"
December 2012,Tailor made 30th birthday treat - brilliant,"I wanted to organise a treat for my boyfriends 30th in January and started planning in November. Hotel 41 were brilliant, especially Monika who helped me decide on what treats I wanted in the room especially the more demanding ones such as 'please find me a room with a TV near the bed' and 'i want these dvd's in the room, can you find them?'. Completely accommodating with no fuss. Offered lovely romantic treats that was still within my budget.  Dinner was excellent and we ate in the lounge -  a lovely cosy lounge, wall to ceiling with books, dark wood and a fireplace. Honesty bar, complimentary sweets and ice cream...  GOrgeous cosy rooms, remote controlled fireplaces and excellent staff. Can't fault it at all.  If you're looing for opulence and grandeur, ornate decor and fancy‚Ä¶"
January 2013,Blissful as always,"I've stayed here before and it's a delightful oasis of calm in a busy noisy city.  I continue to be impressed by the little touches - such as coming in to have a lovely warm lit fire on a freezing cold night and hot water bottles in the beds! I was staying with my mum and she was over the moon about that, plus the fact the slippers were in His & Hers bags, but because they knew it was myself and my mum they put in two Hers instead - it's just so thoughtful.  The staff as always are super-attentive and really pleasant, genuinely nice people and lovely to chat to.  Lauren the Resident Manager had a lovely natter to us over breakfast and made sure we had absolutely everything we needed - we couldn't think of anything to make it a better stay. Thanks to Lauren and everyone working‚Ä¶"
January 2013,Excellent experience!,"My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in January of 2013.  As it was our first visit to London, we could not have chosen a better place to stay.  We arrived early from our flight from the U.S. and they met us so graciously and immediately put us in a temporary room until our room was ready (less than one hour).  The Staff from the receptionist to the concierge, the waiters and waitresses could not have been more friendly and helpful.  Our stay at Hotel 41 was so great! We would highly recommend this Hotel.  Mr and Mrs Scott Santa Fe, New Mexico"
February 2013,every service detail spot on- BUT needs an interior designer,"management has this team so focused on customer satisfaction its quite something to witness.  you'll read many reviews that expound on it.  however, overall interior design is amateurish, reminiscent of a mid-priced Victorian hotel from 20 years ago.  frumpy printed carpet in the lobby, heavy Victorian furnishings, and although there are windows you'll never be drawn to look out of them they're buried somewhere under all those window coverings and behind over-sized furniture.  flat screen tvs in an armoire ? what year is this?  too much furniture in general in the rooms and so many directories you can't work at the desk.  i never did see what was outside my small window, it was covered with a sheer-yes i said sheer-, a very heavy Roman shade, AND curtains.  i knew there were‚Ä¶"
January 2013,Best Hotel in London !!,"I have been fortunate enough to stay in some of the best hotels in London but Hotel 41 is in a class of its own. A wonderful hotel, with delightful staff and many individual touches that really set itself apart from others in the 5 star category. I felt totally relaxed and enjoyed every moment of my stay. There were so many little details that made it so special,  the complimentary glass of champagne at check in, the hot water bottle in bed, free icecream and bottles of water and plunder the pantry (a lovely array of snacks available in the lounge all day long) The lounge is the real hub of the hotel, a beautiful room where you breakfast, have afternoon tea, enjoy evening cocktails and canapes.

January 2013,No way!,So...if this hotel does not meet your expectations...you need to stay home! Every detail is looked after and more. I think the rest of the reviews say it all. Best of the best :-) and make sure to let them do turndown service. Lots of nice surprises there. 
December 2012,Lauren's the best. But so are all the other staff.,"What to say? The best hotel in London and possibly the world. Boutique-heaven and lovely, charming staff. Can't wait to get back to this little gem. Note that they do seem to have one room with a slightly lower-than-expected ceiling. If you get that particular room, ask for a different one."
January 2013,Beyond Expectations,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 in December of 2012.  From the moment we walked in the door, we received the best service.  The staff is small, but after a few days you feel like they're family.  I knew all of their names by the time we left, and they always knew my name.  I looked forward to unwinding in the beautiful Executive Lounge after long days of sightseeing.  Anything we asked of them was delivered.  My flat iron bit the dust in Paris, and I happened to mention it to them.  They actually had one in the hotel I was able to use.  The turn down service with rose petals and candles all over the room was such a treat to come home to on our first night.  I cannot compliment the staff, service or hotel enough.  I will say for those of you who have to run each day like my‚Ä¶"
January 2013,Amazing hidden gem,"We were met with a warm welcome at hotel 41, 2 glasses of champagne and nibbles whilst waiting for our room. We were upgraded to a king size room which was lovely with fire and fireplace, fully stocked mini bar, tv and tea and coffee making facilities. Bathroom had many little extras, large bath with overhead shower and separate shower aswell. Loved the complimentary choccies too! We'd definitely stay again we were made to feel so welcome and special!"
January 2013,Once again our expectations are met,"Hotel 41 once again delivered ourstanding service, superb accommodation  and excellent food in the Executive Lounge for breakfast and for dinner in The Library of their sister hotel next door. Bedrooms and bathrooms are of a high quality and all staff most attentive and helpful. Look forward to our next visit."
January 2013,excellent hotel,"We fully enjoyed the ""English club"" aspect;service is excellent.The room was very well equipped,though a little small for the cost. The shower door did not close properly and the shower system(with enormous water pressure) would certainly require being changed. So excellent,but not perfect...."
July 2012,As good as the last time,I agree with a previous reviewer - rarely is something/somewhere as good as the first experience (a one night stay for my birthday) but Hotel 41 did not disappoint. My husband and I had originally booked a two night stay for his birthday but unfortunately had to cancel the first night due to the weather conditions. However we made it for the second night and like other returning guests were greeted like old friends by the staff. Somehow they manage to make you feel special without it feeling creepy. Everyone seems to be smiling at Hotel 41 from the staff to the other guests. It may not be the most luxurious hotel in London (and I have no personal frame of reference) but maybe that is part of its charm. It is luxurious enough but without making you feel out of your depth and‚Ä¶
February 2013,First Class all the way!,"I chose this hotel after reading many reviews on TripAdvisor and they were spot on!  We stayed 2 nights here after a cruise before flying home and it was the perfect choice.  Right at check in we were greeted and treated to a beverage of our choice and seated at the desk to receive our room.  When we asked about a restaurant within walking distance they pointed us to the one right next door and the Hotel Manager even called ahead to treat us to a glass of champagne before dinner!    Location was ideal for us, it's directly across the street and one block down to the entrance of Buckingham Palace which we were able to tour due to the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.    Our room was beautiful, we couldn't have been more pleased. We will definitely return!"
March 2013,Hotel 41,"My family (husband and three children) stayed in one of the suites in eary February. The staff were wonderful, very attentive  - couldn't do enough for us . The suite was a bit cramped with the five of us but still fabulous, with a huge, extremely comfy, king size bed and 2 sofa beds which weren't so comfortable.The location was perfect, food was fabulous and the kids enjoyed 'raiding the pantry' most nights. A big thank you to Lauren and her team who made our London experience extremely enjoyable."
April 2012,"Privacy, comfort and style","COnveniently located close to Victoria Station, perfect if you flew in at Gatewick and if you enjoy some early morning jogging around St.James and Buckingham Palace. Beautiful rooms and delicious breakfast in a stilish environment. Excellent staff. Quality has its price, but it is good value for your money."
November 2012,too popular. for good reason!,"my husband and i stayed here almost 2 years ago. we get regular red carnation e mail and thought let's stay again this weekend.  (we are from los angeles, live in paris and travel to england several times a year for various events). this time, we will be attending a concert at the royal opera house and this hotel is close enough, but far enough from the craziness of covent garden to be convenient. but now that the 41 is ranked 1 on trip advisor, it is way too popular for us to book/afford!  (we will let you know where we end up staying  this weekend....  i'm certain it will end up at the top of the list, again...)  the 41 reputation is well deserved.  we have stayed at many 5 star hotels in london but we really liked this exceptional small hotel and wanted to return..."
February 2013,spent last 4 nights of our honeymoon at 41...treated like the royal family!,Had stayed at Rubens at the Palace many years ago but wanted something a little more special for the last 4 days of our honeymoon on our way back to the States from Africa. We were tired from travel and arrived late in the evening. We had to wait a bit in the downstairs lobby but finally made it upstairs to the Executive Lounge where we were warmly welcomed and treated to champagne as we checked in. We were given a full tour of our room which ended up being quite small and had some plumbing issues. They didn't have any other large-size rooms to move us to that evening so allowed us access to a nearby small room for use of the bathroom and then officially switched us to a larger junior-suite type room the following day for the remainder of our stay. They handed the entire move‚Ä¶
March 2013,Best Hotel in London,My new favorite Hotel in London. We used to stay at Claridge's but thought would try something different. We are so pleased that we did. Lauren was amazing and really made us feel very welcome. My only complaint would be that the room was a little on the small side. The Executive Lounge is amazing as was the breakfast. Definitely deserves its number 1 status.
March 2013,A great experience,"We loved it here. The service can be a bit overpowering - staff seem to outnumber guests. The executive lounge is a home from home, and we used it rather than the somewhat pokey room. Good location near Buckingham Palace, and good use of the Rubens Hotel facilities. Definitely recommended, one of the best hotels in London."
January 2013,Fantastic service and location,"Staying at the 41 Hotel is an amazing experience. From the moment the door was opened for we have been pampered in a trully fantastic way. The location, rooms and facilities are outstanding. If you ever want to experience what true hospitality is al about you should come over to the lovely hidden gem opposite Buckingham Palace"
December 2012,Best Hotel I have ever stayed in London,"The words, professional come to mind as do comfortable, exclusive, well thought out, excellent breakfast, comfortable rooms that are well stocked of all those little things that make a trip just a little more special. Service was excellent with lots of people to customer ratio. I had breakfast there twice and some snacks both excellent quality with high service levels. The free ice cream was a nice touch even though it was cold outside we could not resist. We asked for Transport from airports as I was also on business and this was handled professionally as well. A great hotel to stay in London for business or pleasure. I have paid a lot more in other places and got much much less.   What did they get wrong, only one thing, after Check out I got charged for food that we could not‚Ä¶"
December 2012,An unforgettable stay,"Myself and my husband stayed at Hotel 41 over the festive period. I would just like to say...this hotel is wonderful. The attention to detail is unbelievable. Before I had even finished my last sip of champagne, a fresh ice cold glass had been offered to me. I never had to lift a finger, anything you could possibly want was already there before you had even thought of it. I particularly liked the 'whatever whenever' button on the telephone which was an excellent touch.  The staff were fantastic and really took the time to get to know you. The girls in the lobby were extremely helpful. Amanda arranged our whole evening for us and booked us a table at Santinis which was delicious (would also recommend). The whole style of service and decor of the hotel was exactly what we were‚Ä¶"
January 2013,Perhaps i read too much on trip advisor!,Overall a pleasant 2 night stay but perhaps reading so many glowing reports left me a little disappointed.  No birthday cake for my husband as like so many other reviewers. No romantic turndown as stated on my third party reservation form. The staff are a credit to the hotel. The setting perfect to explore central London but in this case trip advisor may have been their downfall. 
December 2012,Lost for words,"I booked this hotel for one night for my partners 24th birthday.  words can not describe how much the staff do for you here, they made my partners birthday the best!   we was upgraded to a split level suite! lost for words! the room was lovely! after we arrived back from dinner we entered our room to find the lights dimmed with music playing rose petals up the stairs and a plate filled with chocolate covered strawberries with happy birthday written on it.  In this hotel nothing is a problem the staff will do anything to make your stay as comfortable as possible, you feel so at home here!  the plunder the pantry is a lovely idea your free to get yourself a late snack or pot of ice cream, another example of how at home they make you feel here!  will definitely be back for future‚Ä¶"
December 2012,Truly a 5 star boutique hotel in London!,"We stayed at Hotel 41 over the New years Eve Holiday (12/29-1/2/2013) and from the our first step into the hotel until we left everything was superb and service was impeccable! Although you enter on the street level the hotel is really all on the 5th floor. We were instantly greeted by staff and then the assisatnt manager came down to greet us and take us up to the 5th floor where the executive lounge and the hotel rooms are all located. We arrived at 11:30AM on saturday morning (overnight trip from USA). Our room was not ready as we expected since it was only 11:30AM. However Monica , the assistant manager, offered us a ""temporary"" room where we could shower and relax until our junior suite was ready. This was completely unepxected but we gladly accepted the offer. They did not‚Ä¶"
July 2012,I AM STARTING TO LIKE LONDON,"I usually do not like London but when I stayed at the Hotel 41 the first time my perspective changed. I love the traditional English hospitality combined with the top notch service. Hotel 41 makes you feel you are at a country club with fabulous staff. The location is also very convenient - right next to Hyde Park, you can get around easily. I have been back to London a few times and made sure to come back to Hotel 41."
January 2013,Excellent,"Spent two nights here and found it to be a wonderful place to stay. The staff are exceptionally helpful and friendly, as well as being very proud of where they work which indeed they should be. Well worth making Hotel 41 a place to visit for that special weekend."
December 2012,A Christmas treat!,"This was our second time at 41 and it was every bit as good as the first.  We stayed for 4 nights over Christmas as a treat for our wedding anniversary.  On arrival we were sad to hear that Frederic had left,  but Monika, Lauren and the rest of the team made us feel at home immediately. It's a special place to stay, everyone is so friendly and the location is great to explore London.  Anything you need is catered for, even down to the choice of music in the lounge when we'd had a bit too much Michael Buble!!  We had a wonderful, relaxing Christmas and will definitely be back again!"
December 2012,What a treat,"Stayed at 41 between Christmas and New Year's Day.  The hotel was wonderful!  The location perfect.  The staff could not have made our stay any less stressful, and planned every outing with care.  On New Year's Eve we saw Mama Mia, and Lauren suggested that they arrange transportation via private car back to the hotel.  We thought that might be unnecessary.  How hard could it be?  Turns out it was very necessary, as central London was CLOSED, and the car and driver made getting through what was essentially a blocked off area a piece of cake.  Nice work.  A small gem of a retreat in a very large city proved to be our hideaway.  We'd go back in a second."
March 2013,Outstanding experience!,"Just returned from my stay at Hotel 41, and am wishing I'd stayed longer! I found Hotel 41 on here by accident whilst browsing for a hotel on Park lane, I saw the reviews and couldn't quite believe how highly it was recommended, and at a price similar, if not cheaper than other hotels in the area.   As soon as I arrived I was taken aback by the service, I've never known anything like it! From checking in to showing me to my room the attention to detail was amazing. I had to dash out early on to go to an event at park lane, but when I arrived back I was pleasantly surprised to find a hot water bottle warming my bed accompanied by music and refreshments! The room was of course amazing, I was in a king size suite I believe, and it was immaculate with a huge comfy bed and awesome‚Ä¶"
March 2012,Hotel 41-Fantastic Stay!,"My wife have stayed at 41 before and thouroughly enjoyed it. We stayed on March 2nd 2013 for her 41st birthday( worked well with the Hotel name!)  We have stayed in many many nice 'top end hotels'-Dorchester, 4 seasons etc etc, but Hotel 41 for the experince and service levels is the best we have stayed in.  I cannot speak too highly of Lauren and the entire team who make it their absolute mission to make your stay perfect.   A small and intimate hotel."
December 2012,41 is INCREDIBLE,"Hospitality workers should be required to stay at this gracious hotel before working elsewhere. 41 is 41 Buckingham Palace Road. Yes, THAT Buckingham Palace Road - across the road from the Queen's house. Our room overlooked the Queen's backyard. The service it TOP NOTCH. Wonderful fireplaces. Excellently decorated rooms. If possible, spend a few nights in the Conservatory Master Suite. You will know it is worth every penny when you lie on the bed, hot the remote and the ceiling opens There is nowhere else in London quite like our Conservatory Master Suite. Where else could you sleep in such opulent luxury beneath the twinkling city stars? If you tire of the view, electric blinds turn your split-level suite into a private paradise complete with a HUGE, immaculate marbled bathroom‚Ä¶"
October 2012,A superb hotel and wonderful staff,"So many good things to say about the staff and this hotel. We found the rooms to be well appointed, clean and very nicely finished. The staff made us very welcome and the little extras made our short stay very enjoyable. The hotel had a classy feel with a relaxed atmosphere and I would recommend this hotel to anyone. It's not cheap but worth every penny "
December 2012,BEST HONEYMOON (and hotel) EVER!!!,"Upon arrival at Hotel 41 we were greeted warmly in the lobby with Champagne followed by a greeting by the concierge who escorted us to the exec. lounge to check in. The concierge reviewed a preferences form that was emailed to us 2-3 days prior and which was used to book restaurant reservations and book tickets for a show.  We then were escorted to our rooms for a tour, which to our surprise was upgraded as a compliment because we were on our honeymoon.    In our room were beverages of our liking taken again from the preferences form.  The rooms were very elegant but not overdone and there were small, thoughtful extras for added convenience such as:  a fully stocked desk, dental kits, heated towel racks, and the famous ‚ÄúWhatever Whenever‚Äù button.  When we thought our initial‚Ä¶"
December 2012,The Best Hotel In London,"This hotel is probably the best hotel I have stayed in. Everything is perfect! From the personable service where nothing is too much, to the outstanding decor there is not one thing I would change. What it lacks in facilities (gym, pool, spa) it makes up for in feeling like you are part of an elite members club.  The resident manager Lauren was delightful. Thoroughly recommended. "
December 2012,The best hotel I have ever stayed in,"Warm and friendly staff, excellent service, and personal attention were all combined to make this a really memorable and special stay. I could not recommend this hotel more highly. The staff were willing to help with anything. We stayed in the conservatory suite...a bit pricey, but really really nice, and definitely worth a visit if you are in London for a special occasion."
December 2012,One of the finest hotels I have ever visited,"I want to begin by saying that I own a hotel in Florida. I wish that my establishment could boast of the same exceptionally trained staff as the 41! What absolute pleasure from the moment we arrived. The staff is so remarkably pleasant and helpful. The facility, although lacking in amenities like spas and gyms, is brilliantly appointed. The rooms were clean, spotless, and tastefully decorated. Little things like champaign and turndown service allow this property to be every bit as classy and elegant as a Four Seasons type hotel.  If I were a nicer boss, I would send my staff to the 41 to learn how it feels to be treated like royalty. I will stay at the 41 each time I visit London."
October 2012,Simply wonderful and the best service I've encountered,"I have been instructed by my wife not to put a review on for this hotel as it may restrict our ability to book again next year!  This is a perfect hotel for a short stay in London.  The quality and attentiveness of the staff is exemplary from that first glass of champagne in the library on arrival to a farewell drink even after you've checked out.  The rooms are cosy and well furnished to a very high level.  It is also in a great location, a 5 minute walk from Victoria station and a 15 minute walk from Harrods.  We will definitely try to have our pre-Xmas stay in London here in 2013.  Cost wise it's expensive but not excessively for London and it's still good value."
December 2012,Lovely! I would recommend this hotel to anyone.,"While not the most opulent hotel ever, hotel 41 is one of my favorite hotels in the entire world. It is tiny- but that translates into personalized and attentive service. I truly felt as if the staff was there to assist me with my Every need. For example, when I arrived, I was freaking out because I had just discovered hat my laptop did not have a cd rom drive. Within 5 minutes of checking in, they brought a brand new, loaner laptop to my room (with the requires cd rom).   The rooms were also super cute- each is a compact suite with a fireplace. The bathrooms are also fantastic- I can't remember a hotel with a stronger and hotter shower.   Needless to say, I will definitely return "
December 2012,Excellent!,"We stayed during December for two nights. Great hotel, great stuff, great attention to details!                                                                     Location is ok, not great...but it is what it is. Love the design, the ambiance, the service. Will definitely stay again."
December 2012,Heavenly!,"My partner and I stayed at the glorious Hotel 41 for 3 nights in December and I can't even begin to say how truly wonderful it was.  On arrival the complimentary glass of champagne was very well received. Our room was perfect in every way and the attention to detail is amazing.One of the tests of a good hotel is the ability for me to be able to put on my make up with a decent light,something that is sadly lacking in most hotels but Hotel 41 came up trumps yet again with the perfect mirror and light. Everything, but everything has been thought of with the tiniest detail catered for. On my partner's birthday there was a delicious birthday cake and bottle of champagne awaiting us and the Romantic turn down was just right. We have stayed in hotels all over the world and this is the‚Ä¶"
November 2012,"41, a perfect stay","This has to be my favourite hotel of all time. Fantastic service, beautiful rooms and it feels like home from home.  The staff are just so friendly and helpful with nothing to much trouble.   Owned by the Red Carnation group this hotel is just across the road from Buckingham Palace. If you come to Guernsey try the OGH hotel which they also own and is now the Islands only 5 star accommodation .   Thanks for a lovely stay Vikki and I will be back soon :)"
December 2012,A most excellent stay,"My husband and I stay here in late October and early November for a week on the recommendation of our trusted travel agent. We loved the hotel.  The location was very convenient yet out of much of the London hub bub.  It is very small with all the rooms located on the 5th floor. A very attentive staff always tried to go the extra mile for any requests and always remembered our names and asked after our day. Our package included breakfast in the comfy library/reception area.  It was always delicious.  Food was available in a small area off to the side most times of the day and night as well as a well stocked honor bar. Our room  was extremely well laid out and comfortable, but had no view at all. The bathroom was long and thin with an excellent soaking tub and a stall shower that‚Ä¶"
December 2012,The Unknown Secret in London,"I have been staying at 41 for a number of years on business and vacation. I have found the location excellent with easy access to London being right across from Buckingham Palace and just around the corner to Paddington station. The staff here is excellent and always available to assist with resturant recommendations, reservations and I have found that in between meetings I can work in the 41 lounge, they always remember my name even when it is a few months between my visits. If you are looking for a unique 5 star experience with excellent service in a great location Hotel 41 is an excellent choice. You will not be dissapointed."
October 2012,"Fantastic, friendly intimate","What else can I say, I have never stayed in such a top class hotel that had such a comfortable atmosphere. The staff are the best staff I have ever had the good fortune to meet, they always remembered our names and were truly interested in what we had been doing on our days out and about. We stayed in The Monarch suite and it was nice that it had a seperate living room so I could get up early watch tv and make a cup of tea without disturbing my husband. There is no resturant but they do have a plunder the pantry were they provide snacks ect that are complimentary. I think they change the food 3 times a day, so it was nice to come in from a shopping trip and have scones with jam and cream. There was always what I would consider a good selection, crisps, cold meats fresh fruit,‚Ä¶"
December 2012,great small hotel,"Spent 7 nights here in October '12--small hotel several blocks from Buckingham Palace.  All rooms on the 5th floor--no voew but nice rooms.  The best thing is the staff-absolutely fantastic.  They have large ""lounge"" tha is decorated like a British men's club--breakfast is served there daily with superb service and cooked to order eggs ets.  In the evening (after 8:30) they put out a large buffet of ""snacks""--much food.  There is a person on duty in the lounge 24/7 for making reservations, answering questions etc. Will stay again should we decide to go bak to London."
December 2012,Like no other!,"I have never been one to stay in small, intimate hotels nor relatively obscure branded properties. But, I learned how wrong  and misguided I've been during a most special trip to London.  This I the best place, with the most amazing staff, I have ever stayed. There is no close second.  To have a large, modern equipped room in a small, intimate hotel in London is quite atypical.  To discover such space accompanied by impeccable service from extraordinarily talented, accommodating and beautiful staff, however, makes it even more special and unique.  Hotel 41, with service, quality and comfortable accommodations that surpass expectations, has been so much more than expected that I felt I had to write about it.  Need theater tickets? They'll print them. Need ""tube"" directions?‚Ä¶"
December 2012,Wow!,"I am currently lying on my bed in my room here in Hotel 41 and had to write a review.   This place is fabulous.  Arriving yesterday after a very long week of traveling throughout Europe, I was greeted by a smile and a glass of champagne, then shown to my room which is sizable by European standards and immaculately furnished.  The service here could not be any better.  Everyone is so nice, whether it be for breakfast, lunch, room service, helping me mail something to relatives elsewhere in England, or providing assistance with a business meeting.  This is a very small hotel with only 20 rooms, I believe, so all the staff seem to know me by name even though i haven't seen or talked to all of them previously.  The hotel is ideally located, and has a very discrete entrance.  After‚Ä¶"
August 2012,xmas break with the children,"My  children Eleanor (9) , Charlie (5) and myself arrived late on Saturday evening having travelled down from Lincolnshire.    As indicated in other reviews the greeting was excellent and the immediate interraction with the children was fantastic. This interraction lasted throughout  the stay with every member of staff making them feel special  The room was laid out as requested and they had a couple of gifts for the children in the room  which was a very nice touch.  Also during our stay the a christmas fairy visited again leaving something for the children  The staff are truely brilliant and nothing is too much trouble.    For my family and myself the experience of 41 deservers the Excellent rating across the board.  We will hopefully be returning next year during the school‚Ä¶"
November 2012,Unique hotel,"A unique hotel with few peers. The Hotel 41 is a well-kept hotel and elegant. The rooms are spacious and tastefully furnished. the common areas are very nice, with a style that combines tradition and modernity. Also good breakfast. Good location."
November 2012,Wow. What a great place to stay,"A glass of Laurent Perrier at check in was the start of a wonderful stay. There is not a single thing I could criticise about the hotel. Beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, comfortable bedding and very tasty breakfast. But the best bit of the whole place is the wonderful staff. Everyone we met at the hotel made us feel like royalty. Treat yourself...... Stay at 41"
December 2012,Excellent Stay,"Was in London on an overnight for business- Everything from the service, the room and the location was superb. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is traveling in London and wants the taste of pure luxury. I will stay here again if I am in town for buisness again- thank you to the hotel 41 staff for being such splendid hosts!"
December 2012,"Lovely hotel, excellent location","My husband, daughter and myself stayed at Hotel 41 on Christmas Day. We had a wonderful stay, our king room was spacious and very homely. There was a bath and separate shower cubicle, the water pressure was really good with the deep bath filling in no time at all and the shower extremely powerful. The bathrobe was the most comfortable I have ever worn.  The bed was very comfortable and the round the clock snacks were very welcome :)  The only thing that could be improved upon is the TV, is seems very old and had lines across the screen, it didn't bother us too much though.  The room service menu is extensive, we tried the gnocchi and the chips which were both very good.  As it was our wedding anniversary we received a beautiful cake which was very tasty :) I would highly‚Ä¶"
November 2012,"Wonderful hotel - warm, thoughtful and professional staff","From the moment we arrived the staff looked after us and everything we needed. They remembered what we were doing and even went to great lengths to provide the little finishing touches to ensure our experience was just that much better. They were ready to book tours, get tickets for shows, offer advice for ""how to get to..."" and anything else we needed. Rooms were well appointed and quiet. Location was fantastic. And I have never had better service than at Hotel 41 (and I have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world); and the afternoon tea is worth having (make sure you're hungry). I would have stayed longer if I could   This will definitely be my hotel of choice for all my future visits to London."
December 2012,What an amazing hotel,My wife and I stayed for two nights for our 10 wedding anniversary and from the moment we walked through the doors the amazing customer service began. We were a little early so while we checked in and waited for our room to prepared we were offered a complementary glass on champagne and nibbles. The room was immaculately clean and big enough for the two of us.  We had breakfast both morning and I'd highly recommend the full English.  Overall the hotel and staff were so amazing and really helped make our weekend unforgettable and well deserve they're number 1 status on here! See you next year!!
October 2012,Wonderful service--they really care about their customers,"Outstanding reception, crisp attention to detail, comfortable beds/rooms, and useful sightseeing tips!  My family visited London for the first time and we were so pleased with the hotel location and superb staff.  The Hotel 41 added so much to our overall ""tourist""  experience!  The staff arranged for us to see The Lion King at the Lyceum--excellent balcony seats with a clear view.  All meals we ate at the hotel were served hot and we thought they were delicious.  We were so comfortable that it was hard to leave.  What a restful, warm, and much needed break!"
December 2012,Best service anywhere,"The decor is a little bit like staying in a Winston Churchill museum which is a taste thing, but I'll tell you this - you won't find more attentive, personal service anywhere.  I actually got homesick after leaving this hotel!  It starts with Breakfast in a lovely library-like setting.  This is where it all centers.  The concierge is in the Library.  There are always something interesting to nibble on in the presentation display.  Small refrigerators hold a collection of soft drinks and waters.  Meals are also served there, and I had an awesome steak right next to the fireplace.  This is not an expansive property, there are not a lot of rooms (which is great!) so it is very homey.  They take care of everything."
November 2012,Magical Place,"What an amazing hotel. It is beautifully run and nothing is ever too much for the more than able hotel staff. This is our second visit to this hotel and we will most certainly be back again soon. Where else can you say you were greeted in London with a smile and beautiful glass of champagne on arrival. The rooms although a little on the small side are perfectly situated and you hear nothing from the other rooms at all, which is unusual with most new hotels these days. Bravo to all the staff for another superb stay.... We will be back."
November 2012,Lovely Day in Chelsea,I had a long overnight layover flying through Heathrow so I decided to get a room and picked Hotel 41 based off the reviews.   This is a very quaint property just a block from Victoria Station. I wish I had more time to explore as I hadn't been in London in 25 years. I was able to go out the next day before my flight and walk through Chelsea and the Sloane Square area on a nice but damp fall day.   The hotel staff were very courteous and helpful  and the room was spacious but they did upgrade me to a suite. The suite did seem to have one too many (3) bathrooms for its size but the rooms weren't big enough for anything else. The hallways are narrow and the hotel is a bit of a maze but that adds to the charm for me. It is across the street from the Royal Horse Guards barracks so I‚Ä¶
November 2012,Pure joy,"Stayed at this fantastic property 2 weeks ago, when shopping in London. From the moment you enter a small lobby to check in with a glass of champagne upstairs - they make you feel like you are back home. Black and white theme - very nice. Room was rather small but I was away most of the day. Bed - so comfortable I had problems getting up! Room - spotless. Amenities - delightful. Food - delicious. Service - exceptional. A few names to mention. Monica - very attentive and confident young lady was fun to chat with. Magda - her smile made me feel most welcome everytime I was around. Victoria - very polite and professional. She remembered my favourite way of drinking tea and I was quite impressed! As I could see the hotel was very busy she made me feel like I was the most important‚Ä¶"
September 2012,Paradise in the heart of London,"Simply the best hotel experience of a lifetime of travel. The concept of service, support and loft living works well to make the experience hassle free. Raid the pantry after a long day in London was an anticipated event. The staff was there to make your stay effortless. It cannot be improved on."
October 2012,Best Hotel Experience Ever!,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel 41 in late September 2012.  We traveled from LA to London to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary and booked three nights.  The class of service is unlike any other experience I've ever had at a hotel.  There are only a few dozen rooms in the hotel, which allows the front desk staff to treat each guest as if they were the only guest there.  The staff were friendly, helpful, and would work extremely hard to satisfy whatever need or request my wife and I might have.  We felt like we were leaving friends we had spent time vacationing with when it was time to check out.  It's located in central London, adjacent to the grounds of Buckingham Palace, a short walk to the Victoria tube station, and walking distance to Parliament, Big Ben, and‚Ä¶"
November 2012,What an unexpected surprise,to find such a place in London. Hotel 41 offers everything and more from the super friendly staff upto the amazing service everything is done better then what you expect. For example our little log fire and the splendid breakfast. Next time London I know what to book.
September 2012,Birthday trip,"I stayed here for two nights in 2011. Staying here as a great experience. I remembered that I got a DVD from the lobby one night and a friendly staff brought popcorn to my room later. Great location, elegant decoration, stunning room and friendly staff."
October 2012,Best part of our trip,"After a 5-week trip around Europe, my wife and I decided to change our existing reservation in Notting Hill and go a little luxe for our stay in London. We found 41 absolutely amazing from the staff, the decor, the food and the service - everything was exemplary.   While we had booked most of our tickets and dinner reservations the staff were always more than helpful - even when we extended our stay to 6 nights from the original 3 nights.  Unfortunately we won't be back there anytime soon (we live in Australia) but would recommend it to anyone."
October 2012,"At Your Service,","My husband and I decided to book Hotel 41 after it being suggested from a frequent traveller not realizing this was #1 on TA.  It was our 25th anniversary and so I tried not let the price interfere with making special arrangements.  Prior to our arrival Hotel 41 emailed us to have us fill out a personal preference form...some were no fee and some of the services were at a cost.  The form was not easy to use on the computer and it took a couple of tries to submit it, when I told them about this they had apologized and compensated us with a bottle of champagne on arrival.  We also had rose petals and a chocolate cake in our room. We were spoiled here with the attention...the staff was so friendly and accommodating.  We miss our late nights with Peter!  We missed the executive‚Ä¶"
October 2012,Personal and enjoyable. Well done!,"The 41 Hotel is a great experience. From the reservation process to the check-out procedure we felt very taken care of at all times. I traveled with my two children (7, 10) and my girlfriend.  Check-in which is usually something to forget about was nothing but a pleasure. Hot chocolate was produced in minutes as a welcome drink for the girls. The lobby/lounge is tasteful and very relaxing. A bonus was to be able to spend an hour or two in front of the fireplace in the lounge which that has the resemblance of an old ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù.   My children loved that they could ‚Äúplunder‚Äù the pantry and get  ice cream and fruits and dad loved that it is all complimentary. In the evening there is a selection of cold cuts and cheeses to choose from.    The staff¬¥s just great. Friendly but‚Ä¶"
October 2012,Lovely staff,"This hotel is well located and the staff are very friendly and helpful although sometimes verging on too attentive! The rooms are lovely and comfortable and the first night we returned to find candles in the room and Rose petals on the floor, very romantic.  The rooms are small though. The breakfast was very good, eggs Benedict excellent, although service a little slow the second day."
October 2012,james scurrah reviews Hotel 41,"This hotel offers good value for money, nice old world charm that has been kept up to date the rooms are  great very clean and the staff are super friendly, i would recommend this Hotel to anyone visiting London I hope they maintain standard, they even booked our theater tickets"
October 2012,Excellent!,"A superb hotel with great location. The service is super good, the staff is excellent and it feels very ""friendly"". The staff fixed everything for us, like reservations at restaurans were it's extremly hard to get reservations etc..  I can really recommend this hotel!"
October 2012,Perfection!,"Me and my wife stayed at Hotel 41 for one night on October 27th for our anniversary. Upon arrival we were greeted by very friendly staff and given a glass of Champagne each while we checked in. The Hotel and rooms are amazing. The flowers i had ordered before arriving were in the room along with the note i had asked for. The whole room is of a very high standard and attention has been paid to all the small details. With things like toothbrushes, sewing kits, shoe polish etc. For the evening i had requested a romantic turndown for when we returned from our night out and again it exceeded expectations. We arrived in the room to rose petals scattered throughout the room and in a heart shape on the bed, with Stawberrys covered in chocolate, romantic music playing, Candles, a single‚Ä¶"
November 2012,A world class hotel.,"Having stayed in countless hotels across Europe and US, this hotel stands out from the usual. The customer service was excellent and combination of location, room, cleanliness and food standard was exceptional. This hotel had figured out a business model that works and as long as they can maintain the standards they can expect repeat business. I'll certainly be back. Congratulations to management and staff on a world class hotel experience."
November 2012,Best Hotel in London...........,"I arrived late on a Saturday afternoon. The hotel is situated in a discrete location & I liked that immediately. In the reception room I was greeted by a very attentive staff member tendering to all my needs. I was lead up to the Executive Lounge  for checking in & the customary glass of champagne - perfect start to the evening -   The Executive King Room is clean, spacious & bathroom. What I especially liked was the little touches of when I entered the room, there was a greetings card & chocolates their to greet me.  I was more than happy with the professional staff as they made my experience of Hotel 41, a time to remember.  I look forward to my return to your hotel in 2013"
November 2012,4 Days at the 41 in London,"Hotel 41 is a a quaint hotel with impeccable service and attention to detail. The staff are incredibly friendly, helpful, and professional. Turn down service included chocolates, classical music, and the fireplace on. My only issue was the lack of space in the sleeping area. We were in a junior suite on 2 floors and the desk was right beside the bed. Not only did this make the bedroom area difficult to walk around in, but trying to work while my wife was sleeping was not possible. Certainly not a complaint-but my suggestion would be to move the desk downstairs to the sitting area which would provide more room in the bedroom and would also allow guests to  utilize the downstairs sitting room more. Overall though we were thrilled with our time at the 41 and would highly recommend‚Ä¶"
October 2012,Hidden luxury,"A discrete entrance near Buckingham Palace Road and Victoria St. welcomes you to an exquisite boutique hotel that without a doubt it will be my #1 place of choice from here on out. The room was well designed, the bed was uber comfortable, the room amenities were top-notch and the location convenient to business areas and tourist sites. The availability of complimentary breakfast and snacks in the executive lounge was a welcomed convenience to a weary traveler with days full of business meetings, and the quality of the food was superb. The hotel was quiet, warm, beautiful and welcoming.  Beyond all that, however, the single best part about this lovely hotel was the staff.  Without exception, each was incredibly kind and completely focused on customer satisfaction. You could tell‚Ä¶"
November 2012,Relaxing weekend in fabulous surroundings,"A wonderful stay in this luxurious hotel where nothing is too much trouble. It is well placed being near Buckingham Palace and in easy reach of other interesting places to visit. The resident manager Lauran Hargrave and her team gave us a friendly welcome on arriving in the executive lounge.  Every detail was thought of during our stay, the staff are knowledgeable and showed interest in our activities while in London. The chocolate cake to celebrate my birthday was a very much appreciated example of the effort made to provide a happy weekend for us. The weekend was topped off with a wonderful Champagne tea in the lounge, the pastry chef excelled as usual. Really enjoyable relaxing weekend, a great experience once again and looking forward to returning."
November 2012,Fabulous weekend break..special Birthday,"Myself and my wife have just spent a long weekend at this excellent hotel. The location, decor, comfort and A1 service is by far the best we have received in a long time, in this beautiful city. The staff could not do enough for us. From the minute we arrived we were look after in an Excellent, friendly, and caring way. Top team service from all team members. Thanks for such a great experience and looking forward to visiting again in the new year.  Jeff and Tracy"
November 2012,Possibly the best hotel in England...,"My wonderful new wife and I stayed at Hotel 41 very recently to have a celebratory weekend in London. Having stayed at 41 a number of times previously, the bench had been set in terms of standards/service etc. and it's the true mark of a great hotel that can consistently deliver on this: Hotel 41 does this, without exception.  The staff were exceptional (for example, my wife was unfortunately ill on the Friday night, meaning we had to cancel our dinner reservations at a 'quite hard to book' restaurant. We ended up staying another night at 41 as it really is that good, and the wonderful resident manager Lauren managed to get us a reservation at the same restaurant for Saturday night....no mean feat by any stretch!) There's an unwritten motto at 41 which is unfortunately becoming‚Ä¶"
November 2012,For the Royal Treatment in London stay at Hotel 41!,"We just spent a week in London, staying at the Hotel 41.  From the first contact at arrival to the amenities in our suite and executive lounge, everything was top notch.  The very personal service from all of the staff made us feel truly welcome.  We were always greeted by our name.  We loved relaxing in the executive lounge with our cappuccinos in the morning and pink champagne in the evening.The location enabled us to walk to many attractions and restaurants, which were well recommended by the staff.  It was always nice to come back to our room after dinner to find our bed turned down, the fireplace lit, the sterio quietly playing classical music, candles lit in the bathroom  ... it was all of the little touches that made our experience so great!  We look forward to going back!"
November 2012,Amazing hotel in the heart of London!,"What an amazing hotel. As the other reviews state, the service is unbeatable.  My husband and I stayed here for three nights and weren't ready to leave when we did.  Check In - Complimentary champagne with arrival along with a great overview of the hotel and amenities.  The staff also checks in to see if they can help with any travel planning while you are there. My husband plans everything so we didn't need much help but they helped with transportation and gave a thumbs up to his choices.  Room - We stayed in a junior suite that comprised of two levels.  The lower level was small but comfortable and had a lovely fireplace.  The upstairs had a desk, closet, bedroom and bath.  It wasn't large but was very comfortable.  Attention to detail has been paid to the rooms.  Anything you‚Ä¶"
November 2012,An Hotel yes! But with all the comforts of an English Country Home,"From first contact, through booking, to arrival, attention to detail was exceptional, even to describing where to pull up the car, ""we'll unload sir and park the car for you, congestion charge paid sir?"" (I had done something!). Arrived slightly early, ""please take a seat sir, madam - champagne?"" Very pleasant!  We were courteously shown to our room, the door opened, my wife immediately burst into tears for I had requested the ""Romantically"" package, (see it to believe it.)  A quick change prior to the concierge booked car arriving exact to time, concert and return to a beautifully appointed Lounge offering complimentary self service buffet with a ""honesty tab"" for drinks plus staff on hand offering assistance.  We've all stayed in Hotels where the room phone has 101 extension‚Ä¶"
October 2012,Unsurpassed excellence,"Wow, what a wonderful hotel. Great location, fabulous design and flawless execution.   Location - turn right out of the front door and you are at the gates of Buckingham Palace within 3 minutes. Turn left, across 2 blocks into Victoria St and you have an 8 minute walk to Westminster.   Design - enter the narrow foyer, head for the lift and ascend to Level 5. The hotel takes up the entire top floor with the suites centred around the wonderfully warm and welcoming guest lounge. The top floor location allows for natural light to make its way into the lounge and guest suites via skylights. The black and white decor, against a backdrop of rich, red timbers and antique furnishings, works wonderfully - classy without being over the top.   Execution - 41's stated philosophy is ""no‚Ä¶"
September 2012,"A Good Stay, Not a Perfect One.","We recently stayed 2 nights at 41.  It is located on the 5th floor of the Rubens at the Palace hotel.  We had stayed in the Rubens several times during trips to London and decided to give 41 a go this trip.  We were greeted by the friendly staff on arrival and eventhough we arrived early in the morning we were able to get into our room after just a short wait.  While waiting we were offered a drink of our choice which was a nice touch.  The room was nice and roomy by London standards.  The overall decor is black and white, we had a small window that looked out on an office building and the construction below. We did recieve yummy treats in our room after turndown service but the pillow menu eluded us, which is not that big of a deal.  There were some concerns overall with the‚Ä¶"
October 2012,Wonderful honeymoon stay!,What a wonderful boutique hotel.  Staff was amazing.  Very knowledgeable and eager to please their quests.  No request was too small or too large for them to handle.  Rooms are a bit small but very comfortable and clean.  The lounge is lovely to just sit by the fire and have a drink or read a book. Look forward to staying here again.
October 2012,Another Wonderful Stay,"This was our second stay at the 41 (the first was in December 2011).  The 41 is a wonderful, comfortable, cozy place to stay.  The rooms have an air of understated elegance, with every amenity that  you would need for your stay, including umbrellas, business supplies, a pillow menu (!), access to exercise equipment, and a tasty treat in your room upon arrival.    We were welcomed with a glass of champagne by Freddie, the Resident Manager of the hotel.  He is a genuinely caring person, who remembers past guests and makes sure that every guest feels at home...he and Monika ( the assistant manager, and equally kind) make you feel that you are part of the family, as does the rest of the staff of the hotel.  We recognized many employees from our last trip and they remembered us,‚Ä¶"
October 2012,Fabulous Hotel and Staff,"We thoroughly enjoyed our beautiful, artistic room and the delicious breakfasts and late evening snacks in the lounge.  The hotel staff felt like a cross between family and personal attendants, and we can't say enough about the conviviality and professionalism of the staff. The location was convenient for us, but we would go out of our way to return to this marvelous hotel.  It was perfect in every way."
October 2012,Love this hotel,Staying at 41 always makes me think that this is what it must be like living in that big house just around the corner.  Service is amazing - friendly without being creepy - and you always meet the most interesting people in the executive lounge.  I've stayed there 3 times in the past year and can't wait until I can stay there again.
October 2012,"Lovely central hotel, amazing service","We just stayed 4 nights in the executive king room....which was lovely. I would not get a smaller room .... this was good for the 4 nights we had. The hotel is charming, but made even more so by the staff.  I would describe this as a boutique hotel with personalised service. Staff know your name, and are only very happy to assist. Breakfast both cooked and continental is amazing, best I have ever had....a perfect way to start the day.  The continental offered great options and excellent muesli...which may not seem exciting but it is often hard to find....strawberries, blueberries, all fresh.  There is the executive lounge which is an added bonus...you can call by for cheese or sweets, there is also a full bar, which operates by honesty box. There is a fireplace to sit next to to‚Ä¶"
January 2012,Superb all the way,"Me and my better half stayed at the Hotel 41 for 3nights. And it was superb from beginning till the end. The staff was fantastic from the day we booked the hotel and they contacted us in the days before arrival to be sure that everything was in order. They had superb controll of everything. The transfer from and to Heathrow was as we asked for, we could ask for whatever we wanted and they could fix it ( and they was very quick to fix it), the rooms was exellent and had everything, and the area the hotel are placed is very good with only a short nice walk away from Buckingham and the shopping areas. All in all we have found the hotel we will stay in every time we are visiting London."
September 2012,This place is amazing!!!!!!!!,"As an avid international traveler amongst the Sofitel's, Ritz Carlton's and Four Season's this experience was exceptional.  The service was spot-on and the staff was tremendous.  I would be heartbroken to stay at any other property in London. The staff was gracious and proactive--nigh telepathic--in anticipating our needs: from laundry (pricey; you should know that up front. But crucial, given our situation) to fresh towels, to extraordinary flexibility regarding maid service (I was sleeping in at ridiculous, unpredictable hours!) to cough drops and tea and extra blankets and a thousand other small but much-appreciated kindnesses.  This place is amazing!!!!!!!! had an amazing time there, highly recommend."
October 2012,Exceeded high expectations!,"My wife and I recently took our first trip to London. We were thoroughly impressed with our Hotel 41 experience. The great location was within walking distance of so many must-see sights. The spotless room was by far the most stylish we'd ever seen, and it was loaded with innumerable amenities (e.g., fireplace, heated towel rack, office supplies, etc). Perhaps the most notable feature was the unparalleled level of service. From the charming personnel in the lobby to the attentive servers in the Executive Lounge to the accommodating assistant manager (Monika), all went far above and beyond. There is no question in our minds that when we eventually return for our second visit to London that we will be well-cared for in the tucked-away secret at 41 Buckingham Palace Road! Highly‚Ä¶"
September 2012,A Special Place,"We are Londoners and wanted a special night away together - and 41 delivered all we could have hoped for.  Lovely people, special ambiance, and a sense of being made special - all the time.  We have no hesitation in recommending 41 - we enjoyed our stay there more than perhaps any other hotel."
September 2012,"Yes, this hotel deserves its #1 spot on best hotels in London","It exceeded my expectations, and that is after having read the glowing reviews on Tripadvisor.  Truly wonderful service and you feel pampered. We stayed for 3 nights in September and did the Best of British package. the tea master class was such a fun experience.  They just have all the right touches to make you feel pampered. Worth the price. Central location was great - we walked to most of the sights and places we visited. I could go on and on but I don't want to be redundant from past reviews. You won't be disappointed."
August 2012,FANTASTIC!!!   Nicest Hotel we've ever stayed in!,"It was our first trip to London and I used Tripadvisor for the planning.  Hotel 41 is everything everyone said and MORE!  From the minute we arrived to the minute we left they made us feel special.  We were directly across from the Royal Mews and they made us feel like royalty!  Our room was gorgeous and spotless!  The bed was incredibly comfortable and the pillow menu was so impressive!  Our bathroom was fantastic - 2 Showers!!  We were greeted with a large bowl of strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and raspberries shortly after arrival!  I mentioned that I was gluten free and they actually made 2 separate trays for our tea!  They provided gluten free toast at breakfast - we had egg white omelets every morning which were delicious!  They had a well stocked fridge with‚Ä¶"
July 2012,Unadulterated luxury and the best staff in the world,I could go on all day and night but this is quite simply one of the best hotels you will ever visit in your life. World class service and the most charming staff I have ever met. An amazing experience.
August 2012,excellent staff let down by a very average hotel!!,"This hotel is so over-rated!!  My lady friend and I stayed here for two nights in when we went to go see Madonna at Hyde Park in July of this year.  Briefly, because I do not really like to write bad reviews, I will list the faults of the hotel: breakfast is minimal (a member of staff tried to make me pay extra for porridge!!); you cannot watch the television in your bedroom from your bed; the toilet flushing system in our room broke; the sink plug did not work; the ipod docking station was not user-friendly; the bedroom was barely 4* standard.  This hotel relies heavily on the excellent service provided by the dedicated executive lounge team!!  I repeat, the quality of service is absolutely first class; whereas the hotel itself is 4* at best!!"
September 2012,Beyond Expectations,"LOVE Hotel 41!!  My husband and I cannot say enough positive things about this hotel. We stayed there for 5 nights at the end of August and were so impressed with the amazing service, executive lounge, and great location.  For the price, the inclusion of the executive lounge is a huge bonus; they always have a little something to snack on, complimentary water, and a self-serve, honor system bar.  Just steps from Buckingham Palace and a couple miles from Victoria Station, you can cut through the park and walk over to the shops at Bond Street and other sites of interest.  The staff were amazing! So friendly, always there to help with directions, recommendations, and any little need you may have. For example, I needed a quick manicure before my dinner and I told them I wanted to‚Ä¶"
May 2012,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed just one night at 41 for a wedding anniversary and are now saving for a return visit. We could not fault the hotel, we shared afternoon tea with our daughter and son in law and whilst we were enjoying the tea, easily comparable to The Ritz, the staff were busy turning our already luxurious room into a romantic haven! Our daughter requested the package on the day and at no notice at all the staff added rose petals, flowers, candles, champagne etc, including a personally decorated chocolate confection! It looked magical on our return but the nicest thing was that all the staff knew of our surprise and shared in our enjoyment.Customer service and attention to detail was the best we have ever encountered and because the hotel is small it had such a lovely homely feel.‚Ä¶"
September 2012,Still the best hotel in London,"This hotel simply is our dream hotel in London, we only stay in Boutique hotels and this is arguably one of the best in the world. The rooms are stunning the service impecable. I cant wait to stay again which will be by the end of the year.  We had a problem with our restaurant booking at the Ivy and the hotel arranged a table in the Library restaurant next door, which was lovely everything I could ask for."
October 2011,Like being at home...,"We stayed for three delightful nights and am already looking forward to going back. The ambiance, the staff, the rooms - all superb/top of class. We were originally planning on staying in the Corinthia (which is also a delightful hotel in a great location), but I'm really glad we stayed at the 41. Due to its offering (particularly the size and ""homely"" feel) it is a really unique proposition in London. I really haven't come across anything similar before and will now not be looking to stay anywhere else when in town."
August 2012,"London ""Royal"" Hotel","WOW!!  I truly feel - we know how ""royalty"" is treated in London....for from the minute we walked into this lovely hotel- we all were treated as if we were the only people in the hotel.  The hotel is just beautiful, the rooms and suites are very well done and extremely comfortable - but it is the thoughtful, creative and personable things they do for each guest that makes it such an AMAZING hotel.  It is defintely a hidden gem - and selfishly I hope it will always be that way!! We defintely are planning a return trip to Hotel 41 - soon!!  Enjoy!!!"
July 2012,A Truly Extraordinary Experience,"It is so difficult to express how extraordinary our experience was with Hotel 41 without it sounding hyperbolic, but it is, quite simply, the most incredible hotel at which we have ever had the pleasure to stay.  It is not just a coincidence that the hotel is located just down the street from Buckingham Palace, as you are truly treated as royalty when you are there.  The room  was beyond beautiful, ultra plush and comfortable, pristinely clean and roomy.  The food and drink in the Executive Lounge were five star, but it is the service that makes this property 'sui generis', truly in a category by itself.    Frederic, the manager, has a 'team' working for him that could not have been more attentive, friendly or efficient. Our every single need and desire was met by the staff,‚Ä¶"
August 2012,Our wonderful stay at Hotel 41,"From the moment we arrived at Hotel 41, we were treated like Royalty. From the friendly professional staff to the elegant but comfortable surroundings - nothing was too much trouble. Hotel 41 made our London break an unforgettable experience and we can't wait to return."
August 2012,A Gem In The City of London Not to be Missed,"We had the privilege to stay at Hotel 41 during the Olympic Games.  This is a very unusual time for a property and often hard to meet normal standards as delivery, traffic patterns and security often add challenges.  This was our 11th Olympics and the Hotel, and Staff far exceeded our expectations.  Last Games we were at The Four Seasons and these guys far exceeded that experience.  We will absolutely be back and hope to do business at the hotel too!  Service by Frederic and his team was Gold Medal all the way."
June 2012,Good and cozy hotel,"I stood for one night in Hotel 41. The overall expression - 41 is great and luxury hotel. Perfect service. But two things was not so perfect - the room was not ready and I waited for about an hour (to be honest, it was very comfortable waiting); the temperature knob in the shower was broken and I spend about 10 funny minutes trying to get comfortable water temperature. And the usual thing in almost all hotels - the bed was short for me (I'm 194cm tall)."
August 2012,My Second Splendid Visit In As Many Months,"After having stayed here two months previous, in April, '41' had left a fantastic impression on me, so when I had to come back to London, choosing a hotel was a no brainer. You see, 41 did not only  provide the sheer luxury one would expect from a property of this stature, but moreover, the service provided at this boutique hotel was truly second to none. Indeed, in all their proprieties, it seems that Red Carnation has signaled the one most important factor in creating the finest hotels in the world, and it is the people who work there, for you can have grand lobbies and fabulously appointed rooms, but without spectacular, personal, and even somewhat intimate service, everything amounts to nothing. Yes, 41 is wonderfully appointed. The Executive Lounge is just the right size,‚Ä¶"
July 2012,Rivals the Ritz and Four Seasons here in the states...,"The attention to detail by the staff is second to none.  Frederic, the hotel manager is unbelievable he is there to deliver at your every request.  The hotel only has 28-30rooms and this is great b/c it allows the staff to cater to your every need.   The cleanliness of the hotel is amazing!  Slippers, robes, flowers, classical music, your beverage of choice bedside every evening for you. The executive lounge is a great place to relax, eat great food or enjoy the nightly snacks beverages all included in your stay. Location was great right across street from buckingham palace and the tube station just around the corner 2min walk tops."
July 2012,London for the Olympics and a stay at the Hotel 41,"In July of 2012 we made our reservations for the 2012 Olympic tickets that included a stay in a hotel unknown to us ‚Äì Hotel 41. Looking at the website and especially the Youtube video on their landing page told us we were in for a treat, but nothing we read or saw could prepare us for the wonderful stay we enjoyed. The hotel is located in the shadow of Buckingham Palace, just across the street from the Royal Stables. Hyde Park is a few minutes away on foot as is Green Park and St. jame‚Äôs Park, and of course the changing of the guard at the Palace is even closer.  The hotel is tucked in between the Rubens Hotel and a great little bar ‚Äì the Bbar. All three are part of the Ruebens family and charges can be made at all three and posted to you 41 account. The arrival lobby is small‚Ä¶"
August 2012,STAY AWAY...because I want to make sure I can always stay here,"I've stayed at Hotel 41 several times over the years and never left without feeling relaxed and with a smile. It is pricey but well worth it in my mind. The staff and the ""quaint"" feeling of the hotel make it perfect for travel. Not for the wallet conscious, but ideal for those special times."
July 2012,Royal Treatment,"The staff at 41 is the best. They cater to you in the impressive ""executive lounge"" as though you are a VIP. It is a guilty pleasure that spoils you forever. The attentiveness makes The Ritz look like Motel 6. The location across from the Royal Mews of Buckingham Palace places you within a few minute walk from the Underground at Victoria Station as well as Hyde Park. The room had an understated elegance and I loved how quiet it was. This is the only hotel that I have felt compelled to review... it's that good."
July 2012,Fantastic,"Not much to say, this hotel was the very best and we loved every minute of our stay! The service, the room, the staff were all amazing, we will be back and we would highly recommend it to anyone else! Please message me if you have any questions."
May 2012,Birthday celebration 2012,"Fantastic services at this hotel, if you want five stars stay here as it‚Äôs the best.  We celebrated a 40th Birthday and were treated so well.  Our daughter was made to feel like a princess throughout our stay. Our room service evening meal was amazing.  The staff went to great efforts with candelabra on the table and red rose petals all over, really lovely touch.  We also had a lovely birthday cake and even a gift, very thoughtful.  This hotel is a great location with impeccable service.  We will stay again as often as we can.  Thank you to all."
April 2012,"Well done, 41!","My partner and I enjoy staying in luxury hotels when we travel. To us, the hotel is half the fun of our vacation. So I did A LOT of research before our trip to London. As usual, I looked at all of the large luxury hotels in the area like the Dorchester, the Four Seasons and Claridge‚Äôs which were all enticing but then I started reading all of the reviews on Trip Advisor, raving about the 41. I was skeptical about it living up to all the hype but boy did it!   We stayed five nights at the 41 hotel in May, 2012. We loved every minute of it from the time we checked in to the time we checked out and here‚Äôs why‚Ä¶ Everyone at the 41 seems to truly enjoy their jobs and I mean everyone! The moment we walked into the small lobby we were greeted happily by the receptionist and led upstairs‚Ä¶"
June 2012,Well good!,"My wife and I returned here and this time we stayed in a Junior Suite which was wonderful. Frederique the Manager and Monika the Assistant Manager made our return stay very very comfortable indeed and we loved every minute. This hotel offers such a wonderful experience so different to any other offer available in London and is a really great  place to stay. We had afternoon tea there this time which was very nice indeed and enjoyed the canapes in the early evening, as did our son's who joined us early evening. Location is wonderful and the service offered by all the staff is really first class. Hope to return again for another special occasion."
June 2012,Excellence Personified...with one exception.,"Monica, Remus and Stephan a huge hug and thank-you for the excellent experience!  As an avid international traveler amongst the Sofitel's, Ritz Carlton's and Four Season's this experience was exceptional.  The service was spot-on and the staff was tremendous.  I would be heartbroken to stay at any other property in London.  As every room is different Monica ensured that ""pickier"" tastes were satisfied and proceeded to show me three different rooms that varied in size and views of the city.  We found the perfect room and appreciated the soap menu and pillow menus' which were promptly delivered after ordering.  Although expensive, breakfast was phenomenal.  No comparison and almost worth the 25 pound admission.  Although the bar is well stocked I have a serious problem with Hotel‚Ä¶"
March 2012,Great hotel,"Stayed here few nights with some of my friends and had lovely experience. Very good hotel, clean and tidy cosy rooms,spacious bathrooms, excellent service and helpful staff. The rooms are of a decent size and very well cleaned, sheets were cleaned and towels were changed daily. Highly recommended!"
July 2012,One word...Fabulous!,"By far, Hotel 41 is our favorite hotel EVER! The service is impeccable and the property (location, amenities and rooms) is amazing. We were treated like royalty. The staff could not do enough for us and treated us like we were the only guests in the hotel. Penhaligon's toiletries (my personal favorite) were a nice touch. This hotel is simply top notch luxury!!! We will most definitely be bck soon!"
July 2012,Incredible service,"Can't recommend it highly enough. Nothing is too much trouble, the staff to guest ratio is very high, the Executive Room is a beautiful, lounge, particularly in the winter, with the log fire going, The pantry bar is great, scones and clotted cream all afternoon, penhaligons toiletries and bottles and bottles of it. We stayed in a split level junior suite - great feeling of space, but a bit inconvenient to have to keep walking up and down the stairs to fetch water etc. Probably would not pay the extra next time for the suite, but would stay in  standard double instead. It was very very noisy from the traffic outside, central London location notwitstanding. The bathroom was beautifully finished and the quality of the bed linen superbe. Glass of champagne of arrival, never a‚Ä¶"
July 2012,Amazing service,"The rooms are nice but the best part of this hotel is the service! Every time you go into the executive lounge they are extremely helpful and willing to help in any way they can. We had planned our restaurants beforehand, but if you are not a pre-planner they will be very helpful. The food and drinks in the lounge are also great, an amazing breakfast as well!"
July 2012,A really wonderful experience,"We loved our stay at Hotel 41. Although we were exhausted after our long flight from Australia, we could not resist when they said that it was their tradition to serve Champagne on arrival in their lounge. Even my husband who stays regularly at beautiful hotels loved the intimacy and club-like feel. Breakfast was lovely with a la carte hot food rather than hours old buffet. We loved the plunder the pantry idea, but unfortunately were too busy in London to sit around relaxing in the serene lounge fully enjoying it. The staff were young and fantastic and it was an excellent location."
May 2012,"Excellent service, charming room, great food.","Can't wait to visit here again.. this is my new favorite hotel in London. It's definitely boutique so if you are looking for a big hotel this isn't the place.... but the service is perfect and I love raiding the pantry... the bread basket, cheeses, meats, ice cream...you don't need to go out to dinner!  Location can't be beat either, especially for walking through the parks, Sloane Square, Belgravia and West End."
June 2012,"high expectations, effortlessly surpassed","My wife and I kicked off our honeymoon at Hotel 41 in May this year, and we were looking for something a little bit special given the circumstances.  Having looked at the website, my expectations were set pretty high, and from the second we entered Hotel 41 they were surpassed, and by some way too.   I stay in hotels regularly on business, and have enjoyed some of the UK's well-renowned hotels, but Hotel 41 is in an entirely different league. From the exquisite attention to detail, to the unrivalled levels of personal service, to the quiet, cocooned atmosphere the whole place exudes, this is by far the best hotel I've ever experienced and we will definitely be back. The staff, from the manager, to the chef, to the front of house team could not do enough to make us feel like we‚Ä¶"
June 2012,Second Review,"We were only meant to stay here once on a return trip to London shortly having moved abroad, from London. I think we have stayed here eight or nine times now in a little under three years and I still keep trying to find reasons why we have to go to London. 'What do you mean they are changing the guard again? Best go back then and stay at the 41'.   Wonderful staff. The rooms seem to get better. My best bit? Every time you go there are examples of changes, ever so slight, but nonetheless changes that have been subtly suggested by guests and the hotel staff have listened. Amazing.    My only downside is, being a frequent visitor, the menu doesn't change. I would love to see a revitalised menu. I thank you."
June 2012,Exceptional,"Hotel 41 is truly an exceptional hotel.  It exudes character and charm in a wonderful area of London.  The true masterpiece of the hotel however, is the staff.  My wife and I stayed for 4 nights and could not have been more impressed by every member of the staff.  Whether you are traveling with children, traveling casually, or traveling formally you will be treated as another reviewer noted ""like royalty"".  Would highly recommend this exceptional hotel.  EMD"
June 2012,Fantastic hotel,"Beautiful hotel - stayed for a very short break for anniversary prior to going on holiday. Staff were incredibly helpful and the hotel itself was lovely. Huge bed, very lush bedding and great bathroom. Everything that you would want in a hotel room, with a really impressive level of service."
June 2012,Fabulous Boutique Hotel,"41 is an elegant, intimate boutique hotel, sitting just down the street from Buckingham Palace.  My family just returned from a four night stay there and it exceeded our expectations.  41 occupies the fifth floor of its sister hotel, The Rubens, yet has its own entrance and lobby.  The decor is all black and white, with dark woods and brass, and is very tasteful and beautiful.  We were thrilled that, unlike most every other hotel we contacted in London, 41 was willing to put our three children in one suite.  (Apparently, a maximum of two to a room is the norm in much of Europe, and we were faced with the prospect of having to incur the cost of a third room on top of the already high daily rates resulting from our weak dollar).  My husband and I were in a room next door which had‚Ä¶"
June 2012,Can I live here?,"Can't wait to return.  Staff amazing, rooms comfy, location superb.  Stephan Ott made our stay over the top.  Didn't lift a finger.  Food awesome.  "
June 2012,Awesome!,"My husband and I spent three days at 41 during the Jubilee celebrations in June.  From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty, lots of special touches, ie champagne, flowers, fruit basket and excellent service.  Our room was large and well appointed with a very comfy bed.  Breakfast was a feast with good food and white table cloth service.  The hotel is well situated to walk to all the sights and there were lots of good restaurants close by.  I would highly recommend this property to anyone traveling to London, you will love the staff they work very hard to make your visit special."
May 2012,Perfect London Hotel if you want service and pampering,"Hotel 41 is simply divine. But it‚Äôs not the fabulous rooms, the amazing Executive Lounge, the exclusivity of it that makes this hotel simply stunning. It‚Äôs the level of service almost unparalleled in any other London Hotel that makes this place exceptional.  We came to Hotel 41 for 10 days for the Diamond Jubilee celebrations and for London in general. We wanted luxury, pampering and a great location. Hotel 41 is right across the road from Buckingham Palace, and about one block from Victoria tube station. Check-in was smooth and professional, and it started the way it went for the whole of our stay ‚Äì everyone knew our name and we were never anonymous. We were treated professionally but with personal attention and always with a smile. Perfect.  First the rooms. We had a Junior‚Ä¶"
June 2012,A great experience !,"I chose this hotel for a trip to London to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday having done a fair amount of research on the internet. From the moment we arrived we were very well treated by the team, in particular Magdalena, who ensured we had all the necessary information for our stay.  When we arrived we were handed a glass of Champagne as we registered. The room itself was very comfortable and had real character. Nothing was too much trouble and for us the level of service struck just the right balance. We are now looking forward to booking a return visit later in the year !"
March 2012,"Sorry, rip off.","I booked this hotel on Costco Travel.  It sounded too good to be true.  This is NOT a five star hotel by any stretch of the imagination.  It is a wanna-be.  The restaurant part of the package is horrid in the library at Ruebens. Hotel 41 is only the 5th floor next to the Reuben's and the floor above us was very noisy with kids and lots of creaks and cracks.  Save your money for a real five star.  I would give this 3 star at best.  The wifi is intermittent and the free drinks and appetizers at cocktail hour does not include any alcohol.  This package is fine for the non experienced traveler, but all others find somewhere else as you will be happier.  The staff here was friendly but too intrusive.  Read the fine print.  Sorry for the lousy review but let others be forewarned.  As‚Ä¶"
July 2012,Most memorable stay,"My wife and I staed at 41 in March 2012 and had a wonderful time. It was our second stay at 41 and at the end of our first stay we said that the service was amazing, the food great but our room was a bit small. Well, on check in at the start of our second stay we were absolutely delighted to find that they had given us a bigger room (with no complaining just a reference in our check out review). We  were treated to the usual amazing service during the  stay but I must confess the topper was on my birthday when without requesting it, the staff gave us the romantic turndown (look it up) without notice and without charge!! I have never stayed at a hotel that has read my mind on what I wanted and did it before I could ask like 41. Iwish all hotels were this amazing. Please stay here‚Ä¶"
July 2012,The difference in the details,"We just stayed two nights with 41. Wonderful experience. We stayed in an executive hospitality suite which had a bed set up for my son in a small room with dining table and a separate bath.  Our room was long and had a dining table, sitting area, two televisions and a nice bathroom.  The staff was phenomenal and called us by name. (thanks Monika and Stefan!). The ""executive lounge"" is a lovely place for breakfast, tea or cocktails.  Location was great- across from Buckingham Palace and lots to eat and drink in the area.  Highly recommend!"
May 2012,Very Cozy,I have visited this hotel many times over the past 11 years. I do not the fact the hotel only has a small amount of guest rooms and the ambiance of the library/lounge. The service is good and local knowledge in this property is okay.Guest rooms are a little small. The overall package however is one that is very good you will feel more like a house guest than a hotel guest. Privacy is quite good as it is tucked away from all the noisy  tourists. I would definitely suggest this property for those going to London on business or pleasure.
July 2012,THE BEST - MUST GO,I had a wonderful trip to London - I am a bit of a Hotel snob as I travel for buisness and what I liked most was i didnt feel as if I were in a Hotel - Very warm and cozy feeling.  Service was excellent.  The plunder the pantry was a bit fancy for my taste - Some American Junk food would be nice - for those of us that do not have such a gourmet palate.  They arranged for a car to pick us up and that was nice - and saved time.  Loved the bed (I have a bad back).  Zillions of amenities in the room.  It was fun just searching the room and finding little things everywhere. I kept the hotel room key - and have a laugh and smile everytime I see it in my wallet - I think I will keep it forever as a reminder of an excellent trip....be prepared to spend some $$$$ but worth it
July 2012,wow wow wow,"What a wonderful place this is. My partner and I attended the Madonna concert and as a surprise I booked this amazing hotel for the night...and wish it was for the week. From the moment we arrived we were attended to with a wonderful, warm and friendly greeting. All the staff are so professional yet approachable and kind. A special mention to Fredrique..a man who clearly knows how to make you feel at ease and special. Thank you Fredrique. The Hotel..Stunning..wonderful decor, attention to detail (as were the staff) The room..the phone has a 'whenever, whatever' button with those exact words on it..I kid you not..and they mean exactly that.  The bed was so comfortable..the bathroom was gorgeous with a great selection of creams and potions. 5 mins into our stay we had a knock on‚Ä¶"
July 2012,Best Hotel in the UK,"This is the first time I've written a review on tripadvisor but wanted to share our experience because we were so impressed. Me and my boyfriend have just come back from a short trip to London where we stopped at Hotel 41 and have never been so sad to leave a hotel. From the moment we arrived we were treat like royalty. The staff go above and beyond to make your stay exceptional and the hotel itself is amazing. Stay here, you will not be disappointed!!!"
July 2012,Truly a special place!,"Every business is about people and the staff at the Hotel 41 is simply amazing.  I cannot remember staying at a hotel anywhere in the world where every single member of the staff from top to bottom was as kind, helpful, polite, and accommodating as the Hotel 41. We came as travelers and we left as friends. The physical property itself is quite comfortable with a common 2 floor room used for meals, relaxing, tea, etc.  Our room was well appointed and updated and the linens were pleasant and comfortable. There is a breakfast buffet out every morning that is quite nice as well as snacks, afternoon tea, and late night food just for the taking. the location worked well for us as we were vacationing and wanted to see the typical tourist destinations. Buckingham Palace is across the‚Ä¶"
May 2012,An Undiscovered Jewel!,"I usually stay at Lanesborough or Dorchester....but because it was SUmmer and close to the Olympics, they were sold out.......I was directed to 41 Hotel as a 5 Star replacement, and I was NOT DISAPPOINTED !!!  This is a sister property to the more well known Reubens Hotel, anmd they share a Bar and Restaurant.....what you get at 41 HOTEL IS ACCESS TO A PRIVATE MANSION, WITH YOUR OWN PRIVATE SUITE !!!  the Executive Lounge is your own private hideaway in London, akin to having your own private apartment.....but without the necessary formality of the other 5 Stars.......if you want to be treated like you are at home in your private Mansion in London, this is for you!!!!! Why buy when you can stay at 41 for a week or two and be pampered like you are the Lord Of The‚Ä¶"
May 2012,Exceptional stay at Hotel 41,"As a frequent traveller on business, I do not dedicate much time to writing hotel reviews. Hotel 41; however, is much more than a hotel. It was an experience. The attention to detail and exceptional staff made me feel more welcome than any other european hotel ever has. This willingness to go the extra mile is what motivated my desire to thank the owners for truly being attentive to their guests and encourage those who haven't yet been guests to visit this rare pearl. I believe that one can understand how wonderful a hotel is when instead of looking forward to returning home, it pinches one's heart to leave."
July 2012,Fantastic,This is someplace i tell you. I felt like a king when i stayed here its amazing. The rooms and the hotel is finished to a very high standard.  This is a dream hotel a little exspensive but well worth it for a treat. I will be returning at somepoint.
May 2012,Royal treatment,If you want to be pampered like royalty search no longer... This is the perfect dream hotel. Everything you can imagine and much more. The best service we`ve already experienced in our lifetime.
May 2012,A wonderful start to our trip,"We started our 3 week holiday in London, at Hotel 41. It was a perfect start to our trip, from the Range Rover transfer from Heathrow, to the champagne at check-in, we felt immediately welcomed. We stayed in the Conservatory Suite, with glass roof, and it was just lovely. We realized, much to our dismay, we had left our large camera behind on the plane. The hotel, particularly Remus, was instrumental in working with Virgin and ultimately getting our camera delivered to the hotel (much to our relief) the next morning.  Prior to our trip, we had asked the hotel to arrange Wicked tickets and had wonderful seats. We enjoyed snacks and wine in the executive lounge each evening, and enjoyed talking to the managers and staff.  The management team was outstanding, and very warm and‚Ä¶"
May 2012,Truly outstanding service,The common theme of most TA reviews is one of great service and this is truly the case. The staff here are exceptionally well trained and managed. They help and anticipate without this ever becoming burdensome. (one example was that they saw that my wife has mobility issues and changed the room they had planned to give us to one which was nearer the executive lounge). The food is good quality and the rooms are well decorated and laid out. I was really looking forward to staying at 41 and this sometimes builds expectations that are not met. I am very pleased to say that this was not the case with Hotel 41. We will be back.....
May 2012,Wow!,"We've had the great fortune to stay at some wonderful hotels in our travels.  We have to say that Hotel 41 takes the award for most personalized service.  The staff is attentive and friendly, every wish a traveler could have is anticipated, and anything you would want to pamper you is available by request if not already provided.  They had me at champagne as we checked in!  It only got better with the water, chocolates, slippers and linens by the bed at night, not to mention the candles lit in the bathroom.  They arranged tickets for the sites we wanted to visit and arranged transportation to the airport for us.  My husband and I had a wonderful time and will definitely stay here for every trip in London from now on!"
May 2012,Loved it!,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 last week and loved every day spent there. It is centrally located and less than a block from Victoria Station and literally steps away from Buckingham Palace.  From the minute we walked in, we were greeted by friendly staff at their first floor mini-lobby and escorted to check in on the fifth floor. Check in was very easy and straightforward and we were then escorted to our room and we were surprised by complimentary champagne and mini desserts. So lovely!  This was  perfect as my husband and I love anything sweet.   The room itself is small but well appointed-Bose station with ipod/iphone docking, flat screen wall mounted tv in the room & bathroom and free wi-fi. The bed is very comfortable but took up most of the space in the room but it‚Ä¶"
May 2012,Excellence among excellence,I have stayed at many 5 star hotels but this hotel is by far the best among them all. The staff are all about anticipating your needs. They are professional and personable but never intrusive. The attention to detail is incredible and nothing is to much trouble. You are always made to feel welcome and comfortable and the location is so handy to everthing. You are just a 2 minute walk to the undergroung and Buckingham palace is outside your door. I have staryed at many of the leading hotels in London but this hotel surpasses them all. The roomas are immaculate and well finished and the bathroom is generous and spotless. Treat yourself and enjoy all it has to offer.
March 2012,Great Service,We were welcomed like returning customers despite this being our first stay. All the staff were polite and attentive and the room was lovely.
April 2012,Lovely stay,"We've stayed at this hotel for my husband birthday for 2 nights in March. The hotel is situated not even 10 minutes walk. The location is brilliant and it's just next to Buckingham palace. Great for London sightseeing!  The entrance of the hotel can be surprising as it's a small door and a little desk and a corridor. But it didn't bother us.  You are then taken to the main lounge where the check in is done as well as being the breakfast & lounge area. It is beautifully decorated and loads of natural lights. When I've booked the room, I had a choice to pick of several extras. I've decided to go for the high tea. The high tea was lovely and the staff very polite and nice. We've requested an early check-in if possible and when we arrived the room was available.  The hotel is small‚Ä¶"
June 2011,The service in Hotel 41 is very special!!,"The rooms in this hotel are small, but very confortable!! The service is very good and special!!! The breakfast is good. We liked the hotel, but the location isn't the best."
May 2012,Top Notch,Top place. Really good views and food was top notch too. Would recommend to anyone thinking of staying here. Great location too
September 2011,A perfect pocket in London!,"My husband took me to 41 for my Birthday, just lovely! How refreshing to find a hotel which ticks all the boxes, just super to stay somewhere fabulous and to be made to feel we were absolutely welcome too! Monika checked us in with a glass of Champagne, our room was great with all the smashing extras in the bathroom. After the matinee, we returned to our room to find a floating candle glowing away, lights dimmed, music playing and a Birthday cake.. Magical touches! We had a bottle of Veuve in the lounge and along came canap√©s. The following day the sun was still shining, so walked up to The Palace before heading back for breakfast (serve until 1pm on sundays) We enjoyed London, ate at Scotts then back to 41 by 9pm, my husband read the papers, i watched television.. Happy to‚Ä¶"
May 2012,Fails on a value for money basis,"It's like expecting a trip in a Rolls Royce and then being ferried around in a Toyota, even though you've paid Rolls Royce rates.  This place lacks typical hotel infrastructure and must be very cheap to run.  There is little character and atmosphere.  The big trick is how the staff like Monica and Magda are constantly all over you, distracting you from pondering the shortcomings.   In other words, the chauffeur of the Toyota tries to make the trip worthwhile.  You will never find royalty, captains of industry, movie stars or such people staying here - it simply lacks too much to be in their sights. I think that this place is very poor value for money and would find many better alternatives at the price point."
May 2012,Didn't want to leave,"This hotel was the perfect find.  The amenities are excellent, attention to detail impressive, and the service is fabulous.  Everything was so wonderful that we decided to extend our stay at the expense of non refundable travel tickets.  We will definitely be back."
May 2012,Impeccable service,"My wife, daughter, and I spent a brief stay at Hotel 41 during a recent stop over in London.  From the moment we arrived, Frederic, Magda, and the entire staff could not have been more pleasant and helpful.  We have stayed at several 5-star hotels in the past, and as far as service is concerned, I can't say I have ever had better than what we received at Hotel 41.  The building that the hotel is in is over 100 years old.  As you can imagine, the rooms are a bit smaller than newer hotels, but the entire property is very nicely appointed with all the modern conveniences.  We received a complimentary upgrade to a Hospitality Suite with a king bed, and my daughter loved having her own ""room"" with a fold-out couch.  The Executive Lounge is a great place for breakfast or snacks‚Ä¶"
April 2012,Very Nice,"Great service, food, room and location.  Close to the tube, tourist attractions, many restaurants and of course Buckingham Palace."
May 2012,41 Hotel is the Best!,"My wife and I stayed with two nine year old twins, daughter (25) and son (28) this past April. While the London weather was stormy, the staff made our stay perfect. Monika, Victoria and Roman all did a fabulous job and could not have done more to make us all feel welcome and special.  We‚Äôve stayed at most of the big London hotels (Savoy, Four Seasons, Mandarin, Claridge‚Äôs, etc) as well as the smaller boutiques (The Berkley, Blakes, etc), and the 41 Hotel is a gem amongst them. It‚Äôs small, intimate and situated in a perfect location in Mayfair. The rooms were fabulous and well equipped. The Executive lounge reminds us of visiting a friend‚Äôs English country house. But most of all, the staff is exceptional; friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and no task is too large or small, to‚Ä¶"
May 2012,Pure pleasure!,"My third stay at Hotel 41 and it was perfect! Upon check-in in the beautiful library lobby I received a complimentary upgrade to a king size room without asking and a refreshing flute of champagne. The staff was as expected, delightful, attentive, helpful and anticipated my every need-including finding the boutique shop that sold a favorite brand of French clothing :)  The location is suberb and we walked everywhere and were happy to return to a pleasant dinner in front of the fireplace in the library dining area.  The room was comfortable and well-appointed and I awoke rested for another hectic fun-filled day in London.  We'll always stay at Hotel 41.  Kudos to Frederic and his staff for making my trip pure pleasure."
May 2012,We felt like we were a guest in a beautiful home,"This small hotel was our home away from home in London. Thanks Freddie, Madga, Jasmeet and all of the staff at 41 for making my husband's birthday trip so wonderful.The room with the king size bed, food and service was excellent. We will have to come up with some excuse to return to London to stay at this wonderful hotel again."
May 2012,Reality check is in order - this is not the real deal!,"When you‚Äôre top of the pile on a global site like Trip Advisor, you get the privilege of charging premium rates on the basis that people will be willing to pay more for the perception of a superior offering.  That weight of expectation can be a burden and may result in far more thorough analysis than would otherwise be necessary.  In other words, discerning travellers will expect you to deliver.  The overwhelmingly positive reviews persuaded me to stay here for 3 nights.  For just about ¬£400 per night, I was paying the same that could have got me into the Ritz, Savoy, Langham or Claridges.  Was it going to be worth it and what would the experience be like?  First Impressions: There is no entrance area or lobby.  In fact there is nothing but a passage to a lift which takes you up‚Ä¶"
March 2012,My favourite hotel ever,We have just returned from our second stay at 41.  Everything about the hotel is absolutely perfect.  I almost don't want to give them another good review as it'll be impossible to get reservations if everybody finds out how fabulous this place is!
April 2012,justified,"believe all the good reviews! Stayed here for our wedding anniversary and were completely blown away by the service, luxury and location. Frederik and all the staff were beyond brilliant. Cannot think of anything that would improve this hotel apart from the few things I mentioned to Frederik which were rectified immidiately. I you want something special, this is the place to go!"
May 2012,Top of the Line Hotel,"I stayed at Hotel 41 for three nights and it was fabulous.  The room was spacious compared to other Englsh rooms, and the amenities were incredible - everything you would expect and more including a TV in the bathroom, robes, slippers, and a great turndown service.  The lounge was wonderful, an the service was excellent.   The staff was very attentive.  If you decide to stay here, be prepared to be pampered.  The personal attention is a little ""over the top"" compared to soe American hotels and takes some getting used to, but everyone was friendly and courteous to the extreme.  Hotel 41 is within easy walking distance of Buckingham Palace and St James Park, and there are some nice pubs and shops right around the corner.  We were given excellent suggestions for dinner and‚Ä¶"
May 2012,Loved and hated in equal measure,"My husband precisely described my feelings about this hotel when he said ""I loved and hated it in equal measure"".   Hotel 41 has many admirable aspects. Obviously the location is fantastic. The decor is marvellous, with beautiful wall coverings, rich woods and thoughtfully chosen accessories. The bedroom which we stayed in was very well appointed with every need anticipated. We slept soundly in great comfort in the huge bed. I particularly enjoyed the wonderful rain shower. The linens, bathrobes and towels were all of the most luxurious quality. They provide, as frequently mentioned, lots of lovely snacks. We were given a beautiful cake.   Hotel 41 disappointed us with their style of service. I appreciate that this is converse to many other reviews. I really feel that the‚Ä¶"
May 2012,very nice hotel,"We just stayed in Hotel 41 for two nights and enjoyed our stay very much ! The room was big enough (compared to other hotel rooms in London), location is great, people are very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is good!  Nicole and Riccardo"
February 2012,excellent!,"41 Hotel is a small boutique hotel a couple of blocks away from Victoria station and Buckingham Palace. The room size is very good for european standards. Very clean too. The staff is extremely attentive. They were really nice! Breakfast was very good. I think this is a special hotel for couples, very quiet, private and comfortable. I highly recommend it and would certainly stay again."
April 2012,"Hotel 41,London,UK",What a fantastic experience and pleasure to stay at 41.The Staff excelled in every way and by far one of the finest hotels.I travel the world and am yet to find a hotel to match 41.Well done to the Management and staff.Keep up the brilliant service and professionalism.

April 2012,Most Memorable Experience in my 28 Years,As a seasoned traveller I have spent many nights in London's five star hotels.  Having lived in London for the last four years I decided to treat myself to a stay at this wonderful establishment.  In my university years I used to travel through Victoria quite frequently and came across 41 at one point though never really thought about staying then.  Upon arrival at the property which is very well situated with easy access to public transport and an abundant selection of sights and museums(In my eighteen years here I finally made it to see Buckingham Palace).  When you enter the property you are greeted by a warm and friendly member of staff who will let the reception staff know (upstairs on the fifth floor).   Soon you are whisked to the executive lounge (do not let the name‚Ä¶
February 2012,Anniversary,This is a really top notch hotel with excellent service that goes beyond expectations. Very friendly without beeing intrusive. Very stylish with lots of well thought out designs. Worth the money for special occasions. To bad they could not rule over the weather also.
April 2012,Great hotel for Holiday,"Spent 2 nights in London with Hotel 41 was a beautiful time to me. The hotel had a wonderful location (very close to the Buckingham Palace and the St James Park). The stylish and well appointed and exceptionally clean rooms made the hotel really a great place to relax after long journey. There was a pool in the hotel which just made me want to jump into it right away. The staff was so hospitality, friendly, willing to response to any of our requests. The hotel really made me feel that I am at home not in a strange place. Come and stay with the hotel, you will experience the best service ever."
April 2012,Truly exceptional hotel.,"I stayed here for two nights in April. The warm staff makes you feel like you've entered a welcoming club from the moment you first enter the ""hidden"" entry. The library is simply amazing, as is the staff. I think they all knew my name within 20 minutes of arrival. I will definitely return here on my next stop in London. "
March 2012,Old fashioned attention to service,I stayed for one night and found the whole experience excellent. As a regular user of 5 star hotels in London I can safely say this hotel ranks with the best. Small and unusual the whole focus is upon personal service from the moment you arrive through to the moment you leave.
January 2012,very excellent,"I would like to thank Mr Frederic, Dhana, Monika and the other staff for the Great Great Great hospitality and welcoming. I have experienced the fabulous welcoming from the moment I have reserved the room, it was the first time in my hotels experience that such a hotel send me a forum to fell.They asked me about my preference and what I want them to prepare for me. once I arrived to the hotel they took me to the reception and ask me for any thing I would like to have while they sort me out. there where a complimentary snack and Tea in the lounge area for free. the lounge area is very nice and quite and classic. they toke me to the room no. 4114, and the lady has introduced the very nice room in a very nice way. As I was celebrating my 2nd wedding anniversary they have prepared a‚Ä¶"
March 2012,Thank you for a wonderful experience,"If you are prepared to pay for an intimate, cosy, and luxurious experience, Hotel 41 is the place to stay at. We have never felt more welcome and cared for than here. We have tried various hotels in London, and we will definitely return to Hotel 41. We were there for our wedding anniversary, and in the evening we entered our room, which was decorated with rose petals and candle lights all over the place. The staff is efficient, professional and polite; the rooms are wonderful, and the service is excellent."
October 2011,Another pleasant stay at 41,"Stayed here in 2009 after finding it on Tripadvisor as #1 hotel in London. When we decided to go back to London again for a few days in March 2012 our first choice was to come back to 41.  Ideal position to explore both the West End and museums etc.  Service is impeccable.  Staff are all extremely pleasant and helpful - nothing is too much trouble. Beautiful Anniversary cake on arrival, together with a red rose and rose petals on the bed that night (no extra charge!) - all because i mentioned our visit was for our anniversary when booking on the internet. Thoroughly recommended for a special stay. It is no wonder that it is #1 rated hotel in London."
March 2012,Great place to stay,"This is one of the best hotel i stayed in. Everything was just perfect. The room was very clean,tidy , very quiet. The staff was great, good communication , courtesy, empathy. I highly recommend this hotel."
March 2012,Fantastic,"We stay in London a lot, in both large and boutique hotels. Hotel 41 surpasses them all. Not only is the hotel beautiful but the staff couldn't have been more attentive. My only recommendation to the hotel is please invest in larger tv's. My husband and I decided to spend the evening in the hotel which is something we never do because we wanted to make the most of our night at the hotel and the television is rather small for the size of room. But that is the only negative point in what is a truly wonderful hotel"
March 2012,Outstanding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,When looking for a hotel to stay for a short amount of time but with a maximum impact when it comes to attentiveness. This hotel ticked all the boxes for us both.   This trip was our Honeymoon (March 11 - March 14) we were married the day before arriving. Even though I'd read many glowing reviews on here prior to arriving I was still continually amazed as was my Wife at the courteous and friendly staff that made our stay here perfect in every way I cannot praise them highly enough.  We arrived by taxi and were ushered into the quaint downstairs lobby and then quickly relieved of all our luggage. We were taken up the five floors in a lovely golden elevator and shown the way through to the Executive Lounge which immediately brought a wow to my lips. Check in was smooth and quick‚Ä¶
March 2012,What a Fantastic Hotel and Staff,"Stayed for two nights and all I can say is the best hotel we have stayed in bar none, as soon as we arrived from the welcoming member of staff in the front lobby, to the fantastic staff greeting you as you arrive at the reception. Every member of Hotel 41 should be congratulated on their first class attention paid to the guests nothing was too much trouble , what ever you need they are on hand to help you..  Upon arrival you greeted with a welcoming smile and two very nice glasses of champagne (not the cheap stuff either )!!!! the room was ready upon arrival-12 midday, and we was told to take our time until we was ready then taken to our room which had the wow factor!! Open fireplace was on and we were made to feel right at home straight away. Loved the idea of the honesty bar‚Ä¶"
March 2012,Amazing refuge,"Just stayed two nights at this wonderful hotel. First visit, and was skeptical given all the glowing reviews -- but Hotel 41 measured up fully. I won't repeat all the points about service levels, other than to say that I've never felt as relaxed and as at home in a hotel anywhere (and I've traveled a lot). The setting is warm and welcoming and you feel the staff is disappointed if you decline their (frequent) offers to help. A very special place."
February 2012,A wonderful birthday experience,"Stayed here for the third time with my husband in an Executive King room. Everything was perfect.   We brought my husband's mother for a significant birthday weekend and both she and my father in law were enchanted with the place.  The standard of rooms, decor, food, drink, service is just that bit further than you will get in the larger 5 star establishments. You really feel like you matter as a guest here.  Special note to Federic the maitre d' who despite his tender years is the perfect host - nothing is too much trouble, politeness incarnate, no detail escapes his notice.  we will (all) return. many thanks"
February 2012,"Service,service,service. All with charm,warthm and a smile.",I admit this was a lash out for a couple of old Aussie duffers. Rather than the usual impersonal large international hotel we chose this most English of properties. It's an Olde Worlde experience in a remarkable 5th floor boutique hotel. The rooms are beautiful each with its own theme..our was a suite with a fireplace and staircase. Great bathroom with bath and shower. Did I say shower....the best in the world! Hot and great pressure. Lucky it was predicted to rain in London because I used half the cities water in this shower. Wow I've never been so clean.  We had a dinner and afternoon tea in our package. The first was in the restaurant downstairs called the Library. We were knackered and didn't feel like eating...till we sat down. What a meal. It was finished by a bowl of‚Ä¶
February 2012,41 trip,"Outstanding hotel.  the Trip Advisor rating for theis Hotel is SPOT ON   The experience from beginning to end was amazing (even though we incorrectly arrived at the Rubens next door, we were immediately ushered through the ""secret door"" to 41, making you feel like very important guests!) .  Monika and her team seem to have it running perfectly and make you feel like they really do appreciate your business.  As our waitress said in the lounge ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never go hungry in this hotel‚Äù.  The complimentary side is fantastic, service spot on and on time with breakfast in our room which was very tasty.  I hope to be back here on a very regular basis.  We have always rated the Red Carnation Group of hotels and previously favoured the Chesterfield in the West End BUT we will now go to the‚Ä¶"
January 2012,Awesome Experience,"I stayed here for several days while on business in London. The hotel is immaculate and the staff are extremely helpful and courteous. The atmosphere was genuine and not stuffy. The day I was leaving, London was dealing with a major snowstorm to them and the airport was canceling flights etc. I was on my way to Paris on the Eurostar and they spent time calling to verify the trains were going to run and even called a cab to come and pick me up. They also offered to allow me to stay and would even take care of getting new tickets for the Eurostar for the next day if needed. I love the place. The food was excellent , the staff were all excellent. They really do go out of their way to make you feel at home. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to be pampered.."
February 2012,Fabulous service and lovely oasis in great location!,We recently returned from a 3 night stay at Hotel 41.  The service was exceptional. The rooms were beautifully appointed. The highlight was the lounge which was a quiet and clubby respite from the bustle of the city. Freddie and his staff are world class.
August 2011,Perfection,We had a fantastic 2 nights at hotel 41. The staff are very friendly and helpful and made everything very easy for us.
January 2012,Elegance,"The perfect hotel that is well maintained. Good services. The staff very friendly. If you want luxury and confort, you can stay there. Highly recommended."
January 2012,60th Birthday Celebration,"My son and I have just returned from a three night stay at the 41, celebrating my 60th birthday and I can't praise the hotel highly enough. It was wonderful in every way (apart from the television which was rather small and old) from its perfect central location near Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station, the comfort and warmth of its rooms with so many extra personal touches (there was a delicious birthday cake waiting for me on arrival) and, last but not least, the staff. The service is outstanding, very friendly but courteous and extremely personal. Nothing is too much trouble and they always asked after our day when we returned to the hotel. Everyone helped to make our stay and my birthday celebration so very special."
September 2011,Weekend away with daughter for my 60th birthday.,"Fabulous Hotel,lovely staff,felt very safe in a wonderful setting.Buckingham Palace just over the road.Hospitality was second to none.Had the breakfast and the afternoon tea,both were excellant.Stayed in many London Hotels,because my daughter lives there,and I  visit three or four times a year,so we stay in different Hotels,its like a little holiday each visit.This was the best ever,The room was beautiful,many little touchs,chocs,candles,olives,lovely dressing gowns and slippers,the fire was light when we returned from an evening in the lounge and a little trip in the night air.It was a little expensive,but hey what price a lovely memory,you can't put a price on that.Would love to re visit,maybe at Xmas,Thanks again to all the lovely staff,for a lovely Birthday,still eating the‚Ä¶"
July 2011,Very romantic,"We came here for business/romantic trip. We loved this hotel. Staff was very accommodating. They sent us to a great breakfast place around the corner and also arranged a private car for our return to the airport. My husband was working so I checked in alone and I was very early, so they took our bags and I went exploring the area. When I came back everything was ready. Room wasn't big but we enjoyed the cozy feel to it. We had after dinner drinks sent to our room at night which was very romantic. The location is also a plus. Bucking ham palace is barely a block away and the gardens were beautiful to take a nap or people watch."
December 2011,I do get the hype of this hotel.,This is a very personal Hotel with great service.  We felt as though we were a guest not just another number.  When you enter the reception/lounge area it feels like you have entered a different world.  The location is brilliant right next to Buckingham Palace.  It took the stress out of a London visit as we could walk to many places such as Westminster.    You can pay a lot less for hotels in London but id recommend Hotel 41 as its a different experience. Couldnt fault it.
December 2011,DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE,"Stayed four wonderful nights at Hotel 41 in December 2011.  My wife and daughter felt like British Royalty here.  The staff (especially Magdalena and Frederick) went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and welcome.  Probably the best service of any hotel we have stayed at in the world.  Far superior than some of the Peninsula, Waldorf or other Five Star Hotels we have been blessed to enjoy.  I booked the room based on reviews from Tripadvisor.  The price was very high and we thought that there would be no way any hotel is worth this kind of money. We were wrong.  Hotel 41 is worth the price.  Every employee knows your name here.  Every employee addresses you when they see you.  Every employee asks if your require any assistance.  From making restaurant reservations to‚Ä¶"
December 2011,"Hotel 41 London, what a treat!","Having been in the travel industry for many years and been lucky enough to visit some very beautiful hotels, none were as welcoming and hospitable as those at Hotel 41.  An absolute treasure tucked away in a quiet location with great shops and restaurants.  I hope to return with my partner as soon as possible.  Well done to all the staff...."
December 2011,the 41 for ever...,"The best 5 nights ever spent in a hotel. The staff of this hotel, without any exception, give you the best service ever.You are looked after like nowhere else. Their input and commitment are guaranteed to make your stay a success. The hotel decoration is tasteful and pleasant. The location is perfect and as the hotel only has abt. 28 rooms the service has a much more personal approach.Here you are not a number but a guest. As I said to the staff upon getting back at the hotel every day...""it's good to be back home""...because that is how it felt. Here you get more for the money. Centrally located, quiet, and safe as the hotel is located on the 5th floor.  This hotel has an amazing team working together well. No need to look further..if London is the palce to be, then the 41 is‚Ä¶"
December 2011,Totally exceeded our expectations (which were already pretty high!),"We stayed at 41 for our honeymoon and it is a wonderful, special, treat of a place that we will re-visit in the future for our 'special' weekends away. Freddie and his team were brilliant.  A perfect mix of super attentive yet friendly and fun with it. My fiance, now husband had booked it as a secret and I was blown away. The breakfasts were fabulous, my favourite being the eggs royal.  Oh yum yum yum!  Then the Plunder the Pantry at night was a feast in itself. Candles and Rose petals all over the room too.  I just cant speak highly enough about it. We had seen the few bad reviews and can only imagine they were either masd, blind, or in the wrong place!! The worse I can say is the bed was very soft but hey, thats merely my preference, not something wrong with the place.‚Ä¶"
December 2011,Tranquility  in chaos,"Just returned from a 3 day trip. The whole experience was incredible. The team, surroundings, service and professionalism was superb. If you are looking for a very tranquil setting in the heart of busy London, then this is the place."
December 2011,The best we ever had!,"We have been in lots of hotels, also in London, but this was the best we ever had. The decoration of the rooms and the lounge is sophisticated and pleasant. As soon as you walk in, the staff gives you a warm welcome and not only because they have to. You really feel like coming home. They take care of you and they assist you in word and deed, giving you advice about the musea, shops, restaurants etc. Well, we can only speak in superlatives about this hidden secret near Buckingham Palace. We loved every minute of our stay. Surely we 'll go back there next time.  Hans and Alicia Winters, The Netherlands."
December 2011,A Tranquil Oasis,"What a lovely place to stay! As a Londoner, I have seen so many glitzy 5 star hotels. Thankfully, those who want glitz don't come here: Hotel 41 has none of the stuff and nonsense of most of the competition. From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave, you will be aware (but only vaguely) of the amazing personal, professional service with so much attention to detail - like a swan moving on water, all their work is unseen. The relaxed but stylish surroundings, typified by the hotel lounge, is so stylish and restful; a real home from home, if only home were this good!  Mike & Susie."
October 2011,Outstanding and a hotel experience I doubt that will ever be matched!!!,"This hotel is absolutely perfect! Having stayed in London on many occasions and in various 5 star hotels and spa resorts the world over, I have never had an experience or level of service like it! Attention to detail, luxury and the most attentive and friendly staff are but part of the beauty of this hotel. The exquisite and chic decor is outstanding, yet homely and inviting at the same time.  Arriving for a birthday weekend treat, we were immediately greeted by the friendly concierge who offered us a lovely hot coffee while waiting for the manager to whisk us up to the 5th floor paradise. While checking in, we were then asked if we would like a complementary champagne as the staff asked with real interest about our plans for the weekend. At that point we were told if we needed‚Ä¶"
November 2011,Wonderful!,"We loved our stay at 41 Hotel in London. The team was exceptionally attentive, very helpful and had a kind, generous spirit.   Free internet/computer usage was a plus. They also provided ipads to guests who wanted to use them in the privacy of their room. Breakfast was wonderful with a full menu as well as a continental choice.   Service was exceptional.  The hotel felt more like a private club than a hotel.   We stayed for four nights and then returned a few nights later for one additional night before our flight home.  When we returned,  a beautiful bottle of wine, cheese platter and a huge piece of cheesecake with a welcome message was in our room.  The rooms are very comfortable with luxurious sheets, towels and robes.  The best part was that our room was very quiet. A huge‚Ä¶"
December 2011,Excellent service without being stuffy,"My husband chose this hotel because of its high TripAdvisor ranking, and we were not disappointed. We typically would not stay at a top-of-the-list (nor top-of-the-price-range) hotel but we booked this last-minute with the intention of spoiling ourselves a bit. Mission? Accomplished. The staff at Hotel 41 - especially Frederic, Monica, and Remus - literally tripped over themselves to make sure we were taken care of. Everything about the service here was extraordinary and well worth the price. At tea one afternoon, my husband asked if they had chocolate tea, and they regretted they did not. No less than ten minutes later, however, they appeared with chocolate tea, for which they had sent someone down the road to purchase! They booked us amazing seats at two great shows and‚Ä¶"
December 2011,Excellent Service,"The hotel is not the easiest to arrive at if your driving but we drove into the lane behind it and a porter parked our car for us offsite.   We were taken to the executive lounge and made to feel very welcome with complimentary champagne, tea , etc.    Our room was small but packed with everything you might need.  The bed was very comfortable.  Service is the trademark of the hotel and all of the staff work hard to make you feel at home.    Breakfast at ¬£25 was a bit more than I would have expected to pay.  Great hotel in terms of location, brilliant service!  "
December 2011,The best hotel in London*,"*in our opinion anyway!  My husband booked Hotel 41 for a romantic weekend away in December.  He regularly stays in London and has stayed at some of the best, but for him, Hotel 41 gives a truly personal experience, something the larger hotels are unable to provide.  Nothing is too much trouble for Frederic and his team.  Adam personally arranged fantastic seats for us at 'Wicked' and because the hotel has such a lovely feel about it, we decided to eat there rather than going out before the show.  The food was excellent and in the morning you could easily spend a couple of hours enjoying breakfast.  'Plunder the pantry' was perfectly timed when we returned after the show and the 'turndown' was something I have never experienced before.  It seemed like every time we left our room‚Ä¶"
December 2011,A gem of a hotel!,"What's not to love about 41? My partner and I stayed there for two nights from new years eve 2011 and were amazed, neither of us thought you could get such good service. The staff were first rate - polite, sensitive to our needs (and moods!), well informed about London and the local area, extremely helpful and were constantly looking for ways to make our stay perfect. The hotel itself was clean and well kept with beautiful furnishings, furniture and fittings. the rooms were perfect - lovely bathrooms, comfy beds, latest tech in TV's and CD player/radio, splash proof TV in the bathroom! Features wise, whilst we didn't really use a huge number of the amenities we were kept abreast of all they could offer - local gym, pool, spa and so on and everything seemed to be to a very high‚Ä¶"
December 2011,Excellent Boutique Hotel,I stayed at 41 in December and we had an excellent experience.  It was my Dad's 70th birthday and the hotel staff and the beautiful surroundings made it a very special experience for us.  The balance of 5 star professioanlism and informality amongst the staff makes the hotel feel special without it being formal or stuffy. I am staying there again soon and look forward very much to our stay.  Thank you to Remus and all the staff.
December 2011,Great trip during the holidays,"The staff at Hotel 41 are not only extremely helpful and service-oriented.  This much one would certainly expect from a five-star hotel.  But the staff also exude warmth, rather than formality, and they show great skill at learning the interests of the guests.    Typically, my wife and I can be made to feel uncomfortable by high-level service.  We don't want anyone to think that we believe we are any better than anyone else, and often ""five-star"" service creates an ambience that screams, ""You're SUPPOSED to act like you're better than the have-nots!""    Not so at Hotel 41.  From the moment we walked in the door and were greeted by Roman, the staff made us feel at home.  Thanks need to go out to Roman, Julian (great recommendation/reservation for lunch at Quilon!), and the great‚Ä¶"
December 2011,Thanks for a Brilliant Weekend,"Family wanted to stay in London over New Years.   We booked 4 days at Hotel 41 - 2 rooms, so we had a connecting room for the kids.   We really didnt know much about the hotel other than the great write-ups from Trip Advisor.  The write-ups don't do justice to the Hotel.  It was nothing short of amazing.  The staff beats any high end hotel chain (think Four Seasons) with their service and personality.  They knew the kids by name and helped with any request (dinner reservations, tickets to plays, etc).   Would highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting London."
December 2011,Still a brilliant small hotel with exceptional service,"We have just spent the week prior to Christmas at this terrific hotel; just over 4 years since we first stayed here. We were very pleased to find that the exceptional standards we found last time have been maintained. We took an Executive KIng Room which was an excellent size, particularly for London. There is not a lot of point in covering off the points that set this hotel apart from other luxury hotels; they are covered off adequately by many other recent trip advisor reviews.... except to reiterate that the staff are what make the difference, they are simply the best we have found in any hotel anywhere.  We thoroughly recommend ""41"" to anybody wanting a truely exceptional hotel experience without the ""machine"" like feel that you can get from larger establishments."
December 2011,Alchemy has a number...41,"Alchemy's a rare commodity ... but '41' has it.  Hard to define how/why a boutique hotel is quite so outstanding ; exceptional staff  + understated luxury + outstanding attention to detail and quality +  beautiful difference + elegant charm + royal location...all there plus ..honestly...a tiny bit of magic*  We spent a perfect 3 night stay there in December. The chaos of our journey melted within seconds of arriving : the ultimate in discrete effiiciency (Frederick...manager), had conjured a perfect split-level suite, open-fire, candle light, relaxing drinks. Everything happened magically, effortlessly...doors opened, ice-bucket waiting,restaurant tables arranged.   Adam (utter gem) invisibly made sure relaxation happened :stress doesn't exsist there, privacy respected, romance‚Ä¶"
December 2011,A perfect new year,"I made a last minute booking for a surprise trip for a new year gift ,what a gift ,if you want to stay in a hotel in London and want places in walking distance  then this is the place ,they could not do enough for you ,highly recommend the the Full English breakfast, its one to keep you going all day , Staff were great and helpful so thank you to them ,Hotel 41 has every thing for your stay.would definitely stay again ,"
December 2011,Excellent hotel,"Exceptionaland luxurious hotel. You will be amazed of the detailed and excellent service you will get.Nice location, near the Buckingham palace on foot. Nice fireplace."
December 2011,A perfect Christmas stay in London,"My wife and I decided to spend our Christmas in London.  The reviews for ""41"" were spot on.  We signed up for the Christmas package which also included Christmas stockings and afternoon tea, which were both exceptional.  The room was classically British with a modern twist (not at all stuffy).  I liked the wireless Internet, Bose player for my iPhone, and the surround sound system in the room.  The fireplace added a cozy, romantic feel that was so welcoming after a day of sightseeing or a night at the theater. The staff was attentive, polite, and quickly knew our names and personal needs.  The breakfast was superb and filling.  Can't wait to go back! Who's going to turn down my bed tonight?!"
November 2011,Perfect little birthday treat!,"i cannot recommend this hotel enough! the rooms are small but very elegant, they were spotless and full of little luxury items to make sure your stay is nothing but perfect. i requested a ""romantic turn down"" as it was my wife's birthday and i was not dissapointed, very nice touch's were made to our room and i can 100% recommend this to all you fella's out there!  my last comment will be the staff, they were amazing! extremely friendly without being over the top and they actually made our stay and will definitely be the reason that we stay again in the future, they even gave us a bath robe for our 1 year old son who wasn't even with us!  just nice personal touch's that made our stay absolutely perfect!  so a huge thank you to the staff of hotel 41."
October 2011,Love the personal touches.,"A hotel with a difference....cozy, stylish and exceptional staff.  Rooms are small in keeping with London standards but packed with luxury and nice finishing touches.  The room turndown meant we were greeted with a warm welcoming room at the end of the day.  Location just behind Buckingham Palace, and up the road from Victoria Station is just great Expensive YES... But good value when compared to other lux central London hotels."
October 2011,amazing hospitality and luxury,"I stayed here for one night to celebrate an anniversary - when I travel, I tend to spend a pretty  penny for someplace nice for one night, and I would suggest this place to anyone. Completely separate from the Rubens hotel right next door/downstairs (also a Red Carnation property), Hotel 41 is directly across the street from Buckingham Palace. After checking in, we were guided upstairs and informed of the nightly happy hour they held in their private lounge, a beautiful space on the top floor of the building (same floor as our room) with clerestory windows up top and beautiful books everywhere. This is the same space where breakfast was served in the morning.   We stopped by the lounge to chat with the concierge about dinner plans, since it was our anniversary, and they‚Ä¶"
November 2011,A real find.,"Stayed for one night with my wife before flying out to the USA and this was the first night of our special 30th wedding anniversary celebratory trip. We have stayed at a number of the Red Carnation Collection Hotels and this is one of the best. Located in Buckingham Palace road next door to Reubens hotel it is about a twenty minute walk to Picadilly Circus and theatreland.  The Hotel is quiet, clean and extremely comfortable and the staff are just superb. Extremely professional and helpful even assisting us with our internet flight check in. Our room (4121) was beautifully appointed and comfortable and the only minor criticism is that the bathroom was a bit small. Nevertheless you could not ask for a higher standard of furnishing and decor.  Arrival and departure were smooth and‚Ä¶"
December 2011,Incredible luxury boutique hotel!!!!!!!,What more can be said about this hotel then has already been added by Tripadvisor members?!?! We searched for a hotel to stay in for one night (the first of our honeymoon!) before travelling on - we wanted somewhere special that would reflect the occasion and considered a wide range of hotels in the London area. In the end there could be only one - Hotel 41!! This is an amazing hotel where service and standards are taken beyong the 5 star level that is too often banded around to mediocre hotels!! The staff cannot do enough for you in the nicest possible way and made our stay forever memorable! The pictures on the website speal for themselves! I would finish by adding - don't think - just book - it is well worth it!!!!!
December 2011,Purcells,We stayed at this wonderful location on return to London after 11 years. It could not have been more enjoyable. The hotel is perfectly located just behind Buckingham Palace and near to Victoria Station. It is beautifully presented. The staff could not be more welcoming and hospitable. Our compliments to Frederic and Adam and all the staff who were most helpful during our stay. We will return.
December 2011,Long Weekend,"Had the best long weeking in London ever. Stayd here from thursday to sunday and the staff here is amazing.  They get everything you need and mutch more. Will defenitly stay here next time we are in London. Great location, near everything you need in London. Luxary all the way. Thanks for the stay 41"
October 2011,Extremely Romantic Experience!,"We stayed here for one night for a special occasion and wished we could have stayed longer! The service was excellent, the staff were very helpful, we were upgraded and the food was very good with a wide selection for breakfast. We recommend the afternoon tea which was very filling. We had booked the romantic turndown as a surprise which was lovely. Our stay was very peaceful and romantic- just what we were after. In fact we liked it so much we are planning our honeymoon here for next year- Frederic spent time showing us the different rooms so we could see what else was on offer for that. Wonderful hotel that definately deserves its reputation on here."
December 2011,A Truly Special Place,"I can hardly do justice writing about our great experience.  I chose this hotel because of it location, boutique-feel and its outstanding Trip Advisory rating.  I took my son to London to see our beloved Chicago Bears play in Wembley for his 7th birthday.  I was bit worried upon arrival that the hotel was too intimate for a child and our presence might alarm the mainly adult guests who paid handsomely to be away from children.  My worry was wasted as the staff was so incredible with my son, Luke.  Perhaps most impressive was the staffs versatility; they could cater to the whim of an opera going adult couple and then effortlessly shift gears to cater to the much different whims of a 7-year old boy.  Bravo.  The hotel itself is a oasis from the hustle and bustle of touring London.‚Ä¶"
October 2023,Very Nice Hotel,"Stayed here for a night recently and it was very nice. The staff was extremely attentive, helpful, and friendly. The room was very comfortable and well prepared. Location is great as it is very close to Victoria Station which makes it very easy to get around. The only word of caution I would give is that the hot water in the sink and shower is immediately very hot which led to me slightly burning my hands the first time I went to the restroom. It wasn't a problem once I knew it was coming though. Overall I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a very nice hotel in a great area with a very helpful staff."
October 2023,Amazing experience ,"This hotel is literally the best I have ever stayed in. The room left me speechless, it was absolutely beautiful. Immaculately clean and luxurious. The staff were all very warm, friendly and welcoming, they catered to my every need. Nothing was too much trouble.  The chamomile tea is a must. I was sorry to leave and will be staying whenever I return to London.   "
October 2023,It Takes One To Know One:  SUPER!,"I stayed at the Milestone for 6 nights in October 2023 with relatives.  My family is in the hotel business in the U.K., so I can sense a quality establishment within about 90 seconds of walking in the front door.  This hotel and its offerings:  from rooms to cuisine is superb.  Mr. A. Pike, G.M., has one of the most professional, yet warm, staffs whom I have ever encountered.  I am going to miss some names, here, and I apologize in-advance; but shout-outs to:  Tim, Andrei, and Fran at the front; Sophia in the executive office; Messrs. Ahuja and Fraser, Managers; Chakira, Aurela, & Zen, Reception; Leo & Paolo, Dining Room Mgrs. extraordinaire; Dorina & Denis--the wonderful ambassadors of breakfast.  When one works in the hospitality industry, you don't forget names, as you can‚Ä¶"
October 2023,Far exceeded expectations!,"Our stay at the Milestone Hotel in Kensington far exceeded our expectations.  My husband and I came to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  Every member of the staff was unfailingly friendly, welcoming, and helpful.  Our room was extremely comfortable, and I especially appreciated the delicious clotted cream fudge that was frequently left during turndown service, one of many thoughtful and welcoming gestures. The housekeeping staff did a fantastic job, our room was immaculate.  I enjoyed staying at the Milestone possibly more than any hotel I have visited.  We hated to leave."
October 2023,The best of authentic London,"There are so many nice new hotels in London so the Milestone is easily overlooked. We chose it because we like interesting and unique over fancy and this one hits the right spot. It is quintessential British luxury and not just international hotel standard luxury. We have stayed here before and each time was satisfactory so we chose it again for our three week grand European trip. For frequent travelers to London, the location is ideal as you feel like you are in a more real part of London. Knightsbridge, Mayfair and Picadilly are for tourists, but those of us who know London enough love the Kensington area.  The hotel is quirky but exceedingly tasteful. You will definitely not forget it. It also has this very authentic London charm with its narrow corridors, dark nooks and‚Ä¶"
September 2023,A true gem right on the High Street,"Beautiful room in a perfect location across from Kensington Park. Staff were all incredibly helpful, down to the smallest detail.  Two blocks from the Royal Albert Hall.  Though located on the High Street, rooms were very quiet.  Would certainly stay here again."
July 2023,Royal Experience,Our stay was beyond our expectations. The staff were so very kind and thoughtful. Everything was very personalized. Coffee service in our room. Breakfast was perfection. Ate in their bar/pub and was gorgeous. Dinner was amazing. Never experienced this type of gracious accommodations. Highly recommended. 
September 2023,Just wonderful! ,"The Milestone Hotel has a very special place in our hearts. 13 years ago my husband proposed to me in one of the beautiful suites, and when we returned this year for our anniversary and a family wedding in London,  we were blown away when we opened the doors of our room to find it was the exact same suite. All the memories and all the emotion came flooding back and we were made to feel so special and pampered by the wonderful staff and their hospitality at this incredible hotel. Not only is the location fabulous, the beds luxurious and the rooms beautiful designed, it‚Äôs all the personal touches that make this hotel so special. It wasn‚Äôt by luck that we were staying in the same suite we were engaged in, they just knew and surprised us.  We loved the flowers and hand written note‚Ä¶"
September 2023,A Perfect Honeymoon Experience! ,"Very thankful to The Milestone for making our honeymoon extra special.  The accommodations, the location and the historic building itself were all outstanding and the service and the staff were truly world class.  Their attention to the little details of every aspect sets them apart from other locations I have stayed.  Highly recommended.  "
August 2023,True British Flavor and Service That Goes Above and Beyond,"So many London lodging have lost their British flavor, attention to the smallest detail and staff that emanates caring. Not The Milestone. We formerly had stayed at a variety of hotels, the best  being The Stafford and Hotel 41, which is a sister Red Carnation Hotel Collection property to The Milestone, but more boutique-y. Hotel 41 does  have a spread of edibles included in the rates and an honor bar. However, based on a strong recommendation from our travel agent, we booked The Milestone and had the best London hotel experience ever. From the uniformed doormen who learned our names and even walked down the sidewalk with us to give directions, to the helpful front desk and efficient concierge team, to veteran General Manager Andrew Pike and fabulous bartender Angelo, we were‚Ä¶"
February 2023,Welcome Home,"‚ÄúWelcome home‚Äù, not welcome back. That is how personal the Milestone has become. What can we say. Personal experience. Great people. From the stories about fishing with Steve the doorman, to true tales about WWII with Joe the Conceirge, to conversations about Scotland with Steve the dining room mgr, everything about the Milestone is personal and fantastic "
January 2023,"More than amazing, words can‚Äôt explain","Amazing amazing amazing!!!!! Me and my fianc√© booked for one night for our anniversary and‚Ä¶ well!! i‚Äôve never enjoyed myself more!!!!! When we entered we were introduced with lovely staff with smiles (Heather at reception and Zen who gave us a building tour and entry). The hotel had upgraded us (for free!!) from a standard room to the Mistinguett Suite (!) and it was more than beautiful- the room was lush with a balcony, in hotel fresh homemade cookies and tea. They also gave us a free cocktail each upon entry (both of which that aren‚Äôt on their bar cocktail menu).   My fianc√© had left a booking note that it was for our anniversary and when we arrived after our meal our room had been tidied and been set up with chocolates on the pillows with rose petals, candles too, and a plate‚Ä¶"
March 2023,Our wedding at the Milestone Hotel,"In January this year we got married at the Milestone Hotel, and let me tell you, It was the best decision we've made!  The ceremony, reception, dinner and the party were all held at the hotel and we cannot complain about one thing. Everything was well organised, food was delicious, staff was incredibly attentive and our wedding suite was just stunning.   Emma, our Banqueting Executive, was in constant communication with us throughout the whole process, making sure that everything was organised as we requested, and nothing was a problem for her. She really tried to accommodate every request we had.  So, If you are looking for a small wedding venue, combined with british luxury, this is it. Don't look no further!  "
April 2023,Amazing!,"Amazing service and accommodations.   Super location, within walking distance to some really good restaurants.  Didn‚Äôt dine in much except for Breakfast - but that menu is outstanding. Concierge & Staff go above and beyond expectations. 5-Star hotel all the way."
April 2023,Great stay in early April,"Beautiful spaces in this hotel. Moderate sized well appointed room  Exceptional service staff Exceptional meals Easy access to bus, underground within a few blocks. Cross the street to Kensington Park and Palace The fitness room is bright and well appointed with jacuzzi/ pool room attached. Sauna  Highly recommended hotel- we will stay again!"
February 2023,Luxe in London,"What an absolutely wonderful hotel. Everything was perfect. The hotel is spotless with the ideal blend of historic charm and luxe, modern decor and amenities. My daughter and I were treated with such kindness. We had high tea which was fabulous and decided to upgrade to a room with a view of the park. Truly incredible. The hotel is perfectly located near the UnderGround‚Ä¶we were able to get everywhere with ease. There is a Santander bike spot 2 blocks away so we were able to rent 2 bikes and cycle Hyde Park‚Ä¶a highlight of our trip. The Milestone is a true 5-star hotel. I can‚Äôt imagine a better way to experience London."
March 2023,"Luxurious in many respects, but missing the RCH personal touch","My wife and I had a 3 night stay at The Milestone recently, at a rate of ¬£430 per night for bed and breakfast. The Red Carnation brand is familiar to us, having stayed 15 times in 6 properties from their portfolio previously. The brand gives us a number of things that we require as guests in a hotel, including luxurious surroundings, a peaceful night‚Äôs sleep on a quality mattress and bedding, good food and wine, but perhaps most important of all ‚Äì quality, personal service. All this doesn‚Äôt come cheap as rates usually start at around ¬£250 in all hotels in the portfolio. The brand has also started adding an ‚Äòoptional‚Äô service charge per night recently.  Having stayed at Summer Lodge in Dorset during August 2022, we decided to give The Milestone a try for the first time since the‚Ä¶"
April 2023,An AMAZING afternoon Tea experience!!,"A wonderful Afternoon Tea! The staff were helpful, friendly and went above and beyond to ensure we had all we needed/wanted. A great time was thoroughly enjoyed and the beautiful settings of the hotel made it a luxurious event celebrating my mums upcoming birthday. The Afternoon tea was fresh, scrumptious and the best I‚Äôve had in London yet! I would recommend anyone to try it and I look forward to returning to try out some more of their food menu. Thank you Milestone Staff x "
March 2023,Beautiful Afternoon Tea - Fantastic service,Beautiful afternoon tea at the Milestone hotel yesterday. The highlights for my was the delicious chicken sandwich rolled in almonds and the black sesame seed macaroon - but in all honesty the whole offering was great and there was an abundance of food. The service we received was great and nothing was too much for them. 
March 2023,Wonderful experience,"Our recent stay at Milestone hotel and residences was excellent. Hotel staff including front desk, house keeping were outstanding . The service was very attentive, we especially appreciated the thoughtfulness of the Front desk, concierge and restaurant service staff who arranged for our breakfast and coffee in ‚Äúto go‚Äù containers when we were running late for a day trip. We look forward to staying at Milestone residences again in future. "
February 2023,Best hotel,"Pleased with my visit to this hotel. The staff was very friendly, efficient, helpful. They greeted me every time, help find transportation and provided good places to visit. The room was fantastic, they kept it clean. The tea experience was wonderful."
February 2023,Our go-to-place in London,"Just came back from a wonderful stay at the Milestone Hotel in London. Have to say that this was one of the best, if not the best, hotel experiences that we‚Äôve ever had in the UK. The service truly is five star - and it is that way throughout the hotel - from the folks who greet you at the entrance to the reception and the restaurants to housekeeping - everyone makes you feel genuinely welcome and appreciated. I do not know for certain of course, but somehow it feels there is a great team spirit and vibe among the staff which gets reflected in this exceptional customer experience. The hotel itself is beautiful with a long history (used to be a stable servicing the Kensington Palace way back in time - thanks doorman Steve for that tidbit of info) and now obviously a truly‚Ä¶"
February 2023,Exceptional Stay at the Milestone Hotel,"We just had a truly special stay at the Milestone. First, the hotel is absolutely beautiful. Second, the service, from the doormen, to the front desk, to the concierge, to the restaurant staff - is the best, the most personal, I have had at any hotel I have ever stayed. The entirety of the staff are engaging, friendly, knowledgable and truly go out of their way to make your experience special, and are clearly empowered to do so. I can rattle off so many examples during our 5 night stay including 1) little treats that were left in our room to welcome us and each night at turndown; 2) the entire restaurant staff recognizing and proactively accommodating a dairy and peanut allergy  within our family even creating a whole separate vegan sandwich/desert plate during our afternoon‚Ä¶"
October 2022,A true gem in the Crown of London hotels,"Whilst being amongst the glitterati of 5 star luxury London hotels, the Milestone stands out for combining the relaxed atmosphere of a beautiful Kensington home, with fabulous bedrooms, great food and service but above all, the friendliness and professionalism that sets Red Carnation apart from the rest. A stay that always seems to exceed expectations."
February 2023,A place that deserves more attention,This hotel is an absolute gem of Kensington!  We had a splendid dinner at the Cheneston's and the staff cannot be more friendly and professional.   The bar team made cocktails tailored to our taste and was always reachable.  Breakfast portion is generous and delicious. Would definitely recommend the omelette.
January 2023,Magical. The place to stay in London.,"We stayed at the Milestone for 4 nights.  We had very high expectations from the reviews and the hotel website and we were not disappointed. The hotel is superb. Clean, comfortable and beautifully decorated. The staff were friendly, helpful and professional. We felt right at home. The afternoon tea was excellent. We also tried the bar which was also very good. The Milestone is our new address in London."
February 2023,Great cocktails,"Stopped by for a quick cocktail and ended up having more than planned! The bar service is fantastic and the cocktails did not disappoint, the most delicious cocktails I‚Äôve had in London in a long time, I cannot wait to return!"
February 2023,Exquisite 8 course tasting menu in Cheneston‚Äôs Restaurant,At a recommendation from my brother in law we decided to give the Milestone a go for dinner.   We arrived early for our reservation and had a drink in the Stables Bar. Lilo was a terrific host and very hospitable and we tried the smoked old fashioned which is a must try!  Paolo the restaurant manager came through to introduce himself which we thought was a very personal touch. Him and the team looked after us and recommended we tried the new tasting menu that had recently launched.   We were blown away by the quality of the food and the attentive service. A hidden gem found right on our doorstep.
February 2023,Disappointing return visit..,"Recently returned from a 3 night family staycation to celebrate a big 40th Birthday. We were so excited to return to The Milestone Hotel after being blown away by our initial visit last year. Disappointingly, there were no bells and whistles to speak of at check-in this time, no offer of a welcome drink etc.. The receptionist didn't reference that we were return customers, instead she repeatedly apologised for the slow computer system when trying to authorise our credit card for incidentals. It was disappointing not to get that home from home welcome that we'd been so looking forward to since booking this stay last year!   After check-in was completed we made our way into the lounge area for our champagne afternoon tea reservation. Unfortunately, the cold and impersonal‚Ä¶"
February 2023,5 STAR HOTEL AND SERVICE,Myself and my partner recently had a night in London and decided to book this beautiful hotel due to the close proximity to the royal albert hall. The hotel and service was immaculate from start to finish. The staff really go above and beyond to make your stay memorable. I loved the quirky old english style to this hotel and the room was just breathtaking. Thank you so much for an amazing stay. Hope to visit again in the future
January 2023,The best hotel stay ever,"My wife and I traveled with our 18 year old son to London for the first time and were warmly greeted by the front desk staff and night manager, who offered a host of valuable recommendations for our stay. Our junior sweet room was lovely and beautifully appointed, with excellent, comfortable bedding. The hotel ambience was exactly what we had hoped for, the food was delicious, the service was exceptional . I could not recommend a hotel more highly and our family is already scheming to find a way to return in the near future. "
January 2023,Beautiful hotel great location,"My first visit as I usually go to hotel 41, I thought this hotel was charming with beautiful rooms. I will definitely be back at some point and highly recommend it. The conservatory and bar area are quaint and cosy, the breakfasts and meal we booked were of a high standard."
January 2023,Surpassing my expectation every time!,"As always, The Milestone Team surpass my expectations every time.   From the warmest of welcomes at the Front Desk by Lenora, to the accommodating manner when I arrived extra early.   To the fun and intimately familial conversations with Steven at the front door.    I was very grateful that Lenora and Lino offered me the use of the conservatory to host my meetings, and Callum furnishing me with a lovely (complimentary) pot of tea and your delicious cookies pack.  It was an absolute pleasure to meet Zen again, as she'd supported me with pre-arrival preparations.  It only got better and better as my stay progressed.     The beautiful upgrade was a lovely surprise and even more special was the little gift so expertly wrapped in red tissue.   So thoughtful and above and beyond the‚Ä¶"
January 2023,Beyond the excellence,"We  had dinner at the hotel and we were simply astonished by the extreme care for the client, by the excellent cuisine and , last but not least, by the settings of the table, including silver or Sheffield underplates . When originality meets tradition that‚Äôs the Britishness we love and that must not be lost. The very kind employees let us visit the rooms and we are thinking of staying there when in London: as I wrote in the title they are beyond the excellence. Sometimes dreams come true."
January 2023,What a fantastic weekend celebrating my wife's birthday,"I'm not sure I can add more than what most people have said about this hotel, except for simply ""Wow"".  From the moment we arrived, you are treated with such warmth.  Sam, who checked us in, took us around the hotel explaining the history of the hotel and you could just tell the passion he had for it.  You instantly feel apart of the family and the hotel is just so eloquently decorated, and feels so warm and cozy.    We had booked a deluxe King which was sufficient for us, as we were planning on being out majority of the time.  The room was lovely and again the quality of the finish and decorations was amazing (maybe just firmer pillows would be nice).  Sam was very happy to show us how everything worked.  As we were celebrating my wife's birthday, Sam kindly offered us a‚Ä¶"
January 2023,Wonderful Bar,"Few days ago I went with my friends to the Bar at Milestone , the place looks Beautifull! Cocktails were delicious , but the Best thing was a service! Victoria bartender was fantastic, great service with a smile !  Angelo ( I Hope I wrote name correctly) bar manager was also fantastic! Highly recommended!"
January 2023,Absolutely the BEST ,"For a top of the line meal the Milestone cannot be beat. The atmosphere is awesome. The wait staff is top notch. The prices are at the top end as well. We had dinner and our waiter, Angelos was absolutely the best!! He‚Äôs from a well trained British service that leaves nothing to chance. His attention to detail is impeccable. The food and presentation were out of this world. For a special occasion I don‚Äôt think you could do any better than the Milestone!"
December 2022,Excellent service and great cocktails,"I went with my friends to have couple of drinks and the drinks were amazing along with the staff. The ambience of the bar itself is amazing. I will like to praise victoria and angelo for thier lovely and warm service, I am definately gonna go back again."
December 2022,"Fabulous hotel and staff, memorable stay","Enjoyed a fantastic few days during the second week of December 2022 at this amazing hotel.  I have stayed at other Red Carnation properties in London and they are all amazing.  I have always wanted to stay at the Milestone and was thrilled that I was able to do.  Everything was exceptional and I can highly recommend a stay here.  Firstly, I was to visit London at this time with my best friend with whom I had travelled to London (and beyond) for 30 years.  This would have been our 30th anniversary of travelling as our first stay was in London early December 1992. Unfortunately, she was diagnosed with a terminal illness at the end of August and sadly passed away at the end of September.  Initially I did not feel like going ahead with the visit to London but decided to go ahead on‚Ä¶"
January 2023,Quintessential London Hotel,"Whenever I travel to London, I make a point of staying at a different hotel every time I go, just to get a different experience every time am there.  That is now going to change, as I will be staying at the Milestone Hotel for all my future visits to London.  In addition to the hotel being incredibly charming, the staff was above and beyond accommodating and helpful.  The Milestone is a perfect representation of London."
September 2022,One of the Best Ever,"I‚Äôve stayed over 1000 nights in hotels across the world and I can honestly say Milestone is in the top 5.  The most differentiated aspected was the service over our 5 days there. Everyone was so kind, pleasant and attentive. Highly recommend."
August 2022,British hospitality at its best,"I have been to London many times and seen many luxury hotels but, to me, The Milestone is by far the best of them all. The building is absolutely magnificent, quiet, with a typically British elegance.  Breakfast is fantastic and the afternoon tea an unmissable experience. Being hosted  in this hotel makes you feel at home away from home, thanks to the staff of an amazing standard."
September 2022,Extra Touches and Exemplary Service,"My family had the pleasure of staying at the Milestone  on a recent trip to London.  The location is wonderful, just off Kensington Gardens and a short walk to both Kensington Palace and Hyde Park.  The service here is personable, professional and something all hotels should aim to achieve.  Every person we interacted with made us feel like an old friend and made an effort to get to know us better.  They treated us like royalty.  They also made special efforts to recognize and ensure my 12 year old had a great stay.  We will be back!"
September 2022,Perfect Stay with Exceptional Service,"From the moment we arrived at Milestone Hotel, we were greeted by Steve and instantly felt welcome. We had flown in early morning and were delighted when we were provided with an early check-in. We only stayed one night during a layover but wished we had been able to stayed for longer.   The room was spacious with a comfortable bed, there was a huge TV with a variety of shows and movies to watch, the bathroom was beautiful and the finer touches throughout the hotel and room made for a memorable experience.   The location of the hotel is perfect. We enjoyed a walk through the gardens opposite the hotel in the morning. We cannot wait to stay here again in future."
August 2022,A lovely and special gem!,"What a lovely experience!  The team at the Milestone was very helpful and attentive and went the extra mile for us and made sure that we had what we needed. Even when they could jot accommodate a hosting tea, they arranged for it at a nearby hotel. My mother loved it! Thank you!"
January 2022,London Visit,"Staying at the Milestone was like coming home.  The moment we walked through the door we were treated like family!  There wasn‚Äôt one member of the entire staff, from the front desk to the concierge to the restaurant servers or bartender and right out to the doormen, that weren‚Äôt welcoming, helpful and working with smiles on their faces. Service throughout the hotel was impeccable.  Without a doubt we will return !!"
August 2022,"Exquisite, we'll be back!","The best of the best. Customer service was outstanding and nothing was too much trouble. We felt like we were walking on air. Thank you to all the fantastic staff that clearly take pride in their work. We're planning on returning this year, and it can't come soon enough!"
August 2022,A Home from Home in the heart of London,"From Steve's truly 'Londoner' welcome at the front entrance of this wonderful establishment  - and (currently) my favourite in the Red Carnations Hotel Group - I know why it was worth returning to such a family-oriented Home from Home.    I'm very grateful that you made my return stay extra special and gave my Mother a wonderful time full of memories she will talk about for years to come.    Thank you Emma (Front Desk), John (Concierge), Grant, Paolo, Donna (Restaurant), Heather and Lilu (Bar) and the great Bobby (Maintenance).     They all helped to make my stay fantastic.    I'm looking forward to returning again soon."
August 2022,Outstanding Service,"The Milestone is our hotel of choice when visiting London. The staff and the service they provide are outstanding and we are on a first name basis with most everyone we interact with: Zdravko, Zen, Steve, Tim, Lillo, Angelo, Leo, Renato, Yulia, Claire, and Heather. The food and bar service are excellent, the rooms are comfortable and well appointed. We love staying at the Milestone."
August 2022,Perfect!,"A truly *perfect* hotel experience, with some of the warmest, most personal service we have ever received! We stayed in July/August for five nights, dined in the restaurant and also had afternoon tea.  There are so many things to celebrate about this gem of a property -- a generous room upgrade, fantastic breakfast in the beautiful Cheneston's, above-and-beyond turndown service -- but one fun anecdote in particular: my son mentioned to one of the staff members that his birthday fell during our trip and we would be taking a steam train outing to celebrate. We returned home on his birthday evening to a birthday cake, a steam train toy, and a very sweet personalized birthday card signed by 15 of the staff. My son was so overjoyed and felt really special! We've barely departed but‚Ä¶"
June 2022,Wonderful hotel!,"Milestone has this special atmosphere and brilliant service that makes us come back again and again. Great location opposite Kensington Gardens, friendly and caring people, luxury feeling. We will be backüòÑ"
June 2022,Superb,"I heard of the Milestone from my cousin in London.  It did not disappoint.  High class amenities with detailed oriented service.  Right at the Kensington High Street, you can go shopping or go for a walk in the park.  They have a pool, gym and a sauna.  American style outlets in the room for American guests was a great touch too.  Do the Afternoon Tea if you can!  It was incredible."
May 2022,Perfection,"What can you say about a perfect stay being taken care of by some of the best of the best in the hotel industry, except everything was perfection  From the staff to the food, the rooms to the bed and pillows I cannot fault anything   Rarely am I sad to leave a hotel but I was when I had to leave the Milestone  I cannot imagine staying anywhere else when in London"
May 2022,I didn't want to leave,"I can't express how much we enjoyed our stay at the Milestone. I'm very picky but can't find a thing I'd complain about. The service was over-the-top friendly and impeccable. The employees treated us like family. Jose the concierge planned our days and made reservations to some wonderful restaurants. He also went overboard when he retrieved and shipped my husband's cell phone from the train station lost property office. He wouldn't take a tip for that!   The room was beautiful, well appointed, comfortable and solidly quiet. The hotel was just lovely. Breakfast was delicious.  I can't wait to stay again on my next trip to London."
May 2022,Excellent service,"We chose Milestone to be the venue of our special day and we‚Äôre glad that we did. The service that was given was fantastic! Leo was very responsive with all the queries and made sure that everything went according to plan. He even accomdated our last minute alterations which was a very big bonus.  I also commend the amazing and friendly staff, they always make you feel that you‚Äôre valued and give their 100% best. A thank you is an understatement for making our special day more special and memorable. Milestone is definitely a highly recommended hotel, with a very accomdating and superb staff. You will surely find your stay worthwhile."
June 2022,A home away from home,"We arrived for a 2 week stay to find our 2 BR Residence already supplied with plenty of food in the fully equipped kitchen, including washer and Dryer and dishwasher.  With a little exploring, we found several food stores, the Goat Tavern and a wonderful little Italian restaurant just down the block.   Many of our favorite museums are within a short walk.  If we needed to go further afield, the Kensington High tube station and bus stops were very convenient.  All of that was wonderful, but the very best part of staying at the Milestone was the staff!  To a person, each was unfailingly helpful from a bucket of ice and a lemon in our apartment daily at 5 PM to directions and recommendations as well as attentive listening to our adventures at the end of the day.  I really can't‚Ä¶"
May 2022,Amazing Hospitality,"We just checked out of the Milestone after a wonderful stay. Starting with the service and hospitality, it was simply perfect. Everyone working at the hotel including Jose and Steve are so generous and kind. Our room was very unique and comfortable. The Milestone truly makes you feel at home and I would highly recommend this hotel. Next time I am in London, I would like to return!"
May 2022,Overall satisfaction.,We felt you were totally taking care of us.  At no time did we fell we were alone.  We were to leave several days ago but because of our exposure to  Covid we were not able to return to the US.  Now we can we are almost saddened.  We will return.   Thank you.
May 2022,Ann Forkey,"I have just found my new favorite hotel in London! The ‚ÄúMilestone Hotel and Residences‚Äù in Kensington was wonderful. From beginning to end everything was perfect- the location was phenomenal (being located directly across from Kensington Garden and Palace), the interiors were exquisite and the food was delicious, but most important was the service. The staff were a very friendly well trained group of professionals who made me feel like I was at home.  I absolutely loved staying there and can‚Äôt wait to come back again soon. I can‚Äôt thank them enough for making me feel safe and sound at their beautiful hotel!"
April 2022,Tea time,Wonderfull place nice workers delicious pastries and generous quantities  They even suggested a take away bag because we couldn‚Äôt finish all the dishes They offer skones also home made It‚Äôs also well placed I totally recommend üíØ
March 2022,Rooms matters,"We stayed in a deluxe queen. When we first arrived we were given a room with a small ""queen bed"". The first room to us was really small and the bed seemed the size of two twin beds. We would have really regretted our stay. That is why I'm rating the rooms average. The first room we had should be for single travelers or a different category. We asked to move and luckily there was a room available in the ""same"" category. It made all the difference not only was the bed bigger but also the room itself. Beyond that the staff were helpful, responsive, and friendly. The warm breakfast was great. The hotel is in a nice area by stores, shopping, and restaurants. It felt safe to walk around and close to the subway. The hotel is nicely styled. Not large and grand more of a boutique feel.‚Ä¶"
March 2022,A Wonderful Anniversary weekend,"It was several years since we last stayed at the Milestone and this trip has reminded us of what we have been missing. We could not have been welcomed more warmly, the staff have all been exceptional and the whole place is traditionally elegant and classy.  A wonderful anniversary weekend and hopefully we will be back again this time next year!"
February 2022,Amazing place,"loved this hotel, you feel completely comfortable,  they cant do enough for you and it really feels like a happy team.   We had both dinner and breakfast here, again it was lovely the chef goes above and beyond and you can taste he/she looks their work."
February 2022,A home from home,I have been visiting the Milestone Hotel for some years now and every time I arrive and get that warm friendly greeting I know I have arrived at what I now call my home from home. Service is always warm but discreet you are always made to feel welcome and nothing is too much. Accommodation is excellent and it is in a wonderful location. Food is always good whatever you decide on and a good wine cellar is on hand too. My husband and I just love it at the Milestone.
February 2022,Fab food and staff,"My friend and I went for afternoon tea here; the amount and quality of food was incredible - we couldn‚Äôt finish everything! But I‚Äôm mainly writing this review to thank the concierge Steve, he helped us park, had a laugh with us and made us feel so welcome. Thank you so much Steve, From the girls who struggled parking x"
February 2022,Lovely Hotel,"Re visited the Milestone as it was handy for the Royal Albert Hall. Remains one of the friendliest upmarket hotels in London. Very welcoming, with a glass of champagne on arrival. We had an unusual room heavily mirrored with a bathroom down a short flight of steps. Was interesting though perhaps not quite what I had expected. Very comfortable and we had a lovely stay. The bar remans cool but very traditional. My kind of place. Could have sat drinking cocktails all evening. Breakfast is exceptional. Overall it is a lovely hotel, one of my favourites in the capital."
February 2022,A charming hotel in the heart of Kensington,"What a wonderful hotel this was for our two night stay in London. We arrived early on Saturday at approximately 11:45 and were greeted by a very friendly receptionist (Heidi) who said our room was ready. We had the Princess Suite and were so impressed by everything. The decor was very tasteful and we loved the fact the hotel had gone to the trouble of organising a tiny dressing gown for a 8 month old. The breakfasts are plentiful and delicious and nothing is too much trouble. Likewise, we had a three course meal for one of the evenings and had some of the most delicious food we‚Äôd ever tasted. We hope to come back!"
February 2022,Home away from home,"Myself and my husband had a delightful stay at milestones. Nothing was too much trouble. Room was very comfortable and had a fantastic night sleep. Lovely view over Kensington palace. We had breakfast at the hotel and there was plenty of choice and was cooked very well. All the staff in the hotel were extremely friendly and attentive. Would recommend and would certainly stay again. Hotel was in great location for Kensington palace, Albert hall, South Kensington and harrods."
February 2022,The best service we‚Äôve ever had,"My partner and I have have stayed in many hotels across London and  we can honestly say that this by far the best hotel we‚Äôve visited. This is almost entirely down to the quality of service and the quality of the team, who are second to none. Worth every penny and we will be back as soon as possible."
February 2022,Quintessentially British Home from Home. A pure Delight!,"I truly felt that this was a quintessentially British Home from Home.  It was a wonderfully RELAXING first visit to you.   The Spa facilities were great and a lovely treat not usually found in Boutique London hotel.   Angelo in the Bar was fun and attentive.   Your Team are a credit to the Hotel, and couldn't do enough for me - they made me feel very special,  as if I was the only one at your Hotel.   I'm so pleased I chose to stay with you, and am very much looking forward to my stay at Rubens next month, now I know it's part of the Red Carnations Brand."
April 2022,Wonderful Experience,"My wife for for my birthday 2020 got me tickets to see a show in London weekend of 05/02. We wanted to stay in London and the company i work for have done work over the years for Red Carnation Hotels, so we decided why not try the Milestone.   From the moment we walked in we felt at home. We was welcomed in by the concierge who directed us to the desk and to Arella, who was absolutely wonderful in her approach and level of service. She was so courteous to ask what we were up to and gave recommendations on places to eat and also said if we needed any restaurants booked that they would be happy to book on our behalf.   She showed us to our room, showed us everything and even arranged some drinks to be brought up to our room. We then returned from our walk about and early evening‚Ä¶"
April 2022,Just wonderful,"My wife and I were celebration our 45th anniversary in London and we chose to stay at the Milestone based upon out sons and daughters-in-laws recommendation.  The Milestone was everything we could have expected and more.  Everything was just perfect from the time we arrived until the time we departed.  It is a great location, private enough yet accessible to everything.  I cannot say enough about the staff, the entire staff, from doorperson, to front desk, to concierge, to dining room, to bar tender, to household staff.  Friendly, open honest, more there to be your partner and facilitator rather than servant.     Mt wife coordinated with Jose (concierge) and Jose organized our entire trip itinerary, no small task, especially since this was our first trip to London.  We had out‚Ä¶"
April 2022,Fabulous for people and pets,"The Milestone met all the requirements you would expect for human guests. The staff were polite and attentive. The room was exceptionally comfortable - we had a suite which had a two seater sofa, two chairs, a small table, a window seat, a desk and office style chair. It was all very well appointed, and the included breakfast was lovely.   We also took our dog, who is anxious and a little stand-offish with people. When The Milestone say they are ""pet friendly"", they're not exaggerating. We had to notify the hotel in advance (as you might expect) that we were bringing a dog, and there was an extra ""pet deposit"" to pay, which isn't a surprise.   Some hotels will put guests in shabbier rooms if they are bringing a dog, but that wasn't the case here at all. Our room was furnished‚Ä¶"
April 2022,One of the best hotels in which I have ever been,"The hotel is extremely cosy. The overall structure is elegant & takes you behind in the Victorian age.  The staff is extremely warmful: they made us feeling as at home (or better).  The quality of the breakfast is extremely high, as well as the service at the tables."
April 2022,Home from Home,"Just a lovely place to stay, very friendly and welcoming but highly professional staff at every turn. The hotel is in a nice location, just across the road from Hyde Park and very near Kensington Palace. The Royal Albert Hall is a short walk up the road from the hotel. The restaurant, bar and conservatory are great places to relax and enjoy food and drink and the service is simply exceptional."
April 2022,Iconic and practical,"The Milestone is both luxurious and cozy. The staff is helpful, warm, and made every detail of my stay perfect. I was in London on a solo vacation and staying at the Milestone felt like coming home! The dining areas are especially gorgeous and will instantly make you feel like you have done London right. I look forward to bringing my family to the Milestone next time! The smoked salmon at breakfast was the best smoked salmon I‚Äôve ever had - and I‚Äôm a New Yorker so I‚Äôm picky. The concierge Fran helped me mail an important package on my last day there and it was such a relief to have his help. Absolutely five stars."
April 2022,Perfect Hotel & Perfect Location,"Faultless Visit- sheer detail made it a perfect trip to the capital. Super impressed with the staff who went above and beyond to ensure we were well looked after. Champagne on arrival, chocolates, homemade cookies, and the most wonderful Doorman (Steve) who made our trip even more special with the added kindness that was never expected.  Olivia on reception also deserves a special mention as she was so welcoming and friendly and made the checking in process smooth and efficient.   Thankyou for a wonderful stay for my Hubby‚Äôs 30th. We will be back and wouldn‚Äôt dream of staying anywhere else when in London!   10/10- breakfast too!   Many Thanks- Holly & Lawrence Carter"
March 2022,"Elegant Oasis, in London","We stayed at The Milestone for a week. The doorman (James) made our stay feel like we were at home---he quickly learned our name,  offered great local travel advice, and always welcomed us back to the hotel. The bar is cozy, the restaurant great food....The service people overall were very attentive and helpful. Seemed like everyone was ready to help with anything, yet never intrusive. I would STRONGLY RECCOMEND."
April 2022,Long weekend stay for wife and her sister,"I used to live 10 metres down the road from the Milestone, in Kensington Court, and popped in a number of times for a meal or afternoon tea. I booked my wife and her sister 2 nights there for a weekend escape to London from Finland and they loved it. Fantastic period property, gorgeous interiors, excellent service - and of course the location is splendid for being in the heart of RBKC."
April 2022,An excellent stay,"Wow! What a find. We stayed at The Milestone as we were attending a concert at the Royal Albert Hall.   Generally we tend to stay in larger hotels when in London so all the facilities and services are at hand.  Well The Milestone offered every facility you could possibly need and more.  What sets The Milestone apart is the highly trained staff who not only seem to anticipate your every need but do so with a smile, humour and a lot of personality. Stephen, the doorman sets the scene but every one we met was friendly, kind and caring, especially to our parents who joined us on this stay. And a shout out for the people who also maintain great standards including housekeeping and great cooking.   Our room, although I thought on the small side, had every possible amenity. The bed was‚Ä¶"
December 2021,Afternoon tea,"We went to The Milestone for afternoon tea on Sunday and had the most superb experience. The staff were simply fantastic and were so kind and welcoming, as well as attentive to us, and especially to my children, whose birthday tea it was. They made it such an incredible experience, suggesting the girls tried various teas as well as bringing out an extra treat in honour of their birthday, and they absolutely loved it. Everyone we met during our short visit from the super waiting staff to the doorman and concierge, was very kind, professional and friendly. We would highly recommend the hotel for afternoon tea."
December 2021,Christmas Came early for us!,"I was hoping to keep this 5 star property the best kept secret in London!   I have reviewed dozens of hotels and restaurants in London over the last 25 years, but I cannot remember when I thought an experience was so deserving of an excellent review!  Having been recommended by some friends to stay at the property we booked two rooms for our Christmas shopping weekend, upon arrival at the Steve greeted us with a warm welcome, this warm welcome continued at our check in desk with Aurelle, our luggage was immediately taken to our to exquisitely appointed rooms, this property has the boutique feel of opulence which has been lost in the more well known 5 start hotels in central London, I certainly have paid considerably more for far less quality,style, and service at other‚Ä¶"
December 2021,This is rare praise - Staff was truly outstanding and property embodied classic British ambience,"I am truly feeling privileged to write such a glowing review. Its rare, as I travel globally and often, so this is really saying something. My colleague and I were in London for a week of meetings and incredibly busy.  The staff - great personalities, remembered our names after the first day, helped us with anything we needed. I could name many of them but then I would have a long list! What surprised me was the true feeling of caring - I know this may sound odd but this team did not make us feel like they were working at a job. They made us feel as though they were happy with what they were doing and each individual was a professional and bent over backwards to make sure every detail of our stay was catered to. Do I need to tell you that is so very rare these days? So kudos to‚Ä¶"
December 2021,Deserves more than 5 stars!,"Excellent customer service from all staff, Nutten, Fran and Mansour were great. Very attentive, helpful , friendly and at our service. Nutten showed us several rooms before my wife agreed to one. They allowed early check in snd late check out. Overall anazing ghrought!"
October 2021,"Not so good in parts, overall though a nice stay. I would come again.","Try and keep this short. All in all, the hotel was a nice stay. Great little details are part of the stay. The interior is nice. They‚Äôre the odd flaws with decor, which I‚Äôll add with photos. With 5 star the interior should be on point and you need to be hiring people who can do diy well. So not good in parts. The car service that‚Äôs part of the hotel, you have to prebook, which it doesn‚Äôt say that on the booklet in the hotel, so that needs to be corrected. The cocktail I had, wasn‚Äôt good. The guy behind the bar is poor at what he does. Not a good time as the bar at all, didn‚Äôt finish my drink and I just left. My partners was ok, but it was a simply gin and tonic, so how wrong can it go, the presentation could have been better. The service was very slow. The bar snacks came late‚Ä¶"
November 2021,A brilliant stay,"This was a short stay but thoroughly relaxing. The hotel is english mansion style (but in London) with outstanding service. Particular thank you to Angelo in the bar who was fantastic snd made some great recommendations.   The hotel thinks of everything, something I like. The staff are not fussy or overbearing but friendly and engaging. Despite spending only 24 hours here I came incredibly relaxed after a fairly stressful week.  Stayed in a studio room which I‚Äôd highly recommend. The room felt spacious and was very comfortable. I think the beds are savoir- they were very comfortable anyway! Needless to say the room was spotless and turndown was excellent.   The whole hotel is charming. If your definition of luxury is the very latest technology, a huge pool etc, this isn‚Äôt the‚Ä¶"
November 2021,Afternoon Tea was fantastic,"Visited The Milestone Hotel for Afternoon Tea with my mother. We had an absolutely fantastic time, the food was delicious and they were generous with their portions, we were so full we ended up taking some sweet treats home with us. We were served by Leo and Paulo and they were so welcoming and we felt extremely well looked after. Would recommend to everyone. Thank you all for a very special time."
November 2021,Home from Home,"After  a really hectic few months, my husband and I were looking forward to spending a few nights at the Milestone Hotel, it did not disappoint. All the staff pulled out the all the stops to ensure we had a really comfortable break, their attention to detail was excellent in all departments.  My welcome card read Welcome home Mrs P and that‚Äôs how it felt. We had a wonderful stay and came home refreshed"
November 2021,Home again !,"I absolutely love the Milestone, the team, the ambiance.  I cannot imagine staying anywhere else when I am in London;  this time was no different.  The fact I can bring my dog as well just makes it even more special.  She was treated as well (if not better!) than me. Her own bed, bowls and treats.  Just wonderful.  There are so many good points and so many fabulous staff to mention -  from walking through the front door, to the bar where my dog could join me, it is all impeccable."
November 2021,Fantastic Christmas Weekend,"After a trip to Winter Wonderland walking through the doors of The Milestone was like walking into a home from home.  We stopped into the stables bar for a couple of drinks and were served by Angelo - fantastic service, amazing atmosphere!  My partner had the Milestone Traditional which comes in its own smoke filled bubble and was a joy to experience.  I had the Valkyrie drink and the Rocking Horse - both as beautiful as they were delightful.     The room was just stunning!  A level of class and comfort unmatched so far in my time in London.  The bed was so comfy we almost overslept!    All service was impeccable and calm - you forget they are there until you need them, and then they‚Äôre there happy to help.   Can‚Äôt recommend this place enough and will most definitely be back‚Ä¶"
October 2021,Festive Afternoon Tea,"This was my second visit to The Milestone ‚Äòpost pandemic‚Äô and this time I tried their take on a Christmas afternoon tea. wow. I type this from my sofa and I still feel completely and utterly indulged.  The service team were fantastic, the lounge was full but the team were still attentive, smiling and taking care of all guests with ease.  We tried several teas and enjoyed a half bottle of champagne.  The selection was outstanding and by far the best Turkey sandwich I have ever had.  Kudos to the milestone team, especially mr Ahuja who took my booking, greeted me and my family on arrival and even checked on my table."
October 2021,Ataur & Livia Wedding Reception,"This hotel and it‚Äôs staff are absolutely amazing, they could not be any more helpful, such lovely and very nice people, they made us feel like royalty. We celebrated our wedding reception here with family and friends and the experience thanks to the hotel was absolutely 5 star. I enjoyed Avery minute of and will be coming back every year to celebrate my anniversary here. Leo Forte was the best, he made us feel so comfortable and had everything under control. He went above and beyond with everything, from the welcome, to the food and the decorations, I honestly cannot praise him enough. Angelo was amazing with the Sabbrage and allowing me to try, a memory I will forever cherish. The food was amazing thanks to the chef Daniel and his team. This hotel has been the best I have been‚Ä¶"
September 2021,JimG,"Great find, small clean, amazing service. The Stables Bar hosted by Angelo made it a unique and pleasant visit. He loves making cocktails. Makes a Old Fashion using a unique blend of scotch and whiskey ü•É"
August 2021,Outstanding hotel with loads of English charm!,"We had a marvelous stay at The Milestone Hotel!  The doorman Steve enthusiastically greeted us upon arrival and check-in was super easy with friendly and welcoming staff.  The hotel itself is charming with English ‚Äútouches‚Äù everywhere.  Hotel was immaculate and felt very safe with their Covid precautions.  They gave us a complimentary upgrade on our room to a king size bed.  The room was clean and updated with an extremely comfy bed and pillows.  The room had an outlet panel that allowed for American plugs so super helpful for hair straightener and charging our iPhones without having to use a voltage converter, even though we had brought one.  We didn‚Äôt spend a lot of time at the hotel as we were out and about seeing the sights of London, but did enjoy a few drinks in the bar‚Ä¶"
September 2021,"Amazing wedding and a lovely stay, thank you so much!","The team at Milestone helped us organise our small, intimate wedding after COVID ruined our plans for a big countryside wedding.  I just wanted to say both Leo and Angelo did an amazing job and we'll be customers for life. Couldn't be happier with it."
September 2021,Absolutely outstanding venue for a private dinner,"We were looking for a venue to host a private dinner for 24 people to celebrate two ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù birthdays. From the first contact with Milestone they could not have been more friendly, efficient and professional. The interior of the hotel is very elegant and reminiscent of its private home origins. Suggestions for organising the evening which began with drinks in the Lounge followed by dinner on three tables in the Windsor room were very helpful. On the night everything from the greeting of guests by the doorman, through to the service in the Lounge and then the dinner were very organised. We had been offered a choice of menus for the guests to select from and all of them have commented on the quality of the three courses, the Amuse Bouche and the Pre- desert. A very enjoyable‚Ä¶"
September 2021,a lovely return....,"We haven't visited The Milestone for a few years, and happily returned to this beautiful and excellently-run hotel.  It is everything one expects of a 5* and more.  Andrew and his entire team, from housekeeping to maintenance and front-of house to dining are a credit to the prestigious Red Carnation Group.  Safety measures are carefully observed without being intrusive, and attention to detail is key.  Thank you all for a wonderful stay."
September 2021,Afternoon Tea,"Went here for afternoon tea. The room where tea was served was much smaller than I expected and was really only big enough for 4/5 couples. This meant that we could hear other people‚Äôs conversations, particularly two gents who were talking loudly while having tea , which was a bit off putting. However, that is where the criticism ends.   The staff were very polite and went above and beyond to make the experience really nice. The selection of sandwiches and cakes was fantastic and delicious. There was a variety of teas to try and we were offered top ups of all refreshments- if you can manage it. We were too full!   I would definitely recommend this hotel for afternoon tea."
August 2021,5 star hotel with 6 star staff.,"The Milestone hotel truly lives up to Bea Tollman‚Äôs saying ‚ÄòYou can build a palace, but it means nothing if you don‚Äôt focus on your guests. All guests want to feel special‚Äô‚Ä¶. The staff were very successful in this. Making my partner and I feel that we were the only guests and totally special.  An awesome hotel, steeped in history and an individual uniqueness."
August 2021,Two night stay at the Milestone Hotel and our wedding day!,"The team at the milestone and I worked together the last few months in preparation to the wedding day and we felt special throughout.  Leo and his team were absolutely amazing and definitely offered five star service. Leo assisted us with the wedding planning, he went above and beyond to ensure the day went exactly as planned, he even allocated us the perfect guest room - which made me relax on the day as I needed the extra space to do hair and makeup.   Daniel (the chef) custom made the dinner menu and the food was absolutely perfect! It was the best Beef Wellington me and our guests have ever had. We have not stop getting compliments about how great the service and the food was.   Thank you to Leo, Daniel and their teams for making my wedding day extra special to me and my now‚Ä¶"
July 2021,"Excellent stay, charming hotel and fabulous team","Lovely welcome by Tara and the concierge team plus a welcome drink of champagne. Room 303 with small balcony. Intimate room with ""hidden"" wardrobes. Loved the d√©cor and history the Stables (bar). Angelo in the bar √® molto bouno. Ruinart champagne offered, a favourite of mine.  Housekeeping prompt and efficient.  Very comfortable bed and quality linen. Probably the best hairdryer I've ever used in a hotel of this standard, with socket and mirror to hand. A superficial point perhaps but important to me! Peaceful outside with very little road noise (Sunday night).  Breakfast very good in beautiful dining room. Enjoyed the cartoon artwork.  Steve the concierge is knowledgeable, friendly  and has lots of suggestions. Very welcoming.  Great location. Highly recommended. Much enjoyed. ‚Ä¶"
July 2021,A true 5 star hotel,"Perfect in every way. Each staff member is exceedingly kind, going above and beyond to make your stay exceptional. Can not say enough kind things about this hotel and their staff. The location is perfect. The decor, beautiful. Everything in perfect order."
July 2021,An amazing place to stay,"We had a great room with amazing decoration and a lovely ensuite bathroom. The beds are huge and so comfortable. The hotel is in such a great location in London within easy walking distance of many tube stations. The decor is brilliant throughout the hotel - very unique. I love the Stables Bar and the Oratory. The bar staff are very knowledgeable, providing a great list of cocktails and drinks. The whole staff make this a very friendly hotel. I will definitely be back."
July 2021,A fabulous night away from home,We had a fantastic night at The Milestone. The staff are extremely helpful and always have a smile. The room was fabulous providing a great break for us and our dog. we left very well fed and watered having had a very relaxing stay.
June 2021,Hidden Gem,"From the start of my booking to checking out after our stay, the staff at The Milestone have been explementary.  The Chesterton Restaurant far exceeded our expectations with my mother saying ""this is best meal I have had in ages"".  It was very easy conversation with all the staff and nothing was too much trouble especially when we turned up in The Stables Bar at 21.50hrs asking for a dessert which was thoroughly enjoyed by my Mum and Brother, a bottle of organic red wine (delicious) and a bowl of twiglets for myself.  But as a few of the staff are Italian the evening was rounded off by them qualifying for the next round of the Euros.  Danny and Jose  (Concierge) were very knowledge of the area and had a very warm welcome when you come and left the hotel.  This was far better‚Ä¶"
June 2021,"Best high tea in London, again","Visited the milestone after a while for afternoon tea. We used to be regulars with dew years ago and it was fantastic. Glad to say it is even better now! Kudos to the team, we had an excellent afternoon, my guests thoroughly enjoyed it."
June 2021,The best hotel in the world,"There are many things one could say about this hotel: central location, stunning decor, great bar and restaurant. What really makes this hotel better than any else is the staff. They really put the heart in what they do and make your staying memorable.  Leo was really professional and made us feel important.  Steve the doorman is the best, so funny! And prepare to be amazed when you go to visit Angelo and Giacomo at the bar!"
June 2021,First class service,"A real home from home. Service was memorably good. Every member of staff made you feel welcome and looked after, from the lovely doorman and reception team to the waiting staff and housekeeping. I stayed with my young son and they upgraded our room free of charge on arrival to a beautiful suite overlooking Hyde Park. They let us check in early at 7am and re-configured the room to accommodate twin beds. The breakfast was delicious and rooms beautifully clean. This was our first visit to a red carnation hotel and will definitely not be our last."
June 2021,Champagne and Good Cheer,"Champagne afternoon tea to treat my niece. How fabulous to be back in the luxury of my favourite place!  Everybody was so pleased to welcome us and make a fuss of us both. Predictably the afternoon tea was perfection (as always) and Leo and Andrew were on hand to attend to us. Thank you to The Milestone team, cannot wait to return again very soon"
June 2021,"Excellent service, outstanding food a great hotel to go and visit!","I didn't end up staying at the hotel as I live relatively closely, but I have been there a number of times for drinks. This time round we decided to stop by for dinner, the 5 course tasting menu served up by the chef, Daniel, was phenomenal! My partner is also a vegetarian and it is safe to say this didn't dissapoint.   The service led by the manager Leo was fantastic , we also had Angelo serving the drinks (I have had him serve me when I have gone previously) and he has picked out the perfect drinks every time (I am one for trying new things so like hearing the suggestions from the bar staff). One of my favourites was a smokey old fashion but with barrel aged taquila, unfortunately I am allergic to whiskys, and this is the perfect alternative, arguably one of the best drinks‚Ä¶"
June 2021,Hotel stay,"We had a fantastic and memorable short stay at the hotel. The service was first class with and staff very attentive. Incredible food , decadent breakfasts and fantastic cocktails too. Highly recommended."
July 2020,Brilliant Hotel with outstanding service and attention to detail,"I have been to the Milestone Hotel many many times and every time i am astounded at the level of service and attention to detail provided.  On this particular visit to the Milestone we were greeted in the usual friendly and inviting way by the doorman and staff in the reception. Upon arrival Leo escorted us round the hotel showing me the what's what and who's who before we enjoyed the incredible six course tasting meal from the new menu. The Executive Chef, Dan, out done himself on this occasion and i can honestly say that it was one of the best dining experiences i have ever had.  As always after the meal I was handed over to Angelo and Giacomo in the bar and was further treated to the new cocktail menu experience. These two gents really know how to put on a show, from the fun‚Ä¶"
June 2021,"Great hotel, friendly staff, amazing old fashioned!","Had a lovely time, was treated with great reception and enjoyed our stay. Great facilities, would definitely go back. Old fashioned in the bar a must have, ask for Angelo! If you need recommendations of local area Leo was more than helpful too."
June 2021,Beautiful hotel with excellent service and experience,The Milestone delivers an exceptional experience through its staff and its accommodations. The rooms are quiet and beautifully appointed. The food service is excellent. We enjoyed our complimentary full breakfasts each morning in the dining room along with an incredible hotel-catered picnic in Hyde Park for our family. Make sure you visit Stables Bar for a pre or post-dinner cocktail in what has to be one of the coolest bars in London.
May 2021,Amazing welcome home!,"Returning to The Milestone for the first time in 15 months - what an amazing experience! I could not have been more warmly welcomed back, given a beautiful suite, glass of champagne on arrival, staff were as ever really friendly - all asking after my family (remembering the names of my children) and the GM even had a cup of tea with me.  Could not more highly recommend this welcoming, discreet hotel."
April 2021,Attended a themed Evening - with unexpected bonuses.,"This was our first venture 'back into the real world' and we chase this opportunity as it was clearly an intimate environment and experience, therefore number controlled. It was clear on arrival that the staff were genuine with their greeting. So much so that we decided to take afternoon tea , unexpected but such a pleasure. The service was impeccable and quality excellent ( better than the so called best in London of 2019 we experienced not far from Trafalgar Sq ). The room  was quaint and just about in expectation size wise., it overlooked the Park. The feel of the Hotel is very exclusive but without the potential price tag you might expect. As this was our first time, it might be more expensive under different circumstances. The themed meal was expertly presented and the room‚Ä¶"
April 2021,Amazing building in perfect location,"Staff are very professional and kind. They made our stay memorable. Very high standards in all kind of services. Room was spacious and bathroom was stunning. Everything was just perfect, we had a wonderful stay and look forward to coming back here."
April 2021,The perfect home away from home!!,"We love The Milestone Hotel. For the past 12 years, it has provided a home away from home for my parents  when they visit us. Starting with a warm welcome to every need being met with a smile, the service is always outstanding.  The rooms are unique and beautifully appointed. The restaurant is delicious and the Stables Bar is one of the best in London. We cant wait for it to re-open and for many more visits in the future."
November 2020,Milestone Hotel London,"We have stayed numerous time at the Milestone Hotel over the past 12 years. We began in the cozy rooms overlooking Kensington Park when we had no grandchildren and most recently have stayed in the residences with one or two of our six grandchildren for consecutive overnights . Every time it has been utter perfection. The staff always goes above and beyond. My husband and I are accustomed to the best and the Milestone never disappoints. As one of our grandchildren said, ‚ÄúNo one ever wants to leave the Milestone.‚Äù It is very true."
March 2021,Outstanding service,"I stayed at the Milestone Hotel in November for business but was blown away with the service and the attention to detail. From the moment I entered the building to the moment I left, everything was taken care of and I felt completely at home. I was nervous about travelling during a pandemic but the staff made me feel very comfortable and safe. The food was also excellent and delicious. I would love to come back when it is allowed and I will definitely be bringing my family as well."
December 2019,Virtual Mothers Day experience ,"Me, my partner and our mums recently enjoyed the Milestones Virtual Mothers Day experience.  We particularly loved the immersive demonstrations by Head Chef Dan and the mixologist Angelo. Both of our mums were blown away by this and they can not wait to visit the hotel next time they are in London visiting us both.   Angelo- we will see you in May for a long over due cocktail!   Thank you to all! "
December 2019,YESS WE MADE THE BEST CHOICE üî•,It feels like you are part of the family. Wonderful place to stay in front of Kensington Palace. Service is a high priority at this place. It feels like a hot bath every time you are pampered by the staff . I will say go and try this top hot spot
December 2019,Amazing staff,"I had a fantastic stay at Milestone Hotel in December. The room, bed, duvet, chairs, TV screen, bathroom etc was very good. I believe there were in all eight towels in the bathroom, two of them really big and fluffy bath towels. And two bathrobes. Both the room and the bathroom had beautiful d√©cor.  All guests receive a welcome drink in Stables Bar. New guests will also get a tour of the hotel, guided by the butler (yes, the butler).  Do say yes to tuck down service. You‚Äôll get a lighted candle on the bath tub and sweets on the bed (I got a box with nuts and dried fruit the first day and tasty small meringues the next). You also get bottled water, new towels and the bed made ready for sleeping.  What impressed me most at Milestone was the attitude, enthusiasm, attention to‚Ä¶"
December 2019,Stables Bar - Awesome,I've been to many bars in many parts of the world but the cocktails and service here are second to none.The bar itself is such a lovely quiet place to relax in and the staff are amazing knowledgeable and helpful.  I loved one of the cocktails so much I tried to recreate it at home and failed miserably. I emailed the bar and not only did I get a reply within 5 minutes but it was good enough to give me the full recipe.  Everything in this bar and hotel was fantastic. Cannot recommend it enough.
December 2019,Amazing first stay!,"The entire staff at the Milestone was friendly, competent and so welcoming. After checking in, I was shown to a comfortable and tastefully decorated room with design personality. Little touches like small gifts of cookies and tea made it feel like Christmas. I loved the breakfast and even though I was traveling alone, was engaged in conversation by the dining team. Any request was immediately seen to. The cozy Stables bar had 2 incredible bar staff concocting some really special drinks. And as I checked out, there were more cookies for the road. I can‚Äôt wait to stay here again. "
December 2019,"Great location, beautiful setting and perfect service","We go to London at least couple times a year and have stayed at various hotels. The Milestone is hands down our favorite place to stay! The location (Kensington) is not far from Paddington station, making it easy to get to and from Heathrow Express - it's also close to the subway, and just a walk away from a shopping area. However, the hotel itself is right next to the park, providing the proper an escape from the hustle bustle of London. The service is attentive and personable - it felt like they personally knew you versus you being one of many guests. Definitely try the hotel breakfast - it's pretty phenomenal! We will most definitely come back to this charming hotel, thank you for having us!"
December 2019,Wonderful Hotel and team,I stayed at this wonderful hotel for one evening last week. The attention to detail and natural engagement of the front of house team at this hotel is A rare and welcome treat these days. They just know how to do the small things that make a difference so well.
December 2019,Lovely lodgings,"Spent five sumptuous nights in this lovely hotel which reminds you why nobody beats the British for customer care.   Treats each night, lovely linens, down pillows and comforters and a location to die for. But I most appreciated a concierge who knew the town and made terrific restaurant and theatre reservations and a doorman who greets you with a smile whenever you return.  Will stay again when I come to London."
November 2019,Exceptional & Detailed Service,"We stayed at the Milestone Hotel based on the wonderful online reviews and everything mentioned was accurate. The service was amazing and the staff were extremely polite/helpful in all aspects. Tim (one of the doormen) was extremely kind, was always interested in our daily activities and was able to help us with any questions. The hotel was very enjoyable and the rooms were very nice as well as the daily breakfast. I would highly recommend this establishment to any visitors!"
November 2019,Soujourn at the Milestone,"My wife and I spent 4 nights at the end of November at the Milestone. Our stay was fantastic!  The quality, care and attention the staff bestowed on us made us feel at home.  After such a marvelous experience, we plan to return to the Milestone next year.  I would recommend this boutique hotel to anyone with a discerning eye for quality who values intimate, highly personalized interactions."
October 2019,"A beautiful, classic hotel.","We returned to the Milestone for our third visit. I was impressed that all the staff members who had been so helpful on past visits were still with the hotel -- it speaks well of a hotel that it retains quality employees over time. Leo, Peggy, and Natalia were particularly helpful (Thank you!). I would say the quality of staff and their attention to guests is the best of any hotel in which I have stayed. It is genuinely impressive.  A number of the rooms had been renovated since our last stay; the hotel is obviously trying to stay fresh and current. We were in the Matisse Studio, an upgraded room, which to my surprise was decorated with genuine Matisse prints, an unexpected luxury.   We stayed for a full week and enjoyed Thanksgiving dinner at the hotel restaurant. This is a‚Ä¶"
October 2019,Fabulous!!!,"Upon our arrival with total jet lag, the staff immediately made us feel at home.  The Reception Mgr., Ms Byrne, immediately made sure we were comfortable until our rooms were ready since we arrived early a.m.  and the Food & Bev. Mgr made sure we were fed.  The staff was like family and the facility was gorgeous with a wonderful location.  We were there a week and so sad to leave.  I have never stayed anywhere that had staff who seem to care so much and I felt pampered by everyone.  Would definitely stay here again!"
October 2019,"Superb comfort, beauty, service and peace at The Milestone Hotel","From the moment we arrived at The Milestone, our every need was taken care of. We were made to feel very welcome by the doorman, reservation desk attendant and concierge.  Our beautiful room on the top floor looked out to Kensington Gardens.  Treats were in every corner of the room in pretty boxes - chocolate, dried prunes and English tea.  The bed was extremely comfortable, and the bathroom large with luxurious thick towels and bathrobes.  And the room was so quiet!  Turndown service in the evening was very nice, as our bed covering was rather heavy and bulky - someone whisked it away and stored it for us until the next day! Breakfast was delicious, and we could order anything we wanted in addition to the continental breakfast of meats, smoked fish, fruit and pastries.  My‚Ä¶"
October 2019,"Great Location, beautiful hotel, wonderful service","We loved everything about our stay at the Milestone. First of all, the staff is so friendly and helpful‚Äîfrom the cheerful ‚Äúwelcome home‚Äù we got every time we entered, to the directions and restaurant recommendations during our stay, to the personalized welcome notes left in our room‚Äîwe felt genuinely taken care of!  Every meal we had at the restaurant was delicious; staff spoke very highly of the shrimp stroganoff, and it did not disappoint. So tasty! A real highlight of the stay though was definitely the Stables Bar!! Angelo and the bar staff not only make outstanding cocktails, but truly create a fun and friendly environment. Thanks for such a wonderful experience!"
August 2019,Wonderful Fall 2019 Visit at The Milestone Hotel,"I reserved 3 rooms for our party of 5 consisting of friends and family.  We stayed for 4 days.  I booked via email with the Milestone and had numerous questions regarding our rooms, prices and accessibility.  Their reservation staff fully responded to all of my questions with every email and within 24 hours.   They even included pictures of the potential room features that I wanted to know about in advance.  Upon our arrival, our expectations were more than fulfilled for all five of us:  with a personal tour of each of our rooms, detailed questions answered, item requests for the room and travel questions about London answered and/or fulfilled (also done in advance via email), a complimentary drink in the bar and a full English breakfast everyday in their cheery restaurant each‚Ä¶"
October 2019,Beautiful boutique hotel in London,"We chose the hotel because it was in a quiet area of London  - Kensington - across from Kensington palace. We have been to London quite a number of times but had not known about it. We decided to try it. But what a treat when we got there. From check in to check out. Every single detail was attended to. The rooms were incredible- we had suites which were two stories, even the soaps looked like they would have been bought at Fortnum and Masons. There were two types of robes - one for lounging and one for after a bath. For turn down service they lit a candle and placed it at the ledge of the bathtub so there was a dim light at night. The restaurant was great. We had breakfast - wonderful - and an amazing dinner. Every single person was friendly and helpful - from the doorman to‚Ä¶"
October 2019,The most wonderful hotel in London,"The rooms are beautiful,location perfect at the park and the staff all fantastic. They went out of their way to make our stay the best vacation.I highly recommend also their  chauffeur service-Colin and Nahir are both delightful and knowledgeable. The dinner,tea and breakfast--all the best.. A must for a night or a month.."
September 2019,Never stayed at a hotel that was half as good as The Milestone.,"Dear Staff at the Milestone, you are all wonderful. You treated us as Yank family. Kind beyond belief and giving in time, advice and patience. We have never been treated like Royalty and had to come to you and London to experience the royal thing.  Thanks for making my wife‚Äôs birthday special. I highly recommend you. I can‚Äôt wait until I again don‚Äôt plan a vacation and end up in London... God Save the Queen.  Pip, pip and all that stuff.  Irv and Fanny Danesh Your former colony (Birthplace of the American Navy) Marblehead, Massachusetts"
October 2019,Excellent but.....,"We spent 5 nights at the Milestone Hotel and without realizing it also spend an additional 2 nights at another of the Red Carnation Hotels, Hotel 41.  Breakfast is excellent, service, food quality and everything.  Probably the highlight for us at the Milestone.  The other highlight is the concierge, several gentlemen whom know exactly about the surrounding area and there are no shortages to excellent recommendations for dinners, lunches, pubs and so forth.  Their street side service with arrival or departure from any taxi or Uber is also excellent.  Exactly what one wants from a concierge and front of house.  Rooms are also well furnished and a nice style but notably small and the furnishings very unpractical for the size of the room.  Lamps in front of TV's, a plethora of‚Ä¶"
October 2019,Top  Hotel in prime location,"I stayed at the Milestone hotel in mid october and found it to be very convenient in Kensington. It still has the ""british charme"" the larger brand names are sometimes missing, The rooms are individually styed and all comfort is available. On demand you even get a set for coffee/tea preparation. The staff are polite and knowledgeable and you can feel the personal athmosphere. Will come back!"
September 2019,Most wonderful afternoon tea,"My daughter and I visited for her 10th birthday treat and had the most wonderful experience here. From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty, there was not one detail that was missed; from the birthday plate and mini gifts, to the decorate your own cupcake and the kind and welcoming staff. I could not have wished for a better day, the service was absolutely impeccable. Thank you so much for making this day so wonderful!"
September 2019,Phenomenal stay at The milestone,"My mother and I first visit to London will be a stay to remember because of this wonderful hotel. They treated us like royalty. I cannot wait to come back to stay at this hotel. Everyone here all contributed to our stay but a few names that stood out are Concierge Zdravko and John. They are very charming, professional, caring, and gave wonderful customer service. Anything we needed or asked for we were given or directed to. Very knowledgable about the area. The food was also phenomenal, and the room service was very individualized and made us feel special. Every night we returned back to the room it was fixed with chocolates and rose pedels with wonderful music playing. It cannot get any better than that! I most definitely recommend this hotel!"
September 2019,Excellent stay at The Milestone,"Thank you to Mr. Blake who arranged an extremely nice room for us and made sure we had a great experience at the hotel. We visited The Milestone for both business and pleasure. It was our second time staying there and we had a great experience again. The service was fantastic, from the welcome drinks, to the complimentary fruits and sweets. Natalia checked us in and made sure everything was to our liking and Zdravko was kind to give us a complimentary box of breakfast treats to take to the airport since we had to leave at 5:30 in the morning. The service was exquisite and the staff went out of their way to please their guests. We had a fabulous stay and will definitely be back again! Thank you Milestone!"
August 2019,Charming ,"Our first visit to the Milestone - and it was a real joy. We had an exceptional room and the entire staff was most accommodating. Special kudos to Tim, Tom, Jose, Fran, Zdravko and Natalia for making us most at home and answering to our every need. We enjoyed a high tea and probably won‚Äôt eat again for a week. The hotel is right across from Hyde Park and Kensington Palace - so it‚Äôs quite convenient to a myriad of places. A special accommodation - we‚Äôre so grateful we were led to it! Would recommend it to anyone who wants to have access to a plethora of sights - and sounds. Hope to see y‚Äôall again very soon!"
September 2019,The Royal Treatment,My family stopped off in London for a few days on the way back from Greece and stayed at The Milestone Hotel for 4 nights. This was our first time staying at this Hotel and I am now rearranging trips so that we may stop over in London for a couple nights again just to stay at The Milestone.  The location is incomparable as it is across from the beautiful Kensington Gardens (where my husband ran every morning) and Palace. The Hotel's ambience transports you back in time without compromising on present day amenities. The rooms are luxuriously appointed and true to English history with beautiful paintings throughout the Hotel. My boys loved the traditional English breakfast and dinner fare and my husband the Old Fashioned with the aromatic smoke at The Stables Bar. I loved that my‚Ä¶
August 2019,High Tea,"The Milestone was a lovely place for High Tea in the late afternoon.  The atmosphere is absolutely beautiful.  The staff at the Tea were amazing.  Very welcoming and met every single need or request we had.  We enjoyed several wonderful teas and delicious treats.  Everything was absolutely amazing.  Would highly recommend the Milestone.  Now that I have found this gem, I look forward to visiting again and this time staying overnight."
July 2019,The Milestone is Miles Above the Rest!,"Our first night in London we stayed at the Milestone Hotel!  What a wonderful experience!  The rooms were lovely and appointed well.  They might be a bit small, but they make up for that in service!!  The staff could not have been more courteous and truly made me feel like I was home!  Teddy the Doorman was just a delight.  The concierges (I wish I could remember their names so I could give them individual credit!) were absolutely outstanding!  They recommended places to see, local pubs for dinner, and much more and never once steered us wrong!!  If I am in London, I will never stay anywhere else!!!"
December 2018,London getaway,"My wife and I stayed at the Milestone in mid July and had a wonderful experience.  The service was outstanding and I've stayed at plenty of hotels over the years. When we arrived we were greeted at the entrance by the staff who were gracious and attentive. We were given a tour of the hotel which I have never experienced at any other hotel. We were escorted by Fran to our room which was beautifully appointed and the staff left a handwritten card welcoming us to the hotel (very classy). The concierge staff were happy to set us up with tickets for any events we wanted to see. We had a wonderful meal(s) in the hotel restaurant. Champagne Afternoon Tea was a two hour event (a must). Also, we had a romantic turndown service which did not disappoint! When I London, stay at the‚Ä¶"
September 2019,Christmas in London,"The Milestone was lovely in every way. The staff makes one‚Äôs stay very personal. It‚Äôs a special charming hotel.Great location. Beautifully decorated. We loved gathering for a delicious breakfast everyday. Heading out to enjoy the city, and meeting again in the evening for a perfect cocktail in their little bar. We walked easily to shopping and dining in the neighborhood. We loved everything about the Milestone."
July 2019,Amazing hotel,"I only had the pleasure of staying here for one night as it was an anniversary celebration and we were going to a Proms concert at the Albert Hall and this hotel is about a 5 minute walk away. Stayed in the Meghan Suite. Amazing room, died and gone to heaven type of room. Separate dressing room, massive bathroom and the most comfortable bed. Treated like royalty. Nothing was too much trouble, fabulous staff and treatment. Called us all the time by our surname which made us feel special and it's little touches like this that make this hotel so fabulous. Great bar, great drinks, although we had clearly outstayed our welcome in the bar in the evening as the barman stopped the music, turned the lights on and started yawning.  It was 11.30pm, and we were the only ones in the bar so‚Ä¶"
May 2019,Fantastic F&B Experience - truly London's best hotel!!!,"I was lucky enough to experience the Milestone's Champagne Afternoon Tea with my partner. What an experience. From arrival, Steve the Doorman swiftly assisted with parking our car, even though we were not residents of the hotel, he personally introduced us to the F&B host by name, and they took us to our seat in the Park Lounge.  The Park Lounge is full of charm and character, the ideal setting for Afternoon Tea, with fantastic views of the Royal Kensington Gardens.  Sandra, our Host was ever so engaging, but knew her boundaries and wasn't 'over the top' - which is sometimes the case in top London Hotels. She was natural and seemed truly caring, whilst accommodating our needs efficiently.  The pastries and scones were to die for, and Sandra explained the flavors and options‚Ä¶"
May 2019,Wonderful stop,We loveeeeee this place. They go above and beyond. So hospital and accommodating in every aspect.  The bar - stables- is wonderful and the bar tenders are very knowledgeable. Ask for any drink and they will make it for you.
May 2019,Truly a gem of a boutique hotel.,"Stayed at Milestone for 4 nights at the end of May.  Everything about the stay was absolutely delightful.  They have truly perfected the element of service across all staff.  The rooms were charming with attention to small details everywhere.  Luxurious bed linens and bath towels, elegant d√©cor and spacious bathroom was more than I had expected.  Turndown service was a different surprise each night.  Concierge staff were so knowledgeable and equally helpful.  Formal tea was the best I've had.  Dining room menu was exquisite and the food presentation and flavor could not be beat.  Best meal I had in London.  Special thanks to Leo, Food & Beverage Service manager, for his helpful expertise.  The bar area is small and charming with craft cocktails made to order.  I highly recommend‚Ä¶"
May 2019,LOVE IT,"We arrived at the hotel to celebrate 10th anniversary  and my husband  50th birthday. From the first moment we entered, we were greeted with a wonderful warmth, which included a brief tour of the hotel's facilities. The room we booked (Superior) was charming with a super comfortable bed, a luxurious bathroom and complimentary  treats for the double celebration. Breakfast was also excellent and included plenty of options. , I think we'll go back there at the first opportunity. Thank you very much for the perfect vacation.  "
May 2019,Fabulous lunch in a peaceful environment,"Went to lunch at the Milestone hotel this week. The food was absolutely amazing.  I had the sashimi to start which was gorgeous, followed by the pea and mint risotto.  My particular favourite was the vegan meringue and berry dessert.  The meringues were made from chickpeas.  The waiters and waitresses were fantastic and so informative about the dishes.  It was quiet, but I love it like that.  Very tranquil in the centre of London - nice to get away from it all.  It is expensive, I was there for a work lunch but would be a lovely treat for a romantic night out or special occasion."
May 2019,Elegance and warmth,"Our time spent at the Milestone could not have been more lovely.  Each and every staff member served us professionally and warmly.  Our room,  the food, the restaurant, bars, the champagne sabrage, the flowers, the gifts of fruit, scones, sweets that met us each evening all helped to make our stay there a perfect one.  We simply cannot wait to return."
May 2019,Another Great Stay,"We had another excellent stay at the Milestone.  We stayed four nights with our two daughters.  This time we did two connecting rooms.  It was great to have two rooms connected, it basically became a suite since there was an outer door that can be shut from the rest of the floor.  We had a large king size bedroom in a corner of the building.  Very spacious and the bathroom was very nice.      What really sets the Milestone apart is the service from everyone that works there.  From the concierge, the front desk, dining room, housekeeping, everyone is looking to help and gets to know you on a personal basis.  They have an ability to anticipate what you will need rather than you asking which you just do not find in many hotels.    Highly recommend the breakfast, amazing every day. ‚Ä¶"
May 2019,Favorite Hotel in England,We returned for a second stay in last 6 months last week. We usually never stay at a hotel twice as we like new experiences but will choose the Milestone every time we return to London. Staff is simply amazing as are the accommodations and location.
January 2019,Elegant Hospitality,"Walking into the Milestone is like breathing hospitality.You feel like you're staying in an elegant Victorian home.They anticipate all the things that make for a lovely stay - the aroma that greets you at the door, remembering your name, a lighted candle on your tub at night, different treats at bedtime, and wrapping your charging cords to name a few. They answer, ""Of course we can do that"" to any request. I especially enjoyed chatting with Thomas at the bar one evening - well done!"
May 2019,visited the bar at this historic hotel,My daughter and I randomly went into this hotel to have a refreshing gin and tonic- what a treat it was. The bar has a horse racing motif. The service was excellent and the drinks excellent. They were a bit pricey but hey you only live once!
February 2019,Personal Experience make the difference!,"The Milestone ‚Äòhas it all‚Äô, with great location, food, and appointments... but the quality we most appreciated was the staff.  Whether it was the concierge service or Thomas in the bars, people knocked themselves out to make our stay memorable and stress-free.  We‚Äôll surely return!"
February 2019,Beautiful hotel,"Have just returned from a quick one night stay at this lovely hotel. The staff were all exceptionally helpful and friendly and really couldn‚Äôt do enough to make your stay enjoyable.   The hotel is truly beautiful, everywhere spotlessly clean and decorated and furnished grandly. Our room had a lovely view over the park. It was furnished beautifully but all the furniture was quite large and took up a lot of floor space which did make it a little cramped. Also the bed, which although very comfortable was extremely high making it quite difficult for my petite mum to get on and off easily without some help. However the very many thoughtful touches and the lovely large bathroom with a plentiful supply of toiletries made it a very comfortable and pleasant stay.   "
February 2019,Magnificent Experience,"First of all, I must admit I am biased to spending time in the RCH Collection of hotels as each has it's own distinct and glamorous experience.  I was staying at Summer Lodge in Evershot and met a lovely couple who recommended the Milestone and I had yet to stay there so I was able to make a reservation at the last minute and the last room and I was so delighted for so many reasons.  It was truly a priviledge to be able to spend two nights at this magnificent hotel with the finest doorman I have ever met who welcomes you with open arms and then you are whisked away to reception where Noola and Tara are there to greet you with warmth and  friendly hospitality.   The team makes you immediately feel at home and nothing is too small or large for them to accommodate. They are so‚Ä¶"
February 2019,A London Gem,"I recently had the opportunity to stay at The Milestone Hotel in London. Having heard about it I was eager to experience to for myself. Located in Kensington, going forward The Milestone Hotel will be my go to property in London. Each and every member of the staff knows your name and the service they deliver is superb. Greeted upon arrival by the Bellmen Stephen or Patrizio, we were made to feel like we had arrived home.  The Concierge Desk is the most professional I have ever worked with and they are indeed knowledgeable about the all things London whether it be transportation, dining or theatre. Shout out to Giacomo, Jose and Timothy( I hope I haven't forgotten anyone). Each morning we were greeted in the dining room by Eleanor who went out of her way to make sure we were‚Ä¶"
January 2019,A Royal Palace well beyond expectations!,"When I generally go to a hotel with a very high ranking, I simply expect that something has to go wrong as I generally believe the grading of my fellow travellers to be way too generous, instead my preconception went completely wrong with Milestone! Everything from the booking, to the special requests, the stay, the staff, the room, the view, the breakfast in the room, the sauna and the gym, all  was simply stunning and perfect!!!! I have no words a just felt like a royal myself! Anyway trying to be a bit managerial and a little bit less carried on by the emotions, I think this management has taken the strategic choice to have a higher number than average of staff and that has as a  first consequence the ability to deliver such a spotless service!  More importantly everybody is‚Ä¶"
February 2019,Special gem of hotel,Wonderful celebration stay at this gem of a hotel in central London!  The team were so helpful and the room was just lovely and comfortable - we all had a fabulous time and night out at the Royal Albert Hall - just along the road - seeing cirque de soleil Totem - very special experience for all - just 10/10 ! 
November 2018,Valentines ,"My other half booked us a night here to celebrate Valentine‚Äôs Day ;) wd went to see cirque du Soleil .... ( not their best show ) but it didn‚Äôt matter as the hotel was exquisite !! Room was fabulous , best hotel bed we‚Äôve ever stayed in ... just immaculate with gorgeous decor and crisp sheets ... decor was of high standard throughout and the staff are amazing !! Can‚Äôt fault a thing . We will be back but for longer than a night !! Great location !! Highly recommend. "
February 2019,Friendly Boutique Luxury.,"I do like to sample new hotels when I stay in London and have been looking at the Milestone for a while. It is wonderfully situated for the shopping on Knightsbridge, Kensington Gardens or the Road Albert Hall. It is small enough to be quite intimate yet large enough to feel like a proper hotel. The rooms are quite small but well appointed and the staff really feel like a big family and do seem to care quite genuinely about the hotel and this is reflected in an excellent level of personal service. The restaurant is small and cosy. We didn't dine but had an excellent breakfast. We were here in November '18 and liked it so much we re-booked for January '19."
February 2019,A wonderful return visit,We stayed here last year and it became our home away from home in London. The hotel is lovely but what takes it to the next level is the people and the service. Everyone knows your name and the warm greetings are sincere. Nothing is too much trouble. Do not miss the Stable Bar!!! A big shout out to my bartender buddies. See you again next year!
January 2019,"They deserve 6 stars! Amazing, warm, nice and professional hotel.","I stayed for a long weekend at the Milestone Hotel for my 50th birthday. Service was spectacular from reservations (thank you Celene) to the concierge (Giacomo who knows the city by heart and has endless patience) and the staff everywhere including Leo and the ladies at the restaurant. I decided to fly on my own and was received warmly. Little treats and a cake expected me in my room (gorgeous and tasty). The experience was fabulous from beginning to end. The hotel is clean, impeccably run - I was asked at to my experience and feedback repeatedly. Last but not least - upon check out I was given a sweet bag of biscuits and a bottle of water for the journey. This clearly proves attention to details. The only challenge I had as a foreigner was that I really did not know how to tip‚Ä¶"
May 2019,Milestone Hotel in London,"We stayed at Milestone hotel for four nights.  We were very impressed with the hospitality and the service we received.  The rooms were fabulously done, and the service was excellent.  The staff all knew us by name, and they went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. They serviced the room twice a day and replenished all the toiletries and left chocolate on the bed every night. Breakfast was included with our room and had a great variety of choices in a buffet style but we also had an option of ordering from a menu (without charge). They also had complimentary drinks when we arrived.  I would highly recommend this hotel whether for pleasure or business. It is very accessible to public transportation (both by bus and tube) and walking distance to many shops.  You‚Ä¶"
April 2019,Well cared for ,"I can not say enough good things about this hotel. I would never stay anywhere else in London. Not only is the hotel beautiful and In an excellent location but it‚Äôs the staff that make you feel welcome and cared for.  Our trip was riddled with airport cancellations, lost important baggage and an event that had tickets delivered prior to our arrival. They changed our reservations easily to accommodate or day late arrival. Greeted us when we checked in with such kindness and caring. When luggage was lost the whole staff stepped in to help us. They went above and beyond in assisting us.  Besides the amazing staff and location, the amenities were wonderful. The fitness center, pool, restaurant on site, bar, were enjoyed. The treats in the room were delicious.  I can not thank the‚Ä¶"
May 2019,Best stay in London ,"This boutique hotel is next to the Kensington Palace and has a long history. The decorations are tasteful and also have clear but subtle connection to London itself, including sketches out the Matisse era and paintings of horse racing and tennis game. Occasionally the royal family may come to afternoon tea or dinner. The service is excellent and the concierge desk was very friendly and truly wanting you to have a good time. They helped us planned most of our activities during our stay. The afternoon tea was the best, period. We also enjoyed the daily breakfast - the variety, quality, and service all made a top experience. It‚Äôs a place we want to go back again. We had a studio room featuring Matisse sketches and paintings. Everything contributed to an experience that is rich in‚Ä¶"
April 2019,Afternoon tea experience ,"I enjoyed Afternoon tea as solo traveler and what can I say - staff was very welcoming and caring, atmosphere and interior send me a few centuries back in the past and created a needed feeling, and the tea, sandwiches and all sweet cakes were excellent, only problem - too much to try everything üòä"
April 2019,Fantastic hotel and staff,My family and I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights. The hotel is immaculate and the staff are wonderful .  The breakfast was great !  We felt as though we were home being away from home .The rooms are decorated with beautiful Furniture and drapes . The bed linens were wonderful  as well as the bath towels. I have traveled to many places and this is the nicest hotel I have been in . The location is great . The staff was always there to help in anyway .  I would highly recommend ‚ÄúThe milestone ‚Äú!  They also have a small resistance pool in the work out area . My 6 year old granddaughter loved it . You were able to turn on the resistance button or Keep  it as a regular pool.  I would look into this hotel if you  are planning  on going to London L.B  from New Jersey .
March 2019,"Beautiful Hotel, Amazing Service","The Milestone Hotel sets a high standard for service anywhere in the world.   From the person at the door when you arrive with your luggage, who actually seems to be expecting you, to the women who beautifully clean the rooms and leave treats on your bedside, we felt warmly welcomed and pampered by all.  We stayed in standard rooms, which were a nice size and had every amenity you could need.   My request for adjacent rooms was accommodated with no problem.  The beds were very comfortable.  The hotel is in an excellent location, right across from the park and near several Tube stations.  I will definitely return to the Milestone Hotel."
April 2019,Amazing stay,"We stayed here to celebrate our Silver Anniversary. We where very lucky in receiving an upgrade, which was a beautiful split level suit. We attended an event at The Royal Albert Hall, and on returning, spent some time in the bar, then when returning to our room it had the most beautiful romantic turndown, candles and rose petals everywhere. Breakfast amazing, and we dined in the restaurant one evening, which was lovely, great food and staff very friendly. The following two nights of turndowns, where more simple, just a couple of chocolates in a bag on the bed. The only minor niggle, which we didn't report, was that we used a tall tumbler for water on the first day, it disappeared and we never saw it again! Our 2nd night, we had scones left in the room, and while the napkins‚Ä¶"
April 2019,Fantastic experience,"The Sabrage experience was amazing followed by a superb lunch, all of the staff were great but David went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed the whole experience.  Just fantastic day out, if you get chance to do this please do"
April 2019,The Best Stay,"We were privileged to stay at the Milestone for five days during our visit to London. The staff is professional, super friendly, and extremely well trained--whether at the front desk, at tea, in the restaurant, at the bar, the doorman, concierge and housekeeping staff. We were so well taken care of, we didn't want to leave. Our junior suite room was clean, plenty spacious with a view of Kensington Palace and the park"
April 2019,Service with a smile,"Couldn‚Äôt fault either the accommodation or the catering, but we were particularly aware that the smiles which accompanied the service were perfectly genuine and could not just be a requirement of a 5* hotel."
February 2019,Perfect,"This was the best hotel ever.  it was brilliant,  luxurious and it was so clean and tidy.   the staff was fantastic and friendly. Outstanding property located directly across from Kensington Gardens. The entire staff was simply incredible... made us feel at home and welcome... quick with a ‚Äòhello‚Äô and a smile... and always accommodating. "
January 2019,Defines excellent service,"All those excellent reviews are well deserved. What makes this hotel truly standout is service - everyone is really coming out of their way to be helpful, and management has very well thought-through additional amenities and offers (e.g in flight picnic, help with flight arrangements etc). The property itself is a fine historical building, rooms are pretty though on a smallish side (as it always is in downtown London)."
December 2018,The best London hotel that I've stayed in....by a distance!,"I've stayed in dozens of hotels in London and hundreds around the world....mainly 5* and mainly the upper end of that.  What makes this hotel special is the staff. They are superb. The hotel is gorgeous, very comfortable, has that old-world feel but all the modern gadgets that you need and has some incredible history to boast about, but the staff go the extra mile and then a lot, lot further.  I mentioned that my rugby team was playing on the Friday evening and I got a good luck card with a ""Rugby Bible"" in my room a few hours later. Incredible.  The boys in the small but incredibly cosy bar were superb. Top marks.  The hotel's butler was simply a great source of info and an incredible host. Top marks too.  The staff in the restaurant (both I spoke to were Polish) were great‚Ä¶"
February 2019,Lunch,"Absolutely fantastic hotel, run by people who care about their guests and love their jobs.  A brilliant place to come and be looked after.  We had lunch in a private dining room that has been used by several of the royals!, "
January 2019,Amazing afternoon tea and wonderful staff,"My friend and I went to The Milestone yesterday afternoon and I just had to write about the exceptional service we received from our server Eleanor. She was knowledgeful, polite, informative and could not have done more. As my friend is a vegetarian and I am not, they organised a fully vegetarian stand for us both to pick from, and separated any non-vegetarian sandwiches on to a separate plate. Amazing food, all incredibly tasty and what you cannot finish is boxed up and given you to to take with you. Overall a wonderful experience, with special thanks to Eleanor"
January 2019,Absolutely the best overall high tea in London,"My 22 yo daughter and 18 yo son took our first ever trip to London and my daughter's request was to have high tea.  The Milestone was near our hotel and although it was a huge splurge for a single parent like me, it was absolutely, hands down the high tea experience of a lifetime and one of our favorite meals in London.  Even my 18yo son, who rolled his eyes when I told him we were going, walked away wanting to return, which is no small feat! From the moment you walk in the door, you are impressed with the quiet elegance of this gorgeous, historic hotel.  The library is the perfect backdrop for the most delicious tea service I've ever had, excellent pastries and scones, but the chicken salad sandwiches are simply to die for!  I would be remiss not to mention the incredibly‚Ä¶"
January 2019,Caring staff,"The hotel felt luxurious, comfortable, personal, interesting, the list goes on and on. Most noticably for us, the staff were attentive, personable and couldn't do enough for us. The afternoon tea was delightful and Thomas who served us was absolutely charming. Breakfast was in a light, attractive room where the fire was lit. Again, the staff were personable but not over the top. The Stirrups Bar was cosy and we completely forgot we were in the centre of London."
January 2019,Perfect location for the Albert Hall,"We stayed for one night at this  lovely hotel as we were visiting the Albert Hall for a show. It was a straight, easy, flat 10 minute walk from this hotel. It‚Äôs a great location just opposite the wonderful Kensington palace and park. Our room was pleasant even though the decor was a little dated and we faced the back not the park. The small gift and the box of biscuits were a nice touch. The bathroom was very well done and the bed very comfortable.We were very impressed with the young and enthusiastic staff who looked after us so well during our stay. We particularly felt the bar staff were so professional and pleasant when we went for pre show drinks. Later on  when we arrived with our family after the show  there was a lone barman . He was both knowledgeable charming and‚Ä¶"
January 2019,The best hotel in London,Every time I visit ‚Äî it‚Äôs like coming home. Best staff. Amazing food. Best tea in London. Cross the street and visit Kensington Palace. I‚Äôve stayed here on business and with my family and it always inspires. 
January 2019,Just fantastic ,"We were here for our wedding anniversary, for the second time, and were really spoiled by the staff and management again. Last year, owing to works, we had to move to the sister hotel - Egerton House so we have an idea about both. In my opinion The Milestone wins hands down. You‚Äôre made welcome at both but The Milestone just seems to fit like a favourite sweater and we feel so very comfortable the whole time we‚Äôre there. I doubt we‚Äôd stay anywhere else."
April 2019,Fantastic experience made entirely from the staff,"I do not normally write reviews, but a one night stay at the Milestone deserves all the praise for an exceptional service. From the moment we arrived we felt like every member of staff REALLY cared, they were informative and enjoyed a fun banter showing interest in us and the reason for our stay. Afternoon tea served by the delightful Eleanoir, was only to pleased to accommodate the request of a marmite sandwich and green pea sandwich, only as fun but the chef duly obliged round of applause for keeping the customer happy. The hotel states that it aims to provide rooms and accessories as a ‚Äúhome from home‚Äù which they achieve in abundance. Cannot praise the staff enough thank you each and everyone"
September 2018,"""Royal Treatment""",A long overdue thank you to the amazing staff at The Milestone Hotel.  Visited with my Mom for a wedding and we were given the royal treatment to make us feel special. Would recommend highly.  Five Stars and then some.
April 2019,Great Experience,"My wife and I spent several days there last September.  Having never been to the Milestone (or London, for that matter), we had no idea what to expect.  The hotel was lovely, and the staff couldn't have been nicer.  Our room was on the small side, but it was well appointed, and the bathroom was large and very modern.  The bar area was a little cramped, but the overall comfort, the food and the service more than make up for it.  The location was perfect.  We could easily walk to the many parks nearby, or catch a cab and quickly be just about anywhere in the city.  As previously mentioned, the staff was wonderful, and always quick to answer questions and give advise to first time visitors.  We can't recommend The Milestone highly enough."
March 2019,Lovely Hotel,"This lovely hotel covers all aspects from the moment you arrive. Every department is outstanding, from the doormen through to the meticulous housekeeping team. Our room, 303, was like a home away from home & we would particularly like to thank  Connor & Giacomo, the Concierges, Nik at reception & Sandra, Eleanor & Magda in Chenestons restaurant who welcomed us every morning & provided warm, friendly & professional service. We come from Australia & always choose this hotel to come to after a long journey. For us it is perfect."
February 2019,Perfection,"My wife and I recently concluded a five night stay at the Milestone and wanted to share our experience.  As soon as we arrived we could feel the sincerity in their welcoming manner.  The doormen were attentive and personable and check in was smooth.  We were met by the guest relations manager Peggy who showed us around the hotel and who throughout our stay was always helpful and cheerful, feeling more like a good friend to us than a typical manager.  Our room was wonderfully well appointed.  The location of the hotel across from Kensington Park was ideal and the hotel‚Äôs breakfast was a great way to start our day‚Äôs adventures.  The concierge Giacamo and Jose were always very helpful.  I can‚Äôt express how wonderful everyone was and how much we look forward to our next stay at the‚Ä¶"
February 2019,Best Kept Secret in London,"My only disclaimer is that The Milestone isn‚Äôt a total ‚Äúsecret‚Äù. I see plenty of 5-Star reviews for this outstanding property on Trip Advisor, but when one speaks to friends about hotels in London, there just aren‚Äôt that many people who are familiar with it. Most Americans stay at familiar chains, you know, the big ones. The Milestone is a part of the Red Carnation group of 5-Star hotels in the UK and Europe. It is also a member of the ‚ÄúLeading Hotels of the World‚Äù.   This was my first time at The Milestone and was recommended to me by my brother who is in the travel industry. From the moment I entered the lobby to check-in, it was obvious that this is a truly special place. There is no glitz, just a highly refined, very British, well run hotel that immediately became my home‚Ä¶"
April 2019,Great hotel in excellent location,"Wonderful service, excellent onsite restaurant, and very comfortable and spacious rooms. A few minutes walk from the subway station and many restaurants and shops; steps away from a bus stop. Great view of the Kensington Gardens, which are just across the street."
March 2019,Always five stars,"I have stayed at the Milestone on multiple occasions, on business and pleasure and with family and by myself.  The location,rooms and amenities are excellent.  The staff are the best.  They go out of their way to look after you and make your stay memorable.  If you want personalized attention, responsiveness and an overall great experience choose the Milestone."
March 2019,Best Value in Town,i went with a friend and stayed at the Milestone for 5 nights!!! yes it might be more than you would usually pay But what you get for your money is far above the less expensive hotels. just the quality of the people and their willingness to help and be accommodating is worth the price of admission. Jose & his concierge crew are really priceless. they assisted us in getting play tickets and restaurant reservations and recommendations (which were right on the money) i got home and couldn't stop telling my husband how wonderful our stay was at the Milestone. the breakfasts-the beautiful bar-the pickup service from and to the airport- and on & on--Now my husband is upset he didn't come too!! treat yourself and stay here-- great location as well!!!
March 2019,Very good but there are areas for improvement. Overpriced for what you pay for. It certainly wouldn‚Äôt be my perfect hote,"The hotel, the staff, the restaurant were excellent the room service was appalling. The hotel was very good, the reception with the the exception of one girl whose English was not good were excellent. The bar staff, the restaurant staff, the housekeeping staff were all excellent, however on arrival we were offered coffee etc. We accepted the coffee as we were unpacking our clothes etc however after half an hour after unpacking our coffee still had not arrived. We rang and requested the coffee be delivered to the bar finally after about ten minutes the coffee arrived in the bar. On Saturday evening after having a few drinks in the bar we went to our room and requested coffee in our room again we were told it was going to be about 45 minutes. - Not acceptable!! It was 11.00pm on‚Ä¶"
December 2018,The perfect stay,"This small but ‚Äúperfectly formed‚Äù hotel provides home from home luxury. Personal & friendly, with the correct amount of professionalism. An oasis of calm & style. We cannot recommend it highly enough."
January 2019,"One week trip to London, filled with sight seeing and exploring.","Our stay at the Milsetone Hotel exceeded our expectations! The entire staff was so welcoming and helpful. The Concierge staff was superb. Our room was comfortable and very well appointed.  Breakfast each morning was perfect with a wide assortment. We had dinner one night at the hotel and it was a delicious meal with exceptional service. The location of the hotel was a definite plus. We were within short walking distance to the underground railway, nice restaurants, shopping, Hyde Park and Kensington Palace We recommend this highly and are looking  forward to going back. We cannot say enough positive about the Milestone Hotel and they way we were treated."
December 2018,Magical!,"We stayed here for a week over the Christmas period. Truly a magical stay. The hotel per se is lovely but it is the service which makes it world class. The whole staff goes the extra mile to make your stay a memorable one. Special mention to the bar staff.  Rooms are of high standard, food is excellent, gym/spa area is small but functional. Lots of little treats such as chocolate were offered to us each day, and we also received Christmas presents! Thanks to all and can‚Äôt wait to be back! "
December 2018,"Great Hotel, Outstanding Staff and Incredible Location!","We stayed at The Milestone Hotel from 22-26 December for a Christmas break in London and the facility and staff truly exceeded our expectations. The hotel's location, directly across from Kensington Gardens, was incredibly convenient. Our room (305) was spacious, quiet and very comfortable (kudos for one of the best hotel mattresses we've ever experienced). Hats off to Steve, Pedro, Magda, Patricio, Raul, Mathilde, Tara and the rest of the Milestone team for making us feel incredibly welcome and 'at home' during our stay."
December 2018,"Cozy, Convenient, and Convivial","A small hotel on High Street Kensington on the southwest edge of Kensington Gardens offers convenience to the parks, tube station, and posh shopping.  The atmosphere is more like ""home"" than ""hotel.""  Yes, rooms are small by American standards, but more than adequate and are in excellent condition. The service staff are very friendly, responsive, and attentive.  For example, I bought a book, laid it on my bedside table - the turn down service inserted a Milestone bookmark for my convenience.  Each evening a new taste treat was laid on our pillows.  A newspaper started each day. During our stay we both had a bout of stomach bug - the staff responded with medications, ginger ale and ice without our asking.  The restaurant and bar have a strong menu for such a small property.  We‚Ä¶"
December 2018,Beautiful afternoon tea ,Gorgeous afternoon tea home made scones and pastries. Fab choice of teas and lanson champagne all in a stunning setting next to Kensington palace what more can you ask for! Restaurant looks smashing too. 
December 2018,Great service but spa disappointing ,Old fashioned charm of an English Hotel. It was very cold in London when I visited and the down stairs area were not warm. The Spa area is a disappointment and the bar was small and quirky. The service and friendliness of the staff was memorable. 
December 2018,Most wonderful hotel. ,"I agree with all the great reviews.  The Milestone is several cuts above the others.  The hotel is lovely, rooms very smartly appointed, etc.  But it is the staff and the little things which really set this apart.  From the moment you walk into the beautiful lobby, everyone calls you by name.  They not only tell you where to get the bus but walk out the front door to show you.  The sweets on the pillow are different every night.  The small gifts upon arrival, the welcome cocktail, the wonderful bar tenders who explained the fancy drinks they were making, the wonderful breakfast ( included and fabulous), the twice daily total maid service- everything is above first rate.  Don‚Äôt miss tea by the fire, champagne in the bar, or the lighted candle on the bathtub at night.  All‚Ä¶"
December 2018,"'No request too large, no detail too small'","My fianc√© and I came to stay for one night and we had one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had. This quaint, cosy hotel offered tiny details at every turn and, at Christmas anyway, we felt as if we were staying in a perfect little dolls' house!  We were offered a glass of bubbles upon arrival, and the check in (and out) service was quick and efficient and the staff were extremely warm and helpful. Fortunately, our room had been upgraded and we were given a suite with a corner sofa living area. Looking at my photos, you would've thought we were there for many nights, but all of these tiny touches were placed in our room and throughout the hotel within one night! The bed was comfortable and I had a lovely bubble bath!  We were out at an event in the afternoon, but we‚Ä¶"
October 2018,Warm and welcoming luxury - fantastic!,"We stayed for 1 night in a junior suite (The Viscount Suite) and it was without doubt one of my best hotel experiences ever.  Some of the highlights:  + The Viscount Suite is stunning; beautifully furnished and decorated, spacious and with lovely views of Kensington Palace. The four-poster bed was fantastic. Several seating areas.  Beautiful paintings. There was also a big group of orchids. Huge TV. Snacks/nibbles provided for arrival and after turn-down.  + Excellent staff, especially the doormen and in the bar. We were always addressed by name by the doormen throughout our 1-night stay, very impressive. Everyone always met us with a smile and a very warm approach.  + I had quite a few parcels sent to the hotel in advance of our stay. This was handled perfectly.  + Top-quality‚Ä¶"
December 2018,Family hotel,"This is the best hotel i stayed in my life, all the staff in the hotel are very friendly and they welcome you when you arrive at the hotel. you feel like home, i always feel that i am at home with the family. Its both a family and a business trip hotel. all the staff treat you as a person not as a number in the hotel. and they always try to help you if you have any issues. i recommend if you go to London to stay at the milestone hotel. the hotel is like a 7 star hotel, and is always the best."
November 2018,Fabulous boutique hotel ,"My husband and I just checked out of The Milestone Hotel and I wanted to evaluate it on TripAdvisor as it deserves a fabulous review.  If you‚Äôre the type of person who appreciates the personalized attention and old fashioned, traditional and more formal atmosphere that a boutique hotel has to offer, search no further. This hotel will be perfect for you. And, it‚Äôs location in Kensington is wonderful and convenient.  Our hotel room was extremely well appointed and immaculate. The bathroom was large although our queen sized bed and bedroom were on the small side. But, it was sufficient for our needs and the extreme attention to details and services far outweighed the size of our room.  I honestly cannot say enough wonderful things about this hotel and it‚Äôs staff -especially Tim,‚Ä¶"
November 2018,"Health club with Fiona Keane- BEST TREATMENT EVER- jet lag treatment, TRY IT!","This November I had the opportunity to stay at the Milestone alongside my husband over Thanksgiving. The Milestone was a magnificent choice to stay during the holidays, it was cozy, we were well taken care of, and the William and Kate residence is BEAUTIFUL.  The stag was extreme moly helpful and accommodating, even booking us last minute reservations when our fell through on Thanksgiving.  My favorite experience with the hotel was actually the SPA! This was only a 4 1/2 day trip for myself and I was handling the jet lag alright, but my skin was dry and of course my body a little exhausted. I noticed there was a full jet lag treatment which all hotels seem to offer, but I thought why not, it‚Äôs a holiday...  This. Was. INCREDIBLE. I actually should have reviewed sooner, but I‚Äôll‚Ä¶"
December 2018,Cannot speak highly enough,"My girlfriend and I initially visited the hotel in early November. Despite having to wait only minutes for our room to be available, we were offered a free drink of our choosing whilst we waited. Nice touch!  After we'd checked in and started to enjoy our stay, I sadly received an urgent phone call regarding the health of a family member. It was so urgent we had to leave immediately having only been at the hotel for perhaps an hour or so. The receptionist (Peggy) and the rest of the staff were extremely understanding and efficient with how they helped us depart. So much so, they didn't charge us for the stay and allowed us to use the night at a later date at no extra charge. Wonderful service.  We rearranged the night for a month or so later, and as to their word allowed us a‚Ä¶"
November 2018,Great hotel fab location ,"What a delight to stay here. The staff, decor, room, all perfect. We stayed in the sister hotel 41 recently as it was voted no 1 hotel to stay on trip advisor and we found this far better. Great location for exploring, lovely afternoon tea too. We would def stay here again "
December 2018,"Our special ""home"" in London",We love this hotel.  What a very special place.  We are made to feel so welcome by all the staff and this special care continues throughout our stay.  The bedrooms and suites are all unique and everything about them is first class - from the bedding to the amenities to the room service and housekeeping.  We never want to leave.  The breakfasts are amazing - anything you could possibly wish for and we also enjoy dining in the restaurant for lunch or dinner. We are looking forward to returning next Summer.
December 2018,Another PERFECT visit. Attention to detail still impressive,"We were at the Milestone back in May of this year and we just could not wait to return. This time we brought along some friends to see this charming hotel with world class service. As always, this hotel never disappoints. Service and charm is consistent and world class. There are a lot of lovely 5 star, triple diamond hotels around but then, there is this hotel, the Milestone. ""World class"" is still not good enough to describe the hotel and the people who work there. The attention to detail is so scary, I love it! Just amazes me how the staff do what they do on a day to day basis. Special shout out to Giacomo and Angelo who were the bartenders when I was there in May and is still there today. They are just AMAZING and I love just talking to them and getting to know them. We so‚Ä¶"
October 2018,Amazing hotel,"One of the best I have ever visited. Very clean rooms, amazing food quality and most important the most welcoming staff. Amazing location facing the Hyde Park.  It simply makes you feel home away from home. "
December 2018,Perfect in every way,"I stayed at The Milestone with my parents and brother. All of the employees greeted us by name and made us feel so welcome and comfortable. Each of the rooms had unique decor, but always lovely. The breakfast was truly a stand out. It is served in a beautiful fireplace room and nearly everything you could imagine was available on the menu. I really enjoyed everything about our stay at this quintessential British hotel!"
December 2018,Spectacular!,"Outstanding customer service, beautiful surroundings and delicious food, what more could you wish for from a hotel?   We hosted an evening wedding and reception in the Milestone Hotel and everything was truly magical, we really couldn‚Äôt wish for anything more.    Our every need was catered for and nothing was too much trouble. All members of staff were professional, helpful and friendly.   Celene, our contact from initial enquiry and throughout the preparations was a dream to work with and organised everything to perfection.   Another key member of the team was Leo Forte, a charming man who will go far in the hospitality industry, he ensured everything ran smoothly on the night and was on hand the following morning to assist with the departure of our guests from the hotel.  ‚Ä¶"
November 2018,Exceptional hotel,"What do you want from a hotel? Think really hard, close your eyes, make a wish, tap your heels together three times and, hey presto, The Milestone appears in front of you.   There‚Äôs nothing I can add to other positive reviews. This is simply the best hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed in. Good, old-fashioned customer service at its finest. Treat yourself. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. Exceptional."
November 2018,Great stay at a marvellous hotel!,"My wife and myself went to London one week ago to first (my wife‚Äôs choice) look at a musical (Wicked - which was very good in fact) and then Spurs vs Inter at Wembley on Wednesday (great game - fantastic team ....) - my choice...   And we stayed at the Milestone hotel, it was absolutely first class - all the way. Very nice rooms, great food, lovely and pleasant staff! Surpassed by no one! We will love to come back - and even the door man was very nice even though his favourite team (Liverpool - poor guy) lost that evening - while my (extremely splendid) team Spurs won .... "
November 2018,Wonderful Stay at The Milestone Hotel,"The Milestone Hotel is a ""must stay"" for a traveler to London. It is a quaintly British hotel that is beautifully decorated to reflect its character. That in itself is reason to book this hotel; yet, the service and hospitality of the entire staff are what sets this hotel head and shoulders above any others we have experienced. From their greeting at our arrival, we were pampered with congenial room service (no extra charge) and nightly turn-downs with sweets tucked on our pillows, welcomed guidance from the concierge and yes, the doorman. Everyone was so friendly and so genuinely interested in making our trip to London a memorable one. The Milestone anticipates its guests' every need. They want your stay to be exceptional and ours was! Beyond the superior hospitality, the food‚Ä¶"
November 2018,Enjoyable Stay,"Very accommodating staff, friendly and courteous. Was staying here for 2 nights and it was a wonderful experience. Though it was a tiring day for me bu this place makes me feel relaxed and comfortable."
November 2018,"Classy, classic and warm with outstanding service","Upon arrival, we (three families) were greeted with a smile and courteous, efficient and friendly front of house staff. The room was very nice, and we had an adjoining room for our kids which was also lovely. Everything about the hotel, from rooms to furnishings and art around the hotel, oozes class. Nothing was too much trouble for the team there and this seems to be at the core of the Red Carnation group's values. Breakfast was lovely and it was intriguing to see how popular the English afternoon tea was as early as 1pm - it did look impressive and authentic.  The Royal Albert Hall is within walking distance as are shops and Kensington Park is the other side of the road - I had a lovely walk through. If you like modern, tech-friendly (the WiFi was good) automated hotels, this‚Ä¶"
November 2018,Brilliant and super experienced Fiona at the Health Club and Great authentic experience,"I was staying in The Milestone for a week, greatly located! Prove a strong feeling of home and luxury care about guests.  Super experienced Fiona at the Health Club does excellent massage, bringing you in life back after busy week, highly recommended! "
November 2018,Always Brilliant,"Not missing a beat after a year's absence, I was greeted by name at the door and warmly welcomed back by the staff in the lobby.  Love the location across from the park and the wonderfully designed and comfortable suites, but it really is about the people.  Returning to my room from a run while it was being made up, the housekeeping staff immediately stopped what they were doing to provide me with a bottle of water.  When the concierge overheard me tell the door man that I left my phone at Selfridges, he was on the phone immediately trying to track it down.  My ritual of a nightly Negroni with the bar crew is like hanging with friends.  Just the best."
November 2018,Lazy afternoon,Intimate hotel that feels cozier than the Baglioni nearby. Nice afternoon tea service. Convenient location just near Kensington Garden. Multiple little cute spaces to have cocktails or tea. Worth the visit. 
October 2018,Prince Harry and Princess Megans escape digs from LA FROG (Prince in Training),"Prince Harry, and Megans escape digs: Prince Harry and Princess Megan, have a huge dilemma WHERE TO GO WHEN MUMS (Her Majesty the Queen of England) is away, well not spoiled for choice, The LA Girl who would be A Princess, and actually live happily ever after, chose our little Milestone Hotel to be ever so delighted with the same things this former LA boy ok FROG in Prince training delighted in.   1.  Sumptuous interiors, replete with so much charm it made me kind of gasp when I went in the front door. 2. Warm, friendly and filled with youth staff that still made me feel an air of surprising superiority and dripping in wealth.  YES I WAS REALLY WORKING MY BLUE BLAZER, and GOLD BUTTONS. 3. I remember someone once said first impressions are just important for those who experience‚Ä¶"
November 2018,One of the best afternoon teas I had.......,"One of the best afternoon teas I have had .....  We booked afternoon tea for my aunts 80th Birthday.  The tea was superb, the service was great and the staff helpful and friendly especially Jack and Sandra.  I would recommend a visit."
October 2018,Milestone Birthday Celebration,"I went with my daughters to celebrate two milestone birthdays and we couldn't have picked a more perfect spot.  The location, staff, rooms, amenities, turn-down treats, restaurant, bar, and, well, everything including the birthday cake that came from the hotel with balloons all made for a very memorable trip.  Our driver, Colin, all those at concierge and reception desk, and everyone else anticipated our needs and ensured that we were well taken care of.  We would highly recommend the hotel for anyone who wants to feel pampered."
October 2018,Welcome return to the finest place in town,"Stayed for a weekend last month and very pleased to see that everything was just as good as the previous visit. Staff are extremely courteous and welcoming and attention to detail is spot on. Enjoyed the champagne afternoon tea and there really is far too much to eat in one sitting - no problem, if you like, the staff will box any remainders for you and leave in your room. Everything was very pleasant and looking forward to returning when we next have to be in London."
September 2018,GOLDEN WEDDING CELEBRATION WEEKEND,"Two weeks ago we spent three nights at the Milestone Hotel celebrating our Golden Wedding Anniversary along with our close family.  We found that the hotel definitely lived up to its five star luxury rating, but being a relatively small boutique hotel we had much more personal service than one would have experienced at a larger more impersonal chain establishment.  The staff looked after us all from the moment we arrived to when we checked out.  The rooms were opulent and classically furnished, and the breakfasts were some of the best we have ever enjoyed in a hotel.   Our Celebration Dinner was lovely with our every need catered for including the likes and dislikes of our rather awkward five year old granddaughter.  Nothing was too much trouble for every member of staff.   Our‚Ä¶"
November 2018,Treated like Royalty,"Our stay at The Milestone Hotel and Residences was fabulous!  Upon arriving, we were greeted at the door, had a lovely check-in experience, and then received a personal tour of the hotel on the way to our room.  The room was breathtaking! The staff really went above and beyond to make us feel like royalty--even throwing in free drinks at the bar!  The bed was comfortable, the breakfast was delicious, and the personal touches were much appreciated.    The location is excellent!  We were within walking distance to shops, restaurants, Hyde Park, and Kensington Palace.  I can't say enough wonderful things about this hotel!!"
October 2018,50th Birthday Celebration,"Had an amazing stay. Hotel was of the highest calibre. Customer service and attention to detail were exemplary. Staff were very friendly, helpful and attentive. Would definitely recommend it and will be definitely returning."
July 2018,A special Weekend,We stayed at the Milestone Hotel for a long weekend to attend a concert at The Royal Albert Hell which is within a short walking distance as is Kensington Palace. From the moment my 2 friends and myself walked in we were made very welcome by the friendly staff. Our room was something special and there was nothing left that couldn‚Äôt be done to make our stay very comfortable and enjoyable. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were very clean. We experienced Afternoon Tea on one of the days and so happy we did. My friends and myself were treated like Princesses throughout and will definitely be back.
October 2018,A lovely and exclusive taste of old school London 5 star Hotel,"Staying at the Milestone is really like being at home, only more expensive. Rooms are of very good class, They differ in size and views but on both our stays we have been very happy. they are roomy with big bathrooms and a great feel to them. The bar and the restaurant are pleasant in all ways if not with a partyfeel. The staff are supernice and friendly in the bar especially. we watched World cup football in the bar with other guests. Very nice. Breakfast i top class but my only negative comment is that breakfast staff appear a bit unconcentrated, forgetting things and being a bit off a couple of them. Best is the Conciergeteam and frontdesk and bellboys/men. All with a fantastic friendly and happy approach to their job, to service and to their guests.  The location is good if‚Ä¶"
October 2018,Get pampered,"Great location: the parks (Kensington & Hyde Park), the restaurants of all kinds, in or out, the shopping even at lower prices( UniQLO,TKMAXX) the nearby tube. Greeted by name when you arrive, lots of smiles and they really care about you. Enjoy a real English breakfast in a former chapel. Order your own paper. Seat comfortably and order a night cup."
October 2018,Great hotel,"I spent 1 night at The Milestone Hotel in London in October. As I arrived, I was greeted by a very nice doorman, then checked in immediately into an upgraded room. It was a studio room, called Margaret Rose, with a charming decor and a splendid view of the park. When I wanted to go for a walk, the gentleman from the concierge helped me to find my way and recommended some good restaurants in the neighborhood. I also had a splendid breakfast (included in the room rate) and a wonderful traditional afternoon tea. I know there are many hotels in London, but this hotel and its staff were great to me in every way and I will return."
April 2018,Home from Home,This hotel is such a haven in the frantic city. The d√©cor is so homely and the staff are amazing seamlessly making sure every detail is attended to and they are all do friendly. Afternoon tea is a must and eating in Cheneston's restaurant is so relaxing and the food wonderful. Then you must have a cocktail in the Stables bar such a cosy space.
July 2018,Service 2nd to none,The attention to detail and personal service is what will bring us back. The front desk and bellmen remembered our names and what our plans were for the entire 5 days we stayed. The dinner was amazing at the restaurant and the room was very much 5 star.
July 2018,Trip down memory lane,"This was a much anticipated and long overdue return visit to this incredibly special hotel. It was a joy to find that everything was just as we remembered it - best described as a country manor house in the heart of London, full of olde world charm and impeccable hospitality. We couldn‚Äôt have wished or asked for more from our visit, with every effort to make our visit an enjoyable one - we have fallen in love with the Milestone all over again and cannot wait to return again very soon. A special THANKYOU goes out to Grant, food and beverages manager, whose genuinely warm welcome, generosity of time and attention to detail made our visit a truly memorable one. This is an absolute must for anyone wanting a fine dining experience with first class service in beautiful surroundings."
July 2018,Very Special High Tea,"My family had a very special high tea at the Milestone today. From the minute we walked in the door all the staff, especially Tim, made us feel so welcome. They went out of there way to ensure my daughter had a great time. The food and service was excellent. I would highly recommend to anyone!"
June 2018,Make you feel welcomed and comfortable,"The staff was very welcoming and professional.  Pedro and Jose went above and beyond their duties to accommodate, as did the rest of the staff.  Room was clean and comfortable, good location to walk around and see the sights!"
July 2018,Luxury in Abundance,"The Milestone hotel is a wonderful gem! Just across from Kensington Palace/gardens, you cannot ask for a better location, and within easy access to the tube to explore other areas in London. From the moment you arrive, you are treated like royalty. Your every need is anticipated by the staff before you even realize you have one. Our room was delightful, and every evening there was a little gift at turndown service. It's those small details that made our stay amazing. No 2 rooms are alike, they each have their own charm and personality, something I truly enjoy.  A huge thank you to Andres, Fran, Nik and Magda for going the extra mile, time and again to make our stay the best one yet in London. We will surely be back!"
February 2018,Amazing hotel and the perfect venue for an intimate wedding,"My wife and I decided the Milestone would be our perfect venue to get married in a small ceremony with our closest family. It didn't disappoint in any way. We have both stayed in top end hotels before but the service and genuine care taken by Milestone staff is unparalleled.  Everything was perfect on the day, all the little details they took care of made it a very special occasion. Every member of staff was brilliant, the food was amazing and the rooms were faultless. Every member of our families felt the same and none of us can speak highly enough of the service we received. We expected big things but even those were surpassed.  In short, whether it is for your wedding, a holiday or just a one-night stay, we highly recommend this wonderful hotel!"
February 2018,Lovely weekend in London,"I stayed here with my little girl on a half-term trip to London. The hotel is beautiful and the staff are simply the best. A nice added touch was that they all had learned our names and greeted us personally whenever we went in or out. We had high tea in the restaurant - one kids and one adult, though we could have probably both shared the children‚Äôs version and been stuffed! (They did helpfully box it all up and take it back to the room for later.) The cakes and little sandwiches are just amazing and we also did the cupcake decorating. The lady who helped us was very patient with my little girl, who wanted to make the tallest cupcake ‚Äòin the world‚Äô, which was quite a slow process. :) There are games and bits you can borrow from the hotel. I phoned down to ask for Scrabble and‚Ä¶"
July 2018,A great hotel,"I have stayed there twice, and it is a very good hotel. It is very well run with good service and an attentive staff.  It is also in an area with good walking to shops, restaurants, hair sales and even palaces :)"
July 2018,Absolutely outstanding,"I stayed here with my family after the hotel came highly recommended by my parents. I was extremely impressed with the service from the moment we walked in. We were greeted every time we walked in and out of the lobby. The building and the apartment were GORGEOUS, the amenities endless - not to mention the basket of treats and wine left by the hotel! The hotel is conveniently right across from Kensington Palace and Hyde Park, and down the street from a tube station and Royal Albert Hall. I left some items behind after returning to the states, and within an hour of calling the concierge, he had made arrangements to ship them back. I was blown away by the kindness and friendliness of all the staff; they always went above and beyond to make us feel safe and welcome. The staff even‚Ä¶"
June 2018,Simply the best,"We stayed here as a couple last fall and brought back our kids this summer so they could  also experience London and the tremendous Milestone. 6 of us, all adults stayed in the 3 bedroom residence, each with its own bathroom. BEAUTIFULLY decorated, comfortable and as always we were once again blown away by the incomparable service and staff. So lovely to have a small kitchen to use, and the lounge area was perfect to gather and enjoy each other's company after a long day of exploring. The location is absolutely perfect -  literally across the street from Hyde Park and Kensington Palace, 5 minute walk to the Tube station, and a comfortable walk to Royal Albert Hall and the V&A museums.Our breakfast each morning in the dining room was phenomenal. Even when there was one tiny‚Ä¶"
February 2018,There are Five Star Hotels than there is The Milestone Hotel,"Everyone that works in the hospitality industry should stay at The Milestone Hotel because that is how it is done.  From check in to check out this hotel is nothing short of outstanding.  The staff is pleasant and always willing to help assist you in any way to make your stay five stars. From the doormen to the front desk to the maid service everyone is professional and friendly and made me feel right at home.  Located close to the subway, Hyde Park and the legendary Royal Albert Hall this hotel is close to everything you need during your London visit.  I also ate at Cheneston's Restaurant and my meal was one that I will not soon forget.  I enjoyed my time in London and staying at The Milestone Hotel made it even more memorable."
February 2018,Seamless Boutique Service... Perfection,I stayed at The Milestone for the first time with a friend last week for a mini break in London and to attend the Fashion Week Festival. The first thing that you cannot deny is the outstanding service that the staff provide. Immediately I was greeted by doorman Steve with a 'Welcome Home' smile and conversation flowed with the Concierge and Front of House team from there.  I was shown around the hotel to familiarise myself with the facilities and was greeted with kindness by the GM Mr Pike. I believe it was a young girl called Penny or Peggy(!?) who showed me around and she was so gracious and enthusiastic about the hotel - it was the brief history lesson of the building and charming stories of the past that made you feel like you were part of something special.   My room was‚Ä¶
February 2018,Sets the standard for excellence,"Stayed here last weekend and had a terrific time. Hotel staff are exceptionally good. Room was very welcoming and well appointed and attention to detail was evident in all aspects. Had dinner on the Friday night - the dining room is very small but the food and the service were both top notch. Try the dover sole if its on the menu, it was superb.  If you have a car then use the NCP across the road at the Royal Gardens Hotel. Looking forward to returning again for another stay."
February 2018,Outstanding Customer Service,Stayed here 2/9/2018 for five nights truly a step above any other hotel I've stayed at. Will always be were I stay when I go to London. The entire staff here needs two thumbs up. See you all sooner then later.
February 2018,Best hotel that I have ever stayed in! Customer service was incredible!,"The Milestone is literally my favorite hotel that I have ever stayed in.  It is impossible to put the quality of their customer service and the beauty of their grounds into words.  They truly treat their guests like royalty. I recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a perfect London experience.  It is certainly pricey, but I found the higher prices to be worth the many benefits that come with staying at the Milestone.  They also run pricing promotions throughout the year!  Pros:  -There were countless memorable aspects of our stay at the Milestone, but if I had to pick, I would say that the employees at the hotel were the most memorable part of our vacation.  They were so welcoming and personable.  They were also so happy to do anything to help make our vacation more‚Ä¶"
February 2018,Simply the best Hotel in London,"Though I have travelled the world and stayed in many great hotels, never before have I been compelled to write a review. The hotel itself and even more so the staff were truly astonishing. If you ever wish to be treated like a King, then this is simply the only hotel in London for you. The staff paid such attention to every little detail and in such a subtle manner. Though there were many other guests. they truly made me feel like I was the only one. Many thanks for such a fantastic stay and rest assured I intend to be back many times in the future. Jim Murphy"
February 2018,Wonderful!,"My my 4 night stay here last week was fantastic, and the service was fantastic. The room was amazing and the room service impeccable. One evening I dined in the hotel restaurant which was most enjoyable and immersive & can highly recommend the scallop starter and venison mains.   The staff went out of their way to ensure I had  pleasant stay - even when I mentioned that I had back trouble and had to stretch regularly, they even left a yoga DVD and player in the room. Before I left they ensured I had a hot beverage (it was about 2 degrees outside). Very thoughtful.   The staff were as tentative as anywhere I've been... ever! Location is top notch and right across from Kensington park. All in all it was a delightful stay and would highly recommend this hotel."
February 2018,Service will leave you speachless!,"This hotel is simply incredible.  Was my mothers first time out of the country, and she accompanied me while I did some business.  Wanted her to have a real British experience, but never anticipated the greatness that is the Milestone. I've stayed at many 5 star hotels, and yet this one creates a new 10th star in my book.  Not only was every detail covered, but details I would never think of were covered.  EVERY staff member is amazing, but my mom fell in love with her bartender friend Angelo. Every staff member knew our names by the end of just the first day.  The details in service blew me away on our last night yesterday.  We were running short on time and I asked Jose and Connor where I could get my little guy at home a Paddington Bear without taking a train ride to‚Ä¶"
November 2017,Cosy elegance with first class service,"We had a fabulous stay. My wife and daughter were in London to see a show and the hotel helped to make the trip so much more special. The staff were all, without exception, superb, helpful and genuinely friendly. The room had a view over the park with Kensington Palace dominating. So much so we were inspired to visit the Diana exhibition there that morning. Lyla loved to be in the room where Queen Victoria was born, and another where she was told she was Queen.  The room was spacious and yet cosy. All the small touches which separate a truly exceptional hotel from a great one. The notes, the robes and slippers laid out, the treats. The supplied bedtime reading was a new and very charming perk. The sofa bed for our daughter was soft and huge, she was out like a light. I would‚Ä¶"
February 2018,Special Place,"The service here is just amazing. The hotel has so much character. After 1 day all the people that worked there knew my name and when I went back on a second trip, they remembered me. The breakfast is one of the best meals I had while in London"
October 2017,Valentines day,After travelling such amount of places... you find super quality hotel from London... We practically live in hotels for the past 3 years... and This place just went straight to the Top 3 We ever visited!! Amazing room.. incredible service and staff!! Highly recommend to visit! We will return for sure
November 2017,Well situated across from Kensington Palace. Great Service,"This was a lovely boutique hotel directly across from Kensington Palace. The staff was fabulous-almost too solicitous. My room was very, very nice with great amenities. Breakfast was terrific. The concierge was one of the best as he was knowledgeable as well as friendly. I would compare this hotel to some of the finest in London and rate it quite highly. My only ""beef"" was that my room was not ready for the early check- in that overseas guests need.  However, for a 100 pound upgrade there would be a room ready. I decided  to wait which was only for 30 minutes during which time they nicely gave me some coffee. I would recommend this hotel and I would certainly return. Very expensive."
November 2017,Afternoon Tea,"My family and I spent a couple of hours at this marvellous hotel. We arrived a little bit earlier by taxi, and was greeted by their doorman. Since we arrived ca 40 min earlier I asked him where the nearest pub was located. He told us not to bother with that one, but if we could make the effort of walking a couple of minutes he could recommend one. Then he said ‚Äúas a matter of fact I show you the way‚Äù Three minutes later we arrived at the pub, while showing us the way he told us a few interesting things about the neighbourhood. FIRST CLASS SERVICE! Btw the Afternoon Tea was excellent and the staff was top notch. Highly recommended. "
October 2017,beautiful boutique hotel,"We stayed here as an experience gift from my sister so we had a package with dinner and breakfast as well as a beautiful room for the evening.  The Milestone is a classic classy hotel. The room had one of the biggest tv's I've seen in a hotel for a long time, a comfy bed, nice bathroom with lovely toiletries and nice big towel."
October 2017,Heaven missed,"I don't visit London often...... big mistake...... I didn't revisit my favourite and stay at the Milestone Please don't make make the same mistake. There is only one hotel that offers beautiful individually appointed bedrooms, restaurants, relaxed areas, cloakrooms and even corridors!!! Staff who are chosen for their professionalism. One is made to feel soooo very welcome. Peggy, Connor and Tim on the welcome desk reminded me I had made such a HUGE mistake not staying with them.  My other favourite being d'Angleterre in Geneva. The Red Carnation Group have Service tapped Location, location.... easy for most things needed See you soon dearest Milestone"
October 2017,Warm ambiance and attentive staff to the smallest detail.,"The room is  an amazing Master Suite with lovely windows overlooking Kensington Park. The furniture is very warm and the amenities are perfect. The friendly, high standard of the staff and their attention to our needs is gratifying; making the Milestone our home for one week away from home."
October 2017,5 star hotel with a down to earth attitude ,"We stayed at the Milestone to go to the Royal Albert Hall. It was a five minute walk so very handy. The hotel itself was delightful. They had thought of every little detail, try the aromatherapy pillows they smell lovely. The staff were very friendly and helpful. It was a great hotel for a birthday surprise. Don't forget to ask for the tea tray! "
August 2017,Lovely!,"I stayed here when I spent four days in London. The hotel is beautiful and the staff is really nice and attentive. The room service and afternoon tea are great. The hotel is right near Kensington Palace and the Victoria and Albert Museum. The best part about the hotel is the food, especially the Belgian waffles and honey comb icecream. Stay here!"
October 2017,Amazing place and people,"What a wonderful hotel We had looked at other high end hotels in the area and chose the Milestone. Our room was wonderful and so cozy. Each room is unique and ours was a bi-level with great shower, tub and heated towel rack. The bed was super comfortable and they even set up a small bed for our 9 year old daughter. We all had beautiful robes waiting and they even had one for our daughter. Each day there was a nice treat on her bed for her. Great location. Another highlight was the staff. They knew who we were and they set up a special tea and dinner for our children. The bar staff were great and looked after us and got the ""cosmos"" perfected. I wish I could remember their names (two from Italy and one from Germany) We also loved the choice of beer. The one from Namibia was great‚Ä¶"
October 2017,Truly one of the best hotels in the world,"From the minute you arrive at The Milestone Hotel, you feel completely welcomed and happy.  The staff goes above and beyond to make you feel comfortable and well cared for.  This is a professionally run, deluxe hotel that will give you a 5 star experience.  Our room, the services, the staff, and the breakfast - everything was perfectly done.  Every time we entered our beautiful room, we felt like we were in an English country manor house and had been given the best room!  I would also like to add that the hotel had been particularly accommodating to us.  We did not originally book at The Milestone, but at a nearby hotel at which we had a very unpleasant experience.  Not only did The Milestone find us a room immediately but their welcoming atmosphere made us feel completely‚Ä¶"
September 2017,The Ultimate English experience,"When you go to England you want to have an English experience, right? Well, look no farther; this is it. Within minutes of checking in, every staff member knows your name. the room is large and yet cozy. The bar is charming and well stocked. Afternoon tea is classic and wonderful. Smashing!"
September 2017,Eight great days at the Milestone.,"This is a wonderful hotel. The staff is extraordinary and the location is great. I have now stayed in four different rooms here, and I must say each room is very different. The rooms are not large, and you may want to upgrade if you can. Be aware that some rooms have the en suite bathrooms down a flight of stairs. If this is inconvenient for you, I would suggest you tell them this in advance, since the hotel is often fully booked and if you don't mention it until later it may be difficult for them to accommodate you with a different room. But in my experience, they will go the extra mile to make your stay an enjoyable one. It is a great hotel."
September 2017,"Second Visit, Still Extraordinary","This was our second visit to The Milestone and it continues to exceed our expectations. The hotel is beautiful - we received a room upgrade and ended up in the Regency Suite - what a spectacularly gorgeous room! The room itself was beautifully appointed, and the bathroom modern and roomy. The rainwater shower is probably the best shower I've ever experienced! The food is delicious and we also had exemplary service at the bar. The Milestone is one of the best luxury hotels we've stayed in - we look forward to a third visit!"
September 2017,Joan,"I have never experienced this level of service! The staff anticipated every need and went beyond my expectations. The hotel is charming and sophisticated, and the staff is friendly and welcoming. Staying at The Milestone Hotel is an experience not to be missed. "
September 2017,Wonderful Two Nights in London,"Even though our stay was brief we thoroughly loved our time at The Milestone! It is probably a tie what my favorite thing about the hotel was - the staff, or the amazing and delicious Afternoon Tea. As far as service goes, everyone who worked at The Milestone was friendly, helpful, and went out of their way to make our time in London enjoyable. I especially loved chatting with Stephen who was hilarious, while Pedro and the Concierge (whose name I'm angry I can't remember) went out of his way to make recommendations of places for us to eat, and helped draw out easy routes on a map for us. And the Afternoon Tea! It was so delicious! So much food! Also the room was clean and cozy, the bathroom luxurious (great tub and mirror!) and room service delicious. Would love to stay again."
September 2017,"Beautiful hotel, sheer luxury","This is a beautiful boutique hotel, opposite Kensington Gardens. The area is fairly quiet for London, and access to public transport is excellent. My room was stunning, with lovely linens, a really comfortable bed, and a gorgeous bathroom. Breakfast and dinner in the restaurant were excellent. Where this hotel scores over many others of quality is, however, the level of service provided by the amazing staff. Every staff member I met was so helpful - nothing was too much trouble. I know where I'll be staying next time I'm in London!"
September 2017,Best Hotel in London,"I stayed a couple of days ago and I just LOVED the hotel. The staff is so helpfull and I loved the Safari Suite (cosi, you have the real impression of being in Africa!!). Spacious and I loved the patio bar to have a drink.  And the view to the parc was fantastic.  Will definitely come back on my next trips! Harmony"
September 2017,Extraordinary!,"This isn't just a hotel, its an experience! From the moment we exited the taxi from the airport we were greeted by name. ""Welcome Mr. and Mrs...""  Whether it was simply stepping off the elevator, entering the restaurant for our amazing breakfast every day, or simply coming back from a long day of exploring magnificent London, the staff welcomed us with a smile and warmth we frankly are not accustomed to in the states.  The service was beyond measure in every instance.  Truly cannot say enough about that.  The room was also warm and inviting, and the bathroom was lovely as well with very cushy towels and higher end toiletries.  (I appreciated the lighted magnifying mirror!). When we returned for the day the room had always been attended to and was spotless, and the turn down‚Ä¶"
August 2017,Practically perfect!,"We visited London for the first time, and stayed at the Milestone.  From the moment we stepped out of our cab, we were embraced by the kind and interested staff at the Milestone.  Frankly, I've never experienced hospitality like this in any hotel!  The staff really are interested in each visitor - ready to listen, help, offer advise, and generally do whatever it takes to make your stay perfect.  Even our chamber maid was charming and loving - full of cheer and concern that we were well cared for.  AND - our room was lovely, the bar was charming, the restaurant delicious (I recommend the Dover Sole...). I couldn't possibly recommend this hotel enough!  It's a little expensive, but totally worth the extra cost."
August 2017,Over-the-top Afternoon Tea!,"This review is solely regarding the amazing Afternoon Tea service at the Milestone Hotel. My husband and I were vacationing for the first time in London.  We wanted to experience an authentic Afternoon Tea.  A local person recommended this hotel's TEA which was elegantly served in a beautifully wood paneled library.  From the concierge to the waite servers, we received a royal welcome!  The food was splendid and all prepared ""in house"".  The service is essentially in 3 parts: sandwiches including a house special of chicken breast coated with crushed almonds, followed by warm scones (best I've ever tasted) served with homemade preserves and butter, and finished with at least 10 mini desserts that were as delicious as they looked!   The price was high but well worth it.  We were‚Ä¶"
September 2017,The perfect hotel!,"This was our second stay at the Milestone, and we loved it every bit as much as the first. The location is perfect, the hotel is beautiful, the rooms luxurious and the breakfasts are among the best we've ever eaten, but what really sets the Milestone apart is the staff. We hadn't been back in London for a few years, but we were welcomed back like family and we were amazed at how many people remembered us. It really was like going home. Everyone was warm, gracious and accommodating, and we were treated like royalty. We wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else in London and promise not to wait so long until our next visit."
October 2017,Amazing aperitivo,My girlfriend and I have been at the stables bar for a pre dinner drink. Lovely atmosphere and wonderful cocktails! Angelo never stops to surprise with his concoctions. The canapes were deliiiiicious!! We will def be back!
December 2016,I love this hotel,"I seriously love this hotel. I was able to stay here one night back in 2011 and I swore to myself I'd be back one day. Well this year I was able to come back for an entire week to celebrate my second anniversary with my husband. We had such a magical week in London and most of that comes from staying in this hotel. The location is fantastic, the room spacious (We got a Deluxe Studio), and the service perfect. Both my husband and I just can't say enough about this place. Everyone's very helpful and accommodating. It's simply the best place to stay in London. Highly recommend."
September 2017,Britain's traditional Hotel by Excellence ,"This is a magical Hotel, my family has been traveling to this hotel for many years.  The topical English place to have the best stay in the British way.  The afternoon tea, the bar , the Restaurtant the typical English scenery. Right in front of the park.   If you want to enjoy a Hotel in London, this is it.    Don't miss the best traditional style.   "
October 2017,Immerse yourself in true British tradition,"This is a 5 star boutique hotel with a long and interesting history since its original construction in the early 1800's. It is utterly British, charming and dedicated to your service. All the public areas were quietly busy throughout the day and evening with people obviously there knowing the Milestone reputation. At the end of our dinner in the restaurant one evening, Prince Harry and Meghan came in for dinner in the private dining room. No surprise- Kennsington Palace, his childhood home across the street, was lovingly decorated by the people for the 20th anniversary of Diana's death- a very moving sight.    The story of the Milestone Hotel was posted in our room and gave us an appreciation for the preservation efforts of the Brits through so many decades. It also explains the‚Ä¶"
October 2017,Excellent service but sense of narrowness haunted us,"I want to agree with all the reviews praising the staff hospitality and professionalism. All our requests met immediate response, we felt care during all our stay. The location is ideal when you are to explore neighborhoods - Kensington, Chelsea, Knightsbridge and probably Mayfair. What really surprised - pretty compressed spaces in lobby, dining hall, other public areas. Tiny superior rooms where queen bed occupies two-thirds (or even more) of room space. Imagine if you are two in this room. Yes, the hotel occupies a historic English country manor style building and such features might be expected. Just be aware of that when making your choice."
October 2017,A layover to remember ,"My husband and I stayed at The Milestone on a layover this week.  I honestly can't say enough good things about the hotel.   From the moment you arrive,  every staff member goes out of their way to treat you like royalty.   When arrived in our room,  we were greeted with champagne,  a thank you card,  cookies and a little souvenir.   Later that night we went to dinner to celebrate my husband's birthday and when we got back to our room,  they had placed a pair of slippers on each side of the bed,  lit a candle in the bathroom by the tub and left us a little treat on the nightstand.   To say they go above and beyond is an understatement!  "
September 2017,Service is amazing,"I loved the Milestone Hotel!  The service, location, room size and amenities were all perfect.  I felt the staff went above and beyond and always addressed me by name, even the second I arrived and stepped out of the taxi, how do they do that??  This is definitely the hotel to choose when you're in London.  The location is perfect too, it's right across the street from Kensington Palace and within walking distance of restaurants and shops."
September 2017,Amazing first experience in London,"We stayed 4 nights and it was simply top notch! We had breakfast included, we had one dinner, afternoon tea and a few occasions to sit in the bar at the hotel and everything from quality of food to service was incredible.  We celebrated our anniversary while there and they went more than the extra mile to make it one of the most memorable. All of the staff were helpful, courteous, and definitely know what customer service means.  Our room was extremely beautiful and comfortable.  Loved the bathroom as well. Loved our entire stay!!"
November 2016,The MOST Amazing boutique hotel. Service superb!,We stayed 2 nights and had breakfast included in our rate - highly recommend.  WE ate at the hotel Restauarant the second night - and food and service (again) were excellent. We were greeted by name from the first minute we arrived until we checked out.  We travel internationally 2X a year and this is one of our favorites ever.  The Bar is intimate and charming and the Bartender/restaurant manager - Fabrizio - whipped up a hot toddy for my husband as he was feeing a bit under the weather.
July 2017,I almost don't want to tell you how wonderful this place is.....,"This is an oasis of serenity, and smoothly run in the centre of a bustling city. Thoughtfully chosen wines to go with beautifully thought out menus. A real treat to come here. The atmosphere and the building itself will appeal to overseas visitors, and UK visitors  alike. I look forward to returning."
July 2017,"Best Hotel, Best Staff","We recently stayed at the Milestone on our first trip to London.  Having done plenty of research, this quaint, boutique hotel was my choice.  It did not disappoint! Steven, one of the doormen, greeted us and made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived.  We had two rooms, and each was perfectly appointed.  The Stables Bar was a favorite stop, and Afternoon Tea, and the pictures your staff took, gave us memories for a lifetime.  Lastly, the location is absolutely perfect.  The Milestone is directly across from Kensington Palace, giving us the luxury of evening walks in the Gardens and quick access to the Diana Exhibit and Royal Albert Hall.  We loved it so much that we are already talking about a return trip.  This is an exceptional and unique hotel that is full of character!"
July 2017,Impressive Jewel in the best location with exceptional service that feels like home... I gave them a 10 or A+,"This hotel is one of the BEST in the world, just the feeling to walk around is unique. Beautiful property, outstanding service from entire staff, great location, excellent food!. They did such a wonderful job that we felt at home!.  I visited with my family and it is impressive how they took care of every single detail. The hotel is charming with lots of history and upgraded to the highest standards. I travel a lot and have a lot of opportunities to see and visit properties, but this one is totally unique! Charming and it offers an excellent experience to all kind of guests.  Business, leisure, single, families, all..The staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and we had a wonderful stay!..."
July 2017,Excellent Hotel,"We were greeted by our names at the curb when our taxi dropped us off and through our entire six day stay. This was remarkable attention regardless if you are having breakfast , dinner or a refreshment in the lounge. Undoubtedly the best staff we have encountered. The service, meals and amenities are the best. I highly recommend this hotel. The location is excellent, across the street from Kensington Gardens, a beautiful park, close to the tube, and there are good restaurants nearby walking distance. The concierge did an excellent job of dinner reservations and arranging daily activities. This was our first vacation in London and this hotel made the vacation GREAT. We will stay here again."
July 2017,Best hotel I've ever stayed at!,"From the food to the service to the location, this hotel can't be beat. Everyone knew our name, even if we hadn't met them yet!  They learn your likes and cater to them.  Also great fitness area. Friendly and fun."
July 2017,Charming small hotel with exceptionally friendly and competent staff.,"I would have given a higher rating had we not encountered a plumbing issue upon checking into our room.  However, the hotel staff was quick to address the problem and moved us to another room for our first night so that the problem could be remedied (a part needed to be purchased and installed).  The hotel management was extremely apologetic and sent a bottle of champagne to our temporary room that first evening.  We were moved back into our original room, which we liked very much, the next day.   When my wife and I appeared for dinner in the hotel restaurant (very cozy and romantic) that evening, we were told that the dinner was on them.  Very considerate and thoughtful.  The hotel is located at the southwest corner of Hyde Park in a very posh part of town.  With Kensington‚Ä¶"
July 2017,'Mini Moon' Location,"We stayed for a couple of days following our wedding at this Hotel is exceptional. We were made to feel at home as soon as we arrived and checked in. The staff are very professional and can't do enough for you. We'd booked afternoon tea on the afternoon of our arrival and it was superb. I have a wheat intolerance and it was catered for, without fuss and my food looked exactly the same as the wheat option so I wasn't made to feel different. The bar areas are a lovely place to relax and the our room was beautiful. We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back."
July 2017,Exceptional - I highly recommend it and I will return.,I stayed in a deluxe  King room with a view of Hyde Park.  It was a great location - lots of green open space and a nice area of London near Harrod's.  I loved the decor - fully renovated but if you like modern decor this is not for you.  Cleanliness 10/10 and does not smell musty- quite an achievement in a building so old.  Accolades to the Housekeeping department.  Service exceptional and memorable.  Staff were polite and warm without being intrusive - they make it look easy but I am sure it isn't and I appreciate the effort involved.  I  felt warmly welcomed throughout my stay.  Almost every staff member remembered to address me using my name.  Every request I made was promptly attended.  Thank you!   The service was much better than at the Rosewood and the Baglioni. This is‚Ä¶
June 2017,Honeymoon,"We stayed at the Milestone for the first two nights of our honeymoon in the U.K. The staff was nice, friendly, and thoughtful. When they learned it was our honeymoon, they dressed our room while we were out to dinner and we came home to rose petals, candles, chocolate, and smooth music on. It was so sweet and thoughtful and we were touched that they went above and beyond to make our honeymoon that much more lovely. We fell in love with London and the Milestone during our trip."
July 2017,Afternoon Tea was our kids highlight of a month in London,Took our 4 kids to London for a month in the summer of 2017... we did EVERYTHING and you know what they remember most? Afternoon Tea at the Milestone Hotel.  If you have young kids (ours are ages 4-10) this is a MUST DO on your next trip to London. The staff was outstanding and treated our kids like royalty (I promise you they are not). We will definitely return next time we're in town.
June 2017,Special hotel,"Just returned from 2 nights at this hotel.  It is an exceptional hotel with wonderful service.  Many small details are included that truly make you feel special:  you are greeted by name each time you enter and leave the hotel, sit in the bar, call reception and room service, etc.  Each day small treats appeared in our room-cookies, fruit, etc.  You are made to feel pampered and the staff can not do enough to make you feel welcomed.  They are attentive without being overbearing. The rooms are clean and beds are comfortable.  Housekeeping is quick to respond to any needs (i.e.. an iron, extra pillows, etc) And of course Kensington is a wonderful area to be in when visiting London-easy transport to everything you need and want to see when visiting.  Also, just strolling through‚Ä¶"
July 2017,AN EXCELLENT HOTEL TO STAY FOR VACATION OR ANNIVERSARY,"Our family's stay in The Milestone Hotel in London went beyond our dreams. This was an extraordinary experience for our 40th anniversary! The staff were delightful and catered to all our needs and comfort. The location was in walking distance of our family members and some of them joined us for breakfast. The food, amenities and valet parking was excellent. We will be telling our travel agent of AAA Utah to Highly recommend this unique hotel. We have already informed all our family and friends. Can't wait to visit London and stay there again in the near future."
July 2017,Fabulous afternoon tea,"Myself and two friends visited The Milestone on Saturday 1st July for afternoon tea. We were greeted with such a warm welcome - nothing was too much trouble, the service was faultless and the hotel was beautiful.  There is an endless tea menu and the varying platters of sandwiches, cakes and scones were absolutely delicious! We even had to take some home with us in a box as we weren't quite able to finish it all!  The staff can't do enough for you and there was no feeling of being rushed even though the hotel was busy.  A really lovely afternoon, thank you.  "
May 2017,Miles above the rest!,"My wife and I had to come up with plans for a different kind of London trip as the Adele concert we wanted to attend was suddenly canceled and we had booked our flights way in advance with no cancellation option. Staying at the Wembley Hilton across the venue didn‚Äôt make sense anymore so we had to pick a new hotel in central London. Great reviews led us to The Milestone Hotel. A beautiful building in a great location right next to Kensington Gardens. When we arrived a bit before checkin time and the room wasn‚Äôt ready we got complementary glasses of champagne and chatted with the especially friendly and attentive staff for a while, then were treated to a short tour highlighting the great history of this place. We had booked a deluxe studio room that - like the rest of the‚Ä¶"
June 2017,"Great staff, ok room, poor location","The staff was wonderful. The bartenders, concierge, front office, and servers were all great.  Above all were the bellmen who spent many minutes flagging down cabs, a problem caused by horrible traffic.   Dinner was excellent.  The breakfast was pretty good, although buffet could have been better.  The room was nice, we looked out on the park.  A serious problem was a steep step to the bathroom.  I have bad legs and it was a problem  Location was bad. On the SW corner of Kensington Park there is nothing near by, except K Palace itself. The tube is 0.4 miles away, so a cab is needed. The traffic is very bad, and the bellmen spent many minutes flagging one down  We would happily return if we got a better room and somehow traffic was better"
July 2017,Most Extraordinary Staff we have EVER EXPERIENCED,"The Milestone is a truly charming, lovely, boutique hotel situated directly across from Kensington Palace. The physical charms of the place could be enough, but the staff and the extra touches are beyond amazing. We were there for only 4 days/nights but felt like we belonged, with everyone greeting us by name, serving us beyond what was expected, and bringing surprises every night including a strawberry birthday cake. The turndown services and high tea, the in room accoutrements, everything was perfect. Plus the dover sole in the restaurant was some of the best I have ever eaten.  Kudos to everyone at the Milestone for contributing to such a wonderful London visit."
May 2017,Don't stay anywhere else,Incredible hotel. True 5 star service. The hotel is in a beautiful area just across from Kensington palace. The food is excellent. We were still on USA time and loved that we were able to have food served in the lounge at midnight. Also have the best mixed drinks in london.Can't say enough about this place. Definitely will be back.
June 2017,Amazing Experience,"Wow wow wow. What can I even say about the Milestone Hotel. This was by far the best hotel experience we have ever had. Upon check-in, they gave us a tour of the hotel for about 20 mins, telling us about all of the history which was very cool in itself. Our room was smaller but very nice and it has premium everything. The elevators, stairs, every common area, super nice. They also give all guest any free drink upon check-in which is also cool. This hotel is also right off of the Underground which is easy too.  The dedicated 24 hour concierge here is amazing too, there are a few staff that do this job and all are excellent at recommending things. They can also book things for you at a discount and avoid the lines which is also amazing. They booked us tickets to a show and tickets‚Ä¶"
May 2017,Amazing Small Hotel in London,"The Milestone is probably one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in and we have stayed in a lot of great hotels.  This is a beautifully restored old hotel overlooking Hyde Park with exquisite details in room decor, linens, toiletries and other amenities.  Food is top notch and the bar is classic London pub with a great bartender.  To match the great facility is the amazing staff and incredible customer service.  We arrived by taxi from our flight from Nice France and the doorman greeted us by name, whisked us into the hotel and said I am so sorry but there is someone checking in at the moment so let's go to the bar and I will buy you a drink.  He told the bartender to get us anything we wanted while we waited.  We were served by a great bartender and three times while we‚Ä¶"
May 2017,Perfection,"Just a few days ago, my mother and I returned to the US after a wonderful 3-week trip in Europe.  The Milestone Hotel was a definite highlight of our entire trip.  The property is simply beautiful.  It provided us with the ""old world"" decor and experience we'd hoped for.  During our five-night stay, we had the opportunity to stay in two lovely rooms, each with unique and sumptuous decor.  We felt so pampered by the little touches, including the welcome drink, luxurious soaps, complimentary water, cute slippers, surprise champagne, candles in the bath tub, treats on our pillows, special gifts brought to our room, etc, etc.  The rooms were spotless (the remote control was even sanitized!), the beds very comfortable, and the d√©cor was gorgeous and inviting.  The antique‚Ä¶"
August 2017,Great hotel with incredible service,"The Hotel itself is decorated impeccably for the location and the time period of the hotel. The fresh flowers that are placed in your room daily to the slippers being set up at the side of your bed at turndown service make the quality of the housekeeping above par. They not only turned down the bed and set out the slippers, they left candies as well as turned on the television to a romantic music channel and had candles lit throughout the room. When you wake up you can go down to the restaurant and have a full English breakfast that was probably the best meal we had while we were in London. I know that is not saying much since London is not known for their cuisine, but everything we had was excellent. Fresh orange, grapefruit or pineapple juice accompanied the perfectly cooked‚Ä¶"
July 2017,Lovely spa day,"Came here for a massage and to use facilities for a few hours. Whilst the spa is very small (small swimming pool, sauna, small relaxing area enough for two ppl then gym, changing rooms and massage room) it was perfect for what we wanted and we were the only ones there. The pool had a jet so that you can swim in one place against the current.  Massage was really lovely and the therapist, Moy (sp?) was so welcoming - we both felt so relaxed after. Would definitely go again if in the area "
July 2017,Wonderful stay,It was our first time in London I am very happy to stay in hotel milestone hospitality is too good laundry service is available in the hotel free WiFi Internet access spa is available in the hotel swimming pool is also ervry thing was great fantabulus thank you for feel me like homely 
August 2017,Stellar Experience ,"My husband and I celebrated my 30th birthday and our 8 year wedding anniversary. We went to London, Paris and Rome. We can truly share with you all that no one made us feel more at home than the wonderful team at The Milestone Hotel!! Our experience was stellar, the staff members truly go beyond the call of duty to make you feel at home. From the minute our driver pulled up to the hotel we were given the royal treatment! We truly can't wait to go back and stay again at The Milestone Hotel! We will see you soon Patricio, Ronald, Fran!! To name a few ‚ù§Ô∏è"
October 2016,Amazing,"Wow, what a phenomenal place.  A really great property with spectacular staff.  I was made to feel extremely special at every single moment.  Kind of awe inspiring how detailed and genuine their interest was in being invested in me as there guest.  Location is excellent.  Common spaces comfortable, cozy and upscale.  I want to give a special mention to Clea who kept me engaged in conversation while awaiting my cab ride to the airport.  Frank and Jose at concierge for especially arranging everything regarding my tickets to a soccer/football game.  Pranav for a fantastic check-in.  Angelo in the lounge was amazingly friendly.  All these amazingly polished staff were spot on with each guest, not just me.  Room was spotless.  Fruits on special treats at check in and throughout my‚Ä¶"
June 2017,The Best,"stayed in Mistinguett suite Wife organised as a surprise for my birthday. The room was fantastic  Champagne was in room as well as cake.We had drinks in race theme bar,great place for drinks.Went to China town for meal and back to Milestone. The staff were fantastic  through  out stay.Next day had cream tea in the most fantastic room .When you step outside the Milestone it make you feel like a million dollars to know you have stayed in one of the world's best hotels.Exspenive but I am sure my wife would say worth every penny. Thanks to ALL the staff."
April 2017,Top Notch Historic Hotel in London!,"Fabulous stay with FABULOUS service. Ask for the wakeup service.  They come knock on your door with a wonderful tray of fresh coffee to help wake you up.  Incredible staff.  We had afternoon tea which was also a wonderful London experience.  The bar area on the patio is a must see. Also, the cocktail under smoked glass is a must order."
June 2017,City break,"Clean and comfortable rooms a bit dated but did the job. Fair  walk from shops specially when the weather isn't that great and you have a pram to push all the way. Staff have been great, very polite and helpful. Couldn't comment about the food as we didmt use that facility, although other friends that were staying here with us did and said it was good quality and tasty. Would recommend"
July 2017,The Place to Stay in London,"I should start by telling you that this is my husband's favorite hotel ever. And for me, it ranks right there with Le Sireneuse (pre-husband).   The hotel sits right on the edge of Hyde Park, in front of Kensington Gardens (which are in front of Kensignton Palace, a five minute walk from the hotel). It is in the grandest neighborhood in London. In fact, London't most posh residential street is mere blocks away. But that's less important for a tourist. The important things for us were the fact that we could walk to the fabulous museum district, there was a nearby metro stop, and there are lots of restaurants nearby. London is a huge city--it felt to us, probably because we were not familiar with it--bigger than New York, so having a convenient hotel in the heart of this lovely‚Ä¶"
July 2017,The Magnificent Milestone!,"The signature trait of The Milestone is exemplary service and a gracious staff.  The amenities can be found at other hotels, but you cannot find the qualified wonderful staff that embodies The Milestone. The hotel is located across from Hyde Park and Kensington Palace. It is a short walk to the Royal Albert Hall.  Andrei, one of the concierge staff, through his connections was able to get us great seats to the first night of PROMS on the day of the performance.   You may get beautiful accommodations elsewhere, but the service is matched by none."
June 2017,Highlight of trip was our stay at Milestone,"Did not think it could get better than previous visit last fall but it did! Spent a week and entire staff was like family - world class starting with Jose and his concierge team to creative bar staff to front desk to doorman Steven.  Wonderful servers in restaurant be it for breakfast, high tea or dinner.  Have stayed in big and small hotels around the world from NY to Paris to Bangkok. This is as good as it gets. "
June 2017,Wonderful,"My wife, two young daughters and our miniature dachshund have just stayed here for three nights and we couldn't recommend it more.  We were made to feel at home by every single member of staff - all so welcoming, friendly, helpful and professional.  The hotel is beautifully maintained, with attention to detail everywhere, from the decor in the rooms, to the food, to the staff - nothing is too much trouble.  There were so many small touches which we were surprised with that our little girls will remember their stay here forever (paricular thanks to Peggy!). It is wonderfully situated by Kensington Gardens and is also a perfect five star hotel for pets. I am really struggling to think of any negatives, for once.  It is not cheap, but then this is a true five star hotel right in‚Ä¶"
June 2017,5 star accommodation with 100 star hospitality!,"I stayed for two nights as a guest with some friends who stayed longer. What can I say? A fantastic hotel which seemed to cater to any need, want or whim. From Giacomo and Angelo in the bar to Stephen on the door, everyone on the staff was friendly and approachable and all gave us excellent recommendations for activities and eateries. Lilli served us afternoon tea on my arrival and her attentiveness and friendliness was unsurpassed. What a little gem.  Although I didn't use it (this time) the hotel has a fantastic dog friendly policy. As a dog owner myself this is a real bonus in the city. I should add we didn't see or hear another dog all weekend which to me means this hotel offers a discrete service. If you don't like dogs you needn't worry."
June 2017,Spectacular in every way!,"The Milestone is incomparable! The attention to every detail is exquisite, from Jose who arranged transfers and tickets for day trips and fabulous dinner reservations, to Steven who is delightful to talk with each and every time you go out the door, to the fabulous spa. Afternoon Tea is fantastic, as is the morning breakfast. This is a true gem in London! We would definitely stay again, in fact will look forward to doing so!  It is worth it in every aspect!! The area in Kensington is perfect, just across from Kensington Palace and Gardens. Perfect location for walking, dining, strolling the park, and shopping. I can easily see why it wins best hotel in London! It absolutely should!!!"
June 2017,The location is perfect. You can walk across the street to Kensington Gardens.,The staff was superb. Every interaction left us with a smile. Our room was upgraded to a beautiful suite with fresh fruit on our arrival. The location is within walking distance to Kensington Palace and Victoria and Albert Museum.
May 2017,Dreams Do Come True,"This establishment is superior the quality customercare is amazing! I was so looking forward to returning to this hotel and it certainly did not disappoint! It truly is a special haven in busy London. If I could give more stars I would! Thank you once again to the management and staff at this hotel for making us feel welcome guests. It's nice to see that Pedro is still welcoming guests and I have to thank another staff member also I think Kharli- he bought us our room service. But each staff member I have encountered are gracious and the meals served in the dining room are delicious. Till we make another journey to London we will be back to make more memories, until then I shall have to savour the memories of our recent stay. The view over Kensington gardens is beautiful and‚Ä¶"
June 2017,Lovely oasis in Kensington,"We received a lovely welcome as the doorman valet-parked our car for us. Check in was smooth and quick and the delightful staff in this hotel all seemed to know our name straight away. We were given a tour of the hotel and then escorted to our room where a welcome glass of champagne was offered. The room was lovely with plenty of magazines, complimentary bottled water as well as all the usual amenities. A complimentary newspaper and other gifts arrived during our one-night stay. We had lunch in their restaurant ( Chenestons-see my seperate review) before visiting the nearby Science Museum in the afternoon. Other museums are also nearby as is the Royal Albert Hall where we went to a concert in the evening. Kensington gardens and palace are just over the road from the hotel. The‚Ä¶"
May 2017,"AN OTHER WORDLY  OASIS,THIS IS   BEST HOTEL SERVICE IN THE WORLD","I have been staying  and visiting this hotel for 25 years  and it is only when you stay at this place do you realise how rude and cold staff  are anywhere and everywhere else..The warmth and sweetness and attentiveness of the staff cannot be overstated whoever picks these characters is the best personal manager on the planet ,because the staff has changed over the years ,but the type of personality hired  has remained  .The food is by far the absolute finest quality and value for money in England, you simply cannot find better ,The personal touches and beautiful presentation and service is enough to make you weep with appreciation .It is NEVER  snooty ,pretentious or oppressively trendy .It's a wonderful old fashioned hotel with an intimate atmosphere that is the very definition‚Ä¶"
May 2017,Sublime eloquent hotel,"As usual we researched TripAdvisor and selected The Milestone Hotel and our expectations were far exceeded. In every way, room, food, decor, location and service the hotel was so comforting that it became our friendly relaxing home. We shall return."
May 2017,Exceptional,I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights. This is definitely an exceptional hotel. The staff is amazing no other words to describe their hospitality.  Outstanding room. Indulging bathroom and amenities. Location is beautiful nearby Kensington Palace and Kensington Park.  Definitely I'll come again
June 2017,Recent stay at The Milestone ,"Our stay at The Milestone Hotel was amazing.  You simply won't find a more dedicated, helpful staff anywhere.  I highly recommend this hotel. We will definitely return next time we stop in London and will look for other Red Carnation hotels in the future"
June 2017,Paradise found,"The traffic from the airport was horrible and the day was very warm and humid.  London cabs are not air conditioned, so by the time we pulled up in front of the hotel, we were not in the best of moods, however the moment we stepped out of the cab, were greeted by an immaculately dressed doorman escorted up the stairs and into the lobby our moods were changed from flat to almost giddy.  We felt transported into the ideal England, cool and crisp with every visual clue saying that everything was going to be just fine.  The staff was friendly without too much sugar added.  We were given a short tour of the ground floor; sitting room, dining spaces and hallways filled with non-pretentious art and then shown up to our room (303), a very pretty two level affair with the bathroom tucked‚Ä¶"
May 2017,The Milestone London,"This hotel was perfect for our vacation.  Great location, wonderful rooms, and best of all the staff.  From check in to departure the staff handled our every need.  I will stay there again the next time I am in London."
June 2017,The Stables Bar,"Recommended by a friend as a great place for really good cocktails, we were not at all disappointed! A quiet bar tucked back into a gorgeous hotel with a fun ambience and amazing service and bites. The Old Fashioned came out in a clear dome with smoke giving the cocktail a very unique twist on a old classic. The champagne cocktails were fantastic. Looking forward to coming back again someday soon!"
May 2017,Treated like royalty ,"I brought my 13 yr old daughter to London for the first time. We spent 8 luxurious days at the Milestone. It is a beautiful hotel in lovely Kensington. The staff is what makes this place so special. They are knowledgeable, helpful and thought of our every need and surprised us with many treats before we could request them. We cannot say enough about this crew. Tim and Andreas (concierge team) took such great care of us, as well as the bar team, wait staff, doormen and housekeeping. It is obvious that they all love their work and their clients. Thank you for an amazing home away from home! xo Sandy and Grace"
May 2017,Best Hotel I've ever stayed at.  ,"Had an amazing stay here in May. The staff were top notch in their dedication to service.  The bar was small but very comfortable.  Order an old fashioned, it's bare far the best presentation I've ever seen.  "
June 2017,Five Star Perfection!,"One cannot do better than to spend your stay in London at The Milestone Hotel.  The Milestone is a true five star hotel with a staff who are willing to always go above and beyond any expectation to make you feel like a treasured house guest. The Milestone's philosophy is simple and effective - they are the best because they absolutely put the customer first!.  During this trip, we we negatively impacted by the British Airways global IT outage.  The staff at the Milestone did everything in their power to ensure that we were able to rearrange our schedule so that we would not miss any of our planned activities despite losing some vacation time due to the BA debacle.  We would not think of staying anywhere else in London because the Milestone has continuously earned our loyalty and‚Ä¶"
June 2017,Why would you stay anywhere else?,"The Milestone Hotel is my go to place in London.  It's an easy drive to and from Heathrow.  But, the hotel after 6-7 stays the last 3 years has never disappointed and always delighted.  The staff is excellent.  They make you feel so at home.  They are top notch and always want to serve.  It's my experience that at 5-star hotels that I often feel as if a hand is out all the time for a tip -- and here when you tip I felt so appreciated and never expected.  The rooms are excellent old english style with amazing amenities.  The food is just outstanding.  Simple.  Clean. Fresh.  Amazing.  The bar area is wonderful with the black and white garden room.  I stayed for the first time on a vacation with my family and the hotel did everything possible to make it an absolute delight.  From‚Ä¶"
June 2017,Amazing ,Booked The Milestone as a birthday treat and was not disappointed! The room was beautiful and the way we were treated was fantastic. Special mention to Peggy who was really lovely...we will definitely be back!
May 2017,British Excellence,"One of the most gorgeous and unique boutique hotels in the world. Each of the rooms are different and very unique. The bar is wonderful. Tea service is lovely (they even have a special tea for younger guests). You don't have to be staying at the hotel to come for tea or stop in for drinks, so I'd recommend stopping by even if you don't stay here. "
May 2017,Impeccable Service,"This very British establishment features first rate hospitality and  a lovely ambience. The lobby and rooms are a bit small and the restaurant overpriced, but the staff, decor and location are superb and we would not hesitate to recommend this hotel."
April 2017,"Best Hotel Experience in London in a long, long time","We just finished a week long stay at the Milestone Hotel in Kensington.  We had originally booked another hotel and there were complications with our room.  They referred us to the Milestone.  From the moment we arrived we were treated as special guests.  They found us a large, well appointed room overlooking Kensington Park. The public rooms were a very comfortable venue.  The entire staff is exceptional and went the extra mile to see that nothing was missing for our comfort during our stay.No task was too small, no want of ours went unanswered.  I would stay there again without hesitation and definitely recommend it highly.  The Kourts Los Angeles, CA."
May 2017,Outstanding Hotel,I stayed in this hotel for one night upon my arrival in London.  The staff is amazing and the hotel will spoil you.  My room was tiny but the bathroom was fantastic.  Tea is wonderful.  This is definitely a 5 star hotel.
May 2017,Outstanding hotel,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this beautiful hotel. Located across from the park and close to everything, this hotel showcases the best of England. Beautiful surroundings, very thoughtfully appointed and with incredibly helpful staff. We can't wait to come back and visit. "
April 2017,Prepare to be spoiled rotten!,"Have you ever been spoiled, I mean really spoiled, beyond your wildest dreams? I have, because my husband and I stayed for a night at The Milestone Hotel.  nothing during our stay was too much trouble, the staff were all extreamly pleasant and very helpful.  It felt as though if you so much as sneezed there would be someone handing you a tissue! It felt slightly strange to be given so much special attention as my husband and I are just ordinary family people, but for for one night it felt like a glimpse into how the 'other half' live.  There was lots of added extras, complimentary drink on arrival, lots of quality toiletries and ¬£50 allowance for food in the hotel. These so much thought been put into making your stay as comfortable as possible that we were left wanting for‚Ä¶"
May 2017,Passing through on the way to Barcelona ,"Prepared to be spoiled! From the staff, to the rooms and the amenities the quality of our stay was 5 star all the way. The moment we walked in the door we were treated like special guests with a tour of the hotel and little treats in our room. The staff is so enjoyable and always ready to assist, it would be easy to never leave the hotel. We only had 3 nights at the Milestone, but would not hesitate to stay there again. Wish we had been able to enjoy the afternoon tea. It looked amazing! Next time. Don't miss the bar or the restaurant either!"
May 2017,Why Stay Anywhere Else?,"""No request too large, no detail too small"" is the service philosophy of Milestone, and do they ever deliver!  From the minute that you walk in the door, you are treated as if you are the most important person at the hotel. Every single staff member is customer service oriented and very, very friendly. Our room exceeded our expectations!  The attention to detail in the room from complimentary water to evening turndown is amazing. If you have a request, it is taken care of immediately, and sometimes even if you don't ask. Yes, they are that good!  The beds are wonderfully comfortable and you can choose the perfect pillow for a great night's sleep. Milestone is located in less congested Kensington across from the palace. Tube, taxi or bus are all close by for easy access to any‚Ä¶"
February 2017,25th Anniversary at the Milestone Hotel,"We celebrated our 25th Anniversary at the Milestone Hotel.  Our four days there were perfection.  The staff went all out to make our celebration special.  It is a small hotel so once you check in they know your name and are very good at anticipating your needs.  We ate in their wonderful restaurant the first evening and when we returned to the room they had decorated it with 25th anniversary candles, chocolates, etc.  A very unexpected and nice touch.    Throughout the stay the staff was helpful with tickets, restaurant reservations, getting cabs, directions, laundry and everything that makes being on the road easier.  The room was beautiful with a small balcony and the location just across the street from Kensington Palace was perfect.  Highly recommended!"
February 2017,Safe luxurious pampered stay,"This is the second time we have had Mother Daughter visit to London and been so comfortable staying here with my pre-teen and teenage daughters. We feel like we are staying in a lovely home. And all of the staff goes out of their way to make us happy. From the super yummy breakfast served in the lovely restaurant eatting with silver spoons, to the advice to get around to our slighly odd requests for things daughters have seen on youtubers channels... to white table cloth but feels like a special home dinner (we loved the chicken pot pie and tried the reciepe at home after) and best afternoon tea is at the Milestone. Oh - and a live pianist one evening. Fresh flowers everywhere.Our room was a vision.  Walk out the door and are in Kensington Gardens / Palace entrance wonderful‚Ä¶"
May 2017,Delightful!,"What a treat! Such a friendly and helpful team who make you feel completely at home. Excellent cocktail bar with an extensive list of cocktails. The rooms are amazing, we were upgraded on the day which was a real treat as it was our wedding anniversary! We will 100% be returning!"
January 2017,Superb service and true luxury,"I took my son to stay at the Milestone hotel as we had tickets to an event at the Royal Albert Hall that night. The staff were wonderfully attentive and made our stay so special. Nothing was too much trouble and we felt so pampered. The food was amazing, breakfast and dinner just superb and the decor was so sumptuous and yet relaxed. We had a quick dip in the plunge pool before breakfast, which was a bonus. Cannot recommend it highly enough. "
January 2017,Like returning home,"Another return to the Milestone, this time with our family, et al, of 12.  From the moment we arrived we were warmly welcomed, and even though it was late well looked after.  From the bespoke cocktail mixing exhibition in the bar, to High Tea, to Steve the doorman making my grandson his assistant, with top hat and all, the concierge staff, beautiful rooms  . . . our stay was brilliant."
January 2017,The perfect birthday celebration hotel,"Stayed 2 nights and held an afternoon tea party in their intimate function room. Service was impeccable and made to feel very welcome. Atmosphere is relaxed and friendly. I chose the hotel as it was dog friendly. My dog was allowed in the room, and in an annex for breakfast and the conservatory for a relaxed drink. A real rarity to be able to stay in luxury along with my dog. Food was a good standard for the afternoon tea. I would recommend this hotel and I will definitely stay there again. Perfect location just across from Kensington Palace for a visit or just a walk around their gardens with the dog."
November 2016,Best Hotel in the UK - My Favorite in the world. Easily the best service and staff in the world.,"This is an incredibly classy, unique and very cool hotel - and is the UK's hidden gem.  It is literally like stumbling on Britain's best kept secret. Even many Londoners don't know it.  Traditional and beautiful the rooms are luxurious and super comfortable. The bar and conservatory are private, intimate and cool. The Lounge and restaurant are relaxed and food great. The views over Hyde Park are unparalleled - but even the rooms without the view are so great and all rooms are a welcome retreat from busy days in London.  The service here in my opinion is unmatched - anywhere - I have ever been in the world. And thats coming from the west coast of the US where we are spoilt with service with a smile. I can't praise the staff here enough - they are so welcoming, helpful and nothing‚Ä¶"
January 2017,I wished I lived here!,"An exceptional hotel in London. Rooms are so clean, comfortable and quiet and the attention to detail is awesome! Great stay always satisfied! Thank you guys you always treat me and my family like royalty!"
February 2016,Superb stay!,"We stayed last night for my wife's birthday and had a fantastic time. We were upgraded to a stunning suite with multiple rooms, two fireplaces and a cozy to nook with bookshelves. The service is amazing - possibly the best I've experienced. Keep up the great work!"
January 2017,Beautiful,"I stayed here a couple of times in the past and had a lovely stay. Staff were pleasant and helpful, food was delicious and rooms were cosy and comfortable. Highly recommended. A great location for seeing the city."
January 2017,A great stay,"This is my second time at the Milestone Hotel, and the experience has been, if possible even better than the first time, everyone makes you feel home, with spacial attention. Is the Hotel i can suggest to everyone looking for something special!"
January 2017,Wow. Just wow.,"We got an upgrade to a junior suite, overlooking Kensington Gardens an Palace. Staff were extremely friendly, funny and helpful. We felt like friends, not guests. Breakfast was great, too. We will be back,"
January 2017,Just fantastic,Brilliant location and interior and the most attentive helpful staff we've ever encountered. There aren't many places we'd go back to but this is certainly top of that list. We were spoiled rotten from beginning to end.
January 2017,Amazing stay,We spent a night at The Milestone during January.  We chose this hotel as it was close to the Royal Albert Hall and also as a special treat for my wifes birthday (one of the those with a 0 on the end!)  We had a fantastic stay.  Upon arrival all staff were very polite and helpful.  We had arrived a little early and were offered complimentary snacks and drink while our room was prepared.  We were also advised that we had been upgraded to a studio room.   Upon arrival at our room my wife had been left a birthday chocolate cake and some biscuits along with a personalised note wishing her a Happy Birthday. We had a great afternoon at the Royal Albert Hall and returned to the hotel several hour later.  Again we were greeted by name at the door and asked if we had enjoyed the RAH and‚Ä¶
January 2017,Wonderful!,"We spent 2 nights at the Milestone and it was a wonderful experience. From the minute we arrived we knew that we had made a great choice. The staff were amazing, the hotel rooms spotless and super comfy and the breakfast fare delicious. I have stayed at a lot of places over the years and this one tops the list. We will definitely be back. Thank you Milestone for a wonderful visit."
January 2017,Exceptional,"Second time at the Milestone - an exceptional hotel in London. Looked after like family from start to finish - nothing is too much trouble for any of the team. Rooms are immaculate, comfortable and quiet and the attention to detail sets a standard few might surpass. Andrew Pike should be very proud.  Thank you again. "
January 2017,Another excellent Red Carnation Hotel,"First time at The Milestone having visited other excellent Red Carnation Hotels and it was a wonderful experience, with personal touches to make the stay extra enjoyable. Super food and helpful, friendly staff. Would definitely go back along with other Red Carnation Hotels."
November 2016,Be spoilt like a treasured friend (and dog),"In the previous year my wife and I have had the good fortune to have stayed at the Savoy, Dorchester and Milestone. When it came to choosing a place to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary we opted rot eh Milestone.   The Savoy was impressive to look at but we weren't made to feel special in any way. The Dorchester treated us like honoured guests, the Milestone treated us like treasured friends, and that includes our large dog. Hence we opted to return to the Milestone for our 2nd anniversary  The moment we walked in we were treated with great warmth from all the staff, from the doorman, the concierge, and receptionists, to room service and in the restaurant. Nothing was too much trouble and when they found out we were celebrating our anniversary we got cards and momentos from‚Ä¶"
January 2017,Worth visiting ,"The hotel has all the facilities, which are expected while staying in a hotel.  The people are all welcoming and smiling.  The cafe staff is nice and reception is warm and energetic.  A good stay to remember. "
January 2017,The Best Hotel in London?,"It's so easy when visiting London to fall into the trap of booking the nearest ""chain"" hotel to ones desired location.  I'm so glad that I broke this habit by listening to Tripadvisor and then booking a room at the Milestone.  This charming expression of old-world values is a true gem of a hotel amongst the throng of ""room boxes"" to be found across the city.  Every room at the Milestone is uniquely furnished and appointed and the public areas are beautifully decorated and adorned with traditional furnishings and works of art.  However, the most impressive aspect of this hotel is the superb team of staff who appear to take genuine pleasure in ensuring that every guest is treated like royalty.  I will never again book a 4/5 star chain hotel in London while The Milestone continues‚Ä¶"
November 2016,Service and Location are Top Notch,"My friend and I stayed at the Milestone for the first week of January while we visited London. We had a great stay. When we arrived, we were greeted and told that we had been updated to a studio and that our room would be available in a few hours (we arrived in the early morning). We went to the dining room and had a wonderful breakfast while we waited.   Our room was lovely. Very spacious, comfortable, and quiet. There are many services included in the room fee, but we didn't take advantage of most of them. When we did need anything, the staff was friendly and fast to respond. A friend sent a bottle of champagne to our room, and we received a very nice personal note from the manager along with the bottle on ice. There were treats left for us each evening at turn down, and a few‚Ä¶"
December 2016,Best Luxurious hotel with excellent service,"My wife and I stayed at this best luxurious hotel which was classic British style. From the moment we go, we found greeted with warm and best friendly staff. Our best room was beautiful with all the amenities including comfy bathrobesssssss and slipperssssssss. The staff was extremely helpful in planning to our day which made our visit a memorable one. The dining staff provided excellent service and the meals were deliciousssssss. Afternoon tea is a must! One of the best hotels we've ever stayed in."
December 2016,Luxurious hotel with excellent service,"My daughter and I stayed at this luxurious hotel which was tastefully decorated in classic British style.  From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with warm and friendly staff.  Our room was beautiful and cozy with all the amenities including comfy bathrobes and slippers.  The concierge staff was extremely helpful in planning our day which made our visit a memorable one.  The dining staff provided excellent service and the meals were delicious.   Afternoon tea is a must!  One of the best hotels we've ever stayed in."
February 2017,Milestone Magnificence,"My partner and I stayed at the Milestone Hotel, Kensington for 3 nights in Dec 2016.  The hotel is wonderfully historic and the staff are wonderfully supportive and attentive.  Our room was small but very serviceable (2nd floor.)  Please note - the pillows are very soft but the staff will switch out upon request.  Even though my ""dual voltage"" hair appliance did create a small flame and singe my hair, the staff weren't outwardly judgemental and even offered house devices to use or also to purchase a new device (local voltage) like mine for use during the rest of my stay.  Although the hotel kept requesting access to clean our room, for environmental purposes (less water, detergent, electricty usage) we declined access until the end of our stay.  I hope in future the hotel will‚Ä¶"
February 2017,Attentive service,"Multiple stays at the Milestone, always with pleasure and gratitude for the high level of attention and the kindness of the staff.  The public rooms are gracious; breakfasts are wonderful; the rooms are comfortably appointed.  The spa/gym area is small, but efficiently organized."
February 2017,Top hotel,"We spend four nights at this hotel.  It deserves its high ranking.  We had Room 105 - pretty much adjacent to the elevator, but you did not hear it.  The room was reasonably spacious for London.  Nice TV with many channels.  The bathroom was very large and very well appointed.  Spectacular is a good word to describe the bathroom.  We used the hotel as a base for sightseeing.  It's about a five minute walk to the Kensington High Street tube stop.  Very nice neighborhood between the hotel and the tube.  The staff was very professional.  We did not partake in any of the amenities offered by the hotel, but I would expect that they are first rate.  We arrived after 11 PM and registration was prompt and without incident.  It was quite cold outside, but the hotel and our room were well‚Ä¶"
January 2017,Wow. We're spoiled forever. ,"We're still here (me with my 16-yr old son) and may never leave. At the very least, I can assure you we may never have an experience like this again. What a hotel! Or, as the spectacular staff refers to it, our ""home."" This is 5 star luxury, with almost more than we can handle in terms of service.  Rooms are spotless and inviting. We're walking and standing all day, and to come back to this magnificence is just delightful!  The staff is perfect. Every one of them is prepared to help in any and every way. Then we have the amenities including the perfect beds, oversized towels, giant screen TV, a newspaper delivered each morning, and the stillness that allows for a nap when needed.   This place is a treat. "
February 2017,Ooh yea,-Exceptional customer service. Staff is super friendly and superprofessional   -Great design of rooms and lobby. The overall ambiance is on a noticeably high level.  -Great facilities such as swimming pool and GYM  -Location is very convenient
April 2016,Any excuse to experience the friendly atmosphere!,"I am lucky to have the opportunity to visit the Milestone Hotel fairly regularly! ALWAYS such a friendly welcome from all the personnel. If you find yourself in the Kensington area and want a delightful break from the hustle & bustle of the great city - Visit the Milestone Hotel - just for a coffee, a visit to the bar or a delightful meal all served by professional and FRIENDLY staff. (Or of course just to pass the  time of day with Patricio at the door)  "
April 2016,Gorgeous hotel in superb location,"Stayed at the Milestone for our wedding anniversary. The staff were sure to notice our anniversary, we were left with lovely goodies in the room on arrival.   Hotel is in a fantastic location right opposite Kensington gardens.  Will be back again!"
February 2017,Best hotel in London,"I stayed at the Milestone awhile back and completely forgot to give it a review.  The Milestone is, by far, the best hotel in London. The service is top-notch and second to none. They went out of their way to ensure we were happy with every aspect of our stay. The rooms are very large (by London standards) and tastefully decorated in a traditionally formal manner. We had dinner at the hotel restaurant and it was fantastic. The location also cannot be beat.  All in all - this is one of my favorite hotels in the world. It's like stepping back in time :-). "
January 2017,Exceptional Service,"If you are looking to be in a large hotel, this is not the place for you, but if you are looking for a taste of London at its finest -  the Milestone deserves a worthy mention for exceptional service.  Since we first arrived everything has been impeccable.  For us what makes this hotel stand out from the rest is the level of personal service from everyone we have encountered so far - from Leo who booked my room, Clea who met us at the door and who made sure our stay was enjoyable, the doormen, the wait staff everyone has been friendly and helpful.  Five stars all the way for this"
February 2017,The friendliest hotel ever!,"I have travelled a lot but I have never received such welcoming and friendly treatment from a hotel as the Milestone!  From the open bar due to our rooms not being ready (it was new years day and guests were late to leave) to the smiles and friendly manner of the staff throughout our 9 night stay, it was almost like staying with long lost family.  In fact one staff member suggested we treat the hotel as our home.  The staff were amazing you could not fault them and the rooms were lovely and comfortable.    Our stay was more memorable  when another guest made one night quite unbearable (no fault of the hotel and not despite their best efforts to shut the guest down).  The manager moved us to the largest suite in the hotel (the Tudor Suite). It more than made up for a bad night's‚Ä¶"
May 2016,Not enough great words to describe the Milestone,"The Milestone has been on my bucket list of hotels for several years.  I had very high expectations, and I was not disappointed!  We booked a car from the hotel to pick us up at the airport.  Our driver, Colin, was great!  He made us feel very welcome and gave us lots of information on the ride to the hotel.  When we checked in, we were told we had been upgraded to a deluxe king room.  The room was so quaint and charming, and the decor was perfect for us!  The room overlooked Kensington Gardens.  It was delightful to look out over the park every morning and evening. I had read so many glowing reviews about the hotel staff, and all of them proved to be true!  From housekeeping to the front desk, the concierge to the restaurant staff, they are all so friendly and ready help.  We‚Ä¶"
November 2016,Exceptional Service and Great Location,"This hotel has everything you need to make your stay in London a pleasure. First, service is exceptional. The facility is immaculate and the staff warm, efficient and accommodating. Next, the location is ideal - right around the corner from the Tube, lots of shopping, restaurants, attractions and parks. Spent 6 days at the Milestone on business/pleasure and will certainly return the next time I am in town."
October 2016,Wonderful wedding. ,"My youngest daughter had her wedding reception at the Milestone. 6 of us stayed for 2 nights. We were upgraded on some of the rooms, the bride and groom had a suite, which was beautiful.  The whole process of organising the reception was easy and stress free. It was only a small wedding but it still needed to be perfect. We were given a champagne reception by the hotel, a lovely gesture. There were 4 vegans to be catered for and the head chef was brilliant with suggestions. Each of the 5 courses was delicious.  We had 9 people for breakfast, the morning after the wedding, and so were given the use of the room where the reception was held. This meant we could be as noisy as we liked and not upset other guests. There's nothing worse than a group of boisterous people when you are‚Ä¶"
November 2016,Service beyond compare,"The staff of this hotel are always ready with a genuine smile, and will do whatever needs to be done to make your stay the best it can be. Notable are the Concierge Andrea, and the doorman Steven, whom both were the epitome of professional, as well as friendly in help with transportation to and from meetings, restaurants suggestions for business, as well as ideas for downtime based on my schedule and preferences. The hotel itself is comfortable, impeccably maintained,with proximity to whatever your reason for visiting may be. The restaurant offers tea time, the bar is cozy... the  fantastic service is what you'll remember most."
October 2016,Fabulous!,"Unfortunately, our stay was for one night only - we would have loved to have stayed longer at this wonderful hotel.  On arrival, around 1.00 pm, our room wasn't ready so we were escorted to the bar and provided with complimentary champagne - what a lovely introduction to the Milestone Hotel!    We were later escorted to our room which was sumptuously furnished with beautiful fabrics and linens.  A personalised welcome card, signed by the manager, was in the room, together with a box of handmade biscuits, a box of teabags and, rather strangely, a single, beautifully wrapped prune!  Nice touches.  The bathroom was spacious and plenty of fluffy, white towels were provided.  Penhaligon toiletries were plentiful.  We experienced a slight fly in the ointment when we went for a drink‚Ä¶"
October 2016,"Outstanding Hospitality, Loverly Hotel","This may just be the perfect London hotel. My husband and I have stayed in many hotels in London, however none had the client service and hospitality of the Milestone. Everything about our stay was delightful. Matthew in reception was very friendly and did all he could to accommodate us with an early check-in. The room was beautifully decorated and the king bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was a nice size and high quality toiletries were replenished every day. Complimentary coffee was delivered to our room following an early morning wake-up call. What a wonderful detail! The breakfast service was lovely. We had the continental so can't comment on the full breakfast. The coffee was very good as well as the fresh orange juice and all the cereals, yogurts, breads and‚Ä¶"
October 2016,Elegant and friendly,"The hotel is within ten minutes of High Street Kensington subway station and just across the street form Kensington park.  The room was well appointed and quiet.  Room service delivered a paper each morning and turned down the bed each evening.    The concierge was extremely helpful, acquiring tickets to a sold out show and giving exacting directions to various sights.    The food was excellent.  Our day started with a superb breakfast.  Hight tea was also a must.  This hotel will be what we measure other hotels against for excellence."
November 2015,Most beautiful hotel and staff! ,"This hotel group demonstrates customer service at its absolute best.   It is literally the best ever experience I have ever had, this and the sister hotels are always 1,2 or 3 on TripAdvisor book your stay to find out why even if it's for 1 night!"
November 2016,An outstanding stay at The Milestone,"Loved this hotel so much, so beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough for you,really made the stay more memorable! Would go back again 100%! Can highly recommend anyone to have a stay here, worth the money. "
November 2016,Fabulous afternoon tea,"My husband and 4 grown sons spent Thanksgiving weekend at the Milestone and it was truly a magical experience! The rooms were spacious, and beautifully appointed with up to date amenities (including the bathrooms), while  the charming decor mirrors the old world style of the hotel. Breakfast, (included with our rooms) was more than substantial ( a beautiful buffet was served and additional menu items cooked to order were available.   The staff was top notch and made sure our stay was an experience to remember and every need was met. Leo, the Duty manager; Jose head concierge;  Andre deputy concierge; Guillaume concierge; Magda, the breakfast hostess and many more all excelled at their jobs!  The Milestone's location is perfect because it is directly across the street from lovely‚Ä¶"
December 2016,"Great hotel, great location","We visited this hotel for afternoon tea to celebrate my sisters 65th birthday there were 7 of us and we were looked after very well. We had a lovely table and the food was delicious and plentiful. All the staff from the young lady who greeted us to the concierge made us very welcome. A very special mention to Fabrizio, Andreas, Lukas and Malcolm the pianist who played all our requests. I would recommend this hotel and would visit again."
February 2016,Absolutely amazing,"Spent two nights at this Grade 2 Listed hotel in Kensington, London. Never been there before although I'm familiar with that part of London. Beautifully presented and professionally staffed, it is everything I expect from a high end hotel. The room was comfortable and well appointed, the food delicious and the location - directly opposite Kensington Gardens (an extension of Hyde Park) and a few minutes walk from Harrods, three of London's great museums and much else besides, made it, for us, a perfect place to stay. BUT - be warned - the huge afternoon tea could sink a battle ship."
November 2016,Incredible London hotel,"I absolutely enjoyed my stay at The Milestone and it is not The last time I'll be visiting.  The service, The style, The suite - everything was Perfect!  I enjoyed three days at this amazing property and it was worth every penny!   They have The most wondeful breakfast and bar as well.   5 Stars is Way underestimated!"
October 2016,Brilliant Customer Service,"Thank you for such a fantastic night's stay! All members of staff made the stay incredible memorable and enjoyable, including the customer relations manager on arrival, the housekeeping staff for an immaculately clean and imaginative bedroom, Augustin was such a wonderful host of a waiter for dinner and the smoked salmon and Dover Sole was simply scrumptious! A sensational hotel with amazing staff."
October 2016,Anniversary stay ,"We arrived late Saturday afternoon and used the valet parking, very helpful and efficient friendly chap, who helped us with luggage and parked the car very easily. Check in, reception very friendly, we had a tour of the beautiful hotel and then to our room, the gentleman was very helpful with our belongings and making sure the room was comfortable. Very comfortable stay our room was very well decorated, very clean and exceptionally comfortable. The hotel made sure our every need was catered too including lavender pillows and memory foam. We used the leisure facilities which were lovely and breakfast was spectacular. A very lovely stay. "
September 2016,Excellent stay,"We stayed as a treat for our anniversary. The hotel is gorgeous. Staff are amazing, very friendly and welcoming, but also very professional. The cocktails in the bar are delicious and the room was stunning. Very comfy and well decorated with the theme of the hotel. Pool and sauna well tucked away but very relaxing and breakfast in the morning was one of the nicest I've had anywhere. Would thoroughly recommend and will always use this for stays in London. 5 stars well deserved."
October 2016,Blueprint for outstanding customer service.,"Everything about this hotel is 5 plus stars. We stayed 4 nights with 2 other couples at Milestone on an Insight Luxury Gold vacation package. We also stayed at a 5 star boutique hotel in Paris. There was no comparison. Milestone is in a class by itself. All of us felt appreciated and comfortable.  The staff are always there to help and make you feel like a valued guest. It's clean, beautify decorated with an excellent breakfast menu. Housekeeping is exceptional but make sure you hang the card on the door saying the room is ready. We forgot one day and it wasn't made up until 8:30 that night. We have stayed at numerous 5 star properties and Milestone is the best."
October 2016,Great Boutique Hotel and Amazing Service,"My wife and I recently spent a long weekend in London and had such a wonderful time at the Milestone. While the hotel is little pricey, it is well worth it based off of service, location and facilities.  Service -I can only use one word to describe- unbelievable. Everyone was so nice and attentive, it was worth the price itself. You felt a different vibe at this hotel vs. some of the large chains that are available in every city. People would greet you by name and would go out of their way to speak with you and help you get where you needed to go.  Location -The hotel is located on the Southwest corner of Hyde Park and is less than a five minute walk to Kensington Palace. The park is easy to navigate and is so beautiful. As New Yorkers, we loved walking through the different‚Ä¶"
November 2016,Best Service and Cutest Hotel,I stayed at the Milestone for 4 nights on a trip with my friends.  It was one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in and the service was unbeatable - he wake up call in the morning comes with delicious coffee and/or tea and the concierge is extremely helpful.  The milestone truly felt like my home for the four days i stayed there.  I Will definitely be back here again!
July 2016,Traditional and beautiful!,"I am new to Trip Advisor but just wanted to comment at the fantastic service at the Milestone. Went for afternoon tea for my mum's 50th. It was well organised, relaxed & the hotel itself is absolutely beautiful. They even gave us a tour around the hotel after our tea so we could see the rooms and facilities they provide. One of the best afternoon teas I've been to! Definitely recommend. Thank you for the fantastic service! Could not fault it in the slightest..."
October 2016,Beautiful suite,"Stayed for one night for a little weekend break with my partner, and it was amazing.  We had a drink at the hotel bar on our arrival, and were informed there was an error with our booking. They instead upgraded us to one of suites, which was an incredibly beautiful room. It was spread across two floors, with a seating area upstairs as well as ""hidden"" bathroom and walk in wardrobe. Below the mezzanine was the bedroom with huge bed and another luxurious bathroom. All the suite was designed very opulently with an old world feel.  Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, and I thoroughly enjoyed my short stay here. Would loved to have stayed for longer, but will definitely return."
July 2016,The Milestone Hotel to the Rescue,"We arrived in London on a rainy Saturday night after an arduous flight from Rome. Our taxi took us to the hotel where we had our booking arranged located in Bloomsbury. We were ready to unpack and relax after a long day. We were greeted instead by a hotel that was boarded up and closed for renovation. We had never been notified inspite of having a confirmed booking. Time to scramble with a taxi meter running! I had stayed at The Montague on the Garden, a Red Carnation Hotel, previously; so we went there since it was nearby. They had no rooms available but offered to call The Milestone. We accepted their offer of a room on the spot. The idea of driving around London on a Saturday night in the rain trying to find a hotel did not appeal. After a 150 GBP cab fare we arrived at The‚Ä¶"
October 2016,A Highlight of our Vacation!,"Family of 3 with an 11 year old boy. We arrived in a taxi and when the doorman opened the door, he greeted us by name. They had no idea when we were arriving (and presumably no idea what we looked like). That first impression properly set the stage for a two-night stay in one of the only hotels we have ever raved about. Truthfully, we found the room slightly small, but everything else was 6-star service. Amazingly friendly staff who knew us, multiple people who bent over backwards to assist us with dinner and travel reservations, personal care appointments, the works. Bartenders remembered what we like to drink. Maid service added special touches for each of us. The Milestone was simply amazing up and down. And even when they were fully booked for the afternoon tea, they created‚Ä¶"
October 2016,A wonderful experience,"My husband and I recently spent 2 nights at The Milestone and had a marvelous stay. I selected the hotel due to its proximity to The Royal Albert Hall as we had tickets to a performance. We had previously stayed at other Red Carnation properties so were familiar with the high standard of service and attention to detail, again we were not disappointed. From our initial welcome to our final goodbye the staff were superb - professional, courteous and could not do enough to assist. Our room was comfortable and cosy with so many well thought out details and the bathroom very spacious and well stocked. I loved the nightly turn down service with different sweets left each night. Breakfast was excellent and on our second morning  4 couples arrived at once to an already busy dining room‚Ä¶"
October 2016,Exceptional Stay,"From the moment my wife & I entered the Milestone we were overwhelmed by the courtesy of all the staff. An example & a fantastic gesture was an immediate upgrade in room, due to our Silver Wedding Anniversary celebration (thank you once again).  The attention to detail tells you everything about this Hotel, spotless, articulate, precise and thoughtful. (Rose petals and candles in the bedroom on the night of our anniversary was lovely).  Ideally located for the Royal Albert Hall, the Tube and Kensington Gardens this is an exceptional hotel. "
October 2016,The Milestone Hotel,"The hotel, opened in the 1920s, takes its name from the old cast iron milestone that stands outside and comprises three tall Victorian townhouses, the first of which, No 1 Kensington Court, has fine original features, including carved window frames and a black-and-white tiled floor. It stands on busy Kensington Road, near where it becomes Kensington High Street, with views of Kensington Park opposite. The hotel is small scale: with minimal outside space, cosy public rooms, including a very pretty Victorian style sitting room, and bedrooms on five floors. The decoration, in the style of Red Carnation‚Äôs owner and chief designer, Beatrice Tollman, is expansive, generous and elaborate, spilling over into fussiness, especially in such a small space, with flowing fabrics, cushions,‚Ä¶"
October 2016,Wouldnt stay anywhere else in London!,"We stayed for my husbands 50th birthday, and it was fantastic. We were upgraded on arrival. Staff friendly, attentive and there to please the guests (they are passionate about their jobs, and this shows in the level of service received from all)  The rooms are beautifully luxurious, scrupulously clean, and everything has been considered to make your stay wonderful. Turn down service with nightly treats, stunning Penhaligon toiletries and anything extra thats required is seen to immediately.  A  complimentary birthday cake was left in our room, and a birthday card, we also had complimentary champagne during our afternoon tea. A truly magical stay......thank you."
October 2016,Exceptional Service!,"Everything about the Milestone was beyond our greatest expectations.  I have traveled many places and stayed in 5 star hotels but this trip was extra special.  Everything from the location, staff and rooms were top notch.  I am a stickler for customer service and The Milestone staff did not disappoint.  They are amazing!  We stayed for 8 nights and never got tired of the fantastic breakfasts and the delicious evening treats.  I highly recommend the chicken pot pie."
October 2016,"Professional, personalized, and posh","Booked a stay at this hotel for an anniversary trip to London and we absolutely enjoyed our stay from start to finish. Our original booking was upgraded for us as a nice ""anniversary present"" and we couldn't have been more pleased. Our room had a king-sized bed, large flat screen tv, large closet and dresser, and bathtub large enough to soak in. I'm not sure if they have an evening maid service, but it was so nice to come home after a day of sightseeing to find that our slippers were set out by the bed, an evening treat on the coffee table, and soft music playing for us.   The location is a short walk to the Kensingston High Street underground station and all our taxi drivers knew of the hotel which made coming back home incredibly easy. Across from the hotel is Kensington‚Ä¶"
October 2016,Business or Pleasure Always Exceptional,"Have stayed here 3 times each time surpassing the previous stay for comfort, location, room quality and staff The Cheneston offers superb cuisine, prepared and plated masterfully. Many nights ended with a Vintage Port in the Bar The staff go out of their way to meet every request with a smile and prompt solution! All in all a superb stay every time.   And I love Kensington!!!!"
October 2016,Our favorite London hotel,"The Milestone is our go-to hotel on every visit to London. It is exquisite and the staff and service are exemplary.  It's hard to describe the wonderful experience that the Milestone provides and the quality and decor of it's accommodations. It well deserves its five star rating and while, like much of London, it is expensive, we have found that they do offer deals and have been upgraded on each visit.  Their restaurant is of high quality as is their high tea and evening lounge. Located directly across from Kensington Palace and Park, the home of William and Kate and in the shopping and restaurants of Kensington."
March 2016,Absolutely Excellent! (from a discerning traveler),"We stayed in Oct 16 to celebrate our wedding anniversary and to visit Frieze / Frieze Masters.  Exceptional quality, exceptional professionalism and thoughtful, personal touch in every respect.  Great location.  We have traveled the world and rarely stay at the same place twice.  We look forward to returning to the Milestone.  Thank you Andrea (concierge) and Colin (chauffeur) and team for making our stay so special."
September 2016,Beautiful place,"We have stayed in the Maidstone apartment with our kids. We had 2 bedrooms, a living room, kitchen and used all of the hotel's amenities. Service was amazing and we felt we just lived in London, away from the tourist scene."
September 2016,Excellent stay...loved it!,What a great stay in a lovely hotel! Location was perfect and main attractions within walking distance....service from the time I arrived to the time I left was amazing and exceptional.....loved my room with a gorgeous view of Kensington gardens.....will return again one day!
October 2016,Yet Again Another Great Stay,"We stayed at the Milestone at the beginning of September for my husband's 40th Birthday, this was our second stay and again it was another fabulous experience. We arrived around 3:30 and our room wasn't yet ready so they gave us a glass of champagne for having to wait (this was on top of our welcome drink). It was so nice to relax and have a lovely glass of bubbly. We were then taken up to our beautiful room which was so well appointed. The point of our stay was to relax and that's exactly what we did. I had a lovely bath in the beautifully large bathroom before getting ready to head out to dinner. Our room had a choice of two different type of bathrobes which was a very nice touch. One thing to note is that we had an issue with the temperature in our room and we flagged it with‚Ä¶"

August 2016,Amazing hotel!,"The staff was very polite, food was fantastic also. All in All I would rate this hotel 5 out of 5 stars! I was with my family, everyone liked the environment, people were friendly. We spent hours in the cozy lounge area. The hotel is tastefully and thoughfully decorated."
October 2016,"Lovely historical mansion, perfectly located near parks and  many points of interest","The Milestone Hotel  has wonderful and helpful staff who did everything to make our stay in London carefree and fun. Our room was simply  beautiful and reminiscent of ""Downton Abbey"" elegance, hospitality and service - sans pretention!   The  restaurant meals were delicious and the daily marvelous continental breakfasts were included at no extra cost.  Truly  the best hotel experience I  have ever had."
June 2016,Another Red Carnation group triumph,"We are slowly adding to our Red Carnation group London stays.  The latest was the Milestone Hotel in Kensington.  The welcome was friendly and efficient.  Our room was beautifully furnished with little treats set out for us.  We had a view over Hyde Park, a superbly comfortable bed and a sumptuous bathroom.  Breakfast in bed was a special treat and my Eggs Benedict were outstandingly delicious.  Little touches like having freshly squeezed grapefruit juice give this hotel its well-deserved reputation.  Comfort and service and a light touch of gentility- thank you!"
September 2016,WOW! A lovely high end hotel!,We came for our anniversary and we let them know ahead of time. They were fabulous and upgraded us. The rooms have so much character you feel like home.  If my home was professionally decorated of course! ;) They gave us a tour and told us some interesting history about the building... ask if you dare! We used our chase points to spoil ourselves and spoiled we were! the breakfast was lovely and full of choices. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!
June 2016,Wonderful experience!,"The Milestone is simply a gem. The rooms are beautifully appointed and spotlessly clean.  The small details are delightful.  For example, instead of the usual generic piece of bedtime chocolate, we found a different, beautifully packaged treat every night.  As well, there was always a live red carnation in our bathroom and a small orchid arrangement in our bedroom. The turndown service is exceptional, with fresh towels twice a day if one wants.  The staff is extremely welcoming, professional and eager to help with the smallest request.   The afternoon tea rivals any we've had at Brown's or the Connaught.  The tea room is  small but frankly, the calm and peaceful ambiance was welcome. The food offerings are generous and delicious. I highly recommend the Milestone to anyone who‚Ä¶"
June 2016,Great service at a great location,"Our recent stay at The Milestone was fantastic.  The service was top notch and left nothing to be desired.  We relied heavily on the entire staff, particularly the concierge and butler staffs, and were never disappointed with a recommendation.  And while not child- or family-focused, the staff at the hotel went above and beyond for our young children, making the stay much easier and more enjoyable on their parents.  We will certainly be back; it would be difficult to stay in another London hotel."
June 2016,Oh what a hotel! Would love to come back whenever in London,we stayed in Apt. # 4 which is one of the better among their 6 apartments. The apartment was ready before time(they said 6pm but it was ready at 2 when we reached) No request was too much for them. Our continental breakfast was included but they made it a full breakfast. The concierge was wonderful and extremely helpful. Service was excellent. Truly we were pampered.
May 2016,The best hotel!,I can't say enough wonderful things about this hotel.  My parents and daughters and I  stayed at the Milestone Hotel this month and enjoyed every minute.  We ate breakfast at the hotel every day and also ate 2 dinners at the hotel and the food was fantastic.  We also had afternoon tea which was also delicious.  The hotel itself is small but I think that lends itself to letting the staff personalize your stay.  They were welcoming every day when we returned from sightseeing and even surprised us one late afternoon with a delivery of homemade scones to our room.  The staff is so friendly and helpful and can't do enough to make sure that your stay is comfortable.  You can tell that they all love what they do.  The location was convenient to the tube stop and within walking distance‚Ä¶
June 2016,Birthday Decadence,"My husband and I recently travelled to England and Scotland for our 60 birthday celebration.  Staying at the Milestone Hotel was a most fabulous way to celebrate and visit London!  The entire staff was attentive to our every need or question, the food was wonderful and our suite was beyond expectation - nothing was left unattended.  The location by Kensington Place and the beautiful park puts it in quite a wonderful location - close by not too close to everything we wanted to see and do.  Nightly little surprises on our bed, beautiful white monogrammed towels and a comfortable bed made our stay at the Milestone one we won't soon forget!"
June 2016,Excellent Wedding Lunch & Accommodation ,"We decided to have our wedding lunch and spend our wedding night at this hotel after considering many offers in London.  And it was the Best Decision Ever üéâüéâüéâüéâüéâ  Many thanks to: Florinda, Ben, Leo & Magda for making such special day even more special."
July 2015,"5 stars, but bring your wallet!","Set literally across the street from Kensington palace and the park, the hotel has impeccable service as one would expect at this level. Now, you are in a major Capitol city, and prices and room size reflects that. But the rooms are lovely, the bath was up-to-date and you have the usual perks. 24 hour concierge, 24 hour room service, restaurant on site, along with a small bar, free wifi, cable TV, complimentary coffee or tea wake up service, and a very helpful and accommodating staff. We did not eat there except for a light breakfast on arrival (excellent) and some room service soup (not good). There are many eating options within walking distance as well as a Whole Foods that has not only a hot food bar, but several restaurants above. We had breakfast and several bowls of soup‚Ä¶"
May 2016,birthday treat,I stayed here with my son and his partner in the African room..excellent service ..i stayed in there room and had to have a put up bed which I didn't mind but I expected it more of a comfy one in standing with such a high hotel.We were going the ritz for afternoon tea but decided to take it at the milestone instead...excellent and we even got..a compliment for dressing up for the occasion.. ..Breakfast was fine except for bacon been over done well worth the treat
June 2016,"Amazing Service, beautiful accomodation and treated like Royalty","We arrived in time for Afternoon Tea (that was amazing) and things just got better and better. The rooms are each decorated differently and all very comfortable and roomy with mine having a view of Kensington Park. Even the trim around windows was historical and interesting, I loved the dragons!!   This is the place to be if you want personal service, accessibility and luxury. The staff make you feel very special any time of the night or day."
June 2016,Outstanding service!,"I stayed at The Milestone and once again received outstanding service particularly from Leo - Duty Manager, Jose - Head Concierge, Matthieu - Reception and the doormen.  The music in the bar was excellent!  Will be back to stay again very soon."
July 2016,"Live like a Queen, or a Princess, at the Milestone","Our stay at the Milestone Hotel in Kensington was superb.  I've never been treated like royalty before but they handled this in a most excellent way.  Everyone that works at the Milestone are the most personable and pleasant people I've met in my travels.  Every day as we ventured out we felt like we were leaving the family at home.  Coming home in the evenings after a day of beautiful weather and adventures, we were greeted by each and every one we passed.  How lovely a visit and we intend to return."
July 2016,Great stay in London!!!!,Overall the best hotel stay. The staff welcomed us HOME everytime we returned.  The housekeeping staff picked up and replaced towel twice daily what a dream. Jose got us GREAT theatre tickets and made a wonderful resturant pick for Indian food. I would highly recommend and what a great location.
July 2016,Impeccable!,"My wife and I stayed at The Milestone for one night, partly to celebrate a wedding anniversary. The hotel was faultless. Every single member of staff was genuinely friendly and entirely professional. The room was perfect, as were all the little, unexpected touches, such as a chocolate cake to celebrate our anniversary; the mini books (abridged Shakespeare and Dickens) placed on our pillows at night; and even the card placed by our bed showing tomorrow's weather forecast.   Whilst this hotel is not cheap, there is no question that you get what you pay for here. The customer service was the best I had ever experienced at any hotel. We were immediately made to feel welcome and comfortable. We were treated as valued guests.   In short, this hotel is outstanding!"
December 2015,A Crown Jewel!,"This is a very special hotel with a great staff that makes everything possible. It has the dark wood inside and traditional decor which i was not sure about at first,  but loved it within a day. The staff is soooooo amazing!!! The front desk, Chloe is fantastic, the concierge and the bellmen, the kitchen(24 hours!) laundry service--all superb. They were excellent with my kids picky menu desires and made it happen. What a total pleasure!!! Thank you from my heart!!!"
July 2016,Quintessentially British,Perfect location across from Hyde Park in South Kensington. The Milestone is a boutique hotel with beautiful rooms and attentive staff. The back area bar was perfect for drinks or tea. Room service was available (even their late night menu after hours). Their Holiday decorations around Christmas are stunning. Have stayed here multiple times and would definitely go back.
July 2016,Fabulous Luxury Hotel,"Stayed here as attending a concert in Hyde Park, so an excellent location. Received complimentary drinks on arrival. Staff were really nice and helpful, and friendly, which you sometimes don't experience in a hotel of this standard. Rooms were first class. I unfortunately left my room in a hurry and left it untidy. When I returned everything had been tidied up. Luxury toiletries and slippers are also provided. We booked afternoon tea which was of a very high standard and included champagne. The waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the tea, sandwiches and cakes. We also had breakfast the following morning which again was first class and the selection included everything you could possibly want. This is a five star hotel so would not be affordable for everyone but it‚Ä¶"
July 2016,"Wonderful stay, just perfect!","I researched for hours before booking a hotel in London & was extremely satisfied with my choice. We stayed here for a week & the location is excellent. You can see all of the sites within a few tube or bus stops and then return to the tranquility of the Kensington Park area. Next, the staff went beyond to make our first trip to London an amazing experience for my daughter & I. The breakfast & afternoon tea were delicious and once again the staff of servers were so accommodating, they couldn't do enough for us. The staff took a genuine interest, particularly Clea & Chloe, in making sure every part of our stay was amazing. Clea even went so far as to writing my teenage daughter a beautiful card & leaving tennis decorated cupcakes in our room on the night we returned from‚Ä¶"
June 2016,This is the best small luxury hotel in the world ,"I have to travel for work all over the world so over the years I have been to some pretty fabulous hotels. But none match the Milestone.   I had my wedding here a few years ago and yesterday I hosted a party for 40 guests for my Mum. Everything was faultless and perfect. The food, staff, service, room and organisation was so good that it meant that I could relax and enjoy the special afternoon. The staff at this hotel seem to really care about what they do, and they care about their guests too. Nothing is too much.   In particular Grant Cockburn, food and beverage manager, and David and Augustine deserve special mentions. Grant was simply wonderful and actually he helped make my Mum's reception really special. I cannot thank the Milestone team enough. This is a very special‚Ä¶"
July 2016,Delightful,"We stayed here 4 nights in early June. My wife and I both thought this was our best trip to London, ever, and we credit our stay at the Milestone for our epic enjoyment of the city. I used to think that in places like London the hotel doesn't matter. That what's outside the hotel is all that matters. But London is such a large and busy city. It not only has a lot to give, but takes a lot out of you as well - energy, physical activity, brain activity, emotional activity, etc. Because this hotel is located across the street from Kensington Gardens, the gardens are basically your backyard and you can enjoy strolls along and in it at any time. it's a nice break from the plays, museums, monuments, and shopping. And the hotel itself is a bastion of respite, hospitality at it's best,‚Ä¶"
June 2016,How do they recruit such remarkable staff?,Just returned from this hotel. Didn't want to leave. All the team made you feel like a regular guest. As a first time visitor with a dog in tow we could not believe the warmth of the welcome. Chloe checked us in. Pedro showed us around. Benjamin served our dog friendly supper in the stylish conservatory. David served our afternoon tea which was superb. Marvin helped with umbrellas and bag storing. Leo checked us out.  We had a lovely chatty lady who brought us breakfast in the room.  Everything in the room worked beautifully. Even the Sky TV remote was in a sterilized bag! The hotel's attention to detail is meticulous but it was so casual and friendly that Nero was encouraged to sit on the sofa. Thank you to everyone who helped our stay along. Apologies if we missed you by name.‚Ä¶
July 2016,A brilliant hotel in a perfect location that feels like home,"We stayed in the 'Rooftops' apartment - Apartment 6. This is the only one that is effectively three bedroom, with the third bedroom being a lovely little loft room.   This apartment also has an excellent roof terrace that, like the rest of the apartment, is isolated from the noise of the main road and feels like a sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of London.  The staff are excellent, nothing is too much trouble.  Its an old building, meaning the rooms are smaller, the place has age (in a good way). We came to London to feel the history of the place, and this hotel lets you live within that history, in the nicest sense.  We've tried their great afternoon tea (do *not* eat lunch beforehand) and enjoyed their lovely breakfasts.  But it really is about location (unbeatable -‚Ä¶"
July 2016,Fabulous family-friendly stay,"I spent two glorious nights at the Milestone with my two boys and cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. From the unexpected upgrade to a larger room, to delicious treats for the boys, from the booking of a lovely sitter for our boys to games and water each time we walked out the door to scooter in Kensington Gardens, their staff was fabulous, responsive and so welcoming. The hotel is beautiful as well as extremely comfortable. We were made to feel as if it was our home in London and what a location directly across from Kensington Gardens! A perfect spot for families. We cannot wait for our next trip to London and our stay at The Milestone! "
July 2016,Lovely,"The Reason We picked this hotel was the location and the reviews, so because of this are expectations were high. We arrived and checked in no issues, we were shown to our room and it was lovely but a little cramped. We unpacked then thought we'd take a nap. The stains on the bed base and headboard were questionable. I felt unhappy as I was disappointed. My husband went and quietly spoke to manager and he came to the room to look. He immediately himself was shocked and stated that this had been overlooked and moved us immediately to a junior suite! The door man and concierge moved all our belongings so we didn't have to do it. The guest recovery was immediate and exceptional. Breakfast was amazing and a treat every morning. Our friends arrived the day after and loved it to. The‚Ä¶"
June 2016,"Negvesky, MD","The Milestone is hands down, one of the finest hotels in entire UK.  The hotel exudes British tradition and elegance--exactly how I wanted my US based family to experience true British culture.  The staff at this boutique hotel are brilliant--- geniuses in hospitality.   Shortened our stay at the Royal Crescent in Bath, when our oldest daughter developed a respiratory illness. We rushed back to Milestone, where they had arranged a first class Private Physician to examine my daughter on our arrival to the hotel in our own room.  We were out of our country and really needed guidance and immediate help, although we were in Bath, the Milestone Managment was the first placed we turned and trusted in an emergency situation----it was a blessing to have the amazing staff of a hotel take‚Ä¶"
July 2016,A Great Hotel Experience,"The Milestone is a wonderful boutique hotel across from Hyde Park.  We were greeted warmly at the car and again by the front desk.  All of the staff are helpful and very nice.  Everyone seemed to genuinely care that we had a remarkable stay. The hotel is beautiful and fascinating.  There is every modern convenience in the setting of an elegant, sort of art deco hotel.  Our room was spacious (Jr. suite), with a balcony and a glorious bathroom!  I highly recommend this location and hotel."
July 2016,Best Hotel in London,"I cannot express in words how magnificent our short stay was at The MIlestone hotel in London.  It was truly the best three days of our two week European vacation.  The individual attention to detail by every single member of their staff is incredible! From the welcoming gifts, to the attention we received on our late arrival at 2am, the daily room service and wonderful breakfast, the delicious surprise birthday cake delivered when we were experiencing afternoon tea at the hotel and my complimentary bottle of birthday champagne, to the concierge desk sending up Pokemon cupcakes to my daughters‚Äô room after discussing the new Pokemon Go app around the city earlier in the morning.  We always felt like we were the only the guests in the hotel despite the other guests around us. ‚Ä¶"
June 2016,Amazing stay at the Milestone,"Great service, amazing staff, and great location made for an amazing stay.  Would completely recommend the Milestone for a romantic weekend or ideal location to see the parks and sites of the west side of London."
June 2016,"High quality and fantastic location, but overpriced?","The Milestone is a very good hotel in all aspects: Excellent location, good service, and good standard throughout. However, good is not excellent. The hotel lacks the special touch and very attentive service level you would expect at a hotel of this standard. The price promises excellence, but the experience is not fully there. So what you eventually pay for is good comfort and quality at a fantastic location - close to everything in London."
May 2016,Friendliest boutique hotel in London,"Absolute gem. Beautiful surroundings and the friendliest staff. We were in London for a family vacation, spending a week in London and a few days in Paris. The Milestone did not disappoint. The folks there really cared about providing the best experience for our large group. There were twelve of us staying in six rooms and each of us felt like we were royalty. From Andreas help in planning our excursions to Head Doorman Steve Thornett's unmatched knowledge of the local surroundings, you will not find a better place to stay in London."
June 2016,Absolutely fabulous wedding anniversary stay....,"This was our second w/e away since our daughter was born 14m ago. From the minute we arrived the staff were exceptionally friendly and welcoming. The reception staff were helpful and made sure we were aware of all local amenities. We were given a tour of the hotel after which we had a relaxing welcome glass of champagne at the bar. The ambiance of the entire hotel is friendly and relaxing. We were upgraded to a suit which was absolutely fabulous. The bed was extremely comfortable... So much so we returned for an afternoon nap! The turn down service was the best we'd ever experienced and we have travelled a lot. When we returned to our room that evening we were greeted with a handwritten card and an array of complimentary chocolates, strawberries and hot drinks.  Our stay was‚Ä¶"
June 2016,Fabulous stay!,"i was lucky enough for my husband to book a stay at The Milestone (and to see Swan Lake at The Albert Hall a 10 minute walk away) as a birthday gift. My husband knows that The Milestone has become my favourite hotel. It is indeed a beautiful hotel, but what makes this really special is not just the lovely rooms and personal touches, it is the staff. All of whom are efficient, friendly, helpful, courteous and utterly charming. Everyone went out of their way to ensure that we had a special time. We were so absolutely stunned by an upgrade to The Regency Suite, which was positively gorgeous and we felt even more special. Whatever room you choose at The Milestone you will not be disappointed with The Milestone experience. Thank you again to all the staff for making my birthday gift‚Ä¶"
May 2016,Just as Fabulous after two years!!!,"We recently re-visited The Milestone after a two year break, and to our delight every last detail was exactly as we had remembered, from the welcome at the front door, through lunch, dinner, breakfast and our reluctant departure at Reception the next morning! we regard the hotel as an absolute treat and very much look forward to our next visit."
June 2016,Personal service in the heart of London,"I stayed at the Milestone Hotel for three nights in May 2016. I did ask for every discount imaginable at the time of booking and when I arrived, I was given a free upgrade to a Studio Room. It was just lovely. The big difference between this hotel and the others I stayed at while in London was the personal attention in the Lobby from the concierge, the doorman and the reception desk. The staff were really helpful, giving me tips and directions every morning. The hotel is an old home converted and so it's a very English place. Wonderful experience."
June 2016,What a treat!!,"Amazing personal attentive service. Made us feel like royalty. The food was to die for and the room immaculate. No detail left untouched... Beautiful toiletries, gorgeous decor, could not have picked a better place for hubbies 50th Borthday treat"
July 2016,Simply the BEST!!,We stayed at the Milestone for six nights and LOVED it!  The service was exceptional from our very first contact prior to our stay until the second we walked out the door.  Everyone at the Milestone went above and beyond to assure our satisfaction!   Great location right across the street from Kensington Palace and Hyde Park.  We had an absolutely wonderful experience and a great time!
July 2016,incredible,This is overall the best hotel stay. absolutely impeccable!!! It was the first tim that I stayed in this hotel. I hope to come back very soon in London to stay another time in this place. Good job guys!
July 2016,Attentive service ,"We stayed at the Milestone over a weekend, from Friday to Monday. The customer service is really on the ball and they allowed us to check in early, which was great after an early flight. Dinner in the restaurant was excellent and the service in the bar is really professional. The room was a little disappointing though, stains on the walls where the air con is and all of the furniture was getting tired. It also had a dull drone from the lift ( although not bad enough to lose sleep but ask for a room away from the lift) and the faint aroma of old cigarette smoke. Also, no power point in the bathroom, aside from the usual shaving socket which was a little annoying.... Still, given the excellent service, most of this can be forgiven and the hotel is one of the better places I have‚Ä¶"
June 2016,Home from home in heart of London,"I cannot describe just how wonderful this hotel is. The staff are so friendly and welcoming treating as though you are a friend rather than a customer - and the service they provide is exceptional.  The room (Kensington Suite) was absolutely amazing - on split levels, beautiful decor & furnishings, overlooking the park & everything you could want for a very comfortable stay in London.  We had drinks in the bar (which used to be the stables) and sat in the conservatory, which was very pleasant.  In the evening we drank in the bar and this is cosy and comfortable.  The hotel is not huge like many of the hotels in London and the public rooms on the ground floor meander around so as you feel like you're in a home rather than a grand hotel. Breakfast was very good with a good choice‚Ä¶"
May 2016,In 40 years of travel to Europe I have found no better boutique hotel than London's Milestone.,"I can only imagine what the level of service must be directly across the famous Knightsbridge Road from the Milestone at Kensington Palace, the official residence of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. However I doubt it is better or friendlier than that at the Milestone. Rather than list superlatives let me just say that the ambiance, the rooms, and the restaurant are all 6 Star. In the forty years I have been visiting the UK I have never found a more comfortable, friendly, and luxurious hotel. The restaurant is outstanding I might. Those Americans who might be concerned about haughty or snooty behavior at such an elegant manse need not worry. Everyone is treatred equally regally. Absolutely the place to stay in London!"
January 2016,Caring Staff with Thoughtful Amenities,"Enjoyable one-night stay. Arrived after a long flight and the staff was helpful in getting us settled. Lots of small treats in the room (tea, cookies, etc.) and we appreciated the complimentary coffee with our wake-up call. Small but elaborately decorated room. Perhaps could use a little refreshing in some areas, but it's a historic hotel. Kensington area has a lot to offer and is closer to LHR than some other hotel options in the city."
August 2016,Wow! Now that's what I call service!,Fantastic service all around. We felt like royalty and experienced firsthand the famed British hospitality. The whole place had a charming and cozy feel to it while staying elegant at the same time. The staff are a great asset to this hotel! Stayed for more than a few days and not once had I even the smallest complaint. Thumbs up to the management and staff!
July 2016,Great service with attention to detail,From the moment of Rrival the staff made us feel right at home.   The bedrooms and hotel are both beautifully appointed.  Wifi service works without a glitch.   The high marks for the trip however goes to the concierge staff.   They helped us plan our day-to-day activities and continued to plan for us even while we were gone for the day.  The location is great and only waking distance from the Kensington palace and one block from the public transit station. We highly recommend this hotel and look forward to coming back on a future trip.
August 2016,Outstanding Service,We were staying at the Milestone for the first time as we joined friends who are regular guests. The hotel was elegant and our room - up in the roof was both charming and comfortable. The breakfasts were excellent and set us up for the day - which means I cannot tell you about either lunch or dinner at the Milestone. We did however enjoy bar food and drinks in the evening and found the conservatory a very civilised place to watch the Euro final. What really sets this hotel apart however is the staff. Everyone goes out of their way to help and assist. They are all delightful and are the secret to this hotel's overall charm. We will definitely coming back as soon as we can.
August 2016,Wonderful service and good location,"The Milestone prides itself on customer service, and did not disappoint. All the staff were very helpful, and worked to accommodate special requests. The food was good (we only had tea and breakfast, not dinner). One odd thing was that our room (#104) had no place to unpack small clothing - no chest of drawers, and only one small shelf in the closet. We had been looking forward to not living out of our suitcases for our 3 night stay, but unfortunately couldn't do that. I don't know if the other rooms have drawers or shelves, but perhaps they could fix it because it seemed odd for such an upscale hotel."
August 2016,Sorry to leave...and plan to return ,"The Milestone was recommended by our travel agent, who assured us that this would be a nice hotel in a good location.    The hotel proved to be much more.   We were immediately given a tour of the facility by Clea who was extremely personable, and a rush was put on getting our room ready, as we arrived a couple of hours before standard check-in time.    Our rooms were not large, but not cramped, which is all we expect from a hotel in a crowded city such as London or NYC.   Everything was in working order, and turndown service with a delicious late night snack was provided daily.  Breakfast was included and delicious each morning.    The concierges, especially Andrea, were phenomenal.  They were knowledgable and would help with anything needed.  We called Andrea for a private‚Ä¶"
August 2016,"""We are your home away from home.""","The title of this review is a direct quote from the desk person who checked us in.  He wasn't kidding.  This is a luxury, 5-star, expensive hotel, so you expect it to be great.  It was MORE than great because the people were so nice, friendly and helpful. Sometimes high-end London hotels can be stuffy.  Not the Milestone!  The opposite was true and staff is obviously given the permission -- and time -- to converse with guests.  We stayed there twice (at beginning and end of a trip to England).  We had a wonderful room both times, upgraded to a junior suite both times because we booked through Virtuoso, which offers upgrade if available.  Our suites each time were totally different and both very comfortable with sumptuous baths (though I would have liked a shower separate from‚Ä¶"
August 2016,Amazing,"I have stayed in the Milestone on numerous occasions and absolutely love it here. My hubby booked this as a surprise for my 60th before we flew to Dubai. If I had to go home after my stay here I would not have worried. We were very kindly given an upgrade to the lovely Safari suite. Sooo comfortable with the best bed ever. We had breakfast on both mornings. Excellent We ate here the 1st night and done the afternoon tea on the 2nd day both were delicious. Tasty canap√©s were served in the bar. Staff are fantastic and they truly make this hotel what it is, they really go the extra mile. Thank you to Steven on the door for you little chats and to Leo who gave us a tour of the hotel and then took us to our room. It truly is like a home from home and I could go on and on but just‚Ä¶"
July 2016,Lovely!!!, I have stayed at many hotels in most continents. This place holds a special place in my heart. Last time I was here I was away from home on a super sad trip during Christmas  and the genuine attention I received  from the staff was outstanding  and went way beyond my expectations. Not only did they go above in beyond in what I expect from a hotel but they took it to a whole level by treating me with genuine decency during a very emotional time for me. I can't say enough good things about this place.
July 2016,"Loved this hotel, did not want to leave",We spent 3 nights at the wonderful Milestone.  The staff here is the best!  They treated us so well!  We were there during some of the hottest days of the year and they made me the best ice tea I have had in a long time.  They were so friendly and attentive.  We enjoyed visiting with them and they truly enjoyed visiting with us.  Breakfast was delicious and there was so much variety.  The room was beautiful and it was so nice to enjoy such a wonderful meal there.  The wait staff were friendly and personable and did a great job serving us.  The concierge was always willing to help and gave us suggestions for dinner and made reservations for us.  The doorman always greeted us.  We can not say enough good things about this hotel or the many people that work there! We are so glad we‚Ä¶
June 2016,The excellent Milestone Hotel,"I have stayed in five star hotels throughout the world, and the Milestone Hotel was one of the best I have experienced! It was luxurious,elegant,  comfortable, and the staff tried to anticipate every need. The concierge was especially knowledgeable and helpful, and the food was also excellent. I highly recommend the Milestone Hotel to anyone traveling to the London area."
March 2016,The ultimate British hospitality,"For travelers who wish to experience a real authentic British experience that you read about in story books, the Milestone hotels delivers it big time.  From traditional breakfast and tea, this gem has it all.  It is not a big grand cookie-cutter hotel with a massive lobby full of tourists but a nice boutique property that's a home away from home. Service is outstanding and d√©cor grand with all the modern amenities, wifi, etc."
April 2016,"Family of four, including 2 teenagers","This hotel is superb in every regard. The decor, the service, the amenities, the warmth and the taste of it all is exceptional. The rooms are lovely, as is the bar, restaurant and inviting lounge.?Truly a gem and across from Kensington Park and 5 minutes from beautiful Hyde Park. The staff is both friendly and professional. couldn't ask for a better place. Quiet and tasteful luxury. A great value as well."
April 2016,Stunning hotel in great location,"Excellent service , made to feel very welcome , room was lovely with great view of Kensington gardens. Welcome drink was added bonus and enjoyed our cocktails. The evening meal and breakfast were superb . Would live to stay here again when next in London . As husbands birthday we had champagne , strawberries dipped in chocolate and a lovely card waiting for us in our room. Location is ideal , 15 minute walk to Harrods and great local shops a couple of minutes away. We used the pool and sauna and both spotlessly clean as was the whole hotel .Have stayed in hotels in Kensington before and would say that The Milestone is the best ."
February 2016,Brilliant!,Partner took me here for my birthday. Great from start to finish staff polite and attentive. complimentary drink on arrival. big soft beds and sky tv in the room.  Really good personal service. would stop at this hotel again in a heartbeat.
April 2016,"Truly, our home in London","My wife and I are fortunate enough to get to London at least a couple of times a year.  We used to stay at a Kensington business hotel that while adequate, was never ""special"" for us. We'd walk by The Milestone on our way to the Kensington High Street tube station, and I'd say to my wife, ""Some day.""  On the next trip, half a dozen years ago,  my wife took me to tea at The Milestone, and that was the deal maker.  Our next visit was our ""some day,"" and from the moment we checked in, bleary-eyed from our overnight flight, to our departure four days later, The Milestone never disappointed.    From the warm greeting by Patricio or Stephen, the doormen who are now like family, to the always helpful and considerate front desk gang, to concierge Andrew's always helpful -- sometimes‚Ä¶"
June 2015,so friendly and helpful,"My wife and i stayed at the Milestone Hotel from the 5th to the 8th April 2016, Loved the hotel and all the staff were really friendly and could not do enough for us to make us feel welcome, we were offered an introductory tour of the hotel.  We stayed in the royal studio and it is the first hotel we have stayed in where the walls were completely covered in a material wall covering, the hotel is right opposite Kensington Palace and Gardens and a 10 minute walk to the nearest tube station."
April 2016,Fantastic Hotel,We stayed last year here and we had so much fun. The receptionists are helpful. They are so very cheerful. We love the breakfast. The room is clean. We would like to thank the housekeepers who cleaned the room daily.
April 2016,As good as ever ,"This is the second time we have stayed at the Milestone, the first in January.  Yet again our stay was perfect with added attention to detail for my partners birthday.  All the staff at this hotel are fantastic making you feel very at home without being over attentive.  We will continue to return and enjoy what feels like our London home. "
April 2016,"Nice, cosy and friendly",I loved my stay at the Milestone Hotel last week and I am coming back next week. The ambience is so nice and relaxing. The rooms are beautiful decorate. The service and the staff is flawless. It is so easy to feel at home here.
April 2016,Impeccable service and unique rooms,"Only one night here for a birthday celebration, but would return without hesitation.  The staff all provide truly excellent service.  You feel that nothing would be too much too ask, yet they are not intrusive in any way.  A birthday card appeared in the room after they heard we were celebrating a birthday, and that was whilst we were enjoying complimentary welcome drinks in the bar."
May 2016,Great Hotel and excellent service,Stayed here for long weekend break and what a great place it is. From the warm welcome and very helpful staff to the homely surroundings and comfortable room this is a great small hotel on the edge of Hyde Park. The food was excellent and the afternoon tea sublime. We look forward to planning a return visit to this gem of a hotel. 
May 2016,Marvellous ,"Stayed here with family before a concert at the RAH.  This is a beautiful hotel with extremely courteous and attentive staff. The rooms were luxurious, superb cuisine and wine list in keeping with a 5*+ hotel and the ambience of the general areas was that of a historic private aristocratic London Town house. This hotel has real character and the staff genuinely want you to feel welcome, nothing is too much trouble, I left my concert tickets in the car after the hotel had parked it for me, only discovering my mistake close to show time, I think that the concierge ran all the way there and back to retrieve them for me.  Can't wait to stay here again and take more time to enjoy the facilities properly. "
April 2016,A perfect weekend,"So I booked through Lovetoescape and wasn't sure how it would be....fantastic! Superb Queen Deluxe room, a welcome glass of champagne in the bar, a bottle of champagne in the room too! Service was fab, exactly what you should expect in a boutique hotel. Close to the Albert Hall, Kings Road, and opposite Kensington Palace and gardens...5 mins to the nearest tube and oh yes, plenty of nearby shopping. Would absolutely stay again....everyone so friendly in the hotel....."
May 2016,Another lovely stay,Really exceeds expectations everytime we stay. Nice and central so location works well for walkers too.  If you are new to London the staff are very helpful with useful information and concierge were fantastic at last minute tickets to Lion king. Thank you!
February 2016,"Fantastic Service, perfect location","What a charming hotel. From the numerous professional staff who seem to enjoy their jobs to the cozy room and luxurious bathroom, we loved our stay.  Each afternoon a fresh snack was delivered to our room.  The staff recommended a fantastic restaurant that was walking distance.  Speaking of walking, what's better than being right across the street from the park? Did I mention how quiet our room was? I look forward to my next visit."
May 2016,Weekend Away,"Had a fantastic time with my hubby, staff very polite and professional.  Whole hotel clean and cant wait to return later in the year. Food excellent and would recommend anyone to go and stay for a weekend"
May 2016,Fabulous stay!,"One night of luxury courtesy of the friendly staff and wonderful venue.   We stayed in the Jungle Room on the 4th floor with a great balcony. We booked through Secret Escapes but I would not have been upset at full price. At the price I paid it was great value!  I'd stay again anytime, thanks. "
May 2016,AMAZING! ,"I couldn't fault this hotel in anyway at all! The place is just breath taking, in all sense. From the minute you walk in the door you are greeted with a smile...   I went to celebrate my birthday and many other occasions along with my husband and the hotel did an amazing job at making it even more special! The room was just beautiful- I have never stayed anywhere that amazed me everytime I walked in the room.. I just couldn't believe how beautiful one place could be!  Thank you to all the staff at the hotel for being so friendly. It makes a place even better.  Jose on the concierge was nothing but helpful and picked a beautiful steakhouse for us to eat at on the Saturday! So thank you.  I can not wait to come back and stay again! It was just the most amazing weekend I have had‚Ä¶"
May 2016,Glorious afternoon tea,"Great traditional and old fashioned small hotel. Very warm welcome by dedicated staff (3 for 18 guests). Good presentation of the product, great selection of teas, champagne, cocktails etc. Fabulous surrounding. Delicious sandwiches, cakes and scones. Very good customer care throughout the experience. Pity for the limited bathroom facilities forcing to queue. Also, loads of service traffic through the main door and lounge."
May 2016,Wow Outstanding !!!!!!,"We had a night away from the children, to celebrate my friends special birthday.  From the moment we got to the hotel, the staff were amazing! We entered the room and my friend had been made a beautiful birthday cake and a personal birthday from Fran the butler.  The service,food and friendly staff was second to none!   We would highly recommend coming to the MIlestone, you will be treated like a VIP.  Thank you everyone for making our evening so very special."
April 2016,Lovely Place !!,"Really lovely place to stay, all staff we encounted were a pure pleasure, they could not do enough for us. The rooms are stunning and everything is in the right place, all the extras are of the best quality, I really wanted to stay longer. We were on a special deal which was fantastic, however the normal rates are probably a little out of our price range, so Thank you the Milestone team. Bryan & Susan Webb"
March 2016,Best Hotel,"Having stayed at many five star hotels in London we can only describe The Milestone as the best for lots of reasons. We have stayed in Red Carnation Hotels before in the UK and abroad and have never been disappointed. The staff and service are second to none, friendly attentive and knowledgeable. The location was excellent and easy to access all parts of central London. We stayed for three nights and were upgraded to an apartment which we greatly appreciated- it was spacious, comfortable and had all the extras that one could wish for with excellent complimentary Wi Fi. We would definitely stay here again"
April 2016,40th Wedding Anniversary,"We were made welcome from the dot go and a tour of facilities(except spa)so cannot comment on that area.We went up a floor via lift to our Room which was well furnished and quaint, comfy bed ''oldie worldy feel''.everything you need in the room. Dinner was good in the authentic restaurant, service excellent The whole Hotel has like a ''Dickens'' feel about it.The Doorman Stephen was very freindly and helpfull as was all the staff really.My wife and I were really pleased we chose the ''Milestone'' for our Celebration and the Suprise of Flowers,Chocolates and Candles etc in our Room when we retired to Bed,Great touch and well done.!

April 2016,Amazing milestone,"We enjoyed 2 wonderful nights at this hotel. We had a super king room, it was cosy and beautifully decorated with rich vibrant colours. It was very clean, house keeping and the reception enquired if all was to standard - which it was. Our room wasn't ready on check-in which was ashame - but we had a brief tour of the hotel and took lunch in the conservatory. We had a 3 course meal included, though the options were limited, we enjoyed our meal both nights. The breakfasts both morning were a real treat and I must say the souffl√© pancakes were incredible. This is an amazing hotel, which is worth every penny.  What really makes the hotel are the staff, who are from every corner of the world, they were so friendly.  This is a hotel which isn't pretencious, where every guest is‚Ä¶"
March 2016,Lovely Hotel,"Such a lovely hotel! The staff are very polite and welcoming, the room we stayed in was gorgeous - and the shower is amazing!!! I struggled to get out :o)   Upon arriving to our room, we were offered a complimentary drink of our choice. Scattered around the room were little gifts, all addressed to me including a welcoming card.   Unfortunately we didn't eat at the hotel so didn't experience the restaurant.   Would definitely stay again and strongly recommend it! Xx "
April 2016,Best Authentic Hotel in London,"Everything about this place was exactly what you would hope.  Doorman excellent, helpful and friendly.  Every person ( at least 6 that I met ) at the front desk was great.  Our waitress for breakfast every day was great.  Both concierges helped make the trip fantastic.  The location is perfect.  Coming back at 10:00 pm after a long day and having tea and the best fresh scones was the best way to end our days.  The rooms are small which is expected but very nice and comfortable and other than a rest or to sleep you shouldn't be in the rooms anyway.  Too much to see and do and explore.  Will definitely stay there again if we go back to London.  Thank you Milestone for a perfect place to stay on vacation with my wife and 3 kids!!"
April 2016,Felt like a guest of the Queen!,"Beautiful facilities, incredible service, and great location directly across from Hyde Park and Kensington Palace!  Our rooms were lovely, comfortable, and so peaceful.  The staff was absolutely the best of any hotel I've ever visited-- the doormen Fran and Steven, Leo at the front desk, Joshua and Tim the concierges-- everyone made us feel incredibly at home and attended to every need.  At one point, we left to walk in the park and Joshua literally ran after us down the street to give us an umbrella.   In addition, Cheneston's restaurant was absolutely fabulous-- the menu, the food, the service, and the setting.  We didn't want to go outside!"
March 2016,The London Hotel of One's Dreams,The hotel seems as if it has been plucked out of a story book.  It is the London that one envisions in one's dreams.  The rooms are intimate and beautifully appointed.  The service is over the top!  A special kudos to Stephen and Andreas for making our stay so special.
January 2016,Classy and inviting,"We had the most amazing time in London for our anniversary.  It was made even better by having a warm and comfortable place to rejuvenate after a long day of sightseeing.  The Milestone Hotel is a quaint facility in Kensington.  It's location is convenient as there were places we wanted to see within walking distance (Notting Hill, Kensington Palace and Gardens) as well as a tube station a short walk away.  The room was extremely comfortable with turn down service every night that included a treat, bottled water and lit candles. We had a beautiful breakfast daily in the downstairs restaurant (continental and English were offered) and nightly cocktails in the lounge area which felt like home. One morning we had to get up early and they provided a wake up call with coffee‚Ä¶"
March 2016,Take me there again,"Excellent service, clean and crisp room, amazing facilities, superior dining experience and very good location. We have enjoyed every part of our stay at the Milestone and couldn't fault a thing ! Cannot but look forward to come back."
April 2016,Amazing service at The Milestone.,"My family and I truly enjoyed our stay at The Milestone Hotel. The service was excellent and some of the best I have experienced anywhere in the world. The employees sincerely seemed to care that their guests were taken care of and happy. As a runner, I loved the location across from Kensington and Hyde Parks. The added perks of wonderful chocolates and treats in the lobby as well as in our room upon arrival and every evening was a wonderful touch."
April 2016,Can't stump these people!,"A great 5 star boutique hotel located opposite Kensington Palace & Gardens and just down the road from the Royal Albert Hall has a staff that cannot do enough for you!!!  We had booked a total of 3 rooms that had different lengths of stay.  The staff handled the room changes and other requests like it was nothing. This is the hotel's strongest asset.  The staff always there to help, but never feel intrusive.  This is a classic British hotel with dark wood paneling and padded walls.  We had king rooms overlooking Kensington gardens and couldn't hear the traffic right outside! If you are looking for traditional with that personal touch, look no further than the Milestone Hotel."
April 2016,My favourite hotel in London - amazing location,"The Milestone is perfect in all but one way, I was staying there on my own...!   The hotel is small and because of this very personal and exclusive, but The staff at Red Carnation manage to make you feel so welcome and at home and its so unstuffy and warm and welcoming   The setting and the hotel building and of course the decor all give you such a strong sense of place, and you will feel like you are in London. the location was perfect and I enjoyed the spring weather and walking in Kensington Park. So close to Royal Albert Hall and the museums as well as shopping on Kensington High Street.    I loved the food, ate the Wagyu beef with black truffle hollandaise and hand cut chips...  I will stay there again, this time with my partner... its my favourite hotel in London"
April 2016,Luxury and amazing customer service,Amazing comfort and luxury in a wonderful setting. Amazing customer service by excellent staff who should be commended for their outstanding hospitality. Our experience and enjoyment seemed to matter and nothing was too much trouble to ensure we have treasured memories of a memorable time at the Milestone. 
March 2016,Absolutely fantastic!,"I've stayed at The Ritz and The Savoy, but none of these compare to The Milestone Hotel in terms of service. We have had an absolutely wonderful stay from start to finish. The staff is friendly and always ready to help. The restaurant and bar employ only top professionals. You really can't go wrong. We even decided to stay an extra night. Although we had to switch rooms because of this the staff took care of everything for us, we only had to switch keycards and make sure everything was properly packed! We WILL be going back! The sooner the better!"
July 2015,Outstanding Hotel,We have just stayed at the Milestone for a second time and we cannot fault it.  Staff are extremely helpful and friendly.  Hotel is spotless and very comfortable.  Rooms are tastefully furnished.  Food superb.  We are both gluten free and they even supplied gluten free cookies in the room - so thoughtful.  Would not hesitate recommending this Hotel - well done the Milestone.
January 2016,Pure Opulence,My husband proposed to me at the Milestone Hotel. It came as a complete surprise. From start to finish the suite he booked and the service we received was excellent. We stayed in an African themed suite. The entire suite had candles and rose petals including in the bath tub. We had champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. Breakfast the next morning was delicious and served to us in our suite. Yes it is expensive and you pay for all these extras but it was worth it for a once in a life time occassion. I definitey recommend the Milestone for a special occassion.
April 2016,best hotel,"This is simply the best hotel in London. I have stayed at many others, including the Connaught, and they do not compare. The service is perfect, the staff friendly and hospitable, and the bar is one of the best. They broght over the staff from the bar at the Halcyon, and it never misses. Walter the bartender is the best! Great small hotel, good breakfast, great box lunch to beat airplane food for the trip home.The personal touches are wonderful, winter includes a hot water bottle in a silk cover and candles in your room at night for turndown, along with a reading light and a nougat. Carolyn King can be proud of her staff, they do a wonderful job. Nice small health club in basement and it is across the street from Kennsington Gardens for runners. There are not many hotels that‚Ä¶"
April 2016,22nd Birthday Treat,"So this is my first review on tripadvisor, and it's safe to say it's worth taking the time out of my working day to do so. I booked a 1 night in a Queen room at the hotel (via booking.com) for my girlfriends 22nd birthday - on the requests I mentioned that it was her birthday and any extra would be appreciated. We got to the hotel around midday and although the room wasn't ready, which it wasn't expected to be, the hotel took our bags off us at the door and offered complimentary champagne and upgrade to a king room! What a way to welcome the guests! My girlfriend had brought a bottle of bubbly to celebrate which we opened in the evening before going out. I left the bottle in cold water in the sink (as you do) and upon return the bottle was in an ice bucket, candles and rose‚Ä¶"
April 2016,Friendly Character,"This lovely hotel just screams character from every corner. The buildings have an intriguing and interesting history including many characters that have lived and worked there throughout the centuries. The staff throughout the hotel were simply wonderful. Help and advice was always at hand during our stay in an extremely friendly and expert way.  Breakfast was simply outstanding. Choice, quality, variety, served in a room that felt, in a good way, as if we had been transported back in time. Situated close to The Royal Albert Hall, close to Bus and Tube connections and just across the road from Kensington Palace and Gardens, an ideal location. Do not miss this place, fantastic."
March 2016,Afternoon tea fit for a princess,"I booked afternoon tea for my 5 year old daughter and me. We chose the Milestone Hotel as they do a special children's afternoon tea and I wanted the experience to be a good one for her. My daughter is quite grown-up for her age and behaves very well, but I was concerned that she might not be made to feel welcome. I needn't have worried. From the delightful doorman to the lovely waiting staff, the pastry chef and the concierge, everyone made us feel extremely welcome and my daughter was truly treated like a princess.   The decor in the Park  Lounge is quite formal and very intimate, so I would not recommend it for children who are younger or have trouble sitting still for long periods of time, but we loved it. It was calm and peaceful with a great view of the park. I had the‚Ä¶"
March 2016,Excellent,"Location - Kensington a few minutes walk to the high street, tubes, bus stops and a stones through from Kensington Palace. Check in - Superb, room wasn't ready we were very early offered a complimentary drink in the bar. Room - Amazing, everything you could want for, luxury towels, luxury bed linen, complimentary home made biscuits in room .tv, ipod docking station. complimentary water.And spotless Breakfast - Best pancakes I have ever tasted. service superb , small but lovely restaurant. Check out- Bill correct, reception kept our cases for the day until we were ready to leave for the station. From the minute you arrive to the minute you leave you are treated very well and even addressed by your names . Doorman superb and very efficient.  We have stayed in Hotel 41 and Montugue‚Ä¶"
February 2016,Great place for a glass of Champagne!,"Our first visit here will be the first of many! Excellent service from all staff in hotel and  Stables Bar. Relaxed, tasteful and comfortable surroundings. specially good for couples and small groups. Bar staff make fantastic Cocktails! Intimate, friendly and large helping of quality, well done The Milestone!"
March 2016,I loved to stay here,There is so much to tell about the hotel. Check in by friendly staff was pleasurable. The room was spotlessly neat. They offered complementary beverages with the wake-up call. There is a lot to choose about the room to make you comfortable like pillow menu. I simply loved to stay here. 
March 2016,The Royal Treatment,"Such a charming and unique hotel it‚Äôs rather hard to describe but here‚Äôs a go.  D√©cor Very English ‚Äìtraditional and impeccable.  Our room was cosy, well equipped and spotless.  Many of the furnishing are proper antiques. SO many little sweet touches, like cookies in the room and candles lit in the bathtub when they turn down.  It‚Äôs a home more than a room.  Staff EVERYONE treats you like an old friend, from the moment you arrive till when you leave and they come to say farewell.  You feel like royalty!  Value For the location and level, the prices are excellent, many meals and around ¬£100 for TWO!  Location Can it get better?  Views of the park and moments from all that London has to offer  Cheneston's Restaurant Sunday Afternoon Lunch - Excellent traditional meal served in a‚Ä¶"
March 2016,Best stay every!,"I loved this hotel. I would come back over and over again. There are not enough words to describe everything: starting by the check in and the tour of the hotel done by Frans, following by the abundant details in the room ( a flower, some Easter chocolates, and even some prunes by the bedside1 ) following with the wake up call with complimentary delivery of your choice of beverage to your room  ( what a way to wake up! )  . The bar has a english sense and  delicious drinks prepared by Plinio and Marcos. The afternoon tea with piano music on the background amazing, Jose the concierge helped us in every need we had. For breakfast I had the most fluffy pancakes ever done and the eggs benedict looked amazing. Dinner was great served by Francisco ( I think ) in a beautiful cozy‚Ä¶"
March 2016,One of the best hotels in London!,"We stayed here for one night recently and it was fabulous.  I have stayed at many top London hotels, including the Ritz, Claridges and the Savoy and this one is undoubtedly in the same category.  We were lucky enough to be in the Kensington Gardens Suite which was beautiful, on two levels, spotlessly clean and with every amenity you can think of.  It is the little touches which make this hotel so special - homemade cookies in your room etc and on turndown we even got a little book and a booklight each - amazing.  But it is really the staff here that make this hotel.  Every single member of staff that I encountered without exception was friendly, professional without any elements of snobbery that you can encounter in 5* hotels.  All genuinely friendly and wanting to make our stay‚Ä¶"
March 2016,Fantastic Service,"One of the finest experiences I've had in a hotel. From the moment the staff greeted us we were well taken care of. For our first night in London we wanted to go out to a local pub but found the hotel bar, The Stables, so charming we decided to stay in.  The reason for 4 stars in place of 5, is that our room needed some minor cosmetic repairs. "
March 2016,Love this hotel,"We stayed here for 3 days as part of our honeymoon. Our room was AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL! We stayed at the Margaret Rose Suite. We were welcomed by the most romantic decorations! Chocolates everywhere, lit candles that smelled so good! The staff were also amazing and helpful! They even gave us free champagne! Just awesome! The hotel looks super nice too. Can't complain. Although there was some creaking that scared me, the rest of our stay was just perfect! "
March 2016,Andrew ILLINGWORTH ,We found the whole experience to be one of fantastic standard in every way - my wife and I really enjoyed our stay the staff could not have been more helpful - the location is superb - we enjoyed our visit to Kensington gardens  The full English breakfast was s great start to our day - teddy the door man made our stay 
March 2016,5* Stay,"Our stay at the Milestone hotel was fantastic. Our room was spotless and extremely comfortable with a king size bed and had everything you needed for the perfect stay. We had lunch in the hotel before heading out and the food was superb. We decided to have our breakfast in our room, and again the breakfast was superb. The hotels attention to detail is top notch. We will definitely be returning."
March 2016,Thoroughly enjoyed my stay,"Stayed in Apartment # 5 (two bedrooms, two baths, kitchen, living area, fireplace). They stocked the fridge with juice, bread, jam, bottled water.    We enjoyed our dinner at Chenestons (Milestone restaurant) and the Stables Bar is the best.  The staff are very high service.  Thanks to Fran, Leo, Liam, Fabrizio, Graham and many others for making our stay so comfortable."
March 2016,wonderful stay ruined by horrid experience,"When we arrived at the hotel our room was not ready, so we had to wait in the bar whilst it was cleaned and prepared. It was a minor inconvenience and we didn't mind at the time.although the hotel seemed perfect in every way whilst we stayed, it was not long after we left before we had the first telephone call leaving a message to say we needed to phone the hotel urgently. On doing so the member of staff said he was embarrassed to ask but did we find a Pandora bracelet in our room as a previous guest had left one , when I said of course not as we would have handed it it straight away he asked perhaps on the coffee table? I said definitely not and he apologized for asking.  I was a little upset that what had seemed ike a perfect stay was now marred by the thought that we might‚Ä¶"
March 2016,great hotel,"stayed here on buisness, great staff, great food, very clean.. will come back. the beds are real comfortable and free wi fi, was very quiet to no disturbance from other rooms and tehre are lots of places nearby."
March 2016,Wonderful one night stay,"My brief stay was delightful, a gorgeous room stocked with everything you could possibly need, attentive and charming staff, a delicious breakfast.  The Milestone is an oasis of calm and tranquillity in the heart of London.  Highly recommended!"
March 2016,Wonderful.  ,"Another wonderful time at the Milestone. A belated birthday treat for me from my Mum. We were joined by my youngest daughter and fiance. Both rooms were gorgeous. I had a welcome back card waiting for me, a lovely touch. The extra little treats, teabags (my favourite)  home-made biscuits and sweets make you feel special. On our return from the Royal Albert Hall there was a birthday card and yummy strawberries dipped in chocolate waiting for me.  My daughter felt guilty as she had left her room in a mess before we went out for the evening and on our return everything had been tidied.  The awesome staff are what really make your stay special,  always friendly, helpful and attentive.  I am looking forward to returning again in May. "
March 2016,An excellent mini-break,"We have just had a very enjoyable 2 night stay at The Milestone.  All was superb - from the deluxe double room, the home made cookies waiting for us, and the amazing French toast served for breakfast.  We dined in on one evening and were treated to a lovely meal.  Also a perfect location, close to the underground and a stones throw from Kensington Gardens - perfect for a leisurely stroll.  What stands out most though is the staff - so attentive and engaging, nothing was too much trouble - a breath of fresh air!  I am sure we will return.  Cathy R."
March 2016,"A Lovely Hotel, with very professional and attentive staff!!","Mr Andrew Pike the general manager has a good marketable product on offer with this hotel, backed up by a very well groomed and professional team of people! We stayed here at the Milestone over the weekend March 19th, we had booked our stay thro ugh secret escapes and when it came to check in we were luckily enough to have received a room upgrade to the royal suite, which was room 209 on the second floor, the room was traditionally  furnished with all the five star extra's that you would expect!! Including a comprehensive and well stocked mini bar, two sets of robes, one for the bathroom and another for general wear when in the room, complementary water, biscuits (home made by the chef!) and we also received a welcome and complementary bottle of Champagne, in fact this was a‚Ä¶"
February 2016,Very special birthday treat,"We cannot recommend this hotel enough for when you are looking for luxury, great service and amazing location. Fantastic attention to detail. Our car was whisked away on arrival to be parked without fuss. The champagne afternoon tea was an experience in itself, a real joy. Then we found we had been upgraded to a suite as our visit was celebrating a special birthday. Wow- utter luxury. When it was time to head off to the theatre for Mamma Mia, a taxi was hailed for us by the extremely helpful concierge team in seconds. We returned to a beautifully prepared room and hot chocolate. We slept very well in our four poster. A sumptuous breakfast was served in the morning with everything we wanted. I can highly recommend the eggs benedict. A magnificent hotel, the staff are all very‚Ä¶"
March 2016,Service - at its best,"Stayed here in Feb 2016 as a party of 4. We were going to the Royal Albert Hall to see Cirque De Soleil, and the location is spot on for that venue.  I cannot rate the level of service highly enough. Doorman greeted us like old friends, and arranged valet parking for our car, ideal in London.  Reception booking in was swift and welcoming. We were shown to our rooms and offered a tour of the hotel. Welcome card and gifts in our rooms. Our guests had the African room, and we were opposite in a lovely room too. Welcome drink served in you room or in the lounge as you preferred.  Breakfast was excellent. All in all, perfect hotel and location for a London break."
March 2016,A wonderful stay,"We are a middle aged couple visiting London for leisure. This hotel is perfectly situated for visiting the Royal Albert hall and museums.This was our first stay at the milestone but it certainly won't be our last. From the moment we arrived the staff were professional, attentive and sincere without being overpowering. The hotel felt warm and friendly, this is not a modern hotel, the decor is very traditional, lots of wooden paneling, mosaic floors, polished brass all to a very high standard. We had a superior room, enhanced by the attention to detail, fresh flowers, a small box of biscuits handmade by the chef, a handwritten note from the general manager to welcome us and at ""turn down "" time a candle by the bath and a card on the bedside giving the weather forecast for the‚Ä¶"
November 2015,Perfect!,"Arrived to be greeted at the Taxi, bags taken into the hotel and shown to the front desk. All staff were lovely, once checked in we were given a tour of the hotel. Then shown to our rooms. Both rooms were very different, both absolutely gorgeous. There were little perks that made the stay even better, nice toiletries, biscuits etc. Food was lovely, had breakfast and Lunch and both meals were so tasty! we all wishes we had stayed another night! Will definitely be going again. The hotel has dome very interesting history behind it to, which is detailed in each room."
February 2016,Elegance at its' best!,Attention to detail is the hallmark of any luxury hotel. The Milestone from the incredibly unique architecture to the tea service elegance is personified. The staff is beyond courteous and the best of the best professionally. The Milestone is not a place to stay for the faint of heart as it completely captures the soul from the excellence of the cuisine to the intimacy of the bar. Across from Kensington Palace who could ask for more !
March 2016,A lovely stay at the Milestone,We stayed at the milestone last Sunday and was greeted by the manager who showed us round and gave us a beautiful room (all the rooms at the Milestone are lovely)  We had a delicious dinner in the restaurant and a lovely breakfast the next morning  We cant wait to return it is a very special place
February 2016,Drinks only - we did not stay,We popped in for a drink whilst passing as it looked so warm and welcoming. The gentleman on the door was very friendly and welcoming as were the waiting staff and the piano man was excellent. We were given free canap√©s with our drinks and spent a lovely couple of hours in there. Would thoroughly recommend!
January 2016,Fantastic! A very special experience.,"From the moment we arrived when the gentleman picked our bags out of the taxi, and welcomed us, the whole experience was very very special. Never have we had such special treatment from a hotel, from the reception staff, the concierge, who gave us a tour of the hotel before taking us up to our room, and personally explaining the facilities there, the exceptional bar and restaurant staff, to the excellent food and atmosphere. It is a real haven in London, feels more like a country house hotel, and a lovely relaxing place to spend time in. The staff genuinely feel more like friends! Thank you, we'll definitely be back as soon as possible!"
March 2016,Consistently amazing!,"This is the third time I have stayed at this hotel. We continue to be amazed by the service, the atmosphere and the attention to detail by the folks at the Milestone.   I'll keep this review simple, but if you are looking for a charming hotel, and you're not so focused on mega-hotel amenities, then you should consider the Milestone. Many of us have high stress/energy lives. The charm and the ambiance of this hotel has an ability to instantly take you out of that world and provide an experience that is just so refreshing.   The hotel is also very well located, about a 5 minute walk from a tub station. There is local shopping, pubs, restaurants, etc etc.   I've stayed at the Milestone three times over three years. Most of the same people are still working there. That tell me they‚Ä¶"
March 2016,A gem!,"I can wholeheartedly recommend this hotel.   I think the most important feature of a really great hotel is its staff and Milestone did not let us down in this respect. All staff we met during our 3 night stay were very friendly, fast and professional but also informal in a pleasant way. It also seemed they enjoyed their work and had a good time together.  The hotel is beautifully decorated in a very traditional British way, full of nice details in rooms, restaurant and public areas.  Some examples of great service: morning gowns were available in the room in the right size for my kids, clearly prepared based on given check in information. Teddy bears and puzzle books as gifts along with a box of cookies. An EU electric adapter ready in the room and when we asked for an extra it‚Ä¶"
December 2015,"Great, great hotel","If you are looking for  a 5-star hotel w old world charm and outstanding staff and service, this is where you should stay. The hotel is located directly across from Kensington Park, has access to both Notting Hill, Kensington and South Kensington restaurants and is close to several convenient tube stops."
February 2016,Superb.,"We stayed here in the New Year. One of the nicest hotels in the area. It Even accepts pets. We bought our new German Shepherd puppy to stay with us and everything was first class for him including a dog menu , feeding/water bowl, toys and even his own bed. fantastic.  The facilities for us were  just as good, including my own birthday cake,champagne, treats, balcony, lovely comfy bed and anything else we could possibly need.  The staff here are exceptional, they really do go out of there way to help you. I did have one problem with the breakfast one morning. They were full so we sat in the front area and ordered breakfast and proceeded to wait, and wait. I think the waitress forgot we were there because I'm sure in the best of worlds it does not take 40 minutes to make an‚Ä¶"
January 2016,Outstanding!,"A first class experience with incredible staff on hand to service your every need. Wonderfully attentive, friendly and helpful. The hotel is small and perfectly formed. Food was exceptional value for money too. All in all a wonderful stay. We will certainly be back!"
February 2016,Quick layover in London...perfect service and all the comforts,"My daughter and I had a 12 hour overnight layover in London.  Instead of staying in one of the ""airport ""hotels he took the quick cab ride into town to stay at the Milestone.  They went a above and beyond to make sure we sere satisfied with everything. We ordered a late dinner and they brought the our ice cream later so it wouldn't melt while we enjoyed a delicious dinner first."
February 2016,Overnight stay at The Milestone Hotel - Wonderful,"My wife and I stayed at The Milestone Hotel on Saturday Feb 9th. It was booked as a celebration that also coincided with a Billy Connolly concert in London.  From the second we walked up the small number of steps to the hotel we were treated wonderfully well. The checking in process was done with a smile and a genuine interest in our trip. We were then offered a tour of the hotel. This covered its history, a viewing of the exquisite 'tea room' and an overview of the services available to us.  We like to walk and ventured around Hyde Park and the surrounding area. When we returned a selection of home baked biscuits and a lovely letter from the hotel was waiting for us.  In the evening we left for our concert. A great time was had (it was Billy Connolly after all!) and returned to‚Ä¶"
January 2016,Refined Elegant ,Wow! This was our final splurge in London after touring the UK and France for some six weeks. I could not think of a better way to finish our trip. From the moment you step on to the front steps you are made to feel special and welcomed. Not pretentious just a warm welcome from everyone that you encounter! The gentleman that showed us to our suite was magnificent! Our dining experience was beyond excellent. Truly a refined elegant decadent hotel! Can't wait for our return trip when we most certainly will be back. I would rate 5 star plus plus if it were available!
February 2016,Very nice hotel,"Spend 3 nights in end of January but just now have time to write the review. Hotel have great location , nice design . The room was clean, luxury. The food was good with good service. The staff is helpful with nice smile. We had a nice holiday, would like to come back again"
November 2015,Outstanding ,"Exceptionally friendly and helpful, smiling staff, who couldn't have made us feel more welcome. Fantastic food. Beautiful hotel. The complimentary champagne and other treats were a nice touch. Just loved it. So hope we can return. Thank you all at the milestone X"
September 2015,Nice stay,Our overall stay was nice.... Luxurious and lavish ...Good service and good food. The staff is very professional and have a good attitude towards guests. No bad experience at all... Great place for a getaway...
January 2016,Perfect Escape,"The Milestone Hotel is extremely comfortable and luxurious but not at all intimidating. We thoroughly enjoyed our several nights here and never once heard another guest.  The staff were professional and unobtrusive with no silly attitude. Our room was amazingly clean, beautiful, and chocked full of amenities.  We experienced highly polished staff behaviours in actions and deeds, all evidence of significant training investment.  We chose our visit based on TripAdvisor reviews our experience was born out as suggested by others. Well Done."
January 2016,A fantastic afternoon tea,"We took afternoon tea on Sunday 31st January 2015 it was absolutely wonderful, stunning hotel excellent staff and the food was to die for. My advice dont eat the day before and be thankful Hyde Park is across the road as you will be grateful for the walk.   We will be back!"
November 2015,Hope to return!,"This was an anniversary weekend and the excellent reviews were not exaggerated. We also had their afternoon tea and the GF version was amazing. The mattress was very comfortable (I'm picky), the service was excellent. Good location. We didn't have a park view but for me, this was a plus as our courtyard room was very quiet. Yes this is a pretty expensive hotel per night, but definitely worth it. Do not hesitate to book if you don't mind spending a bit."
September 2015,Return Visit,"After considering other options in London we decided to return to the Milestone Hotel for a second visit in November. Needless to say, our stay in the hotel this time was as faultless as the first visit.   As before the service was outstanding with the staff making an effort to engage guests in conversation and understand their needs. As rooms are in various shapes, sizes, and with different decor we were asked if we were happy with the room we had when we first saw it.   The room itself was very nicely decorated. We had elected to go for a room that had a small downstairs lounging area but in retrospect we should have taken a room with a single floor that had more space around the bed where we spent most of our in-room time anyway.   If one is looking for charging, warm place‚Ä¶"
May 2015,The best hotel experience we've ever had! (and I don't say that lightly!),"This is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed out.  It's not just the room, it's the service, it's how the staff engage and operate, it's the little 'extras' along the way (think complimentary evening turn-down service, and mini scones delivered to your room and oh-so-much more).  They are catering to your experience and go out of their way to make sure you are looked after.  It's a high class hotel in every sense - beautifully detailed inside and out.  Even though our room wasn't large it had every convenience we needed, including international travel adapters, complimentary bottled water, and even high speed wifi internet.  The restaurant was exceptional.  We only had breakfast at the hotel (too busy sight seeing) but the food was cooked to perfection.  There were many‚Ä¶"
October 2015,Lovely place,we have a nice experience in this hotel last summer its a very cousy place easy to find it and the reception is fantastic the view pint is very accessible and practical for guest is a really lovely place
November 2015,Great experience!,"We had a great time at the Milestone Hotel and stayed 10 days total. The room was immaculate and attention to every detail was made. The turn down service with floating candle in the bath was just an added bonus in the evening after long days of sightseeing. Every morning we had delicious meals in the restaurant. We fell in love with Devon who waited on us each morning with a big smile and great suggestions on typical English dishes.   Andrea the Concierge gave us great suggestions on getting around town and on how to navigate the various venues. He arranged a play that was fabulous. Every restaurant he suggested was delicious.    Steven greeted us every morning with a smile,  held the door and sent us on our way. When we needed a umbrella he made sure we had it and all this‚Ä¶"
November 2015,Old world luxury & hospitality,"We luxuriated for 7 days in this unique, beautiful hotel overlooking Kensington Gardens. The staff are all exceptional, from the concierges to the skilled bartenders, the waiters to the doormen, and every friendly member of staff in between. Our spacious junior suite (Viscount) had green views and a jewel box interior. It was generously serviced twice a day with care and special luxury touches. The cream tea, cocktails, full English breakfast, dinner (room service and restaurant) were delicious. The experience was personal, care-full, and generous. It is old world, a little eccentric, warm and romantic. You really feel like a welcome guest here, from arrival to departure. An oasis in London. "
October 2015,Nice hotel,"Had a very nice stay lovely room very clean great staff nothing too much trouble. Breakfast slightly disappointing, (had in room) porridge was thick and stodgy inedible, bacon over cooked toast very hard. Overall a nice stay."
October 2015,Superb hotel - and excellent location,"We stayed at the Milestone for our Wedding Anniversary. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, and as we were running late they helped us up to our room quickly, plus provided 2 glasses of complimentary champagne in the room very quickly also.  The room was to a very high standard indeed, and the bed was amazingly comfortable. The breakfast was absolutely delicious - both the cooked options and the buffet selection were superb.  Best part about this hotel is that it is right on the corner of Kensington Gardens, so perfect for an early morning jog around Hyde Park - one of the best things to do on a Sunday morning.  We've stayed before together with 2 children, and a room overlooking the park - and the experience was superb then also."
October 2015,Beautiful Hotel & Exceptional Customer Service,"This is a beautiful hotel in a great location on Kensington Gardens near the High Street tube station.  But, what makes this hotel beyond fantastic is the customer service.  The employees of The Milestone go out of their way to make you feel welcome and right at home.  Jose and Andrea at the concierge were incredibly helpful from giving us suggestions in the city to arranging exclusive dinner reservations prior to our arrival.  The staff is extremely friendly, and you can tell they take great pride in making your stay as enjoyable as possible.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Milestone and would definitely return."
September 2015,Apartments are phenomenal but the service is what makes this home!,"We booked here after a bad experience at St. Ermins caused us to flee to somewhere new so I did nothing more than a quick tripadvisor search.   What a gem!!! The service blows the doors off the Ritz, which says a lot. Every single staff member goes above and beyond. It's rather like staying with family or at an exceptional B&B. Upon checkin they upgraded is to an apartment, which I could easily spend a week in. Pedro is fantastic! from the front doormen to housekeeping, it's beyond top notch. Huge accommodations for the city, and every detail provided for. Gift pack for the kids, changed a lightbulb on the desk that Pedro noticed while showing us in. Even down to milk in the fridge for my son (I think they added it after hearing why we left St. Ermins. I was yelled at when I‚Ä¶"
October 2015,Simply perfect!,"I've stayed at a number of luxury hotels in Europe....Ritz in London and Paris, Villa d'Este. to name a few. I don't think I have ever been more comfortable and felt such a sincere welcome as I did recently at the Milestone Hotel in London. English charm at its finest, with no detail overlooked. Dining was superb, and the breakfast exceeded my expectations for such a relatively small, quaint hotel. The staff's personal attention had me in constant awe. Shear subtle elegance without the pompous formalities found in the larger 5 star hotels. I knew after the first night that I would never stay anywhere else in London anytime in the future. Reasonable rates with a 3rd night free through American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts. Simply perfect!"
September 2015,A Home in London,"Another wonderful homely experience at this gem of a hotel. We travelled with two friends to visit the Albert Hall (7 mins walk) for a show. It was our friends first visit to Milestone and they loved it just as much as we do. The overriding feeling you get is friendly charming staff who will offer to gladly help in any way they can. The training behind this brand must be first class and the staff selection is clearly picking the winners as personality shines through. If you have the chance enjoy a long relaxing afternoon tea in the lounge with a glass (proper measure) of Mo√´t Chandon which appears to be the house wine! Breakfast was lovely, we enjoyed the complimentary coffee and tea that I'd delivered to guest as they chose...... No silly room kettles in this hotel! We love the‚Ä¶"
October 2015,Lovely stay!,"We visited for 5 nights and had a truly lovely experience.  From reception to dining to concierge: the staff is wonderful!  We felt relaxed and ""at home"" immediately. Dinner was fabulous at the restaurant and again, the service was impeccable. Loved coming back in the evening and sit by the piano.The location is also perfect."
October 2015,Phenomenal experience,"From the moment we entered the lobby until the moment we checked out, we felt immediately at ease and home away from home.  The attention to service is without fault.  We were traveling with our two teenage daughters, so we booked two separate rooms.  Both rooms were well appointed, bright, roomy & comfortable.  There is a nightly turn-down and tidy service provided at no additional charge.   The rooms have heavy drapes which can be pulled across the windows, eliminating street noise & offending light.  My favorite perk was the professional blowdryer, not one of those horrid things screwed into the bathroom wall...no, this is the real-deal, low noise ionic high velocity hairdryer.  I'm telling you ladies, I was temped to place it in my luggage, it was that nice.  If you have‚Ä¶"
October 2015,Superb Stay!,"Stayed here one night attending a concert at the Royal Albert Hall, a short walk from the hotel.  This delightful hotel is the epitome of a very upmarket traditional English Town House. Friendly, welcoming staff, very comfortable bed room, with large bathroom - 2 basins and a large bath, with luxury bath products.  The one slight disappointment was the lack of tea/coffee making facilities in the room.  Breakfast - what can be said?  The attention to detail was outstanding, down to the individual crudites, and the best cooked English breakfast ever.  Amazing!"
October 2015,RWC 2015,"My third visit and as always brilliant! The room, the service, the restaurant and the bar, superb and without fault. Such a pleasure to be in a great location with everything you could ask for and much more. We will be back and can't wait, such an inviting yet luxurious hideaway in the heart of Kensington."
October 2015,A Gem by the Park,"I never heard of the hotel before this. My travel agent mentioned it to me and I was slightly skeptical. I will never question my travel agent again. It is one of a kind. I felt that I was living in an English Manor. The service was impeccable along with rooms that are so well done.  Forget all the big expensive hotel when you go to London. I felt like I was staying with some friends in London and not in a hotel. The location is great. You are right across the street from Kensington Gardens and close by to Notting Hill,Chelsea and Knightsbridge. They have a very charming bar in the lobby and a great place for a spot of tea.  This is one of the greatest finds of the year."
October 2015,Absolutely wonderful!,"Spent 9 days surrounded by the best service in London, luxurious accommodations and the finest staff of professionals you'll find anywhere. No request too big, no detail too small is a motto they live by 24/7.  They were all one step ahead in anticipating any need.  We'll be back!  "
October 2015,The Milestone-a most welcoming experience.,"This hotel is as close as I have come to a true British experience.  The ambience is definitely old world charm.  The service is beyond welcoming and attentive.  The bed linens pressed and crisp cotton, the mattress and pillows-perfect for the good night sleep that one needs to be up and about to take in all the sights that only London can provide."
August 2015,The staff is the best!!,"This hotel is on the Amex Fine Hotels program and is also rated highly on Trip Advisor.  Both are well deserved as this hotel exudes class from the moment you arrive, and it doesn't let up through the entire stay.  Chloe, Fran, Pedro, Devon, etc. all are great representatives and made us feel welcome and had fun with us at the same time.  The food there is excellent too. Their chicken pot pie is a must, as well as their wagu burger and the breakfast waffles. The beds are comfortable and room amenities are nice.  One thing to be aware of is, as a tall person, the ceiling in the shower does not leave much room because the tub is a step up.  I made it work, but someone taller than 6'3"" is going to have a tough time standing up without hitting the ceiling.  I would stay here again‚Ä¶"
September 2015,A Wonderful Hotel in the heart of Kensington,"The Milestone hotel was truly the best hotel experience of my life. I was taking some special friends of mine for a weekend to London to watch the final Ashes Cricket Test match and while we enjoyed the spectacle ( despite and England defeat ), the icing on the cake was the hotel, its staff and wonderful ambience.  I cannot rate highly enough the people who looked after us during the weekend. From reception, to concierge, to restaurant and bar staff, everyone treated us like we were royalty. Next time, I will have the afternoon tea, the ambience of the drawing room is to die for !"
November 2015,Charming boutique hotel,This lovely boutique hotel across from Kensington Gardens does everything to make you feel welcomed. The employees are their #1 asset and we recommend this lovely hotel without reservation or hesitation.  The concierges are so helpful and accommodating. Well done Milestone!
October 2015,Third time staying here and it just keeps getting better,"We've chosen the Milestone for a two night stay in London three years running now and I'm still struggling to find the right words to describe how good it is. I can't find a single thing about the place that isn't absolute perfection - it's the best hotel experience imaginable. I've stayed in other luxury hotels around London - including the Savoy among others, but they can't come close to the experience of the Milestone. The obsessive attention to detail with everything and the unbelievable level of service. Every member of staff will bend over backwards to make you feel welcome and to help out with anything. For me, it's their level of service that sets the Milestone above all the others - I've not experienced such high quality customer service anywhere else, from any other‚Ä¶"
November 2015,Amazing Experience,"Not very often does a hotel experience far, far exceed expectations, but the Milestone is one lovely hotel which does.  It is a lovely grand lady with wonderful amenities.  Very unique and special; a total home-like feeling.  Each area of the down stairs is special and different.  The breakfast are is charming and the food fabulous.  The tea was lovely; the best I have had in London and that includes The Ritz.  Took my daughter there for her first tea experience and she was so excited and felt to special..Service was terrific and everything about the Milestone is grand scale on an intimate level.  Not to be missed!!!"
September 2015,Another fabulous time. ,"I stayed at the Milestone again this weekend. I was with my Mum, brother and sister-in-law. We were upgraded to an apartment. What a great start to the weekend ! We arrived early (09.30) and so was pleasantly  surprised to find the apartment ready for us. The flowers we ordered for my Mum (birthday treat) were already waiting for her.  Everyone is always so cheerful, polite and nothing is too much trouble.  Another 2 members of the family popped in for breakfast on Sunday and we all enjoyed wide variety of hot and cold food.  We have already booked another visit for March 2016.  Lovely people and a lovely hotel. üòÉ  "
November 2015,Fantastic ,It was an absolute pleasure to stay at this hotel. Luxurious rooms with everything you could possibly want or need is at hand or a phone call away. Beautifully soft beds and lovely linen which was fresh and clean. The whole room was spotless. Delightful staff who will go out of their way to accomodate you. Will definitely return. 
November 2015,Fabulous Hotel !,"We recently had the pleasure to stay at this gem of a hotel and thoroughly enjoyed our stay on our first trip to London.  First off, I have never experienced such an attentive staff before in a hotel as I did at the Milestone.  From check-in, to the bartender and restaurant staff, the concierge, housekeeping‚Ä¶everyone was so pleasant and eager to make our stay a pleasant one.  The quality and design of the hotel common areas and our room were a delight, with small added touches that I have not experienced at other luxury hotels that I have stayed at.  The staff made room for us at their afternoon tea one afternoon on short notice, and it was both charming and delicious, and something you should definitely consider if you staying at this hotel.  It was just a wonderful hotel‚Ä¶"
September 2015,Best Hotel with 5 star true British touch,"Excellent location , superb room service and great cozy traditional British rooms with finest room amenities. Rooms are very clean with  nice furnishings . Value for money and great feeling when you stay here. Break fast is good too expensive . High tea you need to book in advance , presentation at high tea is superb . TOO expensive. But good experience to have one while you are at this property. All staff are very professionally trained and very good knowledge of the London and surroundings . Check in front desk staff are dressed nicely but not that friendly when you check in you see they still lack to offer  the 5 star reception to the guests compare to other 5 star facilities . If you are booking this hotel pl have them included your breakfast . Not too many variety for‚Ä¶"
November 2015,Stayed for second time in September coming back this week  !,"My husband stayed for second time in September on a trip to visit Universities with my son. He stayed in the Safari Suite, (last time stayed in the apartments) , breakfast was excellent as before..and room was lovely ,. As he is going back this week will be interesting to see if everything remains excellent . I note that some reviewers have mentioned being upgraded on arrival , this has never happened to us even though we are returning customers which is a bit disappointing, will update this review after his stay, will be a great test of consistency! I expect they will continue to impress!!"
November 2015,Amazing experience,"My partner and I recently got engaged and booked a stay with this hotel to celebrate. The hotel staff were amazing and so helpful! In the evening we came back and our room (which was already beautiful) had been decorated in rose petals, candles, chocolates and strawberries. It was a lovely surprise and really made the trip special. Generally, the hotel is gorgeous. There is a resistance pool and sauna in the basement which, whilst small, was not very busy so it was nice to have it to ourselves. Oh, the complimentary hot chocolate is also a very yummy perk! We also ordered off the 24 hour room service and the food was still lovely. Generally, we are very grateful to the hotel for such a lovely stay."
November 2015,Wow!! Simply wonderful,"This Hotel is wonderful. The service, the rooms and all the special touches make this a wonderful hotel for anyone. We arrived with our nine years old son who absolutely loved it. The staff were so friendly, especially Georgia, they went out of their way to ensure that every request was catered for. The concierge took time to explain and book the attractions for us, we really didn't have to do anything ourselves. The hotel itself is fit for a King, just beautiful and the rooms are gorgeous. The breakfast was delicious and the afternoon tea, probably the best in London. Thanks you to all the staff who made this visit to London exceptional. We will definitely be back after Christmas, Thanks You."
July 2015,"Superb lunch, extraordinary service",Went to the Milestone for a celebratory lunch and was very impressed. Decor is excellent albeit that the first floor resembles a rabbit warren but the small dining room we used was warm and comfortable - perfect for our group.   I am always wary of mass catering but the food was first class and well presented.   Most impressive though was the service. There appeared to be more staff than guests all of whom were only too anxious to meet every need. All of them knew how to strike the perfect balance of friendliness and a pleasant chat if appropriate versus decorum and politeness.   I didn't stay at the hotel but on the impressions from lunch have no reason to doubt that this would be a luxurious experience. 
July 2015,Epitome of Elegance,"From the moment you enter you know you are in a very special place. All service is extremely polished and warm. They have a very international staff. You really do feel like you're in someone's elegant townhouse---which this once was. Two townhouses actually. We must thank our travel expert who is affiliated with Virtuoso because we received additional amenities, a very nice room upgrade and chauffeur service to our final destination in London. This hotel and it's staff provided a serene retreat from the noisy crowded bustle of London. Would highly recommend it without exception."
June 2015,"Gentlemen's afternoon tea at The Milestone Hotel, London","A family tradition and indulgence is afternoon tea at four or five star hotels. My wife and I, with various family members, have had very good experiences around the world. However, the Gentlemen's afternoon tea at The Milestone Hotel in London was the best I have had in a long time. The room where afternoon tea was served was attractive and comfortable, the food was more than sufficient in quantity, was wide in variety, and was very good in quality, the tea remained at the right temperature, and the service was excellent. All in all it was a superb experience. Thank you to David who served us, and to my daughter Rhiannon for taking me and her mother."
July 2015,3 Wonderful Days at The Milestone Hotel,"Everything was GREAT from Check In through Check Out. Everyone was extremely friendly, courteous and went above and beyond on attention to detail. After a quick and very personal check in we were led to our lovely room, the lady that scorted us went into full detail explaining all the room amenities. Everyday we had some sort of delicacy from the hotel chef to enjoy at evenings. Every morning our breakfast was beyond formidable, both a la carte, or buffet, waiters at the restaurant were always marvelous and extremely attentive. Hotel surroundings are beautiful, across the street from Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. I can't really find or say anything below wonderful! We wish could spent some more time in this wonderful city and this wonderful hotel."
July 2015,"Gerald Negvesky, MD","The Milestone is an absolute London Gem!  A close sophisticated friend who frequents London from the U.S. recommended it to us.  My family of 5 spent 9 nights in July....Simply Spectacular!  Accommodations are elegant, location is prime( best in London), staff is attentive and graceful.  The culture of the Milestone is that of pure excellence in hospitality.  Entire staff was wonderful, however, Jose and Andrea in concierge and Grant in dining, were among the best in service that we have ever experienced.  The Milestone made each of us feel like Royalty.  We are already planning our return trip next Summer."
July 2015,Lovely in London but something just off,"Please, I don't consider this four star rating a negative at all.  It is a lovely old hotel in Kensington adjacent to the Kensington Palace and Hyde Park, a great, relatively quiet, convenient location in London.  The rooms are nice and excellently appointed in the old city style.  The restaurant was small, but stylish and had excellent service.  The bar was a beautiful, wood paneled and brass railed room with a horse racing theme.  An excellent place to decompress and relax after a day in London.  Where the Milestone really excelled was the service throughout.  Special kudos to Benny at the front desk, Andrea the concierge, Fabrizio, the restaurant manager, and Emmanuel the sommelier.  That being said, after having stayed at other Red Carnation properties, something here just‚Ä¶"
June 2015,Lovely Afternoon Tea at the Milestone Hotel,"We recently had the pleasure of enjoying afternoon tea at the Milestone Hotel in London. We thought it would be an enjoyable experience, but it far exceeded our expectations. The Park Lounge was a lovely setting, and the service was amazing from start to finish.   Once we were seated, our server asked what kinds of teas we liked, made recommendations, and poured our tea. It was delicious! In fact, our 19 year old son declared that it was the best tea that he‚Äôd ever tasted and the staff was kind enough to send him off with some to enjoy at home.  Our sandwiches and desserts were next, and they were superb! The presentation was spectacular, and we ate far more than we should have. After having had our fill of finger sandwiches, meringue lollipops, cupcakes with  wonderful passion‚Ä¶"
August 2014,Loved Everything,"We stayed 6 nights in June at the Milestone Apartments (apt#1) We are a family of 4 with kids 7 and 11.  We LOVED the Milestone.  Everyone was very nice but still professional  (especially Steven at the door).    The apartment was super roomy and cozy.  It had 2 bedrooms, 2 1/5 baths, lovely sitting room, and a very functional kitchen.  We didn't eat at the apartment as much as I thought we would...but it was nice to have.  We used the washer and dryer every day.      The location was perfect with two parks with great playgrounds nearby, lots of dining options, and a tube station a few minutes away.  The M&S food hall was a good spot for some prepared foods.      Our room rate came with breakfast and it was delicious every day.  It was funny how they interpreted chocolate chip‚Ä¶"
June 2015,"Nice,but not again","Stayed last summer with family. The hotel is very conveniently located, but is small and dated IMO. The service was excellent overall, we did receive a call one night from a woman at the front desk telling us of a complaint of noise from some other guests. I explained there was no one in our room and I had just come down the hall and heard the phone, she was rude and told me to keep it down anyway.  Lots of American tourists here, thanks to Trip Advisor and other lists. The excellent reviews on TA swayed us to try this hotel, but I would likely not choose it again without it having some major renovation."
July 2015,Perfect London Hotel,"I have stayed in London on two other occasions vacationing. The Milestone was by far the best. A beautiful property.  So refined!  The staff always went ""the extra mile"" to accommodate  us. The doorman was always cheerful. The concierge staff  helped us with travel plans. The check in and out went so smoothly.  Reception staff so friendly and efficient.  Also the food is great. We ate all our meals at the hotel because it was so delicious.  When I retuned to the US I realized that I left my IPad in my hotel room. I called them and they said no problem we will send it to you. I had my IPad back within the week!  This is the best hotel in London. You will be extremely satisfied!"
August 2014,Top hotel,"Stayed here for the first time recently on business. The hotel is one of the best in the area, service is next to none - all staff very accommodating and attentive. The hotel is a grand old building, but very well maintained and absolutely spotlessly clean...cleaners seem to work very hard with great care.  Restaurant food amazing..... Was only a flying visit, but am looking to come back soon for a stay with my partner."
May 2015,First Stop London,"This is a much overdue review of The Milestone.  What an absolutely wonderful experience.  My daughter and I took a trip of a lifetime last August.  London, Paris and Rome.  Our first stop, London.  AmEx helped make all of our arrangements and we chose The Milestone based on the tripadvisor reviews.  Last year The Milestone was ranked number 1, has fallen to number 2.  But I can't possibly imagine what the staff could have done better.  Congenial, comfortable and safe.  Not too far from the Tube."
June 2015,Outstanding Service and Elegant Location for Afternoon Tea,"While vacationing in London, I took my 4 year old granddaughter to the ""Little Princess"" afternoon tea at The Milestone Hotel.  From the moment we entered the hotel, all staff members we came in contact with were extremely friendly, kind and professional.  Each person gave special attention to my granddaughter and definitely made her feel as if she were a real princess.  Midway through our tea, she was presented with her own personal chef's apron and taken to a special dining room to decorate her very own yummy cupcake with their assistance.    We were seated in the cozy library close to the main lobby.  It was very tastefully  decorated and provided a comfortable setting.  We received outstanding service during our two hour tea time and tea and hot chocolate were kept refilled‚Ä¶"
May 2015,Nice choice,"Nice location for those who wish to avoid too  much racket and bustle. Nice service, as soon as you don't have (too) young receptionist on the day of arrival. Clean and comfortable, nicely decorated Deluxe suite, but the  cigarettes' smell that comes out of bathroom is unpleasant. The light snacks in the bar, well... This is less than nice. needs reassessment and refreshment. Good wifi, nice evening pianist in romantic and warm atmosphere."
June 2015,Ultimate pet friendly hotel,Great hotel to stay at if you have pets. We stayed one night with our dog and the staff were super welcoming.  Good location for doggy walks over the road in the park. Rooms are a bit busy for my liking and rather on the small size but very comfortable.
May 2015,Amazing afternoon tea,"I took my four and five year old girls to afternoon tea here and it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. The setting was very elegant and fitting for our Princess tea. Our waiter was amazing. He treated the girls like adults, gave them menus to read and just let them pretend they were grown ups. The food sandwiches, cakes and scones were delicious but far too much. I felt terrible that we left so much although they offered to box up my left overs for me. Overall it was a wonderful way to spend an afternoon and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
May 2015,Perfect on every level,"Brilliant location for getting about  some of the smarter areas of London as well as a few miles from some of the main attractions. The hotel was very luxurious in its service, its decor and its facilities - and when we had a problem with the room the manager just got it done with no fuss and minimum disruption or inconvenience. We had both the dinner and breakfast in the hotel and the quality was excellent - would recommend to anyone"
June 2015,Another superb visit to my other home,"I visited the Milestone for the second time in May and it was just as lovely and charming as before.  I have to give a huge thanks to Katie, Ilsa, Kasey, Nik, Josh, Jose, Bruce, Fran, oh my....too many to name. From Katie's assistance with moving my belongings from one room to another, after a slightly less than graceful dismount from my tub, to her smiling face when you arrived back from sightseeing. Bruce telling me where to get the best Chinese, then ordering it and bringing it to me. Josh telling me about comic con and helping print out tickets for several different events. Jose helping me report my lost camera. Fran helping me with my misbehaving TV. Kasey's ever present smile and humor. The rest of the reception staff for providing water and advice, the room service staff‚Ä¶"
June 2015,A must if ever visiting London,"Had the absolute pleasure of spending a night at the fantastic Milestones during our last visit to London. If you are looking for service and quality look no further! With it's great location you can enjoy fairytale views of the enchanting Kensington Palace - be sure to book a room facing Hyde Park! The style and interior design is breathtaking and you feel as if entering another decade upon check-in. Upon our arrival we were shown in to the Stables Bar where we were kindly offered welcome drinks and snacks. During our drinks Mr. Fran O'Hanlon, one of three wonderful dedicated butlers, retold the history of the property and once we've finished our drinks he gave us a tour of the rest of the Hotel. During this conversation I mentioned breafly that I was very interested in the‚Ä¶"
June 2015,Afternoon Tea,"Our experience of afternoon tea at The Milestone Hotel could not have been better. It was a sixtieth birthday family celebration, including two young children, and the staff were extremely accommodating, both when booking and on the afternoon itself. The children thoroughly enjoyed their cupcake decorating experience, dressed in chefs aprons, and the adults were extremely appreciative of the delicious food! Our waitress was charming and attentive and, although not cheap, the overall experience was worth every penny."
February 2015,This place is NOT over rated,"I was a little skeptical at the highest rating and had to try it.   The service is perfect - so attentive, the rooms are so detailed and unique, the breakfast is delicious and the tea time is the best I have had.  I'm so happy I choose this place and highly recommend booking through Amex as your get a ton of perks."
June 2015,Favourite London Hotel,"This is literally my favourite hotel in London and one of the best in Europe... Its literally sat opposite Kensington Palace which is a huge part of its charm. Its interior suits its location, very formally English however its flavour is a very cosy comfy English country sort of vibe.. The Hotel serves a traditional English afternoon tea, fabulous cocktails if desired.. Its location to all essential must see's in London and just on top of the West End. The Albert Hall is just around the corner.. I've stayed many times which is usually through the winter and its cosiness and charm makes for a definate return visit, time and time again .. Always a treat .."
June 2015,Great stay ....,"This beautiful, charming hotel is across the street from Hyde Park & Kensington Palace ---- a great location. The view of the Park from our room was very nice. Even being on a busy street there was very little noise. We had a peaceful, restful stay. This is a great location so walking was was a good option to several areas.  This staff really took pride in this hotel & their jobs --- this was obvious each minute of each day. We were always greeted with Smiling Faces & service was tops on their list.  As far as the bar & Restaurant, we found them to be good.  When back in London, we will stay here again ! "
May 2015,Such a lovely hotel,"My husband booked this hotel for our anniversary. From the moment we arrived we felt so welcome. The door man was such a lovely man who was so helpful with offering restaurant ideas and making sure we had a taxi etc. The reception desk staff were so polite, helpful and interested in where we were from and our reasons for the stay etc. Offering different services including help with restaurant choices, ideas of where we could visit in London and areas to avoid due to an event happening. We got shown around the hotel and shown to our room.  The room was lovely, over looking Hyde Park. The bathroom was a lovely size and very clean. Overall I love this hotel and definitely want to visit it again. Would love to bring the children so they can listen to the man playing the piano by the‚Ä¶"
June 2015,Truly a remarkable place.,"Across the busy street, we observe paparazzi stationed at entrance/exit points like bees surrounding a hive. Further up the lush green grounds, there is a long queue of global media personnel, electronic equipment, vans and transmission dishes, protected from the weather by a large, white tent-like tops. The media brandish microphones and cameras, and have already staked out Kensington Palace for a week, hoping to capture footage of visiting royals. Charlotte was born yesterday.   Staying in the Milestone Hotel, we are strategically located and in a far more lush boutique environment than that of the paparazzi. The Milestone was voted the ""Number One"" hotel in the UK and won the 2014 Trip Advisor Traveler's Choice award. it is a luxurious experience. And as you step inside you‚Ä¶"
June 2015,Very poor hotel,"A dreadful place, an old building, two in fact, conjoined and very claustropobhic. In the bar while another customer fell over on the marble floor with hidden steps, we paid ¬£85 for a round of drinks for 7. The food was OK but a chicken pie for ¬£27.00... I mean? It does not matter how rich you are, there are far better hotels and restaurants in London to take your money. Avoid this place as it is expensive and very poor. It is designed to extract the maximum from its customers. Please AVOID."
July 2014,"Fab hotel, fab location, excellent professional but friendly staff","I've travelled to every corner of the world and was surprised to visit my old home town and stay in probably the best hotel ever....breakfast chef definitely the best.  A great welcome from steven in his top hat (who came to my rescue as my handbag broke on the way out!)...4-5 staff immediately on hand when you enter, and its a small hotel.  Elsa went beyond the call of duty and had balloons and a yummy cake waiting for my birthday boyfriend.  I couldn't fault anything! They even light a candle in your bathroom at night....true class."
June 2015,Amazing,"Great food, great location, great breakfast, great rooms, great staff. As you have gathered by now this place is great!!!! Seriously, I could not remember something to fault them for.  The restaurant in the hotel is quite pricey but it is a real fine dining experience, I recommend you try it."
June 2015,60th Birthday Treat,"My girlfriend treated me to a wonderful London trip and we stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate my 60th birthday. It is, without question one of the best hotels we have been to. A beautiful, elegant building in a great location. All of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Our room was amazing. The English cooked breakfast was the best ever. There was even a home made chocolate birthday cake in our room upon arrival! We will certainly stay here again. Highly recommend."
June 2015,Good Taste of London,"Great service, great location. Staff was very welcoming on arrival. Size of room adequate for three. Excellent breakfast and had great dinner. About a 12 minute walk from the Underground, near Whole Foods and near the Parks. Highly recommend this hotel."
March 2015,Delightful stay,"Stayed here for the first week of June. Could not have had a more delightful stay at any hotel. They made us feel like one of the family in their home. The hotel is like an old sophisticated Kensington manor house. Everyone from the Doormen, reception, management, Concierge, Bar and restaurant staff and housekeeping were the best ever.  Breakfast was amazing, the Stables Bar was the best ever. They gave us many non-tourist suggestions for places to see and great local eateries. You must try Fiona's a few blocks for the hotel."
March 2015,Fantastic Hotel - Wonderful Stay,"We were booked for a one night stay as we were going to see The Who playing for Teenage Cancer Trust at Royal Albert Hall, from the moment we walked through the front door until the moment we left, the staff were fantastic, helping in whichever way they could.  Our room was on the 4th floor, The Jungle Room, so quite, you would not believe you were on a busy street in Kensington.  Breakfast was delicious, as were the complimentary Biscuits delivered to our room.  Thank you for a great stay, we will certainly be returning."
March 2015,birthday treat,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Milestone on a  birthday trip to The Albert Hall and I cannot praise this hotel enough. The premises are quirky and full of character and history and the staff full of knowledge of the past of the premises. On arrival we were given a tour of the premises which is something new to me and helped us to find our way around. All of the staff were excellent, friendly, cheerful, proficient and only too willing to help. Altogether a great visit which made a special occasion even more special. I would rate this hotel as one of the best London hotels I have ever stayed in and can't wait for my next visit,"
March 2015,Wonderful hotel,"Took a short weekend in London, including a night at the Milestone. A beautiful hotel with wonderful and helpful staff, who know the difference been good service and being intrusive. Room was everything it should be, food was as good as expected and nothing was too much trouble  A wonderful hotel"
March 2015,So Relaxing,"This was the first time I'd stayed at the Hotel and it will now be my first choice when travelling to London. I stayed here a week ago in a Deluxe Room. The room was high up on the 5th floor. Even though the room was next to a lift I heard nothing in all the time I was there, inside the Hotel or noise from outside. I enjoyed drinks in the bar on 2 occasions and the friendliness of all the staff was what stood out to other Hotels in London. The hotel is right across the road to Hyde Park, which is great for a walk at any time. If you want a big brash busy hotel don't come here but if you want a quiet hotel that has that extra personal touch, it's the place to come."
March 2015,Birthday treat. ,"I stayed at The Milestone Hotel with my Mother, as a belated birthday treat.  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left nothing was too much trouble. The small gifts and welcome card made us feel special. I was even surprised by  delicious birthday cake. üéÇ We are planning on returning later in the year along with my brother and his wife for a weekend.  The service was excellent but more importantly everyone seemed to be happy in their job.  The breakfast was amazing, a wide choice made deciding what to eat different. I finally chose the vegetarian breakfast..yummy !  Lovely hotel with lovely people. "
March 2015,Our Home in London,"My husband and I travel to London often and we've stayed at a number of London hotels. When we discovered the Milestone, we've decided it's our home away from home when we're in London. We love their breakfast and tea rooms, the staff is genuinely cheerful and friendly, the location is impeccable and we are treated like honoured guests in a very fine home. We are often tempted to go to London just to stay a few nights at the Milestone."
March 2015,Outstanding.,"Simply one of the best hotels I've stayed in. Went to London to watch a show so booked in for two nights. From the moment we arrived,the staff were so helpful,corteous and polite. The room was lovely as was the rest of the hotel. Afternoon tea is not to be missed,but make sure you're not on a diet as there was no frugal offering,we couldn't finish it!!!!  The standards are set high and they achieve them. Would definitely recommend anyone to stay here,we are going back again in May and taking are daughters with us. 10/10 easily. Thank you.  Mr Knowles"
March 2015,45th wedding anniversary,"We had a wonderful stay in the milestone. We could not fault it and we have stayed in many hotels and there would always be something that was not up to scratch. They deserve to have five stars. Thank you to all the staff , for the champagne petals and candles in our room.  Magic.  I recommend  This hotel 100 percent. Kind regards  Florence Fitzmaurice"
March 2015,It doesn't get better than this!,"My wife and son and I were lucky to have spent 9 days in one of the Milestone's apartments, which feature complimentary access to all hotel facilities.  This place is the top of the top.  The staff are generous, delightful, attentive and would do anything make your stay the best it can be.  All the small touches and amenities around the room were the best.  They have thought of everything!  I've stayed at a number of 5-star properties but Milestone was completely in a class by itself.  I can imagine anyone would be quickly warmed to the old-world charm and comforts embraced by their staff and residences."
February 2015,Absolutely stunning hotel and wonderful staff,"Our first experience at this hotel and we will definitely be back.  We came to London to pick up a puppy we had acquired and the hotel was not only accommodating, we a dog bed, water bowl, food bowl, towels for puppy, gift for puppy, name tag for puppy !  The hotel reminds one of the glorious English elegance; lovely wood panelling, gorgeous perfume of cleanness all through the hotel and the restaurant is superb!  Thank you especial to Benjamin and front desk staff and manager for your kindness and hospitality."
February 2015,The WOW factor,"A beautiful hotel with a fantastic history, the attention to detail and the attentiveness and welcoming given by the staff was second to none.  Just opposite Kensington Gardens, a fantastic location too."
February 2015,"OK, this is really good!",This was our second time at the Milestone and we loved it the first time.  We were upgraded to a suite with a spectacular view of the Hyde Park and Kennsington Palace directly across the street.  The staff is simply great...I am amazed they can remember my name!  The room was impeccable.  Just a really great time in London.
February 2015,WOW...NOT EVEN CHECKED IN YET,"I am compelled to write a review on how exceptional the concierge Jose has been.  I am staying at the hotel in two weeks but have corresponding back and forth with hotel since December.  No request has been too small and I have been a royal pain.  Jose has gone above and beyond in not just answering questions but doing research and getting back to me.  For example,  my daughter is doing a semester abroad and was in need of a dentist for her wisdom tooth.  I emailed Jose and a few minutes later I had a dentist.  He also arranged wonderful theatre seats for me showing me the location of the seats and kindly holding the seats for a day until I could finalize plans.  In fact, the theatre seats were better than platinum concierge could get for me with NO upcharge.   I haven't even‚Ä¶"
February 2015,Outstanding afternoon tea,"We had not booked a stay at this hotel, but arranged an afternoon tea to celebrate a Significant Birthday of my wife!  From our arrival, we could not have been looked after any better.  The service (provided by Alexandre and his colleague) was very attentive, but unobtrusive - we felt that our needs were carefully monitored, but we were left to enjoy our celebration without undue interruption.  The sandwiches, scones and cakes were very obviously freshly prepared, and the cakes were carefully explained (which added to their delicious quality).   Our tea cups were replenished  as soon as they were empty, and pot of fresh tea brought to our table without our having to ask.   We did not feel in the least bit hurried.   The last remaining three or four cakes, which had defeated us‚Ä¶"
February 2015,Full of suprises,"We booked this hotel as we had some work to attend to in London, where we normally stay around Marylebone area. Well, we will definitely be back to this hotel, from the moment we checked in we was made to feel more than welcome, with a drink offered in the conservatory whilst our room was being prepared, then when we got shown to our room, it was lovely, well proportioned, and very well decorated. I would recommend an evening meal at this hotel, as not only is the food very nice, and well priced (especially for London) the pianist was exceptional :) we had a very good night with him, and after dinner decided to return to our room, as we had, had a long day of travelling, etc, and we thought the pianist had retired for the evening, as we had not heard him for around 10 minutes,‚Ä¶"
February 2015,Very mixed feelings,"Positive: The hotel was booked as a Valentine day celebration and with the upgrade to the Princess Suite 501 we thought that everything is going to be amazing.  Certainly the hotel knows how to welcome you from the moment you step out of the taxi: friendly and polite faces willing to show you around or taking care of your smallest of needs.  We passed a rather boring corridor on the 5th floor to be welcomed by the most beautiful suite (facing the back of the building, which is very quiet) I have seen in a hotel: a very large sitting area (as per my pictures), you do not know where to look first.  Every single corner has small touches and not decorated sparsely as would be the case with other hotels: you have little pillows, statues, China,  paintings, orchids etc besides the‚Ä¶"
February 2015,Amazing Hotel,"I arranged this hotel as was recommended by the Royal Albert Hall.  I knew from arranging our accomodation on the phone which was very professional  I would not be disappointed.  We had the 'african' room which was delightful and cosy and the hotel made a princess bed for our 7 year old daughter who accompanied us. As I had notified the hotel of my partners birthday we were greeted with a delicious choc cake and a complimentary glass of champagne along with hand signed cards which was extremely thoughtful and much appreciated.   We were welcomed with warm smiles, and very friendly staff, instantly feeling at home, we had a guided tour by the lovely Georgia Woods, who could not have been any more helpful and at hand to our needs.  She was very professional and friendly and whilst‚Ä¶"
November 2014,Always a delight,"Andrew, Fran, Shane, Manny and all the Milestone team live their pillars of a home away from home. It is always a delight for my husband and I to stay here, they are beyond fabulous and I always feel so welcome. Nothing is too much and given at times I arrive here stressed, it's like a haven where I can recharge. Thanks guys!"
February 2015,Excellent,"Best hotel ever , real treat, staff very very friendly and helpful, i wasn t bothered sightseeing London too much, because i didn t want to leave the comfort and cosy ness of the Hotel. Will go back again,if possible!Highly recommendable, even for the most demanding amongst us..."
March 2015,Characterful Country House hotel in Kensington,"The Milestone is a stunning, comfortable hotel with a lot of history and all the staff are very friendly and welcoming. I like that there are different areas to sit and eat/ drink, ranging from the Stables bar to the cosy tearoom and the retro black and white conservatory. The artwork is amazing and gives the hotel a very personal touch. Everything is very well thought out, with great attention to detail. Finger sandwiches for lunch were light and delicious and my boyfriend loved the cheeseboard- no bland cheeses there! In the evening we had a wonderful dinner, guinea fowl for my boyfriend and gnocchi for me- vegetarians are very well catered for on all the menus here and are not treated as an inconvenience. The breakfast is superb with eggs Benedict and Florentine being a‚Ä¶"
March 2015,First class,"We stayed as we were seeing Madame Butterfly at the Albert Hall. The hotel is a short walk from the hall, opposite Hyde Park and near Kensington High St. The building and rooms are lovely and of the Regency period. The staff are excellent. The hotel was featured in the Sunday Times as being one of the best companies to work for and it shows in the care and attention you receive. Genuinely helpful and couldn't be better - well done to the Milestone Team. "
March 2015,Everyone is right.  It's that simple.,"Just spent a week at the Milestone with my son.  Got back last night and I'm already writing this review.  OUTSTANDING HOTEL.  From the minute we arrived to the moment we left, this hotel experience was top notch in every way.    Now for the irony:  Our room was not ready when we arrived and the room we checked into was too small for me and my teenage boy.  The way the staff (Beth you are a consummate pro) handled this situation from beginning to end was flawless.  Let's face it:  Things will go wrong at even at the finest hotels.  The experience you have when things go wrong is far more telling than the experience you have when all goes as planned.  When our room was not ready, we were kindly guided to the gorgeous conservatory and fed a delightful lunch on the house.  When I‚Ä¶"
March 2015,"We felt more like ""old friends"" than like guests!","As a family with two children we had the opportunity to stay for a week in the Victoria&Albert apartment of The Milestone Hotel located directly at Kensington Gardens, London. The apartment was spacious (two bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms, a large living room and a very well equipped kitchen) and we felt that the interior design was typical for Great Britain. The whole staff was incredibly helpful, and we felt well very well accommodated, e.g. my wife and me had some problems with the pillows provided, but when we mentioned this to the concierge, he showed us the hotel¬¥s ""pillow menu"" and we were provided with most comfortable memory foam pillows, thus, in the remaining nights we slept perfectly well! Even short-timed questions as ""Could you get us 4 cards for the musical‚Ä¶"
February 2015,Thank you all so much.,"Dear Andrew and staff.  This hotel is the best of the best.  My wife and I stayed 4 nights at The Milestone, and I do not know how it possibly could have better.  All of the staff(too many to name) were very helpful and accommodating.  Superior service, coupled with a genuine friendly attitude made our stay very memorable. Thank you all so much for your warmth and hospitality. D.Wagner, MD"
January 2015,First class service !! Lovely hotel all around.,We just returned from spending two nights at the Milestone.  The staff was wonderful and they make you feel so welcome.  We had the Matisse room --- ceilings are a bit low and there area few steps down.  It was beautifully furnished. It has small windows and is rather dark.  The welcome note and basket was much appreciated.  We also enjoyed a proper cream tea -- and a trip to the bar was met by a wonderful bartender who clearly takes pride in his job and the hotel  Breakfast a delicious experience.  We would happily stay here again.
February 2015,magic moments,have a goodnight sleep here Plenty to do   You can do all most anything here Night life is amazing local bars Maybe an adventure for you And very disability friendly lifts Ramps   You try it you will have a good time
February 2015,Living like royalty,"we stayed with our children (7&9 year old girls) and only had positive experiences. The staff was extremely warm and welcoming on arrival and the concierge team was very helpful throughout our stay in London. The restaurant at the hotel was first rate and the high tea was something our girls will soon not forget. The hotel location was ideal across the street from Kensington Gardens a few minute walk to several museums, shopping, restaurants and the tube. Every night we looked forward to receiving a small treat as part of the turn down service. We would definitely stay here again."
February 2015,WOW! This is the best hotel experience I have ever had,"I have worked in hotels and food & drink for a long time now and I have never, ever experienced service like I experienced last night from anyone - full stop.  Every member of staff that I came into contact with knew my name. Plus the (small) big things like the soap selections in the room, quality of brands on show and how guest centric the entire hotel is. It was just incredible.  The team were outstanding - Ben, Augustine (sorry if I got that one wrong), Leona, Marianne, The Concierges, the doormen. Every single one of them is a gem. Knowledgable, helpful, interested in you all with a nothing is too much trouble attitude.  A special mention goes to the restaurant and bar. I have to say the scallops and the steak are the best I have ever had, hands down. The wine selection was‚Ä¶"
January 2015,Flawless!,"Flawless experience in London.  Fantastic location and service in every domain was excellent.  Large room for London with nice amenities.  The ""welcome drink"" in the bar was a nice touch and much needed after traveling for over 12 hours.  Beautiful hotel, we will certainly return."
November 2014,Prince Albert Suite! always and forever,"We arrived in a Bentley, and were treated like kings! we were celebrating our 5th anniversary and  our check in staff, his name was Jose, he was absolutely welcoming and seamless in the process. He indiciated our room was one of the best and proceeded for our bags to be taken up whilst we enjoyed a glass of Moscato, which is my favourite.  Arriving into our palatial suite, we hard our jaws hit the floor, it was certainly worth every penny. The views i wouldve gladly killed for, my bedroom was bigger than my living room at home and the bath, i wanted to drown happily aha!  We informed them we liked to entertain a few friends for a dinner party, they couldnt be more obliging! set up the table in a most efficient and classy fashion. As our guests arrived, each were handed a glass‚Ä¶"
October 2014,MJR- my recent stay at The Milestone Hotel,"Having stayed previously at the Milestone Hotel we wanted a hotel in the area that fulfilled all our requirements. With good memories from our earlier visit the rebooking decision was straightforward. Often a revisit never matches the first visit but this hotel is so different with such  depth to all its services and qualities. Reluctant to leave, we are already thinking of a reason to arrange a future stay when in London as The Milestone Hotel really does specialise in quality and addictive indulgence."
November 2014,Clearly the BEST Boutique Hotel in London,"I highly recommend the Milestone Hotel for their excellent service, d√©cor and food.  From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave there are friendly staff, who know your name, and are committed to attending to your every need.  I was personally greeted by Andrew, the General Manager, who made me feel more at home.  Being an avid National Trust member, Andrew personally gave me a tour of the hotel, showing me all of the wonderful rooms and services that I could enjoy during my visit. Although small, the hotel has everything you could expect for a 5star establishment, a well equipped gym and personal trainer service, spa, swimming pool, and many areas to enjoy fine or casual dining.  I personally enjoyed listing to the skilled pianist!  During my visit I very much enjoyed‚Ä¶"
September 2014,Commitment to excellent service,"I highly recommend the Milestone Hotel for their excellent service. From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave there are friendly staff, who know your name, and are committed to attending to your every need, from concierge, to dining to business and relaxation services. You can't go wrong with this excellent and impeccably decorated hotel. Jamie Turkington"
November 2014,"Best in London, outstanding service, rooms, location","I have stayed in The Milestone many times. One year I was their most frequent visitor. My favorite hotel, certainly in London. Directly at Hyde Park in South Kensington it has a really nice location. All rooms are individually decorated, all in old English style. You will love them even though the rooms are small. Staff is very attentive. I love the place."
November 2014,Amazing Stay,"I stayed here on the 01 November as a present to my wife, the hotel staff and service was superb. they even baked a cake for her at no extra charge. The breakfast is very good, highly recommend the eggs benedict....cannot fault the room and they have full sky tv !!"
October 2014,My favourite Hotel anywhere,"This is the third time I have stayed at the Milestone and I did not think it could get better, but every time it does.  The staff are so dedicated and warm.  The service is unobtrusively excellent.  The food is delicious.  The ambiance is perfectly British in the very best sense.  It is cosy, comfortable, discrete, and I would stay for weeks if I could. Thanks to all the wonderful staff under the leadership of Andrew Pike.  Hope to see you again.  Helen Zille"
October 2014,You won't be disappointed!,"We recently took our first trip to London celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. The Milestone is a small hotel with fantastic personal service and an amazing staff. Colin picked us up from the airport in the hotel's range rover and his wonderful warm welcome set the tone for the whole stay. The restaurant provides an intimate and lovely dining experience, and the bar was fun. When we returned to our room the first night  whole place was sprinkled with rose petals! Milestone, if you are reading this...... Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
October 2014,"Awesome Service, Great Room, Excellent Atmosphere!","We just got back from a 6 night stay at The Milestone Hotel and are still in awe of the experience that we had. This was our first time being in London.  We booked our stay through Costco for our trip to see the Lions accidentally beat the Falcons (yay!).  Our concierge service was outstanding, EVERY question that we had was answered and pleasantly handled...even the most mundane questions. When you're there make sure to seek out Andrea as he took a little more interest in us (he has Michigan ties).  The room was beautiful and very quiet. The cleaning staff was beyond reproach and just as helpful and friendly as everyone else.  Our package also included a Daily English Breakfast, which was great. The main restaurant, Cheneston's, was outstanding. We had dinner there our first‚Ä¶"
October 2014,Up for a show,We came up to London for a show at the Albert Hall and stayed a night at the Milestone.  This is a special place in London as it it quite a small hotel but the service really is first class.  The staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble.  We were shown around by Pedro when we arrived (thank you) and later in the evening enjoyed an excellent meal  served early as we wanted to eat before the show.  I think the hotel is good value considering the location and the city.  We will definitely stay here again.  One thing to note - I was concerned  about noise in the night as we live in an extremely quiet rural area - I should not have worried the room is well insulated from the nightime city life !
September 2014,Great Stay at The Milestone,"My wife and I stayed at The Milestone from Oct 9-12th then again on October 25th for one night around a cruise from South Hampton. Great all around experience and location, our stay was outstanding. Special thanks to Steven at the front door who was a great help and a terrific chap and Benjamin in the bar who we enjoyed very much spending time with. We expect to be back in May."
August 2014,5 Star Service,"This is a small intimate hotel in a great location near Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. It is in walking distance from shopping and dining options. The Hotel has intimate common areas in which to relax, read or visit with other guests. The restaurant is excellent .  I strongly recommend you have a dinner there. A generous breakfast is included each morning if you book directly with the hotel. The entire Hotel staff is amazing!  They go above and beyond fulfilling your requests. It is obvious they enjoy their jobs and are invested in making your visit a special one."
August 2014,Wonderful hotel in London.,"Great staff. Great location. Gorgeous, fabulous decor. Very comfortable. Food was excellent. Loved the little Winston Churchill quotes book they left on the pillow as well as all the little treats. Worth the price."
August 2014,It was a wonderful experience,"Though the rooms are a bit small everything else is grand; the staff, the amenities; the breakfast and the desire to please . Everything was personalized and the concierge was excellent. The glass conservatory is a wonderful place for a drink, and the afternoon touches of fruit or scones are lovely to come home to."
July 2014,An excellent London hotel,"This is a really ""nice"" hotel.  The staff are warm and friendly, the decor perfect.  My wife arrived back from shopping in a cab to find she only had ""Old Pounds"" the doorman quickly paid the cab driver and took care of the problem.   The atmosphere is English, calm and understated, you don't feel as if you are in chain hotel that could be anywhere."
August 2014,Best Five Star Experience Ever!,"From the moment we arrived, I knew we'd ""arrived."" We were very early, but they changed our original room to one that would be ready much sooner and offered us tea and biscuits in the lovely front parlor.  Our room was unusual with bathroom on one level and bedroom a few steps up, but lovely bedding and decor.  Loved the different pillow treats each turndown.  Our breakfasts were delicious served in a charming dining room with a fireplace (no need for extra warmth in July though). The bar was so British library. I'm sorry I didn't have time for a drink there.   Our favorite doorman, Stephen, made us feel safe while we watched a 25K person protest on our street.  Very interesting to see something like that for us small town Texas women.    If I ever get back to London I hope I‚Ä¶"
July 2014,Good central location,"We've just returned from a lovely 3 day break in London and can highly recommend it. Giles warmly welcomed us, and there were many thoughtful touches. For example, I asked at breakfast the first day for maple syrup and it arrived on day two!"
July 2014,Great London Hotel,The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding.  Across from Hyde Park. Consider getting the two bedroom apartment instead of two separate rooms. We will definitely stay there on our next London trip.
August 2014,Wonderful Experience,We stayed at the Milestone the second week of July and had a wonderful experience.  The location is terrific with easy access to public transportation.  The hotel itself is beautiful.  The service from the staff could not have been better.  We hope to stay here again in the years to come.
August 2014,Perfect in every way!,"We had our wedding celebration at The Milestone last weekend and it could not have been more perfect. From the welcome both we and our  guests received to the delicious food, service and accommodation we would not have changed anything. The hotel is in a fabulous location opposite Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and so has good transport links for central London as well as amazing views. We had great fun with Manvee  planning the event and we very grateful to Grant and Fabrizio for putting it all together on the day and making the room look amazing. These guys accommodated our every request with no problem or question. Every staff member we came across was friendly helpful and professional. The day was finished off perfectly when we went back to our room and found rose‚Ä¶"
October 2013,Outstanding,"I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world and The Milestone truly tops them all. My wife and I has 2 nights there on 13th and 14th August and were treated to an upgrade on arrival. The suite was beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough to help. It sounds like a cliche to say we were treated like royalty but I can think of no other way to describe it. From the doorman on our arrival, to the delightful reception ladies on check in, to Pedro who showed us around introducing us to all of the team, to the helpful concierge who arranged a car for us for an afternoon's sight seeing, to the barman who made us a special cocktail as we couldn't decide from the menu.....I could go on. The location of the hotel is literally opposite Kensington gardens and is also convenient‚Ä¶"
September 2014,FAVORITE OF AN INDEFATIGABLE TRAVELER,"I for one like to stay at a hotel that has the sensibilities of its culture in the decor. I like palace with immaculate and warm service ( Who needs snooty service when your miles away from home?) I love warm, old world charm and intimacy.  The Milestone is  fondly  noted as one of my favorite places, because it stands up to my criteria hands down.I would highly recommend it."
October 2013,Just Had to Post Again About this Fabulous Hotel!,"I've written about The Milestone a few times before but I feel compelled to be effusive again.   This is a quintessential London hotel right in the heart of Kensington.   Your neighbors across the street at Kensington Palace are Will and Kate!    I travel all over the world on business and The Milestone is my favorite hotel in the world.   Location, service, quality of rooms, dining, tea, ambience-- this place has it all.   If you need anything, the wonderful concierge will be at your service.    The bartender, Marko, is the best around and makes perfect martinis.  I love the rooms-- they are all different and unique.  Some of the standard rooms are pretty small so upgrade if you can for more comfort.     Greatness starts at the top so I have to assume they are extremely‚Ä¶"
September 2014,Lovely Afternoon Tea at The Milestone,"On our first trip to London, we tried to get reservations at the more well-known tea places, but were unable to land a spot; so, we booked The Milestone for Afternoon Tea instead.  Tea was served in a small charming room with a few tables, sofas and chairs off the lobby. The service was excellent, with a nice selection of teas. Our waiter efficiently and gracefully kept replenishing out tea.  The petite finger sandwiches were good, the scones with Devonshire cream, excellent, with quite a nice selection of pastries.   This is not a place to see and be seen, rather a place to come with dear friends or family, relish the quiet intimate atmosphere.  This was our first tea in London, so we are not able to compare it to other places; but, we enjoyed our afternoon here, and, would‚Ä¶"
September 2014,"Service, service, service","If you want a large modern hotel, this is not the place for you. If you want big and modenrn go to the Shangri La Hotel at the Shard.  However, if you want a quintessential small English inn experience, this is the place.  I felt like Bono at the Milestone - total rockstar treatment.  My only regret is that our stay was not longer.  Our room was small but immaculately appointed and clearly recently immaculately redone; I gave four stars, not five, on the rooms, however, because the size of the room was quite small.  The mattress and linens were divine.  Did I mention the great service?"
July 2014,Unexpected service,"I chose to stay at the Milestone for my last night in London. I picked the hotel because it was close to Paddington and the restaurant I wanted to dine at (Petrus). From the minute you walk in, you feel a warm welcome. I had stayed at another Red Carnation hotel (the Oyster Box in Durban) and had the same experience. The service is exceptional. From the welcome drink in the conservatory to the turn down service in the evening, everything was impeccable. It was also an ideal location right next to Hyde Park. I would definitely recommend the hotel to others and would be likely to return."
August 2014,Fabulous find!,"Over the top service, quintessentially British boutique hotel.  Beautiful room, sublimely comfortable bed, unbelievable buffet breakfast.  We enjoyed the hotel's private airport car service---definitely take advantage of that.  We were traveling with our 12 year old granddaughter, and really appreciated the bedroom with separate private sleeping area for her, and the most delicious chocolate birthday cake they delivered to our room for her birthday.  Hotel is convenient to tube station a couple of blocks away, and is not far from Harrod's.  Concierge arranged restaurants for us, shipped luggage back to the US for our son who had studied in London all summer, and even helped with arrangements for us in Italy, where we were headed when we left London!  Lots of small thoughtful‚Ä¶"
September 2014,Extraordinary experience!,"We have traveled world wide and have found the Milestone to be, by far, the most exquisite boutique hotel in our experience. The property is well located with views of Kensington Palace and across the street from Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens with lots of fun play areas for children. Each guest room is unique and tastefully decorated.  But what makes this such a wonderful hotel is the staff. Your are greeted at the door by welcoming bellmen who escort you into the beautiful lobby and are further greeted by an exceptional front desk staff.  The concierges, Jose, Andrea and Joshua  and the butler, Fran, go above and beyond to help you navigate your way through London and beyond and can answer any questions you might have with such professionalism.  They are truly remarkable. ‚Ä¶"
September 2014,Fantastic stay,"Great food, clean rooms and top notch service can not find 1 single fault with this hotel, i was here on business but will be returning shortly. The hotel itself is in a great location for visiting the Kensington Palace which was good it gave me the opportunity to take in some local history. The restaurant is excellent i would recommend it. Thanks Fran for the great service!"
August 2014,A Gem in the heart of Kensington!,I cannot rate this hotel highly enough. A gorgeous building in the heart of Kensington that has so much charm and tradition within.  We had a very warm welcome given to us and the service throughout our stay was exceptional. Staff were lovely and so so helpful. The attention to detail in the rooms are of the highest standard. I  Would stay here at The Milestone Hotel over and over again.
August 2013,Wonderful experience,"We had a wonderful stay at the Milestone Hotel in London.The hotel is in a great location for visiting Kensington Palace,good shops nearby and lovely views overlooking Kensington Gardens. We were welcomed by a very courteous  member of concierge Fran who showed us around the hotel before showing us to the Regency suite. This was a most luxurious suite overlooking Kensington Gardens.There were various luxurious items for our use laid around the room. We had drinks in the beautiful conservatory after dinner with our family and enjoyed the ambience there very much. The staff in the hotel could not have made us more welcome and this made my birthday weekend there very memorable. Highly recommended."
June 2014,Classic Hotel,The Milestone is one of the best hotels to stay at in London. The services were excellent. Breakfast was delicious and a traveler feels like it is their home when staying there. We would definitely go back
May 2014,Another wonderful stay!,Our 2nd visit this year to The a Milestone. The romantic turndown was very special with champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries. Thanks to all the staff at this wonderful hotel for yet again making our stay so lovely.
June 2014,Traditional hotel in Kensington,"We stayed here for one night at the end of a London/Paris trip before we flew out of Heathrow the next day.  My husband and I are 30 and I wanted to splurge on the last night of our trip.  This is a traditional, mature hotel that I would probably recommend for an older crowd.  Upon our arrival, we booked afternoon tea for that afternoon, which we loved.  The food was delicious, especially the scones, and we had a great time.  That evening we walked through Kensington Gardens, right across the street.  The staff was great and we arranged for coffee in our room with the wake-up call early the next morning.  They also helped us figure out the most economical way to get to the aiport since we did not want to take a private car (we love quality public transportation).  The only‚Ä¶"
June 2014,Fox News and Really Fast Easy WIFI!,"We arrived a bit early on Sunday but the room was ready. We were offered a tour of the facilities and learned all we needed to know. It really is like being in someone's home.    #202 King was a good room on the back side, so quiet.   After freshening up a bit we went down to the Stables Bar to have our complimentary drink. Listen all you dopes, obviously we paid 510 per night and a free drink doesn't matter, but it does. It started a really valuable relationship with the lads at the bar. I'm horrible at names, they were from Italy. They listened to what we liked and made some amazing suggestions. We arrived one day when the lads weren't there and the other bartender knew our names and what  we wanted. Order the mixed sandwiches, really good. And they have Twiglets for bar‚Ä¶"
June 2014,Gorgeous hotel with lots of old English charm,"I have just returned from a mini break to London for my 30th birthday. My husband chose the Milestone as a surprise and he couldn't have picked a nicer place. The staff were lovely and very accommodating I stupidly forgotten a brush for example rang down and they found me one within minutes. Our room was a safari suite and it had great decor, the bed was extremely comfortable. The room was all very clean and we had a lovely view over the gardens I think the only thing people may struggle with is the shower height as fairly low but there is large bath and hose type shower to use.... This wasn't actually an issue for us at all, but thought may help other specify rooms etc.... The afternoon tea was delicious it is fairly expensive but you do get a fair amount of food and‚Ä¶"
June 2014,"Ok hotel, but dont understand its over the top rating","Nice hotel, but a hotel like many others. Small, ""dusty"" rooms, old facilities (bathroom, TV, AC, etc), old (and again ""dusty"") furniture, old windows with bad isolation - i.e.  a typical London, Paris or Rome hotel that attempts to create an ""old Europe"" feel but is simply just old and stuffy.  Service and food are good, but not excellent. There are many comparable hotels in London and I really really dont understand how so many excellent reviews and so few average ones came about. Just because there is a welcome drink? There is really nothing super special about this place - as I said, its good, but definitely not in the top 10 in Lindon. Just the location and the look of the hotel from the outside (esp. during xmas) are really great - but even that has a drawback since the‚Ä¶"
June 2014,Perfect Hotel,This is a perfect hotel with  a very convenient and central location. This hotel deserves to be  the  recipient of a  Travelers Choice. Award. It is such a charming hotel with an exceptional staff.  The service was extraordinary.The room was very nice and comfortable. I look forward to our next visit.
June 2014,An amazing experience,"An amazing experience:  Upgraded free of charge. Fresh fruit in the room Luxury Sheets and Towels Complimentary Champagne, and Bottled Water, and soaps etc Fresh Flowers throughout the hotel. Room cleaned twice a day, even picking our clothes up and putting them on the hangers. Gorgeous Breakfast, with an amazing choice. Room peaceful, and fully air conditioned Gorgeous Shower Turndown service a must have Order Tea or coffee to the room, and get fabulous free biscuits with it (and a flower) Nothing to much trouble Want to know the best places to eat ask desk staff, wonderful local knowledge, want a taxi just ask, want an umbrella just ask, in fact anything we wanted we could have.

April 2014,Perfect hotel for daughters's graduation gift!!,"Two weeks ago, my husband and I took our two daughters to London for their high school/college graduations.  We were simply overjoyed with our stay at The Milestone.  Their service is impeccable!  The breakfast was loaded with many goodies, more than ever needed.  The rooms, both deluxe and junior suites were superior.  The girls' room was absolutely adorable and perfect for them in a powder blue velvet with double twin canopies!  A surprise birthday cake was even delivered for one daughter's birthday!  Candles were lit in the evening in the master bath when we returned at night.  The observatory was one of our favorites stops for a drink or respite.  Both bartenders knew our special drinks and always had them ready.  Immaculada, our waitress for breakfast was  perfect!  Other‚Ä¶"
August 2014,convenient location,the bus stop in front of the hotel is very convenient.  the concierge is helpful. i suggest you contact them in advance for questions. the room is very clean and has nice amenities.  the afternoon tea was disappointing.  i thought it was expensive and not worth it.
August 2014,Great hotel and great staff.,"We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is very nice, our room was perfect. The whole staff is very pleasant and friendly and knew us by name. The breakfast is excellent too! I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to London."
August 2014,Excellent choice for afternoon tea,"We had tea at the Milestone and it was fabulous. The ambiance and service were second to none. The tea was excellent and the sandwiches, cakes, and scones were beautiful and ever so tasty. I would love to stay at this lovely hotel the next time we are in London. It is an incredible property."
July 2014,Wonderful hotel where the staff goes above and beyond to meet your every request!,"We just completed a 3 night family vacation at The Milestone. The hotel is quaint and decorated as a beautiful English home. Each hotel room is decorated differently. We had two rooms and one was more beautiful then the other. The breakfast buffet is great with many options. Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu.  The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you.  We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy.  The personal service was the best we have experienced in any‚Ä¶"
August 2014,London's best home,"The Milestone is a unique experience in itself. The staff has an acute attention to your needs which makes you feel wellcome and at home. From the moment you arrive to when you leave you have everything is within reach.  We stayed for three nights and enjoyed every second of them. Details like extra thick glass in the rooms to block out traffic noise lets you sleep longer, a magnificent breakfast, the most friendly concierge and a lounge piano player who really knows his stuff made our stay unique.   The Milestone is our new home in London!"
July 2014,Suburb Afternoon Tea,"We had afternoon tea at the Milestone last year & it was suburb. This year we tried a different hotel for tea & while it was nice, it lacked the sophistication & special touches the Milestone offer. So, we went back to the Milestone for tea again this year. The staff are all very welcoming & friendly. They were helpful with the stroller & had a high hair for us. The kids each had their own pot of hot chocolate & their own mini tea tray, which they were thrilled with. Our adult tea was excellent, every item was delicious & beautifully presented. The champagne was also lovely. It'd be hard to try anywhere else for tea when the Milestone delivers such phenomenal food & service. "
August 2014,Simply the Best,"My husband and I stayed at the Milestone for 10 days in late July 2014, our third visit.  The Milestone is simply the best hotel in London.  Outstanding service, friendly and knowledgeable staff, the concierge team was outstanding, fast and very capable.  Be sure to take advantage of the various services offered, including the drivers, like Colin, who took us on a wonderful tour to Bath and Windsor Castle.  The Master Suite where we stayed was extremely luxurious and had anticipated every need and comfort as well as lots of extras mentioned in some of the other reviews.  The location cannot be improved--across the street from Kensington Palace with Kensington Gardens that adjoins Hyde Park--allows for a beautiful view as well as outstanding exercise and picnic opportunities. ‚Ä¶"
August 2014,Superb 5 Star Experience,"We just returned home from an 8 day trip to London where my husband and two teen sons stayed at The Milestone Hotel.  From the time of my reservation inquiry through our departure, we could not have asked for a better experience.  The reservation and front desk staff responded to all my communications in a prompt and courteous manner, and the hotel staff including the concierges and housekeeping staff were amazing during our stay.  The entire staff was kind and helpful and genuinely interested in making certain we had a wonderful stay.  My son celebrated his 14th birthday during our stay and they delivered a birthday cake to his room!  The rooms and the decor of the hotel is very charming old English, and the bathrooms are lovely and modern. My sons enjoyed the workout room as‚Ä¶"
November 2013,Perfect yet again,"I've lost count of the number of times we have stayed here. And it's always a total delight.  The rooms are comfy and stylish.  The public areas of the hotel are welcoming and invite you to linger.  The staff are all, and I mean all, polite, friendly, attentive and excellent at what they do.  I can recommend the spicey Bloody Mary's in the bar, served with amazing yummy nibbles.  The only negative point is my own fault - one night was not enough! I need to stay longer."
June 2014,Possibly one of the best hotels in the UK? Even the world?,"As a frequent traveller to London, I've stayed in numerous hotels - from low budget to supposedly luxury. I actually booked the Milestone almost by mistake, as I'd left it too late and couldn't find anywhere else nearby. From the moment I arrived I was absolutely blown away - by the service and the quality of the entire place. It's like no hotel I've ever stayed in... It was clear we had arrived somewhere special when - at nearly 11pm, when tired and weary from a long journey, a man knocked on my room door dressed in a pristine white suit, brandishing a complimentary glass of champagne to welcome me. On my bed was a 'pillow menu' listing about 15 different types of pillow that I could request for the bed!  Every last detail of the room was sheer luxury, from the hand-written‚Ä¶"
May 2014,Felt Like Royalty,"This Hotel was amazing!! It's a boutique hotel, so remember that when you visit. You wont get a commercial hotel feel at all. Everything is vintage to the hotels history, and the coolest thing is that all the rooms are decorated differently. We stayed in the Kensington Garden Suite, which had a living room downstairs with a very comfortable pull out couch, and a Beautiful master suite upstairs. The bathroom was so luxurious with very nice big bottles of shampoo, conditioner, bubble bath, and lotion. Elegant Bath shower combo with Gold fixtures. The bathroom even had a bidet! Being in our 20's we spent a lot of time getting ready to go out on the town. The bathroom comfortably fit two us in their at a time and there was also a vanity and mirror in the bedroom. Just remember to‚Ä¶"
April 2014,nice,"This hotel is just great! Small, stylish, very nicely maintained and furnished and perfectly located in the heart of London. All the rooms are different and the bar at the ground floor has a very charming bar man offering the ""best martinis in town"". The staff is very helpful and the rooms are just perfect. Nothing to complain about"
May 2014,"""Brilliant Stay!""","I came here with my friend.When we arrived we were welcomed by a friendly doorman.All the staff at the Milestone hotel made us feel very welcome.We stayed for a night and woke up and headed downstairs to breakfast it was delightful,we had a full English and were rather full after the delicious breakfast because we couldn't get enough of it.I would advise you to come and stay at the fantastic Milestone hotel.We would defiantly stay here again!!"
April 2014,"Classic, cozy and compact!",I booked the Romantic option: and was it romantic: xxx! Excellent position across from the Kensington Palace Gardens makes for relaxed strolling. Efficient reception and very professional service all round. Attention to detail in the rooms all add up to a great stay: home away from home. The Orangerie is pleasant for a light lunch and the bar is very welcoming with live music in the Library in the evening. Close enough to the Royal Albert Hall to stroll back after a performace. 
May 2014,Lovely stay," I've had the pleasure of staying recently at two of the 4 star red carnation hotels (Montague and Rubens) and so was really looking forward to the 5 star Milestone hotel.  The welcome is warm and friendly but surprisingly my room wasn't ready so it was off to the bar to wait with a complimentary drink.  The bar is great, Markus is very knowledgeable and mixes a mean margarita and although the wait was long it wasn't unpleasant. Unfortunately a couple of the hotel management were having a meeting in the bar and it would have been better it this had taken place in an office ( I really wasn't interested in the gentleman bemoaning the rates at the Rubens).  Dinner was fabulous but very expensive. I spoiled myself with the wagyu beef fillet which was great and the wine‚Ä¶"
April 2014,Excellent Stay,"Had a wonderful 5 night stay at the Milestone. The location was convenient and accessible to all the sights. Having the park across the street is so nice. I walked through it almost everyday. The staff was warm, friendly, and so helpful. We loved the turn down service in the evening. I have never been to a hotel with such exceptional service. This hotel is truly worth every penny."
May 2014,one night stay,From entering through the doors of The Milestone we were cared for so well by the very professional & attentive staff. Every request was dealt with efficiently and always with a smile. In the middle of London this hotel felt like a calm oasis. The d√©cor beautifully traditional. Breakfast was ample and drinking in the bar a pleasure. We made the mistake of turning down a 'turn down' and then seeing our friends room who had. It looked magical. So fellow guests never ever refuse a 'turn down' at The Milestone !
May 2014,Exceptional in every way,"Quintessentially English hotel with Staff that are without a doubt some of the most professional, dedicated, polite and friendly hotel staff we have had the pleasure to meet.  Immediately we were at ease and relaxed.  Afternoon Tea was a delightful experience, our suite was outstanding - clean, plenty of space, beautifully dressed - and our Full English breakfast was second to none.  We will certainly be back!"
June 2013,Unsurpassable,"After a long and eventful journey, my wife and I arrived at the steps of the hotel to be greeted by a very helpful doorman. The check-in experience was something we had only ever experienced at Scottish country hotels; friendly and relaxed, but deceptively efficient. Pedro showed us around the hotel and some of its facilities before showing us to our room, and what a room! We had dinner in the restaurant on the first night and the food was first class, fresh and extremely tasty. A couple of drinks in the bar with a very attentive barman and then a perfect nights sleep.  The breakfast selection was amazing and they had my favourite Haddock and poached eggs, washed down with excellent coffee. An excellent breakfast that set us up for the day which began by walking out the front‚Ä¶"
April 2014,FOREVER,"Typical English hotel, very quaint and elegant, clean, tidy and the food was great!  The waiters are at the top of professionalism. . .  the treatment reserved for us is indescribable, just arrived we were served and revered. Top marks ..."
December 2013,Lovely,"My husband and I checked into the Milestone after spending 4 nights at the Savoy.  What a change of pace!  The Milestone was so quiet - almost a little too quiet but after 4 nights on the Strand it was wonderful to get away from that action.  We were upgraded to a very nice room overlooking Hyde Park.  We were only on the 3rd floor but the way that they have the windows insulated you can't hear the traffic on Kensington High St.  Amazing!   We didn't experience the ""incredible"" staff the way that many other reviewers experienced.  I don't know if it's because we are a younger couple (in our 30s) and it seems as though the hotel attracts older guests.  Regardless, all the doormen were fantastic.  Fran also made us feel very welcome.  And Jose at the concierge was able to find a‚Ä¶"
February 2014,Magical and forever special,"We stayed in the rooftops apartment for 10 days just after Christmas and it was so lovely it's hard to explain.All the amenities you can possibly imagine (room service,housekeeping etc) but it also felt like you were living in London with your own apartment. Staff is discreet, housekeeping staff are outstanding..I have stayed in luxury hotels in many cities in the world and have never had more congenial,welcoming staff anywhere! The breakfast is fantastic but if you have a chance they had the most fantastic warm salted caramel sauce on the rice pudding that was to die for ( am considering emailing the hotel for the recipe) .Wonderful location across from Kensington Palace,easy access to tube or buses and easy to hail a cab from wonderful doorman....without a doubt I recommend‚Ä¶"
February 2014,Excellent Afternoon Tea,"Visited on Sunday afternoon for a 70th birthday. Wonderful experience all round. Food was fresh, plentiful and good quality. Wide range of teas. Nice small intimate room with great ambience. Staff were all friendly and attentive without being over the top. Nice cocktails in the bar which was also very atmospheric. All in all a perfect afternoon."
February 2014,Lovely Hotel,"Service was spectacular...went out of their way to handle a special request, actually went out and got us a newspaper they didn't have.  Afternoon tea is simply divine...not to be missed.  Got there really early and they served us coffee and cookies while we waited but the room was finished so they brought it up there!"
February 2014,Great London Hotel!,"My daughter and I stayed at the Milestone for 5 days as we traveled in Europe.  It was a top notch hotel in every aspect.  From the doorman to the bellhop - all staff made our stay very pleasant.  When we first arrived we checked in and then we were offered a tour of the hotel and all the facilities.  No other hotel has ever done that. We were greeted personally every time by all the staff. Our room was perfect with a nice sitting area and desk and bathroom on the lower level.  Weather was a bit rainy and chilly some days so we took advantage of watching the Olympics hanging out in the room.  It was off the beaten path a little bit, but moving through the city is pretty easy.  We did a lot of walking and it was nice to see so many people enjoying Kensington Park with their‚Ä¶"
February 2014,First class,"Luxurious, quintessentially English hotel with first class, friendly service. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.Very comfortable bed with luxurious pillows. Delicious breakfast, (something we are very particular about as B&B owners!), perfectly cooked eggs and the best sausages. We also dined at Chenestons, a beautiful traditional restaurant setting; the prawn and crayfish cocktail was the most packed full of prawns I've ever seen! Wouldn't hesitate to recommend and I hope that we'll be back! Thank you."
February 2014,Afternoon tea,"If you want to have the best afternoon tea experience, there is only one place The Milestone Hotel!! Incredible service from staff, Fabrizio Russo with his little touches here and there makes it even more memorable.! A place you must visit in your lifetime."
December 2013,A jewel of a hotel,"This is the first time at a luxury 5 star hotel and being my first I had to get it right and I can safely say I have done that after detailed research. The Milestone is a fantastic hotel to stay at, I guess what set's this hotel apart from others is it's multiple teamed colourful rooms with adds true character (pictures on websites don't do any justice). The staff are very friendly and will cater to your every needs. Overall I will be back to The Milestone again."
July 2013,Historical and most elegant,"This has to be the most elegant hotel i had stayed in,we stayed as couple and everything was top notch,the best thing about the hotel is their service which exceeded my expectations,elegant rooms with superb bathrooms and one of the best bed i had ever slept on."
November 2013,Perfection,I took my parents here for dinner and spent the night in absolute luxury. Every little detail is attended to and you are made to feel so incredibly special. Fabulous hotel and wonderful spa treatments. The food was out of this world and located just opposite Kensington gardens was great to walk off the carbs. Staff are so attentive i don't wish to stay anywhere ever again as it will never match up to this wonderful hotel.
December 2013,our home away from home,"It is such a wonderful experience to return over and over again to the Milestone Hotel. Everything, from the accommodations, the staff, the decor, is first rate.The Milestone is the only place we stay in London. We have been there many times. It is wonderful to see the same managers, concierges and loyal staff who have been there for a long time. The location of the hotel could not be better. Service great. We cannot say enough wonderful things about this special hotel."
December 2013,"A fun-filled, beautiful stay","Our stay at The Milestone was by far the best hotel experience we've had in the many years that we've been visiting London.  We were in London to celebrate my husband's 40th birthday with four other couples, all of whom were completely impressed with the comfort of the rooms, the perfect location, and (most of all) the unfailingly courteous staff.  Even after a few long days of attending raucous soccer matches and over-indulging in London Pride, the staff accommodated our noisy group with humor and generosity of spirit.  This is the only Hotel we will consider for future trips to London."
December 2013,Fantastic,"Andrew and I stayed at the hotel as returning guests as it is our romantic favourite treat, and it was Andrew's late birthday present.  We had an even more wonderful experience than last time, because they upgrade to a suite, Wow what a pleasure and privilege.  All the staff were wonderful, thank you so so much..."
December 2013,Best Hotel in London,"I have traveled and stayed at many 5 Star hotels but this one is by far the gest I have ever seen. In addition, to the being beautiful, the staff is beyond anything I have ever experienced. No matter what you need, they are there with a friendly smile. The attention to detail is remarkable. We even received stockings with gifts on Christmas!!"
December 2013,Amazing charming stay,"If there was a ten in the survey I would give the staff. Olivier the server, steve the doorman or Pablo the staff that showed us around. Just the best. We really enjoyed our stay. It was terrific. They remembered us by name asked about our day and were super friendly and helpful. Not just these three but the rest of the staff as well. These were just the cherry on top. Definitely will be back"
December 2013,Divine dining experience!,"If you want to feel special and pampered at one of the best hotels in the world then you have found the one! My amazing boyfriend decided to spoil me for my birthday recently and took me to this wonderful hotel as a surprise. I honestly didn't know where I was going until I arrived!  What a fantastic surprise it was! From the doorman who assisted us out the taxi to the lovely welcome from the concierge. The special cocktails in the very traditional bar and amazing bar snack selection kept my star rating climbing but what topped off my entire experience was the incredible food and superb service in Cheneston's restaurant. As they knew I was celebrating my birthday, they had reserved us a table in a beautiful private area with the sounds of the piano drifting through. A special‚Ä¶"
December 2013,Romantic amazing dinner,We dined at the Cheneston's (Kensington in old English as we learnt from the intro to the restaurant printed on the menu) gastronomic restaurant. The excellence of the service is remarkable as is the attention to detail in the surroundings as well as the food and drinks. The food was fabulous and the atmosphere even though luxurious is so cosy it is heart warming. We were overall enchanted!
June 2013,Great Hotel-but just missed the mark,"I was attracted to staying at this hotel. It's location and its fantastic rating on Trip Advisor clinched the decision. Fresh from staying at the Mandarin Oriental in Paris, it seemed the perfect choice, living up to its high status on Trip Advisor. The hotel was extensively renovated and modernized internally after a severe fire caused extensive damage more than 10 years ago. The service staff from the receptionist to the doormen to the concierge were fabulous. Rooms were small but given much thought in their layout to maximize functionality. Bathrooms were spacious but a little cold and the shower layout could have been better as the spray volume from the fixed overhead shower was inadequate to keep a person warm while showering. Bathroom heating, or better still, underfloor‚Ä¶"
June 2013,Best Hotel In London,"Me and my boyfriend came to London to visit some friends from Brighton, we did not intend to stay, after lunch we decided to go get a hotel and stay a night,  we randomly ended up in knightsbridge after driving around a bit and parked the car and walked into the nearest hotel which was the Milestone, upon arrival our bags were taken and the door was opened for us.   we asked for a room and as we had not booked we had to wait for a room to be made for us. during this time we were escorted into the most amazing bar, it was very cosy and had an equestrian theme! we were given nibbles and a glass of champagne on the house, (the best champagne I've ever had) our bags were taken to our room and then we went up.  The room was lovely! the deco was so homely, it was extremely clean! we‚Ä¶"
November 2013,The most perfect English hotel !,"Perfect, perfect rooms, entrance hall, the staff are so friendly yet not overbearing, upon a random arrival- we hadn't even booked we just drove up to the entrance we relieved of our bags and before you know it drinking a couple of glasses of Guy Cadel champagne - one of the best tasting house bottles I've had ! Had a great dinner also , would love to come back and visit !"
August 2013,"I could live here. No, really.","This was my fourth visit to the Milestone in 15 years. I wish I could visit several times a year, but I am not called to London often enough and my bank book cannot support my penchant for this sort of luxury. My most recent stay was in mid-November, and I admit I left feeling that I could live here. Not just in London, although that appeals, too, but no: I could easily live in the elegant cocoon of the Milestone where my every want and need are anticipated and filled.  From the moment you pull up in front of the hotel, you feel welcome. The staff are friendly but quietly understated. After the butler shows you to the room, tea is offered. How very civilized on a chilly London day!  Part of the Milestone's considerable charm is that it is just quirky enough to be authentic, and‚Ä¶"
September 2013,A great place to stay,"I had an appointment in London at the end of August, so we decided to combine business with some shopping and sightseeing and stay somewhere really special. We decided to try the Milestone Hotel after seeing the excellent reviews on Trip Adviser. We were not disappointed. We were checked in by Neil, the Front of House Manager. He was friendly and efficient and quickly made us feel very welcomed. After a quick tour of the hotel, we were then shown up to our room. We stayed in the English Rose room. This room was a good size, beautifully decorated, and had glorious views over Kensington Gardens. The bathroom also had a luxurious feel and looked especially nice at night with soft lighting and candles. There were fresh flower arrangements in the bedroom and bathroom too. We also‚Ä¶"
September 2013,Expectations Met,"From the moment we arrived we were greeted like we were returning to our home. The staff of this property are both extremely friendly, yet professional. Our junior suite was spacious by London standards and was a nice mix of modern with traditional amenities. The hotel's bar was cozy and fun. We looked forward to returning for drinks at the end of each day. Breakfast and afternoon tea were outstanding. Tourist sights were easy to get to by either the Tube or the hop on/off bus tour, but we preferred actually staying in the lovely Kensington neighborhood. The Milestone Hotel was the perfect choice for our time in London and we will be back!"
September 2013,"NO REQUEST IS TOO LARGE, NO DETAIL TOO SMALL",The payoff of the hotel perfectly fits the extraordinary experience of staying at the Milestone. I absolutely loved dining at the Cheneston's and I want to thank everybody for making my staying in London simply unforgettable! I
March 2013,Service is key here,"Although the Milestone was not close to anything we were in London to see, it was a quick ""tube"" ride to anywhere we were headed.  Other than having to wait to check in, the service in this hotel was amazing.  From the concierge Jose', to the amazing bartender and including the ""always there"" Julie, the service was impeccable.  For my birthday, I came back to the room that night to find a birthday cake, rose petals on the bed and in the bathtub and lit floating candles in glass vases everywhere.  It was beautiful.  We had a great view of Kensington Park and everytime we left the property the bellman was friendly, calling us by name, and helpful. There were quite a few people staying there that make the Milestone a yearly visit. The keyword for this hotel is ""Service"""
October 2013,Just great,"This beautiful hotel in Kensington has such an excellent service. One is greeted with a personal touch and you feel very welcome. The breakfast is the best I can remember, I wish I could eat there every morning....   The bar has excellent cocktails, beware of the Vesper cocktail, It kicks like a mule...  Our room was beautiful, quiet and extremely comfortable.  The location of the hotel is very good, we took the tube every time as this was very easy to get around London."
September 2013,Fantastic,"Nothing about the hotel is worth a negative word.  Just excellent.  A little problem with the concierge advance help.  The Guidelines of Britain tour was 400 pounds and did not know the daily W. Abbey schedule so it was closed and we mostly just drove around in circles.  Guide was dry and monotone, did OK with the Changing of the Guard viewing.  Also, we paid for Big Bus tickets and they were never delivered.  Did not use them since we had to go to the Abbey the next day on our own.  Still, they might have delivered the tickets to us or at least asked about them?"
September 2013,As Good as Everyone Says,"We stayed at the Milestone in September as a celebration for my husband's birthday.  When we arrived at the hotel in our taxi, the bellman greeted us by name.   From the moment we entered the hotel, until we left, attention was given by the Milestone staff to make our stay as enjoyable as possible.  We regret that we could only stay one night.    We had the African room which was cozy, elegant and comfortable.  Perhaps it is the furnishings and lighting that make it so  extraordinary.  We have stayed in 5 star hotels before, but this one is at the top of our list.  The location is right by Kensington Gardens which is beautiful.  It is a 5 minute walk to the underground that is very easy to navigate.  If you want to splurge and stay somewhere really nice, look no further than The‚Ä¶"
September 2013,Absolutely lovely,"Booked this hotel based on tripadvisor reviews. It truly was a beautiful place to stay. The room we had was scrumptious. That added to all the little touches: hand written welcome note; cookies on arrival, chocs with turn down service; complimentary water; and so many towels and gowns we didn't know what to do with. The room was scrupulously clean. Service from all staff - impeccable. The hotel is located very close to High St Kensington tube station making it easy to get into the city but it's a ""nice"" area of London to come back to. Good shops and restaurants. We especially enjoyed being able to walk in Kensington Gardens (just across the road) after breakfast before heading out to hit the sights."
September 2013,Simply amazing,It was a real treat and a once a year splash for three nights in London recently with my partner. We chose The Milestone and we were not disappointed.  Attention to detail and all staff superbly attentive but no overkill. Special mention to Steve who is essentially the first person you meet when you pull up (in a taxi in our case). Great 'frontman' for the hotel. Very comfortable beds and suffice to say every need catered for in the well maintained rooms. Public areas a quality peaceful experience.  Thanks to all staff at The Milestone
December 2013,"Milestone Hotel,  London, England",My husband and I spent 2 nights. Best small hotel we ever stayed in. Beautiful and very comfortable.  Staff excellent gave attention to all our needs. Location is perfect for getting around London.  When they heard we were celebrating our anniversary they surprised us with a special night in our room with rose petals.  I was so surprised when we returned from a dinner out and walked into our rose covered room.  This was a truly a special gift.
December 2013,"Very cozy hotel, outstanding service","We're not usually big on boutique hotels but this one is exceptional. Service really sets them apart, and it is attentive and friendly from beginning to end. The decor is very traditionally British, but renovated and well-maintained throughout. We had been upgraded to a park view room, though the view was obscured by the lovely (from the outside) Christmas decorations. The staff is terrific, and addresses you by name very quickly. The food at Chennestons is wonderful, and there are a number of other restaurants easily accessible nearby.  If you're visiting London for the first time keep in mind that while the Milestone is convenient to Albert Hall, Kensington Gardens and Knightsbridge, it is not as walkable to the big sites in Westminster as the hotels in that Park Lane area.‚Ä¶"
November 2013,Quintessential English at its best,"We were lucky enough to have our wedding reception at the Milestone three years ago.  Last night we were even luckier to stay the night.  We had the Kensington Palace room, appropriately overlooking Kensington Gardens and onto the Palace.  The room was walled silk, thick damask type eiderdown, fluffy duvet, penhaglion toiletries, fruit and complimentary biscuits.  Knowing it was our wedding anniversary, they complemented all the above with congratulation cards, a bottle of champagne, strawberries dipped in chocolate and the final icing on the cake was returning to the room after dinner to find we had suddenly arrived in candle-land.  What seemed like hundreds of candles decorating the room, with equally hundreds of rose petals adorning the bed, and leading to the bathroom. ‚Ä¶"
November 2013,Excellent Stay,"We stayed 3 nights (3 for the price of 2) for our wedding anniversary and we were luckily upgraded to a 2-bed apartment.  We splurged and arranged for the Bentley to collect us from the airport.  Enjoyed our welcome glass of bubbles in the saddle bar and then later in the evening had dinner at their signature restaurant. It is a charming quintessential British boutique hotel and the service is very good.  Great location for the Albert Hall, Knightsbridge and Hyde Park. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
December 2013,Lives up to the hype,"My wife and I stayed at The Milestone on the last weekend of November 2013 as a celebration for her birthday. I had read so many excellent reviews beforehand I had to wonder if The Milestone was really that good. In short, yes it is. The staff and their attention to detail are really what sets this place apart. Also special touches such as a complimentary glass of champagne each on arrival and balloons and a delicious birthday cake. The final crowning glory was the afternoon tea. As usual the service was impeccable and the food superb."
November 2013,our new 'home' when in london,"my 10 year old son and i just stayed two nights at the milestone (dec 2013).  what a great experience!  from the very beginning when i first emailed the hotel to our departure, the hotel was excellent.  I've stayed in many fine hotels around europe and the u.s., the milestone is amongst the very best.  they corresponded via email before our trip to ensure that both my son and i had the things we would need; helped us to find fun and enjoyable activities while at the hotel, and made sure we had a great room and all the wonderful service.    we enjoyed walking about london and taking the tube.  after all day sight seeing, we were rather tired so we had room service.  they have good food that even my picky eater son liked - chicken sticks, french fries, and ice cream.  speaking of‚Ä¶"
November 2013,A Wonderful Time,"My wife and I joined four other couples for a three nights stay at the Milestone. We arrived at 7:00am after a cross atlantic flight to find that our room was ready; no issues with an early check in or anything like that. We had breakfast at the hotel on two occaisions and had cocktails at the Stable bar. The hotel is located just a few minutes from the Kensington High Street Tube Stop and close to many of the more popular sites in London. Everyone at the hotel was always available to answer questions and help when needed. If I had one (small) complaint, I would say that the showers are very small and don't make it easy for a 6'2 man to comfortably shower.  If and when we come back to London, we will stay at this hotel.  It really was a wonderful experience and a first class‚Ä¶"
October 2013,Exceptional!,"I've stayed in many, many hotels - but I've never seen the attention to detail and care shown by the staff and management of The Milestone. The rooms are beautifully decorated, there are dozens of thoughtful little extras that the hotel does for the guests. The restaurant is superb and the gym and pool and more than adequate. I happily recommend The Milestone as one of the best (if not THE best) hotels I've ever stayed at."
September 2013,Lovely Mother-Daughter Weekend,"I LOVED the Milestone Hotel. It is right in Chelsea across from Kensington Palace. I have been to London many times and therefore did not need to be in the hub of London, making this a wonderful, quiet location. It is still within walking distance of so much, and is really quite peaceful. The hotel itself is clean, and the decor is classically British. I felt like a queen at the hotel. The rooms were beautiful, and the bathroom was fantastic. It was such  lovely atmosphere for a mother daughter weekend getaway.   The breakfast in the morning was delicious. The room it is in is beautiful as well. Overall, I think the grand decor of the hotel completely won me over."
September 2013,Best Afternoon Tea Period!,"If you're looking for a very special experience, look no further. We booked in advance and told them we were veggies and they catered specially for us. Chocolate scones and some of the most incredible cucumber sarnies I've ever had. Yum yum yum!"
September 2013,Great!!!!,"I was very astounded by the level of service in which the staff provides first to state, I do not usually write reviews but I definitely had to make a contribution here. I love love this hotel and will be back guaranteed. I actually live in London so I had no need to stay here but some friends decided to do something different and I joined them and I must say. It was worth it!"
September 2013,A Dream by Chance,"To celebrate a special birthday for my wife. Margaret I  decided to visit London and realy spoil her with two close friends we arrived at, unkown to us, AND BY SHEER CHANCE The Milestone in Kensington. The dream began from the moment the taxi arrived . Greeted by a cheerful ,helpful smartly dressed commissionaire who really set the standard. an attractive most obliging receptionist, Georgia, welcome drinks, light lunch, all. it seemed ,in a twinkling of an eye. Extremely high standard rooms, mouthwatering menu's with food served fit for a Queen.Even the house ladies said a cheerful hello in answering queries especially one lady from Columbia, so polite and happy to help juist all charming. Heading it all from arrival to departure was Manager Neil and his night staff Manager. A‚Ä¶"
December 2012,Beautiful boutique hotel with best staff on the planet,"My husband and I spent 4 nights here on a recent trip to London. The desk staff and concierges are first rate. However, the best doorman on the planet is a pleasant fellow named Patricio who always greeted us with a smile and friendly comment. We also enjoyed chatting with Anjia, the young woman from Poland, who tended bar and remembered our favorite drinks each night. The hotel upgraded us to the Harlequin Suite which was simply beautiful. Breakfast was bountiful. We thoroughly enjoyed afternoon tea which was substantial enough to substitute for dinner. Service during tea was a bit sloppy and slow but no big deal. Ultimately, this is a top of the line place with good service and a great location."
September 2013,Perfect London Christmas,"My wife and two teenage children stayed for a week over Christmas in 2012. We had never travelled to London so this was our first experience. First, the GM Andrew Pike and his entire staff are among the finest people we've met traveling. They made everything easy for us, but treated us like friends & family, not visitors. Their attention to detail was impeccable, from the decorated Christmas tree in our kids adjoining room, to stockings filled with gifts and breakfast on Christmas morning. I have to say that my wife and I were blown away at their hospitality. The location is perfect - right across from Kensington Palace in the neighborhood of Kensington, so you feel like a local more than a tourist. Several train stations are nearby walks, as well as a dozen restaurants, a Whole‚Ä¶"
March 2013,Romance!,"My husband and I stayed at the Milestone for our Wedding Anniversary and had the ""Romance Package"".  We were not disappointed, from the welcome to the check out we were made to feel special.  Our room was so well equipped with a lovely view, all the staff were helpful and friendly.  Would we stay again - in a heartbeat!"
September 2013,Great Hotel,"Loved my stay at this hotel, everything was to an extremely high standard and I can't wait to make my next booking. The rooms are just perfect and although I was in and out on business throughout my stay I couldn't wait to get back each time i left."
September 2013,As Good As Advertised,"My wife and I just stayed at the Milestone for the first time. It was an incredible experience from the moment we checked in. The staff is exceptional, and our stay couldn't have been better. This is a special place!"
September 2013,Milestone Heaven,"This is by far one of the best small hotels that we have ever visited.  From the moment you check-in you are treated as a special guest.  We were given a tour of the facilities, taken to the room and shortly thereafter a welcome drink arrived.  A fruit platter was already in the room and all items requested prior to arrival (i.e.a pants press) were waiting.  We were on the breakfast plan and the selections left nothing to be desired.  We took advantage of the dinner option for each two nights of your stay and were allowed to utilize a credit of 25 pounds per person off the regular menu instead of using the fixed menu.  The food was fabulous!  Now a few words about the staff.  There is nothing that you want that they cannot handle.  From the front desk through the concierge,‚Ä¶"
June 2013,A very special hotel,"This was our third stay at the Milestone this year - following a recommendation by a friend when we were going to an event at the Royal Albert Hall in March.  We no longer wait for an excuse to stay here, such as going to an event in London - staying at the Milestone is an event in itself.  There are so many things to praise at this hotel that it's difficult to know where to start.  The rooms are beautifully decorated and furnished, as well as being so comfortable you don't want to leave them.  The breakfast is freshly cooked to order (my husband hates buffets) and most definitely worth the short wait.  Bathrooms have everything you could possibly want, including loads of unbelievably fluffy, soft towels, high quality Penhaligon toiletries and the best make up/shaving mirror I‚Ä¶"
July 2013,Terrific hotel experience,"We asked for rooms on an upper floor and away from ""the lift."" Our rooms were well-appointed and very quiet- we slept soundly every night. The hotel demonstrated a keen attention to detail in every respect. From the friendly greetings of the staff each morning, to the treats placed on our beds at night, we always felt welcome. The hotel itself is beautiful and historic, and has a lovely view of Kensington Gardens."
August 2013,An Ideal Home away from Home,"The Milestone Hotel is excellent in providing warm service and comfortable surrounds, leaving you wishing it was your home away from home. It feels distinctively British throughout the hotel, which is appropriate when you're staying in the heart of London.   Being centrally located, you get the best of everything during your stay. Step out and look ahead to see the impressive Kensington Gardens, look to the left to find shops accompanied by the hustle and bustle, and look to the right to spot the quieter part of town. It's a good area, and you will feel at ease walking around it.   You might notice a few complaints here about the size of the rooms, but we felt it was adequate given the context of staying in a heritage building in the city. After all, you wouldn't complain about‚Ä¶"
August 2013,Quality of visit,our eigth visit One. Of the best hotels we have stayed in The staff are always on hand to help and advise but never intrusive. The rooms are clean and comfortable with everything available.The food is of the  highest standard and again we really enjoyed our stay and are already looking forward to our next visit.
May 2013,Fantastic birthday stay,"This hotel couldn't have been more perfect for celebrating my 40th birthday with my husband. We received a very friendly welcome upon arrival, our room -The Saville Row - was luxurious and comfortable, in particular the huge firm bed, the lovely window seats with a view over Kensington Gardens and the powerful ceiling shower. Later on we visited the stylish and relaxing hotel bar, where we had our welcome courtesy drinks, served by Dickson, the very friendly head barman.  After a great sleep, we were served a scrumptious breakfast, great menu and continental choice. All in all an excellent stay, highly recommend for a special occasion or frequent travelers wanting a home from home experience."
May 2013,Truly delightful,"If you have the opportunity, stay at the Milestone. We stayed there for a few days after a business trip to attend the Chelsea Flower show. The rooms delightful, the staff are helpful and genuine, the beds comfortable, the plumbing splendid, the food good, and the afternoon tea wicked! Loved the little Sherlock Holmes book on the bed the first night. Almost hated to go exploring in London. Thank you to all the staff for your obessional attention to detail."
August 2013,Superb Hotel,"The moment you enter The Milestone Hotel, the entire staff starts pampering you. They are all so friendly and hospitable, so this really is the home from home. Every detail is important. The rooms are spotless, there is fresh fruit at the table in the sitting area and before you realize that you will sleep like royalty, they bring up your welcome drink. The food is delicious and the drinks are of very high quality. Since we discovered this paradise on earth, we never stayed at another hotel in London..... Berthel ter Steege and Henk Buss, Haarlem, The Netherlands."
August 2013,Loved Every Minute of Our Stay!!,"I have stayed in many beautiful hotels around the world, but I have to say without a doubt, the Milestone is one of my favorites! Charming, cozy, elegant and unique are the first words that come to mind when remembering my stay there. The staff was friendly and helpful with our every need, from organizing guided tours to acquiring the tickets for the best shows at night. The restaurant was very good and the most impressive thing of all (for me) was afternoon tea. I had mentioned that my daughter was gluten intolerant and as they presented us a gorgeous tower of pastries and sweets to enjoy with our tea, they brought a second tower out that they made specially for her of gluten free sweets. The look on her face was priceless for me and it is this kind of attention to detail that‚Ä¶"
July 2013,Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon tea at the Milestone was an experience I won't ever forget! From the moment we stepped out of our taxi, to the moment we left the hotel, the service and attention we received was bar none. Every member of staff was helpful and kind.  My friend & I had our two small babies with us and we were all welcomed and helped in & out with our buggies. One member of staff brought me to the spa to change my baby. We were made to feel so welcome and so well looked after.  The tea itself was fantastic, the choices of pastries and sandwiches were so delicious and so were the scones. It was a highlight of my visit to London & I cannot praise the hotel & staff enough."
June 2013,They go the extra mile on service,"We stayed here following the excellent reviews on TA and were prepared to be disappointed.  We were not. In this hotel, service is almost an obsession. We tested it in many ways from changing one of the chairs in the room to helping us cope with moving an electric mobility cart in and out of the hotel. Everything was done effortlessly and with extreme professionalism. The room we were in was not large but it was well laid out.   The fitness room was excellent and they have even managed to get a lap pool into the basement.    Wifi is free and fast although this needed codes on every use which became a small irritant (and something I am sure they will change).   On reviewer called this the best hotel in the world bar none. We have great difficulty refuting this and if you want to‚Ä¶"
June 2013,"THE BEST HOTEL IN THE WORLD, BAR NONE!","The most incredible, fabulous, friendly and home from home accommodation anywhere in the world. Having looked on Tripadvisor for a quality hotel in the Kensington area, I noted how well the reviews and ratings were for The Milestone Hotel so I called them up. From the get-go the lady in reservations was so attentive to my enquiry, promising me an unbelievable experience at The Milestone. She was not wrong, from the moment my Wife and I were greeted by the tall and charming doorman, onto reception, then into our fabulous suite, the Hotel and staff were like nothing we've ever experienced ever before. To write down everything that occurred would take far too long and would never be able to describe how incredible our stay was at this fine establishment. The opulence, attention to‚Ä¶"
February 2013,one of the best period hotels of london,"great location, perfect service, excellent accommodation. concierge is on the most friendly and knowledgeable persons in any hotel i have stayed in london, great access to shopping, theatre and transport as well as sight seeing.   the restaurant can do with more friendly staff, as well as a wider selection of food menu options. recommend that you eat out of the hotel.   the spa is also wonderful as is the swimming pool."
July 2013,Delightful place for a milestone birthday.,"Time seems to have gotten away from me, as it's been some months since my friend and I stayed at The Milestone. I was celebrating a ""big"" birthday and we had spent several days in Paris and had stayed at another London hotel before arriving at The Milestone. Check-in was welcoming and efficient and we were quickly shown to our room. When I expressed dissatisfaction with the size of the room, we were just as quickly taken back to reception and in minutes were given a more spacious, and I suspect upgraded, room. Everything we needed was provided in the room or brought to us upon request. There was even a surprise birthday cake waiting for us one evening. As apart of a promotional offer, we were given dinner at Cheneston's, the hotel's restaurant and found the food to be delicious.‚Ä¶"
March 2013,Lived up to High Expectations,"I stayed at the Milestone largely because of the great reviews on Tripadvisor.  It definitely lived up to the expectations.  I was greeted by one of the bellman (believe his name was Fran) as soon as I stepped out of the cab, he walked me to the front desk where I checked in.  He then gave me a quick tour of the hotel and then showed me to my room.   My hotel room (believe it was called the Matisse Studio), was very well appointed.    I would definitely recommend having drinks in the lounge at some point.  The bartender, Dickson, does a great job.  Both his drinks and his conversation were excellent.  The food was superb.  I had dinner there one day with a friend from London.  We were a little nervous because we were the only people in the restaurant (it was a Sunday night), but‚Ä¶"
June 2013,Best Afternoon Tea,"Hotel is an old English building that has been renovated. You can have  afternoon tea in one of the salons and seat there to talk. Amazing value  extremely cosy place.  Its my best afternoon tea place in London.  There is also beautiful cocktail bar.  Location is convenient in the center of London and in front of Kensington parl / palace. It is easy to find place to park vehicle nearby and bus to go to Piccadilly.  Excellent staff and service.  If you are a person that does not like something private, this is the place."
June 2013,A Royal Experience,This was our first time at The Milestone but it certainly won't be our last.  From the moment you walk up the steps you are treated like Royalty.  The staff is professional and extremely helpful.  Our room was quite large and beautifully decorated.  The bathroom was amazing and I‚Äôve never seen so many towels!!!   Each time we walked thru the lobby we were asked if we needed anything before we had to ask.  What terrific service.  We thoroughly enjoyed the food & the intimate living room live with a piano player.  We had theater tickets our first night so we needed to eat early.  The hotel arranged for the chef to open the dining room early to accommodate our time schedule & our dinner was delicious and served in a timely manner so we were right on time for our show.  Anyone‚Ä¶
June 2013,outstanding,"we only stayed for one night for my husbands birthday and I can honestly say we have never been so well looked after and thoroughly spoilt.the staff are so friendly but not too familiar.they looked after us with genuine care.the breakfast was also lovely as was the birthday cake the bought up to our room as a surprise.we can't wait to go again,it will just take me another year to save up.thankyou milestone"
June 2013,Wonderful experience,"This was the finest hotel I'd ever stayed at. The building and rooms were magnificent, the position excellent, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly. The breakfast dining room was particularly lovely and elegant."
June 2013,My family of 4 were treated like royalty!,"Wow, where to begin? My husband stays in London for business fairly regularly, so this time we decided to tag along with our 12 and almost 11 year old kids. As world travelers themselves, they cannot stop raving about the milestone! We had adjoining rooms that seemed tailor made for us, and we loved the personalized attention to details both big and small. For example, our wonderful waitress at breakfast named Kristina remembered our breakfast favorites from each day, and this not only made ordering easy, but thrilled the kids and made them feel special. Needless to say, she got a big American hug from us all when we left! The afternoon tea was a highlight, and when we were too stuffed to finish all of the goodies, a delicious platter of scones showed up a while later in our‚Ä¶"
June 2013,Mostly great!,"The Milestone Hotel is in a great location, we really found it super easy to get about London. Many attractions are within walking distance and the tube stop is just around the corner (High Street Kensington). We found our room to be a bit on the small side, and it was decorated in sort of a Moroccan/Modern theme, which was a bit odd considering we were hoping for that quintessential ""English"" feel that carries throughout the rest of the hotel, but the room was nice and clean nonetheless. The only issue was the shower drain was a bit clogged (water would build up in the tub while taking a shower which is always a bit annoying). The complementary drink and snack were a warm welcome, especially after 18 hours of travel time. We also enjoyed dining in the restaurant for breakfast‚Ä¶"
June 2013,"Ambience, location, service culture - OUTSTANDING!","So much has been written about The Milestone before our stay, I am not sure what we can add except to echo those who loved this gem of a hotel. We arrived very late on Sunday night, but we were greeted warmly, thoroughly debriefed on the hotel and its amenities, given a brief tour and escorted to our room. Coffee service was delivered the next morning at exactly the time ordered. We were on our honeymoon and the staff had clearly been briefed beforehand as the offers of congratulations came from everyone. When we came back to the room on our second night, the room was lit with candles, and rose petals were strewn (more like perfectly placed!) throughout the room, bath, bed, night stands, etc. Perfectly romantic and a lovely personal touch. We were simply enchanted by our‚Ä¶"
June 2013,Superb accommodations and service,"I was at the Milestone Hotel for 2 nights as a layover. It is a wonderful boutique hotel where no detail is too small or request too large.  My room was very comfortable with every amenity I needed, room service for breakfast and the hotel restaurant were both outstanding. Afternoon tea was classic English and wonderful. The hotel is directly across the street from Hyde Park, a short walk to a London Underground station, and surrounded by dozens of great restaurants.  Key features for me in a hotel are lots of hot water, good water pressure, and reliable internet.  The Milestone gets an A+ on all areas.  The best feature of the Milestone Hotel is how wonderful and accommodating the staff is from the doorman to the front desk, the waiters and anyone I came in contact with.  The‚Ä¶"
March 2013,I'll go there as long...,"It is not to room 409,this terrible room doesn't open the windows and air condition alone is suffocating.I love everything about the Milestone and I went back after traveling through the continent and than went to a much nicer room.if you like tea, the breakfast tea is the best in England.Staff couldn't be better.This was my 4th stay so I hope going back"
March 2013,Absolutely wonderful stay!,"The Milestone will without a doubt rank in the top five hotels I have had the pleasure of staying with.  My wife and I stayed for 9 nights and each of them was a above our expectations.  We were visiting our adult daughter in London and the hotel was very accommodating in allowing us to have her over night with us several nights.  Of course there was an extra fee, but it included a very nice hot or continental breakfast.  We also had the pleasure of having our very first English tea!  The hotel presents an excellent tea experience.  We opted for the champagne tea and was very impressed!  The presentation and service were impeccable and the food items were excellent! The tea was of course awesome!  The bar areas were very nice as well. A nice place to sip a local ale.  The‚Ä¶"
March 2013,A wonderful hotel and restaurant,"It was my birthday and my family took us for a Champagne High Tea at this absolutely lovely hotel.  The Staff were charming and impeccable and the service was fautless,  Little wonder that it rates as a Member of the Leading Small Hotels of the World!!  The dining room looked really wonderful, although we did not have dinner there ourselves (had far too much to eat at tea time!) Elegance like this does not come cheap, but an excellent choice for a very special occasion."
March 2013,Hotel Perfection!,"If you are looking for the most beautiful, accommodating, special, romantic, and charming hotel in London - please look no further than the Milestone. My husband and I visited for a vacation for 3 nights and were absolutely blown away by every detail. We've stayed in many 5 star resort properties, and the Milestone has now raised the bar.   First, the staff. From the moment we arrived, the staff went ABOVE & BEYOND to do everything imaginable to make our stay 5 stars. We were greeted by name from the moment we stepped out of the taxi...like magic! We were greeted by our butler after check-in and every single staff member greeted us by name as we toured the hotel's charming facilities. Our room, the Viscount Suite, was huge! With views of Kensington Palace, a huge comfy bed, and‚Ä¶"
March 2013,My Thesaurus is inadequate,"Truly, one can hardly find enough superlatives to describe the experience of a stay at The Milestone.  We are no strangers to hotels in the Red Carnation Group, but we particularly enjoyed our first stay here in March.  The staff, without exception, were extremely attentive, without being over-solicitous; and it is hard to find fault with the welcome, the radical cleanliness, comfort or the cuisine. The quality of the food was of a very high standard.  The only fault we could find...and we are being a bit pedantic.... was that the early morning tea was only lukewarm.  I suspect it was made with water off the boil, as so often dismally practised on the Continent. We were particularly taken with the attention to detail throughout, including the thoughtful individual books and‚Ä¶"
March 2013,A stylish home from home,"As a writer, I've been lucky enough to travel the world and stay at some of the best hotels - and the worst. This isn't just one of the best. I've actually come to the conclusion that the Milestone is THE best. A happy, welcoming staff combined with beautiful decor make this a peaceful and stylish retreat from London's hussle and bussle. It actually feels like home, only a little more luxurious."
February 2013,Faultless service from start to finish,"This was a specially arranged overnight stay (with dinner) for a birthday treat.  From the moment we walked through the door, we were made to feel special.  The service was impeccable. In the rooms, the hotel has thought of everything that their guests might need and more. Dinner at Cheneston's, the hotel's restaurant, was a delight as was breakfast the following morning. Having worked in the travel industry for over 20 years, I can honestly say that no hotel in this country has come close to delivering the service that we received at The Milestone Hotel. Thank you."
October 2012,"""Out of This World Experience""","We stayed at the Milestone in London for only one night in February before flying out on holiday the next day.  We have never stayed in a 5 Star Boutique Hotel before but what a magnificent experience it was.  Accomodation - amazing, staff - amazing, warmth & friendlyness - amazing!  For sheer luxury and comfort this has to be one of the best Hotels anywhere.  We cannot praise the staff enough for the way that they looked after us especially on the eve of our holiday abroad. Thank you Milestone and I'm sure we shall return, soon!  (If anyone is interested in staying then please contact the lovely Georgia at the hotel)."
March 2013,excellent service,"This beautiful hotel in Kensington is a part of the Red Carnation family of fine hotels. The standards of the rooms are excellent; clean, well presented and comfortable. The staff are very friendly and professional."
March 2013,Best hotel,"Difficult to express the many components that go into excellent service.  The Milestone seems to encompass all of them - kind, knowledgeable, friendly, helpful staff; exceedingly good wine; very fine food; spotlessly clean and very well appointed rooms. We hope to return soon.  It is hard to imagine better service any place.  The Ritz could take a lesson.  This beautiful hotel in Kensington is a part of the Red Carnation family of fine hotels.  We will now attempt to find them wherever we go.  We feel indebted to the staff at the Milestone for making our week so lovely. Gail Hornsby"
December 2012,The Milestone experience,"We recently renewed our acquaintance with the Milestone and were delighted to see that it was every bit as good as we remembered.  The standards of the rooms are excellent - clean, well presented and comfortable.  The staff are very friendly and professional.  Our dining experience was good, and the ambiance of the dining room and the other public rooms is good.  We will certainly want to repeat our experience when we can."
April 2013,Wonderful British style hotel,"This is my favourite hotel in London. Service is excellent, from reception to waiters, everyone extremely helpful with a smile on the face.  Decoration is old style British, very well taken care of and rooms are extremely comfortable.  Location is great by Hyde Park and Kensington, 5 min walk to the Royal Albert Hall and close to tube stations and buses.  Afternoon tea is amazing."
April 2013,The Best,"I was fortunate enough to spend one night in this fabulous hotel,  The staff, food, service and Afternoon Tea were exceptional.  The Kensington location is perfect for shopping and site seeing.  Can you give 6 stars?"
March 2013,My 4th stay and looking forward to a 5th,"Anyone that read my last review on this hotel may have noticed there were some blips in the service. Well everyone is entitled to some blips so my self and friend booked another stay as its such a beautiful hotel. Are we glad we did. on arrival we were shown to our room 509 which was lovely with views over the park. Everything was perfect they even had the pillows we requested on our last stay. Fruit platter and champagne welcome mmmm.  We had a cocktail in the bar which Markus made especially for us and canapes, both were excellent. We opted for breakfast in the room the first morning and had the smoked haddock with poached eggs, delicious.  After going out for a walk we asked Pedro who was front of house if he could show us some of the other rooms and everyone he showed us was‚Ä¶"
February 2013,5 STARS NOT ENOUGH!,"We recently spent three nights in London at the Milestone at the onset of a 2 week trip through England. We stayed in all top rated 5 star hotels and our favorite was the Milestone. They all had exceptional rooms and food, but the service and attention the Milestone gives to their customers was exceptional with none of the snobbishness other Hotels carried themselves with! They all called us by our names and correct title. They promptly arranged excellent massages for my wife & I after spending 13 hours getting there. Their dining experience was also exceptional, and reasonably priced. Best food we had in London. Location was terrific right across from Kennsington Palace & Gardens, and within walking distance of many top London sites including Harrods. If you want a 5 plus star‚Ä¶"
March 2013,My favourite Hotel in London,"I come to London every year on business and have found the Milestone Hotel to be by far the most welcoming and comfortable place to stay. The rooms are spotless and the staff make every effort to make you feel welcome. The hotel has individual air con in the room so one can get warm quickly if the weather is cold! The concierge team are extremely helpful and can almost always offer sound advice.Room service is prompt and the food choices are exceptional. I would recommend this hotel to any friend and especially for a lady travelling alone, because I feel that it is a safe and secure environment in which to stay."
February 2013,Simply brilliant!!,"We stayed at the Milestone, having been suggested to do so by a fellow Brit. It's an ideal location directly across from Kensington Palace, the nicest Whole Foods market, and many different fashion shops. Plus the Tube & the bus stops are so close by! All of these being important factors with 3 teenage girls!  We were on spring break visiting our eldest daughter who is studying abroad. Being a family of five, we stayed in one of their apartments with 2 bedrooms & 2-1/2 baths. It also had a kitchen, breakfast room and living room. The apartment included breakfast every morning downstairs in the beautiful restaurant with a fireplace. The food was delicious and the service impeccable!. We found the food over all excellent as we had high tea upon our arrival, as well as room service‚Ä¶"
April 2013,Six star service,"I've been meaning to write this review but have been so busy so finally here it is... I stayed at this hotel in February and what can I say a sanctuary in the heart of London.  The staff that I encountered were more than first class and I kept a note of all their names here goes, there was Georgia at reception with her bright and warm smile engaging, caring personality who couldn't do enough for me!!  Fran the butler with his funny Irish charm so helpful what a treat, a wonderful chap called  Fabrizo in the restaurant, gorgeous Steve at the door (got to hang on to this one) amazingly polite and engaging, lovely Silvie on the telephones whenever I didn't get through she would sort it out for me, I could go on Florent in the restaurant , Marcus at the bar was great. This was truly‚Ä¶"
March 2013,Excellent,My husband was on business and I tagged along.  Typically we stay at Brown's which is another boutique hotel.  I have to say this is a much better hotel.  The staff is friendly and efficient. The company itself really pays attention to detail. The food is good too. We stayed in the safari suite which was beautiful.  The weather wasn't great but it made coming back to the hotel better.
October 2012,My luxury home in London,I stayed here for my birthday with my family and it was a magical experience. As soon as we arrived our cases were brought in by the butler and we were greeted and went to reception. We checked in and the butler took us to our room. The room was spacious and luxurious with a balcony with a great view. It was my birthday and on arrival I had a cake waiting in my room and a card from the milestone staff wishing me happy birthday! The location was perfect near the centre however quiet in a picturesque location. The pool was a great refreshing finish to a long day in London however the hotel is so good you could stay in the hotel all week! We wanted to have afternoon tea however they were full to capacity but still managed to squeeze us in. The afternoon tea must be tried as it is‚Ä¶
January 2013,Most amazing hotel,"This is by far, the most amazing hotel i've ever stayed in.  I stayed in the Regency suite, which had nice views of the park. The bath in the middle of the room was a nice touch, as was the jar full of jelly beans. Penhaligons toiletries are used in the rooms and I'm now a huge fan of their products. Everything was perfect. I cant recommend it enough. Very good location in High street Kensington and excellent service."
May 2012,Brilliant!!!,"Upon checking in this perfectly British ""boutique"" hotel we were treated like royalty. The entire staff at the hotel were amazing and extremely hospitable.  The hotel bar is a fantastic place to have a cocktail prior to venturing out for the evening and when we returned our bartender welcomed us back by our names. This bar was a fantastic place to relax and talk with friends.  The dining room was elegant and the breakfast was superb. Although I did not opt for the healthier options - the waffle was a slice of heaven - a little bit like dessert for breakfast.  The room was perfect and the artwork on the wall was superb.  After forgetting to take off the do not disturb sign - so housekeeping did not clean our room while we were gone - we were greeted with a note that stated‚Ä¶"
January 2013,Great experience at Milestone Hotel!,"My wife and I stayed at the Milestone hotel for my 30th birthday.  From the moment we checked in until our departure the next afternoon, we were overwhelmed by the superb service from the staff at the hotel.    Upon check in, two managers welcomed me, wished me a happy birthday and upgraded our room from a standard category to one of their themed suites free of charge.  The decor in the room was a bit flamboyant but tastefully done - it was an homage to the late French entertainer Mistinguett who was once the highest paid actress/singer in her days.  The doorman at the hotel told me he wished he had tickets for the concert as well - since he was a big fan of Mark Knopfler also.  Nonetheless he wished me a great evening and asked me all about it on my return after the concert had‚Ä¶"
January 2013,It's the people who make it special,"My wife and I stay at the Milestone whenever we're in London. Having stayed at ""cheaper"" hotels in the Kensington area, we would walk by the Milestone and we'd always talk about ""someday, we're going to stay there.""  We finally did and never looked back.  The location of the hotel is perfect, close to restaurants of every type and price, just a couple of blocks from the High Street Kensington tube station, with shopping that ranges from food shops, higher-end chains to unique boutiques and antique shops.  The staff at the Milestone are the secret to its perfection, always searching for ways to improve their service. Yes, it's a most charming, intimate hotel, very quiet, warm and inviting. The hotel offers rooms you won't find elsewhere in London, each unique, beautiful,‚Ä¶"
February 2012,Favorite Hotel,The charm of the building is complemented by the competence and courtesy of the staff.  We spent a week that was both enjoyable and provied many opportunities for appreciating the best of British hospitality.
September 2012,Luxury at it's best,"I stayed at The Milestone Hotel just for one night. And i was very impressed. I have been working in luxury hotels for many years and generally know what to expect, but The Milestone Hotel absolutely exceeded my expectations.  First just when you walk in to the hotel, it seems you have entered a peaceful oasis, it was the first wow factor. It does not feel At all that the hotel is located on one of the busiest west London streets! I like small, intimate boutique hotels and Milestone thicks all boxes. I stayed in one of the studio suites with a stunning view over Kensington Gardens! Room was beautifully decorated, i especially liked the bathroom. It was good size and absolute luxury.  All in all can' t say enough about this amazing hotel they deserve to be Nr.1 on Tripadvisor!"
February 2012,The Milestone is doing everything right,"I was delighted to see The Milestone's recent inclusion in Tripadvisor's top 25 hotels in the world. From our experience, this beautiful boutique hotel deserves all the accolades it is getting. My husband and I, and two small dogs, stayed at the Milestone in September during our relocation to London. We were charmed from the outset, and every aspect of the hotel -- the cozy, comfortable bar, the gracious reception and dining rooms, the attentive service, and signature room details, only enhanced our sense of being ""home.""  Since then, we've stayed at two other Red Carnation properties, the Summer Lodge, and the Old Government House on Guernsey: both are superb.  Not many hotels make you feel this at ease, and eager to return, as the Milestone does."
November 2012,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here a couple of years ago for a few days.It was a lovely hotel,nice and small and friendly. Very expensive though.It was in a nice spot near the park.the service could not be faulted,but the room was very small with not a good outlook."
January 2013,Lovely British and top class in all performance.,The Milestone has  no tolerance making  ANY errors. They have excellent service and very friendly reception. Food and wine together with breakfast and don't forget the bar - high class! But nothing compared with the beds!! You will never get out of it lit's a lovely sleeping!
November 2012,Wonderful Experience,"The Milestone is the perfect blend of old English atmosphere with the modern amenities. The staff makes you  experience truly great service. Visited the promenade for afternoon tea, which was a real treat. The best afternoon tea ever. If your looking for 100% service then this is the place. Luxurious furnishings and attentive staff make a weekend stay feel unforgettable.  The rooms are so comfortable and the hotel smells of fresh flowers with the hint of polished wood."
November 2012,Great Hotel except the restaurant,"The Milestone Hotel is a little gem in Kensington, service is warm and personal, public areas are full of character and charm (specially the polo bar and the afternoon tea living room); and rooms are adequate.  Location is great right on Kensington Court and in front of kensington palace and gardens.  Our stay was full of nice little details from the staff, they make you feel at home and tend to your every need with a smile. would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants great attention to detail.  My only complaint is the service at the restaurant, for breakfast we had a couple of bad experiences with extremely slow service as well as the waiters giving tables to other guests that had come in after we were already waiting for a table of the same size. We finally gave up and‚Ä¶"
October 2012,Once in a lifetime,"My husband and I and a friend stayed for 10 days in a two bedroom apartment at The Milestone in November/December.   We enjoy the 'good things in life', but this far surpassed that. From the wonderful driver who picked us up at the airport, the several pleasant and friendly doormen, the happy and cheerful concierges, to Fran, the butler, who gave new meaning to the well deserved word 'awesome',  an overused word which I would normally try to avoid at all costs - they made our stay a memorable one which probably won't be repeated again soon.     The apartment was resplendent with beautiful furniture, opulent draperies and bedding, beautiful bath amenities, well appointed kitchen - well, I could go on and on.   Coming home in the evenings after a full day of enjoying London,  the‚Ä¶"
December 2012,Great place to stay with family,"Great place to visit over weekend break. Nice relaxing place, great comfortable rooms and friendly staff. Children were very happy and feel that they are very welcome by staff  who was very friendly and accomodated. Enjoyed! thank you"
December 2012,Wonderful Christmas,"Stayed in one of the apartments over Christmas and also enjoyed lovely breakfasts each morning, the Christmas dinner, and a tea.  All were wonderful!  Our family loved the space and convenience, plus it was only 5 minutes walk to the Tube and Whole foods.  Many nice restaurants in walking distance, and the staff was superb at giving suggestions on where to go and eat.  We avoid the tourist traps at all costs.    Our apartment was so clean and comfortable, and the beds felt so good after a day of sightseeing. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone."
June 2012,The Milestone a hotel of charm,"I have stayed at the milestone before and the first time it was cosy and cute. My first room was a savile row design which was awesome! Different! Yet not too loud, this time we stayed at the Venetian suite and it was jut an absolute charm in Kensington.  To be honest I had different options of hotels but I wanted to stay here because the location is brilliant, it's a boutique hotel therefore you get treated like its your own home and this what I exactly wanted.  Anyway the stay was lovely, charming and nice, staff were responsive and attainable ( thank you ) What the hotel gives you is love and what it needs is a new kettle, probably a new iron and coffee+tea in the room."
November 2012,Best Night in London,"My husband and I still fondly recall our stay at The Milestone Hotel.  Our first couple of nights in the UK were spent at this lovely location and we couldn't have been happier.  It was wonderful to return every night to such a comfortable, welcoming place.  Staff members were superb.  We stayed in several other hotels during our travels and this hotel had the most genuinely amiable, efficient and knowledgeable staff.  The Milestone has excellent dining options, is located in a pleasant part of London - right across from Kensington Park, and our rooms were cozy, elegant and very well appointed.  In fact, we were so impressed with the hotel that we decided to stay there the last couple of days of our vacation.  If you would like a gracious and truly memorable stay in London I‚Ä¶"
December 2012,Absolutely wonderful (with just a few minor complaints),"The Milestone Hotel was a wonderful experience - beautifully decorated rooms with incredibly professional staff that tried to go the extra mile to make our experience special. The hotel was fairly conveniently located in High Kensington, and also fairly affordable (after discounts). I would definitely recommend this hotel for special occasions, as they definitely made ours more memorable.  +++: Service:  From the moment you check-in, the entire experience was exactly as many guests have previously espoused: incredible. From champagne and cake for the birthday celebration, to canap√©s in the evening, all staff were friendly, professional and helpful. The concierge was especially helpful with reservations and recommendations, and the doorman was delightfully cheery as always.  ‚Ä¶"
December 2012,'Unforgettable stay in London',"I was lucky enough to stay at The MIlestone a couple of weeks ago with my mum and her friend and I can honestly say it was perfect from start to finish. Such a beautiful and luxurious boutique hotel, yet refined, cosy and unpretentious. The staff were a credit to the hotel, particularly the ladies on reception and the barmen at Stables Bar. Hope to return again soon!"
November 2012,High standards...with some blips,"The hotel were very keen guests should post a review onto Tripadvisor, so here goes. At this hotel level (that see themselves as the epitome of luxury, and for which one pays accordingly) it's attention to detail that its the ultimate judge of quality.More on this later. The style is very much 'country house' with lots of dark colours, wood panelling, chintz and so on. The rooms are on the small side (two guests wanting to watch TV means one will have to sit on the bed) but are richly furnished; the bathroom is substantial and luxuriously equipped. The lobby service is very good and attentive but I have one or two minor issues with the service. As I said, it's attention to detail that's all important. It seemed the majority of the staff serving were eastern European origin and‚Ä¶"
January 2012,Excellent Stay in London,"I spent a few nights at the Milestone Hotel in London, and I can say enough about the service, the style of the hotel, the convenience to getting around, and the friendly staff.  The breakfast was excellent, and the lovely parlor room with the roaring fire was so nice.  Every detail is complete in their rooms and the service that you receive.   In addition, they have a really cool resistance pool - it's a great way to exercise and unwind at the end of the day."
November 2012,Excellent stay!,"We stayed at The Milestone Hotel in December and our stay there was absolutely brilliant! During this stay, I asked my girlfriend to marry me. In the preparation for this occasion, I've probably exchanged over 20 e-mails with the hotel to make sure everything would be perfectly in order. They promised it would be excellent, and boy, did they deliver!  We booked the Mistinguett suite for two nights. Upon arrival, we were met by our butler who showed us around the hotel and the suite. 2 glasses of Champagne immediately appeared for us to enjoy.  I had made some specific requirements for the special occasion, and it seemed the entire hotel staff was into the plan. Even the ladies at the reception were very enthusiastic and when asking them a question (without my girlfriend nearby),‚Ä¶"
September 2012,Luxury home away from home,"The good: Beautiful Victorian house, SUPERB CUSTOMER CARE, cozy common areas, great bar, and beautiful tea room.  Incredible staff that one would like to take home (special mention to: Pedro the ""everything to everyone guy"", Markus and Dickson at the bar, and the concierge staff). We were in a large family group so I was able to see several rooms.  All are uniquely decorated and well appointed, with the deluxe rooms being on the smaller side and some lacking in storage area, but with good modern bathrooms.  The Safari jr. suite is fabulous The not so good: At the southwest end of Hyde Park (Kensington Gardens), it is not walking distance from the great area of attractions of Piccadilly, Oxford, Regent, Harrods, museums, Parliament, etc.  However there is a Tube station about 3‚Ä¶"
November 2012,wonderful hotel,I recently stayed at the Milestone Hotel (September 2012) and would definitely give it an excellent rating.  The room had every amenity (stayed in Deluxe King)  you could want and the staff couldn't do enough for you.  The location was good - right near the hop on/off bus - I would definitely stay there again and would highly recommend it.    cj - connecticut
November 2012,Concierge not helpful,"I am staying at the hotel now..I booked through AmEx Fine Hotel and Resorts program. The hotel is located in a mostly resdiential area. The main sites in London, according to the concierge are a 25 minute cab ride away. With the exchange rate, that's about 50 dollars, one way.  I asked the concierge this evening for a nice place in the area to get the flavor of London and he didn't have any suggestions.    The rest of the staff is helpful, but I expected more the for the rating and the cost."
October 2012,Great Service,"I booked a superior room, which was the cheapest fare. Well everything is definitely 5-star, except the size of the room. It feels smaller than Travelodge rooms. One might think its ecological because the room heats up by your body heat, (its that small, but you get what you pay) but then on the other hand, using the aircondition or opening the window helps. Still great, will come again. The small room is fine for a night and on single occupancy. Staying longer needs upgrading..."
July 2012,Wonderful experience,"Stayed here as part of a birthday celebration. We could not fault the hotel at all. What a beautiful place but what made the stay perfect was the staff. Everyone who worked in the hotel were polite, friendly and helpful. We will definitely be staying at the milestone again. Thank you again for such a wonderful time."
November 2011,Afternoon tea at the Milestone :),"My teenage daughter, husband and I really enjoyed the afternoon tea experience at the Milestone.  The service is incredible, the tea rooms are just as the pictures show and the tea and cakes - unforgettable!  We had a wonderful time.  Our waiter was very funny, putting us at ease."
October 2012,my absolute favorite!!,"My fianc√© and I are pretty seasoned travelers and have stayed in some amazing hotels all over, but OMIGOD this is my hands-down favorite hotel!! we usually go for more contemporary hotels with modern design, so we were wary of the very traditional look of the Milestone initially. As soon as we parked our car around the corner (!!! we could PARK...that was a great start! haha) and walked in the lobby, we were blown away by how wonderful and attentive the staff were. Our bags were whisked away and replaced with flutes of champagne, and we were greeted by name...""You must be Mr and Mrs Rawding, welcome"". The looks on our faces mustve been priceless. What a stellar greeting. As we were checking in, we were casually lamenting the fact that we were unable to secure a reservation at‚Ä¶"
August 2012,warts and all review,"My wife and I have just returned from a weekend at the Milestone Hotel to celebrate our 14th wedding anniversary. I've been lucky enough to stay at some wonderful hotels throughout the world, both on business and for pleasure from Bournemouth to Bora Bora, but have to say this was one of the nicest experiences yet.   From Manvee on the phone when booking, the doorman on arrival, the reception staff, the concierge, the bar staff (fantastic cocktails by the way!) and the cleaner I passed in the hallway Sunday morning; every interaction with the people who work there leave you feeling like a truly valued customer.  I'm trying to give a balanced review, warts and all, but I honestly I can't fault it.   Following my hotel choice my wife finally recognises what a great bloke I am, so‚Ä¶"
September 2012,olympic experience,"returned to The Milestone for the second Olympic week to celebrate 2 birthdays and an anniversary and everything about our stay confirmed that this hotel is an outstanding property. Our room, overlooking Kensington Gardens was beautiful and the staff was once again friendly, pleasant and went out of their way to make us feel like valued guests. Our anniversary was noted with roses and candles making  our first evening on this trip a special memory.If you have an opportunity, a stay at TheMilestone is a experience not to be missed."
September 2012,Milestone Apartment = Amazing!,"Where to start praising this amazing hotel? My husband and I stayed in Apartment 1 for seven nights in mid-September. First of all, the staff was incredible. We never walked through the lobby without someone acknowledging ""Mr. and Mrs. Jones"" and holding open a door, or calling us a cab. Everyone is so friendly and service-oriented. The hotel itself is great! The decor is beautiful and the dining & bar areas are very cozy.   Apartment 1 was great! There's a large living room/lounge on the main floor. We sat there a few times to catch the light coming in through the windows. The bedrooms, bathrooms and kitchen are downstairs; basically in a basement-like area. At first, it seemed a little darker and ""closer"" down there. But, after hearing some bumps and such from the floor above‚Ä¶"
September 2012,"If you want white glove service, this is your place","Stayed at the Milestone for 3 nights at the concluding part of a longer stay in GB.  We have travelled fairly extensively throughout the world and can say that the level of service at the Milestone is as good as we have experienced anywhere.   The property is beautifully decorated in an estate style, without seeming overwhelming.  If you want a grand soaring lobby with overwhelming spaces, this is not for you.  But if you want genteel luxury, try out the Milestone.  Note that our room was a bit cramped, although well furnished.  If you want a larger room, such are available at a higher price point, but in truth this is a true 5 star property and is priced accordingly so this comment is made by way of advice and not complaint, since if you plan to stay here, cost is probably not‚Ä¶"
September 2012,What a wonderful stay,"We only stayed the one night,however the hotel and staff were fantastic throughout. Celebrating our Annivesary,they could not have done any more to make it feel so wonderful. The service we received from every member of staff was of the highest quality and we were made to feel very special at all times. On returning from our night out the romm was prepared and rose petals were scatterred throught and candles were lit everywhere.The English Breakfast was suberb. The Afternoon Tea was truly devine and a lovely way to end our stay at the Hotel. We look forward to going back again in the very near future."
October 2011,Simply the best,My wife and I spent 2 nights at the Milestone.  After a long flight from Australia we were delighted by the level of service from the time we arrived.  Nothing was too much trouble for the wonderful staff.  The room was comfortable and the facilities everything you could ever need. There is also no better location for seeing the sights of London.  We would recommend it to anyone!
September 2012,HOME AWAY FROM HOME,"This review is well overdue as it has been a while since our last stay at this beautiful hotel/home.   Rooms are beautiful, service is charming, food is fantastic. Everything is close by. Nothing is too much trouble. Children are treated so kindly by such friendly staff.   In summary, it's like stepping into a bubble of calm and homeliness after a busy day in London. Great for families, business and lone travellers.   Love it. Would not stay anywhere else - unless fully booked! Many thanks for such a memorable stay."
August 2012,glamorous holidays,It is a gorgeous hotel located in one of the richest areas of London. Luxury rooms and provided with very adequated facilities. Butler service is provided for the guests. The staff is highly educated and efficient. A hotel to come back!
September 2012,Royal Treatment,"This was our first trip to London and we are so glad that a friend recommended The Milestone Hotel.  From the moment we walked in until the day we left, every staff member treated us like royalty.  Truly no request was too small.  When checking in we had an unexpected and much appreciated upgrade to an apartment that we fell in love with immediately.  Every area of The Milestone was so beautiful and elegant with lovely rooms to hang out and relax and have a drink or cup of tea. If you go, do not miss out on a fantastic culinary experience in The Cheneston Restaurant.  We are looking forward to another trip next year and would not think of staying anywhere else.  Doug and Sherry G"
August 2012,No better hotel in London,"We stayed here again and it was, as before, perfection.  Everything about the hotel is top notch - intimate common areas, concierge, blue light in the bathroom at night, turndown service, etc., but best of all is the first-rate staff and the impeccable service.  You call once and it is done.  We will definitely be back!"
August 2012,Flawless Hospitality,"I wanted to take the time to share my excellent experience at The Milestone Hotel this summer.  I had the privilege of working along side the management team for a high profile Canadian corporate group who were attending the 2012 Olympic summer games in London. I truly could not have been more impressed by the genuine hospitality that I received from the entire service team. The Milestone Hotel was our base for 3 weeks and every one of our guests were completely impressed and delighted with all the staff that they encountered. I myself have worked in the hospitality industry for 20 years and have never in my career seen such passion for service as I did with this team. Their motto of ""No request is too large - No detail is too small"" is evident in all departments. Sometimes it‚Ä¶"
August 2012,"Fantastic hotel, Wonderful experience","I got to know the hotel in February when I was looking for a place to have afternoon tea in London and found the address on the list of the Top London Tea Place Awards 2011. I had the chance to visit some of the rooms at that time and immediately fell in love with the hotel and could not think about anything else than coming back. The decoration is exactly matching my taste; it is very traditional and very beautiful. So after a few months of patience and of dreaming about it, I finally came back last weekend and had an amazing stay. I had booked a superior double room and was hoping secretly to get upgraded, and when I arrived at the reception I was informed that my wish came true and I was offered a Deluxe King!! The room was magnificent with a beautiful view on Kensington‚Ä¶"
September 2012,Unforgettable weekend.... Thank you!,"My wife and i stayed at the milestone for our one year wedding anniversary recently and it was without doubt the best hotel experience we have ever had. Having stayed at a number of London's finest hotels this hotel truly trumps them all. Everything was absolutely perfect from start to finish, the staff are all absolutely charming, polite, engaging and clearly all enjoying their time at the Milestone as much as we were. This creates a wonderfully relaxed yet refined experience, perfect for a romantic getaway. As mentioned in most of the other reviews here, the little touches and extras provided really do make the difference and this really makes the Milestone stand out from the crowd. Thank you again to all the staff we met, and we are both recommending the hotel to anyone who‚Ä¶"
September 2012,Gracious and friendly,"The Milestone Hotel is quintessentially English, with beautiful rooms and public areas honouring the best of British style and a warm welcome from staff making us feel like honoured guests.  Breakfasts were superb, as were thoughtful touches such as fresh fruit and house-made cookies in our room.  Attention to detail was evident in every aspect of our stay, which was perfect in all respects."
September 2012,Love this hotel!,"We are currently relaxing in our beautiful room at the Milestone and I felt compelled to write a review right away before I forget all the elemets that have wowed us since our arrival this afternoon!  First we were greeted with very warm welcomes from the staff, then we were given a tour of the hotel by the Butler, Pedro. Next we were treatedto complimentary drinks from the bar.  As if that wasn't enough, beautiful little gifts awaited us in our room...a perfume scented sachet for my smelly luggage, a tray of fresh fruit, a ribboned package of dried dates..etc.  On the television apersonnalized welcome message was displayed!  Later themaid left a flower vase with a note asking if we preferedher not touching our personal items when cleaning!  Tonight another little gift left‚Ä¶"
September 2012,Authentic elegance and comfort,"Dear Mr. Pike, My partner and I recently stayed at your hotel to celebrate her 50th birthday.  I simply can't thank you and your staff for making her birthday truly memorable.  We appreciated the room upgrade to the Venetian Suite and the thoughtful touches from canapes in the evening, to the birthday morning breakfast.  But most importantly, as has been the hallmark of your hotel, was the thoughtful service...not imposing or overbearing, but simply hospitable and considerate. We both travel internationally for business and have experienced the grandeur of the Raffles in Singapore, to the flamboyance of the One and Only Royal Mirage in Dubai, to what is considered the gold standard of service at the Mandarin Oriental in Bangkok, but for my partner's birthday we wanted to‚Ä¶"
September 2012,Our new favorite hotel in London,"What an incredible experience.  The staff was phenomenal in anticipating our every need, the room was great with everything ... Including 2 summer and winter robes, fresh fruit and a welcome note from the manager...the bar was beautiful with hand-crafted cocktails and the restaurant was superb with great food and over the top attentive service."
September 2012,once you have tried this hotel you will never go anywhere else in London.,We have just arrived home from a five day stay in the Milestone. From the time you arrive to the time they put you in the taxi and say goodbye the service is excellent.. All of the teams go out of their way to make sure your stay is perfect. They called us by our name at all times greeting us in the morning and on return to the hotel. We were recommended The Churchill pub a short walk away and one of the staff showed me a picture of the pub he had taken on his phone of it that morning!! Having stayed at this hotel we will never go anywhere else in London. This hotel is five star in everything it does. Well done to the whole team.
September 2012,Personal luxury,This hotel is my so far first choice when staying in London. The hotel has a very personal touch by all the staff members and you are beein reconized by everyone in the staff who always are willing to help you with anything.  Just a few minutes to Kenington high str supwaystation or just take the bus a few step from the hotel if you like to travel above ground.   The food is excellent by the Norwegian chef and so so good.  We stayed for two days and had a lovely time and it's just ashame we did not have time to try the poolrelaxing area.  My warmest recommendations.
September 2012,It couldn't have been a better stay...,"We stayed at the Milestone Hotel on Saturday for one night for a long weekend in London for  a celebration. We arrived by taxi, and were met by a well dressed doorman, ( Hat and tails) who advised us to leave the luggage and to go into the hotel, ' he would look after the luggage for us. - our weekend had started straight away.   We were met by very welcoming staff politely and quietly in a sincere and warm fashion. Lovely.   Check In was confirmed and we were advised we were in a beautiful room and luggage would follow shortly. It did - within 7 minutes on arrival in our room ! The room was breathtaking, and a birthday card was on the table from the staff and management and a birthday cake followed within minutes after a phone call offering a welcome drink, whilst we got ready‚Ä¶"
September 2012,Afternoon tea *****,Had afternoon tea today at the milestone I was a bit nervous going in as it was really posh deffinatly not a jeans n tshirt place. On entering the hotel the staff were really friendly and welcoming. The afternoon tea was super we had the half bottle of champagne option and for london and the selection and amount of food you got I felt it was good value. 
August 2012,Excellent service will so many extra personal touches,"We stayed at the Milestone as part of a birthday/anniversary treat.  Nothing was too much trouble, the staff were friendly and very welcoming. Our room was spotless and we were greeted with a welcome glass of champagne to help us settle in.  Well recommended!"
May 2012,Superb,"Stayed there with my miss while visiting friends in London. If you are used to 5-star service, this hotel will not disappoint. Spacious and very well appointed rooms, decorated in Victorian style, friendly staff, personalised service. Location is fantastic, even if you (like we) are not interested in doing much tourism. We stayed there for 2 nights and had wish our visit was longer. Will definitely stay back if back in London."
August 2012,Milestone - outstanding experience,"I love everything about this hotel. From the minute you make contact to plan your stay, the service, my room, personal touch on every level is like being home and treated with special care. The accomodations were lovely - the location was perfect for getting around London - easy  walk to the tube; great neighborhood to explore; great  restaurants, museums and parks in walking distance; I was traveling alone some of the time and never felt lonely or unattended to. Staff are like friends now. Concierge staff, bar staff, front desk staff, restaurant staff-everyone looking for ways to make your stay perfect.The restaurant was wonderful -  Hotel manager Andrew sets the right culture of service there and I know something about this in my line of business. I've been twice now and‚Ä¶"
July 2012,Milestones Hotel,"Everything about this little botique hotel was perfect. The staff, ambiance, quality, service, friendliness, helpfullness and above all the entire experience was excellent.  Everyone did as much as they could to ensure your stay was perfect. We were addressed by name as soon as we arrived, our car was parked and collect for us. My boyfriend had a birthday gift and card.  If you needed anything they were only to willing to help. We will be back and just know it will be a wonderful experience.  It was recommended by the Royal Albert Hall and so they gave us a 20% which created a good feel."
July 2012,Wonderful Stay,"We stayed there for a couple of weeks, Great location right across from the park,the hotel offers a lovely atmosphere, very friendly, traditional English decor which we loved. Great service. We will definitely go back."
July 2012,The Milestone Hotel - the very Best of British !!,I stayed at The Milestone for the first week of the Olympics.This Hotel made the holiday even more memorable.This is the best hotel I have ever stayed in and it is the staff who make it such a great place. The service is excellent and you are made to feel so welcome and so much at home. Additionally the Hotel is in a great location in London so that you can walk to all the main tourist attractions after having a wonderful breakfast of fresh fruit and cooked English.The rooms - both bedrooms and public rooms are extremely comfortable and cosy.No request is too much to ask for.I cannot recommend this Hotel more highly and I am already planning my next stay here. David Cullen
July 2012,Excellent,"Stayed here few nights and loved every moment. The hotel has lovely cosy rooms, staff are very friendly, service is great and atmosphere is so welcoming . They makes you feel so valued and special. Highly recommended!"
July 2012,BEYOND BELIEF!!,"We just arrived safely back in Vancouver, BC after an absolutely AMAZING 5 night stay at the Milestone Hotel in London.  I could not get to the computer fast enough to write this review and tell the world how wonderful the Milestone made our stay in London. From the moment we turned to walk into your hotel, we had respectful, kind and caring greeters waiting to help us. Waves, smiles and extremely professional-classy engagement from everyone in the lobby occurred on every venture through the area. It really felt like coming home to a welcoming family each time we landed from a very long, fun-filled, busy Olympic days....""The mist"" (as Grant called it) never drizzled on anyone spirits! Our room, the service, the fresh flowers and elegance of our surroundings were second to none.‚Ä¶"
July 2012,Lovely,"Recently been to London for a business trip and stayed in this hotel for 2 nights. They have lovely,comfortable and cozy rooms, great service and nice atmosphere, staff were very friendly and helpful. I would love to stay here again"
July 2012,Wonderful hotel!,We spent three fabulous days at The Milestone Hotel.  The staff was by far the best we've ever encountered.  They knew our names and went out of their way to spoil us!  The welcome gifts were very thoughtful and the treats in the evening were much appreciated.  Our 10 year old daughter was thrilled with the assortment of candies and goodies placed with her in mind! Our room was gorgeous and we had an incredible view of Kensington.  The Milestone Hotel was the first of three 5-Star Hotels we visited during our 9 day vacation in Europe and it was by far our favorite!  We hope to stay with you again!
July 2012,Great hotel,"This is a lovely boutique hotel.  The staff are extremely helpful and friendly.  Every staff member called me by name (not totally sure how they all knew!)  The welcome gifts in the room are a nice surprise.  Nice parting letter stating they can pack your luggage or pack you an  ""airline picnic.""  Although my room was small, it was very cozy and beautifully decorated!"
May 2012,Excellent service hotel,"I have just spent a night in the Milestones but I was trully surprised with the details offered in every moment (ex. cookies in the room + welcome drink and cappuccino for my daughter + handwritten welcome card), efficiency in reservation, check-in, room service, the personalized service calliing my surname from the begginning to the end, from bellman to housekeeper. The room was not very big but the bed was.  There was robe for me and my 9 year old daughter, and all kind of facilities in the bathroom and room. What called my attentio was the service in the hotel in all sections.  It was great to spend the last day of the trip in the Milestones and I was very pleased with it."
May 2012,The best service ever.,"This hotel had the best service. If I even thought I wanted something, they were right there. The breakfast was amazing. The waffles are a work of art. The staff was friendly and helpful and the high tea was amazing. We stayed in the Safari suite. It was huge and decorated in a whimsical manner. The location is great. The tube station is right down the block and there is tons of shopping and places to eat, not to mention that Kensington Palace is right across the street. Don't miss the sunken garden, a hidden treasure! Loved it!"
April 2012,Average Hotel With Poor Internet Service,"I am basically confirming the comments made by those reviewers who rate this expensive hotel as merely average. ¬†Our room was very small; we could hardly get past the furnishings and into the bathroom. Indeed, the latter was almost as big as the bedroom. ¬†The staff was ungracious, with the front door being unmanned most evenings we returned from sightseeing. ¬†Although there was staff inside, it was only on the third night of our four night stay that someone acknowledged us.¬†  One of the most annoying things is the poor Internet service. I need to stay in contact with my several businesses through the Internet. Despite being assured of excellent Internet service when we booked, we kept getting bumped off, the signal was weak and the service was slow.  The location of the hotel in‚Ä¶"
March 2012,Fab afternoon tea,"I booked to have afternoon tea here while my Spanish friend visited with his Japanese girlfriend and was so happy I chose The Milestone. They were both totally blown away by the experience! They thought the setting in the park lounge, sat by the fire, was perfeclty British and couldn't get over how great the food was, nor how much of it there was!  Even my friend, husband and I for who this was not our first afternoon tea thought this was the best we have been to in London so far. It's really relaxed and cosy and the service is excellent, very attentive and they are very willing to bring more of whatever you need. Great selection of teas too. I would suggest booking later on in the day as there is more chance of getting a seat by the fire."
April 2012,Loved the Milestone,"I usually stay at the Royal Garden over the road (which I also love), but we had older members of the family who could afford the Milestone. It was a super experience.  We had a family do in central London and were in and out for two days. I can't thank the staff, and particularly the doorman, enough for how smooth they made it for us.  My old mother loved it and would love to stay there again.  But it would also be amazing for something romantic, like an anniversary. I adored breakfast in the lovely green dining room, and I thought what a lovely place it would be for a quiet breakfast meeting (again, in contrast to one at the Royal Garden which also has a lovely dining room but is usually busier). All in all it was a fantastic luxury experience."
November 2011,The Most Incredible Hotel in Kensington!,"My husband and I recently celebrated our 55th anniversary at The Milestone Hotel in London.  It was a return visit - we knew how fabulous the hotel, staff, and amenities would be. But this time, The Milestone staff went above and beyond!  When we returned from dinner on our anniversary, our room had been strewn with rose petals, floating candles were everywhere, champagne was chilling in the ice bucket, soft music was playing, and chocolate strawberries were on the desk!  What an amazing surprise!  Everything about the Milestone is perfect - the most elegant afternoon tea, a scrumptious breakfast buffet, and a concierge and butler who really care, and stand ready to help with even the tiniest request.  We love The Milestone, and hope to be back for another memorable visit in the‚Ä¶"
May 2012,worthy of the praise,"My review reflects the 5-star reviews of the Milestone's other guests. It is a quaint, friendly, warm and luxurious little hotel with a big hart. My daughter and I stayed here for 4 nights and enjoyed everything the hotel has to offer - from their superb dinners, lovely breakfast to high tea."
May 2012,Fifth time and always a treat,"This is my fifth visit in the last two years. Great luxury hotel with a very good breakfast, very high class rooms and a good resturant for dinner. Small pool and gym. All in very good taste, high maintenance and good staff."
August 2011,Treat yourself,Just finished 7 days at the Milestone.  What a great taste of English living.  The hotel has a limited nuimber of rooms and a large staff that is constantly trying to please you.  No request is to small and they take pride in everything they do.    You just cannot go wrong by staying there.
May 2012,The Milestone,"Were there for a week. The rooms were charming and unique, but you need a suite to be able to move around, so that is what we got. The service is very personal and their afternoon tea the best I ever had. The concierge was very talented when it comes to restaurants but with a hiccup; I wanted  them to get us some theater tickets which they actually declined because their agent could not get them. These were not special tickets but this particular show was obviously not on their agents list. That was a let down. They also promised my son a special supprise at the Lion King show which never materialized. Thankfully I never told him so there were no expectations.  The spa looked liked like something from eastern europe 1940 so I never really tried the treatments. The breakfast was‚Ä¶"
March 2012,"Charming, Elegant Boutique Hotel near Kensington Palace","The Milestone Hotel exceeded my expectations. The service is top notch. The decor is breathtaking - my favorite area was the bar, which used to be the stables for this stately mansion. Each room is individually decorated with a distinct personality and when you book your reservation, the team will send you a ""preference list"" which will ask you for things like your favorite drink, newspaper, type of bedding, favorite colors, etc. I imagine this is how they select rooms for their guests, etc. If you are looking to stay in one of the best properties in London, the Milestone  Hotel needs to be on your list. And if the hotel wasn't enough to attract you, how about knowing that Kensington Palace sits literally across the street in Hyde Park? Also a great place for run!"
March 2012,Impecable Service Levels,"I haven't contributed here for a long time but this charming hotel has encouraged me to review again. The hotel is very handsome both inside and out with fabulous views over Kensington Gardens but it's most outstanding element is the very personal levels of service.  The hotel feels intimate and cosy, unusual for central London. The staff are extremely friendly, helpful and efficient.  The rooms whilst not huge are richly decorated and unique.   Breakfast is good though the dining room is a little twee for me. The Stables Bar is minute but pleasant for a post theatre drink and you can overspill into the lovely Conservatory. And a great location for the Royal Albert Hall.  All in all, delightful."
August 2011,Near Perfection!,"My family and I recently stayed at the Milestone, and we could not have been more pleased.  A smaller hotel located right in the heart of Kensington, it was in a very convenient place, which made sightseeing easy.  We had two suites, which were quite large and accommodating.  They were also most clean and neat, and there were some nice little touches, such as a plate of small fruits provided every evening. I was most impressed with the level of service, which was impeccable.  All members of the hotel staff knew us by name, were solicitous of our needs, and were always most polite.  Not even my sometimes-rambunctious 9 year old could rattle them, and their courtesy was always extended to my children, which was most appreciated.     The hotel has a wonderful and renowned‚Ä¶"
March 2012,Fabulous Experience,Stayed here for a week last August for a girls trip with my young daughters and the service and accommodations could not have been better. Both Neil at the front desk and Neil the concierge were incredibly helpful and Pedro gave the kids a wonderful tour that was part of the family package we booked. We had a wonderful dinner in cheneston's one night with my parents who were visiting at the same time - highly recommend the Dover Sole! This trip was a very special splurge for us and this hotel did not disappoint.
March 2012,Excellent Boutique Hotel,"I travel every week to London and it's been a very pleasant surprise to discover The Milestone. Excellent service, taking care of every need. Good restaurant also, including an amazing wine list. Finally, the location is perfect. Will repeat."
July 2011,Great service,"This hotel is a luxurious place to stay. The facilities are excellent which include a pool and a gym. The staff could not have been better and pedro the butler was great showing us round the hotel and resolving any issues. The area could not be better near hyde park, the tube and museums. A big thanks to all the staff and I could not thing of anything bad about the hotel. We would recommend this hotel and will come back in the future."
October 2011,Excellent !!!!!,"We stayed last year for one week with our two kids and it was the best experience.  Alexandra ,the receptionist, was very helpful and very nice , but most important , very professional.  Location is unbeatable and restaurant was wonderful."
March 2012,A private club with no attitude,"Although it is a bit pricey, Milestone delivers a real personal touch in a fine environment.   The head guy in the restaurant has endless stories about this and that-----the breakfast is great (excellent scottish smoked salmon)----location is great too.   The rooms are fine, very comfortable and well kept, but nothing extraordinary when compared to other hotels of this category."
January 2012,Suite is the way to go,"We have just returned from our weekend trip to London, we enjoyed it very much.  The hotel was so friendly and not at all stuffy, people were engaging and genuinely interested in anything they could help you with.  The room we had was a suite and it was truly spectacular even down to the candlelit bathroom.  The room overlooked the park, so when booking its best to ask for a room that over looks the Park, as some can look onto the conservatory which can be a bit noisy at times.  As regards to the food, if I am honest we were not impressed at all, very expensive and all quite cold.  breakfast was really nice, so if you I were you I would use the facilities this hotel has to offer but eat elsewhere after all you are in London tons to choose from.  Overall definitely visit again."
February 2012,A special treat,"We'd previously stayed at the Milestone for a show in the Royal Albert Hall in 2010 and when I was looking for a special treat for my wife a few months after the arrival of our baby in November 2011, I knew the Milestone would be the perfect place. It sounds like a cliche but from the very moment you arrive at the entrance, you are made feel completely welcome by everyone in a genuine, warm-hearted manner. The attention from then until the moment you leave is like no other hotel I have ever stayed in without ever being over-bearing. We especially loved the little touches in the room when we returned to it after our dinner. We would come to London especially just to stay here."
March 2012,5* luxury - making a special occasion even more special!,"We stayed at The Milestone in February for one night, as part of a surprise birthday getaway which my husband organised.  We stayed in a deluxe double room (no. 310) which, being on the third floor and on the front of the hotel, had great views over Hyde Park.  We weren't aware of any traffic noise at all - very quiet.  The room was spacious and clean with a wonderful en-suite bathroom.  Free wi-fi in your room.  Fruit platter and welcome drink on arrival plus an informative tour of the hotel.  We didn't stay for afternoon tea as we were dashing off to the theatre, but we have had afternoon tea at The Milestone before and I would highly recommend it - a wonderful experience.  Nearest tube station is High Street Kensington (just 5 mins walk away), or the hotel will organise taxis‚Ä¶"
April 2012,Simply the home-liest hotel in London,"The Milestone Hotel is our home away from home while in London.  There's something very special about this boutique hotel starting with the location, the warmth of the entire staff, the overall ambience, the decor, the service, the food and above all, the personal touch given on personal requests - this aspect is what I consider to be the hallmark of this cozy hotel. Every request is given the kind of attention that makes one feel spoilt.  After trying several 5-star hotels in London, the Milestone Hotel remains the place for us.  Looking forward to my next visit this month for the 46th time in 7 years!"
April 2012,Excellent place to stay,"Very quiet, clean, upscale, and really cared for us.  Made sure we were doing ok - in a polite English way.  Meals, music with them, the tea in the afternoon, the frontdesk all made the stay one of our most pleasant and comfortable we have had."
April 2012,Faultless afternoon tea,"When in London, we usually have afternoon tea in one of the big five star hotels, so we weren't sure what to expect from a boutique hotel like the Milestone, but were seduced into trying it by an online photo of the Park Lounge. We weren't disappointed. The ambience of the Lounge was fantastic with rich fabrics and huge bookcases of old books - warm, welcoming and sumptuous. The tea itself was great: plentiful finger sandwiches, including a chicken one rolled in chopped almonds; light, warm scones with cream and a delightful strawberry/raspberry mixed jam, plus a good selection of dainty tea pastries - we needed a doggie bag for those! The service was attentive but discreet. We really couldn't fault the whole experience and look forward to going again."
April 2012,Absolute Gem,"Just had a wonderful weekend at the Milestone Hotel, and highly highly recommend this little gem.  I genuinely couldn't fault anything about this wonderful hotel, from the location, to the warm, welcoming and caring staff, to the gorgeous food and wine at the restaurant.  The room was charming, and the bed the most comfortable I've slept in.    Thank you for having us!"
April 2012,Second time around and still wonderful,"We stayed at the Milestone approximately two years ago and it was great, so we went back on our recent trip.  Things HAVE NOT changed.  We had a bigger suite this time, Prince Albert Master Suite and were much happier with the additional room.  Still great service and ambience.  Scones, tea sandwiches were lovely.  The restaurant is great.  Good going Milestone.  Many hotels do not maintain their excellent standards."
April 2012,Amazing afternoon tea,"I picked the Milestone for afternoon tea as the dining room looked really intimate, comfortable and had lovely charm. When we arrived the staff couldn't have been more polite or helpful. The selection of teas was fantastic and there was more than enough delicious sandwiches, warm scones and cakes to go round. Often with afternoon teas in London the cakes are a little sub standard, more attention going onto appearance than taste but that was definitely not the case here. We had a lovely relaxing afternoon, so much so that time ran away with us before we'd had a chance to have our complimentary cocktail but the staff we very willing to serve us in the bar area which was fabulous, very 'ralph lauren' style with horse painting and a cigar room vibe.  I'd whole heartedly recommend‚Ä¶"
April 2012,Outstanding service and attention to detail,"A colleague and I stayed at this luxury hotel for two nights at short notice. The staff were extremely welcoming upon our arrival and gave us a guided tour of the facilities whilst our luggage was taken upstairs.  The rooms (a King Double and Studio) were unforgettable; true luxury which was a welcome retreat at the end of each day.  On top of the luxury of each room, the services were excellent. Satellite TV, reliable Internet access and top draw room service.  Our breakfast each morning was superb and the hotel is literally 3 minutes walk from High Street Kensington tube station (sadly our expenses policy didn't quite cover the use of the hotels Chauffeur driven Bentley...).  Highly recommended all round!"
January 2012,superb hotel,"Visited this hotel April 2012, and the hotel is exceptional in many ways; from top location to quality of rooms and decor, topped off with a commitment to great service you wont see in many places in London.  I was on business on this occasion but already looking into a family stay at the hotel.  All in all very special and although price reflects this - it is far superior to all of the chain hotels which offer similar rates."
November 2011,another great stay,"Just returned from another great stay at The Milestone - was traveling to London alone this time and booked a queen bedded room- I was given a beautiful king room facing Kensington Gardens- the desk was situated in a dormer with a round window- just a great space to use my computer-internet connection is excellent- again, wonderful, friendly service- also The Milestone is kid friendly - my 2 year old grandson comes to visit and he always gets a warm welcome plus the doormen lift the stroller up and down the stairs with nice greeting and a smile"
February 2011,Afternoon Tea,"I  highly recommend The Milestone  Champagne Afternoon Tea.  A selection of finger sandwiches and freshly baked scones with Devonshire clotted cream with a pot of tea of your choice, starting with a bottle of chilled Champagne in historical and elegant surroundings.  You don't have to stay in the hotel, but wisely book a table.  You will never forget you went there! 2 minutes walk from Kensington High Street!"
January 2012,Unique Boutique across form the Palace,"This hotel was recommended by an English friend and was his residence when he sold his house (there are also apartments here ). Very low key, understated elegance and staff. I had a beautiful room facing Kensington Palace and the street but it was fairly quiet though a little cramped with a view of the lawn. My friend took a basement room that had a large dressing area for her and her daughters. Nice size but one small window. The food was good and the rate included breakfast and some other perks at the time. This is owned by the Red Carnation group who has several hotels in London. Located on the High Street with a Whole foods and branch store of top shop in Kensington. If you want to feel like a very pampered resident, across from the Duke and Duchess then this is the place‚Ä¶"
December 2011,Tea at The Milestone - a very English experience,"If you've been following my other reviews on The Milestone it will come as no surprise to you to learn that the afternoon tea at The Milestone is also a very pleasant affair. We opted to have a glass of Champagne before we started on the tea itself and used this moment to take in our surroundings whilst we sipped the Champagne from the stylish tulip style Champagne glasses The Milestone uses. The nicest part about the lounge atmosphere at The Milestone is that it's like being invited by the owner of a period house to tea in his personal library - complete with roaring log fire. The Lounge here is not big so you'd definitely need to book ahead to be sure of securing a place. There is an extensive tea menu, so there will definitely be a tea to suit everyone's mood. The sandwiches‚Ä¶"
December 2011,Truly a wonderful experience,"Our first time at The Milestone Hotel and truly a wonderful experience. Very good service with attention to details. A luxurious but cosy atmosphere, you feel at home the moment you enter the hotel. We stayed in a deluxe king bedroom (couple and child 7 y.o.). Great breakfast and afternoon tea. Kind attention for our child."
April 2012,The most amazing experience,"We recently stayed at the Milestone Hotel in one of their apartments.  We were traveling with 2 teenage children and my mother.  The accomodations were fabulous!  We had so much space and the rooms were beautful. The service was exceptional...the hotel didn't know what to do for us next and the food was great. Breakfast was wonderful, we really enjoyed high tea and had a lovely dinner one eve in the hotel sitting by the fireplace. The concierge service was top notch. In fact, I forgot my house keys at the hotel and they immediately sent my keys back to me in the states. I travel alot for business and pleasure and must say that this was one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. I highly recommend this hotel and will definately stay there on our next trip to London.  It‚Ä¶"
March 2012,"Small, beautiful and excellent hotel! Wow!","We stayed one week at Milestone in March 2012.  This hotel is very special and is a real 5 stars hotel.  Beautiful decor in our room, excellent service from everybody from the concierge to the room service.  The food was excellent,  the decor unforgettable.  Everybody made us feel good.  Perfectly located.  We will choose this hotel again for sure and will remember the truly warm hospitality.  You won't regret your stay."
February 2012,Very nearly excellent,"I was looking for a nice and traditional place to have afternoon-tea in London and I found The Milestone on the list of the Top London Tea Place Awards 2011.  So I was sure I was going to find something very nice.  And The Milestone has by far exceeded my expectations. I had the best afternoon-tea ever! The room where the afternoon-tea takes place is a very beautiful room, with a magnificent decoration. I was seated in the Library where I had the feeling that time had stopped.  I had a very nice view on Kensington gardens.  The food itself was absolutely fantastic.  I am looking forward to go back and I don't want to have afternoon tea somewhere else in London now.  I also had the chance to visit the hotel. The rooms are nicely decorated.  Every room is decorated in a different‚Ä¶"
December 2011,Christmas magic,"Having previously stayed at sister properties 41 Hotel, Rubens, and most recently at Egerton House Hotel, this hotel was very good, clearly five star calibre, but we did not have the same consistently exceptional experiences as we did at 41 and Egerton. Perhaps it was because we were staying over Christmas, but more on that to come. First, the positives...  Positives: Milestone Hotel is in a wonderful location, right across from Hyde Park and just down the street from all the great shopping in Kensington. There are several of the city bike rental stations nearby (highly recommended for exploring the parks). The hotel is beautiful and historic, with very impressive common areas; the lounge and conservatory are especially cozy. When we arrived, we were greeted with glasses of‚Ä¶"
December 2011,Wonderful place to stay.,"We wre back at the Milestone again, and pleased to say thet the 'nightly little problems' (see my previous review) appear to have been resolved. Great breakfasts, tremendous staff and one of the friendliest and knowledgeable Concierges I have met - thanks Jose. Will be back.."
December 2011,The best by far..,"We were looking for somewhere special to spend our 10th wedding anniversary and Christmas, we found it at The Milestone. From the moment we walked in the door we knew we'd made the right choice. Everyone we met was so nice and welcomed you like a friend rather than a guest.  The room was big by London standards and the bathroom was also very spacious. We found a bottle of champagne in our room to congratulate us on our anniversary which was a lovely touch and also a birthday card. The bed was huge and the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in!  The rest of the hotel was beautifully decorated and felt warm and cozy. Breakfast was terrific with so many choices we had a different hot breakfast each morning! We didnt have afternoon tea but it looked amazing! Christmas dinner‚Ä¶"
December 2011,Just like being a member of an exclusive club,"The Milestone is a truly wondeful hotel, my partner and i were made to feel like we were coming home rather than residents of a hotel. Each member of staff took the time to talk to us personally and greeted us by first name, which was a lovely touch. The first time we visited we stayed in a master suite which was spotlessly clean and immaculately presented and overlooking kensington gardens; there was fresh fruit, flowers and champagne..all complimentary in the room upon arrival; the butler gave us a tour of the hotel and facilities and nothing we requested was declined, the level of service was the best either of us (who have travelled extensively) have ever experienced in a hotel. We have also stayed in a deluxe studio suite for an overnight stay and although smaller than the‚Ä¶"
January 2012,The best afternoon-tea ever,"As it was to be our last day in London before a long flight home to Australia, my husband and I decided to spend it in a little luxury at the Milestone Hotel.  The hotel was even more than we had imagined with butler service for all and an amazing menu and bar list.  The service was exceptional and the location right in the middle of London.  We would return again and stay longer.  Highly recommended."
December 2011,MAGNIFICENT MILESTONE STAY,"Stayed at Hotel 41 for four days before a cruise out of Southampton.  On the return, we stayed three nights at The Milestone including New Year's Eve.  We were so spoiled at Hotel 41 that we thought there was no way The Milestone could compare.  Well it did nicely.  We did not have that one on one feeling with staff like Hotel 41 but the staff at The Milestone was excellent.  The concierge spent time with us arranging a trip to Paris.  He took his time, booked the train tickets and printed them.  Whenever we needed to make or change a dinner reservation he did it with total class.  The bell staff was also very polite and they all seemed to know our name.  Our room at The Milestone was magnificent!!  Probably the nicest hotel room I have ever experienced.  Think it was the Tudor‚Ä¶"
December 2011,Our luxurious home from home in London,"We stayed at Milestone for five nights at Christmas, from 23 to 28 December, and we had our Christmas Eve Dinner and Christmas Day Lunch in Cheneston‚Äôs restaurant. This was our second stay at the hotel, and we had a perfect Christmas away from home. We loved every minute of it, and we have already booked our third stay in February 2012.  We have travelled quite a lot all over Europe, and we have visited several five star hotels. Milestone is by far the best of them, with warmth, personal service and a welcoming kindness that we have never found anywhere else. London is our favourite town, and Milestone is our favourite hotel.   We will recommend general manager Andrew Pike and his lovely staff in a wonderful Kensington building."
December 2011,Truly a home away from home...Outstanding!!,"My wife and I stayed at the Milestone Hotel for nine nights over the Christmas and New Year holiday.  I cannot say enough about the management, staff and hotel in general.  Without exception, every staff member treated us with the utmost respect and really, really seemed to care about our needs.    We initially had some concerns about staying in a hotel on Christmas Day but the Milestone and its staff made it a wonderful (and very memorable) day.  The day started by us finding a Christmas stocking with wrapped presents attached to our hotel room door on Christmas morning...then we had a fabulous full English breakfast in our room followed that evening by an outstanding dinner in Cheneston's Restaurant...finally, we capped off this great day with evening tea in the library (which‚Ä¶"
December 2011,Fantastic 50th Birthday Surprise!,"We stayed here in December for husbands 50th birthday.  He had no idea where we where going, everything had been booked and arranged in secret, and i am pleased to say, we both had a fantastic time.  All the staff are very friendly and helpful, nice touch to be called by your name, and also remembering what you had to drink the night before when ordering a drink the next evening. The staff we found, are about when required, and very helpful and friendly, not constantly hounding you!   Suite was beautiful, well equipped, romantic turndown was beautiful, and all the other little touches left in the room both nights.  Food was good, breakfast was beautiful, did have to wait for a table on the sunday morning, but not for long, maybe only 5 mins, so not a problem at all, nice chance‚Ä¶"
July 2011,The most supurb afternoon tea,"I had the pleasure of having afternoon tea with my fiance' and parents before going to Royal Albert Hall for a Christmas concert.  The Milestone had won the the Top London Tea Place awards of 2011, so I was curious if it had truly deserved this honour.  The hotel itself was absolutely divine.  Interiors of a high quality and very welcoming staff. The room in which the afternoon tea was served was was just the right size and very cozy and warm.  The environment was tranquil, peaceful and very civilized. It really is a place to enjoy the comforts of British food culture with good company.    The afternoon tea itself was of a very high quality and the presentation was immaculate.   The Milestone truly deserved its win in 2011 and I'm sure will continue to keep its reputation as the‚Ä¶"
September 2011,excellent place to stay,On arrival at the Milestone we were greeted by very friendly concierge staff who quickly organised our rooms and luggage. The junior suite had excellent taste and decor. The rooms had everything to make our stay comfitable. What made our stay enjoyable was the personel touches like the turn back of the bed with a book and book light together with chocolates on the pillows.The bathroom was filled with luxurious cosmetics of excellent taste. We have stayed at several 5* hotels in the city centre for conveniance but in our opinion nothing compares to the service and little extras provided at the Milestaone. My wife felt like a celebrity.  The hotel has an excellent view of Kennington Palace and Hyde Park. Keep up the good work.
October 2011,Service the old London way,"We arrived at The Milestone Hotel on September 10th  From the time we stepped from our cab until we were bid farewell at 7pm on September 13th, The service we received from your professional ,friendly staff was nothing less than outstanding.   Your hotel was recommended to us by our Travel Agent- James Irving of MTA Travel -Robina Queensland Australia James has been handling our travel arrangements for over 20 years and is very aware of our needs. The Milestone certainly measured up to our expectations and more. The staff, from the Door ,Reception, Bar,Restaurants,Service to room are all to be congratulated for their excellent service. A family member surprised us by booking into your hotel for 2 nights. We knew we had a very good package deal organised by James. I approached‚Ä¶"
January 2012,Wonderful hotel in good location,We stayed at The Milestone in early October and very much enjoyed the whole experience.  The public rooms are so beautiful and we were treated to a tour of the building after enjoying a welcome glass of champagne on arrival.  We enjoyed a pre-theatre dinner in the restaurant (which we had to ourselves) and it was really excellent.  Our room was a little on the small side but exquisitely furnished with a beautiful bathroom.   Unfortunately a carpenter was working on the conservatory roof outside our room in the afternoon when we wanted to take a short nap but we understand that maintenance has to be done at some time!  That was certainly the only negative.  The service was superb and all the staff bent over backwards to make sure we really enjoyed our stay.
December 2011,Simply the best hotel we have ever stayed in,"This is a very beautiful hotel, wonderfully situated and really quite perfect.  Every single member of staff made us feel very welcome, and all the little touches that set this hotel apart were very much appreciated.  I would recommend The Milestone without hesitation, and cannot wait to return and stay a little longer; one night was not enough!"
December 2011,Superb Hotel!,"My husband and I decided to visit this hotel for our 2nd Wedding Anniversary on 26th December based on trip advisor reviews and we were not dissappointed.  It is in a perfect location close to high street Kensington shops and Hyde Park.    On arrival we checked in and were shown to our room, we stayed in room 206.  The room was beautiful and there was a bottle of champagne waiting for us in our room and an anniversary card.  The room was beautifully decorated and I could not fault it at all.  The service was fantastic.  We parked in a public car park opposite which was ¬£30 for 24 hours, very secure parking and only a short walk from the hotel.   We had afternoon tea which I would highly recommend, the sandwiches, cakes and warm scones were lovely and we were unable to finish‚Ä¶"
December 2011,"Front of house rather snooty and preoccupied Great breakfast, poor dinner","Imaginatively designed and decorated room and impressive balcony. Well equipped too with superb toiletries towelling etc. Very good breakfasts indeed! But dinner was a letdown, but then there were no other dinners. First course skate - very good. Poorly presented Kobe steak (? Was it Kobe?). Ghastly desert in a roll of jelly and glutinous custard. Charming waiting though"
December 2011,Milestone Hotel - Excellent hotel with 5* service 24/7,On arrival at the Milestone we were greeted by very friendly concierge staff who quickly organised our rooms and luggage. The junior suite had excellent taste and decor. The rooms had everything to make our stay comfitable.

December 2011,WAU but.....,"The Milestone truly is a very nice and chique hotel and the service is nice and the rooms indeed very cozy - i have booked a junior suite and i have to say one thing.... for the price its quite normal you can offer a good service and a nice room - so NO surprise at all instead of that i got a quite normal good service and a quite normal nice room - so value money/value is ok but surely not WAU ! Have been in many hotels in asia/europe/america and got that service (without the small special extras like candles in the bathroom) for a total different price - off course its london ! but but but.... a junior suite where you can't watch tv in your bed (venetian suite)  is quite ""special"", a suite whitout a view anywhere than the court is special again for the price and a suite where‚Ä¶"
December 2011,Wonderful hotel with exceptional service,"We recently had a wonderful family stay at The Milestone Hotel last weekend to celebrate a family birthday party. We were a large party and were accommodated well and even received some complimentary upgrades within our group. On arrival we were met by the very friendly concierge staff who kindly whisked our car away to a local NCP carpark and took our luggage into the hotel to make the arrival extremely seamless. The service in the hotel was very personal and various members of staff stood out as being very genuine and very happy to help, where possible. The rooms were all very individual and included many beautiful and personal touches. The complimentary beauty products in the room were a lovely surprise and you really felt very spoilt and pampered.  I asked for some coffee‚Ä¶"
December 2011,The best hotel experience ever!,"We spent a weekend at The Milestone this December, and due to the ranking of Tripadvisor our expectations were high.The hotel met our expectations by miles- it was great in every way: The room was wonderful, the food delicious, and the staff exellent- they really make you feel welcome and special. The atmosphere at this hotel is special and calm- a place to relax. We had an memorable celebration of our anniversary- the Milestone made it perfect!We will be back and recommend the hotel to everyone who wants to have a delightful stay in London!"
November 2011,Exellent,"My wife and I have just returned home after spending a fantastic weekend at The Milestone. From the moment you walk in you get a level of service that we have never experiensed before at any other hotel. And it lasted until the moment we left. We stayed in a junior suite and it was amazing. We are not able to point out one negative experiense from our stay so the next time we go to London we will not spend time looking for alternatives, we will stay at The Milestone."
October 2011,Very English,"The hotel was a good 5* experience but we did not like the smallness of the old English style of the hotel. Our junior suite was smaller than executive rooms in most 5* hotels that we normally stay in. Thus the value for money satisfaction was not there. On Sunday morning the breakfast was also slow and the service inadequate, mostly because the whole restaurant had only two waitors."
May 2011,The best hotel in the best city in the world,"Have been at The Milestone Hotel was one of the best experiences of my life, the attention of the staff is excellent, went to celebrate my birthday but my astonishment surpassed expectation, the best service, my room more beautiful and comfortable, wonderful!, food, first and delicious, the ability to read the newspaper to the fireplace makes The Milestone Hotel is just a warm place, a place where one can feel much better than in our own home.  I have only words of thanks for the wonderful days spent in London at the best hotel in the best city in the world!"
September 2011,Beautiful Hotel:,"I stayed with Friends at the Milestone Hotel and we all had just the most wonderful experience of""English Hospitality"" The rooms are magnificent, Food  is delicious and the Staff are just amazing....absolutely the best. We all felt so special and any help we needed with trips,directions etc was attended to in a most helpful manner.  We all hope to return to the Milestone again."
July 2011,My wife and I loved it all!!!,"Our trip from Sept-4 to 7th I have been to Europe several times but this was my first trio with my wife. It is difficult to pick the first hotel of your stay because you want it to be memorable. After reading all the ratings we settled on the Milestone. It is in a great location, you can walk, take the bus or the train conveniently to any location. The breakfast was excellent and we found the staff extremely accommodating. Diner was the best meal we had in 15 days in Europe with the exception of Guy Savoy in Paris. We had the special 7 course sampler the food was excellent and the atmosphere and banter with the staff was fun. We were in the safari suite which was fantastic.  The Concierge services were right on point and very helpful. The front desk staff was pleasant in every‚Ä¶"
September 2011,Tops!!!!,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Milestone.  Perfect location. The staff was warm, friendly and they all had a wonderful sense of humor. We hope to return someday. "
May 2011,Consistently Outstanding,"Our second visit to the Milestone.  I can't say enough about how good this hotel is.  Neil, the Assistant Concierge is amazing.  He goes above and beyond to be sure guests are well taken care of.  Everyone else on the staff is totally guest focused.  Pedro and Graham were delightful.  Our dinner at Chenestons was perfect.  The room was lovely and well appointed.  We will be back again!"
August 2011,Did it live up to my high expectations?  YES !,The staff are very attentive and are highly skilled at what they do. The staff obviously care about the level of service they are providing which is pleasing. That said if you are like me and do not like too much fuss I found them generally perceptive to this. The rooms are lavish and extremely clean. The food in restaurants is excellent as you would expect. Without going into the realms of fantasy about the place I have to say it surpassed my expectations. We had one hiccup during our stay and that was over a breakfast we had requested in our room by way of leaving a notice detailing our order on the door handle. When the allotted time came..no breakfast! I phoned reception to be informed they had not received the order. They were mortified and by the time we ventured‚Ä¶
June 2011,"Not perfect,but close",We normally have stayed in some pretty good London hotels but wanted a change.....and how pleasantly surprised I and my fellow guests were. The management and staff do care and understand who paying their wages. Hope they never forget and keep up the good work...this way they'll keep being head and shoulders above the rest.
August 2011,The warmest welcome I have ever had in London,"we stayed at the Milestone in June 2011, on the final sector of a round-the-world trip.  We had come from Washington DC, where the staff of the hotel had earned a letter from me to the Manager because of their condescending and dismissive attitude.  Coming after this, the Milestone could not have been more of a contrast, and such a welcome contrast at that.  We were greeted very warmly, and shown to our room by the butler, who seemed genuinely concerned that we be truly delighted with our room.  He rang back 15 minutes after he had left, just to be certain. shortly after that, Tea was delivered to our room.  The restaurant was very good, and wine-matching from the excellent cellar was exemplary.    This hotel's greatest asset is the happy, interested and genuinely joyful vibe‚Ä¶"
September 2011,Beyond expectations - the only place we will stay in London!,"From the minute you arrive, the staff cannot do enough for you. Our room was spacious and well appointed. Excellent breakfast and afternoon tea. The location overlooking Kensington Gardens was beautiful."
August 2011,"Personal welcome, beautiful and comfortable - we'll be back!","From the friendly welcome at reception and personal attention from the butler who showed up our room, to the handwritten welcome letter from the hotel general manager (and biscuits!) waiting in the room. Every detail to make your stay comfortable has been thought through. the room had real wow factor - upholstered wallpaper, 1920's accessories combined with countryhouse chic furnishings.  The hotel room was fully kitted out like a small apartment - very convenient of packing light ofr a business or leisure visit to London.  We were there for one night only - was situated perfectly for walking to the Proms that night at the Royal Albert Hall. Thing I liked least was the small bathroom. Though luxuriously furnished, it was a tight squeeze to get round the door to the facilities. A‚Ä¶"
August 2011,Perfect in every way,"Our family experience here was perfect in every way.  We traveled with our young son and were welcomed, charmed and left wanting to come back again and again."
July 2011,A Very Happy Birthday for Me,"Pure hedonism lots of lovely little touches. The service was superb and friendly. Marcus the cocktail steward made the meanest dirty gin martinis. A lovely way to celebrate my ""milestone"" birthday."
August 2011,We enjoyed our test stay,It was really a good experience staying at your hotel. One of the best service I have ever experienced. Jojo
August 2011,Why stay anywhere else if you wish to stay in the Kensington area when in London!,"Rightfully recognised as one of the world's top flight hotels The Milestone continues to delight and deliver. Rightfully it comes down to the staff. Nothing is too much trouble and it is delivered with a pleasant professionalism with no accompanying dramas. This is quality that The Milestone delivers consistently well. Marcus the barman in The Stables Bar produces Dry Martinis of the highest and dryest styles that easily equal those of The Savoy and The Stafford.  If the corporate budget accommodates, opt for one of the beautifully appointed, private entrance apartments that offer the facility for personally produced dining or the more easily accessed services of the hotel itself. If a landmark celebration is on your calendar then just contact Catherine Chandler who will see to‚Ä¶"
July 2011,One of the best hotels in the world,"I am a regular guest of the Milestone Hotel. I have been for about 7 years now. I recently stayed there again for work and pleasure, and the Milestone remains one of the best hotels in any category, anywhere in the world. The service is incredible. Yet you feel you are at home. There is nothing stuffy or formal about the hotel.   The concierge desk with Jim, Neil and Jose is fantastic. The location can't be beat with Kensington Park right outside the door. The little gym is lovely and their is a tiny spa if you want to indulge. The English breakfast is fantastic and the bar areas lovely.  The Milestone has the services of a five star hotel with the intimate feel of a boutique hotel or even huge townhouse home.   It is also quintessentially British which is lovely.  A British‚Ä¶"
July 2011,Resting on Laurels...,"Stayed here recently in an upgraded suite based largely on trip advisor recommendations. The location is quite good and the maid staff was quite attentive. However there were a lot of little things that added up to a less than stellar experience. We were given a room where you could barely walk around the bed and the shower you had to watch your head. Also, on our welcome tour from our butler essentially we were told if we needed anything to talk to the concierge. Didn,t see our supposed butler for the remainder. The setting of the hotel is quite stuffy including the bar which is admittedly quite quaint. Little things like spiders in the hallway and doormen who were rarely at the door were minor annoyances also.    All in all, if you like things ver formal and can get the place‚Ä¶"
July 2011,You simply can't find a more wonderful place to stay,"Whenever we return to our beloved London, where we we fortunate enough to live for four years, we stay at The Milestone. It's perfectly situated in our former Kensington neighborhood but the most important reason we continue to choose this gem of a hotel is that it's quite simply the most welcoming, comfortable and charming home-away-from-home one could imagine. It's elegant without being stuffy. Each and every member of the staff is outstanding. We're always sad to leave and always look forward to our next visit. You'll love it!"
July 2011,Really lovely - charming hotel with great service,"We travel a great deal and have not, until now, found a hotel we truly like in London.  This is a relatively small hotel, but with superb service and a lovely setting.  Although not inexpensive, the rate included breakfast and tea on the first day (which was far better than tea at the Plaza in New York).  The location is excellent, the common areas really lovely, and the room, although not large, was outstanding.  They have thought of every possible detail that you want in a hotel room - from an unobtrusive night light so that you can make your way to the bathroom in the dark, to beautiful linens, to a useful work area with good connectivity.  Bravo to the designer.  We will be back!"
June 2011,The best hotel in London. By a Londoner.,I have stayed in the Milestone many times including the night before my wedding. (now divorced!) The rooms are mostly amazing and the staff always try to upgrade you wherever possible. Im almost certain that there is no other hotel in London that has terraces attached to rooms without upgrading to a huge suite like the Milestone does. I may have just been very lucky in the past though. I konw that alot of the clientele that frequent the Milestone are Americans looking for a slice of England and so that can make the hotel a cliche. I have lived in NYC and am a London native and it is still my hotel of choice. I locked myself out of my apartment last week. I told the taxi to take me straight to the Milestone at 2.30am! They looked up my details on the computer and arranged a great‚Ä¶
July 2011,WOW,"We hadn't been to London for many a year and had the opportunity to go to see Strictly Gershwin at The Royal Albert Hall, so The Milestone proved to be a perfect location for an evening stroll to RAH.    From the moment we arrived it was like an oasis in the busy City, and being opposite Kensington Park was a great bonus to be able to get away from the hustle and bustle of London for a while.  We were greeted with a welcome drink on arrival and given a tour of the hotel and then shown to our upgraded room.  The Hotel really is out of this world and something one can only dream of finding in London, but it really is there.  Service is excellent but unobtrusive, all the staff are polite and helpful and the food is fantastic.  The hotel has such a tranquil ambience from the moment‚Ä¶"
July 2011,Wonderful hotel experience,A recent stay at The Milestone Hotel in London was letter perfect.  The facilities are first class and beautifully maintained.  The staff gets top ratings for both competence and professionalism.  This gem is a home away from home.
July 2011,On a scale of 1-10 we give it an 11!,"I do not even know where to start.  We stayed at the Milestone through the American Express Platinum Fine Hotels Program.  I can only start out by saying, we have traveled all over and have never experienced anything as wonderful as the Milestone.    We arrived many hours before check in time, and our room was not ready.  We received a wonderful upgrade as part of the American Express Program and breakfast each morning, and a free lunch or dinner.  We were given a tour of the hotel, and immediately felt welcomed and for lack of a better description wowed!    We stored our luggage and when we returned, our room was ready and our luggage waiting for us there.  We loved our room, a nice size, comfortable bed, no real view, but quiet.  The shower and bathtub, were a little confusing‚Ä¶"
June 2011,Favorite London Boutique Hotel,"Super-clean! Awesome staff! The recently re-done Tudor Suite is amazing! Loved Neil-the concierge-super helpful and a positive disposition, meeting Andrew-the GM and Steph-F&B Mgr at a happy hour: great guys! The housekeepers were the best-so discreet, never intruded + great turndown service. I love coming back to The Milestone (unlike No. 11 last year). Hoping to return soon and could easily stay longer than the 5 nights we did stay!"
June 2011,One of the most oustanding hotels we have ever been to,The milestone hotel was one of the best experience I have ever had as a traveler.. We went to London to go to wimbledon and this was over the top... We had 2 butlers and the concierge was amazing.  The room was beautiflul clean and ohhh so comfortable...  The food was yummy!! The service was impecable.  We Highly recommend this little piece of heaven.
June 2011,Great Stay at the Milestone,"Our first time in London and we couldn't have picked a better spot to stay.  Kensington is lovely and the Milestone is a great location in Kensington.  The staff prides itself on making your stay enjoyable -- and they succeeded.  We booked through the American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts Program -- well worth it.  We did not receive the room upgrade (as is possible when booking with AMEX FHR -- we actually had a small room), but the hotel made up for this by providing us a free valuable dinner at their high quality restaurant.  They did not need to do this, but offered this to us.  Dining in London is really expensive for Americans, so we certainly appreciated the offer. Breakfast as part of FHR  at the Milestone was available via room service for no extra charge --‚Ä¶"
May 2011,I wouldn't stay anywhere else in London,"I occasionally have the opportunity to stop in London for business and when doing so like to take some time to enjoy London.   The Milestone is the perfect place for both.      The location has good access for taxi's and drivers and also close to the London underground.  Located just off Kensington High Street there is lots of shopping close by, Portobello Market is walking distance , and Hyde Park is just accross the street for a relaxing walk or morning run.  Royal Albert Hall is only a few blocks down the street as well as a number of must see museums - Natural History, Kensington Palace  and the Victoria and Albert.  The hotel itself is fabulous.   Each room is different (I have visited five times now and look forward to the next)... all are nicely decorated, and truly make‚Ä¶"
June 2011,good service and nice hotel,The hotel it is located in a nice area of London-was my firt time in South Kensington In the beginning I had a room without view not so nice but after I please the reception to change the room.I had some difficulties but finally they gave me a very nice Junior suite-Paris -very charming and located to the last floor with a very nice vue to the park Breakfast was very nice-if and if the english breakfast was included in the price of the room the continental one was enough for me.I had also the afternoon tea in the hotel-also nice/ Despite to same dificulties in the beginning finally was a very nice stay. mm1118
June 2011,Excellent service!,The hotel is beautifully decorated and the staff are first rate. The food was delicious. It was a fabulous place to stay.
September 2010,Like a guest on a country estate,"Living at the Milestone hotel feels like being a guest of honour at a country estate. It is a small hotel and you d. not stay there if you want to be anonymous. They remember your name and are genuinely concerned to put their guests at the centre of attention. The personnel are polite, but present and fun to talk to.  The interior is sumptuous and beautiful, with heavy curtains and covered walls in beautifull, clear colours. A lot of the guests are American and many have been here before. This not difficult to notice as the staff remember them and are carefull to use their names. This is clearly a place where many people feel very comfortable. The rooms are well-equiped with PC, DVD and iPhone cradles (?) plus a selection of magazines chosen with you in mind. If you feel like a‚Ä¶"
December 2010,Best Hotel in London,"The Milestone may be the best hotel in London. Yes, it is pricey, but well worth the expense. From the moment you enter the lobby, where the welcoming staff make you feel right at home, to the formal tea you may take in the drawing room, the Milestone delivers. No detail is too small. Rooms are elegantly appointed, comfortable, and a cut above. This stay was our third, and we have never been disappointed."
May 2011,Not the best but very nice,"Milestone is a very nice hotel at a beautiful area. It may not be the best hotel I have ever stayed, but it is a nice place to stay for a few days for a short break in London"
May 2011,We loved it and plan a return visit as soon as we can!!,The Milestone Hotel is the finest hotel we have ever visited. My husband and I are ardent travelers and have been all over the world and will be happy to re-visit the staff at the Milestone Hotel whenever we will be in London. We felt very much at home and felt sad to say good-bye.
June 2011,What you would expect a British Hotel to be - AMAZING!,"We initially booked this hotel because our main priority was to stay within walking distance of the Royal Albert Hall.  My goodness,  we were not expecting it to be so amazing.  The front desk staff are probably the most polite and helpful I have ever come across, and I am fairly well travelled.  They are incredibly ""proper and british"" which added to the ambience of the hotel.  Nothing was too much trouble and you were treated like Royalty.  They remembered your name every time they saw you which I thought was a very nice touch.   We were given a guided tour of the hotel when we first arrived and then a complimentary glass of champagne.    The room was beautifully decorated and the bed was heavenly.  We felt as though we had discovered a goldmine with this hotel and will find‚Ä¶"
May 2011,MORE LIKE A COUNTRY HOUSE WEEKEND THAN A LONDON HOTEL,"Regarding our recent five day stay at the Milestone, we can only say that we feel that the Management have got the balance just right. Its a difficult trick to pull off but the staff were efficient whilst being genuinely helpful and friendly. More like a country house weekend than a city centre hotel. It is something we have become used to in the more relaxed setting of Bushman's Kloof (the Groups Wilderness Reserve in the mountains of the Cederberg in the Western Cape) - so a well done to the staff at the Milestone.     We wanted to stay at the Milestone as a special treat when we came to London to see family from South Africa as it was my 65th birthday. We have stayed at other hotels in the Red Carnation Group namely Bushman's Kloof and Twelve Apostles in Capetown but what we‚Ä¶"
May 2011,Absolutely wonderful experience,The Milestone met our expectations and exceeded them in every way. The service was outstanding and the staff could not have been more friendly. From the minute we arrived we were greeted warmly and personably. Thank you for a wonderful experience.
May 2011,A beautiful Hotel with impeccable service,"Having been to London several times before, I researched a number of potential Hotels for our stay. The Milestone was chosen based on the positive reviews on Tripadvisor. We stayed for 7 days during the middle of the month. We booked a Deluxe Studio room and upon check in, we were upgraded to a suite. This was an especially lovely gesture on the part of the Milestone. Many Hotels pretend to be 5 star plus and have all the usual superlatives about staff and service yet usually fall down on the most important item - Service. This is where the Milestone excels - the service is outstanding. It appears the staff actually enjoy their jobs and are interested in ensuring the guests have a wonderful stay. From the Concierge and his staff (every day they were helpful with directions and‚Ä¶"
May 2011,Royal treat,"My wife and I stayed four nights in the Milestone Hotel. From the moment we arrived we had the best treat we ever had in Europe. Everything was beyond our expectation despite all the great reviews we already read in trip advisor. Location is very central, near to underground, Hyde park, Nothing Hill, Museums, great restaurants and shopping district (in particular Harrods). Everyone in the Hotel is so friendly, professional and courteous that make you feel like staying in your own home with special service. We're upgraded to a studio room which was spectacular with all kinds  of in room amenities you could imagine. We had a bottle of champagne in the room with a beautiful card for my wife's birthday which really appreciated and portrayed the thoughtfulness of the management. I‚Ä¶"
May 2011,"Sincere, first class service in elegant Victorian-era surroundings","We just spent 4 days at The Milestone and can't conjure enough superlatives to do the property and its fantastic staff justice.  From the blooming flowers, cloud-like bed and large, marble bath (with loads of Penhaligon toiletries) in our roomy suite to the superb, gracious personal service from the front desk (Stephanie and Alexandra), concierge (2 equally helpful gentlemen), doorman (Danny and another gentleman whose name escapes me now), butler (Francis), housekeeping (thank you for the turn-down service, canap√©s, bottled water and chocolates), restaurant (thanks, Jack and 2 other colleagues for serving such memorable English breakfasts) and spa (thanks again, Fiona!) we were wowed and have found our home away from home in London.  The Milestone is located just across from‚Ä¶"
May 2011,"Luxurious London, pampered perfection!","My wife and I stayed for one night as part of a trip to an event at The Royal Albert Hall, (just 5 mins walk down the road). From the minute we arrived we were treated like royalty by the team. The hotel is luxurious and intimate, our room was beautiful and the Afternoon Tea... wow! To Fran and the rest of the amazing staff... thank you, thank you, thank you, and much like Eric Clapton at the RAH... we will be back!"
May 2011,Like a private club,"I've just completed a weekend at the Milestone. All I have to say is perfect. It is very different from other 5 stars hotels I've stayed at and that's what makes the Milestone pretty unique.To the busy, pristine and sometimes cold and impersonal ultra-luxury-wow-factor, the Milestone gives you cosiness, personal touches, and the surprises of the unexpected.  It feels like being in a private club you're a member of from year for every single staff seems to know you and call you by your name. Everybody's so nice.  Every room is different; I don't only talk about the bedrooms but also the lobby, the lounge, the bar, the restaurant. For instance, having a drink at the bar is like going back in time and being in an BBC ""the Avengers"" episode. Staying at the Milestone is like staying‚Ä¶"
May 2011,Wonderful treat even for Londoners,"My fiancee planned a night at the Milestone as a surprise. We live in London and usually go outside of the city and stay in a converted manor home or B&B but we always talk about staying in a quintessential London Hotel. We had an amazing evening. As the evening was a complete surprise, the staff were very helpful arranging everything for him. When we returned from dinner there was a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us----without him even asking. The hotel is also just a short walk from our favorite restaurant, The Launceston Place----amazing food, service, and romantic atmosphere. The next morning was followed by breakfast in bed and champagne. We took a leisurely stroll through the park following breakfast before we returned home.  Although we‚Ä¶"
April 2011,Best personal service hotel,"Just spent 8 days at Milestone, they have 5 apartments if you want to stay over a week, with kitchens and living rooms.  The hotel is traditional english, rooms are small, ditto bathrooms but very pretty and each unique.  Service from the moment you walk in is over the top, they call you by name, no question stumps the Concierge (best one is Jose), but everyone from waiters to housekeepers are fabulous.  Its expensive, for sure, but worth every minute. Location across from Kensington Park and Palace make it more homey feeling.  Be aware, all of London is under construction in anticipation of the 2012 Olympics"
April 2011,Could easily move into the Milestone Hotel,"We stayed at the Milestone after a ghastly experience at another hotel. What a pleasure it was to meet the staff at the Milestone, enjoy the beautiful lobby, and relax in our gorgeously appointed room with a view of the park. Every detail is extremely elegant and well thought-through, and the bathrooms were tastefully done with top of the line fixtures. Also, the location (right across from Hyde Park) really couldn't be beat. My many thanks to Stephanie, Neil, and the entire staff at the Milestone for making our stay so memorable."
March 2011,Wonderful from start to finish!,"My husband and I just returned from a 5 night stay at the Milestone and it was a truly wonderful experience.  I agonized over where to stay in London and we had pretty much every option, but I am so glad we chose the Milestone.  Others have written about the top notch service and I totally agree.  Our experience started as soon as we arrived in London.  We opted to have the hotel provide transportation from Heathrow.  It was a bit more expensive than a taxi but so worth it to have the delightful Colin greet us after a long flight and even take us on a little tour before taking us to the hotel.  What a great way to start our vacation.  Everyone on staff was genuinely interested in making sure we were enjoying ourselves and had everything we needed (thanks Neil, Pedro and Marcus!)‚Ä¶"
May 2010,A top quality hotel,"I stayed at The Milestone Hotel in Mid March for the weekend as the base for my wedding in Hammersmith along with my family and a friend.  As soon as I arrived at the hotel the staff were charming, helpful and friendly. I was lucky enough to be staying in the beautiful Regency Suite and even though I had people turning up to do our hair and makeup,  the staff didn't stop being helpful and kind. My husband and I then stayed for our wedding night and again felt spoilt and had a lovely breakfast in the suite the next morning. A beautiful hotel, in a perfect location, great staff and a personal touch.  Thank you for helping to make our wedding weekend special."
March 2011,Very english hotel in great location,"My husband and I stayed at the Milestone hotel in the summer of 2010.  The hotel's location is fabulous and we had a great time.  High Street Kensington is just a few steps away in one direction, and Knightbridge is a short taxi or bus ride in the other direction.  Hyde Park is just across the street, which was great for morning jogs.  We both lived in London for years and know the city well, and this really is a great location to stay.  The hotel itself is very charming and quaint.  The decor is very old-fashioned english, very London.  Our room was very cute, but the bathroom felt a bit too old, and our sink was partly blocked.  Service was good, but I wouldn't say it was the best we ever experienced, and I'm surprised everyone else found it so amazing.  No complaints, but‚Ä¶"
March 2011,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Service","Beautiful hotel, great location and very friendly helpful staff.  We stayed in this hotel as part of a wedding party and the people couldn't do enough.  The hotel and rooms were very clean and service was great.  would definitely recommend it."
March 2011,London luxury at it's best,"We stayed at the Milestone for about a week and a half this March in an Apartment which for London was extraordinarily spacious. It consisted of two bedrooms, two full bathrooms, a living room and a kitchen. It also included all the facilities of the hotel.  	Having stayed at most of the Five star properties in London throughout my life. I have found the level of service and attention to detail in both design and comfort that the Milestone provides, to be the best in London.  	They consistently keep a record of guest preferences and in my opinion have the best guest services team. They are one of the few remaining hotels that I can find that not only provides round the clock complimentary butler service but also has in-house chauffeurs at affordable rates compared to comparable‚Ä¶"
February 2011,"Wonderful hotel with great, personal service!","Our family recently stayed at the milestone and had two hotel rooms.  The rooms were beautifully decorated, as were all the common rooms in the hotel.  The staff were very helpful in meeting any of our needs.  The hotel is well located.  We will return!"
March 2011,Great location and service,"We stayed here for three nights over valentines weekend.  Was a fantastic stay, the location was great for getting out and about in London.  Close to knightsbridge and the museums.  The staff were fantastic from the moment we arrived, I think all hoteliers should stay here for a lesson on how it should be done!  We were upgraded to the Safari suite which we liked although I do think it may soon be in need of some refurbishment as was starting to look a little tired.  However it was large and spotlessly clean with a lovely view to Kensington Palace.  I loved the little evening treats of canapes and chocolates in the room.  Our romantic turndown was good although no music was put on.  Not quite sure why they ask for music preferences as it did not appear that music was provided so‚Ä¶"
March 2011,"Fantastic service, beautiful rooms, staff can't do enough for you!",I stayed in the Milestone for my sister's wedding. It was a beautiful hotel. A lovely breakfast and charming atmosphere in the bar at night time.The staff were so friendly and helpful. The service was 5 star. The best hotel I've stayed in!
March 2011,Great place to stay,Very Nice place to stay for business or leisure. Th√© staf is wonderful and the service... Just perfect. Will make it again. K
March 2011,Superb service and quality standards,first class attention from first phone call  (to check parking arrangements) over a two night stay to leaving ; the quality of rooms and ambience was above expectations. I stayed for two nights with my wife ; three grown up daughters and a friend of theirs . the occasion was my eldest daughter's wedding on the saturday ; the atmosphere and professionalism of staff gave us the perfect start to our big day ; I would definitely return ; happy to pay a bit more to get this level of satisfaction.
March 2011,"Excellent hotel, staff and service","First time at this hotel normally stay at the Waldoff but must say this has now become my favourite hotel in London, Hotel perfect, food excellent and staff are great, well worth a visit for a quality break, Keep up the good work Milestone"
March 2011,Great London 5 star vanuit experience!,"From the helpfull staff, to the high standard of the room and all the thoughtfull details, f.i. the decoration of the room and penhaligon toiletries, the perfect smoked salmon and eggs benedict at Cheneston's,it is all an experience of √† lifetime.Thank you all staff for √† birthdaytrip to remember."
March 2011,Like Coming Home,"I spent 2 nights in February '11 and 3 nights in March '11 at the Milestone Hotel across from Kensington Park in London on the recommendation of my travel agent.  I was greeted by name so warmly upon arrival that I thought the staff mistakenly thought I'd been there before.  Each room was different and delightfully decorated.  The restaurant in the hotel, Cheneston's, was excellent.  Service was gracious and efficient in every aspect, from the bar and restaurant to Reception and Concierge service.  In short, it felt like coming home.  As I told my travel agent after the trip, ""I can never return to London without staying at the Milestone."""
February 2011,Fantastic Service,"I stay in London alot and have tried various hotels, never feeling the need to write a review on here as many were nice but with at best indifferent service. The Milestone is different, the staff were incredibly attentive and helpful and everything went smoothly from the minute I checked in to the minute I left. Just as a small example, I am a keen long distance runner and went for a run when I got up; when I got back an hour later the Doorman had a towel and bottle of water waiting for me. Its little touches of initiative like this that I think really make a difference."
February 2011,Simply the Best 5* Experience Ever,"We visited London w/end of 26th February to see Madam Butterfly at the Albert Hall so were looking for a hotel within easy walking distance that my arthritic knees could cope with! The Milestone is only a 10min easy walk away. It looked really wonderful from the pictures on their web site & what you see is really what you get in this case. We were going to travel down by train but due to the 'demise' of The Wreham & Shropshire' railway just a few weeks befoer our visit (after going into panic mode) we decided to travel by car. The hotel staff were superb & said just park outside & then one of their fully insured doormen would drive the car to secure car parking a short distance away,it cost ¬£35-00 but was well worth it. That was such a relief for us, being 'country bumkins'. As‚Ä¶"
February 2011,Quite simply the best!,The best service we have ever received. The amazing staff at this hotel have a unique way of making you feel that you are the most important guest that has ever stayed. Our children loved every minute and did not want to leave. Exceeded our (very high!) expectations at every level. We have stayed in most of Londons top/famous hotels and not one of them comes close to the service and experience we had at The Milestone.
February 2011,Great charming hotel with great service,The room was fantastic! Room service was superb and they even have a pool and a fabulous masseuse named Fiona who gave one of the best massages I have ever had!!! I had a meeting and was late and the doorman got me a cab and the concierge was holding my Starbucks cappucino in his hand ready! I highly recommend the hotel.
February 2011,How Wonderful!,I've just returned from a really wonderful stay at The Milestone! Everything about the hotel is 100% five star.Service was beyond anything I've recieved anywhere else in the world. The people at The Milestone think of everything and then some. My room was beautiful and spotless. Turn down was really nice with different treats everynight. The staff from the front desk to the  housekeepers and everyone in between were lovely and very helpful. Don't miss this one when your in London. it's the place to stay!!!!!!!
November 2010,Made our children feel like royalty!,We had a fabulous stay at the Milestone. The staff were so helpful and the children had a wonderful time on their behind the scenes tour with Pedro. The children were made to feel so special with their own robes and slippers and a gift when they arrived. My daughter has several food allergies and the staff were all aware and very attentive. The chef was able to adapt his very exciting menu for her. The staff including Neil the manager and Stefan went out of their way to be friendly and welcoming. The rooms were an excellent size and we had an adjoing one for the children. We loved the resistance pool. We will definitely be returning.
January 2011,Beautiful small Hotel with very friendly staff,Staying at the Milstone Hotel was a marvelous experience. The personnel was extremely friendly and the service was excellent. We felt at home immediately.
October 2010,Attentive staff made the experience outstanding,"This was our first stay at the Milestone and it has become our new favourite London hotel. The team were warm and ever-helpful with suggestions and nothing was too much trouble, from our use of the Bentley and driver for a very British experience, to the off-menu breakfast requests at Chenestons where we also enjoyed a superb dinner on the night before departure. The room was quiet, handsomely furnished, spotless, surprisingly spacious for a London room, and well provisioned with tasty treats and quality toiletries. The public spaces did not suffer from the sterility or pretentiousness of some other hotels so we actually sat in the lounge to read the newspapers after breakfast. The very personal experience of this small hotel and its attentive staff has won us over."
December 2010,Incredible hotel and accomodations,When my wife and I arrived in the afternoon we were greeted immediately and politely escorted to the front desk.  They greeted us by name and had a room ready...unfortunately it wasn't the type of room we anticipated and I asked they check again and after a few minutes they upgraded us to wonderful suite.  The staff was absolutely terrific and attentive.  The food at the restaurant was excellent and at tea time you couldn't ask for a better traditional experience.  The location in Kensington was marvelous.  This is a gem of a hotel.
January 2011,"Simply the best hotel experience you can imagine, home from home and more.","This is the fifth time we have stayed at the Milestone and with every visit it just gets better. The hotel enjoys a fantastic location, ask for a room overlooking the park. The staff are very attentive and greet all guests by name. Neil Anderson, guest services manager is an absolute professional. We had afternoon tea in the Park Lounge and next day had dinner in the Chenestons Restaurant, both are worthy of high praise. The rooms are all very well appointed and we've now stayed in a few of them including the truly amazing Prince Albert Suite, not cheap but very much worth it. We will certainly return to this amazing hotel. You will not be disappointed."
January 2011,"It was really nice, we spend a really good time, the personnal was very friendly","Well located, tipicaly english, with a warm welcome."
December 2010,Probably the Best Service in a London Hotel,"Due to the closure of Heathrow over the holiday period we found ourselves with a couple of extra days in London.  We booked The Milestone not really having any expectations really.   After several days in the Arctic temperatures of my Mother's house all I knew is that I wanted somewhere warm!  Well, even before we arrived the service was amazing.  The concierge went out of his way to help my husband to return our rental car and answer all of his questions.  From the minute we arrived we were treated with courtesy and respect by all members of staff.  Nothing was too much trouble.    We were upgraded to a studio room as our original room was not ready.  In response to the people who say that the rooms at this hotel are small - well, this is a very old building, in  a country not‚Ä¶"
July 2010,Perfect British Experience,"I stayed at the hotel for three nights, including Chritmas Eve, with my extended family, including three teenagers.  The hotel itself is lovely - an old mansion with lots of British atmosphere.  The lobby, tea room (with roaring fire) and bar are quintessentially British.  The rooms and baths are adequate in size and furnished beautifully.  But, the service was the real standout.  The staff pays attention to every detail and no request seems to be too much for them to accommodate."
December 2010,A lovely hotel in need of a good restaurant.,"A beautiful hotel in a lovely situation with very helpful staff. However the standard of food has deteriorated. The menu is a bizarre combination of dishes. I have eaten there regularly for the last ten years but as it is the nearest to us, keep returning in the hope that things have changed. Sadly this is not happening and this has now been abandoned.  Please complain when your food is of poor quality, cold or not what you expected."
December 2010,Christmas at the Milestone - Awesome!!!!!!!,"I have never posted on a travel website before but feel compelled to compliment The Milestone Hotel in London.  We have traveled extensively and typically stay in upscale hotels including our last trips to the Mandarin Oriental in Vegas, Atlantis in the Bahamas and Ritz Carltons all over the world.  I have to say we have received the best service during our stay at The Milestone of any hotel we have ever been to.  From the moment we walked in, every single person at the hotel knew the name of our family and greeted us as if we were their family.  We were checked into one of the apartments by the general manager himself.  I of course did not realize this until later after I had tipped him 5 pounds for showing us our rooms.  The apartment is a two story delight with a sitting room‚Ä¶"
February 2011,Most amazing experience at a hotel!,Stayed here for my birthday treat and felt special as soon as stepped through the door. The staff are amazingly attentive and will do anything to make sure you have a pleasant stay. Fiona in the spa gave my friends and i some wonderful treatments. If you think the rooms look beautiful i the pictures wait until you get inside. I cant wait to stay here again. I had a wonderful time!!!
February 2011,Can't wait to return to this amazing hotel,"My husband and I selected London as the destination where we wished to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary.  After much research we chose the Milestone Hotel and are so pleased that we did.  This is truly a lovely hotel with a wonderful staff.  Our entire experience greatly exceeded our expectations.  Our package included full English breakfast (very tasty and plentiful, charming and cheerful staff, cozy dining room) and private car transfer from Heathrow. Our delightful driver Colin took us on a little mini-tour before dropping us at the hotel, helping us to get our bearings.  Our lovely upgraded room was ready for us upon arrival.  On our second night at the Hotel we returned to our room after a show to find it decorated with candles and rose petals, with a bottle of‚Ä¶"
February 2011,Absolutely fabulous!,"My husband and I just returned after a weeklong stay at the Milestone. In a word, the experience was splendid! Let‚Äôs begin with the perfect setting ‚Äì across the street from gorgeous Kensington gardens, a stones throw from the Kensington High Street stop on the Circle Line of the tube, and within walking distance to fabulous restaurants. A few words about the staff who immediately understands your wants and desires ‚Äì Marcus could very well be the bartender of the year, Jim the concierge who never tires of meeting your every need, Teddy the hero who booked us a table at Il Portico where we were treated as part of the family, Neil the assistant manager who can make any guest feel at home at the Milestone. I could go on, but really you must just go and see for yourself."
February 2011,Fabulous hotel- felt totally spoilt!,"We picked this hotel after reviewing it on Tripadvisor- we were not let now! From the moment we walked in we received excellent service. We were shown around the hotel e.g. bar, dining areas, sauna etc. We were then taken to our room and shortly afterwards we received our commplimentary drinks ( which we had chosen previously on a form that they email to you). The room was lovely and we were not dissapointed- and we have stayed in 5 star htels around the world, inlcuding the Taj hotels in India.  They even went out of their way and supplied soya mlk for my husband , who is a vegan. The operations manager- Neil went out of his way to make our stay as comforatble as possible. Knowing that we were a vegetarian and vegan he even printed off details of a suitable restaurant for us. ‚Ä¶"
January 2011,Amazing Afternoon tea - Didnt want to leave!,"The Milestone Hotel is just fabulas and you can see why its No3 currently in London. It only has 90 odd rooms so is small and personal. The moment i walk through the door the service blew me away. The lovely, lounge, bar and conservatory really made you feel at home and didnt want to leave. The Afternoon tea was cheaper than the major names of hotels but in my opinion was better. Sandwiches were nice but the scones were the best i ever tasted. Great pastries and cakes also. All items and tea were filled up as much as you wanted. Staff couldnt be faulted and cant wait to return."
January 2011,Consistently Amazing,This is our 5th or 6th stay at this wonderful gem of a hotel.  Each time we stay it is captivating.  The rooms are amazing - we've been given a different one each time - and the staff are all wonderful.  If you are visiting the Albert Hall or V&A/Science?Natural History Museum there really is nowhere better in terms of location and experience.  And of course - harrods is just up the road too!
January 2011,Outrageouse Brilliant........The best of the best,"Entering our own palace is the only way to explain the excellent hotel, The Milestone. Ebvery detail is outstanding from the brillian concierge neil who knew all the attractions and really made it his mission to find wonderful outings my 8 year old daughter would enjoy.  Besides watching the football match with her and relaying scores....The staff is exceptional the friendliness and the ability to rememebr all names and likes dislikes and prefereneces.  Teh rooms are all different so no one will have the exact room, remember thisis a historical building....an old monestery...the antiques are fantastic and it is like visiting a museum every room has a touch of hominess and charm and character.

January 2011,Excellent!!!,"With ALL the very BEST comfort and service, in everything - in to the smallest details!!! We have travelled the world - and use to stay at the very best hotel - and this hotel was both very cozy and really nice with a lot of ""Home-feeling""!  Even before our visit - we received a ""personal wishing-list""from The Milestone -that asked us what we prefered and our choices of pillows and down-quilts, and ALL other wishes. And we did appreciate and really LOVED our cozy beatiful room - with really high comfort and a wonderful bed and a great view over the park! The service was excellent  and everything was really GREAT in to the smallest details! The staff were so KIND and wanted to full-fill every small wish we had! And even the kind breakfast-waitress knew our name, at once! We can‚Ä¶"
January 2011,Unique hotel with Great Location and Excellent Friendly service,"Hotel was everything we'd hoped for.All staff were very friendly and helpful.Rooms were all different and regardless of shape or size all offered the same quality. Perfect location with plenty of restaurants around the area.Excellent breakfast . We were a party of six 50 to 60 year olds, and found the only disappointment  was the dinner that evening .There was a selection from the A la Carte or Table D'ote menus.When asked if the Grills menu (which included steaks) was available we were told no.The food ,whilst good quality,was very Nouvelle Cuisine, lukewarm  and served on cold plates. One of our party chose the cod dish from the Table D'ote menu which was also very very salty (he probably should have sent it back but didn't). Whilst the restaurant itself was very pleasant and‚Ä¶"
November 2010,The Best service ever,"This was a birthday treat weekend for our daughter. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff who were helpful, kind and knowledgeable.  It was old fashioned service from a bygone era: discreet and helpful but not obsequious. The rooms were not huge but very, very comfortable and quiet: we looked out over Kensington gardens but didn't hear any traffic at all or any noise from other rooms. We dined in the restaurant (superb) and had a 'celebration' birthday tea - very Country House. This is not the cheapest option hotel in London but something that is perfect for a special event.  I would love to go back again."
October 2010,Words Cannot Describe...,"Absolutely beautiful hotel, a world away from my usual hectic schedule. Amazing view, amazing staff and quite literally is a small piece of heaven on earth. Made my week. Many thanks."
November 2010,Van and the Milestone a great combination,My partner arranged for us to see Van Morrison at the Royal Albert Hall. As the Milestone was close by and after seeing the other reviews we decided to stay there. We had a wonderful stay and the staff were very attentive and the room was lovely. Van was also great as always and next time he comes to the Royal Albert we are sure to stay at the Milestone.
October 2010,Top notch service from friendly staff,"Five of us stayed in an apartment for a week that had 2 bedrooms, 2.5 baths and a kitchen.  While still tight compared to American hotels, it was quite large compared to other alternatives we explored in London.  It was very well appointed, comfortable beds and clean.  Staff was exceptional with all very friendly and helpful.  The apartment was immaculate and was nicely appointed.  We would wholeheartedly recommend the Milestone and would definitely return there."
September 2010,Great Hotel in a great location,My wife and I came to London for 2 nights to see Van Morisson at The Royal Albert Hall and were recommended to stay at The Milestone as it was close by. We had a great stay. The room we had was beautiful and spacious and the little touches with the service they provide puts this hotel at the top of my list !!  We will be returning soon.
October 2010,The best hotel in London  ??,"We took our 13 year old Grand-daughter to London for 2 days. The Milestone was perfectly situated - we walked through the park to Buckingham Palace and went to the Royal Mews - then over to Kensington High St for Tea - back to the Hotel to change for the Last Night of the Proms,to which we walked,at the Royal Albert Hall.   Every time we went back to the Hotel the staff greeted us by name On arrival we had been upgraded from the standard room that we had booked to a fantastic suite ,with an adjoining sideroom for our Grand-daughter.Drinks and canapes arrived early evening and Ellie kept texting messages and pictures to her Parents and siblings. Wonderful rooms, incredible location and very special staff  -  we would reommend this hotel to you all."
April 2010,A small hotel with outstanding staff and amenities,"The Milestone has less than 60 rooms but what it lacks in size it makes up for in terms of accommodations and a superb staff.  Each room is decorated differently and all are wonderful.  The amenities for the room are outstanding.  The staff is most attentive and extraordinarily helpful.  At every level the service is as good as can be imagined.  Location in the Kensington area is excellent, with transportation and dining nearby.  All in all, the hotel is a jewel and worth a stay for anyone."
April 2010,Afternoon tea,"I arranged a surprise high tea for my Daughters Birthday. We had the conservatory for our party.This was ideal as we had a baby with us. The deco was excellent, the food and the service was superb.  Individual attention was given to our party and we felt so relax and felt very comfortable.  My daughter enjoyed her 30th Birthday surprise very much .  Thank you and your staff  for a very enjoyable afternoon"
October 2010,Excellent afternoon tea,I was given a nice surpise by my family for afternoon tea for my birthday. I was greeted at the front door and taken through to the conservatory where my family were waiting. The setting was spectacular and the service was impeccable. I was treated to a beautiful birthday cake made by the hotel which really topped my whole day off. I could not fault it!
August 2010,Wonderful hotel !!!,"Nice staff, great location, good restaurant. We hope to come back ....."
November 2009,We thought we heard john lennon!,"We heard ""love is a stranger"" by Brahman Kelleher, and i swear it reminded my of a johnny cash meets john lennon!  This hotel rocks! I like hotels who cater to a discerning ear! Service was top notch, a spot on value!  Highly recommended!"
April 2010,"Elegant, intimate, beautiful....","This is a beautiful luxury small hotel right in front of Kensington Palace with views over the park and 3 minutes from Kensington High Street. Excellent, discreet, personalised service and smiles from all the members of staff. Superb restaurant with knowledgeable wine waiter. The rooms are beautifully maintained and spotlessly clean. We have stayed here  twice and loved it. Definitely to be recommended."
June 2010,A True Delight,"Stayed in this Hotel back in April was was truly amazed. Had lived for many years in London and never heard of this particular gem.  Beautiful little hotel, with  outrageously good service. Would love to say I will stay again, however I own an apartment close by so will just need to ensure my friends stay there so I can return."
July 2010,The hotel you always hoped you would find in London,"A wonderful experience from start to finish.  We loved the look of the hotel when we drove up ---it's location is ideal -- and we were greeted warmly and professionally by the front door staff and the desk.  Our room was beautifully furnished, the dining room excellent, and the facilities and features of the hotel are all superb.   It's NOT modern --- it has wonderful, authentic, old world charm, but it is beautifully maintained.   Most of all the staff was uniformly polite, thoughtful, and they simply couldn't do enough to help you have a good stay.   I don't think we'll ever stay anywhere else."
July 2010,A quaint family hotel in London. Loved it.,"If your looking for a great boutique hotel that can offer some home-like amenities, this would be your place. My younger daughter travelled with me and she was instantly greeted with the friendliest staff.  We had an apartment that provided a full kitchen and laundry.  The breakfast was seriously the best I have had in London - great pancakes and waffles.  The neighborhood offers great shopping and easy access to transportation.  I can't wait to stay there again."
July 2010,"Nice, but a bit cramped","We had two rooms at the Milestone for four nights.  The staff was helpful, graciously overlooking the fact that my daughter threw up in the lobby within an hour of our arrival, the location across from the park, great, and the sound proofing of the rooms, excellent--I didn't hear any street traffic at night.  Accustomed as I am to small European hotel rooms, I felt particularly cramped at the Milestone, however.  There wasn't  space for two carry-on suit cases in the room and room service had to be eaten on a tray on the bed.  I prefer a bit more space.  We ate breakfast, which was very good, in our rooms because the dining room was quite small and we usually had to wait for a table."
July 2010,This hotel provided the best service we have experienced in many years.,"Not only was the service excellent, but the employees were so outgoing and friendly. One could tell the employees enjoyed their jobs and it showed in their contact with the customers (hotel guests). This certainly is a reflection of good management, selection of good emploees and proper training."
June 2010,First class hotel and excellent service,"I travel all over he world on business and at times have had to put up with some rather indifferent hotel rooms and service. However, the Milestone hotel in Kennsington, London was really quite special and for me, set a new standard in 5* treatment. The management team really seemed to appreciate the guest. The staff, room/food quality and overall location of the hotel was really excellent. Although it is a boutique hotel, the standards are extremely high and I will now always say there when travelling to London. Highly recommended."
July 2010,Treat Yourself To This Hotel,"We booked two nights at this hotel as it is an easy walk to the Albert Hall. This a small boutique hotel where you can feel safe and pampered. Our room, the African Suite had a safari theme which was delightful. The bed enormous, comfortable and the sheets to die for.  The room was a generous size and the service just right.    It was quite warm when we were there and so we appreciated the airconditioning. Wifi is available in the room.  Fresh fruit was waiting for us on arrival, small pieces of fruit and each one perfect. The breakfast is the best I have experienced in a hotel and I just wished I had enough money to move in permanently and have breakfast here every day of my life. I though the breakfasts in Manhattan were good but they still have something to learn from the‚Ä¶"
December 2009,I'm homesick for the Milestone,"I only stayed a week but made myself right at home.  The room was absolutely spotless however I would have enjoyed a better view. Upon request they changed the mattress to make it softer and gave me THE most comfortable pillow.  The bathroom literally sparkled.  While waiting for a taxi, the room maid waved hi to me and gave me the friendliest hello like she was my friend. Fiona at the spa is a doll and made me feel special and welcome. Location is amazing; Whole Foods and the Tube are a few steps away.  The hardworking Concierge got me all the theater tickets I wanted and knew the best restaurants in town; they were even able to get me reservations last minute.  One gentleman took the time to hand draw me a map, highlighted in yellow and everything to ensure I made it to my‚Ä¶"
July 2010,Fantastic Hotel,"I have stayed in the Milestone on three occasions,  twice on business and once with my young family.  The staff and service are unbeatable and made us feel very welcome.  Nothing is too much trouble and would recommend this hotel to anyone."
January 2010,great hotel!,"We stayed here for 2 nights following a Backroads cycling trip in Tuscany. My travel agent, recommended it. The hotel and hotel staff were awesome.  Comfy beds, large suite (we were upgraded, i have no idea why unless it was the AmEx platinum), clean, all sorts of useful items in the room like a normal blow dryer, scissors, tape etc...They brought snacks in the late afternoon, cold water, cookie or something sweet at night.  The concierge, who I had been emailing with for weeks before was great as well. Good location. We will stay here the next time we are in London."
December 2009,"Lovely hotel, very welcoming staff!","My partner and I stayed at the Milestone for New Year's Eve (thought we would treat ourselves).  Would just lke to say this is a great hotel to stay at if you want to experience how the other half live.  The rooms are luxurious and very comfortable with everything you would need and more!  The staff I think are one of the many things that make this hotel the best to stay at in Knightsbridge from welcoming you at the beginning of your staf until the minute you leave, for example when you arrive at the hotel you are given a tour of all the amenities in the hotel that are available to you by a very charming guide who is there to answer any questions you may have.  As we do not normally stay in hotels in the same class as this we were apprehensive about how we would fit in with‚Ä¶"
September 2009,We found our beautiful London home away from home....,"My family and I traveled to London for the Christmas holidays and to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday. After hours of research, I chose the Milestone Hotel for 6 nights. Everything about the hotel was warm and inviting.  The staff was friendly and helpful without being overbearing.  We had an apartment unit which was everything we could have hoped for and more.  The rooms were tastefully decorated and the beds were comfortable with glorious linens.  The bathrooms were beautiful as well.  We had a small issue with the heat in the sitting room and the maintenance person was there in minutes and even came back the next day just to check it again. The breakfasts were good with a wide selection.  One evening we dined in their gourmet restaurant,  and had a fabulous meal; also, to‚Ä¶"
December 2009,A Gem In The Heart Of London.,"I picked The Milestone Hotel in London, from a colleagues recommendation -- and also the fact that it was listed as the #1 hotel in London on tripadvisor. From the moment I arrived at the hotel, and was greeted by the friendliest doorman, I knew I had made the right decision. The staff were incredible. The friendliest I have ever encountered. They were always available to talk to, without being intrusive. I was escorted to my room by a member of staff, who very kindly gave me tips and facts about the hotel. The room was spacious, with a very comfortable king bed. A lovely bowl of fruit, and lots of modern touches such as a ipod dock, wireless internet, rain shower, deep bath, exquisite toiletries. No wonder this hotel was rated as Conde Naste #1 hotel in the UK. It's very‚Ä¶"
September 2009,Wonderful stay at the Milestone,"Treated my husband for his birthday for two nights in the run up to Christmas.  We have stayed at several Red Carnation hotels before, our favourite being the Chesterfield.   We really liked The Milestone.  The surroundings and decor are very similar in style to that of the Chesterfield and other hotels within the group.  We find the level of service at all their hotels to be outstanding and the Milestone was no exception. On arrival we were greeted by a gentleman, who gave us a tour of the public rooms before taking us up to our room, which was beautifully appointed, with a lovely view over Kensington Palace Gardens.  He then arranged for a couple of glasses of champagne, to be sent up, very nice!! We dined at the hotel on the first evening, which was lovely as all the rooms‚Ä¶"
December 2009,A special place,"We stayed two nights in this charming, old style hotel close by Kensington Gardens.  Staff and rooms are outstanding.  We only had breakfast at the hotel, it was also great.  Easy access to the Metro to get into London central close to several museums."
December 2009,Can't wait to return,"My-self and hubby had 2 nights at the Milestone and it was lovely. We were celebrating our 25th anniversary.  In our room which was 109 we had champagne and cards off the management.  The staff really can't do enough for you, nothing is to much trouble. We ate in the restaurant the 1st night and I can honestly say it was one of the best meals we had eaten. We opted for breakfast in our room on the 1st morning ( perfect ) Went down for breakfast the 2nd morning ( perfect ).  Our room was very comfortable and roomy.  The hotel is in a fantastic position for getting around London.  Would stay again."
December 2009,Really Lovely Hotel,"Rooms are sweet with a bit of theme. Cosy for sure. Great location. Nicest staff. My only complaint is since it was christmas time they rent out many of the rooms for private functions so if your staying in the hotel you cant always be sure the bar will be free or the tea room etc. Other then that, a lovely lovely stay."
November 2009,Recomended but with minor reservations,"Just returned from an excellent stay at this outstanding hotel. Ideally suited for Kensington, Hyde Park, The Royal Albert Hall and a pleasant walk away from Harrods and Knightsbrige. Covent garden is a ¬£15 taxi ride away, Piccadilly ¬£10.  Staff are excellent and accommodating and the offering, value for money, however, the rooms and public spaces are small (or as we found it a cozy oasis) and the decor (which we liked) is way over the top, but I would suggest it was designed to be that way.  Perhaps the biggest let down was the food. Due to lack of covers you are encouraged to eat at least breakfast in your room, which on the second and third day we tried out of interest (though there had been nothing wrong with the service in the restaurant). It was OK though a lack of chairs‚Ä¶"
November 2009,Making life easy.,"The family trip to London was made 'worry free' by the staff at The Milestone. Arrangements and theatre bookings were made over the 'phone with staff who cared. From the moment we arrived, we were treated as people and not room numbers. Every member of staff wanted us to have an enjoyable stay at their hotel and worked together to make it so. We will be going back to The Milestone in the summer and I am recommending this friendly hotel to all my friends. Thank you Milestone staff and see you soon."
April 2010,Outstanding in every way,"Stayed at the Milestone during November - this was this was the fourth Red Carnation Hotel we have stayed having previously visited 41, Montague on the Gardens and the Chesterfield. The Milestone did not disappoint and maintained the high standards of this hotel group. We were upgarded to the Venetian Suite as it was my wifes birthday,a  complimentary bottle of champagne provided but more importantly the level of personal service and attention was outstanding. From the moment we walked through the hotel entrance the staff could not have been more attentive  to our every need. If you want to enjoy a little luxury then then this is the hotel for you - another memorable visit for all the right reasons"
April 2010,5 star service and comfort,"My Wife has just returned from a 2 night stay at this hotel with our daughter, from check in to check out She was delighted with the service and quality, we have stayed at no41 previous which is just as good, My Wife will return soon with our other daughter to enjoy all that London and this hotel has to offer, many thanks to all the staff at the Milestone for looking after them and making it a special stay."
March 2010,"Great service, problems with breakfast","Fantastic staff on reception and throughout the hotel. All rooms offer a different theme. We had the Jungle Room which had a balcony. Very clean and comfortable, but bed wasn't huge. Stayed in for dinner in the restaurant which was exceptional. Breakfast was not as good though. There were 10 of us and only one member of staff so some of food was cold and the staff member smelled strongly of b.o. Not pleasent but overall enjoyed the stay."
March 2010,Best Hotel Ever,"Shame about the review below about the apartment but you have to say as you find and my wife and I found this hotel to be one of the best we have ever stayed in. On arrival, Terry made us feel like royalty throughout the one night stay we had (Shame he's retiring in July!). Showing us round was a great touch but its' the little things that make it so special - lighting a candle in the bathroom for when we got back, a little history book on chocolate, complimentary drink on arrival, the list is endless. The cooked breakfast was wonderful and served with a smile. We were watching a show at the Royal Albert Hall, so it was perfectly postioned. This part of London is quite upmarket but we will DEFINETELY be coming back here when we come back to London. Thanks really to all the staff‚Ä¶"
February 2010,disappointing,"We were coming to London, read the reviews on Tripadvisor recommending this hotel and decided to splurge.  The apartments photos looked lovely and most of the reviews were very enthusiastic.  And since we were coming for 23 days we wanted to be comfortable, with the convenience of a kitchen.  I had pictured having our friends over, for drinks, a bite to eat.  No way that could happen.  We wouldn't have been able to fit.  And I'm not talking about hordes.  I'm talking about two more people for an hour or so.    We were disappointed, to say the least.    They put up in apartment 6, up in the attic, a little rabbit warren of a place, which was hard enough for me, having to make my way around the living room with my head cricked at a slant, and couldn't sit at the kitchen table‚Ä¶"
March 2010,I feel sorry for those people who never get to stay here!,"This is how I would run a hotel, there was nothing that could have improved our stay. I was a bit worried because I wondered if it would be stuffy and I would feel uncomfortable - this could not have been further from the truth. From the minute we arrived we felt special and genuinely valued and wanted as guests, I think I only said my name upon check in and then every member of staff knew who we were - amazing. The little touches made the whole stay really special and I feel myself welling up thinking about the amount of times I was wowed. I wont go in to much detail as it will spoil it for future guests but I would be shocked if anyone gave less than a rave review. The personal touch is what we have lost these days as we go about our daily business and do we really listen to‚Ä¶"
September 2009,as good as it gets,"My family and I had the pleasure of a four night stay at the Milestone in March of 2010.  We book through American Express when possible.  The agent steered us to a hotel down the street, and upon arrival, we figured it made sense to check out the Milestone, which was my wife's first choice.    From the moment we set foot in the hotel, the staff treated us with courtesy and respect.  We were given a tour of the property and quickly decided to retrieve our belongings from the other property and check in for the duration of our stay.  We chose a suite with two levels.  The room was beautifully decorated, exceedingly clean, and comfortable.   The upstairs room had a sofa bed, television, small pool table, and half bath. Perfect in all respects.  The bathroom was roomy and elegant. ‚Ä¶"
March 2010,Simply class.,"Stayed last year at this hotel although not sure exactly when! Been meaning to write a review for sometime.  Ok you know as soon as you walk into the hotel its a different level as your greeted by name. Very friendly gentleman showed us around the hotel which is always nice particularly as the Milestone seems to have some history. Once we were shown to our room it was made clear that if we needed anything no matter what then please ask, even if it meant a room service item or meal that wasnt on the menu. Room was very comfortable if slightly small although i think we may of just got a little unlucky with that. I liked the location of the Hotel. Turn right and have a nice stroll down the road and you will be in the middle of the main shopping areas harrods etc. Concierge were‚Ä¶"
April 2008,The Milestone is PERFECT!,"I have stayed at five star hotels all over the world and The Milestone is really at the top of my list!  I did extensive research prior to my stay and landed on the Milestone.   I was more than pleased and could not have been any happier with every aspect of this hotel.  Upon check-in, I was given a tour of the hotel and all the amenities by the hotel butler.  In addition, we were offered a complimentary drink at the hotel bar while the room was being prepared (we arrived early).   In about 15 mins, the room was ready and the butler showed us to the room.  I purchased a king room and it was very nice.   That being said, the butler indicated that the hotel was not full and that upgrades were available if we were interested.   They showed us to a suite and offered it to us for‚Ä¶"
February 2010,In Love With The Milestone,"My husband and I were in London for a spring wedding, and for this particular visit, we chose to stay at the Milestone. It has had tons of buzz in the travel industry and every client I sent there myself came back with rave reviews. Having stayed at many of London's top hotels, I had high expectations and the Milestone blew me away. Our room was upgraded at no extra cost, and it was an upgrade like none I have ever had before. Our suite was hidden behind a fake bookcase and our room was bi-level with a spiral staircase and a sprawling balcony overlooking Kensington Park. The decor was tasteful and welcoming with warm colors and a spread of books for us to enjoy. On the top level, the walls had been painted to look like an antique library full of books and there was a snooker‚Ä¶"
August 2009,Marvelous Boutique Hotel,"I spent four nights here with my young daughter.  This hotel is splendid.  I can see why it has such high TripAdvisor ratings.  First of all, the decor is WONDERFUL.  This is a Victorian building that has been lovingly renovated in the full-on English ""we love patterns"" sort of way.  If you need Japanese zen decor to relax, don't stay here.  But if you want to feel like you are in England, and you enjoy elegant & cozy decor with lots of throw pillows and warm fires and cozy nooks and fresh flowers, you will love it here.  We stayed in the Viscount Suite (a junior suite), which was gorgeous and overlooked Hyde Park.  What is really special about this hotel is all the thoughtful details they put in your room.  The room desk, for example, is stocked like your desk at home--it even‚Ä¶"
August 2009,"Great hotel, but niggly problems","First of all this is a stunning hotel in a great location for Kensington, Knightsbridge and Notting Hill for retail therapy and relaxing. Very attentive staff who are really friendly. The rooms are a little small - or should I say, there was a lot of furniture crammed in to our room.  However, lack of a functioning TV (it had to be repaired twice in a four day stay), an unstable wireless set-up was a small price to pay for an unbelievable trip to London."
July 2009,wonderful small hotel in perfect location,"Our first time in London...this hotel was recommended by travel agent. Lovely hotel! We stayed a week in an apartment...my recommendation if you have a family. We loved having the extra room and my kids(18 & 11) had their own rooms. 2 bathrooms also which is a HUGE plus! Perfect location without car. Bus stop was right across the street and tube station is a short walk down the street. Staff is top notch!! Ask and you shall receive...and I'm not kidding about that!! If you are an avid runner or walker, you will love Kensington Park right across the street. We had a fantastic time in London!"
August 2009,Wonderful service perfect stay with our four legged friend!,"Cant fault the service we recieved at this hotel,great location,attention to detail,best hotel we have stayed at with or without our Maggie dog.Perfect in every way."
July 2009,Absolutely Fantastic - It's all in the attention to detail.,"My wife and I arranged a one night stay at the Milestone Hotel for our Anniversary.  We arrived late afternoon to what was an emaculate Hotel with the highest level of service I have ever encountered.  The friendly staff were only a phone call away - nothing was too much trouble and we were made to feel like absolute royalty.  We ate in their restaurant that evening before going out to the theatre.  It was quiet, relaxing and the waiter service was extremely professional, polite and very friendly.  The breakfast was beautifully presented and equally tasty - loved the sausages!  The room itself was emmaculate, very spacious and the maid service's attention to every detail reaffirmed the feeling of royalty.  I have never stayed anywhere like the Milestone before I doubt highly‚Ä¶"
May 2006,"Dynamite experience, highly recommend!",We stayed at the Milestone Hotel during a resent trip to Europe. It was an unparallel hotel experience! The Milestone is in a prime location overlooking the park. They thought of everything down to fresh fruit delived to our room daily. We had afternoon tea on our private balcany. If you want to live like a prince this is the place to do it!
June 2009,The best in the world,"I could write a book about how much I enjoyed my stay at The Milestone.  But instead, I'll just say this:  I travel a lot for work, all over the world, and The Milestone is simply the best I have experienced in the world.  The service, the rooms, the location -- unbeatable.  Well worth it!"
June 2006,The finest service I have ever experienced,"We stayed at the MIlestone for 6 days following a Mediterranean cruise. From the moment our car dropped us at the hotel, until the morning we left, we could not find fault with anything about this great hotel. Pedro and Abdi. whose vocation in life seems to be to ensure that guests at their hotel are relieved of stress completely, were attentive in the most professional way imaginable, friendly but not too much, informative but to just the right degree. These guys have been doing this a long time! The front desk was responsive. courteous, and on the ball. They knew exactly the  status of our room, and offered us an upgrade to a suite that was as elegant as could be( admittedly, they asked us if we would be willing to pay a little extrs for this -- it was worth every penny). I‚Ä¶"
August 2009,one of the top five hotels in london,"i'll cut it short...great ambience hotel,the perfect example of an old style english accomodation in a fantastic city like london!"
July 2009,Way overrated and an obsequious and annoying attempt at good service,"We spent two nights at the Milestone, at the end of a European trip.  We were drawn to the hotel by its location and the sterling reviews we read on Trip Advisor, to say nothing of the Conde Naste Traveller awards, etc that the hotel has received.  The location is indeed perfect, across the road from Hyde Park and Kensington Palace.  The building itself is charming, a beautiful old brick house converted to a hotel.  The hotel prides itself (and promotes itself) as service oriented, but therein lies the rub.  It is one thing to have good service, it is quite another to have service that is obsequious and annoying, to the point of being nearly childish.  Somehow, the hotel management got it into their heads that presenting a cartoon version of Merry Old England, would appeal to‚Ä¶"
November 2005,Wonderful location for kids,"We spent a few nights at The Milestone and loved every minute of it.  The location is great -- right across the street from Kensington Gardens, which is so nice if you have kids who need some air.   It's close to the Princess Diana playground, Whole Foods, Le Pain Quotidien, and the Tube.  The staff were so kind and extremely helpful.  We immediately felt welcome.  Will definitely come back."
February 2006,Excellent,We stayed at the Milestone last year and have already rebooked our next visit for May this year. We had an excellent stay the service was second to none and the rooms were lovely. Recomend this hotel to anyone who wants fantastic accomodation. 
September 2005,Great birthday,My husband arranged for me to spend my 50th birthday at the Milestone.It was fantastic.The staff couldn't do enough for us and made my stay there very special.Ideally situated for a good shopping spree and our room overlooked Kensington Palace. On my birthday the staff arranged a beautiful fresh cream birthday cake (and they let me take most of it home) and a bottle of champagne. I cannot state how great my stay was and it's true you get what you pay for.Worth every penny 
August 2005,worth a stay,"Went to the Milestone for our tenth anniversary this October. It is actually a beautiful and charming inn. We had a lovely room with a good view of the Kensington Palace grounds. It has a real Dickens/old english feel which we were after.  The hotel is kept in excellent condition. Everything worked. The street noise was not bothersome. The room was quiet and sumptous. Staff were also generally friendly.   The concierge went out of his way to book restaurants and a show for our stay. In fact the concierge service is the best I have ever encountered and we do travel widely.  On the minus side the hotel is small, in just about every way. The restaurant while fine at breakfast would be a little cramped at dinner. I do not recommend the bar for the same reason. In addition it is a‚Ä¶"
July 2008,Made a Very Special Day Sublime,"September 3 2005 and the most fabulous day of my life - my wedding day.  We had to change our plans at short notice and decided to get married in London with just a few guests.  The Milestone had been recommended and I was delighted to find out that it was available.  We visited the hotel quietly to check out the decor, food and the service and found all 3 to be faultless.    We arranged a meeting with the functions manager, Stefan, who could not possibly have been more helpful and we were able to hand almost everything over to him to arrange.  Babysitters for the guests' children, hairdressers, early check in, 3 choices of food for each course, flowers,decor etc etc; it was all handled by Stefan with the greatest aplomb.  Nothing fazed him and his suggestions proved invaluable‚Ä¶"
July 2008,Unsurpassed service/excellent location,"We had lived in London for six years, in Kensington and were returning to visit friends before we moved to Shanghai as well as celebrating our 30th Anniversary.  A lot of people elect to stay in the expensive hotels on Park Lane in Mayfair but the Milestone is a gem of a hotel, a listed building, both inside and outside, with staff that go out of their way to take care of your every need.  Further, it has character and a limited number of rooms unlike some of those 100+ room hotels.  Breakfast is a bit expensive and if you know your way around, can be found at less than half the price for a short walk.  That being said, you can have formal afternoon tea, single malt's in the bar and the dinner at Cheneston's is quite good.  The latter, for London, is not outrageously expensive. ‚Ä¶"
June 2008,beautiful place to stay...,"We loved staying at the Milestone Hotel.. very English and the staff is very helpful.  Our room was small but very elegant and extremely clean.  We had a beautiful view of Hyde Park... which is also the side where the street is, but surprisedly it was quiet. Actually, I specifically noticed things in the hotel, and everything is well taken care of and clean.   My daughter and I had breakfast in our room every morning, the food was good but somewhat expensive.  Pretty much the food in London was expensive.  We ate dinner in the restaurant one evening, it was good and the service was good too.  I would definitely recommend this hotel, good location... great staff and beautiful rooms... we will stay here again."
June 2008,Fantastic but,We have stayed at 5 star hotels all over the world and for service this was one of the best. The staff could not do enough for you. Gavin concierge was excellent.Complimentary tea when we arrived at 11.30 pm and impeccable service throughout our stay. Our only gripe was that our room (311) was facing the road and there was some traffic noise (some sort of intererior glazing would fix) also there was a creaking floorboard in the room above that the guest kept walking over until 1 am that was annoying. All in all if you want a class hotel that lives up to its status then this is it.
May 2008,A gem,"Just an ideal London boutique hotel.  The right size--so that all amenities are available, the right staff--warm and welcoming, and the right location--overlooking Kensington Park.    Our duplex room decorated like a library featured a billards table/dining table (you'd need to see it) and upstairs living area that served as our children's sleeping area.  Bathroom was well appointed (though I find those European shower enclosures frustrating).  Everynight candy and canapes were delivered and the turn-down service was excellent.  Comfy beds. The roll-away beds need some looking after as a couple of them were missing slats. Breakfasts were classic british or continental as you choose.  A sweet little bar/conservatory area make a nice nook for a drink or tea.    My only significant‚Ä¶"
April 2008,The best hotel we have ever stayed at,"Originally I booked this as it was the closest to the Royal Albert Hall as we were going to a concert there.  What a find, nothing was too much trouble and all the staff were very helpful.  Terry showed us around the hotel and our room.  The afternoon tea we had was huge and lovely, the cakes and scones we could not finish they sent up to our room for later.  The room itself was excellent decorated in a victorian theme.  After the concert we came back and sat in the lounge and was entertained by a person singing and playing the piano who was excellent.  Overall a wonderful place that makes you feel special.  Much better than the Ritz which we stayed at the week before and not as pricy."
December 2004,The Most Pleasant Expreience!,"My husband and I just returned from a long weekend at The Milestone May 15-19th.  The hotel is completely charming. The staff is very friendly and accomodating, especially Neil at the concierge, who helped us with restaurant reservations and even offered to personally check out the table at our restaurant before we got there to make sure it was appropriate for us!    Speaking of restaurants, you must try Ffiona's just a few blocks away - what a delicious meal!!  We stayed in a superior double room with a clear view of Kensington Palace  The room was very cozy, nicely decorated and comfortable.  The bathroom was spacious and spotless.    The hotel really feels like a home away from home.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone!  I can see why it remains at the top reviewed by‚Ä¶"
June 2005,We Love the Milestone!,"My wife and I stayed in the Milestone Hotel for 4 days while visiting London for our daughter's grad school graduation.  We booked a Superior King room and were delighted upon receiving an upgrade upon arrival.  I travel frequently for both business and personal reasons, and I am very demanding when it comes to service and accomodations. The Milestone exceeded my requirements and expectations in all categories. All members of the staff greeted us by name without exception, including upon our exit from the cab upon arrival, and they were quick to offer assistance and suggestions to meet our every need.  They were the most attentive and friendly hotel professionals that we have encountered in our extensive world travels over a period of many years.  Their personal touch was most‚Ä¶"
July 2005,"Terrific service, excellent location","We stayed at The Milestone from Dec. 23, 2004, through Jan 2, 2005.  I found the service impeccable.  The food was British- we Americans must over-season everything-  but High Tea was fabulous and the bartender from Italy makes GREAT drinks!  We celebrated Christmas in one of their aparments, and they even put a small tree up for us!  Christmas brunch was excellent.  All of the concierge's recommendations were wonderful.  I have recently entered a sweepstakes where the giveaway is a 4 night stay at The Milestone, and I can honestly say the only reason I bothered to enter was to get to go back and visit this lovely hotel! "
January 2005,One of my favorites in London,We stayed at the Milestone for two days prior to taking a cruise from Southampton. From the moment we arrived the personal attention was outstanding. The room as one would expect from an older hotel were on the small size when compared to what Americans are used to. But the room was wonderfully appointed and the bathroom was actually quite large. There are lots of nice little touches as well.  The lobby and public areas were charming. The breakfast was very over priced and quite ordinary. The lounge was a terrfic spot to relax after a busy day. The location is close to the Tube (Circle and District Lines) and the neighborhood is very nice and upscale. The Palace gardens are a great place for an early morning run.  All and all I highly recommend the Milestone for any one who‚Ä¶
April 2008,"Perhaps suitable for Mr. Average, but disappointing for selective guests","I travel to London on business almost every month and the Milestone is ""my"" hotel.  There are three main reasons why I stay at the Milestone:  great staff and personalized service; unique, comfortable rooms; and proximity to Kensington Park (just across the street).  They've got a cozy bar with a friendly bartender and the food is good as well (although expensive).  Compared to the large, impersonal hotel across the street with small, kennel-like rooms that are mostly alike, the Milestone is a real gem.  Is it perfect?  No.  The Milestone doesn't tolerate wild swings in temperature very well.  The heating and A/C system doesn't handle high highs and low lows (I've had to request a space heater and a fan during stays there) but I'm willing to put up with that for all of the other‚Ä¶"
March 2008,Wow!  What a Fantastic Hotel to Stay in,"As a connoisseur of 5 star hotels worldwide, and a marketing specialist, I know quality. In my opinion, attention to detail is what makes a hotel memorable or forgettable.. There were several disappointments at this hotel, however the staff are absolutely superb, and were very accommodating.  Whilst the suite itself was sumptuously decorated, (Prince Albert Suite) and very suitable, there were problems one after another.  I had called ahead an hour before to let the concierge know my flight had changed and I would be arriving earlier, to please re-arrange the chauffeur and suite. When I arrived, tired and cold from a very shoddy flight, I was asked to wait, as the room was not ready. I was gracious, not wanting to be a bother, however I was still waiting an hour and a half‚Ä¶"
February 2008,Best Hotel Experience in Many Years,"I had been hoping to stay at the Red Carnation's 5* Milestone hotel since discovering the Red Carnation chain some 18 months ago.  I have to say that it was well worth the wait.  From the Door Men to the waitress serving breakfast, the service is sublime, couldn't be faulted and nothing was too much trouble.  The room - wow what a view we had of Kensington Palace Gardens, the view was worth the supplement.  Even overlooking a busy road, there was hardly any noise from the outside traffic.  The room was decorated in keeping with other RCH hotels, rich use of curtains and fabrics, antiques and lovely pictures, all gave the room a sense of style.  The Air con was working fine, although a little bit noisy, but we didn't need to keep it on overnight.  I found the bathroom a little‚Ä¶"
February 2008,A haven where the staff care,"A supprise weekend right up to the moment the car pulled up outside the front door. The doorman was there welcoming us (not like the Baglioni) and taking the luggage before you could say Jack Flash. Once inside my partner checked in whilst i chatted with one of the very knowledgable butlers. Once he assertained where we had travelled from he knew who we were without the list. A quick and friendly check in and we were then given the grand tour whilst on route to the Jungle Room. We met and were introduced to most of the F@B staff who would look after us over the next two days.  Well what can i say it was like being a long lost friend, all the  staff knew who we were (just a couple up in town from cornwall) and their willingness to look after everyone with passion and flair was‚Ä¶"
September 2006,Mind the Gap!,"It was our frist trip to England and I was there with my wife to celebrate my birthday, But London is cold at this time of the year...who cares, never been there and had to make it special. London is magical, feeling like Peter Pan although I'm older, I felt like a kid entering Disneyland for he first time, never felt tired until the end of the day, after a day of walking, sightseeing, watching shows at west end, shopping, and dining...but to end my day on my goose down king size bed and pillows just made resting a much different level. The Milestone did not idsaapoint at all even thought they were doing construction during the day, the noise above me at one time was just not tolerable..but any old hotel with so muh character will show its age...and will need upkeep. The room‚Ä¶"
August 2006,Unforgettable,"My girlfriend and I were lucky enough to stay at the luxurious Milestone Hotel, Kensington. We were collected from Liverpool street station in a Bentley by Terry our butler and Keith our chaffer and given a guided tour of London on the way to the Milestone. The stay at the hotel was outstanding and we found EVERY member of staff dedicated to enhancing the experience of staying in such luxurious hotel. The first thing we did after checking in was shop, escorted by Jim the head concierge which gave us the feeling we were in safe hands.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone as I‚Äôve never been somewhere so customer orientated but hope to get the chance again soon. The bar and mixologist, Daniel, and his cocktails were an experience in themselves and not to be missed.  The food was‚Ä¶"
August 2006,"Problems solved, great stay!","We stayed at the Milestone hotel in London with our two sons, aged 5 and 8, after a previous fantastic stay we had as a couple about a month ago. We booked two connecting rooms, but were faced with some serious problems upon arrival. The rooms were on the fifth floor, that was recently refurbished, but evidently this process was not quite finished. There were no locks on the outer door, the rooms were really extremely small, the DVD-player was not working. TV-channels were mixed up, the airco was out of order, etc. All staff members were extremely helpfull and kind, but the problems remained. That evening we told the Milestone this was not worth their five star rating and their splending reputation and invited them to come up with a solution the next morning. The solution they‚Ä¶"
July 2006,Like Staying in a Wonderful Private Home,"If you are looking for a wonderful small hotel with a very British feel then the Milestone is for you!  We had a wonderful stay there.  The staff is so friendly and helpful.  After a full day of site seeing it felt like coming home.....if only my home was decorated so lovely!  The rooms are cheerful and comfortable though a little on the small size compared to American standards.  The location is great, right across the street from Kensington Palace, quiet yet not too far from the action.  The tube station is a short walk and the on and off bus lets you off almost at the hotel door.  There are several good places to eat close by.  We had an excellent meal at the Indian restaurant down the block and the Italian restaurant makes the best pizza...even better than the ones we had in‚Ä¶"
July 2006,The Milestone - A well-kept secret,"We wanted to be near a friend's flat in Kensington and she recommended the Milestone Hotel as an excellent choice of hotel.  We're glad we took her advice - it is a real gem!  The decor is unfussy English and the staff couldn't be any nicer.  Our room was a little small but immaculate and we loved the rain shower head in the bath.  We had an excellent dinner our first night and the breakfast buffet was more than adequate with choices of hot dishes available.  We would definitely stay there again.  Travelers from Amelia Island, FL "
June 2006,Wonderful hotel!,"We had a wonderful stay at the Milestone Hotel from Aug 23 - 26, 2006. The management staff would greet us by name and stop and chat with us  during breakfast or while we were relaxing in the lounge with afternoon drinks. The concierge helped us with tourist venue reservations and also with wonderful dinner reservations at neighborhood restaurants and also at the hotel restaurant. He also helped by email prior to our travels. The head butler is a charming man who is extremely proud of the hotel and is a very good hospitality ambassador! He took us on a tour of the hotel which we enjoyed.  Our room was very quiet and off the main street and tastefully decorated in a French toile motif. We had 2 large chairs to read the daily paper that was delivered to us and to relax in also,‚Ä¶"
June 2006,Milestone exceeds our expectations in every way!,"We had a fantastic stay at the Milestone, and would recommend the hotel to anyone. It is a very charming small hotel, well located within a few minute walk to the High Street - Kensington tube station, where you have access to all of London on their wonderfully convenient Subway system. There is also plenty of shopping, and pubs for dining and nightlife within easy walking distance. Rooms are on the smaller side (which can be expected for London), so I recommend reserving one category higher than you would usually be comfortable in. However they are appointed with every possible modern luxury and convenience, you will not be disappointed. They are richly decorated, with wall hangings, comfortable furniture and beds. But the best part of staying at the Milestone is the service.‚Ä¶"
June 2006,So comfortable!,"15th July, 2006  This is the third visit to this hotel in Kensington which we have found to have excellent service, lovely staff and beautiful rooms. Right in front of Kensington Gardens, you have plenty of shops, pubs and restaurants in walking distance but are only 10 mins away from the West End. Every room I have seen (total of 5) are all differently but individually decorated and include all the essentials even down to stationery items in the desk. We have stayed in many hotels in London (including Claridges and Blakes) but this is our favourite. "
June 2006,Charming Hotel with Great Service,"Our family enjoyed this hotel and its wonderful ambience.  Although one of our original rooms was too small and inconsistent with the description,  the front desk worked with us to move us to a larger room for a supplemental charge. Terry, the butler, was especially charming.  Full English breakfasts were very good, and dinner was excellent.  The concierge was extremely accomodating.  We appreciated the free internet access.  Sometimes the doorman has to work hard to hail a taxi so allow plenty of time before the theatre or dinner out. "
May 2005,Wonderful place to stay!,"My husband and I stayed at the Milestone in June while we were en route to Dover for a cruise to the Baltic.  We had stayed at the Milestone a few times before and always loved it.  We booked a de luxe room with king bed.  The night before we left home for London I had a message on my machine to ring the front desk at the Milestone.  I was worried that something had gone wrong with our reservation!  I talked to the Duty Manager who told me that our room's AC was not working (and London is hot this summer!) so he asked if we would mind down grading to a room with efficient AC.  He added that this would be for one night only, and then, as compensation we would be moved to a suite.  Well, what could I say!  In fact the room we were put in for the first night was lovely, if a little‚Ä¶"
January 2008,Love this hotel and can't wait to return!,This is one of the best small hotels we have ever stayed at anywhere.  We stayed with our teenagers in one of the 2 bedroom apartments.  It had a kitchen and a washer and dryer.  It was beautiful!  The staff is outstanding and the concierges could not have been more helpful.  This hotel was a joy to come back to every afternoon after long hot days of sightseeing.  We have so much more to explore in London and we will look forward to staying here again. 
February 2008,We LOVED the Milestone!!!,"I recently stayed at the Milestone Hotel in London, having won an auction for the stay on luxury link.   The trip was a weekend ""girl's weekend"" on the eve of my brother-in-law's wedding; the three hotel guests were me, my mother-in-law and the bride-to-be.  I wanted this to be a special weekend, so I looked for a nice package on luxurylink.(--) that included extra treats like high tea and a full breakfast, as both of which can be very pricey in london.  The package was for 2 people, but I called ahead and was told it would be okay to have a third person, but there would be a 30 pound fee for an extra bed, and I would have to pay for the third breakfast and tea separately.   Upon arrival, however,  they indicated that they had, instead of adding an additional bed, decided to‚Ä¶"
January 2008,Loved the Milestone,"We stayed for five nights to celebrate silver anniversary and birthday. We had booked through the Leading Hotels of the World website way in advance and got a decent rate that included the continental breakfast. The reception and concierge were very helpful and friendly. When they showed us the bus stop they actually went outside the hotel to point me in the right direction. They hung up the phone when I approached to ask a question. The room was very lovely, with a canopy bed, small table with 2 chairs and a desk. It had a good size closet. The bedroom was a few steps up from the entrance and the bathroom was level with the entrance. The bath was old fashioned and lovely. Every night they lit a candle in a water-filled bowl by the bath tub, and there was a different treat every‚Ä¶"
November 2007,A fab boutique hotel worth visiting!,"My husband and I recently returned from a two-week jaunt through Europe including London on the front and back ends. The trip included Spain, Switzerland and Sweden and I can tell you, hands down, that the Milestone was the highlight of the trip (and I'm hard to impress).   The butler (Terry) is a scream, but in a proper, British sort of way. Since we were only there for one night at the beginning of our trip, we booked the least expensive room rate. Terry showed us our room, but then showed us a few other rooms that were available for an upgrade. While we loved this little tour, we decided not to upgrade as it was already late and we were getting up early to catch our flight. Our room was small and not as smartly decorated as the others we previewed, but the bathroom was large‚Ä¶"
December 2007,"Lovely Hotel, Lovelier Staff","I celebrated a milestone birthday at the Milestone Hotel and couldn't have been happier with my experience.  From the moment my friend and I checked in till the moment we left, the staff was attentive, courteous and kind. We were upgraded to a large and luxurious room, offered a bottle of champagne (which was brought to the room with extra glasses so we could share it with friends) and advised that a birthday cake had been arranged for me. Following check-in, we were shown around the public rooms and then graciously escorted to our sumptious quarters.  After I booked the stay, I was sent a Guest Preference form to complete. Clearly, someone paid attention, because our quiet, non-smoking room was decorated in a favorite color scheme, had plenty of pillows, lots of hangers and a‚Ä¶"
October 2007,Top notch service with luxourious rooms & fantastic architecture,"The Milestone is one of my favorite hotels in the world.  The staff go out of their way to ensure the guest's comfort (from the friendly butler, to the helpful concierge, to the great maid service which brings you fruit, candies and little appetizers every night).  There are so many little touches that make this property spectacular.  It's in a beautiful building, the rooms are spacious, quiet, & the interior decorating is superb.  We loved the Venetian suite.  Make sure you have their tea & scones, it's the best tea experience in London.  This is not a cookie-cutter generic type hotel - it has a lot of character & old-world elegance.  They are very centrally located, with a great view of Kensington Park.  The resistance pool is also very nice if you like swimming."
August 2007,One of the best hotels in London,"Very nice small hotel; the suite was not so big, but well appointed and comfortable. Just a bit of noise coming from the street."
August 2007,Hotel for the discerning,"I ended up here after the ParkCity could not extend my stay so I was not very happy at having to pay 230 gbp for a nights sleep.  Thats where the downer stops... Brilliant location, my room overlooked Kensington Palace.  Brilliant check in, I arrived early and the Receptionist noticed I had a Blackberry and offered to email me once the room was ready. Brilliant room, stayed in the Safari Suite and was impressed.  Brilliant bar, the waiter knew his stuff and we settled on a nice Bordeaux ! I really have a problem finding problems with this hotel and I am in the trade so usually I am faulting them. Maybe 2 gripes - insufficient foreign language tv channels for the overseas visitors and for a hotel of this standard , no green tea in the room. I consider this hotel to be a gem."
July 2007,Milestone is Great,"Everything was perfect at the Milestone - service, decor, friendliness of staff, quality of furnishings and fixtures.  And the food - the ""Midnight Lovers' Feast"" was marvelous.  Will certainly stay there again."
May 2007,Setting the standard.,"I have recently returned from my second stay at The Milestone Hotel within the last month. I was initially recommended the hotel by American Express (Centurion Card-Black Card), their restaurant and hotel recommendations are generally very good. The Milestone was recently voted the fourth best hotel in the world by a leading travel magazine and I can unreservadly endorse this accolade.  London has a comprehensive choice of hotels ranging from budget to some of the worlds best........this is one of the worlds best for customer service. The hotel is relatively small with less than sixty bedrooms, it was built in the 19th century as two  townhouses and retains many of its original period features. All of the rooms are totally different but have all been decorated with style and‚Ä¶"
December 2023,"Small, nice, but costly","My wife and I stayed for five nights and found the hotel small and quaint, however in my opinion very much overpriced for what we received.  Good points:  Service was great and the staff does try to take care of you as best as possible.  Clean, nice, and good location.  Not so good points: Dinner and amenities are overpriced...probably due to the size of the hotel.  We had dinner the first night and my steak came out very rare...they did not prepare a new steak but simply reheated the raw steak.  Not what I expect when paying for an expensive meal...$1,000 U.S. for two.    I asked them to fix the air conditioner because it made a very loud screeching noise that would wake us up at night.  This was not fixed so we got used to waking up 2 - 3 times a night.  Overall, we have‚Ä¶"

December 2023,Fantastic Staff make this Hotel,"I have been very slack with my reviews of our last holiday. We stayed in this hotel in May for 4 nights. The Milestone is in a fantastic location with Hyde Park opposite. Great for kids to run around and burn off energy. There are heaps of reasonably priced restaurants around and shops to buy beer, wine and snacks. The underground is a short walk and you are central to get to all areas of London easily. I was a bit disappointed in the room we had. The carpet was stained and the paint was chipped. It just had that run down feel. They also don‚Äôt have proper king size beds, only two singles pushed (or zipped?) together. We were limited in the room we had as we had to have an extra bed for our 12 year old son. Many of the rooms are quite small ‚Äì but that is London. I was also‚Ä¶"
November 2023,"Milestone redefined top-notch hospitality ‚Äì A remarkable stay beyond expectations!""","We travelled from Dubai for a December holiday in the UK, with a short stay in London at the end.  Milestone is by far the best hotel we have stayed at, and that comes from a person who has clocked in 1000+ nights in various hotels over the last 10 years.  What stood out for us: 1. Personal touch: From the doorman to the concierge to the bar staff, every single member of staff made an effort to remember our names and called us by name every time   2. Attention to the smallest of details: spectacular housekeeping and turn down service; for example they wrapped our electronics cables with cable ties to make the room tidy, or they lit a candle in the bath tub every night. They did not forget to restock a single item, it was sheer perfection   3. Food: Exquisite food, especially the breakfast. We are on a healthy diet and their selection catered to those who prefer to indulge and those who want to be healthy  4. Catering to requests: we wanted off menu items which they happily provided us to the room  5. Comfort: the mattress and bed linen was high quality, pillows were the kind you can sink into and the bathroom has very high quality soft towels  We will certainly return and would recommend this hotel to anyone who values the small extra touches and high quality service that is certainly a cut above the rest.‚Ä¶"
December 2023,The Milestone is Awesome!,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the lovely Milestone Hotel, July 23rd-26th, 2023. It more than exceeded our expectations! Prior to arriving in London, my husband had been in Liverpool with friends for The Open and I had been in The Lake District with friends. We planned to meet in London for a few days before returning home. My train on July 23rd was cancelled due to flooding on the tracks which led to a very long day of transfers by taxi from one train station to the next. I finally made it to Euston Station on the evening of July 23rd. When I arrived by taxi to The Milestone, I was greeted by the lovely receptionist who told me we had been upgraded to The Hermes Suite - this was music to my ears, especially after the trying day of travel. My husband was waiting for me in our gorgeous suite, along with a lovely bottle of champagne, fruit, and cheese. We immediately ordered room service, which was delicious. After dinner in our room, I indulged with a good long bath in the stunning marble soaking tub!! What started out being a rather stressful day ended with luxury and relaxation - just what I needed! Our remaining days in London and at The Milestone were wonderful. Breakfast each morning was delicious, and the staff were fabulous! Our trip ended with a very early morning transfer to Heathrow provided by the hotel - we were given morning coffee and a box of delicious fresh baked pastries to take in the car! ‚Ä¶"

The food is second to none and the festive afternoon tea is the best we‚Äôve had (and we have sampled more than a few). The staff are warm and friendly and everyday there were small touches that made our stay truly personalised, unique and special. We come back every year and will continue to do so, as for us the hotel is a home away from home. Not to mention the central location which makes it easy to travel all over London. The milestone offers luxury in a warm cosy bundle, which is rare to find."

November 2023,"Milestone redefined top-notch hospitality ‚Äì A remarkable stay beyond expectations!""","We travelled from Dubai for a December holiday in the UK, with a short stay in London at the end.  Milestone is by far the best hotel we have stayed at, and that comes from a person who has clocked in 1000+ nights in various hotels over the last 10 years.  What stood out for us: 1. Personal touch: From the doorman to the concierge to the bar staff, every single member of staff made an effort to remember our names and called us by name every time   2. Attention to the smallest of details: spectacular housekeeping and turn down service; for example they wrapped our electronics cables with cable ties to make the room tidy, or they lit a candle in the bath tub every night. They did not forget to restock a single item, it was sheer perfection   3. Food: Exquisite food, especially the breakfast. We are on a healthy diet and their selection catered to those who prefer to indulge and those who want to be healthy  4. Catering to requests: we wanted off menu items which they happily provided us to the room  5. Comfort: the mattress and bed linen was high quality, pillows were the kind you can sink into and the bathroom has very high quality soft towels  We will certainly return and would recommend this hotel to anyone who values the small extra touches and high quality service that is certainly a cut above the rest.‚Ä¶"
December 2023,The Milestone is Awesome!,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the lovely Milestone Hotel, July 23rd-26th, 2023. It more than exceeded our expectations! Prior to arriving in London, my husband had been in Liverpool with friends for The Open and I had been in The Lake District with friends. We planned to meet in London for a few days before returning home. My train on July 23rd was cancelled due to flooding on the tracks which led to a very long day of transfers by taxi from one train station to the next. I finally made it to Euston Station on the evening of July 23rd. When I arrived by taxi to The Milestone, I was greeted by the lovely receptionist who told me we had been upgraded to The Hermes Suite - this was music to my ears, especially after the trying day of travel. My husband was waiting for me in our gorgeous suite, along with a lovely bottle of champagne, fruit, and cheese. We immediately ordered room service, which was delicious. After dinner in our room, I indulged with a good long bath in the stunning marble soaking tub!! What started out being a rather stressful day ended with luxury and relaxation - just what I needed! Our remaining days in London and at The Milestone were wonderful. Breakfast each morning was delicious, and the staff were fabulous! Our trip ended with a very early morning transfer to Heathrow provided by the hotel - we were given morning coffee and a box of delicious fresh baked pastries to take in the car! ‚Ä¶"

December 2023,Simply amazing,"  Our visit to Shangri La turned out to be the most amazing end of a friends afternoon gathering in London!   The bar has the most amazing views, gorgeous setting and the coziest Christmas decorations, from the lobby to the bar.   Excellently curated choice of cocktails, crafted and put together with utmost care by Simone. We were lucky enough to have him sharing his knowledge and reccomending the best choices for us. He made the most outstanding cocktails,  we also had  a couple of superb Negroni.   Our waiter Asore was lovely.  His presence and excellent service made the perfect visit.   All staff were brilliant: Michael, Jojo, Tati and Simona. A pure delight.  All you want for a classy, fun and elegant evening."

December 2023,Incredible!,"Shangri-La Hotel at The Shard in London is a pinnacle of luxury, and my stay in the suite was nothing short of extraordinary. Three rooms of opulence paired with an unparalleled view that defies belief. The breakfast experience was a gastronomic delight, offering an incredible array of flavors.

December 2023,Underwhelming unfortunately,"Very underwhelming experience, as soon as you are greeted at the front door your bags, luggage, coat etc have to go through an airport security scanner which we found a little strange as we have stayed in some of the most prestigious hotels in the world & never had to do this, this has to be repeated every time you leave the hotel also and became a little boring & repetitive during our stay. The lift to the rooms is 35 floors up where you are met by the check in, our room was not ready so we waited and enjoyed 2 diet cokes at nearly ¬£20 for the two, there was a ¬£200 charge added to my bank card which is fine however it then takes 5-7 working days for this to be refunded which seems a little long. The room was nice, lovely bathroom & comfortable bed however the television had‚Ä¶"

December 2023,"Absolute legendary guest relations manager, Tyrone!","Two very dear friends of mine were staying here over the weekend and I called up to order a gift to be left in their room for when they arrive. Even after a slight hiccup, Tyrone went above and beyond for me and my visiting friends; making their stay extra special and made them feel very welcome. Tyrone was at the end of a phone/email to me to ensure everything requested had been done and that he was available should we need any more assistance‚Ä¶I wasn‚Äôt even the guest and felt very looked after and I know my friends were blown away by the gestures, kindness and attentiveness by Tyrone and the hotel.

December 2023,Wonderful!,"In all my years this was one of my favourite hotel experiences.   From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special - Wong on the front desk was cheerful and welcoming and even managed to check us in a little early.  It was a special occasion and my husband had upgraded our room.  It had a WOW factor from the second we opened the door.   The view was incredible and the fact I could lie in bed and look at St. Pauls Cathedral was a real added bonus.  Our dinner and breakfast were of the highest quality.  Breakfast is a mixture of service and self service.  There is much choice but do not hesitate to ask if there is anything you would like brought to your table.  Rarely do I leave a hotel without any negative comments, however small.  My only disappointment was that we were‚Ä¶"

November 2023,An afternoon tea in the clouds!,"We had a great time at the Festive Afternoon Tea at Tƒ™NG Shangri-la this November.   Dining in the clouds on the 35th floor, or taking in the expansive view of London‚Äôs iconic skyline (when the weather permits) is an experience we will not forget in a hurry.  The quality and freshness of seasonal ingredients and flavours made the food items really stand out.   The task of selecting from their extensive menu of signature teas was quite the adventure, but one we enjoyed thoroughly. The Green Gunpowder tea was a favourite.   The genuine care and hospitality of the Tƒ™NG Restaurant staff made our afternoon tea a relaxing and enjoyable experience. Special shout out to Jing who looked after us.  It's the most wonderful time of the year, as the famous Christmas song goes. This afternoon‚Ä¶"

Alex the supervisor was very professional too. The food was outstanding. It reminded us so much of our asian roots and we couldn't be anymore grateful. Really love the team and the food! Highly recommended for a splendid dining experience! 
November 2023,Where to Start,"The Shangri-La London was our last stop on a fabulous 8-week trip for two Aussies seeing the sights and staying in some beautiful places in UK, Scotland & Ireland.  And the Shangri-La The Shard certainly came in tops.  I was slightly apprehensive that with the calibre of the Shangri-La it might be somewhat pretentious.  These thoughts were soon dismissed on arrival. We were greeted by Angelo at the entrance and sped directly to the 35th floor for check-in.  We stayed 5-nights in a Premier Shard Suite on the 42nd floor with of course, stunning views of London.  And the Veuve Clicquot bubbly in the suite was a welcome surprise.  Every night we enjoyed pre-dinner drinks in The Gong (which takes the views of London to an even higher level.  The Staff make the place of course, and‚Ä¶"
November 2023,Not a 5-star experience,"Booked for 4 people, 2 adults, 2 children, as a special occasion (birthday).  There were no beds for the kids in the room when we arrived. We had to call and request two additional beds.  Nothing in the room was catered for 4 people: 2 bath towels only, 2 sets of slippers, 2 bottles of water, etc... . A lot of items in the room/hotel are worn out or damaged. Most of the doors are extremely damaged; it doesn't seem like the staff takes any care.  We made a booking at the Ting restaurant for dinner, we requested a window seat however we were told that it could not be guaranteed; we accepted this.  We asked the concierge to call us 30mn prior to the booking, to confirm whether the request would be met. No one called us. I called the concierge 10 minutes before the reservation time‚Ä¶"

It felt so decadent, a truly wonderful experience with delicacies that just melted in the mouth. Jenny was impeccable and attentive along with the rest of the team that made this experience truly one to remember, and the Shard shaped chocolate with it's dramatic serve over dry ice was so much fun! Absolutely worth every penny! "
October 2023,Cloud 9,"We had the most wonderful stay at Shangri-La after our wedding. We arrived just in time to enjoy the sunsetting. Right from the start the team went out of their way to make our stay a joy, keeping check in short so we could watch London come alive with evening lights.   As you enter, the blinds rise and you are met with the most incredible view of the river and the City. The team are so sweet that they chalk a welcome greeting onto the window to help to make the stay even more memorable   We were spoiled with roses, champagne, chocolates and macaron. Everyone who helped us could not have been more charming, friendly or warm.   We enjoyed all the fantastic facilities that the hotel boasts, especially the swimming pool.

October 2023,Five Star plus experience !,"My wife and I celebrated our 40 th wedding anniversary here . Without a doubt this is the best Shangri  La I have stayed in . Over the years we have been to the Sydney.  Tokyo , Colombo , Hong Kong , Hambantota and Istanbul hotels and this is the best . The facilities are excellent , rooms very comfortable but the approach taken by the staff is the main differentiator . Their approach is that everything is feasible and they will do anything they can to make your stay memorable  . In particular Yannick the reception manager was incredible . Thank you ."
October 2023,Superb!,"My husband surprised me with celebrating our first anniversary in the Shard!  This was a lovely surprise as I never expected it! The stay was amazing and convenient as it is literary on top of London Bridge station. From the moment you enter with a welcoming drink to settling in the room‚Ä¶ everything was absolutely amazing!  My husband and I also loved their A La carte breakfast menu and we truly enjoyed our breakfast with a superb view in the morning (we were lucky the weather was gorgeous to allow us appreciate the view).  The only tiny issue I had at our stay, is when we were out almost for over 6 hours during the day and when we got back the room wasn‚Äôt made‚Ä¶ We called room service who efficiently sent someone to make the room and it was sorted within forty minutes.  All in‚Ä¶"
October 2023,Luxury location - luxury prices,"A luxurious way to spend a weekend in London, if you try to avoid looking at the price! We came here for our first anniversary and were up-sold to a corner room with an amazing view of the city. While I was hoping that they were looking to upgrade us due to the celebration (they instead charged me an extra ¬£100 per night!) I will admit that the room was brilliant. Spacious, modern, but mainly the sweeping panoramic views to die for.  Breakfast was again expensive but high quality. You‚Äôll be looking at ¬£42 per person for the buffet, with an a la carte option with your typical selection of breakfast offerings. We didn‚Äôt eat for dinner while we stayed.  The location is excellent as it is situated directly above London Bridge station - you‚Äôll be able to see most central London‚Ä¶"

We were early as we had just arrived from another hotel after seeing Madonna and we were able to drop our bags and fill out all the necessary paperwork before our room was ready, we were greeted by two absolutely lovely lady receptionists who were so friendly and super efficient, they promised to text when the room was ready ‚Ä¶ which they did!!   Upon getting to our room, after an afternoon of exploring, I was completely blown away! Putting the card in the slot, up came the blinds snd my ‚Ä¶ what a view!!!! We were on floor 49 with a bath with a view and it did not disappoint at all! ‚Ä¶"

September 2023,Gong bar honeymoon ,"Not only is the scenery beautiful and the food delicious, but what's even better is having two excellent bartenders, KYRIAKOS and DAVIDE.

September 2023,Our Server Mathias at the Ting the Shard,"Our experience with Mathias at the Ting was fabulous.

October 2023,"It actually worths 4 stars, the one star taken away is its price","Located in one of the most iconic sites in London, the Shard, The Shangri-la The Shard, London has always been one of the hotels on my bucket list if I ever have a chance to travel to the city.  Now that I have emigrated to the UK and before I have secured a place to rent, I would definitely jump at this opportunity, but does it live up to its hype as one of the most iconic hotels in London, and more important, has it got the wow factor to justify its lofty price even for London five star hotel‚Äôs standard?  Well, sadly, if you are expecting something as bling bling style as the iconic structure of the Shard, you would probably be disappointed, as once you have pass through the very James Bond like security bag search, the place would not be mistaken as another Shangri-la‚Ä¶"
September 2023,Afternoon Tea @Ting,"I had afternoon tea @ TING and it was a 10/10 experience for me.  First, the view- duh! The food was good and the service was great!

It‚Äôs totally worth the price tag, especially if you‚Äôre celebrating something special. "
September 2023,Amazing pink afternoon tea!,"The most amazing pink afternoon tea experience for breast cancer awareness month! Dinil looked after us and was the best! Clearly described all the food to us, his tea recommendations were all spot on as well and he was great company and so attentive.

August 2023,Great stay with an amazing view,"Spent a night at the Shanghai-la Shard in Premier City View room for our anniversary. The hotel is impressive but lacks the grandeur of its 5 star London peers. Unsurprisingly its USP is the view, for which you pay handsomely. The service was great throughout and that really is a plus point across every staff member we encountered.   We ate lunch, dinner and breakfast in Ting (in that order). The five course tasting menu for dinner was good but nothing special. Three out of the five courses were pre-prepared and felt a bit mass produced but the fish and beef courses were excellent. Overall as the main restaurant I thought the hotel could do a lot more to make Ting more atmospheric at night, it‚Äôs too bright and lacking atmosphere, all a bit generic and felt like a classic hotel‚Ä¶"
August 2023,"Afternoon team at Ting, The Shard London ","Great experience today enjoying afternoon team at Ting, The Shard in London.

August 2023,Only the view lived up to expectations‚Ä¶.,"My parents booked to stay to celebrate their 60th wedding anniversary. Having stayed at Shangri-las around the world, they expected a luxurious and special experience. Sadly, it failed to deliver with the exception of the view of the river (which on arrival cost an extra ¬£50).  Despite the hotel not being that old, the room showed signs of wear and use. However, it was spotlessly clean and well designed. The view was incredible from the 44th floor and the binoculars helped!   The hotel were aware they were celebrating their 60th wedding anniversary and had left a bite size piece of cake with ‚ÄòHappy anniversary‚Äô - this was the greatest disappointment. Having stayed at Shangri-las (and other eminent hotels) for lesser occasions, we expected some recognition in-line with its‚Ä¶"

August 2023,Top place to go in London,"The amazing night started with the nicest reception ever, with a instagramable decor. The staff at the entry of the hotel were super welcoming just as the security staff. When we got to the restaurant we got surprised with the spectacular view of London, specially the Tower Bridge, it looked like a painting.  The restaurant staff welcomed us with an amazing champagne. Now the food‚Ä¶. Simply the best that I had for a long time, for starters we had the scallops and the shrimp rolls. I don‚Äôt even have words to describe how delicious it was. Then the main courses, Salmon and the lobster bun super balanced taste and size. We also had the 5 spices beef, and for me was my favorite because the beef just melted in every single bite.   The restaurant staff was so caring with us, always‚Ä¶"

August 2023,"Ting Restaurant, Shangri La, The Shard - great views, amazing food and attentive staff!","As a gift I was given a Virgin Experience voucher for a 3 course meal at the Ting Restaurant at Shangri La, The Shard. We booked for Wednesday 23rd August at 6pm. You have 15 minute time slots between 530pm and 630pm. I went along with one of my friends who had never been to The Shard before and we both used it as a celebration for our birthdays. From the moment we got into the building we were greeted by a lady at the desk who said we could sit on the sofa in the Reception area, which had a beautiful cloud background with butterflies and hot air balloons and beautiful oversized flowers while we waited for our booking time as we had arrived early. This gave us a chance for some lovely photos while we waited which she offered to take of us both.  When our table was ready, she‚Ä¶"

August 2023,"Great food , service and tea",Amazing service and food. Alot to eat so make sure to come hungry. Dave was a great server and had some great recommendations and handled feedback very well. Many desserts all different flavors and a mix of savory and sweet to satisfy different tastes.
August 2023,Dave for the win,It was our first time here and everything was so tasty! The service was impeccable. Dave did a fantastic job as our waiter. His tea suggestions were the best of what we had (get the Mango tea & white apricot!). I highly recommend!
August 2023,Solo tea time,I did the tea time at Ting. Obviously people come for the view but the food and service are perfect as well. My server (Dave) was incredible.

I had the salmon as a Starter and It was absolutely perfect. Mathias was my waiter and he was really really nice! Thank you! The food and Drinks are a bit pricy but for me It was absolutely worth It.
August 2023,Possibly the Best Hotel Service in London,"The service of Shangri-La The Shard is second to none in London.  Right from the porters, concierge, guest relations officers to front desk, every staff serves you from the heart.  And it‚Äôs no lip service.  They all do their works efficiently and in a most helpful manner.   To be frank, they help me find my lost wallet with passport in it.  We would not forget how conscientious, proactive and thoughtful they were in taking care of every aspect during the situation.  Among them, we wish to particularly thank from our hearts Bassam, Iewa, Leah and Mariana, who have done everything for us - checking the driveway and entrance and the Uber driver, providing us with all useful info and speaking all the calm words before we found the wallet.  They took the matter in their hearts and‚Ä¶"
August 2023,Amazing,"Amazing views, atmosphere, food and service. We had the 5 course tasting menu and it was fantastic! Would definitely recommend for a special treat. Thought it was good value for money and the staff were wonderful "
August 2023,Hotel stay review,"Wonderful view as all have mentioned but the hotel needs some repairs.  The faux leather doors to the hotel rooms are so worn, it looks terrible.  The water pressure in the bathroom is low so it‚Äôs takes forever to fill the tub.  The pool area is tiny and jammed with people.  The workout area is small as well.  The room sizes are wonderful though. Overall it was a wonderful stay but the hotel and clientele feel very Michael Kors vs. Dior!"
August 2023,Afternoon Tea at Ting,I had afternoon tea at Ting and Dave was phenomenal! He was attentive and went above and beyond to give the full experience. The food was delicious (and there was more than expected!) Plus the views were incredible! 
July 2023,A wonderful evening with excellent table service.,"A wonderful evening with incredible views of glorious London! The food at Ting was delicious, and the service was impeccable; Mathias, our waiter, went over and beyond to make sure our evening was a success.

From check in with Crystal to check out with Ian our stay was truly exceptional. I think I can happily say that Shangri la London was the best hotel we‚Äôve ever stayed at.   Our rooms were stunning, fantastic views and well appointed. And the bathtub with a view in one of the rooms was a fantastic surprise.   My daughter was truly spoilt by the hotel for her birthday with cakes, soft toys, a balloon, card & birthday message. She said she didn‚Äôt want to go home.   The valet team were also excellent and very kindly took my electric car off to be charged so we could head straight home upon check out.   We all felt truly spoilt during our stay and felt like‚Ä¶"
August 2023,Breakfast with a view,"A warm welcome and breakfast with a view. Served today by Syed with utmost care and a very good service on the start of my day. Thank you. Preferred to be seated on a more quieter area. I have been to other Shangri-La restaurants, which served far better selection of food and variety. Too expensive for the limited amount of food on the buffet. "
August 2023,Gong - Saturday night,"Went to Gong for drinks and food with two friends on a Saturday night l. Excellent service, ambience and music. Mira our waitress was wonderful and so were Davide and Matteius at the bar who gave us each a free shot!"
August 2023,Calm and relaxing.,"Amazing. Greeted out the front and given directions, greeted up stairs by Viola who helped to direct me to my friends who were already here.

The staff ensured my nephew had a birthday to remember, thank you again for some wonderful memories. "
July 2023,Faultless,"Incredible experience. Attention to detail is second to none. Staff are super helpful and attentive. Rooms are wonderful and comfortable. Views of London are mind blowing, especially in the evening. Cannot wait to return!"
July 2023,Spectacular,"We are devotees of The Savoy but my husband was very keen to try Shangri-La for his 40th birthday. It does not disappoint. Staff went out of their way to make the occasion special and there were some lovely little gestures left. It is a spectacular place with breathtaking views. The infinity pool is especially worth a visit. The only thing I would ask is that they get their billing right- as a a Circle Member, I did not want to have to highlight what we had included upon checkout. They did very promptly sort it though. Fab. Throughly recommended."
July 2023,A special and luxurious treat,"We visited Ting at The Shard for dinner and arrived right at 5:30 when it opened. We were given a window table and while the the views were spectacular (the main event, really), the service was equally superb.  Dave was our server and he was responsive, helpful and kind. He seemed to anticipate all of our needs and was always at the table right away.  He even managed to make a ‚Äúgrown up dinner‚Äù accessible to our 8 year old by highlighting the Top your Own Sundae option, with fruit and chocolate, which, of course, we had to get.  In short, while this was certainly a splurge, it seemed a worthwhile and luxurious way to spend a celebratory evening in London. I would highly recommend to those seeking a special treat."
July 2023,An iconic evening at an iconic hotel,"I struggle to explain with words how simply amazing this hotel and the facilities are, each time I visit it feels like the first again, discovering new views and exploring what the hotel has to offer. Having previously stayed at this hotel and multiple Shangri-La hotels and being blown away by the service, attention to detail and luxury of the hotels, I couldn‚Äôt wait to return - this time I returned for a friends birthday celebrations. On returning I instantly felt at home, with the addition of the super friendly, helpful staff being on hand. With the pool being the party location, the views were, as always, unmatched, the drinks were extraordinary and the atmosphere was unrivalled, all expertly created by the wonderful staff at the hotel. Another fantastic night hosted by the‚Ä¶"
July 2023,Beautiful food,Our waiter Dave was fantastic and attentive he waited while we took photos before he served the first course. Only note was that wine ordered at the beginning came out later than expected from another server. 
July 2023,4 night stay in an iconic London landmark!!,"Room is large, has a great view of London and bathroom is stunning. The hotel itself and the public areas however, did not feel as luxurious as expected. The entrance at street level feels like an airport hotel with queues for lifts  which always seemed packed. The lobby had a similar feel and does not feel particularly welcoming or exclusive.  Staff do not seem that friendly apart from the porters. You are paying to stay in a landmark, which is a lovely experience, but it means crowds in the bars etc so you loose the feeling of coming back to a warm hospitable retreat at the end of the day. We feel there are better hotels in London in this price range. It takes more than the building to create that feeling of exclusive 5 star hospitality."
July 2023,Wife‚Äôs Birthday at TING,"We came her for my wife‚Äôs birthday and Dave provided an excellent service. From the moment we sat down to even service of the meal, he went above and beyond to enjoy we were comfortable and had an amazing time. He was also understanding in going out of his way to ensure we had a great window view, we made all the birthday extra experience. Thanks Dave and highly recommend the venue "

July 2023,"Fantastic view of the Tower Bridge and the Belfast on a breezy, foggy afternoon for High Tea. The food was immaculate!","Outstanding service, delicate teas, and imaginative desserts with surprising textures were delightful for our family! A quintessential high tea with modern twists accented by the expansive view 35 stories above the London skyline. Wonderful!"
June 2023,"Delicious food, great service, great views.",Had anniversary dinner at Ting. Provided us with window table even though very busy. Our server Dave was very friendly and helpful. He even stopped us from ordering too much food. Food was delicious. Will have to come back to try the beef short ribs next time! Most dishes are halal which was an added bonus.

After dinner Syed kindly accommodated us at a table by the window for a more wonderful view‚Ä¶..It was an evening to remember !! "
July 2023,Special Treat and few days in London,"Fantastic hotel, real treat to stay here. Amazing views of the river and across London.   We had two adjoining rooms with kids in one room and even they enjoyed the views!!  As one would expect fantastic service as always from Shangri-La!   Top floor restaurant was a little underwhelming, perhaps as view from room was better.   Pool beautiful but could only take a handful of people and had to book for kids to attend."
July 2023,Syed can make it special!!,"Syed was pure joy to serve and advise! Perfect service quietly, quickly, just right. How can anyone rate this place less than perfect!  Delightful presentation, prawns and beef, special treats. Views!"
July 2023,Lovely Hotel and people but fundamental issue needs looking into,"Let me first off start by saying that The hotel attentiveness and attention to detail is unrivalled. I booked a celebration in the cloud experience which was truly delightful. The timing for the delivery of the champagne was brilliant, The message on the window and decorations all had my girlfriend very happy. Now, the stay was lovely. We had a deluxe city view which was great. (I'd say always opt for a city view) if possible. I've also stayed In a Premier city view room before. The difference being, the Premier room has and extra side window for additional lighting / views and a bit more space overall. The food at ting for the 5 course taster meal really nice. The breakfast buffet was absolutely brilliant. The spa and pool was also nice - just ensure you make a booking during‚Ä¶"

July 2023,"Greta hotel, terrible booking experience.","An amazing hotel, but I booked this stay as a birthday present for my daughter and despite being clear that I wanted to pay for everything in advance, it took several messages before they managed to accommodate this. To top it all off, I also preauthorised an amount on my credit card which they have not fully refunded and are still trying to locate in order to pay me the balance back. Some of the worst, most shambolic booking service that I have ever experienced from a hotel."
July 2023,Great tea with great service,"Jenny was a great server, she took fantastic care of us.  And the live music was a wonderful accompaniment. Tea was delicious. The desserts were all amazing but the start of the show was the truffle egg salad sandwich. It was to die for!"

June 2023,Love it! Thank You Freddy for Serving Us!,"It‚Äôs a must-have experience if you want to have afternoon tea in London. The elevator will take you up to the 35th floor and the view is astonishing once you walk in. I took my daughter there, and that was her first experience in London and with afternoon tea, and she loved it! Our server, Freddy, was very patient and friendly. He made sure we understood the menu, and took fully care of us so we enjoyed the tea time with no worries at all! Love it! "
June 2023,Sky High,"The views from the room were magnificent.  The rooms were spacious and clean, with very comfortable beds.  I thought check-in was a bit weak in that it took a while to be ready, and once it was finally ready, our bags weren't in them.  The room keys malfunctioned numerous times over the course of three days (I would estimate that we went through a total of 18 different room keys.)  It was an expensive stay, but the bellinis in reception were a nice touch.  "
June 2023,Great Exposure- Afternoon Tea,"The service was really amazing provided by Mathias & Manuel. Keep up the good work! I look forward to come to Shard to relive this moment again.

June 2023,"Nice hotel, great location. Great views of London but really overpriced.","Have wanted to stay in this hotel for ages saved it for my wife‚Äôs 40th birthday and we made a night of it booking dinner at the romantic table in the restaurant which came out an extra cost but was worth it for the views. Have to say the food wasn‚Äôt great, and we expected more, especially for the price Hotel rooms great views all over London which were spectacular, the spa is also nice on the 52nd floor but you have to book and they ask you to get changed in your room and walk past a busy restaurant in a robe which wasn‚Äôt good but overall nice but the cost really wasn‚Äôt worth it for the overall stay  We stayed in many hotels around the world, this one‚Äôs lovely, but just really overpriced We spent over ¬£1300 for 1 night with dinner and a bottle of wine which is outrageous  Lucky‚Ä¶"

I had not planned to do it here beforehand, but the night was made to feel so special that I proposed to my partner here (luckily she said yes!). The customer service from the moment we walked into The Shard was excellent. It is an intimate setting with fantastic views out on to London. The sun set while we were there, which led to some lovely viewing during our meal. I had the burger for my main and I am not exaggerating when I say it is the best burger I have ever eaten! The price is on the expensive side, but that is to be expected for the experience. Compared to other menus I saw in The Shard, Sky Lounge were quite fair. We both had a main, a dessert, a drink, a bottle of water for the table and paid the service charge - this‚Ä¶"
May 2023,Guest Relations very disapointing,"So disappointed, this was our 3rd visit to Shangri-La Shard in a year and always spoke well of the hotel but guest relations left us very disapointed. Guest Relations had swiped our card twice when we made a payment unbeknown to us. When my husband went to the bank to withdraw some money he couldn't because  Shangri-La had there second payment impending. So we had no money in our account. I phoned Guest Relations and explained there mistake I was told that someone would ring me back but they didn't . I phoned Guest Relations and again I was told that someone would ring me or email me later that day, I heard nothing from them. On the 3rd day I phoned my bank because we do not have Internet banking so was not aware if the payment had been sent back  the payment was sent back into‚Ä¶"

May 2023,Totally Incompetent Management,After a previous disaster we decided to give this Hotel a second chance ???  It‚Äôs worse we are still waiting after one hour at 3 pm to gain access to a very expensive suite and things have got worse  The Front of House Manager is incompetent and clearly lost  Never ever again a very poor reflection on a great Brand  Ian Kinga Lily

Manuel the sommelier picked 3 wines for me to complement the 5 course experience, and each one made the experience even better. Both Elvis and Manuel were very kind and thoughtful and made me feel so welcome. My dinner at T√éNG was the highlight of my stay at the Shangri-La. The sky pool was also a great experience.

May 2023,*PLEASE READ* Hotel amazing - but be CAREFUL with what you get charged for,"I had a fantastic stay - hotel is amazing, staff very friendly, hotel itself is high quality as you would expect for a hotel of this calibre and price. However, how this hotel handles your money is very poor - I highly recommend you are very cautious and keep a close eye on transactions. I paid the full room rate on check in of over ¬£1700 with a debit card. First issue - they add on a 5% service charge, so the amount you are told when booking, make sure you add on 5% which they don't tell you about (I was quoted ¬£1620 and got charged ¬£1701). Secondly, they tried putting a pre-authorisation of ¬£400 on top when I checked in. I disputed this, eventually they agreed not to - but they completely emptied the mini bar before we were allowed in the room...As if I am going to steal a‚Ä¶"

You can tell they are highly trained and are basically experts in hospitality. They do their best to remember any issues/orders/allergies you may have. It‚Äôs lovely to see people just shining in their jobs they way they do. They address you by name, try to be discrete. They‚Äôre excellent.  The rooms are lovely, large, spotless and of course the views (you already know). They surprise you throughout your stay with high quality snacks and chocolate. üòç Pampered.  Breakfast buffet was amazing. High quality produce served. High quality dishes served with a lovely range.   Beautiful pool area.

May 2023,World class experience,"I've been fortunate enough to stay in quite a few nice hotels and after a while you start to get a feel for what a 5* experience actually is, regardless of how many stars they claim to have. Shangri-La Shard can certainly walk the walk. (My only criticism is that the door to our room and a few others had a sort of leather covering, which is peeling, but that didn't diminish our experience once inside the room.)  So what made it so good? The views. The views. The views. Most of the walls -- as you'd expect -- are glass and we enjoyed the most spectacular sunset. On to the bathroom: good bathroom products (L'Occitane!), perfect placement of the bath for that wow factor -- panoramic views of London while you soak --  and even the toilet! It always warm and it even washes your‚Ä¶"
May 2023,Hues of Culture !!,"We went with my family to have some drinks, we tried the new menu that was launched today and recommandation from the bartenders Kyriakos and Dani were the best!

April 2023,Nice view but overall disappointing,Rooms below par cleanliness  Overall finish of rooms not great and starting to look tired  Told we had breakfast then upon  arrival refused which was embarrassing  Overall not the experience we were expecting and will be looking to stay elsewhere in future in our return to London 
May 2023,Anniversary night,"Well what can I say, this place certainly didn't disappoint.from the moment we pulled up in a car, to the ease of check in, the friendliness and accommodating staff to the most exquisite room I've ever stayed in. The decor around the whole establishment was fantastic, the room itself was out of this world with  stunning views. The bed was mahoosive, I thought I'd lost my wife in it when I woke up and couldn't see her. The automatic blinds are a great touch and nake you feel you're staying somewhere special. The bath in the bathroom is first class, and the views you get whilst sitting in it are stunning. The heated automatic toilet is something else. The only gripe I have about the room is that the windows on the outside of the structure needed a good clean in places as the dirt‚Ä¶"

April 2023,Surprise for my Wife,"I booked this as a surprise for my Wife and have to say it was worth every penny. We stayed for 2 nights on level 45 overlooking St Pauls Cathedral from the bedroom. The customer service in this hotel is excellent, from the moment we checked in nothing was too much trouble. We were made to feel special and that's rare these days even in so called 5 star hotels. The room was immaculate and we were fortunate to have a bath by the window. Would highly recommend requesting this even if it costs extra. Yes this hotel is expensive but its a unique experience and one that will never be forgotten. Will we return? Definitely. One of the finest hotels in the world without doubt. "

The food was amazing the cocktails were great, we have been looked after by Madalina who is the floor manager and her colleague Anbu. I can not express in words how grateful I was about the service and the mesmerising view of London from the 52‚Äônd floor.

Guess what - no check in at 4pm - room isn‚Äôt ready! They can‚Äôt get a hold of housekeeping either conveniently!  So we had to sit and wait with a child.  The sad part is it wasn‚Äôt just us, I noticed so many different people having the exact same conversation with the check in staff.

She was on top of everything, professional, & the service was fast. There was great live music being sung during our meal also!

Firstly, this month‚Äôs theme was Breast Cancer Awareness and the Shangri-La did it perfectly! Not only were the decorations beautiful, but the afternoon tea had a pink theme with pink sandwiches, cakes and scones, as well as a spiced pear and white chocolate shard cake (which was both beautiful and delicious!) Everything was made perfectly, and I found myself eating foods I wouldn‚Äôt usually eat because they somehow managed to make everything taste so good!  Additionally, the service was absolutely incredible from the moment we walked through the door. A special shout-out to our amazing server Kiro who looked after us from start to finish, he didn‚Äôt rush us and constantly made sure‚Ä¶"

My Daughter had her 21st Birthday last year which  was beyond Amazing and this year we went back to have Afternoon Pink Tea.  Truly Special and couldn't do enough for us like every visit we have.

Thank you so much again for our Special Celebration we look forward to seeing to very soon.  Many Thanks  Mrs Penny Hart"
October 2022,Staying at the Hotel,"Since I stepped in the Hotel to do my check-in Archi helped me with my booking and gave to me all the information that i needed with a warm welcoming. After it I had some drinks at Ting Restaurant, Carlos and Emilo looked after me and my brother. Later on that day I had dinner at Ting with my brother and cousin and the staff there was very accommodating. Kiro and Leon gave us a very wonderful service also in the end with some dry ice.

October 2022,Shangri-La the shard,The hotel is spectacular for views and rooms however let down with slightly off customer service. I cannot fault much of our visit except on a couple of times having no so good interactions with the hotel staff. Again the hotel is in a fantastic position and great to use as a base to explore this fabulous area of London.
October 2022,Beautiful lunch with a view,Amazing views of London. Great service (thanks Elvis). Lovely lunch with the family. Highly recommend as a treat if you‚Äôre in London. Had the 3 course lunch menu which was enjoyable. Good selection of children‚Äôs options was appreciated too. Next time we‚Äôll try the afternoon tea.
October 2022,Afternoon Tea,"Everyone has recommended afternoon tea here at the shard. I was skeptical at first - a view is nice, but was it worth the trip? Absolutely. Even though I had no reservations, the friendly staff fit my wife and I in for afternoon tea. The view was stunning: a large window overlooking tower bridge. The food was excellent (my wife went with the vegan option and I enjoyed the traditional fare). Tea tasted delicious and staff kept it flowing. Portions were surprisingly filling (we took a to go box). Our waiter stopped by to talk with us; he was friendly and gave us some pointers on sites to see. Overall, a very relaxing once in a lifetime stop. Highly recommend"

THANK YOU SYED! "
October 2022,Afternoon Tea Experience @ the Ting‚Äôs,"Where else would I like to spend an afternoon tea experience of a lifetime but from where the afternoon tea originated itself. Plus an aerial view of the city of London hence the choice of having it only at the Shangri-La The Shard London last October 3, 2022 visit despite other best selections of venue. One of my bucket list was checked off. The sets of food served from savory sandwiches to beautifully assembled desserts were delicious & the unlimited refills of any tea selections were refreshing. The request for the smoky effect on our table was an added flair too. To top it all, the optional request for having a table by the window during the reservation was granted despite the hesitancy of the lady at the reception even when it‚Äôs available was questionable. But with the‚Ä¶"

September 2022,Excellent but be aware!,"We stayed here for 2 nights in the middle of September for our Wedding Anniversary, this was the 4th or 5th time we had stayed at this hotel.  We had a superior room on the 46th Floor overlooking Tower Bridge, this was more spacious than the standard room. Excellent views from our room, and the room was as it should be.  On the positive side, we were able to check in at 2.00pm which I had requested prior to checkin.  The stay itself was excellent, the views are unrivalled, service whilst staying was excellent, breakfast was good and the staff in the Gong Bar provided excellent service.  But on the negative side we had a couple of issues...  1) I had booked the skyline lounge for Saturday night about six weeks prior to our stay, and 5 days before our arrival I had an email to say‚Ä¶"

September 2022,A wonderful trip to the Shard,"From the moment we arrived at the Shard, we were warmly greeted by everyone. The doormen kindly showed us to the lifts which would take us to the hotel reception. The hotel is immaculate, with beautiful decor! We headed to the restaurant for a coffee and some food, and we‚Äôre greeted by Alexandra & Fiona at the front desk who were both so welcoming and interested in our plans for London.  Jenny showed us to our table which had a fabulous view over the city of London - something which I had been looking forward to seeing. What can I say about Jenny - her enthusiasm was beyond anything I had imagined. Jenny was joined by Emilio, who both served us during our time at the Shard. No request was too much, and they were always delighted to help in whatever way they could. The restaurant‚Ä¶"

I ordered the express breakfast at Ting for less than the ticket cost of either the other options. The food was fantastic. Three types of fresh pastries was served and they were delicious. The server even offered me some jam to go with them which was really good. The fruit salad was made up of a selection of fresh berries and tasted great while mixed with the yogurt. I finished my tea and to my surprise I was offered a refill at no addition cost! The view was amazing as well.

September 2022,Drinks only,We visited the gong lounge at the chard for drinks and had a great experience. We only went for drinks but they also provide 4 different kinds of complimentary nuts.

Special thanks to Kyle who just started working here but was a great waiter.
September 2022,Afternoon tea at the shard,We enjoyed  a wonderful afternoon tea with our waiter Kiro. We even had our little baby with us in a stroller which was no problem.

September 2022,Avoid at all costs,"Would NEVER stay here again. I was hoping that the central location would outweigh any issues with hotel but sadly not. Totally grim room. Terrible customer service, reception put the phone down on me when I asked to move rooms because of the noise. When I phoned back I was told ‚Äò I don‚Äôt know what your problem is‚Äô!!  The noise is horrendous, you ca best every movement in rooms each side, above and below. Avoid at all costs!!!"
September 2022,"Unique view, with a delicious cocktail menu","The view? You‚Äôll struggle to top that in London.

Even being a regular Joe, I was well looked after."

September 2022,We recommend the Shard.,"HOTEL This might be one of the most modern places we‚Äôve stayed in in a long while.  The thick plush carpets lining the hallways and continuing into your room are thicker and more plush than we‚Äôve experienced almost anywhere (maybe the Ritz in Paris compares). We had a suite, so not sure about standard rooms, but the suite was quite spacious. The views are amazing. You‚Äôre 35+ stories up over London so you get pretty unobstructed views of the city. The cabinetry, the lights, the bathrooms the whole thing feels like a well throughout and well-built modern hotel. The finishes feel solid and not cheap, the toilets have heated seats and bidets with a large programmable panel on the wall, heated towel racks and more‚Ä¶everything is just a notch higher than most 5-star hotels we‚Äôve been‚Ä¶"
September 2022,Best service from an excellent server,"Eglantino was an absolutely star of a server! He was attentive and professional! Best experience I‚Äôve ever had.  Thank you so much for the excellent Service Eglantino, you were magnificent! My husband and I loved the photos you took of us and also how friendly you were!"
September 2022,Fantastic from start to finish,"We stayed as a couple for the weekend. Great room, 360 views. Dinner at Oblix was unbelievable, best steak I‚Äôve ever eaten. Service impeccable from reception to server to manager. Had a tiny issue with the tv, somebody was knocking at our door within 5 minutes. Resolved instantly. Reception staff brilliant and genuinely friendly. Valet guys are very helpful.  The only tiny improvement i would make ( if being picky) would be that the spa/ pool be a bigger area as did feel a bit ‚Äú on top of eachother ‚Äú. Would definitely stay again."
September 2022,Eglantinu,"Eglantine looked after us at the Ting restaurant at the Shard,  He was very friendly,  took great photo‚Äôs an absolute gem.  I hope he gets rewarded for his hard work and commitment,   Thank you again Eglantino. Diane and John Walker"

September 2022,Excellent Champagne Cream Tea,You would expect a cream tea at the Shangri-La to be excellent and it was together with those stunning views of London from the 31 floor of the Shard. The icing on the cake (no pun intended) was that it was an anniversary celebration and it was made to feel special. Many thanks to Kiro and staff who looked after us
September 2022,High Tea experience!,"We recently went to the Ting restaurant at this facility for a High Tea. We were celebrating my birthday in London and had booked this place for an afternoon Tea experience.

August 2022,"Exceptional service, fantastic food and  stunning views!","I've stayed at The Shard several times over the past few months and was astounded by the quality of the service, food and scenic views. On all occasions, save my last stay, I had the pleasure of being checked-in and checked-out by Marta Martin, an incredible receptionist at the from desk. I mentioned to her I was a photographer and she called up at sunset to advise to come to the lobby to view the amazing scenic views. I really appreciate her personal touch. My last stay unfortunately, was not as pleasant on the service end but I am treating that as an anomaly for now.  The food at the Ting is to die for! I would suggest the Ting Burger and Chicken Cesar - combined they are simply exquisite. It is quite odd as the room service Ting Burger and Cesar Salad seemed more flavourful‚Ä¶"
August 2022,"Great service, lovely views and exciting  cocktails","We visited Gong to celebrate our dad's birthday. It was a great evening.  The cocktails were innovative and views were great. To top everything the service was exceptional. We were seated by Alina who was extremely kind.  Alina gave us a great table and ensured our parents had a wonderful time.   We often remember the venue and the drinks, but Alina ensured we remembered her kindness during our visit.   Highly recommend Gong's innovative and signature cocktails.   Thank you Alina, Connor, Anbu for a great evening."

Zain"
August 2022,A must experience when in London.,"Do not miss out on this! Besides from the breathtaking view and beautiful interior, Shangri-la is a restaurant with the highest quality in all aspects.

August 2022,Utopia in vibrant London,We stayed with our young family in two connecting rooms on the 42nd floor. Superb view of the city. Spacious rooms and the connection through the hallway (which we could lock with an extra door) made it even more comfortable. Kids were provided with funny and entertaining set of toys. All required amenities available. Delightful pool with kids hours and off course brilliant view
August 2022,Amazing Afternoon Tea,We have just had the most amazing Afternoon Tea at Tring Restaurant The Shard. The sandwiches and cakes were out of this world. It was my husband‚Äôs birthday so it was a special occasion. Our waitress called Jenny was outstanding. From the moment we arrived she went out of her way to make us feel welcome and anything we asked for was not a problem. My son is a bit of a fussy eater and only likes egg sandwiches. Jenny made sure he had plenty and nothing was too much trouble. I can honestly say she made our experience so fantastic. She was truly exceptional and she is a real credit to Tring. The whole experience from the window seat to the food was superb and we will definitely be back. We highly recommend!! Thank you
August 2022,The Sky lounge The Shard,"The Sky Lounge in the Shard London has the most excellent staff. I dealt with a professional young member of the team Paulo, he was considerate, attentive and so helpful infact with the knowledge that it was my daughters 21st bday he informed me of a service they could offer. He organised a cake to be made informing me of the size and price in advance and checked my daughters name( unusual spelling) to make sure it was correct. His greeted us personally on the day and his staff were outstanding! Couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough, well done and thank youüëçüèª"
August 2022,Luxury with a view,"I grew up in London and thought I‚Äôd seen it all. But after returning after five years away in Sydney, the Shangri-La has given me a new perspective on my home city. The service is immaculate from check-in with Sonia to check-out with a hundred exquisite details in between. I could sit and drink cocktails on the 52nd floor for hours, spotting places I‚Äôve visited over the years as the sun goes down. Thank you."
August 2022,The service and the food was good all round from beginning to end. Would recommend others to go and try Shanghai-La.,This was a great experience from beginning to end. From first greeting to being tabled. The food was well prepared. Delivered and the staff are well knowledgeable about what is being provided. I would recommend to try if visiting london. Atleast once.

October 2021,Shagri-La TING lunch experience: excellent and highly recommended!,"The two of us have joined the Shangri-La restaurant: TING, for a wonderful lunch experience.  The friendly host showed us to our table with stunning views boasting over central London. Then the star of the show: Carlos, the supervisor waiter came, which introduced himself and briefly told us what delicacies await us.  We throughly enjoyed the food, views, and overall experience; and Carlos always checked if we was happy and asking whether he can help us.  All in all, would definitely recommend coming along to TING, and recommend the ‚Äú3 Course Menu‚Äù with a well varied choice selection, as well as the fantastic teas.  Excellent experience with fantastic views."
August 2022,Fantastic stay for a 70th celebration,"We had 3 rooms here for a surprise 70th celebration and had a wonderful time. The staff were all very helpful in the run up to the stay organising balloons and cakes etc. Our 3 rooms were a city view, the bigger city view and a London suite which was an upgrade for us with 2 children (thank you!!)  Theyd made so much effort with champagne, cookies, cakes, toys for the kids, birthday cake, truffles!!! They went above and beyond and let us get into 2 of the rooms 2 hours early.  Swimming slots have to be booked in advance so it doesn‚Äôt over crowd which was fine and children can swim 9-11, 3-5pm. The staff at the pool were very accommodating and always on hand to help. It‚Äôs slippy though, my daughter fell over twice   We ate at Aqua Shard next door which was fab, but chose not to‚Ä¶"

August 2022,Fabulous views - Thanks Shangri-La,"We stayed in one of the suites for our anniversary. The view was ASTOUNDING. We were able to see the sun rise and sun set from either side of the room with the panoramic views which made it extra special. We dined at the restaurants and bar within the hotel, we had a lovely dinner with live piano played in the background, great atmosphere and ambience. The infinity pool was fabulous and views again were amazing. It‚Äôs a rather expensive stay but I think we‚Äôll worth the ¬£¬£¬£¬£ if you want to make some special memories."

August 2022,Amazing venue and service to celebrate our 2 year anniversary,"Brilliant room, swimming pool and gym. All on level 51, wow all glass to see the views. The room was spacious and the bathroom with views is great. Colleagues were so helpful. They even keep your preference on your information, so they can get everything you want ready. Like type of room best floor ect."
August 2022,It was big pleasure to receive the service by Leon.,Stunning interior and food. Our kind waiter Kiro the hero managed to move our table so we could have dinner with a view. He was very accommodating as well as funny. Definitely recommend booking to celebrate a special occasion. I recommend going just before sunset so you can see the day to night view.
August 2022,Unbeatable views of London & superb service.,"Leon gave us the best service and made our last day in London more special and happier. Thanks to Leon, the meal became a memorable memory for a longer period of time. The food was delicious, too. I want to go again on my next visit to London. It would be even more so with Leon."
August 2022,Very good visit fantastic,"Such a wonderful stay. We came for our anniversary and couldn‚Äôt have been better taken care of. Such a warm welcome and the Receptionist Marta who was amazing even sent flowers to our room.   We had drinks and food at Gong and watching the bar man make cocktails was nearly as good as the view. There were even seats by the pool to enjoy a drink.   Even if you can‚Äôt stay here I would suggest rather than going to the Shard viewing platform come here for a drink, you get much better value for money. The views are amazing wherever you look.   Our bedroom was on the corner over looking St Pauls and was stunning day and night. Watching the city light up was just lovely.   When you arrive in your room the blinds lift for a real wow effect.   As it was a special occasion I think we were‚Ä¶"
August 2022,Amazing,Kiro was fantastic server. He was so lovely. They let us pray somewhere private. My friends were treated with such respect and kindness. I would come back here again and again for the service alone. Lovely visit

The best afternoon tea we‚Äôve had, they have such a great selection of food, definitely something for everyone! The view was also fabulous to look out on whilst enjoying our afternoon together. The staff were so lovely and very helpful, especially Jing!  Will be returning definitely!"
August 2022,Disappointing,"Views aside, the Hotel was disappointing. The rooms are looking tired, there is a price hike on everything (which I understand to some extent but everything you touch costa money‚Ä¶as if the rooms weren‚Äôt expensive enough). The shower leaked, the plug socket was broken and we expected more modern tech (streaming Netflix at the least). I guess it is similar to buying luxury clothes, there‚Äôs only so much value until you‚Äôre getting the same quality but paying for the name. There was nothing special about this Hotel and I regret spending so much money on what was supposed to be an extraordinary anniversary celebration."
August 2022,Amazing service and views,"Awesome service and amazing views! Hotel service is amazing, concierge is very helpful and accommodating, they let me leave my golf clubs at the hotel for a few weeks while i travelled around europe.  The views are amazing particularly as it was my first time to London."
August 2022,Wedding Present - Champagne Afternoon Tea,Ting restaurant in The Shangri La @ The Shard London.

We would both highly recommend anyone to experience Ting Restaurant as all the staff were unbelievably helpful and friendly. Thank you for a great afternoon.

Food and desserts were simply delectable ! Kiro, who served us, was very thoughtful and brilliant üëè !

When we arrived everyone was extremely helpful and when they found out we were already late for our brunch booking at Aqua, the reception staff made even more effort to quickly explain our benefits (booked through concierge to receive Golden Circle benefits) and send us on our way.  When we finished our brunch, the room was ready and we were informed that they upgraded us to a suite. When you enter your room at the Shangri-la, the curtains open to unveil the view of London.

June 2022,Splendid Shard,"Certainly one of the best hotels in london, and the view is a literal standout of the best lot  Check-in was good and when i enquired about upgrade, the answer was unhelpful - ‚Äúyou‚Äôve already got the best suite‚Äù. Which is obviously not true  The staff from porters, conceirge, restaurant etc. are all very good  The suite is very nice with expectedly amazing views  The pool is indoor , small and not for laps. Gym also small with the great views  Location wise, seems 30 mins from everywhere so the taxi bills piled up. And 45 min from Harrods  Almost perfect 7 day stay then something odd happened on the last evening. We found the cleaning staff slumped on our bathroom floor. She managed to get up and at our door , collapsed again. Our room was in some disarray. We called the front‚Ä¶"

Emilio and Danny surprised us with a special ‚Äúhappy anniversary‚Äù chocolate on our dessert, and Nathaniel finished the night off with a gift of a special drink atop a dry ice display that was amazing.  The whole experience was exceptional and I would like to extend my thanks to the whole team, as well as the chefs for preparing the amazing food.  Thanks again, Nick and Jack"
June 2022,Afternoon tea in Ting,"Stunning location.  All staff are just 1st class. Special mention to Vincent who was so attentive, knowledgeable, professional yet friendly. The menu is so informative, vast selection of teas. Food was Stunning, so flavoursome and beautifully presented. Lovely live music playing subtly in the corner."
May 2022,Fabulous,Amazing experience with a view !! Sensational service and the sommelier there helped us so much choosing our wine for our 5 course meal which was delightful. I would definitely recommend here . Hopefully be back here again soon!
June 2022,Was absolutely amazing best experience,I honestly couldn't of asked for a better date to celebrate my 6 months with my boyfriend the food was amazing and the view was even better we had a spectacular waiter called kiro who went the extra mile to make this day so romantic for us. Worth every penny !!!
June 2022,Afternoon Tea at TING Restaurant and Lounge,"I enjoyed very much the afternoon tea at the TING. The hostess, Jenny was extremely friendly and helpful. The food was quite a lot, which I couldn‚Äôt finish. Highly recommend for those who are looking for a first time experience of afternoon tea."
June 2022,THE VIEW,Top-notch concierge service! We stayed in one of the corner rooms with a view of St. Paul's and west. The free-standing bathtub faced Big Ben. The pool and sauna are next to none although I have to say a 45min slot can make someone feel stressed. Only disappointment was the room service. We oredered a bottle of champagne which took 40min to arrive and then they wanted to add tray charge and service charge on top of that. That's basically a tip on tip. We mentioned it during check-out and it was removed immediately. I highly recommend to every Londoner to stay here for one night at least once in their lives! The view is a fantastic experience!
June 2022,Excellent views although the hotel is looking dated,perhaps the reason to choose the Shard are the views - you can't bet these. I stayed two nights in a room on the 46th floor. I found the room wasn't perfectly clean. There was dust on the furniture and items didn't look like they were stored after being cleaned - ie the iron with the cord hanging out the wardrobe. The doors are extremely worn - the fabric/leather overlay is ripping of the front of most doors I walked past.   The service was however consistent with the Shangri La brand
June 2022,Claudia,"Tanveer was our event operation supervisor and was utterly amazing, so attentive and helpful! Couldn‚Äôt recommend more. He explained everything and was always around for anything we needed utter star!   Thank you"
December 2021,Wonderful afternoon tea experience!,"Loved the tea surprise (we won‚Äôt spoil it for you). Danny our server was very hospitable.

June 2022,Delayed Xmas Treat,"Had a much awaited lunch at Shangri La restaurant, a gift from one of our children for last Xmas. Not sure what was most fabulous‚Ä¶the visit to the Shard or the meal itself. From our welcome when we went into the hotel until we left we couldn‚Äôt have asked for more . The food was delicious and the service top class from all staff. Our waiter Elvis, was attentive, knowledgeable and an absolute pleasure to talk to‚Ä¶a real professional. Thank you Elvis‚Ä¶please don‚Äôt leave this building! A great all round experience."

June 2022,Amazing experience,"My partner received this as a birthday Virgin voucher gift. We have had bad experiences with Virgin Vouchers the food is not always the best!   To say it was an amazing evening doesn‚Äôt even explain.   Vincent (our waiter) and Irene, our sommelier, ( I hope I have spelt your name correctly) were second to none in making our experience amazing. Both so friendly and knowledgeable and nothing was too much. They made my partner‚Äôs birthday extra special. Thank you both so much. I highly recommend this for the amazing food and the best service. Thank you for a great evening. We will definitely be back xx"

June 2022,Shout out to those who have pride in their job,"Had an amazing experience, despite being late and not the most Welcoming of receiving staff, they were outshone by both Nathaniel the Sommelier, who personally took time away from his designated role to see that we were accommodated promptly and Made to feel most Welcome.  He checked on us and spent time answering any questions as well as capturing the special moments and ensuring we were happy.

May 2022,Booked for a special night out.,"Not sure why it has taken me so long to write this review!!  I wanted to stay somewhere special for my 50th birthday last year after all the hell of the previous year or so, and the Shang ri la did not disappoint.  The room and view was amazing, and the staff could not have done more to help or make me feel special, including a lovely little delivery of a birthday cake.    Three of us shared a room as a base for our night out, and I opted to sleep on what can only be described as the most comfortable z bed I‚Äôve ever slept in.  Going to sleep to that view is incredible and quite possibly one of the best nights of sleep I‚Äôve had.  Whilst pricey, if you have the money and want to do something special, go for it."

I emailed the gong SSL and received a reply from Edward within a short period of time and he confirmed that they could accommodate our numbers. Great that part of the occasion dealt with professionally and timely.  I then wanted to book a celebration cake for my wife and time was running out. The website asked me to email a certain email address.

April 2022,40th birthday celebration,We booked breakfast prior to going to the top of the Shard. We had a very warm welcome from the start.

Jing/Jenny made our visit very special as we celebrated my sister‚Äôs 40th birthday. Thank you all so very much!
April 2022,Nice view,"I absolutely loved the view from our room , the bathroom was the cherry on top. I must say staying in the Shard was on my check list for a quite long time. However, does the room justify the ¬£600 I paid per night, I really don‚Äôt think so."

I think the best parts of the stay was the skyline views, the delicious food & excellent staff ( In particular Mr Nathaniel Morales who provided especially great service during the stay.)  Thank you Shangri-La London for looking after us."
April 2022,Good experience but..........,".........very significantly overpriced in my view. Been planning to try a night here for a while. Whilst everything is beautifully designed, the staff and service very good, the rooms nice and the views spectacular there is much, much better value to be had in London. I won't detail the good stuff as it's quite obvious, but a couple of niggles. Firstly the spa is small, and was quite noisy with children despite me deliberately booking a slot after the 'children's hours'. Secondly, literally everything has to be booked in advance - when paying upwards of ¬£600 (room-only) in any establishment it's not unreasonable to expect to have access to most if not all facilities when you want. As a result you can't do anything spontaneous. Glad we tried it and enjoyed the experience, but‚Ä¶"
April 2022,A amazing place,"Had a fabulous time at the Shard today for my daughters birthday. We started at the Viewing Gallery with its fantastic views, had a cocktail from the bar and a laugh with one of the bar staff ( sorry didn‚Äôt get your name,  the guy who is studying photography and had a good knowledge of the Samsung S22 pen).  Then we went down to the Gong bar where we had a fantastic time.  The food was lovely, we had the meat bento box, chicken Satay skewers and the truffle fries it was delicious.  The atmosphere was great and the staff were very friendly.  A big shout out to Mo Mo our waiter who made us feel very welcome and went above and beyond to Make our visit special.

Yasmin L‚Äôaimable and her events team went above and beyond to make sure everything ran smoothly. Yasmin is a real credit to the Shangri-la and nothing was ever a problem. Amazing service from start to finish and we're so truly grateful.   The proposal was everything I had hoped for and so much more. The company I used to help decorate the room was called 'The proposers' who were equally amazing.   After the proposal in the YI room, we stayed the night. It was the perfect start to our engagement celebrations and the rooms are stunning. We had a beautiful room overlooking Tower Bridge and the views are unreal. The staff are all very friendly and kind and the service is outstanding.  ‚Ä¶"

March 2022,Fantastic View,"What a hotel from the moment we arrived it is all about the service, which was outstanding throughout our stay. As you would expect the Hotel is clean and tidy. We went for a City View Room and this did not disappoint, the views over London both night and day were amazing. We used the infinity pool which was nice and relaxing as they were restricting guests and you needed a time slot to use this facility. 10/10 for location, service, and views."
March 2022,Anniversary stay,"Beautiful Hotel, staff were amazing so helpful, friendly and very accommodating. Made our stay even more special. Definitely recommend and will go again.

February 2022,Excellent belated honeymoon,"We were visiting on a belated honeymoon and had a very nice stay. The service was excellent throughout - particularly from Romy who welcomed us and Marta on our departure - while we also particularly enjoyed using the amazing pool and also the breakfast buffet.   Our three course set menu dinner at Ting was good (although the vegetarian spring rolls were a bit bland) and fair value.   The only slight letdown was the cocktail bar Gong, which was overpriced and not up there with some of London‚Äôs top bars.   Overall an excellent stay and obviously the views throughout the building are epic!"
March 2022,A beautiful stay with family. Superb service.,"Treasuring family!  A beautiful, relaxing stay at Shangri-La at the Shard. We took time out to catch up as a family, away from all the daily distractions.  The service was superb and we felt very well looked after. Staff in Ting, Gong, the pool and at reception went out of the way to make sure they preempted our needs and made our stay extra special.  In particular Marta and Kimberley, who checked us in and out on the front desk, made sure we had the best rooms with fabulous views! They helped us with various enquiries about future stays too. We travel quite a bit and it‚Äôs this level of service that is a key part of the deciding factors, in terms of which properties we choose to return to.  We‚Äôll definitely be back and next time, with more of the family! Thank you!"
March 2022,Jimmy the doorman is AMAZING,"Fabulous experience at the Shard, the onsite team is truly dedicated to guest experience.

March 2022,Amazing room but some improvements needed,"The room, bathroom and views at this hotel are undisputedly stunning and location to London Bridge station is extremely convenient.  However as this hotel charged over ¬£800 per night during our stay, there are definitely areas for improvement:  -Housekeeping times in the evening after 8pm for turn down service or whatever service is too late and inappropriate.  Once I was in the bath and forgot to put on the do not disturb sign, the staff rang twice and proceeded to enter the room.   This was very inappropriate and intrusive at night. Not to mention during Covid times, non-essential entry into rooms should be kept to a minimum unless necessary and turn down service is definitely unnecessary.  This happened 2-3 times during the 3 nights we stayed and was a disturbance.  There‚Ä¶"
March 2022,Lovely lunch!!,"I‚Äôve always liked Thai food, this didn‚Äôt disappoint. I had the Cornish Plaice and my guest had chicken with ginger, chilli and rice, plus a gin and tonic each. Great food and views, helpful staff, had a lovely time üòäüëç"

March 2022,An unforgettable stay,"We had an absolutely amazing weekend break at the Shangri-La The Shard which we are so glad we had the chance to stay in!   From the moment you book to leaving with your suitcases at the very end, nothing is too much trouble for the team and this really makes the experience feel special. We were luckily upgraded to a room with a bath view which was such a nice touch. The room itself is spacious, well-equipped and very comfortable with ample storage space, areas to relax and work (if needs be) and quality amenities such as toiletries, tea and coffee. All of this, you do expect for the cost per night but it is appreciated. The in-room suite pad/tablet is very helpful for any questions surrounding the hotel facilities and the area itself.

Being vegetarian I find meals can be a hit or a miss but I had the black bean tofu and it was honestly one of the best meals I've had. My husband had the Malaysian Rice which he also enjoyed. Sabrina attended to our every need, it is also my birthday weekend so my dessert came with a happy birthday message as did chocolates at the end of our meal, I felt like they made a fuss of us which made the evening even more special. Nathaniel was our sommelier and made sure our glass was never empty and was extremely attentive. I definitely recommend Ting if you are staying in the Shard or visiting London, the views are amazing, the food delicious, the service fantastic and the views to die for."

February 2022,Free-Flowing Champagne brunch,"This was amazing!! Staff and food/drink was amazing and experience as a whole was great. There is a 12.5% service charge to pay when there but the service was perfect so.. I bought this as a surprise for my partner‚Äôs birthday via virgin experience, paid to upgrade to free-flowing champagne and have all confirmation emails. Clearly they didn‚Äôt upgrade the voucher details as the hotel said they were only valid for the other option of the experience (not free-flowing), even after the waiters speaking with Virgin direct to try and resolve. We ended up paying the difference (over ¬£150) + the service charge. I‚Äôd say to book this direct with the hotel, as Virgin are a nightmare and unresponsive."
February 2022,thanks Marj,"We went to have some cocktails at Gong Shangri-La. The staff is super kind! Even though we were running quite late, we were able to stay the full 1h30mins.

We had breakfast in our room after a swim in the breathtaking infinity pool and couldn't believe the quality. An amazing way to start the day!

All the luxurious touches in the room, the Shangri-La bed and the bath with a view to name a few were extremely special to us.   The experience of the Skypool and sauna with a coffee was the perfect opportunity to unwind and made us feel so relaxed, and the staff at the Skypool and sauna waiting to hand you‚Ä¶"

All guests have to visit the pool. It‚Äôs a one of a kind experience!!! And the lady working at the pool makes you feel like a VIP guest!  We spent the evening in TING. Being welcomed by Rosita and given a beautiful table. The lovely Ketiola looking after us and Kat giving us the best wine recommendation (We still dream about the dessert wines).

All the staff were friendly , attentive and very professional - loved being handed a towel when getting out the pool, the night turn down service was very much appreciated, midnight requests to the concierge for drink bookings, beautiful breakfast seating and welcome champagne.

January 2022,"Fabulous views (except the view of other people‚Äôs bathrooms) but food, drink and service don‚Äôt live up to expectations","The one thing that makes this hotel fabulous is the views. The angles of vision of the London skyline are unrivalled and stunning- but aside from that, it‚Äôs decidedly mediocre.  There‚Äôs nothing that‚Äôs truly terribly, but rather lots of things that aren‚Äôt ‚Äòright‚Äô for a 5 star hotel, and these really do ruin the overall experience.  The reception area is quite chaotic as it has guests checking into the hotel plus non-residents going to the Sky Lounge or Ting restaurant. Not to mention lots of quite bizarre green mannequins wearing only salopettes!   Someone was pouring small ‚ÄòWelcome‚Äô peach Bellinis but during the time we were there checking in (and weren‚Äôt actually offered one) the table had more empty, dirty glasses than full ones to take.  Check in took 20 minutes - not‚Ä¶"

December 2021,"Ren Room - Shangri-La The Shard, London","I have been to the Chinese restaurant a few times but most recently, on December 4th, 2021 was for our Christmas Lunch organised by SUKA (Singapore UK Association) @ Ren Room with their signature chandeliers and a grandiose view overlooking the London Bridge and surrounding areas.  The staff was very courteous and helpful from the doorman to the cloakroom and service staff.  What was very good to note was that all diners had to show proof of negative results of lateral flow tests.  In spite of his busy schedule, the General Manager, Mr. Kurt Macher, took time to address our party.  The table decorations were beautiful, with scrumptious food, desserts, and drinks served by friendly staff.  All in all, a beautiful lunch and an experience shared by a party of over 80.

Our room was impeccable, with the most incredible view of London I have ever seen. Beds were perfect, incredibly comfortable and the perfect place for laying and just watching the world below. The bath was so amazing I had 3 in one night! My husband and I were blown away by the attention to detail and the way Kurt the general manager and his staff went above and beyond to make us feel special. I think the best thing about the hotel (despite the obvious views etc) is that such a high end hotel in such a serious looking building once you walk through the doors it feels so welcoming, comfortable and relaxing, a huge difference to some of the other London hotels of the same standard  which can‚Ä¶"

Thanks to Sabrina's suggestion, we also managed to try their winter tea which was heavenly. The service was awesome, and everyone was very warm and welcoming especially Jordeen, Masaki, and Ismail.

December 2021,"Awesome view, amazing service!","We went to Ting to celebrate our friends birthday. Everyone we have encountered greeted us warmly and we can tell that behind their masks, they were smiling too. The environment looked busy but it doesnt affect the way they attended to us.

November 2021,Worst Customer Service Known to Man,Absolutely disgraceful customer service. Made an error on a booking and was told there was nothing that could be done about it and that the booking was non refundable. Was told three times they would call me to discuss the situation and never had one call returned. Due to this I will never stay at this hotel when your spending ¬£900 a night you would expect to be treated a little better. Clearly profit over loyalty is how this group role.

Breakfast in the Ting restaurant was great, as was the meal we ate there in the evening. We enjoyed a couple of visits to the infinity pool and sauna on the 52nd floor, again with great views across the city - especially at sunset.

Welcome from staff was genuinely warm and we were directed to the 35th floor. Another good welcome from a gentleman (cannot remember his name) but he suggested we do the check-in process and once our room was ready they would call us.   At checkin with Joshua (who was very professional and good humoured) we were given a sheet with information about the pool, bar etc.  We received a call within 30 minutes to advise our room was ready. A deluxe city view - which was amazing.   The room was spacious, well laid out. Whilst we weren‚Äôt in the room to watch TV many of the channels had no signal. The iPad with all of the room details also wasn‚Äôt working properly.    The bathroom had shower, bath, heated flooring and very hot toilet seat. Good‚Ä¶"
November 2021,Drink with a view & the kids,"Had a wonderful time at Gong. Me, my husband and our children 9 and 11 arrived at the entrance of the Shard and was quickly temp checked and shown to the lifts up to Gong. A lovely guy came in the lift with us as he was taking someone‚Äôs suitcases up to level 35, he made us feel welcomed and chatted to us, putting my sons mind at rest as he was worried about being so high up. He then showed us to the next lift that took you up to Gong on level 52. We were greeted by a lady that took us to our table. The view was amazing. A friendly man took our order of drinks and kindly made the children a mocktail each. He made us feel very relaxed as I was previously concerned it wasn‚Äôt the place for children but actually they went out of their way to make us feel welcomed. This all added to‚Ä¶"

November 2021,Amazing Hotel. Its not just about the views ! ,The Shangri-la at The Shard is a beautiful hotel that sets new standards for modern understated luxury. Located high up in the Shard all rooms have great views both by day and night. Staff are really understanding of the customer needs and requirements in every area of operations at the hotel. The bedrooms are so light and bright and very well equipped. It's the kind of Hotel that gets you out of the shower and into the tub again ! Dining and bar  facilities exceeded expectations. All of this comes at a price of course and I suspect alot of accounts are settled with Corporate money. However it is also a Hotel that is  just wonderful for the individual traveller. Located in the City but West End attractions and restaurants are easily reached by taxi or public transport. 
November 2021,Fabulous hotel,"Have stayed a couple of times at the Shangri-La an it never fails to impress.  A beautiful hotel with magnificent views, lovely friendly, professional staff and a wonderful infinity pool on the 52nd floor.

November 2021,Unforgettable experience! Can't wait to come back!,"Where do I even start?! From the moment we walked in it was nothing short of magical. We arrived to a stunning sunset with live music in the background and the most friendly yet professional welcome by the reception team. We were checked in by Kimberley, and greeted by the Duty Manager Johan. Both are a credit to the hotel. When we got to the room we were overwhelmed by the views (of course), but also by the many little touches that have been arranged as a surprise for our stay. In the evening we visited GONG for some fantastic cocktails and great atmosphere, followed by an unforgettable dinner in TING. The table, the team, the food and the wine,...everything was perfect!! In the morning we once again visited TING for breakfast and no wish was left unfulfilled! Finally, as we‚Ä¶"

November 2021,Outstanding service!,I never write these reviews although my stay in the Shangri-La- was such a stand out that it deserved to be the exception. From the booking experience through to checking out procedure the service was phenomenal. We were personally looked after by Josh who was one of the most considerate and professional front of house team that I have ever come across in 20 years of travel. His attention to our stay alone will cement our return to the property. If you get the chance to experience the London suite - you will have a bath like no other!
November 2021,Iconic hotel with amazing views,"The hotel itself is just amazing - superb, large and luxurious rooms with stunning views over London. We had a suite with a bath overlooking London - photo opportunities galore! The bed was super-comfy and the bathroom was large and luxurious. The Gong bar was an expensive experience - but I suppose I should have expected that - it‚Äôs the highest bar in Western Europe and is almost bound to carry a premium. It‚Äôs a bit further away from central London than I‚Äôd thought so we had quite a taxi bill by the end of the stay. Breakfast in the room, looking out over London, was a treat and thoroughly enjoyable. I‚Äôve wanted to stay at this hotel for a while and it‚Äôs easy to see why it‚Äôs fully booked so far in advance. During our stay there were a few issues related to points of detail but‚Ä¶"

November 2021,Special Birthday treat for my wife,"I wanted to do something special for my wifes significant birthday, the room we had was amazing, Id paid extra for a room with a good view and it was certainly brilliant. The one thing I found dissapointing was the food in the Ting restaurant, the size of the portions was very small and it was very expensive for what it was and Ive had better quality food. The number of teas and coffees available in the room was insufficient just 4, we asked for some more and we had to leave the room whilst the room service remade the room but all we wanted was a couple more so we were left standing outside our room whilst they attended to it. If the food was better we would have rated the experience much higher, its a five star room and view but three star food. The views though were‚Ä¶"

November 2021,Luxury at its best,"We booked two nights at the Shangri-La hoping for some relaxation after a busy time at home. We were not disappointed. We had a Deluxe City View room with a view towards the east and overlooking the Tower of London. We loved the moment of theatre when you enter your room and the blinds roll up and suddenly London is glittering before you. It was a delight to just sit in the very comfortable armchairs and looks at all the boats on the Thames far below. We also happened to be there on the 5th November and I delighted in sitting in my bath and watching all the fireworks displays taking place in London. However, my most memorable moment was waking up to a spectacular sunrise.   The rooms are very well appointed and extremely comfortable. We ate breakfast in the Ting restaurant which‚Ä¶"

November 2021,One to avoid.,"Amazing rooms, but that's the only positive as the customer experience is simply poor.  We arrived at the hotel, and the staff were professional and friendly, so a big tick.  The room was clean, and with a great view, so that's another big tick.  But that is as good as it gets. Let me explain.  We had 10 couples staying at the hotel, as a thankyou to our team and we booked private dining in the evening.  So why is the service poor, well put simply we arrived at the hotel and tried and arranged to meet early at one of the hotels bars for drinks. Unfortunately, irrespective of you been a guest at the hotel, you need to book a table at the bar.  Unfortunately as no-one had advised us of this, we couldn't get into any of the bars. How can resident not get a casual drink in hotel. ‚Ä¶"
November 2021,I love it.,"Best service from Mattia, Panos and Madalina, i was here in London for the first time and  was everything special. Best place in London, if you are around you mast visit this beautiful bar. Defnetely coming back in one day ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥"
November 2021,"Special, v romantic dinner at Tings.",Fantastic views which was what we expected. First time here though and wasn't setting any expectations on the food or service. Both turned out to be superb. Michael made some great recommendations as we tried to navigate the menu in the end we had a mix of the a all carte and the Shangri-la experience. Pigeon starter was Our standout and the shanghai noodles mains a close second. And we had great service from Nathaniel as well with our wine and additional photography skills and direction. Brilliant evening all round and would definitely recommend.

November 2021,October stay in Shangrila The Shard.,"October stay at the Shangrila Shard  My whole experience in October was amazing but one night is never enough. I didn‚Äôt have a chance to experience 52nd floor. From  check in to check out, I can‚Äôt find any fault. Our fault to not extend for another day. We requested to have an early check in and I had the room before our lunch reservation at Ting. Perfect timing. The concierge and front desk are very helpful, they even offered us an umbrella to use when we went out for shopping.   In Ting restaurant, we sat by the window even it‚Äôs busy. Kat, the sommelier, told us information about the champagne we were drinking, which we never experience in any restaurant or any hotel. All waiters and hostess are amazing and friendly, Checking and making sure our champagne are filled up. Will‚Ä¶"

Marta is very personable and professional, and she was always quick to respond to our many questions, whether it be over email or phone. We also got to meet her a few times during the lead up to the big day, which was extremely helpful as apart from assisting with planning the event, it helped us to get to know her and the venue better.

We decided to celebrate our wedding anniversary by spending a night at the Shard with our 5 year old daughter. Not only does the hotel offer breath taking views of London the attention to detail is outstanding. Everything was thought of to make our stay extra special, from an incredible room, a personal welcome note on the window and a sprinkle of thoughtful in room amenities and gifts for us all. Pre arrival the staff helpt anticipate our needs and suggested pre booking the pool and restaurant to ensure we would be able to enjoy it. I was a little nervous at first as I am not good with heights but that was quickly forgotten as soon as I got into the pool. I am still day dreaming of‚Ä¶"

October 2021,Room only,Paid a significant amount of money to be told that we can only access the swimming pool at 8am and there was no acc√®s to the h√¥tel bar because all the tables are booked for the night. So what you get for a luxury hotel is a room only. All be it a room with a view. Nothing else.  A h√¥tel where they put their guests second. At this money you could stay anywhere else in London. I will next time

We were met in the lift by a lady who happened to check us in, we had mentioned we were staying as an early anniversary treat and when we got the room they had already got a cake up there for us to celebrate! The rooms are very luxurious and roomy and the bed, well you could just stay in it forever it was sooo comfy. I love all the little perks like the tv in the bathroom mirror and the Nespresso machine but the real highlight of the room was the breakfast in the room with the views over London, just spectacular and that same view is just as good if not better at night with all the lights twinkling.  The restaurants are all of an incredibly high standard for breakfast afternoon tea and dinner. The‚Ä¶"

As an example of the great service, a child in our group began crying while we were at the front desk.  Kimberley, the front office supervisor, came to the rescue.  She brought some cupcakes, offered some reassuring words, and found a way to stop the tears.  Service was just so proactive and attentive throughout our stay.  All of us were so impressed."
October 2021,Perfect nights stay with 5* treatment,"We re booked the ‚ÄúPremier City View Room‚Äù as a late birthday stay as last years stay was cancelled due to covid.   From entering the hotels grounds we were greeted with the car valet attendants who were very polite and welcomed us to the hotel. The car valet parking is ¬£55 for 24 hours which I don‚Äôt think is unreasonable considering you‚Äôre in London. We left the car with them and went up to the reception,on this occasion we had checked in though the app so the only thing to do was to collect the room key from the reception which made getting to the room a lot quicker. All staff wearing face masks as well with a guest temperature check on arrival.  The room itself was perfect,bottled water,mini fridge,tea and coffee making facilities,bath robes,slippers ect.

October 2021,Disappointed,"Stayed in iconic view room for 2 nights with husband to celebrate my birthday.  The best thing was the views from the room. I wanted a bathtub by the window and was surprised this cost an extra ¬£100 a night. We have stayed in many 5 star hotels and felt this fell short on service and food. Afternoon tea was not worth the money. Paltry selection of food compared to such places as The Gleneagles Hotel. Breakfast was terrible. Buffet was very poor selection and disappointed to see guests were not wearing masks and breathing all over  the food. We are not long back from a luxury cruise and a 5 star hotel in Greece.  Both these had buffets bit everyone wore masks and not allowed to serve themselves, wait staff helped you to the food which was much more appropriate in these times. If‚Ä¶"
October 2021,The best surprise,"Wow is an understatement for this amazing hotel! Suprise trip for our 13 year anniversary. All the secret chat between my partner and Josh who works on the reception at the hotel.  To then find out we had a room upgrade to then also be surprised when returning to the room that there was rose petals and candles everywhere and a proposal was happening.  Josh went out of his way to make this magical moment happen what a credit to the hotel he is. So helpful and friendly for making this once in a lifetime trip happen.  Thankyou again Josh and to all the other staff to friendly , helpful and welcoming.  Will definitely be returning!"
October 2021,Outstanding service!,"I joined my sister on a work trip to this incredible hotel. From the moment you enter the building the impeccable service starts. The hotel itself is beautiful, clean, provides quality food, we ate in Ting for breakfast and dinner and an array of cocktails both in Gong - the highest bar on floor 52 with incredible views and in Bar 31 outside the hotel's front door- loved the relaxed vibe here.  The swimming pool also on floor 52 is the infinity pool where photo opportunities must be taken! It certainly bought guests together with each taking photos of each other and the pool staff are happy to oblige too! A lovely atmosphere here! Rooms are floor to ceiling windows of views across London's skyline, you are so high up its like watching a model railway run with matchstick people‚Ä¶"
October 2021,Fab u lous,"This is a really special hotel and a must for a really special occasion.  The view is to die for but in our room 4207, the outer structure of the building, did obscure to sides of the window.  We had a superior standard.  I realize this is the entry level room but for what we paid I think you could have a few more ""treats"" included, i.e a choc on the pillow at night or petals on the bed.  We did have the writing on the window and a box of birthday cake on our arrival.  The staff are lovely and really accommodating.  The room was spotless and I wanted to take the bed home it was that comfortable!   The heated toilet seat is fun too.  A lovely hotel and stay all in all."
October 2021,Amazing overall experience!,"From the very begining the experience and customer service was great! We arrived super early and was seated quickly. We asked to move to a window seat which was granted very quickly, the staff were amazing and friendly which made us feel welcome and comfortable  on the get go. The food presentation was beautiful and the flavours were rich. I am extremely happy that I chose to have my anniversary dinner at the Ting restaurant. Nathaniel, Esmail and Jack served us very well and the food was delicious. Not to forget the cute complimentary fruit and chocolates at the end which was very sweet and thoughtfull. Overall I can say that this was the best experience that I've had at a restaurant."
October 2021,Amazing experience,"Our whole experience here from start to finish was incredible. We were made very comfortable by Esmail and Nathaniel, who provided amazing service and care, moving us into a nice table near the window. I could tell they really appreciated us and made us feel very welcomed and comfortable dining here. They were very patient with us when we were ordering and checking up on us here and there. The cocktails made by Jack were delightful. The food arrived in a timely manner and tasted perfect. After we had finished eating, we were brought out complimentary fruit and chocolates for our anniversary and it was very thoughtful and sweet. We were very thankful and it rounded out our night, making it an unforgettable experience. Overall, I would say this has been one of the best experiences‚Ä¶"

September 2021,What a memorable stay,"Hubby and I have had the privilege to stay in some amazing hotel but this is just just out of this world.  We arrived into London early in the am due to flight changes.  Walked thro the front door and our suitcases were taken care of.  Went up to reception, did not expect to check in but we did.  At least we completed all the paperwork.  The view was simply stunning.  We have been to Oblix and Shard viewing in the past but still, this was simply breathtaking.    We went away with the promise that someone will call us when our room becomes available.  And guess what? at noon.  Just wow.  We walked around the area, had a leisurely lunch and picked up our room key.  We walked into the room, the blinds went up automatically and the view was just simply speechless.  We literally‚Ä¶"
September 2021,If one is bored of London one is bored of life,"Enjoying a pretty spectacular breakfast overlooking London which in itself is pretty spectacular. From the Shangri-La The Shard, the history of the city is laid bare below you. It is thought provoking, humbling & terrifying in equal measure - a snap shot of humanity. But through the centuries.  The staff at the hotel are excellent & we were looked after with quiet & friendly efficiency at breakfast by Isaac & Danny. A superb short stay on the first theatre trip to London since Covid. The Sky Pool at the hotel a must. A very welcome return to normality? Fingers crossed. Just need to get over my vertigo!"

I would like to say a special thank you to Josh who was so kind in arranging a beautiful stay for our daughter‚Äôs second birthday! He even arranged a nice table for our meal in Oblix on our request. The staff, the location, the facilities make it the best place to stay! I would highly recommend this place and will definitely come back again!"

Compliments to the chefs who produced food like I've never had before. Going to London? Go to Ting, you won't regret it."
July 2021,Great hotel with the best possible views of London,"Stayed here for two nights in early September. Great experience on arrival with efficient valet parking and concierge service. On check-in we were upgraded to a room on the 49th floor with spectacular views over the rive towards the Walkie-Talkie and HMS Belfast. The room was well appointed including a Nespresso, binoculars and a fabulous bathroom. I was celebrating my birthday and was surprised by a cake and card which was a lovely touch. Our package also included their 'bath experience' which was divine - honestly the best smelling bath I've ever had! The buffet breakfast was good with a great selection available. The bread options were initially disappointing but I was offered sourdough toast when I asked. In summary, this is a great hotel in a great location with views to‚Ä¶"

August 2021,Outstanding!,"Over two years ago we  stayed here purely for the experience of spending a memorable night at one of London's unique hotels. The Shangri-La Hotel is located in the iconic Shard, that super-tall skyscraper of some 95 floors which towers over London from the south bank of the Thames at London Bridge. The hotel occupies floors 35 to 52 of the Shard, with the main Reception on the 35th floor.  Our stay then  was, without a doubt, exceptional.  That‚Äôs why we chose the Shangri-La at the Shard again, to celebrate a milestone birthday, seeing that a trip abroad to somewhere fabulous was virtually out of the question due to the COVID situation.  We wanted a room with a city view and one that offered the ‚Äòbath with a view‚Äô arrangement.  We‚Äôd selected a room type on the hotel‚Äôs website,‚Ä¶"

A special thanks to Leon, Nathaniel and a female waitress who were all brilliant.  Attentive and friendly and just making my day special.    Nathaniel, you asked me if there was anything you could do to improve the service?  My answer is: 'No there is nothing more that you could have done.""

August 2021,16th Birthday Celebration,"We first visited Shangri-La for the first time to celebrate fathers day in June. We were given good rooms and a bathroom with view. On the very first day we had lunch in one of the restaurants and found a hair in our food. The second day we went for swimming and a big piece of mould similar to the size of a golf ball was that was stuck in the tap of the drinking water dispenser ended up in my cup . We called the person in charge and showed him and he notified his manager who then apologised.  After filling in a survey sent to us after our stay, we received an email from senior management and was reassured that our next experience would be much better and we will be well looked after when we choose to return.   We chose to return to celebrate my son 16th birthday in August. We‚Ä¶"

September 2021,The ultimate Shangri-La Experience.,"When one thinks of Shangri-La The Shard, London, of course one instantly associates it with opulence and glamour, yet it is so much more than that as the staff ensure that it is exceptionally welcoming and has a wonderful homely feel to it.  Despite living in London, we wanted to book something to look forward to that equally didn't involve much of a journey so we thought we'd try this wonderful Hotel.  Eventually it has been a dream that came true. Of course, staying at Shangri-La The Shard, London was a natural choice for my parents‚Äô London staycation.  Upon arrival our cases were whisked away by the charming doorman, and we were very quickly checked-in by a very knowledgeable and professional person called Tyrone. Our stunning room was located on the 40th floor and as you‚Ä¶"
September 2021,Great service and food,"We had a lovely lunch at Ting as part of our honeymoon celebrations. Jenny was very attentive, the view was great and the food fabulous! We have been before but I'd say this occasion was by far the best. Definitely make the most of the lunch deal if available. Great value."
September 2021,The perfect evening,"My fianc√© and I visited for our anniversary, we were looked after by Leon & he took such great care of us. We had the most wonderful evening & we are so grateful to Leon & the team for making us feel so welcome, the food was perfect & the service was excellent."
September 2021,"Great service, great food.",We were served by the ever so charming and attentive Ketiola. She made us feel very relaxed and the service and food was grand. Would definitely return again and recommend it to our family & friends Thankyou Ting and Ketiola :)
September 2021,Ting reataurant in the Shangri la hotel.,"Great experience and time spent in the Ting restaurant at the Shangri la hotel, excellent food and life music make you feel special, staff serving us make the time even better.  Must mention very nice lady name Jing help us from very start with the menu and during our dining always making sure we have everything we need. Top quality service and food  !!!"
September 2021,Afternoon Tea at Ting,"Really enjoyed the afternoon tea experience, great food and amazing views, and brilliant service from Esmail our waiter who was incredibly helpful throughout and very attentive. Next time I would ask for him personally!"
September 2021,Service,I spend the day in this beautiful restaurant and fiona  was magnificent with their service including waiters Leon and Nathaniel whom greeted me and made me felt appreciated and as the skyline light up during the evening which made the scenery exquisite and really set a nice mood for the dinner and the food was delicious and exceeded above expectations. I recommend and do intend to come back :)
September 2021,What a view‚Ä¶,Fabulous Asian food and a view to die for.  This is a beautiful hotel with incredible views of London. Slightly odd that our bottle of water disappeared after night 1 leaving us to buy our own but this was a small gripe.   Ting restaurant is fabulous and Nathaniel was the perfect waiter.   Come to celebrate a special occasion - and ask for a window table!
September 2021,Exceptional service at Ting,"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary dinner at the Shangri-La's Ting restaurant at a table with stunning views overlooking Tower Bridge and Canary Wharf in the distance.  The menu selection at Ting is a great combination of East meets West with a number of unique dishes. While everything was absolutely spot on, what we appreciated the most was the level of service. Both Leon and Nathaniel (sommelier), made the experience very memorable through their attentiveness. Its those little touches and quality of service that made our anniversary dinner all the more special.  We look forward to returning to the Shangri-La very soon."
August 2021,Amazing experience,"What an amazing experience, Emilio was incredible, attentive service made my wife's birthday super special Many thanks the Shard , keep up.the great work never fails to impress and we will be back again soon"
September 2021,Dinner @Ting another 5* evening,"I‚Äôve had the pleasure to visit Ting many times and it never disappoints. Modern Asian splendidly curated with a premium service experience courtesy of Spiros and his hard working kitchen and floor team. Formal dining meets an informal, warm and friendly setting. Wonderfully served wine by Piotr (and his new sommelier who‚Äôs name escapes me) as always. Emilio was our server last night and did an amazing job. Brought a real personality to the evening! I was ambitious with my dinner order (for 2) but we cleared the plates. Thank you Franziska for organising. Recommend."
August 2021,Birthday Celebration for the Wife,"My wife's first birthday celebration in London and I couldn't ask for a better venue. We booked a lunch menu and although I made a mistake with the booking, I called them at 7am in the morning to confirm and they were more than happy to help.  On arrival they were able to offer us the halal hainanese chicken and rice even though it was not available on the menu. Coming from a Malay background the chicken & rice and Cha Been Hoon was spot on.   Our waitress Jenny was so friendly and helpful and although all staff were wearing masks, you could tell they always greeted us with a smile.  Just to top it off, the view of London and the live music just completed the ambience of the celebration. Thank you Ting Shangri-la"
September 2021,ShangriLaLondon,Excellent hotel. Breath taking views. Good customer service. Quality food with a good in room dining experience facilitated by Alfaad Bepari. Strongly recommend this fine hotel in the heart of London City Centre.
September 2021,Great romantic evening,Visited Ting for a birthday celebration with my partner and were served by Leon. He was very attentive and a delight to have as our waiter. Nothing was too much for him and he was happy to help us make decisions on food based on what we said we liked.
September 2021,Anniversary night,"Stayed overnight for our 10th wedding anniversary. Lovely surprise of complimentary bottle of champagne and cake in the room. Also had dinner in Ting restaurant. Our waitress Ketiola was warm, welcoming and attentive. Nice touch at the end with Happy Anniversary chocolate plaques on our deserts."
September 2020,Superb,"We spent two nights here to celebrate our wedding anniversary and loved every second of our stay.  We received the warmest welcome from Tyrone at check-in, and were delighted when he told us that we were being given a room on the highest floor and that our breakfast would be included.  He also booked the pool for us, and made our breakfast reservation.  Our room on the 50th floor was incredible.  There was so much space, we looked out over Tower Bridge on one side, and everything we could have wished for was there, from a shoe horn to a pair of binoculars, as well as all the toiletries, robes and slippers.  One minor annoyance was that we could see into our neighbour's bathroom, which meant they could see into our room as well, but the blinds did their job.    We used the pool‚Ä¶"
August 2021,London High Life,"You take a bit of a risk when you book a hotel to celebrate a special occasion. So I‚Äôm very happy to review the Shanghai-La London as excellent on every level. Literally.  From dropping off our bags earlier than check in to regrettably having to depart to go home every member of the hotel staff was courteous, helpful and interested in us and why we were staying there.  We upgraded to a Premier City View room before arrival and it was the best decision. The views from our room were utterly mesmerising and we couldn‚Äôt stop looking at the city day and night. Some London hotels you‚Äôre pleased to only sleep in but this hotel was one where you just can‚Äôt wait to get back to look out of those windows again.  This trip was everything we hoped for and so much more. Thank you to everyone‚Ä¶"
September 2021,Great views and comfy rooms,"This is a splurge but its worth it, especially after lockdown through a pandemic. Our room was huge, with floor to ceiling windows on the 45th floor. Super comfy room, with an incredible view. The bathroom, especially the toilet is amazing. Food is good, service is above and beyond. You never want to leave the room ! Emily checked us in and she's the absolute best. Super helpful and had great suggestions !"

The staff were fantastic, they made us feel like we were the only ones they were serving, that we were special.  We had an amazing view which our waiter knew exactly how to capture on our phones. The staff are completely professionally and impeccable in their hosting and delivery skills. Henry Bernal helped to arrange this amazing experience."
September 2021,Wonderful birthday at Shangri-la,"Spent the day at Shangri-la for my birthday. 5* service from begining to end. Amazing dishes, fabulous views and wonderful service from Jing, Simone and Nathaniel. Highly recommended and will definitely be back."
September 2021,"A perfect, five star experience","Our stay was everything we visualised and more, from start to finish.  The decor and interior at reception is second to none, and the staff are exceptionally helpful and friendly.   We were on the 43rd floor and it goes without saying the views were breathtaking. Our room was fantastic, and we loved every minute spent in it. The entire place was completely spotless top to bottom.   Dinner at Ting was fantastic, it felt really special and didn‚Äôt want it to end.   Before dinner we also had a cocktail at Gong bar on the top floor which had such a brilliant vibe. Could have spent much longer in there easily!   Breakfast was the highlight for us. Thankfully the buffet was open as normal, and I loved creating ‚Äòa little bit of everything‚Äô on my plate. Everything tasted fresh, pure and‚Ä¶"
September 2021,Rooms in the clouds,"Was expecting a whole lot more but can‚Äôt put my finger on what‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Hotel staff were all super attentive and engaging, view was beautiful from morning to night and plenty to watch as we enjoyed the bars and restaurants of Gong & Ting. Luckily we booked ahead of arrival as concierge confirmed on arrival that they had no capacity."
September 2021,Amazing Ting,"Had such an amazing experience thanks to Emilio, such a kind welcoming gentleman and smiley, and the food was amazing:)   Will deffo be coming back again in the future and maybe have more room for dessert"

Jimmy is very attentive and always had our cars ready upon arrival and cleared the pathways so we could exit and arrive safely , extremely friendly and professional and above all loves dogs . Hopefully next time we go back to stay Jimmy is on duty so he can be the one to greet us . A great person and makes the London experience much more pleasant. Thank you for everything.

August 2021,Amazing service,An amazing experience. The view is amazing. Food is exceptional. The service was excellent. Thank you to Jenny for a fantastic service. What a lovely person. Made our experience even better. Will return and hope to have Jenny serve us again. Thank you
August 2021,Amazing views,"We stayed at the hotel for our mini moon and had a brilliant stay! We stayed in a premier city room with views over Tower Bridge, the Tower of London and HMS Belfast. The room was very spacious, clean and comfortable.  We had a slight issue with our luggage making it‚Äôs way to our room which was eventually rectified and the staff provided us with a bottle of champagne to apologise for the error.   We ordered room service late one evening and although very expensive it was delicious!   Breakfast was tasty and the views from the Ting restaurant were fab.   The staff were very attentive and made us feel well looked after. We‚Äôd definitely recommend this hotel to anyone celebrating a special occasion."
August 2021,25th Wedding Anniversary trip,Amazing stay for our 25th Wedding Anniversary. Berta was excellent and ensured that our stay was made very memorable by her customer focus and care. Masaki and Nathaniel were excellent in the Ting bar and looked after us very well. One of the best hotels we have stayed at we will definitely return. Outstanding service üëç
August 2021,Not great value for money,"Our party of 8 stayed at the Shangri La for one night in August. Reception staff were very good, efficient and professional, our room was not ready but we could leave our bags with them and explore the city until our room was ready. The hotel phoned me to advise the room was ready which I felt was a nice touch. Our bags had been delivered to our rooms when we went into them. The rooms themselves although well appointed were disappointing for the amount we had paid for a nights stay, we felt they were practical rather than luxurious.  We paid for a 180 degree view from our room, this was a nice extra but not sure if it was worth the ¬£150 upgrade. Our room rate included breakfast at the hotel. This unfortunately was a disappointment.  We were shown to the table and offered tea‚Ä¶"
August 2021,Superb service and attention to detail,"My friend and I stayed here for her birthday and retirement. Staff went out of their way to fit us in for afternoon tea. Afternoon tea was so impressive at the Ting restaurant, with the most spectacular views ever.   Breakfast was superb, as you would expect, and staff gave my friend a celebratory cake. Our room overlooked the London Eye and St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral.   Attention to detail was outstanding, and the hotel was beautifully decorated.  "
August 2021,Beautiful experience,"Beautiful surroundings, great service, and delicious food. Also wonderful views. We enjoyed our lunch at ShangriLa. The set menu choices were limited but the flavours were exquisite. Would define recommend as a special event - expensive but worth it."
August 2021,Birthday meal,"Leon and Nathaniel were truly the quality Shangri-la deserves, both were fantastic in their roles, knowledgeable, helpful, attentive and overall gave us a dining experience to remember, thank you so much, we will be back!  Connor & Laura"
August 2021,Fabulous - what a way to mark an occasion!,We dined at Ting to mark a special birthday and from the moment we stepped foot on the 35th floor to the moment we left it was magical! The views were spectacular of course and the food was divine (we chose Shangri-La specialties) and the service and hospitality was second to none. Very special. Thank you!
August 2021,Dinner at the Shangri-La hotel,"I had an absolutely amazing time dining at the Ting restaurant, and more importantly because I was served by Nathaniel. Nathaniel is a star, he made our stay worth it. Thumbs up Nath! Keep up the good service"
August 2021,Fantastic food and wine to match,My partner and I came for our anniversary. The hotel stay was simply magical. Cocktails in Gong were fab followed by a delicious 2 course meal in Ting. We were very well looked after by Simone and Nathaniel- thanks so much all!
August 2021,Fabulous view and beautifully prepared dining.,Beautiful Asian restaurant with British menu options that has outstanding views of London from the 35th floor of the Shard. Great place for a special dinner. Service was excellent and Leon was terrific. He has a wonderful sense of humor and is delightfully hospitable.
August 2021,Meal at ting,"Emilo was our server and he was absolutely amazing, he was unbelievably catering to our dietary restrictions and made us feel so welcome. The food was sublime and Emilo  was so helpful in helping us chose the best dishes for us to try. Can‚Äôt recommend enough!!!"
August 2021,Perfect few days ,"Myself and my husband have just spent 2 fabulous nights here for my birthday. All of the staff are very helpful and friendly. We upgraded our room to a bath with a city view on the second night which was incredible.   The guys out front looking after the valet parking are also great! So easy to use.   Ting restaurant, gong bar are amazing and an early swim in the sky pool is a must!  We can't wait to come back. "
August 2021,Shanghai Restaurant - Ting,"Fantastic 5 course taster meal with brilliant service from Evmail and Nathaniel. Truly an excellent experience of fine dining tastes, flavours and complementary wines. Really enjoyed it, and of course the great ariel views from the 35th floor of the Shard."
August 2021,Just fantastic,What a fabulous evening.  Nathaniel our fantastic wine expert that     made our 5 course experience superb. Along with Eumail our  lovely server. The whole experience at the Shard has been breath taking. This special day was booked as a surprise by my daughter as a 60th birthday treat for me and she said she could not fault the help of the staff that made the special day for us and her all via email. Thank to very one at the Shard. X
August 2021,A Very Special Experience,"This was our 20th Wedding Anniversary and we certainly wanted a very special evening.  It was perfect!  Fantastic food, drink, ambiance and wonderful service from the staff, showing kindness throughout the night.  Add the sensational views of London to the mix!! Highly recommended!"
July 2021,Breath-taking views and delicious tea,"We had the afternoon tea, vegan selection. Amazing views, and though it was quite busy, Jenny was an amazing waitress that did her best! Would definitely recommend, expensive but worth the experience, and the food was delicious!"
August 2021,Stay at the shard,Great stay and great staff.  Myself wife and 8 year old daughter stayed at the shard recently. Great staff and a special mention to Jimmy the door man great service nothing too much trouble and a great asset. Also would like to mention Jing again great customer service. Would highly recommend staying here and also eating here. My daughter is already wanting to go back.
August 2021,Evening made special at Ting by Sabrina - thank you,I was hosted by a lady called Sabrina she was absolutely professional friendly and amazing with my 4 year old daughter she made us comfortable and represented the hotel/restaurant in a very positive and professional way  Sabrina did a walk through the menu and explained everything taking care of allergies and requirements and took care of any special needs. I wasn't so impressed with the food at ting the portions were very small I blame the chef and restaurant for misleading menu.
August 2021,High prices but you pay for the view,"We stayed for two nights for a family staycation in London. The hotel is a perfect spot for doing so, well located for all tourist attractions. The rooms were bright and spacious and obviously everyone comes for the views. Our arrival was a little disappointing as the hotel felt a bit like a crowded train station with long lines and delayed check-in. But after that things got better and the hotel soon became calmer, and our stay was very pleasant. The food and drinks are extremely expensive and I guess you pay for the view. If you‚Äôre looking for a place to place yourself in London and prices are not off putting then we would highly recommend"
August 2021,best afternoon tea in London!,the place was incredible and food was fantastic! Great friendly staff too! 5 star all over! I have to say its been an incredible  experience visiting this place and me and my friends enjoy the afternoon with the impeccable view! I recommend this to everyone who would visit London!
August 2021,"Excellent Stay, all about those views","We stayed at The Shangri La for night 1 of a weekend break in London and was very impressed by the building and service. The room was nice, 50th floor so a little more expensive than others. Service was good, the Spa and Sauna was excellent (best view ever from inside a Sauna). The breakfast was okay but its all about the view here. I do not want to be too hard on the hotel as there is nothing wrong with it however, for the cost, there are better value hotels or hotels with a much higher class of service depending on what you are looking for. Day 2 we stayed at The Corinthia and this was head and shoulders above the Shangri La. However I would recommend but not in a rush to return."
July 2021,Ting Restaurant,"We celebrated our 1 year wedding anniversary at the Ting restaurant and had the most wonderful time. The staff were so welcoming and friendly, made the evening very special. A huge thank you to simone and Nathaniel who waited on us and made out night fab. Thank you üòä"
August 2021,Shangri La Hotel,"I visited with my family to the GONG bar and it was a truly sensational experience, one that I look forward to again. I would like to especially thank Erangelos for his amazing care and looking after us!"
August 2021,Birthday lunch and drinks,My wife treated me to a birthday lunch at Ting restaurant. Brilliant 360 degree views of the capital. The Shard is a lovely experience and the 3 course lunch at the Ting restaurant was amazing. Thank you to Jing and Nathaniel for making our day an amazing experience   would 100% recommend a visit to this lovely restaurant. A great experience which we won't hesitate coming back again soon.
August 2021,Given up on service,"We have stayed at this hotel every year for our wedding anniversary since it opened including during August 2020 just after the first wave of the pandemic when the service was exemplary as ever.  Not this year - we had a catalogue of errors, mostly blamed on Covid restrictions.  I don‚Äôt understand how a hotel which could get it so right in 2020 when the Covid restrictions were greater can get it so wrong a year later and actually just not care.  If you want to experience exceptional service at a similarly priced hotel, then go to the Hotel Cafe Royal.  We went in July 2021 for my birthday so during the pandemic.  We were repeat customers but we won‚Äôt be returning."
August 2021,The holiday of a lifetime,"Took my three girls on a three-day staycation at the Shangri-La in July as we decided to be tourists in London for our annual holiday this year (due to Covid). We had the holiday of a lifetime! We booked a riverside Iconic Suite, had dinner at the Ting Restaurant and lots of dips in the infinity pool. While the hotel itself is amazing, it's the staff that make it super special. Thank you to Sonia and Rita (Silva) for checking us in and out and to Esmail for fantastic service at dinner. And thank you to all the staff who worked between 14 and 16th July, we felt very special and looked after. It was a really memorable holiday and worth every single penny."
August 2021,Beautiful view from the sky pool,"Had a great stay, just a couple of nights. The pool is great and the attendant even better, (Andzelika) . She checks in and helpful, passes towels to you as you get out of the pool, brilliant person. Josh checked us in at the reception, went through all bookings we needed, like sky bar, pool and breakfast. Berta, on guest relations is lovely.  Improvements could be, table service for breakfast, tea service to the table was slow, on the last morning we left without the tea arriving?  Lift up to the reception are often out of order, if both were broken what would you do?"
August 2021,Genuine review,"Booked a superior room for our 25th wedding anniversary- having previously stayed in 5* hotels I would say that the 3* that we have allocated to this hotel is generous. On arrival one lift was out of action, and had to wait 15 minutes to queue and check in not exactly 5* quality! With apology from reception staff.   The reception employee was very pleasant and informative.  However, on entering the room it was quite apparent that the upkeep of our room was not to a 5* standard - some furniture had scratches and the bidet did not work, I called the concierge twice to report the issue as advised by reception should we have any issues, but had no response so I decided to report the issue to reception, after queuing for a further 15 mins, a maintenance engineer was quickly‚Ä¶"

August 2021,JP,"Had an amazing time taking my girlfriend up here. Leon was our server and he was a great host, our advice to him is just to speak a tiny bit louder! (Masks make it hard to hear) The food was delayed a tiny bit, but the view more then made up for the waiting time. We really enjoyed our time here. 5/5"
August 2021,"Great food, unparalleled view and impeccable service from Leon",The boys and I dined at Ting restaurant today. The food was excellent and our waiter Leon was brilliant. The view from the restaurant was breathtaking; we could see the whole of London. Highly recommended!
July 2021,Fantastic Afternoon Tea at Ting,Visited Ting at the Shangri-La today for Cloud Forest Afternoon Tea to celebrate our wedding anniversary.   The service was great and the food was beautiful to look at and to eat.  All staff wished us Happy Anniversary and they even gave us some chocolates as a gift at the end. Would highly recommend.
August 2021,The most helpful staff,"I lost my phone, and gentleman had found it and kindly said he would drop it to the shard after dinner. This phone had precious memories and photos of my children so I was ever so thankful.  Once I arrived at the shard Albert and Bassam  Where the most helpful reception staff. They managed  to locate my phone and even went to the restaurant to collect it for me.   They sat me down and got me a bottle of water as they could see how distressed I was.   I am most grateful for all the kindness I received. From the staff at the Shard and the gentleman who found my phone.  I would like to say a massive thank you"
August 2021,Delightful!,Everything about Ting‚Äôs restaurant is fantastic. The food was astounding and the care and service by Sabrina and Nathaniel were instrumental in us having an enjoyable time. I will come again and urge you to try as well.
July 2021,Birthday Dinner,I really loved the service I received at Ting the Shard. I was served my Nathaniel and Sabrina who both made my experience the most enjoyable. We were seated directly by the London Bridge with the best view and were offered such a lovely service. Nathaniel helped me choose my champagne which was delightful and he was such a Joy to be around. Overall it was a 10/10 experience and I will definitely be visiting regularly.
August 2021,Great hotel - Dinner at Ting was Amazing,"Stayed for one night for a birthday celebration. Outstanding place. Room 5008 has a bath overlooking St Paul‚Äôs, the Thames and Borough Market. Dinner at Ting was amazing. The service was very attentive but not intrusive; such polite, wonderful and welcoming staff. Our waitress Sabrina was very knowledgeable and attentive, the sommelier Nathaniel was incredible too. A great celebration."
July 2021,Miss,Really friendly and considerate staffs!! They are all very helpful and super lovely!! The view from the room is absolutely gorgeous!! Also very close to London bridge and borough market so fantastic location-wise too!! Definitely recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a luxurious and relaxing trip in Londonüëç
August 2021,50th birthday surprise!,A magical time at the Shangri La!  My Fianc√© was 50 and I wanted it to be special and it was. Amazing views and we felt like a Prince and Princess!  The room had magnificent views of London and was spacious. The bathroom was to die for. The swimming pool had restricted entry due to Covid but we did not have to wait either day we stayed and loved it there - very relaxing. Our meal in the TING restaurant was also superb.  The attention from the staff from being in the lift to walking around to reception was outstanding!  Valet parking was an asset.   Mr Kurt Macher should be very proud of his team!  Only one feedback point - could do with more than one USB port in the bedroom.  One word - FABULOUS!
July 2021,The Best Hotel!,"We stayed in the hotel for a week, the whole family agreed this is the best hotel we ever been to! The views are fantastic, very impressed with the service! All the stuff are very friendly and helpful. I want to take this opportunity to say thank you to Jing Nie, the wonderful lady in the Ting restaurant, she really impressed us with her professional customer service and what a lovely lady! Wonderful views and service, good food! Will definitely come back again!"
August 2021,Shangri-la at The Shard,"This visit was a birthday celebration and  was a fabulous 2 day  break. The Shangri-la is a wonderful hotel in a great location, combining elegance, style and exceptional service. Friendly and charming staff throughout the hotel but a special thanks to Josh ( who checked us in) and ionut for their care and attention."
August 2021,Great Meal,"We went to Ting restaurant for lunch, the main course was very tasty and the dessert was delicious.  The environment on the Shard was spectacular, even in the toilets there was a stunning view of the city.   In general all the staff members were very welcoming and friendly.  I will definitely come back in the near future!"
August 2021,Lunch with friends someplace new,"Lunch for five of us at Ting was a treat.  Service, led by Marco, was friendly, professional and truly without fault.  From the time we were seated, we were made to feel welcomed.  Ordered drinks and then, upon looking at the menu, decided to have three courses at ¬£34.50.  Starters were enjoyed all around and mains were very good indeed which included lamb rump, prawn tortellini and glazed pork belly.  While indulgent, desserts were rather light in a really nice way.  Ambiance was great, enhanced by being seated at the windows overlooking the City, the Thames and Canary Wharf.  And during all of this, excellent customer service throughout.  Looking forward to booking afternoon tea in the near future.  Thanks to all the staff who ensured we had a lovely dining experience."
July 2021,Family reunion,"Lovely stay in amazingly situated hotel. Room and facilities excellent. Staff friendly and helpful. Pool staff very good. Valet and concierge service staff were superb and helpful and very interactive. Was particularly impressed with Ionut and Arnole. I did find the check in and reception process very slow and somewhat chaotic partly due to poor signage and lack of space and staff. I had anticipated that  a more interesting and greater choice of non alcoholic drinks would be available, particularly wine. But overall a very good few days which will likely be repeated."
June 2021,An incredible place!!,Had the most amazing time here celebrating our anniversary! The staff could not have been more attentive. We had the perfect views from our seat and witnessed the most beautiful rainbow. I would thoroughly recommend to everyone. Thanks Kurt and the team for an incredible experience.
June 2021,The perfect date night,"An absolutely amazing restaurant and view with staff who go out of their way to make your experience even better. Our waiter, Leon, did just this. We cannot fault the food, the service and the views. We even had an extra surprise with a Happy Birthday decoration on our dessert. We would definitely recommend to visit."
July 2021,Gong Bar,"Daria is the best!! So attentive, Proffesional, perfect product knowledge and customer service. She is a brilliant asset to the company. Love the view, amazing cocktails and atmosphere is just perfect,positive  vibes üòç"
July 2021,Great hospitality and service!,Just wanted to give a big shout out to Leon in particular who served us at the Ting Lounge one evening during our stay at the Shard. He was so attentive and accommodating - which really made our evening! 
July 2021,Stunning family staycation,"We booked 2 rooms on the family staycation package which included breakfast and a room upgrade. Our rooms we fabulous - WHAT A VIEW!!- overlooking Tower Bridge towards the city. AMAZING!! The rooms were set up as requested (king and 2 singles, adjoining). They were beautifully appointed.  We were on floor 36. The rooms were huge. Beds were extremely comfortable. The bathrooms and toiletries were sublime.  The breakfast buffet has so much choice, both British and Asian, that we never used the a-la-carte menu.  The pool had to be pre-booked but we got all the slots we requested. It has a stunning view, but isn‚Äôt huge.  Whilst the rooms and facilities are outstanding what makes the hotel is the staff. They are a real credit to the establishment. So friendly, always addressing you‚Ä¶"
July 2021,The views are the selling point,"It‚Äôs definitely an experience staying in the shard but only for the views. I didn‚Äôt really find anything else that spectacular. We ate at the restaurant both for our evening meal and breakfast. Food isn‚Äôt great and there‚Äôs not much choice. Went for a swim in the pool and my goodness it was freezing!! Again, the only good thing was the views. There are nicer hotels to stay in in London but everyone must go once for the experience"
July 2021,Unforgettable experience,"We visited the Shangri-La the Shard for my 18th birthday, all the staff were very welcoming and friendly. Many thanks to Rita and Tania for surprising me with the decorations and birthday cake. I was also very impressed with the excellent and attentive service provided by Danny and Alina at the Ting restaurant. Thank you so much to all the staff for making the experience so special."
June 2021,Ting Restaurant,"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Ting for a pre-show meal. The food and wine were gorgeous, a shame we couldn't stay for desert as the cheese board looked very tempting! The staff were attentive and our server Leon particularly made our visit special! The views of course were unbelievable, highly recommended !"
July 2021,Shangri la hotel,"I was served by emilio. He was lovely, amazing service. Food was first class. Amazing view. One to visit! The dessert was extremely nice and light. Perfect for after a heavy meal. But the service was top notch."
July 2021,Anniversary dinner,We had the most incredible evening at both Gong and Ting! Marco was amazing and ensured we had such a lovely anniversary with nonstop attentive service and oh my gosh the food was sublime. I would 100% recommend this to anyone for any occasion! W‚Äôere thinking of making our visit to Ting a yearly tradition
June 2021,Wonderful Experience,We can not fault any aspect of our dinner and stay. Everything was as amazing as expected. The dinning in the sky experience was second to none made even better by our waiter Tanveer. And we were made so comfortable throughout our stay from start to finish by Josh on the front desk. We would highly recommend a visit to the Gong Bar with it‚Äôs perfect views and amazing drinks. And the room was absolutely stunning having everything we needed to enjoy our night to the full. Our experience as a whole was outstanding and we would love to return.
July 2021,Wonderful views,"Stayed here one night in June and the hotel is stunning, amazing views, immaculate room, respectful staff, unbelievable food, awesome pool and gym, and the room had everything you would expect from a five star hotel, (well almost). I was told to book for breakfast as there was high demand, which I did. On Saturday night my friend and myself decided to visit the hotel bars and found to our astonishment that we couldn‚Äôt get in, as apparently they were full. Had I been told at the time of booking my room, that I would also have to book a place in the bars, then I would have done so. In the end, I had to find a local off license and have a couple of drinks in our room. I have an iPhone 12, something that I would assume many people staying at the Shard would have, but when it came to‚Ä¶"
July 2021,Trip away with my daughter,"We had a wonderful holiday, all the staff we're very nice and helpful. I felt very relaxed and comfortable in the hotel with my 9 year old daughter who also loved the hotel. Nothing was too much trouble for the conseige and duty manager. I want to give a special mention to Jimmy the doorman who helped me out when I arrived at the hotel in my car to find it very busy and no place to park,( I was also a little stressed because the streets have been changed to a one way system but car sat navigation kept sending me the wrong Wayne!) he ran straight over and guided me to a safe place to leave my car before it could be parked properly. I will definitely be returning."
July 2021,"Mediocrity, only 50 Floors Up.","Since completing my stay I have updated this review‚Ä¶  Like a grown up jingling keys to distract a baby. The Shangri-La seems to want you to look out of the windows at the pretty view so as not to notice that they aren‚Äôt doing a stellar job inside.   This is my second stay at this hotel. The first stay had some small issues and we decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. However, the second has cemented my view that this experience is sub-par.  It isn‚Äôt a single glaring issue - except maybe the lack of attention to detail. But our stay was punctuated by a progressive host of small annoyances that add up to a stay not really up to snuff when compared to other similarly priced hotels.  For many I‚Äôm sure the experience would be ‚Äòok‚Äô. But having stayed in many a fine hotel. The‚Ä¶"
July 2021,Hard to beat,"We stayed two nights in an iconic city view room and one night in a premier city view - well worth going for a room with a north facing city view for the absolutely spectacular views.  We have stayed here several times and if you‚Äôre after a fabulous hotel with a view, it‚Äôs hard to beat. Really excellent service, especially from the front desk team who were exceptionally helpful. Good breakfast - not my favourite ever hotel breakfast, it could do with better bread but there are nice options on the buffet and of course beautiful views from the restaurant.  We booked the pool for 7am each morning (you have to book ahead because of Covid rules) and started each day with a swim and sauna on the 52nd floor.  A fabulous hotel and absolutely recommended."
July 2021,Very nice room 4005 premier city view,"  check in easy enough a few forms to fill in and pre authorization of the card to be paid with. room great couldn't really ask for a better room, suites arnt always the best rooms. ICR 180‚Å∞ views. bathroom great view. nice heated toilet seat. in room service easy enough they set a table for you and bring it in to use. pricey for what you get some dishes are good value and some are not. Room service/House keeping very good. "
July 2021,The most memorable stay in my life,"My husband and I decided to stay at the Shangrila here in London to celebrate our marriage and I honestly didn‚Äôt expect anything from them. However, upon walking into the room, not only did they arrange in advance to upgrade us tmr the suit, there was a huge bouquet of flowers for us, canap√©s, champagne and a lovely message on the window.  They did not only do this for our room, they did it for our parents room as well- giving them the same wonderful experience we received. But wait, that was only day 1. There was even more for our second day. The experience was extraordinary. I‚Äôve never felt so much love and care from any hotel before. They made our wedding all the more magical And all the more memorable. I can safely say that this experience was truly special for us. Thank you‚Ä¶"
July 2021,Afternoon tea,I visited for afternoon tea with my son to celebrate a 'special' birthday. We were looked after by Marco who was very attentive and delightful. Food was delicious and plentiful. We had a table close to the window and it was a clear day so views were spectacular. Would highly recommend .
June 2021,"Beautiful views, exceptional customer service","We stayed at the hotel with my friends for my birthday celebrations. During our stay the customer service was exceptional,the view from our rooms was so beautiful  and the staff were extremely helpful and polite. The breakfast was amazing and the quality of the food was great, we also used the sky pool and sauna with breathtaking views and nice drinks. Overall we were so welcomed and impressed and we definitely recommend Shangri-la.  Thank you once again for making it a birthday to remember!  Maria Bloufa"
July 2021,Hugh G,"Wow what can I say. I surprised my girlfriend with a stay here for our 1st year together and we were blown away.. The view from the room amazing, the restaurants amazing, staff amazing. You can't find fault with this hotel."
July 2021,Well worth it!,"This was a total London bucket list item for me and we splashed out for our wedding anniversary. First impressions weren't brilliant because of the rather disorganised, lengthy queue at reception and an unexplained wait of around 20 minutes for our room despite arriving after check-in time, but they provided a complimentary aperol spritz while we waited which set the tone for an above and beyond experience. I requested a bathroom with a view and we got this (WOW!! is all i can say about it)- along with a piece of cake and card for our anniversary delivered to the room that evening. Shangri La are known for their amazing service and they did not disappoint. The attendants at the sky pool (also WOW) were polite and helpful, and the gentleman who brought us room service was also‚Ä¶"
June 2021,Ting restaurant,"Emilio was brilliant, he faultlessly delivered us 5 courses and explained what ingredients was in our food. He was very knowledgable and he will definitely influence us to visit again. Thankyou Emilio."
June 2021,Perfection!,"Perfect as always. Another gorgeous room, staff that cater for your every need. Amazing. You cannot fault this hotel from the moment you arrive. The food is delicious the staff are friendly the room and views are amazing. Used the pool and gym which also have stunning views."
July 2021,"Overall, wonderful.","I was treated to a night at the Shangri-la for my birthday, everything was perfect! The bed was comfy (and huge), Ting served the loveliest food with quality ingredients, the most perfect eggs and gorgeous cocktails, the view was obviously incredible and the pool was a great way to start the next morning - 10/10 for everything above.   We were however very disappointed to find that the amount of gratuity we left for the gentleman who brought us breakfast had doubled. It wasn't a huge amount, the money isn't the problem.. it's the dishonesty from (I'm guessing) a very small percentage of staff. Unfortunately we didn't actually find out until we were home, upon checkout we trusted our bill would be accurate, lesson learned!   We would definitely stay again but would 100% take a‚Ä¶"
August 2023,Best birthday ever!,We had an amazing time from the start having Rita helping with the check in and all the questions we had. She also went the extra mile and delivered a cake for my boyfriend‚Äôs 30th birthday. We really appreciated it.  The infinity pool was very relaxing and the views was breathtaking. Thank you for such an amazing experience!
August 2023,Jing is amazing,Amazing experience and so romantic for couples - our server Jing was amazing and catered to out every whim I couldn‚Äôt recommend a better place for afternoon tea!!! The food is fabulous and so is the decor/views. Definitely a must try if you get the chance to go!!!
July 2023,Excellent would go again,We booked this for our anniversary as an indulgent treat. It‚Äôs not cheap and we knew that. We could have gone to Spain for a week for the same price as two nights. But this was about spoiling ourselves. And we did. We had our car so parked in Q Parks 12 min walk away. Trying to get anywhere near the Shard in a car was hopeless. Even the taxis we used whilst there struggled. Often dropping us at the end of the road or on the other side of the station. This is due to so many bike lanes being opened and road closures. So be warned.  From arrival when they took our cases from our hands until the end. We loved it all. We‚Äôve been in Gong a few times before for drinks. So we didn‚Äôt venture in this time. After all we had amazing views from our room.   Room‚Ä¶.  We didn‚Äôt pay for river‚Ä¶
July 2023,Just surreal,"Great customer service from start to finish. The bell boys/concierge on the ground floor are just lovely - so friendly and welcoming. We had room 4304 which was a corner room- it was just wow. We had everything we needed for example iron, bottle opener , wine glasses, water, toiletries. Turn down service available, our room was clean and tidy when we came back in the evening. Everything was perfect. Just avoid the Ting restaurant  at all costs. Hutong , and Roast a million times better.  Roast in borough market does a great breakfast - 2 minutes walk away"
July 2023,The most luxurious home hotel in london,"The only hotel in London that feels like your home - exceptional on every level with exemplary service and hospitality which starts with the amazing doormen Gilt, Niel and Ivai and continues all the way through  Discreet, classy and beyond luxury "
July 2023,Massages,Amazing experience at spa. Really good massage. Whole family has been so far for various treatments and they have been amazing. Professional and helpful staff with a good consultation before. I personally had Fouzia who gave clear advice for my personal needs and focused on areas where I had greatest discomfort. Will come again!
July 2023,Family vacation with a 4 year old,"Brown‚Äôs might be one of the best hotels I‚Äôve stayed at for traveling with toddlers/young kids. We stayed there for a week in early July and had a wonderful time. I got in touch with the hotel concierge by email prior to arrival and they helped me arrange transportation and book restaurants for our stay. The guest services representative also helped me arrange a great surprise for my husband‚Äôs birthday.   When we arrived, I was amazed by the small details that made our stay so relaxing - a set of kids toiletries, kids slippers and a bath robe in exact size my daughter wears, fresh flowers in the room, a fresh fruit basket and packages delivered to the room (and not simply left at front desk), just to name a few. Then there was a beautifully decorated ceiling in reception desk‚Ä¶"
June 2023,Great Spa,"The spa center is welcoming and comfortable. They use very good organic oils and do nut rush the treatment. My massage therapist Fouzia was great, applied the right pressure and technique to solve my lower back problem! "
July 2023,Exquisite Spa Experience,"I have been coming the Browns Spa for 10 years and it has never disappointed. From the greetings, to the tea, to the treatment and the exit, the entire experience and customer care is first rate in London. Very cozy, not touristy, quintessential English. Highly recommend for road warriors and just simply relaxation. Eric G."
June 2023,The Spa,Took my daughter for a special 10th birthday treat at the spa. Aurora was amazing. Made my daughter feel so special. Definitely recommend this spa. Thank you Aurora for making this a special day. We will be back soon
September 2023,100% recommendation,"Everything was perfect. The service, the room, the breakfast and especially the cocktails in the Donovan Bar. The staff were very attentive and always helpful and friendly. The room was stylishly decorated, very clean and very comfortable. We were absolutely satisfied with our stay and can recommend the hotel one hundred percent."
September 2023,Ultimate British Experience,"We loved Browns Hotel.  The Hotel completely redecorated  all the public rooms recently and they are  stunning.  The vibe is traditional, elegant and yet very comfortable and inviting.  The staff is very friendly and well trained.  They can not do enough for you and are most polite and kind.  We ate at Donovans 2 times (the bar and informal dining room). The food was excellent.  Our accommodation was upgraded to The Browns Suite which was the size of a small apartment with 2 bathrooms.  Staying at Browns is the ultimate British experience with a true sense of place."
September 2023,Lovely hotel ,An elegant hotel in a great location. The room is well appointed and the service excellent.  I tebd to hace trouble sleeping while traveling but was comfortable and slept well here.  Lots of nice touches.
August 2023,Surprised this is rated 5 star,"Very disappointing experience after staying in many other London 5 star hotels (Claridge's, Cannaught, Mandarin Oriental, all of the Firmdale hotels, etc). This is simply not in the same category. The lobby is tiny but very lovely and the restaurants downstairs are nice. But the rooms are a bit shabby and old feeling, like staying in a grandmother's house. We booked through Platinum Amex and the hotel refused to acknowledge our contracted Amex benefits, causing a headache for us. Would not recommend if you are looking for London's finest. "
May 2023,Classic English Luxury,"Stunning hotel in Mayfair with large suites that feel like home. Incredible staff who are kind, friendly and warm. Fabulous design, between the rooms and the common spaces. This hotel is cozy yet spacious. I loved everything!"
September 2023,"When in London, BROWNS HOTEL IT MUST BE. Hands down. ","Everything about Browns is a superlative description. As soon as you arrive, the staff is at its finest. Helpful. Accommodating. Extends their assistance beyond their task. The hotel is clean. Concierge Gerard and his team are very knowledgeable of our needs and about explaining the ins and outs of London. The TEA was exquisite. I can‚Äôt imaging myself searching for other hotels. The rooms are squeaky clean which is very important to me. The bathroom smells freshly cleaned. No odor at all. The sheets smell like they had just been washed. Yes, clean. The pillows are comfortable. Housekeeping is very responsive. I called for coffee at 9am and in 10 minutes, voila. Unlike other hotels where you wait until you‚Äôve forgotten that you had ordered it an hour ago. Everyday in the‚Ä¶"
September 2023,London Weekend,"Always a great experience to be at Brown‚Äôs in the centre of Mayfair. A very nice hotel with a very unique atmosphere. The staff regardless of which area reception, restaurant and bar or room service are all very friendly and helpful and always ready to respond to the customer‚Äôs request. The whole ambiance is simply very beautiful and radiates a cosy and pleasant atmosphere. In any case, also on the next visit to London at Brown‚Äôs."
September 2023,Our favourite place to stay in London,"My husband and I have been staying at Browns for some ten years now whenever we‚Äôre in London for a few nights.  It‚Äôs always a treat and the service lives up to that intention.  We‚Äôve stayed in a variety of rooms from the Superior Room through to the Junior Suites and they are just so well appointed, comfortable and spacious given the age of the building.  Our favourite thing about staying is not only the jolly greeting you get every time you enter the hotel (the doormen are so friendly and helpful) but also its the drinks at the Donovan bar. Taking a drink there feels very civilised which is a weird compliment but the design of the place lends it a very sophisticated atmosphere - subdued lighting, some cozy booths and a well made cocktail always starts off an evening out on the‚Ä¶"
September 2023,"Classic elegance, stylish, top service in wonderful location!","My stay at Browns was one of the best experiences lately in my life!  Classic elegant decor, silence in the rooms, discreet service that guesses what you need in the best location possible. The tea at Browns is one of my favorites in London! "
December 2022,Home away from home!,"First but certainly not last time we will stay at Brown‚Äôs. Nothing short of perfect. From check-in to check-out we were made to feel like we belonged. The entire staff made a point of knowing us, our preferences and our needs. Just to name a few, John at the door, Richard and Gerard at the Concierge Desk, everyone at Reception, Charlie‚Äôs Front of House staff, Rocco in The Drawing Room for tea, and everyone at Donovan Bar. (Please all forgive me for leaving anyone out, because I would run out of space naming you all) As far as hotel itself, charming to say the least. And location in Mayfair can‚Äôt be beat. Of particular service note, I had a very bad case of sciatica that required constant icing. The overnight staff took amazing care of me, and Richard at Concierge desk found me‚Ä¶"
June 2023,A superb experience!,"We absolutely loved our three night stay. This is one of the most classical London hotels. It manages to balance history with updated design and service levels. Personnel is extremely professional and service minded. They all adress you by your surname and welcomes you ""home"" every time you arrive back at the hotel. And it does feel like your home away from home.  Afternoon Tea at Brown¬¥s is a classic and breakfast in Charlies restaurant is a venue to be enjoyed for at least an hour. The restaurant is so nicely decorated and the food and service impeccable.   The location is one of London¬¥s finest right in the middle of Mayfair close to some of the best restaurants and shopping the city has to offer. Their chauffeur driven Bentley service is an extra plus, particularly if you‚Ä¶"
July 2023,A lovely anniversary,It was our wedding anniversary and we decided to return to Browns having had such a nice stay before. We hoped for a similar experience but if anything this time was even better. I have mobility issues and despite what everyone says some places aren‚Äôt accessible friendly but I couldn‚Äôt fault the staff at Browns. We  had drinks in the cocktail bar and ate at Charlie‚Äôs. Again a superb meal. It‚Äôs a true delight to see things done properly and they were but with such kindness and friendliness ! The staff were excellent. We‚Äôd recommend the experience wholeheartedly. Truly memorable and worth every penny 
July 2023,Our London Home,"We spend a decent amount of time in London and have experimented with a broad range of hotels. With Brown‚Äôs, we have finally found our London home. Gracious, elegant, friendly, sophisticated, highly professional, lovely, and responsive to every request, Brown‚Äôs provides the environment that both relaxes and energizes. "
June 2023,Mummy and daughter spa day.,"For my daughters 9th birthday (December 2022) I made a booking for the Mummy & Daughter spa. One of the reasons I chose this particular spa is because of my daughters age. Most spas will not do treatments on children of this age.   The day started badly due to train strikes, so therefore we were a little late. When we arrived I filled the required consent forms and we were taken through to our treatment room. Both the ladies Olga and Fouzia were wonderful. After our mad rush due to the trains I was worried we would miss our booking and was completely stressed. But the ladies put me at ease. We had chosen our treatments, nails and a massage each in a joint treatment room. At the end of the treatment the ladies bought my daughter a cake with a candle on for her birthday and sang‚Ä¶"
April 2023,Absolute perfection,"I've stayed in many hotels offering superb service, with outstanding attention to detail. None of them - and I mean none - are up to Brown's standard. Staff can't do enough for you. Pleasant, courteous and utterly professional at all times. Breakfast superb, bar a solid win. The room was marvellous, and that bed was the comfiest that my wife and I have ever slept in. If I could have stayed on, I'd be there still. Utterly flawless stay. "
June 2023,Unbelievable team and service at a historical hotel,"Staying here made me nostalgic for what hotels used to feel like when everyone knew your name and made you feel extremely welcomed as if you were guests of their own home.  Givi was wonderful and everyone was so eager to assist‚ÄîNatasha from housekeeping quickly helped me with my bags when she saw me in the lift.   Their attention to detail and incredible service would make me pick them over Claridge‚Äôs or any of the larger hotels in London.   Truly have not stayed anywhere with better service in recent memory.   Thank you for the wonderful stay! And also, obsessed with their pillows and sheets! Also something very romantic about staying in the oldest hotel in London! "
May 2023,Wonderful Spa,"The spa was such a lovely and relaxing experience, I highly recommend to anyone! My therapist Hannah was so sweet and took care to go over my needs beforehand, as well as leaving me with a helpful list of products and info afterwards. The spa receptionist Erica was great as well and created a calm environment. The massage was just what I needed after traveling and the facial left me so refreshed but was gentle enough not to irritate my skin. Will definitely return next time I‚Äôm in London!"
May 2023,Sun Bronzing ,Hannah was welcoming and very efficient.  She did a lovely job in my spray tan and was very helpful during the entire process.  She made this treatment more relaxing especially as this was my first time!    She is a lovely person 
May 2023,Home!,"We were at Brown's in April this year for 8 nights. We were traveling with our 5 year old son and booked a junior suite. Brown's is perfect for families. It's home! every day on our return from excursions around town, my son excitedly used to say ""We're home"". He felt at home! The entire team at brown's made sure we were taken care of. Location is in the heart of Mayfair and as good as it can be for London. A special mention of Ivan and John at Brown's who  went out of their way to make our stay special and developed a bond with our family. We will definitely be back"
April 2023,Unmatched service and comfort at Brown's,"We spent last weekend at Brown's Hotel celebrating our 45th Wedding Anniversary. From the greeting on our arrival until our departure on the Sunday we could not have been looked after any better. The staff were all friendly,  kind and considerate and prepared to go ""that extra mile"". Our suite was spacious, comfortable and cozily unfussy and the breakfasts tip top. It is seldom that you cannot find anything that could have been just a little bit better -  but that was our experience during our stay at Brown's. The Hotel is wonderfully positioned in the West End allowing us to walk to the various shows and exhibitions we went to."
February 2023,This is the place to stay if you want to avoid crowds,"Excellent hotel in the heart of Mayfair. Hotel had a boutique feel to it as there are not crowds of people. The staff addressed us by name every time we came and went. The concierge service was outstanding, checking on our lost luggage and also changing a lunch reservation for us.  We booked through AE platinum and received a couple of upgrades. Breakfast was delicious and it was ordering off the menu instead of a buffet. We enjoyed the breakfast.  We will stay at the Browns again next time in London. This was our 2nd stay there."
February 2023,"A fabulous, quaint hotel ","What a fabulous, quaint hotel. We went with my 16 month old son, and they made everything seamless. The restaurant was super sweet to him even though he made a mess. Housekeeping was wonderful cleaning up after us and providing lots of water. Concierge made booking shows, and restaurants very easy. Bellman Gigi, Simeon, Jorge and John were always so welcoming. Every time we came back to the hotel. They helped us secure and load a taxi big enough for all of our luggage.   Highly recommend and can‚Äôt wait to be back!"
February 2023,Feeling at home in Mayfair,The hotel feels like coming home. Everybody was trying its best.  The atmosphere is like living in a nice town house in the hard of Mayfair. One of my best hotel experiences I had in my life.  Thank you very much.  Christian 
February 2023,Amazing Facials in Spa,Over the last year we have been coming to this spa every 2 months or so for facial treatments. Every time the service and quality of the facial is 10 out of 10. Last time we went we had Aurora and Fuzia (sorry if spellings are wrong!) and they were both amazing! Ruta as well is also incredible when we have had her. We will definitely keep coming back as everything is perfect. 
February 2023,Truly a 5 star experience. ,"I stayed there with my wife and 1.5yr old son. We had a lovely time here. Everyone was so nice and accommodating. They were so kind to my son as he ran around the hotel saying hi to the staff. They even gave him this little wooden monkey toy in our room. It's in an excellent location, near the tubes but walking distance to Picadilly circus. When we go to London again we would be hard pressed to stay anywhere else but here."
February 2023,A welcome like no other!,The customer service at Browns was exemplary. When you stay at Brown‚Äôs you are made to feel as if it is your home. It was a privilege to be a guest. Staff went above an beyond to accommodate an extra family member and our grateful thanks go to the team. Browns isn‚Äôt cheap but it is so worth it.
February 2023,Birthday Afternoon Tea ,"My son and daughter-in-law went at the end of February to have afternoon tea at The Drawing Room, Browns Hotel as a Birthday treat I wanted flowers for my daughter-in-law as a Birthday surprise. The hotel staff were fantastic in assisting. Their in house florist made up a beautiful bouquet and photos were sent to me of the flowers on the table.  I had excellent and prompt email contact with staff at The Drawing Room, liaising about cost, flower type and payment arrangements. They could not have done more.  The feedback from my son and daughter-in-law regarding their special afternoon was totally positive - a really delicious tea, they were treated extremely well and made to feel special. We would recommend The Drawing Room as a lovely place to have tea. "
February 2023,Luxury & Personal,We checked into the Brown's Hotel for 1 night for a long-awaited staycation in London. Upon entering we were welcomed by the lovely doormen who then brought us to reception where Hasiya checked us in and gave us a beautiful tour of the facilities and even brought us up to our room. It was beyond elegant and luxurious with a handwritten letter which made the experience feel more authentic. A big thank you to Irene from guest experiences who arranged romantic amenities for our arrival (my fiance was definitely surprised).  Bianca from the Drawing room and Dimitri from Charlie's gave us wonderful service. The only negative was we didn't stay long enough! 
February 2023,Genuine hospitality at the heart of London,"Brown's Hotel is unlike any lavish hotels yet we were welcomed by such great hospitality & approachable staff from the doorman, Ivan to Ashiya who checked us in. Loved the interior and cleanliness of the room. The hotel is very accessible to different shops and restaurants, but we chose to have dinner in the hotel's restaurant, Charlie's. I remember the hostess Marina & waiters Rebecca and Luigi have attended to us very well. The crab starter is a must try & the steak perfectly cooked! Also loved the breakfast food and service from the same restaurant. Overall an excellent experience staying in London's first hotel!"
February 2023,Brown‚Äôs Hotel is second to none in London,"A stay at Brown‚Äôs makes London truly special and it all starts with the team who treat all like family. From Daniel at the front door and Giv√≠ once inside, the Brown‚Äôs team at reception, Charlie‚Äôs, Donovan‚Äôs and everything in-between sets them and your experience apart in every way. Highly recommended!"
February 2023,Birthday spa treatments ,"Booked spa treatments (softening facials and funky fingers) for my twin 13yr old daughters as a surprise treat. Beautiful environment, warm and friendly welcome. Hanna took the initial booking, very easy to do. She was very kind and professional over the phone. Aroure and Natalie did the treatments and made my girls feel so special, they loved every minute. Many thanks to everyone for a fabulous morning not to forget the doormen who greeted us and showed us the way down to the spa. "
February 2023,Spa experience,"Irene Forte facial treatment was on my schedule, and I was excited from the moment I walked into the spa reception. When offering me a cup of tea, the beautiful lady requested that I fill out the simple form. After that, a therapist led me to a treatment room where, after the frantic noise of the streets, you feel incredibly warm and tranquil, and this is where the spa's magic starts. I had a memorable facial treatment thanks to the setting up therapist, Aurora. I appreciate your kindness and your welcome, Hanna, as well."
February 2023,Wonderful stay at the Browns Hotel,"We spent a few days -for a visit at Chris de Burghs concert- at this lovely (and oldest) hotel in London. Starting with a warm welcome at the airport, an unexpected upgrade room with a wonderful view and the lovliest people around us during the days. We enjoyed a relaxing spa treatment, had a delicious meal and stayed for a drink at Donovans Bar. It was a great pleasure to be with you and we will never forget all of the amazing english roses on Valentine¬¥s Day!"
February 2023,Overdelivers for 5-star hotel in central London. Top hospitality team.,"February 9-14, 2023.  Entire Brown's staff was welcoming, accessible, responsive and reliable! Such a great hospitality team is seemingly rare these days.  Suite was absolutely beautiful, cleaned and prepped impeccably daily.  Mattress and linens most comfortable.  Charlie's is a good as any restaurant in Mayfair. Spacious and comfortable.  Access to shopping and transportation is excellent -yet so walkable to best areas and sites in London.  Evenings at Brown's are comfortably elegant; quiet local streets in central London.  Have stayed at 5-star London hotels since 1986. Brown's was tops! Overall: overdelivers for 5-star hotel in central London.  "
January 2023,Very professional and friendly staff,"I visited this weekend as a treat for my daughters 14th birthday.  I had a slight hiccup with the original booking time which was my fault. The receptionist was very accommodating and managed to fit us in for a later time. I am very grateful for that.  I had a facial and my daughter a facial and massage, which she really enjoyed. An explanation was given on the products used and how to maintain a skin care regime, which was helpful to my teenage daughter. They also surprised her with a small cake with a little candle in it. This was a nice touch and made her feel extra special.  I really want to thank Federica and Fouzia who carried out our treatment, they were both very friendly and made us feel very welcome and comfortable.  All in all a lovely experience, will definitely be‚Ä¶"
January 2023,A must visit hotel in London,"As soon as we arrived were greeted by the amazing door and valet team. The staff were so incredibly kind and welcoming, from every at front desk and the concierges Givi and Simeon. The room was spectacularly put together for my birthday with my favourite flower being imported from abroad!  The food at Donovan's rivals any bar food I've ever had and the service at Charlie's was truly attentive without being overbearing. Thank you to the cleaning staff too, who did a wonderful turn down service for us which included rose petals all over the room - such an amazing touch. We will definitely be back to enjoy one of the best hotel experiences ever."
January 2023,Outstanding service,"We went for dinner in Charlie's Restaurant and we were very well looked after by Manuel, who was very attentive. We were warmly welcomed by Paul and, of course, the prominent and beloved Jesus. Gianluca made sure we had everything we need. We wish to thank them all very much for a beautiful evening and also to Alessandro, the sommelier. If you look for a quiet evening and delicious food, ambiance an friendly staff, Charlie's has all of them. Thank you!"
January 2023,Brilliant spa experience ,"I went to spa for a scrub and a massage. All I can say is that everything was very professional and friendly in the same time. I think this is the main characteristic which describes Brown's Hotel. Hanna was the one who welcomed me and described my treatments with a bright smile. Federica was my therapist and she was truly brilliant, her hands were magic and the friendly manner she approaches makes you feel more relaxed and comfortable. I would highly recommend it. Thank you both for a fresh start to the day! :)"
December 2022,Great hotel,"Everyone working there is trying their best to be cordial, inviting, friendly, and professional.  A shout out to the best two bartenders at the barFederico and Alessandro who were lively, friendly, and enthusiastic at their job behind the bar.  Also the front desk day manager Mr. Castelli who is respectful and extremely helpful.  The rooms are newly renovated, clean and attractive.  It's a cozy hotel with a beautiful service attitude.  I must say though:  the teatime menu (scones, cakes, and sandwiches) can really truly use an improvement.  The teatime and tea room (which is very attractive) is extremely popular.  I have a feeling it's due to its ambiance and not so much the quality of the tea time offerings.  The bread was dry, the scones- uh not so great also dry and‚Ä¶"
January 2023,BEWARE - Theft during stay !!!!!!!!!!! Put every single valuable item in your safe or else..,"I am very disappointed in Browns and the fact that I need to write this review. After staying at Browns during the festive period, I returned home to the US and when I went to take my US dollars out of the side zipper of my cosmetic bag, I discovered it was missing! I had placed it in the bag at the beginning of our stay knowing I would not be using USD. This was my worst mistake, trusting hotel staff and no placing the cash in the safe. However, I have stayed at many 5 star hotels in the past and never thought it would be something to worry about in such an expensive place. Unfortunately, there was not a point during our stay when I noticed it missing and it was not until we returned home when I immediately alerted the hotel security team. While they did tell me that they‚Ä¶"
November 2022,Best hotel in the world,"Fantastic hotel.  Wonderful location.  Excellent restaurant.  But, it is the service and the people who make Brown's the finest hotel in the world.  A special shout-out to the concierge folks -- particularly, Lee and Richard -- who are wonderful, and possibly clairvoyant."
November 2022,Perfect Stay at our new go to London Hotel,"Traveling as a couple with two adult daughters. We have never stayed at Brown's prior to this trip but have stayed at other Rocco Forte properties.   Brown's was not our go to in London but thought to give it a try this trip.   Great decision.  The doorman greeted us and helped us and our luggage out of the cab.  Our checkin was seamless and hostess most gracious and informative.  Both rooms were upgraded at check in with our American Express program and  we received two beautifully  appointed, absolutely quiet junior suites facing Albermarle street.   The hostess escorted us to our room and reviewed the features with us.  The concierge found us a late lunch and made the call to get us in.  He provided maps and we went on our separate errands.   The Donovan bartenders were a‚Ä¶"
November 2022,Impromptu visit to the Donovan Bar,"Had the pleasure to visit the fabulous Donovan Bar at Brown‚Äôs Hotel. It was an impromptu visit and the bar was already buzzing when we arrived early evening, but the staff was so welcoming and found us a table in no time. The atmosphere is cosy, and the surroundings luxurious and classy, but the stars of the show were obviously the wonderful cocktails üç∏üòç My friend and I didn‚Äôt know what to choose from the wide selection, thankfully the staff were so helpful and spot on with their suggestions! I will definitely come back and strongly recommend, for a cheeky cocktail with a friend before dinner (they also have an amazing restaurant Charlie‚Äôs) or a romantic date to impress!"
October 2022,Londons number 1 hotel and our home from home,"We have just returned from an amazing 2 night stay at Browns Hotel.  The hotel is situated in the heart of Mayfair surrounded by high end shops and restaurants and within walking distance of many of Londons top attractions. However, staying in this hotel surrounded by its history and so many amenities, there is no need to step outside the door if you do not want too. On arrival we were greeted at the door with ‚Äúwelcome home‚Äù and that is how we were made to feel during our whole stay - at home. We dined at Charlie‚Äôs restaurant and welcomed in the New Year in The Donovan Bar. All the staff from the door staff reception staff, bar staff, waiting staff, housekeeping and managers are second to none. We have been fortunate to stay in many 5 star hotels throughout the world, but we‚Ä¶"
October 2022,Mr. Paul the waiter service the Afternoon Tea,"Paul the waiter was amazing, he treated us so lovely. Please ask for him when you go he will make your evening amazing. The afternoon tea was incredible and the service was 10/10 with constant smiles from the whole team. "
October 2022,What a wonderful hotel!!,"I have stayed with my family at this amazing hotel for three nights and it was just wonderful. Everyone was so friendly and attentive. The service was incredibly great from arrival to the seasonal amenities, from the dooman to the bar staff.  We loved our rooms with a useful connecting door. Everything was well maintained and clean."
September 2022,Best Teatime in London,"I had the best teatime ever! My friend and I enjoyed the fresh selections of sandwiches and desserts!  Look for Paul, who served us, he was so sweet and professional which made our experience unforgettable! Definitely coming back again! Great food, amazing location! Such a beautiful English tradition hotel in the middle of most beautiful area in London "
October 2022,First Class Afternoon Tea,"  I have been meaning to write for a while to say a thank you to Yonka and her team (I cannot recall the lovely male manager‚Äôs name, which is remiss of me) who looked after us all so well at a 30th birthday afternoon tea that we had with you on on the 1st October this year. As always they were delightful and our children were so well looked after.  We look forward to seeing everyone soon for our annual Christmas afternoon tea. A wonderful team and the afternoon tea was not only delicious but also plentiful    "
October 2022,Best afternoon tea in London!,"By far the best afternoon tea experience we had in London! The tea sommelier is excellent, the shrimp salad sandwich was delicious, and the pastries and scones were great. The service was far more attentive than anywhere else we have had tea. "
September 2022,Wonderful Time at Brown's Hotel London,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Brown‚Äôs Hotel last week ‚Äì we cannot stop smiling!    From the warm welcome we received from the Brown‚Äôs driver (Dragon) to the Bellmen (Daniel was amazing ‚Äì as were the rest of the kind bellmen), to the reception and concierge professionals friendly and supportive assistance, Charlie‚Äôs restaurant hostess, wait staff, and manager who made our meals memorable (and delicious) , the housekeeping staff who always kept our rooms beautiful (the fresh flowers were an unexpected and lovely touch ‚Äì thank you!), to the Brown‚Äôs Spa personnel who helped me relax on our much needed vacation, to finally the bartenders in Donavan‚Äôs bar who made us laugh and end each night happy and excited about the next day‚Äôs adventures.  I had spent many‚Ä¶"
August 2022,Walking Girls' Lunch Treat,"The restaurant in Brown's Hotel, Charlie's, is as fabulous as ever.  Beautifully decorated, sumptuous seating with plenty of space between tables, it was an absolute delight to return with 5 guests.  Having been given one of the tables with the semi-circular banquette seating on one side with beautiful cushions, felt like a treat in itself rather than having a conventional table and chairs. The menu was so alluring that we couldn't resist having 3 courses rather than the usual 2 when dining together. Four out of 6 of us were delighted to find calves liver and bacon on the menu, which was delicious.  However, I remember one guest enjoying a delicious Salmon En Croute as the special that day which would also have got my vote, being a lover of pastry.  As usual, the service was‚Ä¶"
August 2022,A very English experience,We dined at Charlie‚Äôs at the hotel. What a lovely experience starting with the pre dinner cocktails which were much enjoyed. The quiet ambiance of the restaurant was echoed by the excellent and attentive staff and the food was of a  very high standard and presentation  (although I thought my steak tartare was a tad lacking in seasoning and a bit wet). We will certainly return.
August 2022,Old school charm meets modern quality,Super friendly and professional especially Charles from guest relations. Made our trip special with personal touches agreed in advance. Wonderful room service team and food; champagne on ice placed when requested; huge comfy super king in our suite; etc etc etc. For a classic treat with modern touches; choose Browns!
July 2022,The Best Ever,"Our first visit here, and hopefully not our last. Wow, and double wow. Every single aspect of our stay here was perfect, from the moment we arrived and the fabulous staff who made us feel welcome, to the gorgeous room (way bigger than we expected) and then fabulous drinks in the bar and a 5 star dinner at Charlies. Even the breakfast room service (an extra treat for us) was fabulous. Couldn't fault a thing - the most special hotel we have encountered."
July 2022,"The perfect tea time: elegant, comfortable, and delicious!","The atmosphere was wonderful. It was both very fancy and very comfortable at the same time. The setting was intimate. We liked that the doorman greeted us, and we enjoyed the live piano during the tea. The service was great.   The tea selection was absolutely amazing. Each of us got to choose individually a tea to have during the savory part and then a second tea to have during the sweet part.   Each guest chooses individually between the two menu options ‚Äì traditional afternoon tea or plant based (vegan) afternoon tea. That worked out very well for us. Two in the group chose the traditional afternoon tea, and two of us, who are vegetarians, chose the plant-based afternoon tea.  The sandwiches were excellent. The meat eaters loved the coronation chicken ones, in particular. The‚Ä¶"
July 2022,A lovely overnight stay,We had the most wonderful time at Browns hotel this week. Beautiful suite so stylish and comfortable.  Staff real friendly and helpful.  Meal in browns restaurant was very good. I loved the grilled prawn starter and they had pistachio ice cream on the menu a lovely surprise and ending to a meal.  Amazing choice on breakfast menu and it was delicious.  A visit to Donovan‚Äôs bar really worth it recommend honey bear cocktail.
July 2022,Best ever Afternoon Tea!,"We have just had the best Afternoon Tea ever! Nothing was too much trouble for the friendly and efficient staff. We were asked more than once if we would like more of the gorgeous sandwiches, scones and cakes. At the end, we were presented with another pot of tea. Cannot recommend Brown's enough."
July 2022,Weekend at Brown‚Äôs,"My wife and I had a 3 night stay at the Brown‚Äôs hotel. It was wonderful. We had a great time, everyone from the doorman to the front desk were courteous, helpful and pleasant. The room was wonderful, the bed was comfortable and the living area was very nice. The hotel was located in a safe area and walking distance to many sights. Would love the opportunity to stay there again."
July 2022,Amazing experience,"I have had an amazing time at the Brown‚Äôs hotel, it‚Äôs a gorgeous place and the staff are lovely and so accommodating, they always stop to have a chat! I will absolutely come again next time I am visiting."
July 2022,Birthday Tea,"My brother and I had an incredible experience for afternoon tea at the Brown‚Äôs Hotel in London. Our server, Rocco, was funny, charming and very knowledgeable of the menu and hotel. He made sure all our requests were met, having personally read our reservation notes. The live piano music was such a nice backdrop and the food is delicious and just keeps coming! Thanks, Rocco, for a wonderful afternoon!"
May 2022,Great traditional hotel,I can‚Äôt say enough about how wonderful this hotel is. Truly a five-star experience With personalized service. The location is perfect for exploring London. Close to shopping and the Palace. Irene at Reception and concierge Dave head were friendly helpful and truly interested in making your stay terrific
February 2022,Afternoon Tea,"We've just had a wonderful Afternoon Tea at Brown's. It was so lovely stepping into the elegant, airy Victorian Drawing Room out of the intense heat. Paul, our principal waiter, immediately set the tone for us - he was such fun. The food was absolutely delicious. After the sandwich selection (we loved the coronation chicken in particular and our daughter said that the Vegetarian selection was the best selection she'd ever had), came the most delectable scones ever. They were sooo good, along with the yummy strawberry jam (which can be purchased). These were followed by delicious cakes, then more cakes - so it was good we hadn't asked for more sandwiches! The little grape tarts, the  Baked Alaska tarts and the little cream buns were divine. The Victoria sponge was also gorgeous.‚Ä¶"
May 2022,Fantastic service at superb hotel,"Brilliant hotel with wonderful staff and a unique and special team.  We could not be more impressed with Browns.  What makes it so special is the incredible team and service culture.   The rooms are also superb and Charlie‚Äôs restaurant excellent.  We loved the Sunday night Jazz. And,  just to mention the wonderful Browns team again!!"
May 2022,Mrs,"Excellent visit to Browns spa with 3 friends, we all had different treatments which we would highly recommend. Beautiful products and surroundings , polite friendly staff, all very relaxing and enjoyable with a visit to the Donovan bar before hitting Charlie‚Äôs restaurant for supper ."
May 2022,A piece of heaven,"I was happy to have such a relaxing and nourishing olive oil treatment and massage from Anastasia and Olga. They were so professional and attentive. They even shared some skin care tips and gave me advice. I totally enjoyed this small break from a busy world. I will definitely come back. Thank you, ladies!"
May 2022,A Time Travel Experience of Afternoon Tea,"This is not the American Disney experience of afternoon tea. The real deal with quiet dignity and satisfying scrumptious sandwiches and sweets. The cozy nooks and crannies where mismatched overstuffed chair and low tables adds to the unique experience of an afternoon tea..Variety of teas to choose from, traditional tea sandwiches and an assortment of desserts."
April 2022,lovely stay at the Brown‚Äôs London,"My family experienced another lovely stay at the Brown‚Äôs. I want to highlight the warm welcome and excellent support by Mr Givi and Mr Ivan, perfect organization of transfers and dinners by the concierge team, the whole staff always paying great attention to their guest needs and requests. Always a pleasure to be back and feeling at home."
May 2022,The very best afternoon tea experience!,"My husband and I were visiting London from Denmark and the afternoon tea at the Brown‚Äôs Hotel made our 4-day stay so special and unforgettable. The hotel was a beautiful jewel of the city and the interior and ambiance were so elegant, the food and tea were delicate and most delicious and the service was superb. I enjoyed friendly talking with a kind staff, Bianca. We have been to a number of afternoon/high tea places in different countries, but we were so happy that we had the very best and UK‚Äôs traditional afternoon tea experience at the Brown‚Äôs in London!"
May 2022,Lovely hotel in excellent location,"Lovely hotel, our room was comfortable, bathroom was updated, however overall room could use an uplift. Location made up for it!  Turn down service, daily room service was excellent!  Downside was (it is a personal preference) the mattress.  Firm mattress, which feels like laying on top of the bed instead in bed. Every bone in my body was hurting, (for reference I am 112 lbs/50 kgs). Housekeeping tried to help with a topper, however a mattress like this is unfortunately not possible to change, it should be exchanged. If you share the bed with another person, every movement can be felt, there was literally no sleep possible, we stayed 5 nights.  We loved the restaurant, reception, concierge and doorman (Civi) was absolutely excellent, so was Barbara at the reception."
May 2022,"‚ÄúBrown‚Äôs,‚Äù Brown‚Äôs,‚Äù ‚ÄúBrown‚Äôs‚Äù","If you ask a well travelled, well connected‚Äî-and well heeled‚Äî-American where he tends to stay in London, the answer will invariably be, ‚ÄúBrown‚Äôs‚Äù‚Äî-and he‚Äôs right. The hotel is beautifully appointed, the rooms spacious and comfortable, the service flawless‚Äî-friendly, even jovial, thoughtful and attentive and caring without being in the least intrusive. I‚Äôm a convert. Still there are niggling doubts . The bathrooms are disappointing: The water pressure, particularly at the sinks, is simply inadequate, and the lighting above the sinks hopeless‚Äî even with the addition of an illuminated shaving mirror. I went on from London to a modest country hotel in Devon which, while incomparably simpler than.  Brown‚Äôs, had bathrooms more user friendly. And then there was this: At checkout I was‚Ä¶"
March 2022,A home from home in Mayfair,"We spent 5 nights at Browns in April 2022. While it is certainly on the pricier end of the spectrum of central London hotels, it absolutely exemplifies my personal definition of a 5 Star hotel.   To me, it's a feeling. Of course all of the basics expectations must be met, but then, additionally, all of those little things you don't think about - a smile and hello from every single staff member, comfortable chairs in the bedroom, excellent lighting for reading, well stocked mini bar, well stocked bookcases , a ""Welcome Home"" from the doorman, and perhaps a hundred other touches I didn't notice, but all added to the experience.  The location is perfect - we walked to Shaftesbury Ave to the theatre,  to Churchill's War Rooms and Westminster Abbey, and to any number of restaurants‚Ä¶"
February 2022,Exceptional hotel with amazing staff,"We spent our honeymoon at Brown's and everything was just perfect.  The staff is fantastic, they organized flowers, champagne and a handwritten welcome note.  We had stayed at Brown's before and staff members remembered our names. Everyone tries to make you feel really comfortable.  (When I got back from my morning run, the doorman was welcoming me with a bottle of water. It's just a small gesture but one that makes all the difference.) All the staff without exception are wonderful and set the experience at Brown's apart but Francesca, the guest experience executive went over and beyond to make our honeymoon exceptional. Dinner at Charlie's, the hotel restaurant, was delightful.  We highly recommend this Mayfair jewel and hope to be back in October."
February 2022,Extremely nice stuff!,Just wanted to leave this message here and say how much we enjoyed our stay! Super nice and helpful stuff! Big thanks to Givi and Ivan for always willing to help and being very professional. Will be definitely coming back!
February 2022,Wonderful staff. Wonderful stay. (Especially if you‚Äôre 6 foot 5 !),"Stayed for 5 nights. I think this is the best hotel I have recently stayed in while visiting London (others have been The Stafford, Dukes,  the Wellesley, the Sofitel‚Ä¶and The Connaught (although that was during lockdown to be fair). Wonderful front desk staff who were very accommodating a early 1pm check-in so that we could shower before a 2pm meeting.  The bed had a footboard attached to it and (as I am 6 foot 5) meant that it would be too small for me.. but with an hour a technician has unscrewed the footboard so I had unlimited leg room. Wonderful and something I have never seen before ! Super friendly door staff who make you feel like you are coming ‚Äúhome‚Äù. The bar stays open until 1am at the weekends. We will definitely be staying again !!"
February 2022,First choice without doubt!,"I return here most weeks for work because of the extremely friendly, professional and courteous staff. The accommodation and facilities never disappoint. Dennis the general manager is just brilliant, nothing is ever too much trouble, and it‚Äôs always lovely to see John‚Äôs smiling face to greet you at the front door!"
February 2022,Wonderfully attentive service in a beautiful setting,"My stay started with a  lovely welcome by the front desk and the staff who took care of every detail. While I‚Äôm staying at the hotel for a  vacation in April, I found myself there after my son who is studying abroad ended up in the hospital with tonsillitis. To say they made us feel at home would be an understatement! Dennis - the wonderful guest experience manager sent up bath salts, fruit and chocolate covered strawberries to welcome my son out of the hospital. Chris, the amazing concierge arranged for a humidifier and great reservations once we could head out and the Rado and the room service staff brought tea around the clock!  We cannot wait to head back in April and look forward to another fabulous stay."
February 2022,Quintessential London,"What a wondrous experience Brown‚Äôs is. Situated in the heart of Mayfair, it was a perfect location for my 3-day visit of the capitol. I absolutely loved the hotel‚Äôs d√©cor being a mix of both traditional and contemporary. The room was very spacious and cosy. The Donovan Bar was so very London with an amazing buzz and energy coupled with a perfect service.  But for me, probably the best part of my stay was the Staff. From the Reception staff to the breakfast Team, to the front Doormen to the waitresses at Donovan‚Äôs. The attention they gave to make my stay personalized and special was wonderful. With just the right balance between professionalism and personal attention, I think Sir Forte can be proud of his Team.  Thank-you all again for making my stay memorable. I WILL be back!"
February 2022,Off the chart amazing!!!,"Simply superb!! What more can I say? Saturday night and packed to the rafters yet still our service was sublime. Maria our hostess was quite Simply AMAZING, she was a great host but still had time to have a bit of banter with us. Truly one of the best waitresses we have ever met. Then the food, OMG, it was incredible. I would recommend to the highest degree "
February 2022,Wonderful stay!,We cannot recommend Brown‚Äôs highly enough for anybody wanting a special hotel stay. Attention to detail was second to none and we truly felt special on our birthday/anniversary visit. Thank-you  again.
February 2022,Wonderful Stay - As Always,Had another great few days in London at Brown's. Always to be treasured. Impeccable service and a fantastic restaurant. The staff are warm and genuine and go out of their way to help without being intrusive. One of a kind......
April 2022,"good hotel, god location. good service",This is a good hotel with a very good and dedicated staff to make you enjoy your stay. very important during these days. Food and beverage quality are good too. maybe some improvement could come from the kitchen. breakfast is very good but dinner dishes may improve a little. service is great. cleaning of the rooms too.  the hotel has a very good location for all kind o purpose (work or visiting).
March 2022,"Fourth stay, probably the last","Brown‚Äôs is a hotel in a beautiful old building. We have stayed here 4 times now  and it has some wonderful friendly staff and does, on the whole, make it feel like you are in a home away from home. Dennis was especially wonderful during our last stay. However, for a 5* Hotel it has shortcomings and falls below others in this price range. Occasional bad experiences are expected, but Brown‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt seem to listen to this feedback and use it to improve. Sadly it is unlikely we will be coming back again. Many of the rooms are very tired and while cosy and well designed, are in need of renovation. Their age is showing, especially in places such as the stained bathroom floors and general wear and tear to the furniture. Other oddities are the choice of a cheap kettle, basic Nescafe‚Ä¶"
March 2022,Amazing place to stay,"The stay was amazing. Big rooms, lots of common space, delicious afternoon tea.  Personal was very polite and helpful, especially Givi our consierge  was great! Located just in the center, close to bond street."
March 2022,An excellent hotel with wonderful people,"We spent four wonderful nights at Brown‚Äôs and we can only recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for an exceptional experience. The whole team was amazing, but our special thanks go to Francesca at the reception desk and Lee at the conciergerie for their kind help and hospitality. We are looking forward to our next stay."
March 2022,Fabulous!,"Just come back from a fabulous tea in The Drawing Room.  Exceptionally friendly and welcoming staff, lovely tea, but oh my word, those cakes!!  Totally wow!  My congratulations to Chef Reece.  A wonderful way to spend an afternoon.  Thank you very much."
February 2022,Wonderful experience,"My friend and I stayed at Browns as a special treat in prep for her wedding. All the staff without exception were wonderful; genuinely caring, professional, couldn‚Äôt do enough for us from the moment we arrived & were greeted at the door to the moment we left. The afternoon tea was a delight and everyone seemed to go out of their way to ensure we were well looked after. I would definitely recommend Browns as a special place to stay in London."
March 2022,A quirky hotel with charm,The hotel is made up of several older houses joined together and is the oldest hotel in London. The hotel has a certain uniqueness about it which gives it a non corporate feel. The staff were outstanding in their service and were very helpful. The only down side was we were near some outside vents that were a bit noisy.
March 2022,Afternoon Tea,"Lovely afternoon tea with the family. Delicious sandwiches and cakes, wide selection of teas and drinks. We enjoyed the beautiful settings and were well looked after by Bianca. Our favourite were the scones!!"
March 2022,A memorable family experience at Brown‚Äôs hotel,"We stayed at Brown‚Äôs with our 10 and 11 year old children for Spring Break. To say our stay was memorable would be an understatement. We loved this property. It was beautiful, rooms were comfortable, and it‚Äôs in a great location.  Our one bedroom suite was spacious. We had two rollaways set up in the living room for the kids and there was still plenty of room to relax and enjoy the space. The kids beds were personalized and came with a stuffed animal and book. We had amenities for the adults and the kids upon arrival.  We had breakfast in Charlie‚Äôs and the food was excellent. My husband and I had drinks in Donovan‚Äôs Bar at night and, wow, what a menu. The drinks did not disappoint.  But the staff set our experience apart. In particular, Dennis, the guest experience manager, went‚Ä¶"
February 2022,Beautiful hotel and best service in London,"We are so glad we selected Brown‚Äôs hotel to stay in for our family‚Äôs first visit to London since 2019. From the wonderful check in experience to drinks at the Donovan bar, Brown‚Äôs really takes customer service seriously. Our concierge Chris was next level amazing - he worked to get us the best reservations and organized the coolest hands on experience for our artistic tween daughter. Chris helped make our time in London the best part of our trip and Brown‚Äôs was a wonderful oasis in London."
February 2022,Lovely family feel.,"Staying at Browns is like staying with friends. The staff, food, accommodation are all lovely. Browns is the best of British, if you want service with a smile look no further. We have been three times in the last six months and we can‚Äôt wait until our next visit."
February 2022,Romantic stay,"The team at Brown's Hotel make u8s feel very special on out stay. From check in done by Andrea and Alex to check out. We were welcomed with a glass of champagne during our check in the Front desk team was very pleasant and accommodating. Our room was amaizing, very comfortable and we did received some tasty chocolates and other amenities. On our return from dinner at Charlie's restaurant we were welcomed with some rose petals spread on our bed and in the bathroom which was really nice surprise. The dinner was so delicious ang looked like a painting on the plate. Luigi and Gianluca were delightful during service, so easy to talk to. We did visit Donovan Bar for after dinner drinks. Once again we were welcomed very warmly by Martina. The team at the bar Alessandro and Daniele were‚Ä¶"
February 2022,"Wonderful Hotel, Staff & Best Location","I brought my Mum for her 90th Birthday and just wow! We had the best week end. My Mum felt very special, the staff all greeted her by name. The little extra thoughtful touches from the staff, the comfy rooms, the decor and the feel of the hotel made my Mum's Birthday one to remember. Thank you to Browns for a memorable week end. We would definitely recommend and return."
February 2022,London Weekend,"This was our second visit to Browns in the last 6mths and they welcomed us back like family. We had a touching card in our room (I know it‚Äôs probably standard but it was very nice) welcoming us to our Home from Home! Could not fault the service or rooms in fact our suite didn‚Äôt have his & hers wash basins but his & hers bathrooms!! Would highly recommend Browns for those special occasions, expensive but you get what you pay for!"
February 2022,Our Second home,"Amazing suites, exceptional, professional, caring and kind staff. This has been our second visit in few months as a family and everything was great and very well looked after. An experience of a life time. Thank you and goodbye till we meet again soon!"
February 2022,Amazing! Best hotel in London,"From start to finish the service was impeccable. The suite was stunning with every luxury you would expect. My two young children were made incredibly welcome and special touches were added just for them. None of us actually wanted to leave. The best staff, the best service, the best hotel and all in the best location."
January 2022,Best hotel in London,"Great doormen, great rooms, great bar, great service. I first went to Browns for Sunday afternoon tea in the 1980s and without losing any of its original charm it is now, in my opinion, the best hotel in London but keep it secret."
February 2022,Cocktails,"Fabulous cocktails as always In the 'bar' you are still required to stay at your table and they come to you, which if you're just drinking is not always the best However we love the cocktails and the bar area We are yet to try the food but on our next visit we will do"
January 2022,"Completely Overwhelmed , From Start To Finish.","Thank you doesn't really seem adequate. The team at Browns Hotel truly made my Mums birthday weekend. I understand that you have special guests all of the time, especially with it being Valentine's weekend, however they really did go above and beyond to make every single thing perfect.¬†  From start to finish, Olga in the Spa gave my mum a wonderful massage and made her feel comfortable and relaxed. The concierge team were always on hand to help and Francesca honestly did do everything in her power to make this trip memorable.   My mum was taken away by how wonderful everything was, honestly.¬†  This is some of the best service I have ever¬†witnessed and received.¬†The team at Browns hotel do the Rocco Forte Hotel brand proud, it was a complete pleasure and we will be back one day‚Ä¶"
January 2022,Afternoon tea,Afternoon tea was great. The food quality was really good and the service was excellent. We were hungry earlier than expected and they accommodated us despite being 2 hours early for our reservation. Yonka served us and taught us all about the teas we were drinking and the history of afternoon tea. She gave great recommendations and she was really funny. She made it a memorable experience
December 2021,Beyond compare,"This really has to be one of the very best hotels we have ever stayed in. It was impossible to find fault, no matter how small, with any aspects of our stay. The rooms are superb, the hotel position could not be bettered, the restaurants and bars are top class but most of all, our thanks go to the staff for making our stay so enjoyable. Their commitment to providing the very best in service is so obvious and nothing appears to be too much trouble for them. Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff - what more could you ask for?"
January 2022,Excellent service,"We came for dinner yesterday and we were impressed by Charlie's Restaurant's staff. They made our evening by taking care of us and smiling all the time.  On our arrival, Silvia greeted us with a bright smile. Luigi and Chloe made sure everything is perfect. It is obvious they all have great customer skills and knowledge about the menu. We want to thank them again for the excellent service they provided and for making us feel so special.  We recommended Charlie's to our friends üôÇ."
January 2022,Weekend treat with family,"Fantastic and seamless service from start to finish - Brown's always know the meaning of five stars. The pre-stay service, check-in, support throughout and dining experience was exceptional on every level."
January 2022,Family trip,Amazing beautiful and friendly five star hotel in top location! We stayed there with my teenage sons and it was perfect for them going out. The concierge was super helpful and the doorman so nice!  Thanks we will be back for sure. Carolin
January 2022,Excellence & finest hospitality,"Upon a pre-Christmas visit to London December 2021, I had the pleasure of partaking Christmas Afternoon Tea at Browns and was waited on by Yonka, an excellent example of the utmost welcoming professionalism & an exquisite asset of Browns who made me feel completely at ease, satisfied every whim & made extraordinary memories of a perfect winter‚Äôs afternoon respite at Browns."
December 2021,A birthday stay,"My parents booked a trip for us to stay at The Browns hotel for my birthday. From start to finish the stay was superb. I was lucky enough to liaise with Dennis, the Guest Experience Manager who was fantastic and did so much to make our stay special.  From the moment we arrived none of the staff could do more to help, everyone was friendly, helpful and always smiling. Even when the shift changeover happened we were greeted by name with a smile. We had dinner in Charles and it was amazing, food was to a very high standard and again the staff were fantastic. I was actually sad to leave and we loved it so much we will be going back in September to celebrate my Mum's birthday."
December 2021,Mr John Ball,"We recently spent a wonderful stay at Browns Hotel and dined at Charlies Restaurant, where the food was amazing. We were treated like royalty from the moment of our arrival at Browns and throughout our stay.  The staff were super professional whilst at the same time exuding warmth and kindness. They even surprised us with a handwritten card, cake and bottle of champagne to our room when they found out we were celebrating a birthday. One of the factors that made us pick Browns was that we were able to bring our two small dogs who were made to feel equally welcome! Fabulous standard throughout including lots of thoughtful touches in the room and everything fresh and clean. Fabulous!"
January 2022,"Beautiful Hotel, Wonderful people",The hotel is beautiful and everyone that works there is beyond friendly and extremely professional. Can't wait to stay there again!!! Breakfast was delicious and delivered super fast!  The bar in the lobby Donovans had a great atmosphere and delicious drinks.
January 2022,Brown's as excellent as ever !,"A big thank you for the team at Browns for providing exemplary service and hospitality as ever. We stayed for one night as part of my wife's birthday celebrations. They anticipated everything and ensured we were taken excellent care of. We have been fortunate enough to stay at the majority of London's top hotels, however it is Brown's to whom we return again and again. "
December 2021,Lovely place,"A lovely place all decorated for Christmas.Staff was lovely with the exception of one person in the dining room...appeared to seem to turn up his nose when I inquired if they served hamburgers and french fries..we arrived after a long day of travel and my 2 teen aged daughters wanted a lite lunch...we had been on the train, in the rain as well and were bundled up in jeans, caps, scarves and not dressed fine for lunch it must have seemed to him..my Husband did not appreciate the sneer so of course, we left and went out up the street to a corner pub and had delicious fish, chips, burgers and fries. The following morning, we went in for breakfast and the breakfast staff could not have been nicer. Our room was lovely, very squeaky floors, but a lovely suite, very nice sized‚Ä¶"
December 2021,A Fine Experience,"We were booked in by friends, intending to spend three days, (2 nights), together, unfortunately our stay and associated plans were curtailed as a result of the corona-virus. For the brief time that we stayed at Browns Hotel, we enjoyed absolutely first class service from arrival to departure and all points in between. The facility was excellent, the staff were friendly and professional and the food and beverages were well above average and good value. "
December 2021,The very best service,"We had an amazing stay at Brown's, which could have not been the case, considering we were travelling with two very young children - 22 months and 4 months! - and were perhaps being a little over ambitious. Luckily the incredibly warm and professional people working at Brown's saved the day!   Everyone was amazing, but special thanks goes to Theodora for enchanting our daughter, allowing her to walk her round exploring the hotel, and to Dominic who did the same at breakfast meaning we had a little free time to eat our breakfast! Thanks also to Lee for booking us an amazing restaurant on short notice and organising the science museum for a rainy saturday."
December 2021,"Great experience, great location, great stay","Highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for an impeccable, high quality, high standard of service hotel located in central London. The location is absolutely top notch with easy and rapid access to many of central London's best sites and attractions"
December 2021,Family Christmas,"Recently returned from a family Christmas and our first stop was Brown's Hotel in London. I have traveled extensively and normally stay in upscale hotels and this was the best ever! The hotel itself is beautiful, very British, and the restaurant and bar are wonderful. Great location in Mayfair with fine shopping and restaurants in walking distance. What made this hotel so outstanding was the staff. From the moment we arrived, and there were 9 of us, they treated us like royalty! The next morning they knew my grandkids, 16-20yrs, by their first names as well as ours. Truly, I have never had a hotel staff so fabulous! Our rooms were fabulous, we had upgraded for additional space, and my bathroom was great with plenty of space for me and a 16 yr. old teenage girl! I really could go‚Ä¶"
December 2021,Easy Luxury,One of the world's great hotels.  It was so easy to live luxuriously for a few days!  All of the staff; from the lady that cleaned our room to the hotel manager were attentive and friendly; sometimes too much so!
December 2021,Browns Visit 22.12.21,We had a magical trip to Browns and loved every moment of it. The food at Charlies was exceptional and the staff were delightful from arriving to departure. Thanks for a really wonderful memory. We will be back again soon I hope. 
December 2021,The finest hotel in the world,"A truly exceptional place.  The rooms are spacious, well-appointed, and extremely comfortable.  Charlie's (the hotel restaurant) is delicious.  For more importantly though, the staff makes the hotel.  I have never been treated with such kindness and courtesy (and I have traveled extensively for many years).  Each member of the staff -- clerical, housekeeping, food service, and concierge -- was individually excellent.  In combination, they were incomparable.  (Special mention should be made of Lee, Chris, David, and Marco in the concierge office.)  I truly believe this may well be the finest hotel in the world."
December 2021,Fabulous stay!,"We chose this hotel on a whim as Miss Marple (Agatha Christie) stayed here and, we had tea at Brown‚Äôs on our honeymoon 31 years ago.  Our stay was wonderful from check-in to check-out.  Everyone was kind, attentive, and considerate.  Our meals at the restaurant and our tea with our children and their partners were delicious and remarkable.  The beds are luxurious and the bathroom is simultaneously modern and classic.  Brown‚Äôs is a gem."
December 2021,Amazing hotel and staff,The room was beautiful and the staff very friendly and willing to help with anything. The doorman was always friendly and even advised when it was going to rain.  Breakfast was beautifully cooked and brought to our room. And the beds were just heaven.
December 2021,Classic London charm with touches of modern luxury,The perfect hotel for pre Christmas getaway. Perfect location and the hotel charm really makes your stay. Rooms don‚Äôt get any more generous and staff are always welcoming and helpful. Shout out to the Donovan bar staff who always stayed open late for my wife and I. Room was so quiet and comfortable while it felt as if you 
October 2021,Perfect afternoon tea,We had a delicious afternoon today and were looked after beautifully by the lovely staff. We didn't catch their names except for Bianca! The sandwiches were so tasty (and refilled quite a few times) and my husband was delighted with his plant based menu.  The hotel looked stunning with all the Christmas decorations. A really fabulous experience!
October 2021,Best High Tea in London,"While there are many high teas to choose from in London the only one worth going to is one presented by Yonka. Throughout the experience Yonka was excited to share her vast knowledge and expertise with us, which we especially appreciated since this was our first high tea. In addition to the excellent service provided by Yonka the Browns Hotel provided a variety of quality teas and unlimited food. This high tea experience was the absolute highlight of our trip to London."
October 2021,The best hotel in London,"Everything from the doormen, the Conciarge, to the staff in Charlie‚Äôs breakfast bar. They‚Äôre all incredible. They remember your names and your Childress names. They remember what breakfast you like. The rooms are a great size and the location is perfect for shopping and restaurants. We‚Äôve stayed their 3 times now and will continue to stay there when we visit London. Thank you browns for making our trips special."
October 2021,Afternoon Tea - perfection,Had the most wonderful time at Browns for Christmas afternoon tea. Family friendly and just first class service and food was amazing. Great value and Yonka couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. Superb in every way and my favourite afternoon tea. Covid secure. So festive with live entertainment. Thank you to everyone at Browns for making today so special ‚ô•Ô∏è and especially Yonka.
September 2021,Browns is elite,"Very good service, great food, very accomodating, doorman was excellent. It was everything we expected, wanted and so much more. Will stay there again and explore the other Rocco Forte hotels around the world."
October 2021,noise level of the room,The noise level of the room looking on the street was so noisy and you can hear all talk at night of the street even so I was on the fourth floor. You need to replace the window of the room or add another glass to prevent the noise.
October 2021,Afternoon tea in the Drawing Room at Brown's Hotel,"We spent a wonderful afternoon in the beautiful,  relaxed drawing room at Brown's Hotel - the occasion was my sister's birthday.  Our host, Yonka, was friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the flavours and origins of the ingredients of our food. The range of teas on offer is vast, and Yonka recommended varieties for us to try. She was generous with her time and very patient - a demanding job carried out effortlessly. The sandwiches and cakes were delicate, delicious and a pleasure to look at. We are so grateful to her and the other staff members, including the brilliant pianist providing memorable but familiar tunes, for making the afternoon so special."
October 2021,Bday in London!,"Amazing stay at the Brown's hotel! Early check-in available ( 9am) , Bday cake upon arrival and room upgrade! We had the best time ever in this beautiful hotel in the heart of London! I strongly recommend!"
October 2021,Our New London Residence.,"Stayed for a special birthday weekend for my wife. Overall a wonderful stay. Brown‚Äôs represents an exclusive, but low key Mayfair residence, where you were made to feel like old friends coming to stay. Nothing was too much trouble. You could spot the telltale Polizzi design in elegant touches to the interior & art works. Little extras such as fresh fruit in the room, beautifully plush slippers & a choice of turn down time make all the difference. A particular highlight was The Donovan Bar with it‚Äôs original, spectacular cocktails.  We were given a complementary upgrade to one of the suites, which was spectacular.  We can‚Äôt wait to book again."
October 2021,Brown's,"Fabulous high end hotel.  Rooms and public spaces very well done, super elegant.  The hotel is well located for all London activities and business. Will certainly return, especially if someone else is paying!"
September 2021,Great sleep,"Stayed here for one night and it was very comfortable and the sleep quality very good. All the staff were extremely friendly, helpful and courteous. My only ""complaint"" was that the bath was very slippery and there wasn't a mat to put in the bath to stop accidents - but that aside the room was very nice and comfortable, there was even a walk-in wardrobe."
October 2021,Wonderful High Tea,"We had a traditional and wonderful High tea at Brown‚Äôs Hotel thanks to Bianca and Karol.   they have been very helpful, smiling and professional.  They made one of my dream come true and I will cherish this moment for a long time. The food was delicious and we appreciated to have some more sandwiches . the place has not changed since the 80s and that‚Äôs what I wanted to feel. Thank you"
October 2021,A touch of class,"As a special treat (25th wedding anniversary) we visited Browns for afternoon tea. Yonka was our main waitress and she was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. To be honest all the front of house staff we meet were just lovely.   We started with rose champagne which was so good followed by a huge selection of wonderful tea's, a good selection of finger sandwich (the prawns ones were to die for) and delightful cream tea followed by cake we left a few pounds heavier than when we arrived. The live piano playing, quiet atmosphere made this a very special and memorable occasion.  I can't recommend Browns highly enough."
September 2021,Lovely afternoon,Visited today as a birthday gift. Attended the spa which was first class Followed by afternoon tea. Was so nice that you could have extra sandwiches as I don‚Äôt really have a sweet tooth. Staff were all so lovely and we were served mainly by Yonka who was so informative and attentive. Lovely ambiance very relaxing afternoon. Came away with a lovely box of cakes would highly recommend
September 2021,Concierge Extraordinaire,"Staying at Brown's hotel feels like coming home. The team of Concierge's; David, Leigh, Marco created an experience to remember. The teams suggestions, reservations, information and expert guides were at the highest level. One warm sunny day I was already in Hyde Park and they called to suggest a picnic hamper and delivered it to the edge of Hyde Park. The ability to secure reservations at the top restaurants, find a Royal Horticulturist to visit Kew Gardens and Savill gardens at Windsor made a memorable impression. The newest and oldest museum shows and small esoteric Handel to Hendrix museum were fantastic as well as a visit to Buckingham Palace gardens. The night manager Antonello, the front desk Francesca, everyone was so kind and helpful and fun. The experience they curate‚Ä¶"
September 2021,Rude Unfriendly staff . Poor service. Save ur money,My family visited for the overpriced afternoon tea. 50 per head without alcohol. The orange juice was one of the worst I‚Äôve had and had chunks of oranges inside which I nearly choked on. When I informed of this I was told ‚Äò it‚Äôs a freshly squeezed orange juice and it‚Äôs like that‚Äô like I‚Äôve never had an orange juice before ü§£ just accept the feedback the juice was crap and try improve it. We were made to cramp up on a tiny table despite there being other tables available and we did ask to move as other tables were available  however the staff was most unhelpful and arrogant and refused to accommodate. When the bill was presented despite us handing 2 prepaid vouchers for champagne we were charged for the same. When we pointed this out the arrogant staff pulling a face went and‚Ä¶
August 2021,Service not that great!,My friend and I attended for afternoon tea but unfortunately the service was not that great. The hostess was friendly but the fuss given was a little too over the top. She then asked my friend what Champagne she would like but forgot to ask me. My friends champagne was served and I was left with an empty glass. I then had to ask another member of staff for my Champagne. Its no big deal but when your paying ¬£150 for a few scones and stale sandwiches then am afraid it is. Our table was then left uncleared at the end and my box of cakes were then taken to another table its the small things that matter. Im afraid to say I was disapointed. I have had a few nice afternoon teas in london with professional switched in service but on this occassion at Browns Hotel was a big ‚Ä¶
September 2021,Afternoon Tea - Amazing,"I treated my sister to a belated Birthday afternoon tea and wanted something traditional with great service.  They did not let us down.  Ive forgotten the ladies name and the waiters but they were all out standing nothering too much trouble, made sure we had a great afternoon and even organised a cake for my sister and the piano playing happy Birthday.    Then when we asked at reception about the Graham Bell room the wonderful young man showed us the room and told us the history of the hotel.   if you want a great place for a wonderful trear then forget the Ritz and come here"
September 2021,Afternoon Tea,"A belated birthday trip for afternoon tea in the Drawing Room. The service was fantastic, very friendly, sandwiches delicious, cakes and scones so tasty. A great way to celebrate a special occasion. The interior is lovely with a pianist playing, the ambience was wonderful."
September 2021,"Wow, a true 5 star experience","We stayed at Browns for one night to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary and it was brilliant from start to end. We were made to feel welcome and special from the moment we arrived. Nothing was too much trouble, the little finishing touches were great. The doormen and concierge were always available to help and always have a smile. Our room was big, bright, sumptuously comfortable with a huge bed and was very quiet considering you're in Central London. Dinner at Charlie's was delicious, Paul was such a good host and is an asset to Browns. The extra touches given to us to help us celebrate our anniversary were thoughtful and very much appreciated.  The pianist was fantastic too. Safe to say, we will be back - well done Browns!"
August 2021,Afternoon Tea at the Drawing Room,"Gorgeous setting steeped in history.  The afternoon tea was probably a 4/5 but the prawn sandwich and carrot cake were 6/5, yummy! Best of all, ALL the staff were super knowledgable, friendly, accommodating and all round professional. Special shout out to Bianca.  Would highly recommend."
August 2021,Great Location At A Historic Stylish Hotel,"We‚Äôve stayed at other Rocco Forte hotels. The company chooses fabulous historic buildings and then does an amazing job in designing the interiors with unique style. Browns is a wonderful hotel and appeals to all the senses:  Food and drink - wonderful bar which was just renovated at the Donovan bar Delicious breakfast in a spectacularly decorated room (imagine Jungle book upscale) Charlie‚Äôs  Room- we requested quiet and it was beautifully appointed with extremely comfortable bed, lovely bedding and very quiet  The hotel had a subtle scent which was very pleasant. As far as service goes - the hotel manager was very professional and charming Check in was easy Concierges are some of the best in London. They arranged all the Covid tests and fantastic dinner recommendations as well‚Ä¶"
August 2021,Amazing time in this stylish hotel!,"We‚Äôve absolutely loved staying in the hotel! It‚Äôs beautiful, super stylish, clean and the staff very friendly and accommodating, from the reception to the restaurant and door man Givi- very friendly and helpful. Definitely recommend to anyone!"
August 2021,Best of British,"From the moment you are greeted, everything about Brown‚Äôs is the Best of British. Sophisticated, elegant and refined. I cannot speak highly enough about the service. Calm, friendly and efficient. Rooms are beautiful, food delicious and in my view, the best location in London."
August 2021,Baby friendly great visit,"We stayed with our 1 year old son and we were all made to feel most welcome! Whilst the chauffeured Bentley isn't available at the moment, the hotel is really well placed for parks and shopping. We were upgraded to a junior suite and the hotel provided a baby bath, cot, toys, baby products and much more. He loved it and we felt at home. We were also made welcome in the restaurant for our meals and the staff went out of their way to ensure our son was happy. Recommended for a luxury baby friendly holiday. Thank you to the hotel team!"
August 2021,Wonderful,"From the moment we arrived we were made welcome by the doorman, luggage taken straight to our beautiful, comfortable Junior suite.   The large room had every amenity and so quiet.  The front of house staff were exceptional.  They went out of their way to make our stay special.  It was an amazing experience.  Breakfast was perfect and the ambiance of the room made it relaxing with fresh flowers abundant throughout.  We cannot fault Brown's hotel."
August 2021,A five star home from home,"Many hotels claim to offer a home from home. Browns is the real thing - warm, personal and friendly from first contact to departure -   five star service and facilities as expected at this price, but without the aloofness which sometimes goes with. Room was generously sized, pleasantly decorated and very comfortable, with a huge bathroom. As an older woman travelling alone I was neither patronised nor made to feel out of place in the lively bar.  Lovely treatment in the small but perfectly formed spa.  Delicious food and an excellent choice of wine by the glass in Charlies restaurant. Special shout out to Joao in reservations, to Concierge Chris for dining out suggestions  and to the bar manager on Friday evening for their attentive service. I will definitely be back."
August 2021,Afternoon Tea,I went for an afternoon tea at Browns with friends. I have had afternoon tea here many times before this recent visit did not disappoint. Staff are very attentive without being obtrusive. Finger sandwiches are beautiful & fresh with a lovely range of fillings. We were offered additional sandwiches & couldn‚Äôt refuse! Scones were light & delicious with the jam & clotted cream. There was a really nice selection of cakes with two standouts- a vanilla & almond choux bun & a chocolate cherry tart. I wish I‚Äôd got the names of the staff that served us as they were both so lovely & helpful- nothing was too much trouble. Oh & you can try as many teas as you like to accompany your afternoon tea! Another wonderful experience at Browns to be repeated.
August 2021,Amazing experience,"We had an amazing experience with Angela M, she is such a lovely person and made our evening a pleasurable time. Totally recommend this place.  We loved the puddings and the atmosphere. Great place to eat and drink"
July 2021,Faultless,Faultless ! Every member of staff was exceptional and the service outstanding . The room had great power shower and separate bath . Perfect location in Mayfair . I will definitely be returning with hope of being able to use the spa facilities .
December 2020,"A wonderful experience of customer service which goes the extra mile, and staff who enabled us to have a wonderful stay","We were made to feel special from the moment we arrived at Brown‚Äôs Hotel, from the glass of champagne, to an upgraded room, to the concierge service arranging cars from the station and back from the show we saw. Nothing but as too much, impeccable service on every level. We felt cared for the entire time of our stay"
December 2020,"Tranquility, luxury, fine fare and personal service","An overnight stay to celebrate a ""big"" birthday. Could not have been a better memory! Made welcome from the moment of arrival to our departure. Upgrade room to a suite - decor discerning and calming. From afternoon tea, dinner in Charlies to a sumptious breakfast - absolutely first class cuisine and look forward to going back to Charlies. Can't recommend highly enough"
October 2020,Beautiful hotel with attentive service without being to ostentatious.,"Stayed at Browns for three nights and didn‚Äôt disappoint. A luxury hotel in the middle of Mayfair and it had everything you would expect from a hotel of this standing.  A special thank you to George, the doorman, who every morning was there to greet us and ensure we had everything in hand for the day.  We happen to bump into Stuart Johnson the managing director of the hotel in the lift who was friendly and welcome and interested in our experience of the hotel ."
November 2020,Midweek break,"A wonderful 5 star experience. It‚Äôs a beautiful hotel staffed by an excellent team who looked after us so well. Delicious breakfast, and wonderful cocktails in Donovan‚Äôs bar. We‚Äôll definitely be back."
October 2020,Never lets you down,"It isn't the cheapest hotel in London but it's certainly the best and you do really feel the benefit of paying a bit more. I have stayed several times, and across the Rocco Forte range, and the standards never slip even this time during the COVID pandemic. I travelled with my eldest daughter (15) for the weekend and we were both made to feel incredibly welcome and the small touches (which I won't embarrass everyone with here) just make you feel fantastic. Breakfast was excellent and just the right side of old-fashioned! I cannot recommend Browns enough for a special stay and to treat yourself to real, unfussy luxury. Special mention has to go to Dennis who was brilliant and really personifies everything that Browns is about. We'll almost certainly be back in 2021."
October 2020,Beyond Five Star,"Brown‚Äôs is intoxicating, meaning you want to return and return. This is something we did, and will continue to do. The welcome back was simply outstanding, genuine smiles abound from every member of staff. It‚Äôs the staff that make this place special, remembering you from previous visits and going out of their way to make your stay memorable. None of this is stuffy or fawning, it‚Äôs really quite effortless. All of the staff are worth their weight in gold. Dennis was an absolute star, looking after us from the moment we checked in, to the moment we left. It would be a struggle to find anyone offering service like this, in any hotel in London, he‚Äôs totally exemplary in every respect. Abigail, in Charlie‚Äôs, is also fantastic. She runs a very special restaurant and has a great knack‚Ä¶"
November 2019,Oasis in the heart of the West End,"After a long day touring the sights and shops in the plushest parts of the West End, we popped in to Brown‚Äôs Hotel to take some well-earned refreshment. There we discovered an amazing and chic oasis - also known as the Donovan Bar.  We were tempted by the friendly staff into sampling their superb cocktails, the Archie I chose being the best whisky cocktail I have ever sampled. Service was excellent and atmosphere was better still. I thoroughly recommend taking time-out from a serious shopping trip there."
October 2020,E Stanworth,2 day break over Friday and Saturday with my teenage daughter.  Enjoyed the location which is central to all the great shops.  Room 216 was comfortable and a good size (junior suite) but no view. Reception staff and doorman deserve a particular mention for friendly and helpful behaviour.  Browns was better than my last couple of stays at The Langham.
October 2020,Fantastic Stay!,"This is our first time to stay in this wonderful hotel, from the time we checked in until we checked out all the staff are amazing! We had an afternoon tea as well in the Drawing room which I highly reccommend if anyone wants to experience this exquisite experience. Our room was spacious clean and comfy , my daughter even had her own bed with Alby on it with the princess activity pack , and her own cute slippers she was so elated. From Dennis who was always welcoming and I can assure all will always have a smile on his face behind the mask, to the lady who assists us at breakfast in Charlies, the gentleman who explained every detail during our afternoon tea, our warmfelt thank you for making our stay a memorable one. We will come back to stay again or even have lunch or dinner‚Ä¶"
October 2020,One night of luxury,"The staff were friendly and courteous, and I enjoyed every minute of my 24 hours there. I would highly recommend it, and am already looking forward to my next trip. It is five star in every sense of the word."
October 2020,Excellent service - hope to return,"I was lucky enough to come and enjoy cocktails in the bar at Browns whilst catching up with a girlfriend. From walking through the door the service was impeccable, the staff were extremely welcoming, friendly and attentive. The decor is beautiful and a lovely and vibrant atmosphere without being too loud. Cocktails were delicious and a great variety and choice. I can‚Äôt wait to return."
September 2020,Browns Hotel,Wonderful stay - five stars for food and hospitality. The hotel was clean and safe. London is quiet and so was the hotel. This made it so much fun - streets were empty galleries easy to get into. A perfect break.
September 2020,Fantastic Stay,"What can I say but WOW, this hotel is just amazing: the decor, the staff, the room. Cleaning in this hotel is impeccable, attention to detail everywhere, so clean, I felt very safe staying there during this COVID outbreak, cleaning staff knocked to see if there anything you needed or could get if you ran out of toiletries, the housekeeping staff were truly wonderful and looked after our every need  The room was amazing with attention to detail to provide a clean and beautiful room stay in and the Irene Forte toiletries are amazing and smell lovely, staff made you feel important and greeted everyone with a smile.  Afternoon tea was enjoyed on the first day, the food was scrumptious, and the service was elegant, warm and friendly. Karol and David were amazing!  The front desk‚Ä¶"
September 2020,Beautiful hotel stay,"Spacious rooms with a soft, relaxing colour scheme in this very historic, elegant Georgian townhouses of which 11 makes up the Brown's Hotel (previously two hotels, St George's, Albemarle Street, and Brown's, Dover Street, they kept expanding then became one as they backed on to each other) with upscale marble/limestone bathrooms, and luxurious chaise longues.  I absolutely loved my staycation at Browns Hotel, Mayfair.  It is the oldest hotel in London, being the first hotel in London,and I think it is also the prettiest üòç   It's like walking into a beautiful English garden with the large florals and wisteria flowing down the walls.   Located in the heart of Mayfair it has welcomed royalty (Queen Victoria, and Queen Elizabeth as a princess), politicians (Roosevelt), writers‚Ä¶"
March 2020,5 Stars are not enough,"We have just returned from another memorable stay at this amazing hotel. During these difficult times we had to postpone my 50th birthday celebrations which, we were due to celebrate at Browns in March. Six months on, Browns made this special birthday one I will never forget. The staff were so attentive, always had time to stop and talk and wanted to make our time at Browns special. All government guidelines on Covid-19 were adhered to however this did not take anything away from making our stay comfortable and amazing. During these unprecedented times, managing to operate within the guidelines and still give the customer that special feeling, may seem impossible, but Browns have managed it and in our opinion exceeded it! I can not thank the management and staff enough for‚Ä¶"
May 2019,"Beautiful surroundings, outstanding service","I visited the Drawing Room at Brown‚Äôs recently for Afternoon Tea with a small group of colleagues. The wood-panelled room is as charming as ever and the traditional afternoon tea is immaculately done - starched linen table cloth and napkins, delicate china and a delicious array of finger sandwiches and pastries as well as scones of course. The waiters are only too happy to bring you more of the food if you would like as well as a fresh pot of tea. And all accompanied by a live pianist. A real oasis of calm and grace in these troubled times. Special thanks to our terrific head waiter Karol and to the super friendly and helpful receptionist Luca. Can‚Äôt wait to go back!"
April 2020,Browns in St James‚Äô,Chose this hotel as very centrally situated and close to New Bond Street for shopping and the Ritz for dinner. Super welcome by George and then at the desk by TeO. Marco was very good also as was the pleasant Sicilian waitress in Donovan‚Äôs bar. We had asked for a quiet room and that was what we were given. Everything was there in the room and the bed was exceptionally comfortable. Very good turndown service. Bumped into Sir Rocco Forte and he said hello.  All in all one of the best London hotels that we have visited. Will go again.
May 2019,Afternoon tea,Wow just wow!!!. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left we felt special. So let's get down to our tea. A great selection of finger sandwiches. They even did cucumber and coconut butter sandwiches for me as I can't eat cheese. Every one of the sandwiches so tasty. As for the selection of cakes and scones mouth watering. You must have their home made strawberry jam. More of a taste of fruit than sugar. We both liked our tea I had the Cornish and TOH had the Browns afternoon blend. They even made TOH a little chocolate mouse cake for a birthday treat. Not sure of our waiter and waitress names were but thanks very much. I just hope the photo's do the food justice.
December 2019,Luxury & Service,"From the moment the doorman opened our taxi door we were treated as if we were the most important people in the world. Stunning building, beautifully decorated and well appointed. We were given an upgraded room upon check-in so had the most fabulous suite which was stunning as was the bathroom and the comfort of the bed was off the charts. Browns is part of the Rocco Forte hotel group and you can NEVER go wrong with them. For us a slice of decadent luxury is needed to refuel the soul and the Browns hotel did just that. Thank you"
March 2020,Everything is Perfect! ,"It's such a lovely boutique hotel in the heart of Mayfair. The vibe was great, the staffs were friendly helpful, the room was spacious and super comfy. Overall, the hotel quality was superb! We'll definitely come back when we visit London again and will recommend this to our relatives and friends. Keep up the good work!  I still remember every detail in our deluxe room. "
January 2020,Everything was superb ,"Stayed at the Brown's Hotel a few years back. Loved it. One of the oldest hotels in London, the service is very good. The location is super convenient and the service is super comfortable, just across the street from old Bond street. Good breakfast, I don't remember how much, very touristy, don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs a good thing or a bad thing, The only downside is that the hotel rooms."
January 2020,Just outstanding ,"The hotel is very  historic, quiet and elegant The location is great for London visits and getting in and out of the city. We were truly amazed by the impeccable service there. Very spacious and stylish rooms. Would recommend for sure! "
January 2020,Wonderful sTaff,Staff were amazing with my little trip to visit this hotel a number of weeks ago. the attention to detail was outstanding! Made me feel very special.  Nothing was too much and i will be returning again in the near future.
January 2020,got here just in time!,I stayed at Brown's for the few days before London and the rest of the world shut down. They could not have been nicer. Staff was helpful and proactive with the needs of someone who had to leave very quickly.
December 2019,Exquisite ,"A beautiful hotel, stylishly appointed with discreet, efficient and friendly service. Situated in the heart of Mayfair with shopping, theatre and restaurants all within easy walking distance. The hotel‚Äôs Donovan bar is fun and lively and a great place to meet friends and enjoy their delicious cocktails. Highly recommended."
January 2020,A very special birthday,I  arrived at Brown's feeling quite stressed and within  minutes could  feel  myself relaxing The  lunch was excellent The service was  everything you could want The afternoon tea was  brilliant The treatment in the spa very  very  relaxing The Suite was lovely
January 2020,Exemplary Customer Service,"I found out last minute that a friend of mine was staying at the Brown's over their birthday. So in the middle of the night I reached out to see if they could organize a last minute in-room birthday celebration.  Despite the inappropriate hour for the request, Dennis and his team happily went to work orchestrating a beautiful birthday surprise, complete with themed balloons, a hand written card, pastries, and champagne to mark the occasion. It was truly better than what I could have pieced together. My friend was surprised and elated by the gesture, and more so impressed that Dennis and his team were able to pull it off at zero hour.   This hotel absolutely has earned their five star merit! I will continue to highly recommend to anyone traveling to London."
January 2020,Facial treatment at The Spa at Brown‚Äôs Hotel,"I booked myself for a Irene Forte 60 minutes facial. What a wonderful experience - my therapist Karmini has fantastic hands. I arrived at the spa after a busy stressful day, tired and with my mind still working 1000 thoughts per minute. 10 minutes into the facial, I felt so relaxed, and with my mind only focusing on Karmini‚Äôs hands and techniques. As the facial progressed, I found myself dozing off into a deep, soothing sleep.  The products smell amazing, and the facial massage was done so rhythmical, so soothing, that it completely made me forget about the stress and worries of work. My skin was cleansed, exfoliated, massaged and moisturised, and it had a healthy glow at the end of the treatment.  If you wish to visit this spa for a treatment, do ask for Karmini! "
December 2019,Incredible Experience,"With previous experience staying at Rocco Forte's Hotel de Russie in Rome, the Brown's Hotel did not disappoint. The rooms were spacious and the staff were nothing but friendly. The concierge helped my family and I to acquire tickets to shows that we thought were sold out for that week, which was much appreciated. The hotel itself is quaint, which makes it all the more lovely. The bar downstairs, Donovan's, is also a great place to have a drink before dinner or to just enjoy a cappuccino. When we return to London for another trip, we will definitely be staying at Brown's again."
December 2019,Excellent dinner.,"Many thanks for another amazing evening at Browns.  The food was delicious and the service efficient and friendly without being intrusive.  None of that gastly ""Everything to your liking sir?"".    Well done Browns."
December 2019,The incredible afternoon tea at Browns,"A wonderful lady called Yonka served us the most incredible afternoon tea at Brown‚Äôs Hotel on Friday the 18th of January. The staff were incredibly welcoming and the attention to detail that you receive  on the various teas on offer is astounding! The Michelin star chef‚Äôs selection of sandwiches and treats were first class. Home-made strawberry jam served with the fluffiest scones, the new Tea Tox Selection of healthy treats is also fantastic. The most amazing vegetable curry treat with onion bhaji set on top is delicious. The most amazing humous and beetroot treat was sensational as was a wonderful take on a ploughman‚Äôs  sandwich mixed with a Waldorf salad.  All sublime. My weakness was the carrot cake which I have rarely tasted better. The best thing about the afternoon tea‚Ä¶"
December 2019,One Night Grand,"Once again Brown‚Äôs never fails to please. Still one of my favourite hotels in the world. Always beautiful and elegant. Rooms are always immaculate, staff ever helpful and food a delight. It really is the best location in central London. This trip we went to the theatre but sometimes I would stay there as so close to all the top stores with the best shopping. Missed John the door man this time. My son is 16 now and probably too old for the gold chocolate coins anyhow!! Thanks for the upgrade Brown‚Äôs! "
November 2019,Amazing luxury : Unforgettable experience,"I spent a few days in London with my aunt and stayed at Brown's hotel. I completely felt in love with this hotel, everything was amazing: beautiful room, wonderful setting and atmosphere, the staff were friendly, helpful and courteous. It was so welcome from the time we arrived to the time we left. It was my first trip to London and it could't have gone better thanks to Brown's Hotel and Rocco Forte Company! If you want to make your trip to London unforgettable this is the place where you have to go!   See you soon"
September 2019,Outstanding Brown‚Äôs!,"We spent 3 days in London staying at the Brown‚Äôs. We had a remarkable dinner at Charlie‚Äôs and we enjoyed an unforgettable British afternoon Tea in The Drawing Room at Brown‚Äôs. Above all our expectations is the staff: discrete, kind, welcoming, professional. Our daughter was entertained with an adorable treasure hunt, lovely books and gadgets. She really enjoyed moving around with confidence under the discrete surveillance of the staff. Every detail in the hotel is very well thought of. There is nothing that I can think of that was not top level, including service and cleaning. Indeed, we truly appreciated the elegant and magic atmosphere at Brown‚Äôs! We definitely look forward to visiting again!!"
December 2019,Fabulous hotel in the heart of Mayfair! ,We stayed at this hotel over a weekend.   The first thing that struck me was the interior of the hotel. The reception was painted with the most amazing patterns and colours. It made the hotel seem very luxurious as soon as we entered. After we checked in their was stolen mince pies and mulled wine which was delicious.   Mayfair at this time of the year is beautiful as all the shops are very Christmassy.  Our room was very spacious and had a lovely bathroom and plenty of storage.  The breakfast was amazing as well and I had an omelette which was very tasty.
December 2019,Very welcoming. Attentive staff,"Very comfortable bedroom. Impressed with the attentive staff and no request too much trouble. Excellent location and central for shopping etc. We have stayed in a few of the ""better"" hotels in London but Browns overall is top of the list."
October 2019,like at home,"the position is fantastic, you can go everywhere in few minutes the reception is warm, with a chimney, like at home the bar and the restaurant were very cool all people in reception and the waiters were very kind"
November 2019,Beyond excellence ,"A huge thank you to Dennis and the team at Browns for creating a truly unforgettable stay for my wife and I on our wedding night. They all went above and beyond in both preparation and execution, the room was beyond fabulous and the addition of a few special extras for our big day were absolutely exceptional. We‚Äôd love to do it all over again and look forward to our return visit!   Furthermore, it was a real pleasure and a surprise to go back and visit Browns again recently, and Dennis and the team came through 10/10 again! Outstanding.   I honestly could not recommend this team enough. "
December 2019,Amazing Spa,I booked the the littles ones spa treatment for my daughters birthday. Her and best friend had an amazing time due to services. I have never come across such great staff and very professional. Definitely will be going back
November 2019,Extremely poor nights sleep,"Booked a double room, to find 2 single beds pushed together! This does not constitute as a double bed. We called down to have the room made up to a double bed, which they said they would do. On returning after our evening out, the room had NOT been made up but felt it was too late to call down again. My husband fell out of bed during the night.  We complained in the morning about the room and were offered a 10% discount, which we found quite insulting when the room charged was ¬£705.00 per night. This was our first stay and definitely our last.  On the plus side, the door staff were so welcoming and friendly."
December 2019,English Tearoom,"My husband and I enjoyed an afternoon tea here. The food and champagne were delicious and there was an amazing range of teas to choose from. The staff were attentive and helpful, and also discreet. The surroundings are elegant and peaceful, away from the bustle of the city. An added enjoyment was a pianist playing quietly in the background. Absolutely recommended for a special treat."
December 2019,Very Great location in London,"The Brown‚Äòs Hotel is a very great location in London. Fine service, wonderful food and drinks and absolutely friendly. Many thanks to Sophie Bayly Jones, Claus Banczyk and Antonio from the best breakfast in town. Door men and Concierge absolutely friendly. The Brown‚Äôs Hotel is the best hotel in class. Thank‚Äòs Sir Rocco Forte and team."
December 2019,Fantastic stay!,"WE just had the most incredible stay at Brown's hotel in London.  Very well located and the service is second to none. It was my husband's 50th Birthday, and the hotel concierge, Dennis, helped me organize a cake (with photos of my husband on it!) and balloons for the room, when we arrived! Just all around fabulous stay, beautiful old hotel that felt like home, and incredible staff who greeted us by name, each day when we had breakfast at Charlie's or just opened the door as we left or returned. I highly recommend and will stay here again!"
November 2019,Drinks,Popped in here for a drink after shopping at Tiffany‚Äôs. Absolutely thrilled that they are dog friendly. I enjoyed a fine glass of red Merlot. My dog Benji was offered some water too. Fabulous Christmas decorations.  Friendly staff. 
November 2019,Overall a pleasant stay,"The hotel is for sure one of the best in London. I do not particularly like the rather narrow, albeit pleasantly retro entrance from Albemarle Street as I do not find the Reception particularly comfortable and easy to access given the (three) steps you have to walk down to reach it. The fact that you have noone to help you with your luggage makes the check-in even more uncomfortable. Maybe we were not particularly lucky or... welcome - although we are a very decent couple travelling very frequently and staying in 5+ star hotels all the times, so I believe we are used to comfort and I can guarantee that we are always welcome. Never mind. Rooms and floor service (turn-down, floor management etc.) impeccable: 10/10. Decor of room, floor corridors as well as bar and dining areas‚Ä¶"
November 2019,Memorable High Tea,"Many thanks to Yonka, Zoltan and David for going the extra mile.  Their fine service and wonderful food made for a very special experience. Will make high tea at Browns a must -do whenever I visit London."
December 2019,Mac Family Lo don Visit,Great location slightly pricey compared to other standard hotels but the service was great and rooms are of a high standard.  Door men and Concierge are best in class.  Will stay here again if any offers are shared by Browns Hotel.  
December 2019,Another fan of Afternoon Tea at Brown's,"Wife and I enjoyed the Tea on her birthday.  Yonka was a pure pleasure, with an able assist from Aisha (sp?).  The pianist was wonderful and the food, of course, perfect.  We went for a 12:30 sitting on a Wednesday and nearly had the place to ourselves.  Only ate there, so cannot comment on the hotel itself."
December 2019,Noisy and poor service,"poor service, incredibly noisy during the nights because there is a nightclub just opposite.empty breakfast-buffet, very slooooow service. the hotel lives of it's location i guess! definetly not worth the money."
December 2019,Big hotel with boutique hotel charm and service!!,"My wife and I spent 3 nights at Brown's in November and we loved it!!! Location was great. The vibe in the hotel was awesome and different in each restaurant and room in the hotel. The hotel staff were so friendly and helpful especially the concierges that helped us while we were there. From opening doors to you to remembering your name each time you returned to the property, Brown's makes you really feel like you are at home. Our room was massive!! It was so nice, clean and everything else that you would want in a hotel room. The bathroom was large and the shower even had a whole door so the bathroom did not get soaked every time you showered!!! The breakfast buffet was perfect and the food was all very good. The bar off the lobby was so cool and the drink menu is off the hook.‚Ä¶"
November 2019,The Perfect Afternoon Tea,"Recently enjoyed afternoon tea with Yonka as our server.  She was knowledgeable about the tea menu and provided us with details about each item on the delicious menu.  Atmosphere, as always, was perfect. "
November 2019,Pre Christmas afternoon tea,"A thoroughly enjoyable place to while away a couple of hours on a Monday afternoon, Brown‚Äôs has been a favourite of ours for several years.  Today, we were served attentively by the lovely Yonka, who was efficient and very friendly, explaining with great enthusiasm each of the elements of our afternoon tea. We‚Äôll be back at some point in the near future!"
November 2019,Mr Emanuele Esposito,"I had an amazing time in the tea room, a very warm welcome from Askay and Csilla than following the great opening table with the knowledge of Lorenzo about the teas and Yonka about the sandwiches and sweets and thanks to Zoltan very kind person and  a big thanks to David for looking after us in a pretty much way! I would raccomand to the whole world ! Thanks guys"
June 2019,Tea for Two,We had heard quite a bit about having tea at Brown‚Äôs Hotel while visiting London but think it was a bit over rated.  I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a great place to take granny but doesn‚Äôt have an environment that anyone under 60 would find fun.
November 2019,Afternoon tea on high level!,"This is a nice charming hotel in the center of London, very English from the beginning to the end - and we loved it!   Excellent service, nice atmosphere, lovely sandwiches, cakes and scones and not to forget - their strawberry jam. Homemade - delicious.   We were served by Yonka and David the 25th of November. They both made sure we had everything we needed and you would think this is a snobby hotel? You are so wrong. All stuff were very friendly and everyone we spoke with made sure we got the best service.  Congratulations to the Hotel Manager - you have hire some really nice and loyal people. Good job!"
November 2019,Lunch at Charlie‚Äôs Saturday 30th Nov.,"What a great restaurant in the hotel. They did us proud with the quality of food and wine. The service was exceptional. I thought the Terrine of partridge & pear was superb. The fillet of beef succulent. I would like to thank Stuart , John and the whole team for there efforts."
November 2019,Afternoon tea with my daughter,"We visited Browns for afternoon tea after a shopping day in London. The team was great and attentive from start to finish. Thank you Karol,Csilla and David, we will be back when we are in London again."
November 2019,outdated decor in room.,"The best shower pressure in any hotel room we have ever stayed in.  The decor in the room was very outdated,and the step down from the bathroom to the hall and from the hall to the bedroom was quite dangerous. Misstepped several times. Wonderful location and staff were very accommodating. BUT the HIGHLIGHT of our trip to the Brown Hotel was meeting SIMONE, a summer intern. He attended our every need; he was kind and friendly. He attends an elite school for hotel management and will one day be in charge of a very fine hotel. HE WAS THE BEST!!!!!!!! Thank you, Simone!"
October 2019,Browns london,The best Home away from home. Best small hotel with impeccable service and attention to all your needs. Right in the heart of Mayfair so location perfect. Afternoon tea should not be missed but book ahead. 
November 2019,Beautiful and luxurious property,"Our stay at the Brown's Hotel exceeded our expectations. The property is absolutely gorgeous and we were so impressed with how spacious the rooms were. The front desk and concierge staff were delightful. The bar was stunning and a great place to grab a drink. We sadly had to leave early due to some flight changes, otherwise we'd have loved to try the tea room as well as breakfast, as both looked incredible when we were checking in. We also didn't get to take advantage of the great location, but it really is ideally located."
August 2019,Fabulous Lunch,"My friend and I have visited Charlie's restaurant twice now and have been so impressed by the decor, comfort, staff and food.  The food was delicious on both occasions and we were never rushed.  The girl that served us the first time (Ludmila), was so lovely and nothing was too much.  She recognized us the second time we went and came straight over to welcome us.  All the staff, including the doormen, are so attentive and happy, they really make you feel at home. This place has now become our favourite and we will be going back to stay at the hotel and also have afternoon tea which I've heard is the best. What a fantastic place.....I really can't wait to go back!!"
September 2019,Afternoon Tea,"We were lucky enough to be invited for the afternoon tea by our dear friend. We could not have enjoyed ourselves more, the food was delicious and the restaurant stylish yet relaxed and warm. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Special thanks to Zoltan for his generosity and kindness. Looking forward to coming back!"
September 2019,Brown's Hotel is the best!,"We come to London a lot, and always stay at Browns.  They treat us with warmth and kindness the moment we arrive to the time we leave.  Everyone greets us and helps with any requests with such care.  We will be back again next month.  "
September 2019,Mrs Drew,"Had a fabulous meal at Charlie's restaurant last night. Very good space offering privacy between tables, lovely decor and ambience. Not too large a menu to choose from, excellent wine selection. The terrine and English rose veal both delicious, sadly no space to try the puddings... next time ."
September 2019,Lovely drink at the Browns,"My business partner visited me in London and choose the browns hotel. Is 6 years that I live in London and I never been there before and as been a lovely surprise. Dennis at the front desk helped me to get up to my business partner room and organised for our client and us a wonderful table at the bar. Rooms are quite big considering London standards and also really quite. Drinks at the bar where absolutely perfect, my extra dry martini was perfectly done and the service was perfect. By the end of the evening Dennis also helped me to pay all the bills and arrange taxi for my clients and myself.   Absolutely an outstanding customer service!!!"
September 2019,wonderful experience,"A wonderful hotel in a great location. Our suite was everything we could hope for. We were here for our honeymoon, and were definately treated as such. The staff is exceptional. Greatly looking forward to returning."
April 2019,Brown's High Tea,"We attended Brown's Hotel for their High Tea as we always do when in London. The standard of the tea was as high as ever and Lorenzo, our waiter, was attentive and charming. He is a credit to the Hotel. We recommend this as a must-do when visiting London."
August 2019,Fantastic small (medium) luxury hotel,Located in an area with some of the best restaurants shops and business facilities while at the same time is unique in the services rendered. It‚Äôs breakfast is memorable while it‚Äôs Donovan bar is the best place to end your day. 
August 2019,Best Afternoon Tea in London and most charming hotel. Superb service,"I absolutely love this place. The service, atmosphere and style is perfect. Always a charm visiting, and to the fingertips professional but with personality. Thanks to Lorenzo for perfect service.  Also nice to go over to stylish Donovan Bar after the Afternoon Tea for excellent drinks."
September 2019,Special celebration in Brown's Hotel,"All aspects of our stay were perfect - the room, dining in the restaurant now overseen by Adam Byatt, breakfast and service throughout.  A memorable 5-star experience for a special occasion.  And for those not visiting Brown's for a good while, the new restaurant layout/refurbishment and, more recently, the combined reception/concierge areas work so much better than before."
March 2019,Average customer service,Overall an average experience. Got bumped to a junior suite but the room was dark and was denied changing rooms although I requested a downgrade if I can get some light in the room. The manager at the desk was rude and so was the gate keeper condescending. The saving grace is the Donovan bar where they have excellent staff. They should have kept up with the history of the hotel as many staff didn't know what the hotel stood for and it took them a while to print me something on the history of the hotel. Mixed signals overall hence the review. Make sure your card doesn't decline by mistake. They will devour you with their looks.
July 2019,Afternoon Tea Abounds!,"I can‚Äôt even begin to express how wonderful our afternoon was! Manager Alexander Wilson happened to greet us as we entered, and he made the experience all the better with superb attention to detail! The staff was fantastic in service and supply of the amazing sandwiches and fabulous desserts! Alexander remembered our names and checked back in with us several times to make sure we had everything we needed. He gave us a fabulous tour of the property, and answered all of my many questions. I will recommend to any who asks (and those who don‚Äôt!) to have tea and stay at the exquisite Brown‚Äôs Hotel! Bravo to all of the staff! Thank you for being a highlight of my time in London! Will be back for sure!"
June 2019,Afternoon Tea Delight,"We had another enjoyable experience at Browns having afternoon tea for 3 persons. We were seated early and welcomed by Yonka and David, who were both pleasant and professional. Yonka had extensive knowledge on the tea and helped us make excellent choices. The customer service was exceptional and the quality and choice of teas and food superb. The surroundings are elegant and sophisticated and there is a very quaint atmosphere, unlike the vast restaurant areas in other hotels this gives a very comfortable feeling of being in a private dining room. We enjoy the pianist as a background to the event and we will definitely return. Winston Churchill used to frequent Browns and I believe is reputed to have said ‚Äú there are 5 star hotels in London and then, there is Browns..‚Äù."
June 2019,Perfect Hotel,"Classic grand deluxe hotel service in London‚Äôs best location, east to walk to shops, galleries and restaurants. Professional management has raised the bar in service quality, great bar with famous bartender, traditional English restaurant with freshest ingredients. Luncheon silver trolley. Feels like a townhouse with multiple entrances, beautiful stairs to walk up and down as an alternative to the lifts. Great concierge team to make things happen."
June 2019,Best afternoon tea in London!,"I had read in various sources that afternoon tea (please do NOT call it high tea since that is something else entirely!) at Brown's is the best in London.  I decided to try it out in March of 2019 and I was not disappoint.  The selection of sandwiches, pastries, scones, and teas was superb.  The tearoom made me feel that I was in an exclusive English club.  As for the service, it could not have been better.  My special thanks to Yonka, Karol, and the other staff for making tea at Brown's so memorable and enjoyable.  I will add that i was accompanied by my godson who is dairy intolerant.  With advance notice the chef went out of his way to prepare a tea that my godson could enjoy.  I've since returned to Brown's twice more and look forward to my fourth afternoon tea later this‚Ä¶"
November 2018,"Elegant hotel, great service & best Martini! ","I celebrated my birthday with my husband, son and a friend.  Andrea in the bar was perfect, gracious hostess, and very pleasant.  Atmosphere was elevated by the live music in the bar.  Restaurant was buzzing, great service by Fl√°vio, who was very knowledgeable and made some great food suggestions and Justina, who was lovely and very welcoming with genuine smile.   Highly recommend!  "
June 2019,Beautiful Brown‚Äôs,"My husband and I stayed at the Brown‚Äôs Hotel for 2 glorious nights. Upon arrival the room was not ready, but we were shown to the bar and were served tea. We were eventually upgraded to a gorgeous suite. No argument here. The staff were extremely professional.  We enjoyed the fantastic afternoon tea and Yonka made our experience extra special for us with amazing service e including taking photos for us.  The Brown‚Äôs will be our next hub in London. Thank you "
June 2019,Best High Tea Ever!,Fantastic birthday celebration High Tea at Browns Hotel! This is at least my 4th visit and by far the best. Thanks to Yonka and Zoltan for taking such good care of us!! This even beats seeing Pierce Brosnan having tea 20+ years ago!
June 2019,Tea at Brown‚Äôs Hotel London,"My family and I just had afternoon tea at the Brown‚Äôs Hotel London. Yonka and Zoltan were our hosts. They were amazing and enhanced the already marvelous experience with charm and elegant consideration. Our family included children and they were tended to like special guests, with Peruvian Hot Chocolate and endless macaroons. The adults were treated to a glass of fine champagne. We all enjoyed dining on the savory sandwiches which were refined yet filling. The sweets were delicate and delicious. The fresh Strawberry Jam, ‚Äúperfectly balanced,‚Äù as Yonka described, was a favorite. Zoltan gave us a taste of the strawberry macaroon, a day early, designed for Wimbledon week. Afternoon Tea at the Brown‚Äôs was highlight of our trip to London."
June 2019,Almost perfect,"Must say Brown's hotel it is a very nice place with a lovely atmosphere and outstanding service. The restaurant is amazing , as well as the English tea room. Loved them.   In room dining very nice, must say the manager is a complete incompetent and unprofessional person. I think my five years old son would manage situations better than him.  For the rest I have to say I had a wonderful experience"
June 2019,Very enjoyable break,"My wife and I stayed at Brown‚Äôs for our wedding anniversary and we ate at Beck at Brown‚Äôs. My father had recommended it as he used to always stay when in London on business.   We found the staff very welcoming and the room was superb (they did upgrade us though). The dinner in Beck was really good, although rather pricey, the quality of the food was absolutely top class. We met some friends for dinner who are Italian, one of whom is a really good chef, and they were also really impressed.   Overall we had a fabulous experience and would highly recommend this place. I can see why my Dad liked it so much. My wife and I wouldn‚Äôt normally stay somewhere quite so high end but on this occasion it was well worth it. I‚Äôm not a person who gives reviews normally but thought this was worth‚Ä¶"
June 2019,"Just like home, but better","Our family had a wonderful holiday at the Brown's Hotel in London. The location in Mayfair was perfect. The staff was professional and knowledgeable.   The hotel atmosphere and design of the rooms were divine. The attention to detail was appreciated. The concierge David Young went above and beyond for us. He was so patient and attentive while we were changing plans during the day due to weather and some traffic. He did everything he could to help us pack in as much to our day as possible, keeping us on time and on track from the spa to last minute tickets to a show on our last night!   The staff at the restaurant for our daily breakfast were all friendly and attentive as well.  Made us feel like royalty!  Dominic and Alexi remembered our favorite orders and took excellent care‚Ä¶"
June 2019,Best Hotel Ever?,"Probably! This hotel easily earns every one of its 5 stars.  First time in London with children, ages 10-15, & everything was perfect.  Luxurious but not stuffy. Attentive but not fussy. Outstanding complimentary breakfast. Entire hotel staff was incredibly friendly & helpful. Concierges Paul, Peter, & David were exceptional. Luggage porters Givi & Matt took care of everything at departure & made sure we didn‚Äôt forget anything."
June 2019,Superb room and service ,"I had an exceptional stay at Brown‚Äôs for a short 3 day trip.  The room is very nice with a comfortable bed, desk, and plug points everywhere convenient and a large bathroom with separate tub and shower.  The highlight for Browns however is the service at the hotel with everyone very helpful.  Would definitely stay again and the location in Mayfair can‚Äôt be beat for business, shopping or dining  "
June 2019,Afternoon Tea,"We had a fabulous experience at afternoon tea when visiting London. Yonka went above and beyond to make sure that we had a great time, from helping us find the right champagne to excellent service. The tea was traditional but with innovative details, and it was an overall lovely and relaxing experience with great atmosphere."
June 2019,Magnificent Browns,"Browns Hotel is ideally located . It is a brilliantly run hotel where all departments of staff are helpful polite and seem proud to be working there , you get the personalized treatment, don‚Äôt look further you won‚Äôt find better anywhere. My favorite city hotel in the world still after 43 years of business and holiday travel "
June 2019,English tea at Brown's Hotel,"Can't think of a better experience than the one Yonka and Zoltan provided for my friend and I as we had afternoon tea. The food was gorgeous and delivered with care, the live piano music created a calm atmosphere, and the service was personal but not over-bearing. Before we went, we wondered what we would do for two hours at tea, but the leisurely yet attentive pace of service and the beauty of the environment lent itself to conversation and enjoyment."
May 2019,Fabulous Hotel,This is a top rate hotel in a lovely part of London. The staff are incredibly kind and helpful and the accommodations are first rate! The restaurant is wonderful and the bar for late night drinks or afternoon tea is terrific.  
May 2019,Wonderful Afternoon Tea,"My friend and I returned to Brown's on the 08/06/2019 for Afternoon Tea. We had really wonderful experience (as usual), Yonka and Karol were attentive and highly professional. Brown's is a must do! And, I will be back!"
May 2019,"Great Location, Wonderful Service","The Brown's Hotel is in the perfect location in London and has so many unique benefits.  The House Bentley car was such a fun touch and we loved our dinner at Beck's.    The kid's amenities were some of the best I've seen-- personalized sheets, books, stuffed animals, bath products and even a child umbrella in the closet.  My daughter was definitely in heaven!"
August 2018,Making memories.. superb,"I brought my 11 Grand daughter for afternoon tea at the English Tea room as part of her weekend away in London. What a wonderful experience firstly by being greeted so warmly as we exited our cab at the door by your amazing commisionair to the superb service, delicious sandwiches and cakes and pastries and finally to the birthday acknowledgement for Gracie's birthday with a little cake,candle and happy birthday sung.  Thank you Brown's Hotel you are the most wonderful of hotels,with an amazing team."
January 2019,Exceptional in every eay,"Brown‚Äôs is what a great hotel should be. Excellent Mayfair location, surrounded by good restaurants & art galleries, and a short walk to most theaters. Excellent rooms, dining room, bar & fitness center & the Concierges are the very best. Wouldn‚Äôt think of staying anywhere else ‚Äî ever!"
January 2019,Classic hotel with great location,"The hotel is very conveniently located, walking distance to many good restaurants and shopping. A short taxi ride to some great museums. The restaurant was excellent. We had a very nice afternoon tea and the bar was warm and welcoming. The concierge was very helpful with suggestions and restaurant reservations. A perk was the Bentley car service that drove us to nearby restaurants."
January 2019,Brown‚Äôs Charming British Tea,"Come here for a relaxing cup of tea with delicious sandwiches, scones, and pastries. It‚Äôs a charmingly old-fashioned place, with friendly service and a good but quiet pianist. We especially enjoyed talking to Yonka (who makes her own special tea with rosebuds) about the history of the hotel, and Lorenzo."
January 2019,12 days and nights at Brown's hotel in Mayfair London.,"We have often stayed in London‚Ä¶ But have never received service, food and all-round hospitality that we received at Brown's.  All concierges were exceptional but I must make special mention of David Young who went out of his way to make our holiday exceptional. There was no task too difficult,  no question that was not answered to our satisfaction. The reception desk, the restaurant staff all the amenities were first-rate. When next we visit London our first stop will be Brown's hotel in Mayfair.  We could not help but mention to our friends in Australia about Brown's, I am not exaggerating when I say London was made very special we felt like we were coming home each evening and even though all services were professional we felt like we were among family.  Bruce Sherlock Sydney‚Ä¶"
January 2019,Newly refurbished restaurant is lovely...,"Though it's been open for a bit, I just got back to London and had lunch in the restaurant.  It's a beautiful room with great wall paper and overall design.  The linen and the glassware are superb.  Lunch itself was pleasant and tasty and completely reasonable price wise.  The wine list is exceptionally impressive.  Separately - I've been to Brown for tea and it's one of the best in London.  everything from sandwiches to sweets and fruit.  Can't go wrong."
December 2018,Excellent stay this time at Brown‚Äôs,"After having had some issues last time we stayed at this property we decided to have another go. This time everything was perfect. We received a very nice welcome from Janine Mallia, front of house manager, and an excellent upgrade. Concierge did an excellent job booking restaurants, theatre etc for us. All in all we were very pleased. The only potential issue is that the breakfast room can sometimes be very full since many guests from outside come to the hotel for breakfast and business discussions. Luckily I am an early bird so I did have a nice table each morning before the crowds arrived. I also enjoyed the fitness room and my wife was very well taken care of in the Spa."
December 2018,Amazing service in a beautiful hotel!,"My partner and I were upgraded into a classic suite and it was gorgeous - imagine watching TV from your tub!  But what is more, the service was impeccable and the team were insanely kind!  They knew we were there to celebrate our birthdays and they went above and beyond to treat us and make our stay extra special and just amazing!  Thank you Brown's team... and mostly, thank you to Janine, the Hotel Manager, who was just incredibly attentive, caring, thoughtful and overall fabulous!"
December 2018,Favorite Part of Our Trip!,"My sister and I had the best time doing the afternoon tea at Brown‚Äôs Hotel. The food was of amazing quality and the decor was perfect. Our server Yonka made the experience incredible. Aside from being a pleasure to talk to, her knowledge of the afternoon tea was extremely impressive. We wish she could have sat down and joined us! We‚Äôre definitely bringing our grandma back from the US to visit the Brown‚Äôs Hotel and meet Yonka!"
December 2018,Best Tea in London,"The experience of afternoon tea in at Brown's is undoubtedly the best in London.  Highlight of our New Year's trip, and that's saying a lot.  Atmosphere is warm and welcoming.  Service is friendly and impeccable.  Quality of food and selection of teas top notch.  Recommend the Gold."
December 2018,Perfect for a night in London during the Christmas Season!,"We stayed the weekend just before Christmas and had a lovely stay with a very warm and friendly welcome from both the doorman and the receptionist when we checked-in.  There had been a mix-up with our booking, which had been made via a third party.  The e'mail stated breakfast was included in the room rate, but this wasn't the case.  This has happened on a previous occasion at another hotel when using this particular hotel booking website, resulting in a rather lengthy phone call to sort it out.  In this instance however the receptionist immediately offered complimentary breakfast with no fuss, to save us the hassle of trying to sort it out, which was very much appreciated. The bedroom was large, light and airy and the bathroom was huge for a central London hotel.    The hotel‚Ä¶"
December 2018,Graciousness beyond the norm.....,"We chose Brown's because of its reputation for being family friendly, and its location.  We were thrilled on both counts.  The staff and accommodations could not have been more gracious, and our teen-age granddaughters were delighted with our breakfasts and high tea.  At the end of a busy day of touring, coming back to Brown's truly felt like coming home.  Kudos to a diligent, professional and truly friendly staff and a beautifully updated historic hotel."
December 2018,Super stay,"Stayed in December for 3 nights in a classic corner suite.  Very much enjoyed our stay, Madga in reservations was excellent and really set the stay up to be lovely, which was very much appreciated as it was our 35th anniversary.  The suite was lovely, overlooking the street and the breakfast service in room was excellent both in terms of the quality of food and the service, especially on our last day when we had an early flight and asked for a continental breakfast at 4am - they came and set it up in the room, regardless of the very early time - quite exceptional.  We had asked for a quiet private room and they had really thought about our needs.  Housekeeping was also excellent - very clean and tidy, and very much enjoyed the bed linens and furnishing and design.  Bathroom was‚Ä¶"
December 2018,Remarkable,4th stay at the Brown‚Äôs hotel. That was not the best one but this is still a fantastic place to enjoy the Christmas period in London. The renovated Donovan Bar is great and Beck finally found his place. 
December 2018,Faultless,"After so many disappointing stays in alternative London hotels , this will definitely be THE only option for me in London . From the minute I arrived, the check in staff had the premium factor expected of Mayfair but with the home from home element . The conceirge team ( David in particular ) could not have been more helpful having arranged, with little notice , reservations at London‚Äôs top restaurants , a make up artist and hairdresser at the drop of a hat . The food and drink was of such a high level too and I can‚Äôt wait to return next month"
December 2018,another fabulous pre-Christmas stay at Browns,"Christmas starts properly with a stay in this wonderful hotel and this year was no exception.  So lovely to be welcomed by long term staff, feels like coming home.  The Christmas decorations are amazing, we loved the look and feel of the newly refurbished dining room for breakfast in the morning and thank you for upgrading us to one of your wonderful suites.  The beds are still the most comfortable we have ever slept in.  Albermarle Street looked very festive with the lights outside - all in all a huge pre-Christmas treat!!"
December 2018,Wonderful Allergy Friendly Afternoon Tea,"I had the most wonderful afternoon tea at Browns Hotel on 7th December. I have a number of allergies being dairy free, gluten free, nut and seed free and low sugar. I‚Äôd almost given up on trying to have afternoon tea out in London. However when I made the reservation - Browns said that their chefs could cater for my allergies - no problem. I was so amazed as Fortnum and Mason had said that they could not cater for me and that I had to go and have afternoon tea somewhere else!!?? My afternoon tea was perfect at Browns Hotel with delicious sandwiches, scones and fabulous cakes. The service was excellent - Zoltan‚Äôs team were first class - nothing was too much trouble - very impressed!! The chefs who created my afternoon tea were excellent too!! It was the most wonderful afternoon‚Ä¶"
November 2018,Right Hotel at the right Place!,"TheRocco Forte Hotel BROWN‚ÄôS Hotel in London, at the Albemarle Street in Mayfair is a fine hotel. The reception was good and friendly. Service fine. Room just right. No nice from the streets. Bath comfortable, warming towels etc. We liked the Afternoon Tea at the Lounge. Perfect service. We love the elegance of the Rocco Forte Hotels in general."
November 2018,10 Stars Easily,A definite `Must do before we shuffle off our mortal coils`.The `Afternoon tea` is fantastic as are the staff.A classic English experience which we should share with all our family and friends. Truly historical.
November 2018,Lovely couples massage ,"We had a lovely couples massage followed by afternoon tea.   The spa staff were very pleasant and they bought my husband the most delicious birthday cake I have ever eaten!!   The went that extra mile to make our experience special, massages were very relaxing!!  The only thing I wish they had was a relaxation room, a place where we could have to wind down in our robes. Though the staff gave us the massage rooms for as long as we needed, it would have been nice  if there was a wholesome spa experience.   Overall very good massages and delicious cake!"
November 2018,A beautiful hotel in a fantastic location,"Loved our stay, this was our third visit and we definitely shall be returning for a fourth.  The staff both in the hotel and the bar are the friendliest we have seen in a very long time.  A fantastic location in easy reach to all the amazing highend shops, so many lovely restaurants nearby, the choice is mind blowing.  Thank you so much Browns, you have excelled yourself yet again."
October 2018,NOt so hot,"Convenient, excellent room, but lacking in the crispness, style and efficiency of the great Rocco Forte Hotels such as the Savoy or the Hotel des Ruisse...slow and slightly unfocused service.  Classic move that we all hate--they insist on taking light bags which are no trouble and then you're still waiting for them twenty minutes after your in your room.  Check in felt endless.  Nice people, well meaning, but need a little more direction."
November 2018,A Wonderful Stay,"A quick note about another wonderful week at Brown‚Äôs Hotel. What consistently impresses one about Brown‚Äôs is the attentiveness of the gracious staff. Upon arrival George (and I regret not knowing George‚Äôs proper title) took charge to ensure that our check-in was smooth. Since we had arrived at 10:50 on Remembrance Day, George offered either to get us to a service nearby or participate in the two minutes silence in the lobby. We attended in the lobby as George led the observance by staff and we marvelled that such a thing was not done in Canada. Two other examples of staff attentiveness stood out.  Upon returning to our room one day, the scruffy receipt that I‚Äôd been using as a bookmark had been supplemented by a Brown‚Äôs Hotel bookmark. You know your maid service is top notch if‚Ä¶"
September 2018,Fabulous Stay,"My husband and I just had our third fabulous stay at Brown‚Äôs. This is a perfect hotel! Our suite was large and beautifully decorated. The staff was warm, welcoming and helpful. The food and rom service at this hotel is great! It is in a wonderful location. We always look forward to returning!"
November 2018,Great hotel,Browns is a hidden gem in the heart of Mayfair. Rooms are a good size and the service is excellent. I would 100% stay here again and recommend it to anyone looking for somewhere boutique to stay in London.
November 2018,Quick coffee meeting,Quick coffee meeting - the staff were able to accommodate a table for two. The team are lovely here and we really felt welcomed as well as able to conduct our business. I‚Äôve been here for a drink in the evening too which is quite a lively atmosphere and worth coming in.
November 2018,Brief stay,"Wonderful 2 night stay. The staff were magnificent, nothing was a bother! The bar & restaurant were superb. Understated elegance! A little pricey but worth the money. The room was spacious and the bed very comfortable. Fruit & water we‚Äôre a lovely touch."
November 2018,Constant Disappointment,I have now been staying at  Browns Hotel quite often and what I have noticed over my last three stays is there is never any shower gel in sight but shampoo in the bottles labelled Shower Gel. I am sure this is not mis labelling at the manufacturers but this is done at the hotel. You call this a five star hotel?? Really?? What does the management think we are?? Frankly I think Browns Hotel needs to buck up its ideas and provide its guests the service they pay for.
October 2018,Best location and service,"The hotel is a pearl nested in the best location in town: Mayfair. Although it‚Äôs a busy neighborhood, the hotel is in a very quiet street.  All employees are very friendly, highly qualified and really strive to make one feel at home. The bar opens until late and has a wide variety of drinks."
October 2018,Excellent supper,"As always, Browns didn‚Äôt disappoint. First class, relaxing manicure, followed by an excellent supper. The service was fantastic and staff friendly and helpful. Wonderful, buzzy atmosphere in the bar and the food was sensational. Thank you!"
August 2018,"Divine dinner, wine and magical G and T",Went with 5 friends as a spoiling treat for dinner on Friday night. Food was as high a quality as you would expect and service impeccable and personable. Also highly recommend a Flower Power gin and tonic which changes colour in front of you!
August 2018,Tea for two,"My wife and I have been coming to Browns for over 20 years (we had one of our first dates there). In an age which everything seems to change, and not always for the better, it is reassuring that afternoon tea at Browns is still exceptional. Superb, unhurried service, comfortable and a lovely atmosphere make it the perfect place to spend a chilly afternoon. Already looking forward to our next visit. Thank you Browns, and keep up the good work."
August 2018,Always Absolutely Amazing,"If we could give Brown's 100 stars we would. We just returned from our second visit to London and our second time staying at the hotel. To say that this is a luxury property is spot on. The service is outstanding, and the staff is so friendly and welcoming. The property is so beautiful and boasts so much history and a perfect location. We were able to walk to so many locations.   David, the Head Concierge, is extraordinary. He assisted us with dinner reservations nightly, tips for planning activities during the day, and even helped me with hair appointments at a local salon.   The rooms are gorgeous and large for a European hotel. We love the Donovan Bar for drinks at night (best bar nuts and drink menu ever). We have stayed in many hotels all over the world and Brown's is hands‚Ä¶"
July 2018,Best Hotel in London,"We stayed at Brown's over the weekend and it is definitely the best hotel we have stayed in in London. Set between two of the nicest shopping streets in Mayfair, it is better located than many other nearby hotels which we have stayed in previously. The rooms are spacious, tastefully decorated and very clean with extremely comfortable beds. All the staff we encountered went out of their way to make us feel welcome, especially the doormen and porters who greeted us by name each morning. The concierge team were also all excellent, they were full of great recommendations for bars and restaurants (they managed to get us a table at Hide, the best new restaurant in London) as well as assisting us with transport when we left. Besides being helpful and knowledgeable, they were all very‚Ä¶"
June 2018,Exceptional hotel!,"We recently stayed at Brown's and can't say enough about our experience there. The location, the service, the dining options [including breakfast, dinner, high tea, and the bar], and the rooms were all top notch. All the staff were responsive, attentive, willing to help and bent over backwards to make our visit exceptional. We highly recommend Brown's."
August 2018,Great stay,"A lovely weekend stay at Browns. Service was fantastic and we were made to feel very welcome. Also a thank you to Max, Chris and Roy for supplying our umbrella‚Äôs when we were checking out in the pouring rain."
July 2018,Such a nice surprise!,"We have just spent a beautiful weekend at Browns. It was our first time there and everything was simply perfect: the room, quite, elegant and very confortable, the facilities and, moreover, the high level of service. The staff is kind, gentle, very professional without beeing too formal. When you get in, the entrance, certainly stylish, doesn‚Äôt reflect the overall excellent standard of the rest of the property but shortly you can discover the beautiful lunchroom of Beck‚Äôs restaurant and the sophisticated atmosphere of the Bar. We were used to stay in other hotels in Mayfair but we will be back at Browns! Piero and Annalisa Longo"
July 2018,perfect english spot,"Brown's is the perfect hotel for an english immersion. Great location, kind service, good tips on where and what to do, comfortable and quiet rooms, wonderful bar, and great food. A must for afternoon tea!"
July 2018,Customer Service Excellence,"One of my favourite London Hotels. You are always made to feel welcome, the staff are friendly and professional without being intrusive. The accommodation is of an exceptionally high standard and dining is a real experience for the seasoned foodie."
July 2018,Location and Service at it's finest!,"It had been many years since I last stepped foot into Brown's Hotel, and I was a little reluctant about our very recent stay.  After our recent family vacation, we all concurred that Brown's is one of the finest gems anywhere in the world!  Location is as good as it gets.  Centrally located, everything that we wanted to do was close by.  The rooms were blended traditional elegance with modern comfort; and were quite large by European standards.  The restaurants and bars are absolutely gorgeous, and my girls loved traditional tea time.  With all that said, the people at Brown's are as professional and hospitable as we have ever found at other very fine hotels around the world.  Their 24 hour concierge service was at our service around the clock. We look forward to staying at‚Ä¶"
August 2018,Wonderful Personable Hotel in the heart of London,"This was our first stay at Browns and it really did not disappoint. My wife and I love the Rocco Forte brand and had stayed often at the old Manchester property and the Mayfair located hotel was on our list. The promise of good weather, a break from the schedule and a family Birthday presented an ideal opportunity for a city mini break.  The service experience actually started at the time of booking where an incredibly helpful and obliging Paris tailored the Two rooms that we needed exactly to our needs and also to our budget by way of offering excellent value. Immediately after the booking was confirmed came the introduction and offer of assistance from the hotel Concierge team. A special mention must go to Paul who worked really hard to offer help and advice on visits and‚Ä¶"
October 2018,"Great location, Professional Staff","The hotel is a true classic.  It is one of the oldest hotels in London. It is in a great location in the heart of the luxurious shopping district of London and very close to the Green Park metro station.  I'm a fan of Rocco Forte Hotels chain and really love the professionalism of hotel staff as well as condition of their hotels.  When you're in one of their hotels, you know that you'll be staying in beautiful, clean and spacious rooms with great bathrooms with good amenities.  Always a beautiful bar, great breakfast and professional staff.  However, this time our bathroom had a maintenance problem.  Moreover, it was really uncomfortable to use the bathroom where its window only had a see-through linen curtain.  I hope we were not seen by people across the  building as we were‚Ä¶"
October 2018,Very fine hotel in the center of London,"This is a really nice hotel.  There's a doorman to greet you and hail a cab and inside it is beautifully decorated in an elegant, European style.  The lounge and tea room are beautiful and a piano player on weekend creates a nice atmosphere.  The breakfast service is very good and the staff are very professional and attentive.  The rooms are nicely appointed and ours had a very good sized bathroom. The only downside is the awful traffic in London.  It is great to be centrally located but awful when it takes 30 minutes to get on to Piccadilly to actually begin a journey. Much easier to walk two blocks to the underground station at Green Park."
November 2017,Hidden gem,"I've seen a lot of (very) good hotels in London, but this one is definitely my favourite. It's located just behind Bond Street, yet in a rather quiet street (be it with good bars and restaurants very near), so you have all of the advantages of the city centre, without the noise. The room was excellent and so was the service: truly what you can hope a 5* hotel to deliver. Nice and clean rooms, helpful and friendly staff, and a very chique and trendy yet classic interior. The only minor commentary I can give is that our suite had views over the courtyard, which was not bad, but not very exciting either. But aside from that: a wonderful experience. I'll definitely stay here again!"
August 2018,Friends visit to London,"The hotel itself has lots of history and grandeur. But it would be great if that could be displayed a bit more in the hotel, and by that I mean the stories behind the building and the bar itself etc. It is one of the best hotels catered for families, although we didn't bring children. Great location in London. Must admit I prefer the quieter areas, but as it was a city trip there is no escaping the hustle and bustle. Rooms were clean, but stairwell and hallways could do with a fresh up and deep clean of the carpets. Upon check-in there was a bit confusion as to the bed and bedding, which was resolved, as we decided to cope with a king bed instead of the preferred 2 twins.  Doormen and concierges have great tips to make your stay comfortable and fun. And umbrellas to use when‚Ä¶"
October 2018,Room far below expectation,I booked an executive room that probably is the entry level room for this property. The room was small and not charming but confortabile. The view from the room was on some technical equipment just outside the window... in my opinion this is not a room of a first class hotel even if the cheapest one. 
September 2018,The Donovan Bar,"Had a gorgeous evening in The Donovan Bar, enjoying a coktail with friends. It will surely be the first of many! Not only is the atmosphere luxurious but the service is impeccable. Mid week at Browns in Mayfair has been revamped with live jazz, perfect for leisure, business, or both. As a discerning guest I was very impressed with the authenticity and standard of hospitality! thank you!"
September 2018,PERFECTION has a name: BROWN'S Hotel in London!,"This is my favourite Hotel in London! It is always a pleasure to stay at the BROWN'S.  Upon the arrival the doorman called me by my name. According to the Hotel's fine reputation  the service is very professional and personalised (reception, concierge, restaurant, bar..). They are all so attentive and pay attention to every detail. I really felt at home and enjoyed every moment of my stay.   Luxurious and elegant atmosphere with a twist of Dolce Vita-feeling (also italian staff)!   Accomodation: quiet, very comfortable bed, walk-in shower (eco-friendly amenities),  perfect housekeeping. Delicious breakfast, fine dining in stylish location, first quality products.  Tiny SPA: excellent Thai massage by KARMINI!  Perfect situation in walking distance to high-end boutiques,‚Ä¶"
September 2018,Girls' lunch and celebratory dinner,"I love the refurbishment of both restaurant (now Beck at Brown‚Äôs) and the extended Donovan Bar. My first post-refurbishment visit was lunch in Beck at Brown‚Äôs, which now has an extended bar area with comfortable seating - ideal for that aperitif whilst awaiting the arrival of friends rather than having to go straight to your table.  My second visit, a celebratory dinner, commenced with cocktails in Terence Donovan‚Äôs ‚ÄòNaughty Corner‚Äô in the Donovan Bar (now about twice its original size, spacious and with extended bar and seating) before dining in the restaurant. As a result of my brother-in-law‚Äôs interest in wines, the sommelier took more time than normally expected to discuss various options and make recommendations to ensure the right choices were made to complement our menu‚Ä¶"
September 2018,London‚Äôs First Hotel is still tops,"We have been to London almost 2 dozen times. We‚Äôve stayed in hotels and rented an Apartment .(flat) So staying at Browns comes with a good deal of experience. We love the location. Our suite was large, comfortable and very lovely. The service of a small hotel was very noticeable here.  I recommend Browns without any hestitation."
April 2018,"A beautiful hotel, complimented by exemplary personal service.","My stay at Brown's hotel was fabulous, from the moment I arrived, the team were lovely, they paid attention to all the finer details, the personal touches are what makes an experience memorable. The rooms are fabulous, lovely natural light, old school charm and luxury with stunning bathrooms. After travelling over 24 hours from Australia, I had the most wonderful sleep in their beautiful beds with the most comfortable pillows. The entire team across all departments have so much pride in what they do and it was a delight to stay here. A true compliment to the entire team at Brown's.   Will most definitely be staying here when I travel to London."
April 2018,Weekend at Brown‚Äôs,"We stayed at Brown‚Äôs hotel only for one night,but it was an amazing experience. At the time of booking we‚Äôve mensioned that this stay is for a special occasion -as a surprise  we had a welcome Champagne and chocolate dipped Strawberries and rose pettals in the room. The room was very specious with beautiful bathroom. Part of the evening we spent in the hotel restaurant where we enjoyed lovely dinner with Wine pairing and I have to say - it was a real pleasure to be served by Sommelier Emmanuelle. His choice of wines and knowledge were incredible. We preordered breakfast for the next morning and asked it to be delivered at 10 15 but we woke up very early and asked it to be delivered sooner and they brought our food shortly after we called. Thanks for everything Brown‚Äôs, I cannot‚Ä¶"
May 2018,Excellent Hotel Top Class Staff,"This is an absolutely excellent hotel, it is my favourite hotel in London, we always stay here when we are in London and we wouldn't consider anywhere else! The hotel is in a great location, there are lots of shops and restaurants close by and being in the centre of London there will be something to do for everyone. The rooms are spotless, they are very clean and comfortable. The staff are fabulous, they are always so friendly and attentive in particular Givi and Max. Thanks again to all staff at Browns for another fantastic experience and I am already looking forward to my next stay. Best wishes, Nuailin"
April 2018,A Fine Hotel,"To paraphrase Dr Johnson ""When you're tired of Brown's, you're tired of London"".  This is a hotel at the top of its game, and the beautiful recent refurbishment of the downstairs areas, including the bar and restaurant completes the picture. Brown's is one of a handful of 5 star London hotels and richly deserves the fine reputation it holds.  It is an historic hotel with the occasional quirkiness you'd expect from a very old building, and its location in Mayfair is perfect for dining and shopping, and close to most galleries and museums. The balance between contemporary design and historical inclusions is a triumph.  The rooms are generously proportioned, decorated in a relaxed, comfortable, contemporary style, and the bathrooms are large, attractive and well-equipped. Both are‚Ä¶"
April 2018,great in every way,"the browns hotel is great in every way: location, rooms, bar, restaurant and gym. we have stayed there more than 5 times for london weekend trips. Staff deserves special mention - very attentive and polite."
April 2018,Amazing hotel !!!!,We have stayed in Brown‚Äôs for my partners birthday. I have booked this as surprised and we loved every moment of our stay. Staff was friendly and accommodating all last minute request. Room was clean and top condition.  And the Dinner in restaurants was top class. Will recommend this hotel to everyone.  We will definitely be back thank you all for amazing stay. 
April 2018,A London treasure.,"Browns hotel is the oldest hotel in London and retains many original features coupled beautifully with some contemporary features. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Our room was spacious , immaculate and very comfortable. The Donovan Bar was the perfect place for a pre dinner cocktail. We had an amazing stay."
April 2018,For business with pleasure!,"My wife and I recently stayed here for a meeting at the QE II conference center. I chose it for the recommendations and location. It was a 20 min walk to the conference, much of it through the park. A metro station was one block away. From the minute the doorman greeted my wife and I, the experience was superb. All of the staff, doormen, registration, concierge staff, and restaurant staff made sure our experience was great. They made me feel like I was the most important guest they had. There were a lot of business people staying there, so suits and jackets were common in the restaurant and bar, but casual was also welcome. My wife was taken care of by the staff while I was in meetings. Our room was comfortable and room service excellent. When a tour they recommended was not‚Ä¶"
April 2018,An experience,"It was something I think, one should do, just once....have an English high tea at TheEnglish Tea Room at Brown's, the hotel where 'it all started'.... Thus it was with great anticipation, that my companions and I gathered for our high tea at Brown's. We did enjoy our outing; the welcome was warm, and the service efficient and professionally friendly. Four of us had the Traditional Afternoon Tea, while one opted for the Tea-Tox Menu. There was ample food to go around (tasty too) and the service staff was conscientious in asking if we wanted further servings. The atmosphere was comfy and just as it should be... (I am assuming that most people go to tea at Brown's because well, it *is* Brown's..) and my companions and I enjoyed our afternoon there.  It is quite pricey, but if you‚Ä¶"
April 2018,"Breakfast, fantastic","I went to have breakfast with a client and we both loooooved our time there. Eggs were perfectly cooked, my croissant was delicious. Very elegant, staff absolutely perfect, too. I will go back soon and I would recomment to anyone."
June 2018,Spacious and elegant rooms; great location,"Our new favorite in London! We have never stayed this close to Piccadilly, Regent Street and Bond Street. This old style traditional British hotel feels like it's family operated; the doormen and receptionists know your name after one day and you feel really looked after. The breakfast restaurant is cozy and comfortable both in size and style; the food served is between good and great (haven't tried the evening restaurant, which seems to have a great reputation for exquisite Italian food). We loved our (Deluxe) rooms which were very spacious with lots of cupboard room and a big bathroom. This hotel deserves to be up there with the best in London."
July 2018,Very Friendly,"We stayed here over the marathon weekend as the hotel we usually stay in was full and we were dining with friends nearby. I think this will now become our go to hotel, very friendly staff great you with a smile, the hotel it's self is beautiful and the rooms , clean comfortable and well equipped, except that is for tea making facilities (my usual gripe). Had cocktails in the bar, a good choice , around ¬£20 each unless you want one of the very special ones (nearly died  at some of the prices, but dont think anyone ever has a cocktail over 5 grand). Good atmosphere. We didnt eat there as we were out that evening an  left very early the next day...maybe next time."
June 2018,Amazing!,"I stayed at Brown's for the first time recently and it has quickly become one of my favourite hotels to stay in on my visits to London. I dined in their restaurant one night which I believe had just opened and I have only one word to describe it - incredible! The food was delicious and the staff were so welcoming, I'm already looking forward to my next stay!"
June 2018,all time my favorite!,"We had stayed 2 nights and a afternoon tea at their traditional tea room. They provided us professional, warm and sicere service through out our stay. Especially all the staffs at concierge desk are very professional and replied promptly to our requests all the time and we had such a lovely time there. Also their afternoon tea is the best in London. I have had afternoon tea at Ritz, Capital Hotel, and many other famous hotels in London, but the afternoon tea at Browns is the best!"
June 2018,Afternoon Tea,This might be the best place in London for tea.  The service and choices where excellent and they went over the top to accommodate one of our travel partners that has issues with nuts.  Fun part of London as well.
June 2018,Browns Wins again!,We come here whenever we are in London and never fail to be impressed. It is renowned for High Tea and it does not fail to deliver. When Janine explained the History behind the Hotel we knew even more why and how it retains its position of Numero Uno. The owners build a team who care for your experience.
June 2018,Wonderful staff reunion,Thank you to all the staff at Brown's Hotel who looked after us so well during our ex-cashiers reunion last weekend. We worked there in the early 80's and thoroughly  enjoyed catching up on 'the good old days'.  The afternoon tea was delicious and plentiful and we loved the updates the hotel has undergone although were relieved to see that it continues to retain it's unique character and atmosphere.  Thank you for helping us to create more happy memories of Brown's. We'll be back but hopefully we won't leave it another 30 years until the next one!
February 2018,Classy and Stylish,I spent a  memorable evening in this charming hotel which is located in the elegant area of Mayfair. Their piano bar exhibits the B&W photographs of Terence Donovan in its walls and has one of the finest cocktails you can possibly find in London. The main restaurant offers a unique Italian menu with a wide selection of international fine wines. I could go on and on talking about the delicious dishes and drinks I had (especially the Mersault wine) but I'd like to highlight the outstanding service they offer. They really know how to make a guest feel at home and special.
June 2018,What a GREAT hotel!,"I travel around the US with clients looking at real estate and travel around the world with my wife on vacations.  This is one of the BEST RUN hotels we have stayed in.  The location is GREAT, the room was GREAT, the staff was GREAT.  We'll be back!"
June 2018,A special trip requiring a special base from where to taste London shopping,"We last visited London's Browns Hotel 8 years ago - at that time we rated it OK but a little tired. This time therefore was always going to be under the microscope. What a transformation! It is now simply one of the finest hotels we have visited - every aspect was truly special - from check in to check out some 4 days later - accommodation superb, housekeeping, valeting, in-room dining, reception, concierge service, all couldn't be better. Add to that the now beautiful lounge bar (a disappointment some 8 years ago) with comfortable seating, and a truly exceptional restaurant (now Becks) with food among the finest we've ever eaten anywhere (and we've stayed at some truly world class hotels all over the world), coupled with top class service, and the wonderful experience was‚Ä¶"
April 2018,H and D clark,"Whilst we‚Äôre regular guests at Browns the entire experience is always exceptional and somehow just continues to get better.  From the moment you arrive and are greeted by the doorman, followed closely by the wonderful Givvy (the MOST helpful man in Ldn) you feel ‚Äújust like you‚Äôre back at home ‚Äú. The entire experience from guest acknowledgement, service, cleanliness to ambiance and making everyone feel special doesn‚Äôt change whether you‚Äôre a 1st time guest or returning one. We can honestly say there is NO better concierge team worldwide. As extensive travellers we can call upon David Young and his team 24/7 to assist with anything- nothing is ever a problem and they always have a solution! If you haven‚Äôt been to Browns you‚Äôre missing out... a must stay when in Ldn. "
April 2018,Not quiet,"I have visited this hotel in February - the room is good. The toilet as well. The only problem, and a major one, is that it isn‚Äôt a quiet hotel. The flooring is out of wood and you can easily here when someone in the room above yours walks or moves. You can also hear very well if someone passes through the corridor. I seriously had to wake up at 8 am everyday, regardless of what time i slept. I never went back to this hotel because I‚Äôm a light sleeper. Shouldn‚Äôt be a problem if you aren‚Äôt."
May 2017,A wonderful bar with great staff,"As we discovered that the Royal Institution was not open on a Saturday we wandered across the road to have a drink in the Donovan bar at Brown's. I was interested in the portraits on display of people largely from the 60s and 70s but the decor was also very good, giving a relaxing ambience. The selection of gins on offer was interesting and my husband chose a good one with the help of the bar man. I felt like a sorbet but that was not available when we were there so I had wonderful fresh mint tea - which came with home made biscuits which were deliciously crispy. (The cost was waived as I had not been able to have a sorbet, which came as a delightful surprise.) This is a wonderful place to stop off and refresh oneself just away from the bustle of Pall Mall. The drinks are great‚Ä¶"
April 2018,Customer Service at its best!,"My dad and stepmom stayed at The Browns, and I enlisted the concierge's help to surprise my stepmom for her birthday. They far surpassed my expectations, put together a beautiful fruit spread and cake with a note from me. She was so touched by the surprise, they really went above and beyond to help me surprise her."
April 2018,A true British luxury hotel,"We stayed here for our first weekend without kids for many years. The experience was excellent for both me and my wife. The hotel's location is just perfect with walking distance to all you need on a couples weekend getaway. The staff were great and we really enjoyed the room, the restaurant, SPA and everything else this 5 star boutique hotel has to offer"
April 2018,T. Boyer,"A friend and I stayed at Brown‚Äôs for six nights last week to celebrate a milestone birthday. We had a fabulous experience - a lovely, spacious room; excellent service all around; a staff that responded quickly and graciously to all of our inquiries and requests; a location that, while on a quiet street, is close to the action in Soho and within walking distance to almost everything we did throughout our visit. We happily returned to the tranquility of the hotel at the end of our busy day - a calm in the storm that is London - to enjoy a glass of wine in the bar before turning in.  We will be back again!!!"
April 2018,Yes.,"I stayed a week here. It was an incredible experience that I will never forget and definitely my favourite London hotel experience by far. There is nothing quite like a boutique hotel, especially Brown's."
April 2018,"‚ÄúExcellent environment, friendly service, great menu choices and really brillant food and affordable prices''","we had an awesome lunch experience at Browns Hotel with a very professional stuff in a  bohemian atmosphere. The starters were amazing, burrata with marinated courgette and dressed crab with grilled Roman lettuce. Since I'm an Italian pasta lover I ordered house- made Spaghetti al ''cacio e pepe'' with peccorino cheese on lime- marinated langouistines I felt like beeing in Rome, pasta sky on earth, very tasty-  a must try!        My friend has been very exited about the pea soup with fresh mint and quinoa, fantasticly bright, light with a great balance. As well the red mullet sandwich has been delicious.  ‚ÄúJust a quick thank you for the hospitality and excellent food we had when we visited yesterday. We will certainly be returning in the near future.‚Äú"
March 2018,Barnaby Warboys,"The best that London has to offer!  The location is excellent - near Bond Street, Piccadilly, the Royal Academy, and a walkable distance to the National Gallery and National Portrait Gallery, the Mall, the Palace and Green Park"
March 2018,An Oasis of calm in a busy City,"An exceptional hotel. Rooms and d√©cor are immaculate as you would expect in a hotel of this quality.  What really makes Brown's stand apart however is its staff.  They are personal, helpful and caring.  Its clear they take great pride in their job.  The staff not only ask how your day was but remember your answers and take an interest when they see you again. Cookies with the children's names on supplied as a surprise after a busy day. A concierge that can organise almost anything. Its all in the detail and at Browns there's lots of detail.   As an example my six you old son picked up a sickness bug whilst we were in London from the tube or another public place.  On returning to Browns that evening with him in my arms we had everything we needed within 2 mins of returning. ‚Ä¶"
February 2018,Wonderful stay at London's finest hotel,"Great location in the heart of Mayfair. Attention to detail, great staff and service. A lovely room with a view. We felt pampered our entire stay. Concierge made every reservation we requested. Afternoon tea is a must. Highly recommend"
March 2018,Perfection. ,"Not one thing to fault. True perfection. We spent 3 nights with two children in two interconnecting rooms. The rooms were stylish, welcoming, impeccably cleaned with fantastic walk-in wardrobes and modern bathrooms. Service was always truly professional and totally genuine. We were made to feel at home and we relaxed straight away. A perfect 5 star hotel that welcomes families and indeed caters for them with such wonderful touches, children themed bedding with a teddy bear for each child, children toiletries in the bathroom, small slippers and dressing gowns, children‚Äôs magazines and even welcome cookies in the room with their names iced upon. The children‚Äôs private tour of London was not to be missed and  something they shall remember forever. The hotel restaurant was‚Ä¶"
March 2018,Special Occasion,"This was the second time that we have been fortunate to stay at Brown‚Äôs,  an iconic hotel and a superb experience. All of the hotel staff were extremely professional and friendly and our suite was simply divine. I would not hesitate to recommend the hotel to anyone and it could only be described as perfect."
December 2017,Brooks Investment Presentation,"I was invited to this property investment presentation in this hotel.  It was a small and personal presentation in a room on the first floor.  I was impressed with the Ruinart champagne that was served. It was that impressive I didnt need to try the red wine. We were treated to some quality canapes and the service was A1.  By the way, the presentation was interesting to the point where I had committed to invest.  I noticed there was a nice bar called Donovan donwstairs. I look forward to trying and reviewing."
February 2018,F&B Service lets it down,"Great welcome but struggled to get any service at lunch and breakfast. And low seats in breakfast area are not good for eating at. A real pity because a great detail has gone into all else, but people make the difference!"
February 2018,Greatest Choice to Stay in London,"Brown‚Äôs hotel is the best location you can find in London. Mayfair is centrally located and walking distance to every place, neighborhoods, restaurants, shops and major attractions.  The hotel has wonderfull and friendly staff, always helpful to get everything you need, from the front desk to the concierge and the general manager. They all made us feel like we were at home. Definetely Brown‚Äôs Hotel is a place to return without any doubt. Congratulations."
February 2018,afternoon tea,part of a big group in private room. we took a whilst I get settled / started but  food was delicious . staff very helpful . they kept refilling the plates until we could eat no more. a nice birthday treat.  
December 2017,Discrete Charm,"I have been here a few times and do love it, small, attentive and charming. Rooms are quiet and comfortable. Service is very good but detailed, location is perfect. The bar is good and Dover st is lovely."
February 2018,Great Classic Hotel,"great location in center of London, perfect for shopping and culture..Browns is a very stylish hotel with classic friendly service. Very nice decorated rooms and nice restaurant & bar. Of course the classic High tea !"
January 2018,Really nice stay,"Stayed here for my 40th and it was fab.  Room was nice and spaceous and it was very quiet at night (we overlooked the court yard).  Breakfast was also really nice. It‚Äôs not a flashy grand hotel but comfortable with very attentive service.  The afternoon tea here is great too, I have been to a number of places in London for afternoon tea and keep coming back to Browns as it is very constitent and the food is really delicious and thoughfully prepared."
October 2017,Buzzing Bar!,We just called in to this hotel bar for a drink following lunch at The Ritz. We clearly hadn't booked a table and although there were many vacant tables we had to hang around before being shown somewhere to sit. We enjoyed an hour here catching up  with friends over a couple of drinks while admiring the photographs. In future we would book a table and would recommend folk coming here to do the same even though our waitress thought that this was unnecessary.
November 2017,So far the best hotel I have been in London,"I have stayed in this hotel for 1 night on boxing day. Honestly nothing to complain about. I stayed in executive room category which is one category higher than the classic room. The room size was excellent for london. It was really big and toilet was very clean and spacious. Comfortable bed. Clean room. Check-in was easy and the lady was extremely friendly, kind, and informative. Breakfast was good as well. The chauffeur service is an add on and useful. Handy phone was a plus and useful also. Location is the best you can be in London. All luxurious shopping is just few meters away of the hotel. Lots of high end restaurants are walking distance as well. Price is reasonable as well. I stayed in other 5 star hotels in London and even leading hotel of the world but wasn't anywhere‚Ä¶"
October 2017,Weekend in London ,"We stayed at Browns last weekend for a bit of R and R , good restaurants and good shopping as the hotel is perfectly located behind New Bond St.  We drove up from Surrey which as we knew would have more things to take home seemed like a good idea , I had already enquired about valet parking which at ¬£50 per 24 hrs seemed really reasonable ! They were aware of our car details and when we pulled up were waiting to whisk the car off and get us checked in . Within a few minutes we were in our junior suite over looking Albemarle St .  Beautiful room , Queen bed , sitting room, walk in wardrobe and bathroom with double sinks , bath and large shower , perfect for a couple of nights . Nothing to be disappointed in.  Breakfast was included on the Saturday morning we dined there, amazing‚Ä¶"
November 2017,"Manhattan, NY guests winter 2018","This gem is a wonderful classic British hotel in the heart of Mayfair.  The professional staff aims to please without being too formal or obsequious.  The hotel has the amenities of a larger hotel despite its smaller size which gives it a homey feel.  The street doesn't get much auto traffic but when you step outside there are restaurants, galleries, and coffee shops.  Cabs were readily available and the is  just a few minutes away."
October 2017,Not too hidden treasure,"Unbelievable service, perfect rooms, the best location and the restaurant and bars are the best.  The food at the restaurant was excellent and the wines were great.  The people who work at this hotel are the friendliest yet respectful and helpful.  The rooms were serviced perfect every time and being the hotel is not huge you did not have a long wait for the elevator and the lobby was quiet yet busy.  Highly recommend this hotel!"
October 2017,Wonderful Afternoon Tea in the English Tea Room at Brown's!!!!,"I took my daughter, who is a university student in London, to the Brown's Hotel for the Afternoon Tea in the English Tea Room. We enjoyed it so much! The atmosphere is absolutely stunning with the piano player playing, the fireplace lit, the tastefully decorated room with elegant and comfortable furniture and a very professional staff. Our waiter, Ennio, kindly made sure we were well looked after at all times.  We enjoyed the Tea Tox Afternoon Tea which is a lighter version of the traditional English Afternoon Tea and that suited us just perfectly; it was in every respect a most delicious choice! When it comes to the tea again I can speak only in superlatives; the Brown's House Afternoon black tea is absolutely delicious and very fine. I am glad that I was able to purchase a set‚Ä¶"
October 2017,Perfect from start til finish!,"We arrived at the Brown's hotel after a very long flight from Los Angeles where we were going to visit our daughter who was studying abroad.  The staff provided impeccable hospitality from the moment we were greeted by the doorman until we were escorted to our room and our bags delivered.  The entire 5 day stay was flawless. Room service each morning was beautifully presented and delicious. Cocktails in the lounge were wonderful as was the service! We asked a lot of the concierge team and they exceeded our expectations.  I was trying to arrange for a French macaroon class for myself and 20 year old daughter. The concierge presented a couple of options but none worked out because we were trying to do the class on a Sunday afternoon.  Trying to ""deliver"" for us, the concierge‚Ä¶"
September 2017,Comfort and Service Extraordinaire!,"Brown‚Äôs is difficult to beat for luxury, service and location. It has everything for the leisure traveler. My wife and I enjoyed 5 nights at this incomparable hotel and every need was met, some even before we requested them.  On arrival, we were shown to an upgraded room, available through the AMEX Platinum travel program if an upgrade is available. The junior suite had a large king bed, extremely comfortable, a huge bathroom with two sinks, bathtub and separate enclosed shower stall. The ac system worked perfectly and this was important because London was unseasonably warm and the only window was on the courtyard. Do not expect a view at Brown‚Äôs. It is only 5 stories and located in the heart of Mayfair where it towers over nothing.  The room lighting was strong. The only‚Ä¶"
February 2017,Afternoon tea,Lovely afternoon with delightful food and very nice and attentive service. We will definetely come again. We tried both the traditional and the tea-tox meny and they can bith be recommended.  The scones were absolutely perfect and everything was filled up as many times as we wanted.   
October 2017,Perfect stay,We had a fabulous stay at browns hotel and will definitely be back to stay again. The staff were exceptional and made our stay very welcoming. The location of the hotel is perfect and we love the quintessential English feel of the hotel. 
June 2017,Excellent service,Very nice hotel ! Excellent accomodation and friendly staf . The drinks in the bar are a little bit overpriced . Breakfast very good . The hotel is located very good for shopping and a lot of good restaurants
May 2017,"Quaint, Comfortable, and Convenient","I stayed at Brown‚Äôs recently on a short trip to London and had a great experience.  Brown‚Äôs is located in Mayfair, not the most happening spot, but perfect for being centrally located for both work and touristy activities.  I was close enough to run in Hyde Park but also able to quickly get to meetings around the city.  The staff at the hotel was friendly and on top of everything ‚Äì I could not walk a few steps without being offered help. One note is that they forgot to mention that breakfast was included in my room.  The room was really comfortable with decent modern amenities and a really nice bathroom.  It was also really quiet and decently sizable, which I appreciate.  The bar at the hotel was great as well, with signature drinks for night and a decent place to take meetings‚Ä¶"
June 2017,Everything you expect and more,"I first stayed here with my wife for a weekend and the last time was with my wife and 2 daughters.  Each visit has been perfect.  On the first stay I ordered the romantic getaway offer for our anniversary as Brown's is somewhere my wife has always wanted to stay.  Everything was perfect, from checkin to our own monogrammed dressing gowns when we got to the suite.  However, the real treat was afternoon tea when they presented us with a special desert selection and plate with happy anniversary written in chocolate.  We did not expect this and it was a lovely surprise.  The last time we stayed was for Easter, with the girls.  The girls had their own room and Browns had made a real effort with stuffed toys for the beds and bath toys for the bathroom.  The easter egg hunt was fun and‚Ä¶"
June 2017,THE place to be for a pre-dinner aperitif,"I should say we didn't stay in the hotel, but we were eating at the Ritz to celebrate our son being presented with the Duke of Edinburgh Gold award earlier on in the day.  The Donovan bar in Browns proved to be the perfect location for a pre-dinner aperitif.  A warm ambience greeted us as the doors were politely opened in front of us.  I would have preferred my whisky served in a proper whisky glass rather than a tall cocktail glass, but that's my only slight criticism, apart from that a very pleasant visit."
October 2016,Always familiar - Excellent - 2 stays in June,"What a delight to come back to an old favourite. Years ago I used to stay in the Four Seasons Hyde Park but when it went through some renovation I had to find alternative accommodation - FS was gracious and actually introduced me to several fine hotels in London and I picked browns because I do not need some of the luxuries in other hotels whereas others that are important to me are well delivered at Brown's. For many good reasons I have stuck to Brown's as it delights in every way. Food is excellent, rooms are immaculate, general service is great, concierge well staffed, good restaurant, great bar and tea room and superb location as I enjoy many of the fine dining restaurants close by. The managers seem to be able to deliver a solid product by retaining good staff and they all‚Ä¶"
June 2017,The Ultimate High Tea,A chef that lived in London for decades told me to go here. It's pricey but the best you'll find in the place that does this kind of thing. I'm gluten free and that didn't affect my bliss at all. Trays of artful food were presented in a lovely antique setting. Do this if you're in London and you want to treat yourself.
February 2017,Wonderful afternoon tea,"We went here for my sister's birthday celebration.  I love afternoon tea and have been lucky enough to have had a few very nice ones.  Brown's was definitely one of the best.  Delicious tea,  nice cosy surroundings but best of all was the service.  The staff managed to be friendly and super attentive without fussing and getting in the way.  I would say that their excellent staff made the occasion very special - along with the lovely tea of course!"
June 2017,So good!,"Rarely do I enjoy a hotel enough to look forward to a return visit.  However Brown's is in a class by itself.  The friendly, professional staff are very helpful and welcoming.  The rooms are just about perfect (except for a slippery bathtub) and the beds are comfortable. The lobby is limited but we were able to use the tea room to play games in the evening. And the food is truly outstanding.  The English tea room combines the right mood and decor with traditional tea sandwiches and treats (leave room for the scones). The hotel restaurant served one of the best dinners of our week-long feast. The same restaurant provided the wonderful daily breakfasts that were included in the room rate."
June 2017,Best location in London ,"Stayed in a standard classic room, which I found to be much bigger than the standard London size, excelent cocktails at the Donovan Bar, the restaurant was quite full so my booking was pushed back 15 minutes and a complimentary drink was offered. All the staff was very nice and helpful and the location is unbeatable. "
June 2017,"Amazing position, Fantastic Hotel","My 5 night stay at this hotel was flawless.  Fantastic big rooms with a walk in wardrobe, big bathroom with bath and a big comfy bed.  The bars downstairs were the best way to end your day, you must try and cheese platter with the most amazing chestnuts I have every tasted.  The concierges were fantastic and overall the staff were super friendly and so efficient.  I loved everything about this hotel and its in the best position, walked to Buckingham Place, Hyde Park and fantastic shopping all around you.  Highly recommended and cannot wait to return."
February 2017,Birthday dinner with friends,"I had a truly wonderful dinner at HIX Mayfair for my friends birthday, everything was really exceptional from the service to the food. I had the steak tartare because it's a favourite of mine and this one really outshone any I've had in the past. 10/10 would recommend to a friend "
April 2017,very enjoyable,"Very comfortable modern bedrooms, good service from willing well trained staff, delicious breakfast with many healthy choices (Madeleine Shaw dishes).  Perfect for central London with a lively bar which is perfect for a G&T at the end of the day!"
May 2017,Perfect weekend ,"What a amazing hotel in London first time here but will definitely return. amazing room, service, fantastic food!  great location will definitely be recommending to my friends best hotel I have been too in London.  "
May 2017,Excellent as always,"The best service as always - my preferred choice in London. Perfect location, never too busy, historic building - I have been staying here for 15 years and the hotel is always consistent. Look forward to my next stay..."
April 2017,My London Love,I love this hotel. My boyfriend is in London very often and sometimes I¬¥m lucky enough to join him :-) The Browns is like our second home. Always feel welcome and it`s some kind of familiar. The location/ neighbourhood is lovely Mayfair. Very posh and just a scroll from Oxford Street / Bond Street for shopping. The rooms are lovely and very high end and there`s nothing the staff wouldn`t do to make their guests feeling comfortable and this in a very gentle and decent way. There are other high class hotels in London where the staff is really pushy but not at the Browns. Very professional. Thank you for being so lovely.
April 2017,On arrival  immediately felt like returning friends,"We arrived in the freezing London rain worn out from several days of travel. Immediately we felt like returning friends with the warm welcome from  the staff. All the staff were courteous and attentive without being intrusive. The rooms were large, clean and beautifully prepared.  Thanks for a welcoming stay."
November 2016,Barrister,"First rate in all respects - facilities, staff, service, food, and location. John the Doorman is a delight - the best professional I have ever encountered in that job in all my travels! I would give Brown's 10 stars..."
April 2017,Disappointed. Did not meet expectations.,"Check in Nothing special.  No welcome drink or personalized seated check in.  Did receive upgraded room as booked through FHR.   Room Junior Suite on 5th floor.  Large room, comfy bed/linens, although 2 singles pushed together, so ridge in middle.  Room needed upgrade. Stains on carpet; bathroom old with shower over bath; AC unit very loud and not very effective.  No view.  No iron/ironing board in room. Had to request. Had to request hairdryer. Would like more complimentary water. Did receive welcome chocolates and fruit.  Housekeeping Was impressed with housekeeping. Generally very good.  Only comment is that on night 2 they didn't do turn down until 9.30pm (after saying they'd do it at 8pm), which meant we were in the room at the time  Afternoon tea Pleasant but slow service.‚Ä¶"
April 2017,hospitality,"Very warm hospitality in the room, at reception, at concierge,transport driver,at restaurant and door men. Everybody works smartly and carefully. Very good access to Barlington arcade and Jermin street which are our favourite places."
April 2017,Mayfair gem,"Stayed at the Brown's hotel a few times and love it. Great hotel. great hospitality, great location, Indian restaurant across street was fantastic. Love staying here. Great location, easy access to the tube."
August 2017,Afternoon Tea,I ended up booking Browns for afternoon tea as Claridges was full so I wasn't sure what to expect. I contacted beforehand to explain I had a nut allergy and that my mum doesnt eat meat or eggs or cheese  (a tricky combination of people). We areived 20 minutes early which enabled us to grab the seats next to the open fire which was exquisite. The staff were SO friendly and helpful. The setting was beautiful and the chef had created sandwiches and cakes especially for our dietry requirements. Highly recommend it here!!
August 2017,Grand Dame still (again) in great form,"Splendidly refurbished, this older, charming hotel still competes at high level. exceptional service, great location, and quintessential British charm. Home of the iconic afternoon tea experience. Concierges know the insider tricks of navigating London"
August 2017,One of the best London hotels by far,"Fantastic hotel in one of the best locations to explore London. Spacious and comfortable rooms and very family friendly, Staff were attentive and helpful at all times and the gifts for the kids were a lovely extra touch. HIX restaurant thoroughly recommended although we did not have time for the afternoon tea this time round.. Great hotel.. Many thanks for making us feel so much at home.  "
August 2017,London Weekend,Fabulous hotel in an excellent location. Staff truly wonderful..... so helpful and polite. Donovan bar superb.... invited 16 friends to join us for drinks and it was a perfect place to meet and have pre dinner drinks
July 2017,Fine dinner experience in Hix Mayfair,Friendly welcome and efficient service. Relaxed atmosphere in Hix restaurant followed by a delicious meal chosen from a menu with a mouth watering choice of fine foods. Overall a most enjoyable evening helped by excellent service.
July 2017,Excellent supper,"Excellent supper in Hix, hugely helpful waiters and staff, who made you feel welcome the moment you walk in. I would recommend the prawn cocktail and sea trout.  I will be coming back again with friends, thank you for a memorable evening."
July 2017,Fantastic Hotel,"great service, fantastic room, great food from room service and the restaurant  and right  in the middle of the city overall a great experience and fantastic/helpful staff would definitely come back. ‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫"
July 2017,Mixing business with vacation,"My family and I recently stayed at this hotel.  I was in London on business and my family joined me to tour London.  You cannot choose a better hotel for service, accommodations, and location.  From the Doorman to the concierge to housekeeping to the rest of the staff, the people were friendly, and insightful in helping my family have a great experience in London.  Highly recommend."
May 2017,"Wonderful Staff, Wonderful Location...You will want to stay here when you're in London",What a wonderful experience my daughter and I had at Brown's Hotel. This was my daughter's first visit to London so we were out and about playing tourist. The hotel is conveniently located to many tourist attractions and shopping. The concierge and porter were very helpful in recommending places to visit. The high afternoon tea was amazing! and HIX Mayfair was wonderful!  We are looking forward to going back soon. 
June 2017,Crew,"The crew is excepcional all the times in all places. Te concierge crew are outstanding finding what ever you are looking for, no matter the difficulty. The Browns locattion y very good, near tube, theatre and important city points."
April 2017,Excellent,"Very charming place, and our primary London choice since many years. Charming and exclusive without being stuffy or arrogant. Nice atmosphere. Very cosy bar. Rooms are not large, but all you need is there. We stayed in a junior suite, and that gives you that bit of extra space - recommended. The location is wonderful, and you can walk to Bond Street, St. James, Oxford Street, Regent Street."
November 2016,Baby Shower,"I was ringing around different hotels regarding a tour around London whilst we stay! The telephone Operator Brenda was very professional and friendly which is very hard to get nowadays. She was very patient as I really wasn't sure what to ask for, she suggested I be put through to concierge who was very helpful I believe I spoke to a Paul! Who knew everything I requested! I felt safe knowing how helpful he was (Friendly Helpful Staff All Round)"
April 2017,Perfect!,"Our second stay at Brown's Hotel and it delivers in all aspects of a perfect stay.   The ambiance within the hotel is warm, friendly and you feel there is always someone more than happy to help if needed.   I couldn't fault the hotel and it lived up to my expectations from our previous stay without any trouble at all.  Perfect location and central to just about everything. The breakfast on offer is terrific.  The staff are amazing right from the concierges to the front desk staff. Having flown in a day later than my family they could tell it had been a long flight and it was late at night so they parked some of the usual check-in requirements until the morning.  Perfect!"
March 2017,Mid week,We decided to visit London and were recommended this hotel. Wow what a find the restaurant was amazing and the food great. The bedroom suite was massive and well equipped. The staff were all very professional we will be back

April 2017,Perfect Hotel,"I love this hotel.  It is a comfortable haven in the heart of London - a home from home with exceptional service from the staff. The rooms are scrupulously clean and the food is varied and delicious.  Just check in and let the staff handle your baggage.  In minutes, you can be looking at an exhibition at the Royal Academy or wandering down Burlington Arcade.  "
April 2017,Brown's always a pleasure,"Great service, always welcome. Love returning to the Browns in London. Perfect location. The concierge was so helpful in arranging a golf game at the Grove as well as reserving theater tickets for us and providing excellent info on trains etc."
April 2017,Excellent - as always,"We continue to come back to Brown's - when we are in London for pleasure. The explanations are simple: the staff and their attention, excellent breakfast and the bar rooms and: the most effective location. As frequent hotel enjoyers, We hope that the Brown concept will continue to deliver excellent value to us!"
March 2017,Fantastic afternoon tea at the English tea rooms,My family and I went for afternoon tea as we were celebrating our birthdays We ordered 3 tea-tox afternoon teas and 1 traditional afternoon tea the food was amazing the staff were lovely and the waiter who served us was fantastic  There was more than enough food and you could order more if you wanted  We had a very relaxed couple of hours and we were not rushed at all I would definitely go back again  Thank you for making our visit special
April 2017,Brown's - always pleasant,"Returning is always nice. Excellent service. Everything runs perfectly, but in a very relaxed and easy way. You are always welcome and there are never anything that cannot be solved. You want to come back and back"
April 2017,Fab For,"We only stayed one night and had Dinner out.  The Continental buffet breakfast we had was good.  The location is perfect for London, the Staff and Service wonderful and the room we had, King Executive, very comfortable. We only really dealt with Reception and Concierge and nothing was too much trouble for any of the team we met or contacted. Would highly recommend."
April 2017,great place in London,The best place to stay in town. The athmosphere is very British. Tradition and modernity. The service is impeccable. TH efood is excellent. The best tea room in London. Beatiful and spacious rooms. Great Experience.
April 2017,"A superb London hotel, with modern amenities and old-fashioned elegance","This is, simply stated, the best place to stay in London.  The staff could not be friendlier or more helpful, and, while the Hotel is not inexpensive, it is great value for the money. Centrally located in Mayfair, within easy walking distance of London Clubs, the West End Theater District, and the best shopping in the world."
April 2017,Posh,"We just walked in here for an early dinner at THE Browns Hotel not far from Bond Street. The  interior design was classic and POSH. There are some guest departments where you can have Afternoon  tea, and relax in the Lounge area which are all incredibly beautiful but the one we chose to go to was the HIX Restaurant. It was  breathtaking  with the wall half covered in wood. We thought this place while not cheap but you get a great selection of food and fantastic service. William was our Sicilian server who was very attentive and polite. We  absolutely loved the place and will definitely recommend to  anyone to go.  We haven't seen any rooms, etc. But  we can only  comment on the Dinner  experience. So nice to be here with my Welsh darling."
April 2017,Weekend visit,Old fashion courtesy and character within a busy capital city hotel is enhanced by its being positioned within easy walking distance of a plethora of shops that offer a wide choice for the discerning visitor. 
April 2017,Probably the best hotel we have stayed at in London,"Everything is excellent at Brown's including the staff, the room, the atmosphere, the food and the location which is really quiet. We will definitely stay there again. Having tried several top London hotels, this exceeds them all so far."
October 2016,perfect place to be in London Mayfair,"top hotel in the heart of London - we will always be back again. Comfortable, clean, well kept, familiar, lovely atmosphere, very friendly staff, nice breakfast, helpful concierge and porter, relaxed receptionist, an overall positive experience .................................................................................................. ................................................................................................................................................................................"
May 2016,Tea at Brown's Hotel,"Amazing!! My daughter's dream was to have a special tea time in London. Thank you Brown's Hotel for fulfilling her dream. The food was delicious and the ambience was perfect. Our server, Miguel, was extremely gracious. I recommend venue hands down.  SCP, NJ "
April 2017,London Stay,"Superb hotel as you would expect for London, the staff were just superb and very polite, helpfull, and made our stay really enjoyable, would def stay again, the location was very good too not far from the busy shops of Oxford Street, and Bond Street, the building itself was full of charm, will def be back  only one niggle was the people in the room ubove were like a herd of elephants till quite late and the  air condionting unit outside was quite noisey but apart from that very good indeed,,"
May 2016,A more subtle Grand hotel in London with disparities in its rooms,"Ditto, Brown's hotel belongs to the luxury hotel category of London and is conveniently located in Mayfair, but lacks some of the luxuries that its competitors offer (lobby, more restaurants, common grounds). Also, there are significant disparities between the rooms, even of rooms in the same category. On the other hand, you can get a better deal than in most other grand hotels of London. The first room that they showed us was unacceptable for an hotel of this class. Finally, we got a very nice room with nice king size bed (at a surcharge). I also have serious objections about the bathroom amenities by James Heeley. They are of very good quality and surprisingly large packing (100ml), but the scent (Fresh grass, Rhubarb, Fig Leaf, etc.) is debatably pleasant. I understand that‚Ä¶"
December 2016,British treat with class,"It's a perfect understated hotel without too much people coming and going. I stayed for a week and the place was all I needed. Not too much fuss from the staff but the choices available for both cocktails and afternoon tea.  Had several spa treatments which was nice, especially after long working days in London. Would go back for an all girls' weekend, but perhaps not the most romantic of choices. "
February 2017,Ultimate perfection ,I visited with my mum for a very special weekend break. From check in (personal and friendly) to afternoon tea - this hotel is in a league of its own. Luxurious without being pretentious and personable without being intrusive. Our room was beautiful - a bottle of champagne on ice and a plush teddy bear to greet us was such a thoughtful and generous gesture. Breakfast and dinner was impeccably served and the food was superb. We hope to return again. Special mention to the afternoon tea - the best we have ever sampled in the most salubrious setting. 
November 2016,Delicious Portland Crab and Torbay Dover sole,"Brown's is everything that one would hope for, and before London transmogrified from its British past, used to find in the best yet Mayfair hotels.   Calm and dignified, exquisite service with a really lovely interior.   The Hix restaurant has never failed to provided a most delicious lunch. The ingredients being good quality that is then wonderfully cooked.   Rooms are elegant and relaxed with none of the pretension of some of the more avant garde offerings.   Prices are such that if there is a need to ask of them in advance it might perhaps be best to consider and alternative. That said the prices are typical of central London's top establishments.   The bar is a real pleasure, providing a wide range of the better spirits, liqueurs, champagne etc and really well made‚Ä¶"
February 2017,Enjoyed the stay in this hotel,"I have been in this hotel for some times, it is always perfect. The old atmosphere you feel and the first class service gives you the impression that you stay at home. The rooms offer all the modern amenities, without being flashy and modern."
February 2017,Love this hotel,Stayed here a few times. Has that atmosphere of elegance and class. Love the stylish design and service was excellent and attentive.  Definitely recommend for its location in Mayfair and it's bar feels lively enough and trendy.   It's high price is justifiable I will choose this hotel above the Dorchester any day
February 2017,Best Hotel in London!,"I have stayed in London at a few of the top hotels and this is by far the best.  Fantastic rooms,  quiet location but central to everything.  Service was perfect in Hix, Donovans, Reception and Concierge.  Breakfast was perfect too.  All in all a great stay in a lovely hotel.  5 Star and more.   Left my car in valet parking and got a free tin in sweets on our departure.  Little touches like that make the difference!!!"
February 2017,LOVE the Brown's Hotel,Our go to hotel in London.The location is perfect and the staff is lovely.  Love that they improved their wifi - but I don't think that guests should have to pay extra for faster internet. It's a luxury hotel -- that should be part of the package. 
February 2017,Amazing Hotel,"There wasn't a time we were there and interacting with the staff that they didn't address us by name. They seemed genuinely happy to be working there and the location was amazing. Green Park tube station just a few blocks away. And the bar at the hotel, The Donovan Bar, makes amazing cocktails. Our room didn't have the greatest view but our studio suite was roomy and everything was taken care of for us each day. Would definitely recommend this Hotel and come back again. A great experience. "
January 2017,Sabine,"Very warm and welcome Hotel with exzellent Service, Food and very comfotable. Top located in the Heart of London. Quiet Roms and very clean. Breakfast is very good, Nice bar with excellent Drinks! Overall excellent "
February 2017,Escape,"My husband and I decided to have our first night away from the kids so we wanted to be pampered and have a little bit of luxury. Browns was exactly that. The hotel is exactly what you expect. Excellent, traditional service with beautiful interior. We loved Donavans Bar.. would we stay at Browns again? Most certainly. "
February 2017,Browns - Mayfair,"Excellent stay at classy Mayfair hotel. Reception and concierge as expected of a high end hotel. The overall feeling of class rather than glitz. Would definitely stay again. Great part of town, easy to walk to central attractions."
February 2017,quality!,"if you are looking for a small business meeting - that will be good place to start.  location is more the better: - 15 to 20 minutes for almost all London ""place to visit"" - parking is available for hotel guest and visitors as well, big bonus as to park a car there is a task"
February 2017,Great New Year at the Brown's Hotel,"A grand old hotel with a lot of history, our stayed over New Years Eve was made most memorable by all staff members that we met. Hospitality Professionals is a fitting title for what they do but, these professional at The Browns are the best we have ever had the privilege to meet. The hotel is very buttoned up and the service and help provided by staff was excellent always going the extra mile or kilometer (which ever measurement you choose). One example was on New Year's day. Up early and ready to go to the airport we were advised that our cab was p4rked 4 blocks from the hotel as the City was being prepared for a rather large New Year's Parade and the car could not drive to the hotel. No problem, 2 Brown's professionals walked us and our bags to the car without being asked.‚Ä¶"
February 2017,Shopping trip in London,"Nice and comfortable hotel the best place in London. Very friendly and helpful concierge ..  The room was large and comfortable, but only the view of the courtyard, the reason that it was a little dark.  The bed was very comfortable and the furniture nice, but I do not like rooms with carpet flooring. Overall 4 beautiful and relaxing days in a beautiful and very hospitable hotel."
February 2017,"Love this hotel! Super location, great service, great rooms!","We have stayed multiple times, we love this hotel. Location is unique, if one choses Mayfair. The rooms are large, cosy and beautifully decorated - one of the strong advantages of RoccoForte brand. Service is always great, very friendly and discreet. "
November 2016,Valentine's day at Brown's!,"We had an absolutely wonderful time at the hotel. Reception was very friendly and efficient, the room was comfortable and chic, we had drinks before the theatre in the tea room and a great breakfast next morning. The hotel had organised as requested lovely flowers and chocolates and added their own little treats which was sweet, in every sense! If you want great tradition and yet 21st century comfort and service then Brown's is the right place!"
February 2017,Excellent stay at Brown's for the BAFTAs,"I recently stayed at Brown's while traveling to London for he BAFTA awards ceremony. This was my first time staying at Brown's and I was very pleased with all aspects of the hotel. In fact, my only regret is that my trip was so short, I wasn't able to take full advantage of all the hotel had to offer. "
February 2017,Lush,From the moment you arrive at the front door until you leave you are treated with smiles kindness and non problem is too big or small for the excellent staff . Great in house dinning no matter time of night 
January 2017,Great Mayfair location with exceptional service,"Wonderfully appointed rooms, exceptional service from front desk, concierge, doorman, and restaurant staff. Great location in Mayfair. Tea room was perfect London experience. Breakfast was plentiful and service was friendly and professional. "
January 2017,Classic London High Tea,"Anyone who does business in London knows the importance of high tea.  Mayfair is known for the best of the best in high end Hotels.  My favorite by far, whether it's for business or pleasure, is Brown's Hotel.  The masculine decor is perfect to sip a sherry or scotch by the fire.  Move on to a lovely sampling of scones and sandwiches and round it all out with their exquisite dessert selection.  Each bite has developed flavors with traditional perspective.  Fresh ingredients, smart presentation, attentive staff."
January 2017,"Farewell, my lovely","I've been visiting brown's for over 15 years and it has always delighted me for its reserve, the quality of service  and it felt right. See previous reviews  Sadly, no more - the hotel feels cheap, cost- cutting and the service in the dining room and library are disappointing. Tables crammed too close together.   The tranquility and joy has gone out of the place.  The long- term manager has left and you can feel the space he has left behind.  It all comes down to leadership whatever the industry.  My husband enjoyed his breakfast- perhaps because some of the long serving staff are still working in the Morning.  But me I'm looking for a new place to stay."
January 2017,Excellent Traditional Hotel,"We arrived in the morning but the hotel had already set up our Junior Suite. We requested and received a quiet room on the courtyard. The room was comfortable and spacious. The only noise came from doors slamming on the hall, but I'm not sure they can do anything to remedy that and it only occurred one night. There was no street noise at all. Housekeeping was impeccable. The cold buffet is a solid offering. The only week link was the dinner at Hix, which I reviewed separately (too much pushing to upsell followed by an attempted overcharge). I recommend Brown's and would return."
January 2017,Just what you would expect....,"Wonderful hotel, great service, nice bar, wonderful breakfast, great location.  Only issue is the low price rooms have views of a lightwell and airconditioning ductwork, but this is probably a common problem in long standing city hotels."
January 2017,Best in London?,What a truly great hotel. The Brown's Hotel combines its glorious past and superb location with excellent staff and very comfortable accommodation. The bar is a treat and breakfast a morning highlight.  We'll be back.
January 2017,Excellent ,"From the moment we checked in we knew this would be a special stay.   Reception, Doorman, Porters, Barman, Restaurant Staff and everyone else are all second to none.  This is an excellent hotel and one we will return to.   Thank you. "
January 2017,"Excellent stay , wonderful hotel","Another fabulous stay at Browns Hotel , Excellent staff and stay and great location to Bond Street - Loved the suite we had and the bar is a wonderful experience - a must in London, and never disappoints ."
January 2017,Home from Home,"It's always a pleasure staying at Brown's. Comfortable accommodation, excellent and attentive staff,  great food and service. Never disappoints. Always sad to leave, but can't wait til we stay there again."
January 2017,Home away from home!,"This is a wonderful hotel in a terrific location. You will feel at home here. The staff could not be more friendly and attentive, our room and bathroom were splendid, just stay away from the afternoon tea which is outrageously priced!"
January 2017,Weekend stay in London,"Chose Browns for a overnight stay in London and visit to the Arts Club across the road + Great Hotel, perfect location, top if you are looking for a cosy hotel with a warm boutique-hotel feeling. Not a classical ""grand hotel"" setting like the Ritz  + Breakfast: supreme quality, few choices at the continental menu but trade-off for quality is worth it + Location, location, location  "
November 2016,Business with Diana,"Brown's Hotel, centrally located, in London is a 5 star hotel with all the great amenities. Great staff and internal restaurant..(Mayfair)..  This hotel is part of the Rocco Forte chain from Europe..wonderful place."
December 2016,Very nice afternoon tea at Browns,"Visited as part of a 50th birthday celebration and found the whole experience very enjoyable.  This is certainly not going to be the cheapest place you will drink tea and eat sandwiches, but it will pro a lay be one of the most enjoyable?  Upon arrival coats and bags were put in the cloakroom and we were shown to our table. Pianist playing away in the background.  A fine selection of teas for all tastes were offered, along with a tray of sandwiches, which were replenished each time you finished them. Next was scones, cream and jam and cakes.  A very nice treat, nothing could be faulted.  "
January 2017,Attention to detail,"A truly beautiful intimate hotel within the heart of Mayfair. A tasteful fusion of traditional and modern. The service is outstanding. Every single member of staff within the hotel proved attentive and that makes all the difference be it a one night stay or a week. I would absolutely recommend a stay here, and as a result am now keen to discover some of the other Rocco Forte hotels worldwide."
January 2017,feeling at home,"We allways enjoy our stay at Brown's. Everyone is very friendly, concierges very usefull and housekeeping staff very atentive. The restaurant offers gluten free food which is vital for our sun who is allergic and the quality is exceptional. "
January 2017,5 * Trually,"Visited Browns hotel with my husband and everything about it is amaizing, its so conviniently located in the heart of London. Everything was simply amaizing from the service, welcome, the rooms to the afternoon tea with the lovely victoria sponge cakes.  Trually a 5* start hotel. "
January 2017,Best Boutique Hotel in London,"I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. It is a small hotel with an emphasis on service. It has a great location in the mayfair / piccadilly area with easy access to the tube. The staff makes a point to know each and every guest. They are truely interested in making your stay and visit perfect. They will help with any booking or reservation.   For example, I was having trouble booking tickets to a local attraction. We mentioned it to the concierge as we were walking to breakfast. He secured the reservation and brought the tickets to our table before we finished our meal.    Yanick (Yannis) in dinning provided the most exceptional service. He knew our favorite drinks / coffees by the second day. We felt like family by the end of our trip. He truly cared about our family‚Ä¶"
January 2017,Exceptional,"The hotel is beautiful, the mix of modern art and traditional furniture and fixtures is seamless. The service is outstanding - charming, warm and friendly staff. You feel truly spoilt staying here. Could not recommend it more."
January 2017,Very Good With Great Service,"I have stayed at this hotel several times, with the most recent stay on January 14, 2017.  An upgraded room was ready and waiting for me when I arrived (I was staying on a free Leading Hotels of the World night award).  Staff were great, housekeeping was great.  Room was spotless.  Only issue I bed it too soft and low to floor.  Did not seem like a true king bed, possibly two twins put together.  Other than this issue, this is a quality hotel with a great location.  They go above and beyond.  I will be back again on February 17 - hope for a firmer bed, but otherwise expect a great stay.  "
December 2016,"Superior Hotel, Staff, Stay","Exceptional one night stay. The welcome, check-in and at check-out was charm and efficiency. We had drinks at the Donovan bar and Afternoon Tea - both of which are at the top of comparable experiences (eg Claridges Tea and Conaught Bar) in terms of quality and service. Exceptional hotel and staff. "
January 2017,London is the best!,"I stayed at Brown's Hotel in my last trip to London. The location is amazing, the service was perfect and my room (junior suite) was very comfortable. All the staff was very friendly and did their best to improve our stay."
December 2016,Teatime Treat,"Marvellous! Visited this lovely hotel for afternoon tea during the festive period and was delighted with everything. Our table was sited very close to the piano(lovely musical accompaniment to tea!) in a comfortable lounge area with a lovely log fire blazing in the grate. After a pleasant welcome from helpful staff, we were shown to our table and soon afterwards our orders were taken.  Tea started off with a delicious beetroot and ginger seasonal drink- quite warming considering how cold it was outdoors! The sandwiches and savoury treats were excellent, so too the warmed scones served with clotted cream and homemade strawberry jam. Then a blood orange jelly palate cleanser arrived(also delicious) followed by an array of beautifully presented cakes and pastries. The tea pots were‚Ä¶"
December 2016,Perfect Party!,"We had a 2 night break here including a private dinner to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday - it couldn't have been any better. Brown's was the perfect location for our celebration - a lovely private dining room, excellent service from the first moment we arrived to our departure and the best food possible.The entire weekend was fabulous and we can't thank the staff there enough for all their hard work. If you have a special occasion to celebrate it will be extra special if you choose Brown's Hotel."
December 2016,THE best afternoon tea in town!,"Browns afternoon tea is memorable for all the right reasons...I really could wax lyrical, but having toured a few of the 'best' venues in London, this just wins hands down, for us. Classy, exclusive, world-class service, food, beverages, music and ambience. Just go, and message us if you disagree!"
December 2016,Shoot,"Perfect loacation, great food, helpful staff bar the front of house who was cold and unhelpful. Quick service of anything we needed. Suite was lovely size if not a bit dark and a strange picture above the desk."
January 2017,Wonderfully¬†comfortably luxurious place,"The staff at Brown's hotel has a talent for taking care of you without bothering you.  It's hard to explain how subtle and attentive they are. ¬†I felt watched over without being intruded upon.  It's efficient¬†in a relaxing way.  The hotel is comfortable and¬†cozy while still fancy.  I will absolutely come back here the next time I'm in London.  The location is unparalleled, the rooms are spacious and well-designed, it's a great¬†place."
January 2017,A very good year end,"A very good location an good services and installations, nice room and bed, allows a pleasant  days in London,  Staff are very helpful, and the restaurant and breakfast used high quality foods. you will feel more in your house than in a hotel   "
December 2016,Superior London Hotel,"Exceptional... what more is there to say. It is our choice of the many London Hotels and restaurants if you are seeking pretension, reception and communal areas like an airport arrivals lounge, this isn't a place for you.  A hotel where Churchill could enjoy a beverage or two and reflect on his day.. we are still doing the same!"
December 2016,Brown's London,Fabulous hotel in excellent location. We particularly enjoyed the bar which had live entertainment while we were there. Staff are very helpful and really want you to enjoy your stay. Our room was large in comparison to other London hotels in which we have stayed.
December 2016,Superb Afternoon Tea!,"I can't think of a better way to spend New Years Day, than by having Afternoon Tea at Browns Hotel.  What a wonderful experience my husband and I had. The ambience in the tea room was lovely, with the pianist tinkling the ivories in the background. All the staff were friendly, but also completely courteous and professional.   The Afternoon Tea was simply superb, excellent choice of teas which were poured for us, then the selection of sandwiches, mini rolls, and bagels with delicious fillings and toppings. After a second round of savouries, we were then plied with warm scones and exquisite patisserie, which were absolutely to die for!   We had expectations, and I must say they were well and truly exceeded. All in all, a truly wonderful afternoon. Many, many thanks!"
December 2016,A Great Stay in London,"The Brown's Hotel is the place to be!  The staff was incredible and made us feel right at home, especially with our two children (5 & 7). The concierge team was very knowledgeable and made booking things a breeze. The other hotel staff was a delight to be around and very accommodating. The location is one of the best in London as well. A must when visiting London!"
November 2016,Wonderful City Hotel,"Wonderful city hotel and for london standards big rooms. Good price for Christmas time. Very nice breakfast selection and very friendly staff. Cozy tea room atmosphere and bar. Perfect location for piccadilly, soho, regent street and bond street!!"
December 2016,Excellent,"The location of hotel is very good for shopping, meals and theaters. All the staff of the hotel are kind and friendly. I want to use it when I next stay in London. I would like to recommed this hotel to my friends."
December 2016,Understated elegance in the heart of London,"Excellent stay in this exquisite hotel.  The attention to detail is second to none and we were made to feel extremely welcome, looked after and part of the ""family"".  Even the doorman who hailed our taxi knew our name.  The service was faultless, non-pompous and friendly.  Concierge were exceptional in managing excellent restaurant recommendations, managing car pickups and last minute changes.  "
November 2016,Overall a first class experience!,"When traveling to London, you have a lot of hotel options. And we have stayed at many. Brown's Hotel may be the best. Located in Mayfair, the hotel has an unassuming entry - but once inside you are quickly impressed with the level of service and intimate engagement. If you read my other reviews, you know I'm not easily satisfied. Brown's makes you feel right at home and in the cradle of luxury. The suites are impeccably appointed with amazing bathrooms and comfy beds. I can pick apart almost any hotel stay but I have a hard time finding any fault with Brown's. From the concierge, who chased reservations during a busy time of year to the front desk staff that worked hard to handle my many requests, the entire stay was a true joy. Thank you Brown's for making our trip a great‚Ä¶"
November 2016,Fabulous stay,Had a wonderful time as always at Browns. Classy and Fabulous with the best staff. Cannot wait to be back and enjoy the hotel again. You can't beat it. Perfect location and rooms are incredible - enjoy!!
November 2016,London at it's best,"I read a quote that I can only confirm emphatically. ""I do not stay in a hotel, I stay at the Brown's"". Excellent service, familiarly, my children were given really good attantion, etc. I've stayed at many good hotels in Mayfair, but this is one of the best."
November 2016,A Real Gem!,"I nearly gave Brown's a 4* review, due to the very high cost of staying here, but that seemed somewhat unfair, as that's London for you. I arrived on foot (Green Park Tube is just around the corner) and was greeted at the door, my bag taken, and escorted to reception. Check-in was very smooth and I was allocated a Classic Room - 211. It's next to the lift, but I was not disturbed in any way with noise from the corridor and the hotel was fully booked. No view, but as I secured the room at an extremely favourable rate, I wasn't expecting one. The receptionist showed me the features in the room and also pointed out a hot water safety feature on the bath taps.  Lost of nice touches in the room (bathrobes, selection of different amenity kits, full sized shower gel) and not long after‚Ä¶"
November 2016,Experience of several stays,"We have stayed at this hotel for several years, at least once  a year. Though it is a five star hotel it gives you the feeling of home - the take care of you and no task is impossible! Location is great."
November 2016,Very good location and helpful staff.,"If you go to London for business, leasure or, specially, shopping, thesis your hotel. Excel.lent staff ready to help and service. The only thing to reclaim is the quality of wifi. at least in our executive room. and, because it's an old renewed building, a little difficult to find your room as it has a lot of stairs and corners. anyway, very recomendable hotel (with a healthy credit card!). Thanks."
November 2016,"Excellent, small and cosy","Good attitude of all the personnal. Quiet and clean rooms. Hix restaurant : very British and excellent foot and wine. An overall charming hotel and location. Attentive staff, starting at the entrance, ending boy leaving the hotel.... "
November 2016,Pampering hotel stay in Mayfair,We are more than pleased with our stay at Brown¬¥s. The location was perfect on a quiet street. The service was excellent and we slept like babies in the comfortable beds. Small luxury details through the entire stay such as housekeeping preparing the beds while we where out for dinner. We will definitely be back.
November 2016,Great Hotel in a great location,Was a great weekend at Brown's. It is so convenient to have a base in the heart of Mayfair. Rooms are nice and quiet. Service is great. The Bar astonished me with a large selection of Gin which I loved. We will be back
December 2016,Birthday treat!,"Exemplary welcome, service and room..we felt relaxed and at home from the moment we arrived....beautiful hotel...thank you for making us feel special...we will be back and will be sure to recommend Browns to all!"
December 2016,Family visit Nov 2016,"Did not live up to its usual flawless service. In the past the welcome to our family has been fantastic. A few things were missing this time, which could be considered minor but which actually set apart Browns from other hotels."
December 2016,Unforgettable Stay with fantastic staff,"It started with a very warm welcome at the door and continued with an excellent and friendly check-in at this beautiful located hotel. They showed us the whole property and introduced the staff while going to our room. It was super clean and we had everything we needed. Especially the friendly and very helpful concierge team (Thanks David) created a perfect start to the trip with the hotel car to a recommended sushi restaurant! All in all, we had a great time and would definatly come back for any other London trip in the future. Thanks to all...!!"
December 2016,My first time at Browns, usually stay at claridge's but was unable this time have eaten in HIX restaurant many times So this was my first time I have stayed in Browns 's was very impressed from the moment I arrived great service I stayed on fourth floor over looking courtyard lovely room all the staff were a credit to  this hotel  goodbye claridge's now will be staying at Browns.'s in future 
December 2016,Missing the little things,"My wife kindly booked a weekend here for my 50th and the hotel promised to deliver a great experience down to the tiny things. In truth they did well but still fell somewhere short. Despite being told that our daughter was a mature 12 year old they still decorated the kids room like she was a 12 month old! When we arrived at 1500 our rooms were not ready and we were forced to come back 15 minutes later - an inauspicious start. Service at breakfast on the Sat was slow to say the least (which was addressed on the Sunday) but the food quality was not what we had expected. The bacon sandwich on the Sunday had little more than a hint of meat! A great weekend was had, but the hotel didn't contribute as much as it should have."
November 2016,Brown's nice location but not Claridge's,Brown's was surprisingly pleasant except we did not have hot water and we could not shower before getting on an 8 hour flight.  The staff should have been more forthcoming and offered to reduce our bill.
November 2016,"Great Location, Fantastic Hotel","A truly fantastic hotel - in an excellent location. The staff really go out of their way to make you feel at home - in a very genuine way. I was very impressed! The location is also excellent as you are within walking distance of so much, be it: shopping; restaurants; bars; musicals; theatres; museums or many of the main tourist attractions.    "
November 2016,One of the best hotels!,"Absolutely a top hotel - from professional and friendly staff, to superb location, to wonderful 'home-like' pampering during the stay, they make you feel like royalty when you're there. We come back all the time!"
October 2016,Nice place to stay,We were upgraded from a room to a suite which was impressive. The suite was lovely although there was a bit of a smell of cigarettes! Staff were welcoming and friendly. Very expensive but it was in Mayfair!
October 2016,Total disappointing for loyalty,"I was staying at Browns: 29th of November 2016 till 03 of December 2016. Booking procedure by phone was nice and smooth , person in charge introduced as Roberta, she looked in  my profile and deluxe room was booked with preferences ; view on Albermarle street. (i gess it's gonna be 4  time for me to stay at Browns, if am wrong hotel stuff will amend me), as well promised  to do everything to allow me to check in to room early then 15.00  due to early time of my flight. So I arrived at hotel at 14.40  room wasn't ready,i was offered cup of tee for fee, (flight from frozen Moscow was delayed and difficult) Person on reception kindly asked my credit card to frozen some amount for expected  expenses , which is rather unpleasant thing , because if you not using hotel facilities and‚Ä¶"
October 2016,Excellent,"Location, property, service vet excellent  Worker, housekeeping, laundry, dry cleaning, bed sheets, pelow, food beverages was excellent, experienced staff always smiling, door man very nice , concerige well experienced "
October 2016,Brilliant,"Spending a night in Brown's Hotel has been a long-term dream of mine since having afternoon tea there in 1990. I have such wonderful memories and photos of that day that I actually chided myself for setting myself up for disappointment as nothing could be as wonderful as my memory of it. At least I thought so, but I was happily mistaken. Much has changed since that long-ago afternoon and the atmosphere is quite different but I liked it. Brown's have their own next door florist in Ellie Hartley (ELH) and her artful arrangements of hydrangeas dominated the public spaces giving this venerable  hotel a modern vibe.  Our room was small but very well appointed and the bathroom was fabulous. Everyone treated us very well and we loved celebrating our birthdays with a formal tea and a‚Ä¶"
October 2016,London Home Away From Home,"Browns is responsible for making London my favorite city to visit.  Most central location, chic amazingly comfortable rooms, fantastic bar and restaurant and the warmest most professional staff that make you want to move in. Hard to even leave the hotel once in London and a place of solace during any busy trip. Classic, elegant, tasteful and cool. I hope it never changes.  "
October 2016,Short Stay Fam visit,"We spent 1 night at the Brown's Hotel. What a wonderful and unforgettable experience. Wish we would have had more time to enjoy this wonderful Hotel. The hotel has elegant , tasteful, historical influences. You will not get tired to browse around discovering new details and art-I-facts throughout. The Donovan Bar makes for bustling experience of award winning Cocktails. The Hotel Restaurant and Food  The Hix , we enjoyed the best brunch ever with exceptional waiting staff. The Brown's offered first class service ,yet making us feel like family with their very warm and friendly staff. Thank you again for your excellent service."
March 2016,A Plesant Surprise in the Heart of Mayfair,Great location in the heart of Mayfair one block from New Bond street. Easy walk to Oxford Street and all the great restaurants in Mayfair. Older buildings turned into a hotel decades ago lead to slight differences in floor levels so you have two steps up here and four down there. The rooms are bright and airy and as it is on a side street the car noise is minimal. The front desk staff is very professional and the concierges really do know all the 'in' restaurants and can actually get you a reservation. Great bar for a quiet drink.
October 2016,High tea at its best,"My daughter, her friend and I had high tea and it was excellent. We have had high tea in many places and countries, this ranks among the best we have ever had. It may indeed be the best!   The food was plentiful, tasty and a wonderful variety. The egg salad, salmon and corned beef sandwiches were exceptional. The scones were to die for and the the only slightly less amazing dessert treats were all delicious. The tea varieties were varied and exceptional.  Highly recommend this classic English high tea in an old world setting!"
October 2016,Short London stay,"My wife and I over-nighted in London and spent 1 night at Brown's.  I wish we had scheduled more time.  The hotel is elegant.  The staff is very warm and friendly.  And, the location off of Piccadilly and Bond Street is excellent.  The concierge picked the perfect restaurant for us and made the reservation on such short notice that I'm convinced he is a magician(or at least extremely influential.)    The bar in the evening was lively and very comfortable and a good place to relax before dinner.  The hotel is definitely an A+ for anyone needing luxury accommodations in London."
October 2016,Personalised service Hotel ,"Great hospitality, service and food. Second home feeling every time we go. Rooms are spacious and clean. Room service is quick. They always remember you. Staff is always helpful and friendly. And their consistency is remarkable."
September 2015,Classic hotel with style,"I've been there during a business trip and my stay was great. Very good located, easy accessible the staff was very professional and the breakfast was great. The style is traditional with contemporary touches. Very beautiful the bar and the breakfasts room. "
August 2016,Good of enough for Winston...,"Lovely boutque hotel in London that was apparently one of Churchill's favorites. Very great location in Mayfair area (especially if you want to shop in high-end shops).  Front desk and concierge team were terrific.  Room was nicely appointed, although mine was a bit small.  Nice size bathroom.  Breakfast expensive and not as good as I remembered."
August 2016,London at its best ,"What a lovely stay and so much joy for kids and adults a like! very detail oriented house and staff. Most comfortable beds! Little things as give aways for the kids made them so happy! Location great for trips, shops and tube. Definetly coming back!"
July 2016,we love Browns!,"Our second stay here. We love the 5 star yet friendly and approachable service. The hotel has a traditional yet contemporary feel that is very inviting. The location is excellent for shopping, dining, sightseeing. Kudos to General manager Stuart Johnson who is hands on and runs this finely tuned hotel !"
August 2016,Perfect!,"The first time I came to Browns' was five years ago when a close friend celebrated his wedding here. It would only be 3 years until I would experience staying here. I'm so glad I finally did for my 28th birthday thanks to my parents. A week to remember. This place is situated in the heart of the city and is easy to commute and from any airport.  The staff assigned to your suite is always only a call away, ready to serve you and your friends at a drop of a hat.  There is nothing these warm people won't do to make your stay that little bit more special. Enjoy the breakfast in your room or go downstairs for brunch or tea.  If you enjoy staying in style then I strongly recommend staying at least a long weekend."
August 2016,"Great location, but I expected more in my room for the money","This property is very well located for shopping. We were not interested in seeing the museums and common tourist sites. Been there and done that. This one's all about the location. After just having stayed at another Rocco Hotel, the Hotel de Rome in Berlin, I was a bit disappointed. Our room paled in comparison. I guess it's London. This should be what I expected. The service and amenities were equally exceptional. Not sure I would stay there again unless we upgrade to a suite or ask to see more rooms. We were offered the opportunity to look at other rooms on our arrival, but we were tired and just wanted to get checked in. We'll know better if we return."
August 2016,Perfect afternoon tea.,"Booked this hotel for afternoon tea has it had been recommended to me several times and we were not disappointed; faultless.    We arrived and were shown to our table, we went with the traditional afternoon tea.  We went for a bottle of champagne to share on the side.  There were plenty of teas/flavours to pick from.  We went for the Cornish tea and it was nice, suited the afternoon tea well.   The lounge was very comfortable and plenty of space to relax.  A member of staff was playing the panio which really set the atmosphere.   The food was perfect. The cakes and pastries were yummy! Plenty of food.    The staff were all very polite.  The service was first class. We felt very looked after and I honestly can't find any faults with anything."
July 2016,Best location excellent service ,The location is quite yet near everything.  The services was amazing the concierge was extremely helpful specially David. Helped us with hiring baby sitter and book the best restaurants on short notice.  Very friendly with my children.  They have the best doorman.  I would definitely recommend it. 
July 2016,Excellent hotel,Excellent hotel and service. Quietly understated. Best pot of tea in London! We stayed for 2 nights and had a lovely relaxing time there. Staff went out of their way to assist and were very welcoming. As I would expect from a Rocco Forte hotel.
July 2016,London in a rush,"A perfect place. All the staff very helpful. Very close to all the important stores. Restaurant was very very good. Bed extremely clean. The shower, by far, the best in town. To be honest I do not have any recomendation because everything worked out very well.  Many thanks"
July 2016,Special Hotel in a Special Part of London,"Recently attended a business meeting at the Brown's Hotel and stayed in the hotel for three nights. It was an extraordinary pleasure - beautiful room, attentive staff and great food! The surrounding area - Mayfair is lovely - very London like and with lots of services, restaurants and retail. Excellent for walks after dinner. This is a very special hotel! I highly recommend the Brown's Hotel."
June 2016,recent stay,"very quiet room - perfectly presented. All of the staff were very helpful, all the time. ambience great as are the facilities. Restaurant good with great food and fine wine selection. Location great for the west end. London is expensive which is why value for money is less than other cities - would i change it, no !"
July 2016,Weekend in Mayfair,Very nice small hotel with excellent customer service. I would definitely recommend to anyone staying in west end/Mayfair to stay there. Great location and exceptional value compared to equivalent hotels in the area.
June 2016,a wonderful hotel,"Brown's is a great hotel, with excellent staff, fabulous service, excellent location etc. I particularly liked the breakfast room/ HIX restaurant, our room looked towards Bond St so could hear the carillon being played there on Saturday afternoon"
June 2016,A special long week end,"Excellent stay, wonderful breakfast and congratulations to all the staff  for the courtesy and kindness. Impeccable service, great attention to the customer and his needs. It will definitely be considered for a future stay in London."
September 2015,Weekend in London,From the minute we walked into the hotel until we left we had a wonderful experience staying with you. We visited the same time last year and were not disappointed this year. The services you offer from the Concierge to the valet service are excellent. Breakfast was enjoyable the service and food. We will definitely come again next year.
December 2015,Great comfortable boutique hotel,"Comfortable beds with high quality linens, great bathroom, fab bar- the Donovan - in prime location. Service excellent . The gym was also perfect. Breakfast healthy and delicious. Understated and chic. Not cheap  but worth it We loved it !!  "
June 2016,Feel at home in London,"Browns in London is the perfect recipe for warm, genuine service, great location , quiet street and excellent  restaurant . I wouldn't stay in any other hotel in London. The mood in the hotel is understated and not pretentious. You will feel like you're an old friend coming to stay at ""your home"" while in town.Newer hotels may be more elegant, but the true warmth of the staff will encourage  you to want to return."
June 2016,Happy Reflections,"Excellent food, wine  and service.   Efficient and attentive waiters.    Courteous and welcoming staff, Very satisfactory service from housekeeping staff  it is well worth a visit.  We hope to come again in the very near future."
June 2016,Wonderful,"We had a wonderful time here. Everything was fine, the staff was welcoming - though some should work on paying more attention to their guests' needs. ;) Beverages and food were excellent and quite tasty."
May 2016,Timeless and elegant,"I stayed here with my mum in December and it was perfection - a stones throw from my favourite - Old Bond Street and the hustle and bustle - yet you could be in Victorian England.   Food, service and aesthetic all wonderful - we had hoped to go to Hix but couldn't fit in.   Look forward to returning. "
June 2016,My favourite place,The Hotel is in the best location to art galleries and auction places as well as the Royal Academy of art and in the heart of the Fashion mile. The Hotel has the glamour of old tradition and is a very well run place for business but also leisure. My home in London. 
June 2016,Perfect place,Great location Lovely staff Amazing breakfast Relaxed environment near best shopping area. In the thick of things without feeling the hustle bustle of Bond street or Oxford streets. Staff was so efficient and helpful with reservations taxis etc. 
May 2016,Special occassion,For personal service and attention to detail the hotel and facilities could not be faulted.  Relaxed casual atmosphere makes one feel very at home. Prime London location makes staying in the capital a pleasure. 
May 2016,I don't think it gets any better!,"This place is amazing.  All of the rooms are tastefully appointed and allow you to relax and feel like home (as much as you can in a hotel).    The bar, tea room and restaurant are wonderful but I think that what stood out for me was the service as well as the location.  You are so close to so much in the City - Bond Street is minutes away, as are Regent, Oxford and Piccadilly.   The people are also terrific - every single one.  Lee at the Concierge provided an excellent dinner recommendation and the Valet is always helpful with any requests you have.  It's a definite splurge but if you can swing it you should experience this at least once.  I'm glad I did.  I was initially shown a room that faced one of the streets but I know that the traffic and occasional sirens would have‚Ä¶"
May 2016,Simply THE BEST!,"From its perfect location to the rooms decorated with such taste and understated elegance, this hotel is truly special.  The touch of modernity is just right that preserves the old charm of the building and provides  a state-of-the-art amenities at the same time.  Would not think of staying elsewhere anywhere in this entire city."
May 2016,Best Hotel in London,"I travel to London 3/4 times a year. I have stayed in many hotels. What sets The Browns ahead is it excels in Service. Everyone is fantastic from the Doorman to the Front Desk. All in between are Top Notch. The Donavon Bar is a great place to meet friends and enjoy a cocktail or nightcap. Ask for Ronnie. Best mixologist around. The rooms are quiet and beautifully appointed. A full retreat in the City. Above all The Browns Hotel is simply put the most Centrally located Hotel in Central London. You could not ask for a better location. You are mins from all of London's major attractions, shopping and  culinary fare of Mayfair. I would recommend this Hotel hands down to everyone!"
May 2016,Amazing afternoon tea,"I visited for afternoon tea for my birthday and really enjoyed it: Excellent service, lovely food, very relaxing. The staff couldn't have been more helpful- it was a pleasure to be there. They brought as many refills as we requested and it was a thoroughly lovely afternoon. I would highly recommend it."
May 2016,a perfect stay in not just a hotel,"I am visiting London about 8 times a year and Brown's is just the perfect spot as a base for Sales Calls in the city. Right at Green Park, with the best tube connections, nice and luxury rooms, very friendly and attentive staff. This time was once again perfect. Thank you everyone. I will be back..."
May 2016,Proper English five star Experience with an Italian twist!,The Brown's Hotel is a wonderful experience with all the amenities you'd expect of a proper five star property. The staff was attentive to every detail from the point we arrived until we left. They were very helpful with logistics too and finding us a wonderful afternoon tea as the hotel was booked. We felt like we were the only ones there with all the attention we received. Feels very Italian too as the property is owned by Rocco Forte out of Italy. Bar tenders were fantastic too (Peter and Ronnie) and make great old school drinks as well as cutting edge cocktails. You will spend some coin but it is well worth every pound!  Enjoy!
May 2016,Best of the best in London,"In a city full of great hotels this is a stand out. We had an excellent and spacious room, a wonderfully comfortable bed and terrific - and flexible -  service from all the staff. From the time of our arrival it seemed that most of them knew our name. The location is of course superb"
June 2016,ExcELLENT,"Excellent service, terrific location-close to many excellent restaurants, shops, casino, sights etc.Concierge was so helpful and attentive. Room 224 was delightful-nice comfortable seating area, excellent bathroom-separate shower and tub, two sinks etc. "
June 2016,High Tea at the Browns Hotel,"We had a wonderful afternoon of High Tea at the Browns. Our server, Mohammed was attentive and wonderful.  The food:  sandwiches cakes and scones was fantastic. This is a must for anyone who wants to experience a true British tradition."
June 2016,Tea at browns,"Although it is expensive, the service, the ambiance. And the food are well worth the price we had our choice of different levels of tea. Service.  It is not necessary to have the most expensive,  the least expensive will give an average appetite mother than enough to eat, especially the scones and clotted cream.  And don't forget to ask for more if you want to."
June 2016,Wonderful in every way,"5 star in every way , true English style and elegance and welcoming throughout. Plus the beds are something else , and the breakfast was to die for. For anyone wanting luxury in a great location and a truly relaxed experience."
June 2016,Perfection personified,"Great location, great staff, great service, just great, great, great. Not a single flaw in service at this wonderful hotel. Cannot recommend highly enough. The hotel staff were truly impeccable -- they are all to be highly commended."
June 2016,Fabulous Stay at Brown's,We stayed at Brown's Hotel for 2 nights on a trip to Ascot.  We were looked after very well and would recommend a stay to any of our friends. The service is great and the atmosphere welcoming and sincere.  The Donovan Bar is lively and friendly and the HIX Restaurant is superb.
May 2016,Business Trip,"Excellent location and friendly helpful staff.  The standard room was very nice albeit no views.  Its and expensive stay but you do get what you pay for.  I used the gym and it was a little small, with only very standard equipment. "
May 2016,Wonderful,"Every aspect of my stay at Browns was perfect. You are made to feel so welcome, the rooms are amazing with lots of little extra touches that make you feel special. All of the staff were happy and very willing to help in anyway possible. The breakfast one of the best. Well done."
May 2016,Perfect Service,We had an event in the Brown¬¥s Hotel and everything was perfect organized and we all had a great experience in London. We are looking forward to stay again in this beautiful located Hotel with it¬¥s amazing services. 
April 2016,Afternoon Tea at the Brown's English Tea Room,"English decor, comfy chairs, yummy tea, relaxed atmosphere, delicious little sandwiches and sweets, beautiful piano music plaid live. We enjoyed wonderfully relaxing 2 hours at the Brown's English Tea Room and when we left we had full bellies and happy faces. I can only recommend to come with an empty stomach."
April 2016,Fantastic all around experience,"Browns Hotel enjoys a perfect location in Mayfair....excellent pubs in the immediate area and restaurants of all varieties at your disposal.  Easy access to lots of site seeing.  The concierge staff sees to your every need and we particularly enjoyed the service provided by the housekeeping staff - very clean room and very nice turn down service.  Probably won't stay anywhere else in London.  Oh and a nice bar, good service and the live music was a nice touch."
May 2016,Just the best,"This hotel is wonderful. Truly a find. It is elegant without being ostentatious. The best thing about it is the service. Everyone was so lovely and helpful. Best of all they were the opposite of stuffy, as some 5 star hotels feel compelled to be. The beds and pillows were heavenly. Everyone in my group commented on how fantastic they were. The location is fantastic as well. Brown's will be my standard for London."
May 2016,One of the best hotel in London,From i arrived i was treated very special and the employees were the best.  They pamper to  your every needs. I would recommend  this hotel to anyone visting London. The staff was professional. And the room was exceptional.
May 2016,A hidden gem,"Brown's Hotel in London's Mayfair may not be the first Hotel name that pops into your head when looking for a luxury stay in central London.  People tend to have heard of The Ritz, Grosvenor House, Claridges &The Dorchester and those names seem to come to mind first.  The owners of Browns Hotel would not mind that they are not the first on your list but they would be upset if you overlooked them altogether.  I suggest that you would be upset if you overlooked them.  This fine Hotel which opened it's doors in 1837 is for the discerning traveller who wants comfort and excellence and is not minding the pennies.  The selection of Rooms and Suites are First Class and as a Dining experience it is unparalleled.  It is not the largest London five star Hotel and that to is in it's‚Ä¶"
May 2016,Magnificent location.  Extremely friendly staff and all in all a wonderful experience!,First time I have stayed in London with my mum and my two daughters.  Everyone was extremely helpful.  Their attention to detail was superb - especially the gluten free breakfast they made for my daughter
June 2016,Excellent Hotel!,"From start to finish the hotel met all my expectations. This was my first time staying at the hotel and certainly won't be my last! All staff provided excellent service, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the hotel to anyone.   I ate at HIX restaurant.  Dinner and desert were absolutely fabulous.  The restaurant has a cozy, intimate feel to it being right in the heart of the city.  Afternoon tea was a delight! Scones served hot right out of the oven and the tea room is a beautiful room with comfortable chairs.    I have experienced massages all over the world and the hotel spa was one of the best.  Staff were so professional and friendly and I couldn't recommend them higher.  Don't waste your time looking for another hotel, book right away!  Nisha"
June 2016,Not in class of Ritz or 51 Taj bucking ham gate.,The hotel is bang opposite the ritz and has excellent service. Very helpful and service is 10 out of 10. The rooms are small and almost have no view. It is leading hote of the world. Breakfast was nice .
June 2016,Week-end In London,Excellent week-end at the Browns. Always a pleasure to stay there. The service at the Browns was excellent as always!! I always choose Rocco Forte hotels during my city trips because the service is always perfect!!
June 2016,Perfect,Excellent hotel in every way (the only comment is that the duvet (down filling) was a little too thick). Everything else was perfect. This hotel has everything we want and could possibly need. From now on will definitely stay here everytime we travel to London.
May 2016,Superb hotel,Wonderful hotel with incredibly friendly efficient staff who are always will to assist with anything needed and who always provide a really personal service.  Always stay here if I get the opportunity to do so.
May 2016,Diasppointed,"We had stayed there many years ago and were looking forward to the return visit. We were very disappointed. Room was average at best, bath was nice. Service in the bar was poor. Obviously a place for the locals."
April 2016,Great experience,"My travel agent recommend the hotel and she was right! It is a very nice hotel, great staff, friendly and very attentive. It is very well located in London. I would highly recommend it and definitely come back next time in London. Thank you all for a really nice time!!!"
May 2016,London's First Hotel,Everything tip-top.  What mainly interested me was the history of the hotel (est. 1837) and the famous guests that had stayed there.  The fact that everything else was top-notch was the icing on the cake - highly recommended.  
May 2016,Very classy small hotel - London done right. ,"Very clean, super skilled staff, awesome food and a great London experience. Would definitely stay here again.   The room 521 was a tidy interesting room overlooking typical rooftops. The neighborhood was super convenient to high end shopping and some great restaurants. "
May 2016,Intimate hotel in wonderfully convenient location,We could not have had a better stay. The hotel staff was exceptional as was the intimate and friendly atmosphere. We also loved the location and were pleasantly surprised by how quiet the neighborhood is. We will definitely stay at Brown's on our next visit to London.
May 2016,Amazing staff,Coming to this hotel never fails to lift my spirits: the staff here are always polite and helpful. The restaurant is excellent and the bar very pleasant indeed. The rooms are spotless and incredibly comfortable. price can be high at times. But it is worth it!
April 2016,Fantastic,The staff really made us feel special during the stay. I would definitely stay again and have no hesitation recommending Browns to all. Of special note they looked after our 2 boys in a very personal way.
May 2016,"Perfectly, wonderfully, utterly British home base","Its the sort of review you put off writing as it might make it more difficult to get in. I've stayed in loads of old school established London hotels -  the Claridges, The Connaught, The Savoy, Dukes and the Goring to name but a few. Whilst they are all great in their way I always come back to Browns. As anyone knows a good hotel is really so much more than just a good bed. It is a collective of quality elements, including and especially the food. Mark Hix food is just so consistently delicious, such a a celebration of just about everything that is good and wholesome and British, right down to the gull's eggs with celery salt in season. You might even be tempted to call Brown's a brilliant dining room with a hotel attached if it weren't for the truly perfect overall English‚Ä¶"
May 2016,Grand hotel In the best location,Brown's hotel is a perfect location for luxury shopping In Mayfair. The staff is very professional and nice. Rooms are clean and well maintained. Old splendor with modern touch. The SPA is an oasis In busy London. Hix resturant is a nice experience with a traditional english menu (try the fish and chips!).
April 2016,Brown's is our nr 1 hotel in london.,"I actually mentioned Brown's hotel on twitter. thanking everyone. Since I myself work as an anchor woman for dutch television, it will be picked up by many. Thank you so much. My daughter and I enjoyed our stay!!"
May 2016,Quintessential London hotel!,"This is the hotel to consider amongst the others! It hits all the marks - excellent location, classic yet stylish, warmest hospitality and truly ""at-your service""! The staff is attentive and the service is on point."
April 2016,Most sophisticated ,"A reborn classic, this first hotel in London has been transformed into a chic European winner under designer Olga Polizzi. It has an elegant clientele of Euros, not young US investment bankers lugging roll-on luggage like most other once deluxe London hotels  It is without pretense but with a jumping ground floor of with-it young English designers and personalities in a Hix restaurant, sprawling library and tea room with multiple fireplaces and a chic, hopping bar serving nonstop food and drinks. Dom Ruinart is the house champagne. Enough said."
April 2016,"Stylish, expensive, English and worth every penny!",Marvellous place for Friday cocktails with my beautiful daughter. Worth every penny! Drinks are served with olives and other nibbles. I was surprised to see and hear people openly and loudly chattering on phones at the bar when the code says this is not allowed. Bad form!
March 2016,Brown's Hotel sets the Standard for London Hotels but even the best can occasionally slip up. !,"This is a superb hotel where the staff, who mostly seem to be from overseas, have been very well trained. Service is remarkably good and all the staff are very friendly and attentive.We had one bad experience which, although quite trivial left a bad impression of the housekeeping staff but this did not in any way spoil our visit. It just demonstrated that no matter how good the management team may be, there is always someone who will, let the side down. i have pointed out this problem and am confidant that it will be rectified. We will be returning to Brown's on our next visit in July.."
April 2016,Afternoon Tea in a private dining room!,"Fabulous afternoon in the Byron room, a private dining venue for 12 girls to relax, drink champagne and eat cake! Brown's Hotel couldn't have been more helpful in arranging this special afternoon. Followed swiftly by some of the best cocktails in London in the Donovan bar - stunning to look at as well as on the tastebuds!"
April 2016,Feel at home in Mayfair,"Our family spent ten days at Browns. We could not have had a better experience. From our grandson who turned 10 the same day the Queen turned 90, to his grandfather who is 75, the experience was perfect. The friendly and professional service was evident from start to finish. Every member of the staff seemed to know our names within the first twelve hours of our stay. Wow!!"
April 2016,Fantastic!,"We had an overall great experience - private transfers in a luxury car which was well maintained, great service of the concierge and event team, great breakfast buffet as well as nice ambiente and very good service in the Donovan Bar. Rooms were well maintained and very clean. Just great!"
April 2016,Donovan's bar ,A very pleasant location just off Piccadilly great staff decor private special great service good food well recommended will go back again  The afternoon tea is a real delight try it!! A super romantic yet funky bar with some super photographers by mr D!
April 2016,"Excellent afternoon tea, lovely atmosphere","We have stayed here previously, this visit was for afternoon tea yesterday and had a wonderful time. Three generations; well cared for by friendly attentive staff who were only too happy to explain and look after us. Tables not too close together, lovely. As much food as we wished and the choice of traditional afternoon tea or tea-tox (the healthy option). Great sandwiches, (although the bagel was too chewy), brilliant scones, great cakes. Excellent choice of teas. Altogether a really positive experience. Only one thing (and this is not the only place to do this) why does it cost ¬£10 per glass of champagne?"
April 2016,The greatest birthday ever,Went for my sixty fifth birthday and it was well beyond my wishes. Wanted to take afternoon tea in the tea rooms. This was my sixth and seventh visit there. It was my fourth stay at Browns. My wife had told the staff it was my birthday and everyone went well beyond what would be expected. After we came back to our room on my birthday night I was shocked and overjoyed to find a chocolate mousse cake with a chocolate ganache icing in the room with the words Happy Birthday inscribed! 
April 2016,Dany,was a good an quality time in this very high british standard hotel. the service was exellent and the availability from the staff was exeptional. requests were handle very quick and with the highest standard. very british ideed.
April 2016,excellent but...,"I considere the Brown's one of the best hotels in London in a absolutely strategic location welcoming , quite , amazing service and very nice rooms . The breakfast is verygood for food and service . The SPA is gorgeous and the Gym has everything  you may need .On my opinion an hotel at his level should not require payment for wi-fi connection ."
March 2016,"World-Class, lovely hotel in the best part of London","My experience at the Brown's Hotel was outstanding from start to finish.  While the hotel was luxurious, and my room was large, well furnished & beautiful, the hotel was not stuffy at all.  I've stayed at many ""fancy"" hotels where I felt a need to dress a certain way in the lobby.  Brown's was not like that.  It's a perfect hotel for those who like being pampered & like to stay at a high class hotel, but who don't want snobby staff our ostentatious surroundings.  My junior suite was enormous.  It had a large sitting area, huge bathroom, as well as a walk in closet.  The location was perfect.  It's a quick walk to Soho and many tourist attractions.  But it was nice being a couple short blocks away from the hubbub.  If you like luxury shopping, Brown's is really the best hotel‚Ä¶"
April 2016,A delightful home from home in Central London,"Every time I have stayed at Browns I have felt genuinely welcomed. From the Doorman who takes the trouble to get your name (if he doesnt already know it!) and then escorts you to reception where again you feel they already know you even if its a first or second visit as they clearly look through their reservations in advance (which sadly few hotels do nowadays) and at least seem to know a bit about you which is very reassuring. The two rooms that I have experienced were both a delight. The decor is modern yet very discreet and the Deluxe Kings overlooking Albermarle Street are particularly spacious with very large bathrooms with separate showers and double sinks and bags of fluffy bath towels, his and her sized bathrobes (again few hotels bother) and superb toiletries. A mini‚Ä¶"
April 2016,LIke getting a big warm hug,"Everytime I stay here, whether for work or leisure, I just feel so happy and warm knowing that I will have a wonderful time.  This last stay was just as amazing as always.  From the comfort of the bedroom to the mouthwatering food to the exceptional care taken by all the team... It just feels like I get a big warm hug everytime I walk in the door!"
March 2016,Amazing service at every touch!,"Previously we stayed at the Ritz. This was our first stay at Browns and hopefully not our last! A world of consistently friendly professional service was our experience at Browns. The location is ideal in lovely Mayfair.  The property is beautiful with a lovely tea room, busy bar, restaurant and spa. Our favorite pubs and Indian restaurant were right out  the door. We had a deluxe room that was extremely comfortable. The quality of the sheets is amazing. The bathroom was roomy and had a separate glass shower and soaking tub. The continental breakfast buffet was fabulous! It included fresh fruit, pastry, meats and cheeses, fish and more. This was a five star experience and we adored it! The atmosphere was welcoming and we appreciated the experience. "
March 2016,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"A wonderful hotel worthy of the the heft bill. Five star service, luxurious amenities, well equipped gym and a very helpful concierge. Breakfast was a gastronomic experience and the concierge was both knowledgeable and informative. The staff was very attentive and focused on addressing every guests concerns and needs. The hotel is well located and within walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus and countless outstanding restaurants."
April 2016,Expensive but luxurious and very welcoming,"We return regularly here as it is always a lovely place to stay, with very good, friendly service. A quick chat with John on the door is always a pleasure. Very central. The restaurant is excellent but can be very noisy when busy."
April 2016,Great Hotel & Professional Team & HIX Mayfair,"Stayed here for one night only, but had an amazing experience. Very professional check in (I think the gentleman name was Stefan), room very well designed - modern with historic touch.  Had a dinner in HIX - great food and service. To finish our evening we moved to the Donovan bar where we were greeted by Head Barman Riccardo and tried two amazing cocktails -  ""Between Heaven and Earth"" and ""The Photographer"" made by  Luca - amazing - you HAVE to try these cocktails!  Cant wait to stay here again soon!"
March 2016,A wonderful experience!,"I went here for a special birthday treat. We booked far in advance for afternoon tea and got a table near the piano and the fireplace. This was more expensive than other afternoon tea venues but I didn't feel ripped off. We have a love dark wood hotel setting, great service, and even a doggie bag of the items we didn't finish after it was refilled anyway.   It was lovely, thank you."
March 2016,A delightful place to stay,The staff are incredibly friendly and hospitable. Very well mannered and always willing to help with a problem. The rooms are comfortable and not too noisy. Good amenities and comfortable beds. Very good location and excellent bar. The Hix restaurant is a pleasure to eat at as well. Would always choose to stay here.
March 2016,"Good Hotel, almost perfect",Very satisfied except for the unbearable noise coming from the airing system which did not allow sleeping with an open window. Helpful and friendly waiters. Outstanding Concierge. Will come again but will make sure to get a better room. Avoid room on the inner court.
March 2016,Nowhere Else,I would not stay anywhere else on London. The staff are unbelievably friendly and helpful. The rooms are of a very high standard.They are modern without being chintzy. The food at Hix including breakfast is of the highest order. This is an understated hotel of the highest order. 
March 2016,An excepcional experience,"It was like a ""royal"" fantasy.... Thanks for the personalized my experience in London, and  made me feel at home, far from home.  Strongly recommended, I would like to repeat the experience in a next trip"
March 2016,Excellent hotel - a luxury stay,"Another amazing stay at Browns. It was my birthday during our stay and the hotel kindly upgraded us and delivered a delicious birthday cake to our room which made it really special. Just a fantastic hotel, beautiful rooms, great service. Hope to stay again soon."
March 2016,Terrible view,My husband and I stayed recently at Browns  Rocco Forte Hotel in London  based on our previous excellent experience concerning the Charles Rocco Forte hotel in Munich. They put us in an average room with low ceiling and the worst thing was a window facing old drainage tubes . The upper space was covered by a metalic net in order to keep  birds away. It was a really depressing situation. They offered  us another room but we had to pay additional 100 pounds per night !!  Also the breakfast was limited compared to the Charles Rocco Forte in Munich. Why  the  standards  are not the same for all Rocco Forte Hotels???
March 2016,Back again,"Our family has come to Browns a few times over the last 25 or so years.  We try to spend the last two days at Browns before returning home.  The concierge was excellent, everything they did for us was invaluable: accepting delivery of a perishable package, restaurant recommendation, flight check-in, and more.  "
March 2016,Tea Torial --- Amazing day.!,"For last Christmas my wife gave ma voucher for the above event. We arrived very early but were soon accommodated by Andrea in the Tea Room. We were taken into a private room to be shown by a young man, Saju the pastry sous chef, how to make scones and then macaroons. Saju has only been at the hotel a few weeks. What a great ambassador for Brown's. We were with him for two hours!! Then we had the full afternoon tea which was superb. We have been many times in the past and it is definitely the best in London! Andrea then arranged with Saju a quick tour of the kitchen and two Gorgeous suites. This was a visit to go into our special memory bank. Please thank those men plus the other staff for a truly wonderful time."
February 2016,Wow!,"Fantastic service, always made to feel welcome and nothing was too much trouble. Friendly staff. Very central location, close to theatres, shopping and parks. Very luxurious and pampering experience.."
December 2015,Afternoon tea perfection,"Exquisite setting to meet an old German friend for a quintessential afternoon tea in the rather cosy and stylish English Tea Room.  Our waiter, Akki, couldn't have taken better care of us.  Big tip:  pace yourself.  the moreish sandwiches and delicacies followed by hot scones filled us up so that we couldn't manage the cake.  Prefer it to the Ritz.  it's that good."
December 2015,A luxury stay in London,"To celebrate a special birthday, we pushed the boat out and booked a room at Browns for a night, following a visit to the theatre. It was - for us, anyway - expensive but the experience proved to be memorable and well-worth the cost. The attention from the staff was first rate, starting with a quick tour of the ground floor before being taken to the room. Nothing was too much trouble - and a birthday cake and card were an extremely nice touch. We couldn't fault the room. We had chosen Browns after dinner a year before in HIX, their restaurant. We didn't dine this time - but breakfast provided an interesting choice with very  different items on the menu. The Irish bacon sandwich, a Moira soda farl with Peter Hannan‚Äôs guanciale, was novel and excellent and matched the subtle but‚Ä¶"
December 2015,"Delicious food, lovely being spoiled, relaxing ambience","We booked on-line Tea for Two in this Hotel, just this Sunday.  It was recommended by a friend.  You get treated like royalty, your coats are taken, shown to your seat, very comfortable chairs, lovely piano player playing in the background.  We had standard Tea for Two and lots of it!  Early Grey Tea that was replenished whenever we needed in beautiful silver pots.  Salmon, Egg, Avocado, Cheese sandwiches, rolls, daintily cut.  (we are non meat eaters).  And were asked if we wanted more - which we did!  Then fresh scrumptious scones with clotted cream and the best strawberry jam I have ever had.  An array of little cakes and then we were asked if we wanted chocolate fudge cake or lemon meringue.  we were bursting but we said yes :)  The attention from the waiters was lovely, not‚Ä¶"
January 2016,Back in mayfair,"My wife and I spent a view days in London for my birthday and we love Mayfair, so consequential we came back and stayed at the Browns hotel. Very friendly and attentive personal from the concierge, reception and the waiters. Very excellent breakfast with nice and honey seating. Also the dinner is absolutely good which is not always the case at hotel restaurants even those with 5 stars. We come back for sure."
January 2016,A relaxing oasis with exquisite service!,"After an hour on the ice rink at the Winter Wonderland, Hyde Park we were in need of a cup of tea and respite! And I knew just where I wanted to go, Browns Hotel. On arrival we were greeted warmly by the doorman and taken through to the bar for tea. I might add that our party included our three year old who was equally welcomed (and given a chocolate coin by the doorman on our way out which was such a lovely touch). Our pram and coats were whisked away and we were given a wonderful table and seating area in the beautifully decorated bar. The service from all staff was exquisite and very friendly, just as I'd remembered it. My son ordered a hot chocolate (¬£9!! and worth every penny) and was presented with a tray of melted real chocolate, warm milk in a Turkish pot, marshmallows‚Ä¶"
January 2016,Outstanding ,"The English Tea Room at Browns Hotel not only captivates the quintessential English afternoon tea but serves it with tremendous style. Our waiter, Stefano, provided us with a friendly, professional high level of service that I almost forgot existed.  The gluten free option of sandwiches and cakes were by far the best I have ever had and we loved the Cornish afternoon tea blend.  Browns remains one of the best afternoon tea experiences London has to offer. A marvellous place to sit, relax and enjoy the tinkling of the ivory and a tradition that lives on with understated class in this charming establishment."
January 2016,December 2015,"Quintessential London - best in class service, wonderful rooms and excellent restaurant for breakfast and dinner. Fully recommended if you want to treat yourself and be in the thick of it all in the West End"
January 2016,The best hotel in London,"I have tried all the 5-star hotels in London and finally realized I will not stay anywhere except The Browns -- from Claridges, Four Seasons, Mandarin - this is the best.  Rita, Alistar, and Stefan ensured I stayed in my favorite room - all the rooms are spacious and luxurious - I just have a preference to a special room here.  The bathrooms are very very large with a separate shower, tub, bidet and of course, the towel warmer.  Room service is fast and friendly and food very yummy.  You cannot go wrong staying here - simply stated it is a luxury hotel experience in the best neighborhood (Mayfair) yet on a quiet street. Cheers to the staff at The Brown's!  and a big thanks for making my stay great."
December 2015,Beautiful & relaxing hotel in central London,"Browns is a beautiful hotel in the heart of Mayfair, off the beaten track and surprisingly quiet for a London hotel.  The service is excellent, staff are friendly and helpful, yet non intrusive.  I love the fact this hotel is not pretentious and all guests are treated with the same care and attention.  There is a lovely ambience in the hotel and as you step into reception you can almost feel your shoulders soften and relax after a long day in the office.  The room I stayed in was comfortable and well equipped.  My only criticism would be that the television needed upgrading and the bed was two singles joined together which was not as comfortable as a King. Despite this I had a lovely stay and the food was delicious.  I will definitely be returning in the future. "
December 2015,Pure Luxury,Browns Hotel provides a 5 star experience from the moment you check in. Staff are professional and friendly and the rooms offer a timeless elegance and comfort. The style and decor of the hotel is classic and celebrates old English Heritage. Highly recommended.
March 2015,January 2016 stay,"It was a great experience to enjoy the level of luxury that Brown's can offer. Everyone makes you feel exceptionally welcome.  The room was beautiful, the breakfast was fresh and the service was the best. "
December 2015,Best hotel in London,"A first class hotel in a fantastic location. You cannot get more centrally located. Wonderful service - all the staff were friendly not stuffy but extremely professional. In all a ,totally relaxing. It is like stepping back in time but with all modern conveniences. If you fancy being a Miss Marple this is the place for you."
December 2015,Prime location,"Well established high end hotel, well placed for London attractions, luxury shops and restaurants. Staff are trained well and are discreet and friendly without being OTT.  Room 417 was quiet and comfortable. Improvements would be to have tea making facilities in room, and the TV opposite the bed rather than under the chaise.  Nice touch to have interesting books available in the room not knackered paper backs."
December 2015,Elegant home base in the heart of London,9 days between Christmas and New Year.  Wonderful experience made better by a great staff and superb location.  Staff makes everyone feel welcomed and astonishingly almost everyone greeted me by name on every encounter.  Elegant without being at all stuffy; exceptionally high level of service without being intrusive.  One of our best meals of the trip at Hix.  
December 2015,Centrally located,"Central location great for shopping or hopping on the Tube. Very friendly staff. We had high tea in the restaurant, which was a great experience - they had a wonderful selection of teas. We stayed in a junior suite and found the accommodations to be quite enjoyable."
December 2015,Nice Hotel,"Full of tradition and a great welcome . Was somewhat disappointed with the room, nothing special and quite expensive for what it is, in fact a little tired in the bathroom. The bar was excellent with a good selection of drinks and food.  Great location, hence the price."
December 2015,Christmas Tea,"Had a wonderful Christmas Tea. Brown's Hotel is a London landmark. Impeccable service with attention to all the details. The atmosphere is sophisticated yet family friendly. The quality of the tea (finger sandwiches, scones and sweets) was exceptional.  Highly recommend! "
November 2015,Fabulous Browns Hotel,Beautiful quality hotel with an air of class set in a fabulous part of London. Well situated for fine shopping and dining. Staff courteous and welcoming at all time. Will Be returning to this hotel sometime soon. Five star.
December 2015,Classy Hotel,"Birthday lunch for two, early December.  Can't wait to return and stay over.  For me its all about style, ambience and service [good but not fussy], food comes second.  The trip began with a magical cab ride through Mayfair - this has got to be the best area to visit at ths time of year.  Claridges, which I almost booked looked spectacular.  Brown's however did not disappoint.  I'm a fan of the Endsleigh and Tresanton and although I was aware of the connection I didn't expect this hotel to feel quite so intimate and exclusive on arrival.  After an hour we reluctantly swapped the Donovan Bar for the dining room where the excellent service continued.  Highlights of the meal included the soda bread, the sides [delicious mash and creamed spinach] and the Sancere.  Prepare yourself‚Ä¶"
April 2015,Best location in London,Brown's is a legendary hotel in the best location in London. The staff and management are outstandingly helpful and friendly and go out of their way to make you comfortable. I cannot recommend the hotel more highly! Sebastian Taylor
December 2015,Fantastic 50th Birthday Celebration,"Fantastic team made our friends 50th Birthday extra special.   From the point of arrival and being greeted by the doorman, to a relaxed drink in the bar and then an exquisite meal at Hix - the entire evening, service and food was faultless. Nothing was too much trouble.  If you want somewhere extra special then this is the place to go! "
December 2015,perfection,"all aspects top notch. casual , understated luxury. simply wonderful.  feels like a home away from home. staff excellent.  extremely impressed with room, service , restaurants, bar, room service and facilities ( gym ). "
December 2015,Once again another perfect stay,"This was our second stay at Browns and we thoroughly enjoyed it. From the well appointed room, huge bathroom, quiet but central location, high level of service,  a lovely ambient bar, and the perfect breakfast, we couldn't have had a more perfect stay.  We will definitely stay here next time we are in town."
December 2015,Wonderful Anniversary Micro Break,"My husband and I stayed here to celebrate our wedding anniversary, a one night micro break!  The hotel staff were fantastic from start to finish.  When booking we mentioned we had stayed at Brown's for the first night of our honeymoon, 6 years ago and they couldn't have been more accommodating at having us back!   On arrival the door man greeted me by name (very slick!) reception staff were charming, we had a huge upgraded room, complimentary champagne and rose petals on our bed in the evening!  Superb customer service!   The bar is great for a pre dinner drink, really buzzy but intimate to get you in the mood on a Friday evening.  We shall definitely be returning for another anniversary micro break in April 2016! "
December 2015,A wonderful stay ,Amazing hotel very friendly with beautiful rooms.  Checkin and out very swift with attention to detail. Breakfast extremely good with many choices.  Service in bar was superb with extensive selection of gins.  Position in London great for shopping and underground. Highly recommend much preferred to Ritz. 
December 2015,Excellent service,We stayed with our twin 10 month old babies and were given a complementary upgrade to a junior suite on arrival. The suite had been prepared with toys and treats for the babies which was wonderful. The food in the Hix restaurant was excellent as always.
December 2015,West end luxury,"Fabulous place in the west end of London. Recommended if you are looking to be in the center of the west end. Service was fantastic, rooms luxurious and staff very friendly and knowledgeable. Atmosphere was relaxed luxury.  "
December 2015,A home from home,It is simply perfect staying at the Brown's. You feel so comfortable and well looked after and of course the room is sublime. I only can recommend this hotel to everyone who likes to feel save and comfortable. It is very quiet and just lovely. The staff is exceptional.
December 2015,another wonderful pre-Christmas stay at our favourite London hotel,Staying at Browns any time is wonderful but Christmas time has to be the best.  This year's decorations were stylish and sparkling as ever - very clever tie up with Fortnum and Masons just down the road.  THE most comfortable beds ever so a perfect night's sleep guaranteed every time and and as always the usual wonderful friendly welcome by everyone from the Doorman on in.  The bar was buzzing and breakfast the next morning finished off our perfect pre-Christmas treat perfectly - the burford eggs scrambled with smoked salmon on gluten free toast really was the icing on the cake - we left set up for the perfect Christmas.  Thank you Browns
December 2015,Excellent Tea,"Booked well in advance and had a most pleasant experience. There are multiple rooms used for tea all with a fine ambiance, with a piano player in residence. Seating very comfortable, noise levels fine. Firstly you have to choose the tea, large selection, then the sandwiches and pastries are brought, which are replenished on demand. Sandwiches fresh and tasty. Scones with and without sultanas with mini mince pies and a very thick curl of clotted cream with strawbery jam- very good. Pastries delicate, numerous and delicious (perhaps the blackcurrant ""Macaron"" is an acquired taste). Finally there is a choice of christmas cake or brownie mousse cake but by this stage every one is stuffed, so I would recommend moderation to get to the end. All washed down with copious tea. Perhaps‚Ä¶"
November 2015,"Excellent hotel, can't wait to return","Cannot fault this hotel. A great luxury hotel in a great part of London. Room and bathroom was spacious, clean, high quality- one of the best I have stayed in London. Staff are exceptionally friendly and very helpful. I cannot wait to return..."
November 2015,Our family hotel,"Booked via our Personal Concierge. Travelled with my husband and 3 daughters (13, 12, 3). Git 2 classic rooms with adjoining doors at no extra costs, Given cot, bath set and nappy change set and complimentary hit choc and biscuits for all family. Personalised ginger breads for our daughters with their names on them. Rooms clean and beautifully decorated and large. Our daughters love the hotel. My husband and I love the hotel. Location very good for shopping and Hyde Park. The hotel does valet parking. Have stayed there twice before. Would definitely stay there again."
November 2015,"Atmosphere, atmosphere, atmosphere!","The tearoom.....a must visit for those who want to experience a tradition. Sandwiches were so excellent I never got to the scones and clotted cream, not to speak of the Christmas cake that awaited. Many teas to choose from, comfy seats, waiters falling over themselves to please you. We had the last sitting which allowed us to stay at our leisure. A treat! Don't be surprised at the prices....they are high. "
November 2015,"Brown's Hotel, Mayfair, London","Brown's is a luxury heritage hotel in the heart of London steeped in history with fascinating literary connections.  It is conveniently close to parks & gardens, theatres, galleries & museums, cafes & shops, and tube stations.   It has excellent dining facilities and a well-equipped gym and spa. This hotel is very highly recommended not only for its beautiful architectural exterior and tasteful interiors but because of its tradition of providing high quality service.   Brown's should be considered for any special stays especially at Christmas time when it creates a beautiful festive atmosphere.   "
October 2015,Wonderful place to stay,"This isn't a cheap London option but it is a lovely one. The staff are friendly, the rooms sizeable, showers, beds and pillows all welcoming and gorgeous. Location is perfect and the breakfast was wonderful. If you can afford to treat yourself go for it. It is a far better option than  other more pricey options in the capital in my experience."
November 2015,Excellent stay as always!,"Flawless service. All the staff are excellent with our children. It is all the little touches- personal greeting, children's bedclothes and toys- that make staying at Browns such a pleasure. We love coming back to our London home!        "
November 2015,Elegance and Service,"A venerable, elegant hotel with a stylish, cosmopolitan air.  Superb service and staff made our stay easy and enjoyable.  Unlike many hotels at this level where a stiff formality prevails, Brown's cultivates a lively and personal touch among its staff.  Our Junior Suite was glorious, the bar was warm and festive, breakfast selection was extensive and of high quality.  I will certainly be back."
December 2014,Nothing to complain,"Luxury hotel in the west end of London. Rooms are spacious, clean, and with a lot of extras typical for Rocce Forte resorts; breakfast is delicious. I really had nothing to complain and the service team obliging. Prices are at the upper end  but given the Mayfair location not really surprising."
November 2015,English Tea,"My husband and I had a terrific afternoon at Brown's for tea. We visited London (from MA) while our son was studying abroad.  Going to a fine tea was a ""bucket list"" item for me, so I did a lot of online research about the best places to go.  Brown's did not disappoint!  The tea room was beautiful; elegant yet comfortable, not stuffy.  The staff were polite and attentive, not snobby.  (I work in the service industry so I really hate attitude from my server when I'm the paying guest).  The food was beautifully presented and offered a nice selection.  Seconds were at the ready.  It was all delicious.  I had a glass of Ruinart Champagne... Delicious (wish I could find it in the States).  Our waiter asked if we were visiting for a special event so we said yes, ""the day before was‚Ä¶"
October 2015,A Lovely Stay,"We had booked afternoon tea and a stay overnight. We wanted to check in early at 1215pm but our room wasn't ready. We had booked afternoon tea for 1430hrs. The reception (very busy and we had to wait !)            suggested we took tea early at 1215pm, which we did as we had a long morning attending to other business in London. The afternoon tea was delicious. We had to ask the reception if our room was ready after tea (when we arrived home we had a message from the reception on our home phone advising us that the room was ready !!!!). The room was very nice and quite. Overall a lovely English hotel with excellent staff."
October 2015,Great Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon Tea in the private Lord Byron Room, service was outstanding and staff very helpful and informative. The whole experience was lovely from the minute we walked in the door, great selection of sandwiches and cakes and more cakes, the scones were delicious to."
November 2015,Quintessental excellence in leafy Mayfair,"Took afternoon tea at Brown's and it could not have been better. Better than The Dorchester and Claridges, Brown's is in a class of its own. Set in the heart of Mayfair, from the beautiful fa√ßade to the sumptuous interiors, this place welcomes you and more. The staff are wonderfully attentive and the cuisine better than you will experience at most of London's top hotels. In short, Brown's Hotel is arguably one of London's finest and feels like a home away from home every time you visit it."
September 2015,World Class Experience,"I know its a 5 star hotel but it truly was a wonderful stay.  Every aspect of my stay was world class.  Hotel was beautiful, the staff were fantastic, the Donovan Bar bartenders and back bar staff were amazing - they are truly masters of their profession.  The food was excellent throughout my stay.  Anyone looking for a world class establishment with the budget to support should consider Brown's Hotel without hesitation."
October 2015,Boutique luxury in the heart of Mayfair,"Stayed here for the first 2 nights of a part holiday / part business trip to the UK, and can not say enough good things about this hotel. Location wise, straight forward to get to by taxi from Heathrow, easy access to local tube stations, walking distance to the shopping areas of Regent street and New Bond street, strolling access to the restaurants and bars in Mayfair, and manageable commutable times in and around the West End.  We booked a Classic Room with king size bed, which was perfect for the 2 of us. The bed is one of the most luxurious I‚Äôve slept in, as are all the finishings and amenities in the rooms, exactly what you‚Äôd expect from a Rocco Forte hotel. The room‚Äôs are large, with a great work space area, reclining sofa, seperate wardrobe area and bathroom,. The‚Ä¶"
October 2015,Browns accommodation,I'm a frequent business guest and would appreciate if my room preference would be acknowledged. For a usual long stay of a week a spacious cloakroom is highly appreciated. Ultimately negative comments about room smell should be acknowledged as well. Giving me rooms with continuous short falls doesn't feel right considering the amount of stays of 1 week per month minimum.                     
February 2015,First class,"Ten most fabulous warm and genuine welcome set the tone of our one night stay this weekend. The room (203) was superbly furnished and finished to a high standard with little details thought of, leaving you wanting nothing. Although no tea and coffee making facilities in the room, service to the room was always efficient. The hotel bar was busy with top notch service and a great atmosphere. A duff cocktail and a nasty appetiser were put right fairly swiftly and without any fuss whatsoever. We thought the service at the hotel throughout was exemplary and made a fun weekend fantastic. We'll definitely be back if staying in London again."
November 2014,Club Sandwich in the bar area.,"To me, the sandwich was very tasty and absolutely perfect! The beer I ordered was very chilled and lovely.  The service was flawless, kind and attentive.  Only slight downside, was that the live piano music was a bit overpowering.  Would I recommend the place? Absolutely!  I will return."
October 2015,Best hotel in Mayfair,This hotel is in an amazing location the staff are awesome so so friendly and the rooms  are perfect clean and modern with character and the Hix restaurant is just awesome !!! I always feel it's a home from home at Browns they never forget me my name and can get you into the best restaurants as they have the conceirge in london they bend over backward to help you get or make thank special event special !!! If browns can't get it it literally means it can't be got anywhere !!!!! I stay their possibly 4 times a month I have the choice to stay where ever I wish and I wouldnt ever go anywhere else !!!                      
January 2015,week-end in London,I first experienced the Brown's 25 years ago. Standards have significantly been up graded burt the spirit of the hotel has been preserved.  An exclusive place were to stay. The Brown's is a combination of tradition and modernity.
October 2015,Stayed there 4 times and id stay again,Rocco forte is one of my favorite chains in europe and they will make sure to satisfy you by all means.  Concierge is outstanding (Omar)  Rooms are beautiful Reception always try to do their best to check you in as early as possible taking into consideration that my flight always arrives early in the morning. The bar is gem in london very classic and classy and of course the location is just the best
September 2015,"simple, elegant and comfortable",Rocco Forte Brown doesn't seem to be a very popular but I think it is a very nice hotel that offers great amenities. It is centrally located in a nice neighborhood. Staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast buffet is excellent. The only negative is that we have to wait a long time to check in to our room. We were forced to upgrade so we can get in to the next available room. The room was huge and very comfortable but they should have given us a better deal since there are no other rooms available.
October 2015,Excellent stay,"Great central location, handy for Oxford, Regent and Bond Streets, as well as Picadilly; great staff from your first encounter with the doorman and who always speak, try to be helpful and recognise you as an individual rather than as a room number and very comfortable, impeccably clean room. All adds up to a great stay.                     "
October 2015,Afternoon Tea,"Had a lovely Afternoon Tea here shortly after Christmas.  In a lovely, old-fashioned style room with an amazing open fire, much less modern and contemporary than Claridges, for example. The Afternoon Tea itself was delicious and we were well looked after. However, our drinks upon arrival (we were a little early) were extortionately priced, ¬£13.50 for a pineapple juice and a sherry! I would therefore recommend you arrive just in time for your Afternoon Tea slot."
September 2015,Superb,Excellebt service. Everyone friendly and welcoming. Perfect location. Food and afternoon tea lovely. The art gallery tour was a terrific addition to trip  I can't wait to recommend to friends and to return                      
September 2015,Want to be pampered?  Stay at Brown's!,A fabulous romantic retreat with wonderful service and exceptional staff! Nothing was too much trouble and we were made to feel so welcome.  I would whole-heartedly recommend this as a place to stay if you want a treat!              
April 2015,MARAVILLOSO!!! Outstanding service!!,"We stayed for our second honeymoon for 4 nights, everything was excellent starting from service, details, crew attention, food, and LOCATION! It is near everything you want to visit and crew sent us every night to the best restaurants at walking distance. Very nice experience üëç"
July 2015,Low key,"Small, low key, great location, good service. I have stayed here before but didn't appreciate it as much. Probably my top pick in Mayfair--no bling, simple. Room was reasonable size with a very good bathroom. Espresso machine in room would be welcome. B&O TV should be replaced with a newer Samsung that swivels. House keeping did a sloppy job initially but management addressed the issue immediately and gave me a free upgrade."
September 2015,Out of this world,Brown's Hotel offers something different than other hotels in London -peace and tranquility but only 2 minutes away from all the action! The staff are amazing and nothing is too much trouble. I adore breakfast in the restaurant every time I visit. After a visit to the theatre we always go to Donavan's bar in the hotel and can not praise the staff enough. Already planning my next visit.
September 2015,Perfect location,Loved the Hotel. Staff were excellent and provided a faultless service. The building itself was stylish and well appointed. Breaks at was good and the staff in the bar very helpful. Would happily stay again.
July 2015,Our first Afternoon Tea experience could not have been better,"Me and my friends visited Browns on my trip to London during Easter Holidays and as this was our first time experiencing genuine English Afternoon Tea and we were very pleased of our choice of place. We opted for their Tea-Tox Afternoon Tea menu, which seemed interesting. When we requested staff for re-fill of sandwiches, they told as that at that moment kitchen was making new Tea-Tox sandwiches but they could bring us the regular sandwiches and some traditional scones in addition and of course we were happy to try them as well. Also, staff was kind enough to suggest if we would like to try a different type of tea (and of course we were not hard to persuade) ;): Only one hick-up during our setting was that, i guess we over stay our booking little bit and we were kind of‚Ä¶"
September 2015,A great place to stay in london,"Great location, great food and accommodation. We really enjoyed our stay at Brown's. The staff were very friendly and helpful and we will definitely go back to Brown's. The hotel is near a myriad of great restaurants and shops."
November 2014,Outstanding/pristine hotel for short ( or even long ) business trips,"Nothing else except that this is a true gem in Mayfair. Great team of staff, made my stay very enjoyable. Very central location, ideal for visiting London. Will visit again. The beds were so comfortable I felt like I was on a cloud. Nice breakfast selection too."
August 2015,Excellent Location Great Hotel,"Stayed in this hotel twice with family great service comfortabl rooms excellent location near to best store resturant very distinguished location. Rooms are decorated elegantly very well maintained clean spacious bathroom shower and bath tub included. Rooms get prepared for night as well.  Breakfast is rich satisfying and delgious. Specially if you get English breakfast. Very close to Bond street , Picadilly street, Ragent street, and Oxford street. It is at cross road. Walking distance to all of the above. Room service is fast and friendly. At the door they are very helpful to find taxi. Good concierge service ."
August 2015,Exquisite,"You know you are at a premium hotel in Mayfair when the porter brings up your bags and says, ""Would you like me to unpack for you, Madame?""  The level of service; the location; and the demeanor and attention of the staff at Brown's cannot be exceeded. I had the full English breakfasts each day, tea in the afternoon, and lunch one day as well during my stay. All were terrific. The neighborhood is fun for walking and window shopping, but mostly, it was the graciousness of the staff and the hotel itself that I loved so much.  I have to confess, I wish they had not updated the rooms to the very modern '70's retro. The washroom was wonderful, but the decorating in the bedrooms is not to my taste anymore. I loved the timeless, old world, traditional antiques and am afraid this new‚Ä¶"
September 2015,The best Home from Home,"Our second time at Brown's and we were welcomed back by the friendly efficient staff. The service is top, the food beautiful. They do a top, popular afternoon tea. The concierge and doormen make you feel so at home and seem genuinely interested in what you are and have been doing. The room was most comfortable and the bathroom large with a proper shower!!"
September 2015,Elegance in the heart of London,"Stylish hotel in the most famous business ans shopping area in London. Perfect location, high quality service and great cocktails at the bar. Rooms are nice with old furniture. Part of famous boutique hotels chain. Prefer Hotel de Russie in Rome but this is an excellent hotel as well."
August 2015,How a Fine Hotel Should Be,"Brown's is one of a handful of hotels at the pinnacle of the accomodation business. Like it's sister establishment, The Savoy in Florence, the team at Brown's (and they are so obviously a team) provide a professional and friendly welcome, seamless service and concierge assistance, generous well-appointed rooms immaculately maintained, in a perfect location. All without fuss but with perfect aplomb.               "
August 2015,"5star, real Britisch, real London","Enjoyed two days at Brown's very much, what I've experienced was well above my expectations, excellent location too. Do not miss the Afternoon Tea and Spa. OK, what was negative? I've forgot and would love to return to this hotel."
August 2015,Convenience at its maximum,"Everything was extremely, convenient, supportive and friendly. This was my first time in the hotel and I am sure I will be back soon. Business trips through this accommodation become very easy and make you to wish to be back!"
August 2015,Understated luxury,"A fantastic hotel to experience London, a perfect location with perfect service. Rooms are understated but terrific. Breakfast and afternoon tea are fantastic.  Close walk or tube to most of the highlights of London in a nice quite setting.   "
September 2015,English charm,"We stayed here for our anniversary using our Avios and had a wonderful time. The decor was classy and comfortable with references to the Queen, Winston Churchill and Rudyard Kipling. It was convenient to get to, walking distance from Green Park and many restaurants and clubs.        "
July 2015,"Service, style - sublime","Of course the location is perfection for food, shopping and exercise - the magnificent Hyde Park in summer a minute away. But for privacy, attention to detail, unobtrusive but omnipresent service - this hotel rates on all fronts.Love that you don't bump into others in the corridors, that a quiet corner can be found in the bar if needed but another seat 10 meters away is on offer as well with a different vibe and audio.  And when the day is done sinking into the bed with pillows to die for, floor mat and slippers laid out, along with glass bottles of still and sparking mineral water sleep seems almost a waste of time. As we bade farewell to the doorman in tails as the car was brought up  - given bottles of water and a tin of traveller sweets for the journey we knew we had a new‚Ä¶"
September 2015,Fantastic Afternoon Tea,"At GBP55/head you cannot fault this afternoon tea. We booked and arrived a little ahead of time and were promptly shown to our table. The sandwiches and cakes just keep coming. The service from the staff is efficient and pleasant. In theory the booking is only for 90 minues, but we stayed on a little longer they continued to serve us with more3 cakes. The choice of teas is excpetional, and for non tea drinkers coffee is available. Much better value than some other nearby ritzy hotel."
September 2015,"Excellent, traditional style hotel","We booked a suite and were upgraded to a one bedroom suite which was wonderful, especially as I was very unwell and retired to the bedroom allowing my partner to watch football and enjoy room service to his heart's delight.  The staff were excellent, even offering to send up some honey when they heard my croaky voice requesting more tea bags!  Breakfast was a lovely leisurely affair with the most spectacular buffet display and it was delicious.  My slight critique is that I prefer coffee to be served in an individual pot or cafetiere rather than poured from an albeit elegant, jug.  The whole vibe of the hotel is laid back luxuriousness and I hope I can return when I can really fully enjoy it"
October 2014,Excellent service,"Great team of staff, made my stay very enjoyable.  Very central location, idea for visiting London.  Will visit again.  Only thing I do not like is our bed was made up by two single beds, could be better if it was one proper bed                                   "
September 2015,Great Afternoon Tea,"Booked Afternoon Tea for a treat for my wife and I.  My wife has several dietary requirements and we explained these requirements on booking.  We were pretty dubious before booking as to whether they'd be able to accommodate her.  We could not have been more pleased when they brought out her 3 tiered afternoon tea stand, she had gluten free sandwiches, and cakes, scones and chocolates.  The selection of teas were very interesting.  The service was very good and we felt as if we'd stepped back in time and we felt very special.  The decor is very in keeping with the classic hotel, and the atmosphere is very welcoming. Would definitely book again and recommend to others."
August 2015,Afternoon Tea,"My husband and I stayed at Brown's Hotel some years ago and could not rate the hotel highly enough!  This time we booked afternoon tea there for our 30th wedding anniversary.  The experience was so enjoyable.  Staff are trained to the highest standard and could not be more helpful.  The afternoon tea was like no other with an abundance of treats. We started with a glass of pink champagne as the occasion was special. The smoked salmon was the best I have ever had. Before we enjoyed the most delicious cakes warm scones arrived with jam and cream.  These are baked fresh every 20 minutes and we actually had a second helping!  We finished the cakes and were completely full, unable to eat anything else on offer.  They even gave us a cake box with two large portions of gateaux to take‚Ä¶"
September 2015,Excellent experience,"Our recent stay at Brown's Hotel was a fabulous experience.  Their staff are their best asset right through the hotel from the reception we received on arrival, checkin, house keeping and the restaurant staff.  Special mention to the concierge team for their help also.  I cannot speak highly enough of all the staff we encountered during our stay.  This hotel seems homely and inviting and not intimidating in it's atmosphere.  We will definitely be back!"
September 2015,Very Nice Hotel,Stayed here for a weekend and enjoyed the visit. The restaurant is very nice and breakfast and lunch was excellent with good service throughout the hotel. Nice bar with good snacks if you only want a light meal.
October 2014,Perfect for any occasion,Attention to detail was second to none. Mentioned it was our 20th wedding anniversary and later on received a plate of delicious cakes delivered to our room! A wonderful hotel in a fantastic location!
August 2015,Wins the prize for kid-friendliness!,"We've travelled extensively with our baby in her first 6 months.  Just to give you an idea, she's already clocked almost 25k miles on British Airways alone.  As you can imagine, that also means we stay in a lot of hotels with her.  We can definitively say that Brown's has been the best and most pleasant stay we've had.    One of the first few things we have to do when we arrive at any hotel room is set up the nappy changing station because there's a good chance the baby's been sitting in a very soiled diaper no matter how well you timed the previous diaper change.  That wasn't a problem for us at Brown's because the lovely Housekeeping staff have already set up a changing station replete with a few nappies, wet wipes, and baby oil/nappy rash cream at the ready.  If things‚Ä¶"
August 2015,Great Hotel,"This Hotel not only is one of the oldest hotels in London but still provide excellent service, in the Hotel, restaurant & Spa. All the staff are very helpful nothing to much trouble. The Donovan Bar for cocktails is just amazing, a must if your staying at Browns. The Hix restaurant is also excellent, with a very good choice on the a la carte menu & also a greasy selection of wines to choose from.  Thank you it's always a great experience stopping at Browns. "
August 2015,Afternoon tea at Brown's,"We only had afternoon tea here, but enjoyed the atmosphere, the service and the excellent food.  I had never had scones with jam and clotted cream before, not a recommended menu for anyone with heart disease!  The finger sandwiches were yummy, as were the tiny desserts.  I tried two different types of tea; both were good but I am not a big tea drinker in the best of circumstances and wanted to try the ""total experience"".  Was good but rather pricey."
August 2015,I love it,One of my favourites from more than thirty years. Confortable rooms and bathrooms. Junior suites are excellent. Tea time is absolutely as it has to be: traditional and cosy. Perfect location. Bepi Olivieri
May 2015,Perfect Location,"Lovely London icon. Location can't be beat for walking and shopping. Excellent service and attention, only wish the rooms would match the 5 star treatment. They are comfortable, but could be so much more."
August 2015,Classy and so comfortable with assured friendly service,"We stayed at Brown's for a birthday celebration for 2 nights. We arrived 10am and chanced asking if our room might be available ahead of normal check-in time, and the lovely front desk lady arranged this in 15 minutes - great start! Our spacious bedroom was spotlessly clean with lovely luxurious amenities and the most comfortable bed we've ever slept in, superlight duvet as well. We went out for the day to return to a lovely birthday cake from the hotel, such a nice touch. Concierge chaps Jack and Amr were just fabulous, asking all the right questions and more importantly listening, to home in on what would turn out to be perfect choices in restaurants and exhibitions for us, this made our stay very enjoyable. Breakfast was delicious with good choices and the staff were very‚Ä¶"
August 2015,Excellent hotel in great location,This hotel and staff and service are great. I do not know the rooms other than the Deluxe suite which is great. The location is great for shopping and taxis are readily available for sightseeing. The only disappointment is The Hix Dining.
August 2015,One word.......AMAZING.,"Stayed this weekend for a business trip and all I can say is I was treated like royalty from start to finish. Stayed in room 221, first class to say the least. The staff on arrival, throughout the weekend, breakfast staff, doormen, porters, just everyone..... you are all a credit to the hotel.  I can't wait to return again soon."
August 2015,Quintessentially English with a fabulous cocktail bar," really lovely cocktail bar and great sharing menu. Must go back for dinner. The staff are delightful, decor and ambiance are gorgeous. This is the place to go for afternoon tea. Quintessentially English."
August 2015,Excellent,"Fantastic hotel in a fantastic location. Close to Piccadilly and just around the corner from Old Bond Street , this is close to all the designer shops and many restaurants  The hotel has a great bar and offers afternoon tea and although we didn't use the restaurant , it looked ideal"
July 2015,Lunch at the Hix restaurant,"We treated ourselves to lunch to celebrate our wedding anniversary as we very much liked the look of the menu. We had the three course set menu and it was absolutely delicious, not too heavy and very tasty. Service was excellent with lots of staff around and we were presented with a complimentary plate of cakes to go with our coffee afterwards in honour of the occasion! The hotel is beautiful, quite old-fashioned and atmospheric, but with some good modern art in the very comfortable dining room. All in all a very enjoyable outing."
July 2015,"Perfect Hotel, Perfect Location","I don't write a lot of reviews, but this place deserves one.  The property is excellent.  The rooms are clean, VERY quiet and the beds give a reason to sleep in.  It's also great that they have a tea room, bar and full restaurant, each of which is excellent.  (The bar has some of the most innovative cocktails that I've seen).  The location is great for everything, as well.  But the best part is easily the staff.  Wow.  Everyone from the concierge, to valets to doormen, etc.  Just A+.    I live in hotels and due to business many times find myself at much pricier hotels around the world, but never a better experience than this one."
July 2015,Pedicure,"Visited the spa on 14th August and was greeted by Kelly-Anne. She was delightful and gave me a lovely pedicure. I was almost tempted by the mojito pedicure but am looking forward to the the winter season when they have mulled wine, a real fun idea."
July 2015,Friends Birthday celebration - Afternoon Tea,"Had Afternoon Tea with friends on Sunday 16th August, 2015 Very nice, bit disappointed with the lack of smoked salmon in the sandwiches. Instead they provided a kind of salmon mousse in Bridge rolls, which just ok. Also the scones are very small and tend to break up. Everything is replenished, there is plenty to eat. Lovely venue, we were sat on a corner sofa, plenty of room and comfortable. Service was ok, did struggle at times to understand the waiter, but he was very pleasant. Would recommend because overall it is very good, but could improve in my view as mentioned above."
July 2015,Afternoon tea,"Afternoon tea treat for my husband. A delicious selection of sandwiches and sweets. The scones are delicately soft and chewy. The staff are attentive and kind. Slightly disappointed in other ""guests"" not making an effort to dress smartly. One person in a hoodie and another in tatty jeans and trainers! Come on people. Give afternoon tea the credit it deserves.  Tea at Browns was a lovely experience that I would highly recommend!"
January 2015,Perfect,"Absolutely first class experience from check-in to (reluctant) check-out.  Browns is the friendliest and most efficient hotel at which we have ever stayed in London, and its location could not be surpassed for our particular requirements.        "
July 2015,"Browns Hotel, Mayfair",Browns meets all 5 star expectations and the location is excellent. The breakfast offering is a delight and the table service first thing in the morning is a great way to start the day. It makes a difference when key staff know your name and greet you with it every time.        
July 2015,Perfect hotel... and keeps getting better and better!,"This was my third time at Brown's with my family for a relatively long stay (about 15 nights) and I have to say this excellent hotel keeps getting better and better! Rooms are spacious and the decor is extremely pleasant - classic with some modern touches. All rooms I have stayed so far looked like brand new, recently refurbished. Location is perfect for tourism or business. Therefore, in terms of the physical aspects of the hotel, Brown's is clearly a 10! It deserves to be mentioned that the hotel prepared some nice touches for the kids - books, toys, special bed linen, everything specially designed for kids. Even a special ginger biscuit with my son's name on it was there waiting for us! However, the real difference you feel in the hotel services. The staff is AMAZING! Doormen‚Ä¶"
December 2014,A lovely stay,"I have stayed at this hotel previously but not for a couple of years and it was great to go back.  My wife and I arrived on a very wet Friday night to be met by the very friendly doorman who has been working at Browns for years. We had booked an Executive Room for two nights and we were upgraded to a Junior Suite, which was lovely. My only criticisms was that drinks in the hotel are exorbitant for example for a jug of Pimm's & Lemonade I was charged ¬£96.  My wife and I also ate in the hotel restaurant Hix on the Saturday night and we both had a very disappointing meal not helped by the restaurant Manager who had attitude and reminded me of the lead actor in Faulty Towers having a rude moment with customers, perhaps dealing with customers is not his strong point and he needs to‚Ä¶"
June 2015,Wow!,If you are looking for a hotel in London I defiantly suggest Browns hotel. Here's why first of all the service is splendid. They are so kind to everyone and it is a great hotel for grown ups and children. When we came back to the hotel they had baked ginger bread cookies with our names on them. They also have a library and more. The rooms are great perfect for a stay in London. I recommend Browns hotel for sure.
July 2015,Old school charm,I have only ever used the bar here but the staff are great such a friendly escape from the hustle and bustle  It's a great place to meet people have a nice drink I must allow more time to go to the restaurant next visit
June 2015,Wonderful hotel!,"This is a wonderful hotel in the heart of Mayfair. Great service, nicely decorated and superb experience! We decided to stay here as we also had a similiar experience in Berlin at Hotel Rome. Don't miss!       "
June 2015,Classic character downstairs upstairs a surprise!,"I have put off writing this review to try to consider my feelings which are mixed. We have known the pubic areas of Brown's for many years and consider it a favourite in London for afternoon tea, Brunch, a drink or a pop in. The staff and service is superb. We stayed a couple of nights last December as a surprise for my husband's 60th birthday. The downstairs stuff was divine as ever including afternoon tea with surprise guests and brunch with more. I was terribly disappointed with the room though. It was huge which was great and the bathroom was also large and well appointed, But it was horribly over-modernised and corporate and frankly reminded me in style of a Premier Inn which was so different to the lovely clubby wooden traditional feel of downstairs that it was a shock.‚Ä¶"
July 2015,When only the best will do.,"Browns Hotel in Mayfair reaches that level. From the time you walk in the front door until you leave, you are treated as someone special. Nothing is too much trouble.  Share that special moment at the Hotel they will not let you down.       "
June 2015,wonderful hotel,"My wife and I experienced a wonderful stay at Brown's Hotel. As I heve been satying at Brown's for more then 40 Years It is allways a place where I feel coming back home. The only downside ist the outdated air conditioning system in the guetsroom. It can not be adjusted properly -  a strong draft flows troughout the room - therefore I did catch a cold after the third night. Unfortunately windows can not be opened. And if, you are faced with the steet noise ! "
May 2015,Best of the Best,"We just completed our second stay in less than a month. Superb service, excellent food, classic England comes to life. The concierge can make almost anything happen and the bellmen and valets provide a one of a kind service. Our rooms were well appointed and very quiet. We have stayed here in the past and will always stay here in the future. Central location to everything you want to do. "
June 2015,charming and well located,"We just spent about a week at Brown's. Service was impeccable. The concierges are fantastic and pleasant. The bar/tea room was quaint and lovely. You could navigate from the hotel and do quite a lot without even having to take the ""tube"". Breakfast buffet was very nice in the HIX restaurant. I would stay away from having a real meal in the restaurant though as we found the food mediocre and expensive. Our room was spacious and had a very large bathroom with two sinks and a shelf to set up private toilet articles. Sadly the room was not as ""charming"" as I had hoped and was a bit ""motel like"" in decoration. Nice touch: a series of interesting books in the room! Great shoe shine service free of charge. Not sure what other rooms were like. We had a day and a half without the‚Ä¶"
June 2015,Disappointing High Tea,"We went to Brown's with high expectations for a truly authentic and stunning London High Tea experience.  All started off well, and fell apart as the experience continued.  We paid for an upcharge for a champagne tea for two. After our cake was served, we were left alone for half an hour with dirty plates on our table that we had not touched for that half hour, as well as empty tea pots and champagne glasses.  Finally, when the manager came by to ask if everything was OK, we explained the situation.  She offered a glass of champagne in their bar as compensation which we declined.  We were supposed to receive large macaroons (2) to take away if we desired.  Finally they brought one small cookie in a box for us to take away.  The manager took 25% off the bill.  Even if she had not‚Ä¶"
July 2014,Amazing !,Amazing stay at Brown's - went back for first time since our wedding night 15 years previous and were made to feel so welcome and at ease by all the staff. A special mention must go to Bonnie who treated us to a gift in recognition of our celebration - Brown's are lucky to have an employee who recognises the importance of such gestures in this day and age.
June 2015,"Genuinely kind, competent service and all-around excellence","We experienced some of the best service we have had, _ever_, at Brown's. The genuinely friendly, kind, and competent staff made us feel welcome, and really went out of their way to make sure that we were comfortable and had any help that we needed.  Just a few examples of the non-standard, beyond-the-call-of-duty service we received: 1. Massive help receiving and forwarding luggage (from other hotels, and to our home in a different country); 2. Extreme kindness when I was felled by a massive migraine on the day of our departure (and felt so unwell that we needed to stay another night); 3. Stepping out into the street (from the front desk) to make sure we didn't lose our way; 4. Locating speciality shops for us (we were shopping for a wedding gift for a dear friend and wanted‚Ä¶"
January 2015,Return to Browns,"We absolutely appreciate this wonderful hotel. We do, however, find it a bit unusual that having shown such loyalty to the Rocce Forte brand, we do  not seem to be shown any real recognition in return. Who else from Australia has stayed at Browns, Balmoral, Verdura and Hotel de Rome?"
June 2015,Decadent afternoon treat,"Organised birthday trip for my partner which included afternoon tea at the English tea rooms at Browns. Did a bit of research and it was widely acclaimed in the telegraph afternoon teas review so thought we'd give it a go.  You need to book in advance as this is a bucket list the of visit, also don't be put off by the dress code email either, it is smart but casual and rightly so but certainly not trainers and football shirt!!!! The staff are extremely courteous and helpful and the choice of teas and cakes is wonderful. You pay for what you get and at Browns you get culture, good food, ambience and style and for a once in a lifetime treat you need to go for it !!!"
June 2015,One of my Favorites ,Browns hotel is for sure one of my favorite hotels. The service is fantastic. As soon as I entered the room there were gingerbread cookies and hot milk at the side of my bed. Everyone there was very helpful and kind. The hotel is built and a great location close to lots of landmarks. 
June 2015,Room with a view,"Well I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with my recent stay here  I've known of Browns for many years and have always avoided staying but got stuck due to the availability of other hotels   What a really nice hotel, feels a bit like a boutique as opposed to part of a chain was also really pleased to find it wasn't as stuffy as I thought and unlike the Mayfair wasn't full of Russian business men   The rooms are smaller than places like the landmark but it's very refreshing to be able to go shopping and be able to drop bags back at the hotel within a few minutes walk   I would recommend this for romance or shopping "
May 2015,"Great Location, Great Service!","I highly recommend Brown's, the service was great, location perfect and the rooms are cozy/modern. It's infraestruture it's very london syle. The restaurant serves great food. The only inconvenience would be its cost."
May 2015,Very good hotel in the heart of London.,"From our arrival, when staff appeared from the hotel to help with our luggage, until we left for the airport, with luggage already loaded, the staff at Brown's made the visit rather special. Nothing was too much trouble, and making this a home from home was the objective, and it was well achieved. Hix Restaurant provided an excellent breakfast, and when we decided to dine there, again it was wholesome, well cooked, prepared and served. Room was comfortable, and the hotel has character - loads of it! I have a feeling that we'll be back......"
May 2015,Excellent hotel,"Nice and cosy. Well located near bond street. Service is really excellent Rooms are rather nice but some are bigger than others also views will depend.  First time I had a nice street view , the following trip I had a view in the internal court (more noisy)   Hotel more for business than family  "
June 2015,anniversary break,"I don't write reviews very often, but wanted to after a nice relaxing break at Browns Hotel.  Set away from the hustle and bustle of London's Piccadilly but very centrally located, Browns Hotel is old with a twist of modernity to keep it up to date with other hotels in its class.  The staff were very attentive and made you feel special, without being too pushy.  We were made to feel very special and all our requests were swiftly accommodated. Thank you to the bar manager who saved us a lovely table for my sister in law to enjoy a birthday cocktail.  Many thanks."
May 2015,Great hotel in London,I think Browns is the best hotel option in Mayfair. Great atmosphere. The concierge desk is the best I've experienced anywhere. They gave fantastic recommendations for dining and shows and very efficient to get us reservations in tough places              
May 2015,First Rate in Mayfair,"This is a wonderful hotel, reputedly the oldest in London. Comprised of a series of adjacent townhouses the rooms have been redone in a contemporary manner - spacious bedrooms and sitting rooms and luxurious bathrooms! The staff is super -very attentive and friendly. Bond St. shops are right round the corner and Buckingham Palace is a short stroll through Green Park. Not cheap but well worth the money! I'd stay here again in a second!"
May 2015,"Excellent atmosphere, style and location","Excellent place to stay in London - a true luxury hotel with a very personal touch and atmosphere. Great rooms with very good facilities, including large bathrooms. Staff is outstanding, and always helpful and smiling.       "
November 2014,Understated luxury in the heart of London,"Myself and my partner have been fortunate enough to stay at this amazing hotel twice before in the last 18 months so we were looking forward to this, our third stay. There was simply nothing to disappoint. People are so important in every industry, none moreso than the hospitality sector and so I feel its important to highlight just how friendly, professional and helpful all the staff at Browns are, or certainly have been in our experience. From check in to dining, to seeking help, nothing is too much trouble. The room is incredibly stylish, the bed wonderfully comfortable and all those little touches like the quality of bedlinen, the discreet lighting, the decor and an amazing bathroom, just take the strain out of travelling and make you want to linger here longer than your‚Ä¶"
May 2015,Superb,"Browns is a wonderful home whilst in London. I love this hotel, the bar, Hix and the staff who cannot do enough assist. Its stylish and familial at the same time. From specially mixed cocktails to the kippers at breakfast you will enjoy every minute."
May 2015,Great hotel,This is a great hotel near Bond Street and fFortnum and Masons and Libertys . Food is excellent and rooms large and very clean with great bathrooms . Staff are very pleasant and go out of there way to be helpful . I will definitely stay there again
May 2015,The essential London!,The Brown's Hotel is quintessential London. It does not have a herd mentality or the snobbery found at many chain 4 and 5 star hotels. There is a personal touch to everything they do there. The location could not be any better. It is now my absolute favorite hotel in London. Impeccable hospitality and attention to detail no matter now large or small the issue.
May 2015,Best Hotel,"I stayed in this hotel twice and I plan on staying there again, as I visit London more frequently to view houses for when I move there in August. The Lobby is really pretty and the rooms are stunning as well. It also has a restaurant, which gives you the full London experience"
May 2015,No. 1 Hotel in London for us,"My Husband & I stayed at Browns Hotel in London for 2 nights over the Bank Holiday weekend.  This was a gift to us for our Ruby Wedding Anniversary.  The Hotel upgraded us to a Junior Suite which was amazing.  We sat over breakfast on our last morning trying to think of one negative point about this Hotel & its Staff.  There was NOTHING we could think of. The place and its Staff were immaculate with nothing out of place.  This being the sort of Hotel that‚Äôs really out of our league we thought we might be out of our depth but every member of Staff were kind, courteous & helpful.  They made us feel so welcome.  Every little thing to make our stay enjoyable was done with the minimum of fuss.  It is in the perfect spot to explore the West End of London.  If you are staying in London‚Ä¶"
May 2015,London Experience,The Browns Hotel is everything you imagine when you think about London! Excelent service and location!! Friendly and  professional staff and in the heart of Mayfair.  My favourite hotel in London so far.              
April 2015,"True English hospitality , staff that aim to exceed your expectations & a fine five stars accommodation",The staff & management are the key factor for making my staying as pleasant as it was .. the way they look after details really impressed me. The accommodation itself was nice. The attitude of the hotel exceeded my expectation .. they offered many complementary things .  Love the hotel & love the staff  
August 2014,Browns hotel London's luxury friendly,"I stayed here recently on business and it was a 5 star luxury experience without the unfriendly staff you can often encounter in premium hotel properties. The location is perfect, staff wonderful and food was delicious. The bar is also a cool little hideaway perfect for important but intimate business meetings or drinks with friends.       "
May 2015,Very British and stylish in London,"A true taste English culture ! Located in Mayfair, and just moments away from the famed Bond Street boutiques, Dover Street Market. I very much enjoy the Rocco Forte collection hotels especially for their elegance; modernity and style. the room was perfect with Wi-Fi, interactive entertainment, iPod docking stations as well as bathrooms in Bush hammered limestone and more... The service is indeed outstanding. Must try the traditional tea experience...so British !! and Mark Hix restaurant that cooks a perfect modern British cuisine."
May 2015,London Hotels at their best,"A lovely stay at Brown's - intimate top class hotel, Arriving was perfect and no hassle with the Doorman taking care of our car. Gorgeous room and service as always was exceptional. Professional but personal service and a stunning building and location thank you       "
May 2015,I was robbed,"I was robbed by the house keeper, and the manager in duty failed to help me and there was no cameras in my room corridor to proof that happened, as it was a do not disturb sign and she still went in the room while I was in the shower."
May 2015,Magnificent !!,"This lovely old establishment is so British traditional. You truly taste the culture of England.  From the beautifully appointed rooms, luxury sheeting. Very comfy beds.  The in room menu typifies famous British culinary delights. Location ! Its right in the middle of everything. Mayfair. You can walk to any top restaurant, attractions and Famous Parks. The shopping in Bond street is not for the 'faint hearted'. If you appreciate the finer things in life then 'Browns' is your destination hotel in London and also because it is boutique , it is private and luxurious. they attend to your every whim!..  We always stay when travelling to London."
May 2015,Nowhere better,"Home from home! Staff wonderful, think of everything, nothing a problem. Location fantastic but also quiet. Relaxing - even though really busy, controlled ambiance. Staff not afraid to show personality and humour but so professional. Enjoyed every minute of our two night stay"
May 2015,Very Personalised Service,"A lovely stay at Brown's - intimate top class hotel, it was a last minute decision to go and have a late supper in London.  Arriving was a very personalised affair with the Doorman knowing exactly who we were and taking care of us and our car - Thank You              "
May 2015,Home from Home,"I consider Browns a home from home-the location is perfect The reception and concierge staff are friendly,highly efficient and professional The breakfast is first class and good value for money The bed and bathroom make the stay comfortable despite the age of the property The gym is small but as long as few guests use it I found it functional My only complaint would be that the bar staff were somewhat aloof and tended to treat high-spending walk-in groups (in the area for dining) better than hotel guests "
May 2015,Best service in london,"The location is in Mayfair. Great place! Close to many restaurants, quiet, stylish- the best location you can find! Rooms are new! But their biggest advantage is the staff! They are nice, helpful and welcoming. Always try to help and give you a feeling they really care. A Mandarin Oriental style of service but less expensive. They are the reason we will definitely cone back!!!"
May 2015,Excellent management of property by Mr. Johnson!,"This is by far the best hotel in London! Mr. Johnson run's a team of people who are completely committed in meeting the high quality of hospitality that is expected from this land of Kings and Queens! A special note and mention of appreciation of Mr. Nick Davies, Mr. Alasdair Turnbull and Mr. Russel!"
April 2015,Great Stay,"Had a fantastic and unfortunately short stay at the beautiful Brown's Hotel, in a perfect setting for all the main spots in central London.  The hotel feels small and intimate with friendly and efficient staff who make you feel very welcome.  Lovely contemporary furnishing incorporated into a traditional interior, with a cosy feel but spacious. The breakfast menu is great in the Hix restaurant with walls adorned with artwork by famous artists. Highly recommend a stay at Brown's!"
March 2015,Brilliant location for a weekend of art and shopping,"Brown's does what so few London hotels do well -- mixing a historical location with contemporary interiors and service.  A friend and I stayed here for a weekend of gallery and museum-hopping plus a bit of shopping and were delighted.  The rooms are generously sized, with comfortable beds and spacious bathrooms, and we loved the large-sized REN toiletries and little hand cream or other treat on our pillows every evening.  The concierge was extremely helpful in recommending and booking restaurants, although afternoon tea as well as evening drinks in the Donovan Bar are great experiences within the hotel.  All the staff we encountered were articulate, professional and on the ball.  Right around the corner from the auction houses and galleries in Mayfair as well as fantastic‚Ä¶"
January 2015,Best hotel i have stayed in! ,"I have just spent bank holiday at the hotel and i felt like royalty!  The staff are super kind and will do anything to make your life easier and your stay more enjoyable!  The rooms are kitted out with everything you could need and the used items are replaced asap!  Every night the staff would come round and organise your room for ""bed time "" e.g draw the curtains, take the throws off the bed, lay your slippers next to the bed and provide you with a day cream and a bottle of complimentary water.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would not hesitate to come back or recommend!!! "
February 2015,A haven of calm in an excellent location with exceptional service,"We arrived to a warm welcome at reception where we were efficiently checked in without feeling rushed.  We had arrived early with the intention of dropping off our bags however the room was almost ready and so we had a drink in the bar while we waited.  When we had finished we were shown to our room and provided with useful information about in-room amenities and the hotel. The rooms are elegantly designed with good quality materials and are wonderfully comfortable.   In addition to the beautiful hotel and great location however, it was the staff who really define Brown's as outstanding. The staff were genuinely friendly and attentive and nothing was too much trouble; this level of exceptional service really made our relaxing weekend in London and we can't wait to come back."
March 2015,Excellent service,My partner has severe breathing difficulties and has limited mobility. All of the staff at the hotel were exceedingly he!pful and nothing was too much trouble. The hotel has a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. The In-Room dining and turn-down service  is extremely good and staff are very efficient.
February 2015,4.5 Stars Rounded Up,"Everything about the hotel is tremendous, but it's not perfect and I didn't have the heart to round down to a four. We stayed in a junior suite the room was great and the turn down service was exceptional. Here is why it is not a perfect five stars: 1) though the rooms are well done the hallways themselves are tacky and do not exude five stars 2) the reception area is in an awkward location and is not welcoming, though the staff was fine 3) we had a rather crotchety bar tender the only time we went into the bar (Monday March 9th Evening) and that was our first service experience in London. He was just rude, which we were expecting in Paris but did not expect in London, not sure if he was just having a bad night or he's always like that but it certainly stuck with me. 5 star‚Ä¶"
February 2015,Great hotel in central London,"Was lucky enough to stay here, having had fond memories of it in my grandparents' time, and really enjoyed it.  It is a superb location, near museums, galleries, shopping etc., and the staff were extremely professional, courteous and always helpful.  The curious thing about the downstairs is that the lobby is basically a passage from the entrance on one street to entrance on the other, which doesn't leave anyone an easy place to sit when waiting for friends to come down elevator.  The rooms that I saw were oddly lacking in charm, very spacious and every comfort and luxury one could possibly think of, but depressing colours and arrangement of furniture."
February 2015,Very Nice Hotel,"My stay at Brown's was overall a very good one.   The hotel has a lot going for it. Great location in regards to access to shopping and sightseeing and I found the service to be friendly and courteous.   The breakfast in the hotel was of excellent standard. The room I had on the fifth floor was comfortable and nice. The only issue for me was the the noise coming from the squeaky floorboards outside my room when someone would walk by.   While in Asia you can find five star hotels which can be better in regards to what they offer for the same price as this hotel, I would rate Brown's as one of the best hotel stays I had in Europe so far.   "
February 2015,Service needs improvement,"I stayed at the suite for four nights, and while the suite was spacious and tastefully design, I found the overall service lacking. Especially the reception. Unlike other hotels, I was not briefed about details like where breakfast will be served, what services does the suite come with, facilities in the suite...the basics.   Breakfast selection is rather limited, and the spread remained the same throughout my stay. They do pretty good afternoon tea though, but I highly recommend booking in advance if you're planning to have it during weekends.   Location is great as it gives you access to Albermarle and Dover Street, and is just a walking distance to Fortnam & Mason along Piccadilly. The room is very comfortable and I do like the turn down service offered.  When I checked out,‚Ä¶"
February 2015,"Our wonderful first visit wasn't a fluke, the second time was just as good",Second time around and Browns just gets better and better. This time we ate at HIX and had the most delicious crispy fresh fish and chips imaginable. As always the bedroom and the bed were extremely comfortable and well appointed. The staff were very helpful and gracious and made us feel like old friends even though it was only our second time there. The cocktail bar is fun and funky and has a wonderful and diverse range of cocktails including one named after Sir Alexander Graham Bell who made the worlds first telephone call from Browns! I have very high standards and I have no hesitation recommending Browns
January 2015,Great Stay,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay over Valentines weekend. Within a stone's throw of top London restaurants, the hotel truly offers a 10/10 service. Will certainly be back in future and will be recommending to friends and family."
January 2015,Top class hotel,"I use to work at this hotel on reception about 30 years ago and my husband booked a stay here as a valentine surprise, which was lovely.  When we arrived, Michael on reception gave us a tour to show how the hotel has changed since I worked there which was really nice of him.  It has hardly changed in a way as still has a lovely traditional atmosphere about it.  It's still delightfully 'posh' and has been beautifully updated.  Our room was lovely and I liked the little touches of moisturiser on the pillow instead of chocolates.  We were visited by staff who asked if we wanted fresh apples in the afternoon which was a lovely touch.  Staff more than helpful and friendly as I remember them all to be when I worked there. Lovely hotel, I was so happy to return there, it just has such‚Ä¶"
January 2015,an amazing stay,"My girlfriend an I had the chance to stay in this beautiful property in the hart of Mayfair during S. Valentin week-end. The room was very quiet and comfortable, the service tailor-made and made our stay a unique experience."
January 2015,Fab valentines treat,"I stayed here last weekend for a night away with my wife. We started with the champagne afternoon tea - service was great and my wife loved the fruit scones.   We stayed in a classic room, which was larger than expected and looked just like the website. The bathroom was very smart and the large mirror was a great feature.   We did not dine in the hotel, instead choosing Hakkasan nearby (well worth a visit).   Breakfast was very relaxed and I'd recommend the 'egg soldiers' with sourdough.  Overall a romantic night away in a hotel that felt luxurious without being over the top. Only downside is the price, but it was definitely worth it."
March 2014,Luxury in Mayfair,I stayed in the hotel recently when visiting London on a business trip. The room was elegant and very comfortable. Good range on the breakfast menu and staff were happy to accommodate my preferences. I only had one evening meal in the hotel but it was very high quality and the service was outstanding. I will certainly stay again when I next visit London.
January 2015,"OK, But There Are Better Places To Stay In London","A difficult review to write as Trip Advisor does not have a good rating. I would not rate  the hotel as very good ,hence the average rating.Check in was fine and there was a pleasant doorman to greet us.We had booked a classic room which was clean and comfortable but very basic and small with that view, as some others have commented on ,to  a cold looking courtyard and air conditioning vents, as the manager states in other reviews, 60% do not have that view ,not much consolation if you are in one of the remaining 40% .The room did not have tea and coffee making facilities ,but this was remedied when I expressed surprise and a tray was brought up to the room .There was no complementary water in the room ,which I would expect from a hotel of this class. The bed was comfortable‚Ä¶"
January 2015,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed at this hotel with my family and was awesome. Super clean, large room, staff very welcoming and warm. Brilliant location, few strolls away of everything. Delightful ambience and tasty breakfast full of everything you may need in the morning. Recommended 100%."
December 2014,Super Hotel,"Brown's made London even more fun than it already is. The service was impeccable at all levels. If something didn't work, such as a movie, they credited it immediately. Friendly and knowledgable, all our questions were answered with a smile. Johnny, one of the doormen, was fantastic."
January 2015,Perfect London stay,"The weather was awful but the hotel was fantastic. Very clean room, spacious bathroom, top amenities and very good range of food and drinks. We loved everything about our stay, once we tried the spa which was nothing wow, but quite ok, slightly on the pricey side."
December 2014,"SUPERB, SUPERB, SUPERB","Check-in such a nice, easy ,smooth, smiling process what a pleasure. Rooms are cosy , not over the top but tend to give a home away from home feeling. Spa treatments incredible, even though the spa is very small the therapists are extremely well trained.  Concierge tries to accomodate complicated requests with ease. Breakfast was good, would encourage the maitre d' to less brusque but maybe that comes with his territory.    Loication seconds away from Bond Street ."
January 2015,A whole new meaning to excellence ...,"Last weekend I had the privilege of staying at Browns.. Having just arrived back from a two week trip in Thailand where luxury is considered common place, my family and I took a short stay up in London to visit the theatre and museums. First question; where to stay? Browns was the answer... What a treat on every level...I was reminded  of what true excellence is. The moment we arrived on the door step we were greeted with a welcome that was stunningly professional but at the same time warm and  friendly. Then we were shown, to the reception,  around the hotel, up to the room and then to the restaurant. I can honestly say I have never, in a single hotel, experienced true excellence in every area quite like this. There is normally one or two things that can ever so slightly taint‚Ä¶"
December 2014,Outstanding,"I am going to keep this short and sweet. Browns is exceptional in every way.   The rooms, the food, the staff, the location.    It's a superb luxury 5 star experience. Certainly, the best london hotel we have ever had the pleasure of staying in.   So in a word, faultless."
December 2014,A truly excellent hotel.,"A superb experience from the moment we were greeted by the doorman 'til the moment we left. All the staff young and old present as courteous, professional with even the youngest displaying a level of confidence rarely seen. If I have any criticism at all it would be to provide Nespresso machines or similar in the rooms, coffee sachets do no favours to such an illustrious hotel! We will return and would happily recommend this hotel to anyone looking for understated luxury in the heart of Mayfair."
December 2014,Excellent Hotel in Mayfair,"Our family of five enjoyed a wonderful stay at Brown's Hotel over Christmas and New Year's 2014. We had two deluxe rooms next door to each other. The children were so spoiled! Cookies and milk everyday. Over Christmas the hotel delivered embroidered stockings filled with goodies for each child.   Adults also enjoyed the gorgeous, comfortable room (everything recently renovated.) We received a complimentary bottle of champagne our first night.   The breakfast everyday at Hix was excellent. We also enjoyed tea at the hotel and a lovely hotel lunch one day.  The concierge was incredibly helpful with reservations at restaurants and even helped us get transportation to the Harry Potter studio.   Overall, excellent hotel; excellent location;  excellent service. Will definitely stay‚Ä¶"
December 2014,A 7 star service with a Smile!,"We often travel to London, yet this was our very first time at the Rocco Forte Brown's Hotel.  This place could not fault in any way, thanks to its brilliant position, its ""British-Italian"" atmosphere and moreover thanks to its well trained, professional, courteous and always smiling staff.  Our overall experience at the Brown's hotel made our last trip to London a very special one and can not wait to be back.  Hats off to all...from the Island of Malta."
December 2014,Trapped in the bathroom was AOK,"Only stayed 2 days but Browns will stay with us as a highly recommended hotel. Remarkably friendly staff, excellent accomodation, wonderful location, it really couldn't have been better. Son Pat was trapped in his bathroom for an hour when the door handle failed. He managed to extricate himself like the Apollo 13 astronauts and frankly it couldn't have been funnier. Browns gave him a bottle of bubbles and we sat around laughing and I'm guessing so did the staff. A great hotel where you can 'feel' the history all around you. We'll certainly be back."
December 2014,Fabulous,An amazingly friendly hotel. Staff couldn't be too helpful. A surprise birthday cake too! Beautifully decorated for Christmas and ofcourse in an incredible location for access to the sights of London. We wanted a special hotel but not one that was too pretentious and that's just what we got. Couldn't recommend it highly enough.
February 2014,Good Old Fashioned Fantastic Service - What a Gem!,"We stayed for the weekend for a shopping and theatre going weekend.  Arrived on Friday lunchtime and from the moment we approached the hotel we could not fault the fantastic service we were given by all the staff.  They couldn't do enough for you but not in a pretencious way (which you can sometimes experience in luxury hotels).  We had a drink in Donovan's Bar - possibly the best Bloody Mary I have ever had.  Our room was very clean, and although not the largest of rooms, it was a good size for London!  The location is brilliant, easy access to all the West End shops and a lovely walk through the park to Knightsbridge and all it has to offer.  I have stayed in a lot of hotels in London but can honestly say I will definitely be heading back to Browns."
November 2014,Going 'the extra mile',"I booked Afternoon Tea for my wife's 65th birthday, and mentioned this when booking.  We were not disappointed - from the friendly reception (though we were more than half an hour early!) to the friendly and efficient service and the quality of the food.  The 'extra mile' was that my wife has many food intolerances, so was unable to eat the cakes, so without any notice they produced crumpets and teacakes - and even brought one of the crumpets with a candle in, and with 'Happy 65th Birthday' piped round the rim of the plate! Full marks for helping to make it such a very special occasion."
November 2014,A FREE night so whats not to like!,"As a member of the leading hotels of the world programme we had clocked up our Free Night stay. Neither the ritz or landmark could supply a room! So Browns it was.   Our welcome was very friendly and our allocated room excellent. The location of the hotel was great with lots of bars, pubs & restaurants in walking distance. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant but enjoyed a night cap in the Donovan Bar. The drinks were nicely prepared and the nibbles good. We had breakfast in the morning which was good. All be it my ""Irish"" bacon sandwich tasted greasy but my husband eggs Benedict was  excellent.   Next time we are in London we look forward to staying at Browns. Many thanks to all the team."
November 2014,Amazingly disappointing,"New to Browns and was looking forward to experiencing one of londons best 5 star hotels. Sadly for me it came nowhere close to our favourites of the firmdale group, savoy, W and the Corinthia.   We checked in early as had spa treatments booked so the rooms were not ready. Not a huge problem but no real assistance in getting ready ahead of our treatments. The spa was nice.   We had a room on the 4th floor, very average but with a lovely big bathroom. Our room had no double glazing so had the worst nights sleep, it was like there was no window at all between us and the outside.   The most disappointing thing about Browns for me is the staff and service. I never really felt welcome, if anything more an inconvience. People make a hotel and sadly for Browns this won't be a home from‚Ä¶"
October 2014,Surprise valentines evening,"My hubby booked this as a surprise valentines evening, ate in the restaurant was lovely & the bar was excellent food selection of cocktails & whisky. Well worth the money as it is quite costly but you definitely get what you pay for, great service, good food & drink & if you are very lucky you might see someone famous! Sadly we didn't! X"
August 2014,one of the best,"As a businessman I have to travel quite a lot back and forth to London and this time I had the opportunity to stay in this hotel. I can say that it has been a good stay from start to finish albeit a very short one. Unfortunately I only had the chance to have breakfast which was really good, with excellent service. Highly recommend this hotel as one of the top in London! Will visit again."
September 2014,"Wonderful, Welcoming Hotel","Brown`s is a wonderful, welcoming hotel which is highly recommended.  Our executive room was the largest we`ve had in London.  It included a bed, coffee table, couch and chair.  The furniture and decorating were comfortable, but not luxurious.  There was a separate hall which led to the large bathroom including separate tub and shower.  The room faced in inner courtyard which meant that it was very quiet.   We spent six nights there and were impressed by the level of attention put into making our stay comfortable.    There was a continual effort by the staff to ensure that we were comfortable and had everything that we needed.  Staying at Brown‚Äôs felt curiously like staying with relatives, as was remarked by Agatha Christie.  We will be back."
September 2014,What a fantastic anniversary!,"My wife and I like to celebrate our wedding anniversary every year by visiting Paris or London for a weekend without the children. We stayed at Browns hotel on the Saturday night, after spending the previous night at very large premium hotel near Kensington as part of a function. After having a very pleasant night at the previous hotel, we arrived at Browns around lunchtime and then really started to enjoy our weekend. On arrival the staff were genuinely friendly with a personal touch and from the moment that we arrived, their mission was to make sure we enjoyed our stay. I emailed the hotel earlier in the week to arrange some treats on arrival and mentioned it was our wedding anniversary -  I am so glad I did, as the hotel staff could not do enough for us. For a start we were‚Ä¶"
September 2014,Afternoon tea at Brown's,"I had afternoon tea here a few days ago, for a friend's 40th birthday and it was absolutely lovely.  They catered very well for vegetarians, and also took into account that I can't eat tomatoes or hazelnuts.  The service was fantastic, and even though it's obviously a very well-to-do place, they were still friendly and personable.  My friend had a great time, and we all had a great afternoon.  Lovely sandwiches (though I do wonder what they do with all the crusts?!), yummy scones, and petite cakes that were gorgeous.  Everything was well presented, a large selection of teas to choose from, and we left feeling very satisfied."
September 2014,Nice Way to End a Cruise!,Brown is a charming hotel centrally located in London. We found their staff to be very friendly and competent.  Enjoying afternoon tea at Brown is a beautiful way to experience  British tradition.  I would have liked our room to have been more traditional in keeping with the rest of Brown's ambiance.
September 2014,Wonderful stay in London!,We have returned to Brown's for one night or several days and never disappointed. We are usually upgraded and the staff is exceptional.  The location is central in London and wonderful just to take a walk around even after dinner.  The food at Brown's in delicious and the  tea time a must. I look forward to our next stay at Brown's.
September 2014,Excellent Service!,"We stayed one night celebrating our wedding anniversary and i must say this has been one of the best hotels i have stayed in London. On arrival we were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to a suit! On return from our dinner we were even more surprised when the room was nicely decorated with rose petals which just top off what was a fantastic day for us! The location was brilliant, we walked everywhere we needed, the staff were friendly, helpful and warm. The breakfast was amazing and i have been dreaming about it ever since! All in all, ill give this more than an excellent if there was such a rating! Will surely return!"
December 2013,Afternoon Tea - how it ought to be,"Just wonderful, from the food to the pianist. Just the right ambiance, refined and understated. I'm British but if I were a foreign tourist, I'd be delighted by the 'Britishness' of this place.  Fabulous sandwiches, small cakes, way too many scones (they brought five scones per person. Yes, five). Ample amount of Cornish clotted cream, and a choice of two cakes from the trolley. Food replenished discreetly, not that it's really required after all of that!  Definitely better than the afternoon tea I've had at Fortnum and Mason, just because it's cosier. The only thing I didn't like was that the chairs are very low - I prefer to eat at a normal height table; but it's no problem really."
September 2014,Recent stay at Brown's,"We just stayed 6 nights at Brown's.  The location is excellent, very close to Green Park, Green Park tube station, many art galleries and the fabulous shops on Bond Street and the surrounding back streets.  This was a very comfortable stay - the staff are very discrete, welcoming and unpretencious.  Afternoon tea with our friends was excellent, as always.  It's also very secure with footmen on the front door and 2 or 3 security guys on the back.  The food in the attached HIX Restaurant was very good, but there are many fabulous restaurants within a very short walking distance.  I was a bit disappointed with the executive level room that I booked - smaller than I had expected for the price and in need of an update compared to other hotels of this standard around the world.  I‚Ä¶"
November 2014,Exceptional service even better food.,"I held 2 training days here and the service was exceptional, really personalised. The refreshments were always on time and hot. The food was amazing, tasty, hot, cooked to perfection. I will be visiting here again for social as well as arranging further training here. "
October 2014,Consistently excellent,"I have stayed at Brown's hotel multiple times over the last year both for business and with family.  The experience is consistently excellent.  The rooms are very pleasant, boutique hotel rooms.  Good mid-size gym with plenty of equipment.  Outstanding restaurant.  The service is always first rate.  The concierge, front desk and outside staff go out of their way to be helpful under all sorts of conditions.  I highly recommend this hotel which is in a great location near Piccadilly Circus."
November 2014,Private room for afternoon tea,"Booked a private room for my two sons 13th birthdays. We booked over the internet, as we are from New Zealand and it was no hassle. It was an amazing birthday treat for them, the service was excellent and the food just kept coming. Replenishing our sandwiches and cakes all the time. The food was top notch and nice a fresh. Thanks for helping make such great memories."
November 2014,Afternoon tea,"Expensive, but exceptionally impressive. First class service, truly one hundred percent attentive staff. Comfortable decor , good variety and endless supply of sandwiches and cakes all accompanied by pianist tinkling away on the ivories. Can't wait to return   "
November 2014,Great stay at a chilled hotel in a great location,"Excellent hotel, chilled out and friendly, but with great service. The suite we had was fab, clean and very well laid out. Breakfast seems to be an institution, but Monday to Friday the restaurant is busy with suits rather than residents and as is the bast which gets very busy a the end of the day. Overall a great hotel, superb location and very good staff, the gins and cocktails are pretty good too!"
November 2014,Tea at the Browns,"Had tea at the Browns Hotel. Nice and relaxing experience. Great Service and good quality food.  Would not necessarily go again since there are better places for tea (check the Lanesborough which, for me, is on top of the list)"
November 2014,Wonderful stay,"Stayed here for one night on my birthday last week. A fabulous stay from arrival to departure. All the staff were so friendly and helpful and we were lucky to have our room upgraded which was a very pleasant surprise. An executive room certainly fitted the occasion and was extremely comfortable especially the large bed with lovely crisp bedding and the bathroom was of a good size too. Breakfast was excellent and the choice superb‚Ä¶.wanted it all! Although we didn't partake in full afternoon tea as we had dinner booked for later, the tea and scones were wonderful and the scones very fresh and warm. Thankyou Brown's for a wonderful stay and look forward to returning."
September 2014,"Great location, very nice hotel","We stayed in an Executive room for a couple of nights.  The room was nicely furnished and both it and the bathroom were very spacious by London standards. All staff with whom we interacted provided excellent service.  Breakfast was very good, both in variety and quality.  Two minor things stopped the experience being perfect for me, but I accept that these are completely subjective:  1) I like my rooms to be totally dark, but the curtains let in too much morning light. 2) The mattress was too soft - I like a firm bed.  Overall, however, we had a very enjoyable stay and I would be happy to recommend this hotel."
November 2014,A bit of class,"Afternoon tea at Browns was delightful. The building is traditional with d√©cor to match. All the staff we spoke with were helpful, polite and friendly. The food; a selection of sandwiches, cakes and cream scones  was fresh and very tasty. A piping hot pot of tea was most welcome after walking around town. Definitely one to visit when in London."
November 2014,"Unique, elegant and impeccable service but Donovan bar getting busy and noisy","Brown's is the best hotel I have never stayed at, but I am a habitu√© at the Donovan Bar and it has become my de rigeur social meeting point when I am visiting London over the last 5 years or more and my premier entertaining bar of choice.   I can truly say I have never had a bad service experience at Browns and one cannot fail to be impressed with the standards and excellence displayed by the staff. The ultra professional greeting staff at the door manage to combine olde worlde formality with informal friendliness, impeccable manners and helpfulness and they set the standard for the hotel as soon as you arrive.   Everyone I have ever invited to the hotel for cocktails, drinks or dinner at Hix has relished the atmosphere, service levels and ambience of Browns and I've recommended‚Ä¶"
July 2014,Fabulous location and attention to detail,We stayed for one night at Brown's as we had to be in London to see clients.  Our experience was wonderful.  Upon check in we were upgraded to a superior room (I had read somewhere that this is more likely to happen if you book directly with the hotel rather than through a 'broker' website - and that seemed to pay off!)  The room was wonderful and the REN toiletries and selection of options in the mini bar were excellent. It was a Friday afternoon and the hotel bar was heaving - so we had afternoon tea and that was wonderful.   Great service and scones to die for! I was excited to see the water put out from us was from Blenheim Palace where we had been the week before!!  When we came to check out the following morning we saw a member of staff in the corridor who wished us a good‚Ä¶
July 2014,Excellent service in the cocktail bar,We arrived at Browns after a truly appalling experience at the Ritz Hotel Rivoli Bar.  (See separate review).   The manager and staff were welcoming and most efficient.  The manager quickly found us a secluded area to sit and our order was taken without fuss.  All in all an enjoyable experience
July 2014,The staff make it great!,"We have just spent 4 nights at Browns Hotel in a larger room on the 1st floor on the 'courtyard' side.  There was nothing to look at but some potted hedge plants but there was enough natural light and the huge advantage of a very quiet night.  The rooms are well tarted up and functional with everything you would expect bar tea/coffee making facilities. A great and proper hairdryer rather than one of those horrible wall mounted things though no plug in the bathroom as is standard in the UK and good lighting, makeup mirror, easy operating phone and TV etc.  Would love a bit more hanging space but there is a chest of drawers in the small wardrobe.  Bearing in mind this venerable old lady is just that, old, there are the obligatory squeaks and rattles and some sad paintwork on the‚Ä¶"
July 2014,Afternoon Tea - Very Refined...,"Usual fare for an afternoon tea, and the plates were refilled as often as we asked for them to be, so we left feeling very adequately fed and watered.  My tea was absolutely delicious (Cornish blend), and the staff's attentiveness was spot on for me.  The pianist was really really good - I was entranced by his range of music, and it added a lovely twist to the afternoon.  Highly recommended, and a lot of other people clearly thought so too, as they were full."
May 2014,Hotel In Mayfair,"We recently traveled to London and spent two nights at the Brown Hotel. It is located in the heart of Mayfair, but on a side street so it is quiet.  We were pleasantly upgraded to a larger room and had a small sitting area as well as a beautiful bathroom.  The staff is extremely professional and answered any question with a smile on their face.  As a member of the Leading Hotels of the World we received complimentary breakfast each day which was an English buffet. It was more then enough and the smoked salmon was delicious.    With its great location touring and shopping was only a walk away.  We never had to take a cab except going to the Belgravia area for a walking tour.  Great hotel in great location with 5 star service."
July 2014,Great London hotel,"Stayed here recently and is a great London hotel. The hotel is made up of a series go old town houses and so has the typical charm of an English hotel. Location wise, it is great, just off of Piccadilly, it is a few minutes walk from Piccadilly Circus & Green park, although it's location on Dover Street means that it is nice & quiet - I had a room on the first floor & had very little noise.  The bar has a great cocktail menu - main problem is choosing a drink from the long menu, although the ""in house"" specialist cocktails are recommended "
April 2014,Afternoon Tea at 6:30pm - Perfect,"I felt the experience of an afternoon tea was a necessity for our family's first visit to England.  Time and research got away from me and I made the reservation the day of the seating - a Saturday (the last seating is earlier during the week).  I was right to feel lucky.  The servings there are unlimited but it's good to let your waiter know that you may be interested in another serving.  It was a proper tea with silver flatware and teapots (dripless), crisp white linens with intimate table arrangements.  The room was also visually perfect as I wanted more old english (think medium stained oak paneling/ wainscoting) - deep red, brown or taupe seats of suede or velvet with leather trim rather than crystals and shiny.  The lighting fixtures were a bit of a surprise - midcentury‚Ä¶"
June 2014,Great experience,We thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our visit. The room (upgraded to deluxe) was large and had all of the amenities we wanted. The service everywhere was excellent. We had a late dinner at the hotel restaurant - Hix Mayfair - that was also excellent and had a wide variety of entrees. I had fish and chips and my wife had rack of lamb. The bar was busy and good and we loved that they rebuilt the entire holel but left the main room for afternoon tea as it was.It is probably the best location in London - almost everything was within a relatively short walk - 20 minutes. The buffet continental breakfast was very good. We highly recommend Brown's to everyone.
July 2014,Afternoon delight,"This was a 70th birthday gift from my niece - champagne afternoon tea in London. We chose Brown's as my brother recommended it and were not disappointed. The atmosphere was sophisticated yet welcoming. The staff were attentive and pleasant. They did not rush at all so we were able to relax and enjoy the delicious fare. Dress code stated smart, and we, along with the staff and most of the guests followed this code. However I was disappointed to see some sloppily dressed guests and this spoiled it a little. This was a special day for me and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
October 2014,Home away from home,"Just recently stayed in this hotel and it was amazing. Everything thing about it, service, room, staff... it was great and I will absolutely stay here again. Great location as to not a lot of road noise yet can walk to everything you may need or want. Really great area!"
October 2014,"Browns, Beautiful","When travelling, Our family have a tendency to move between two luxury hotel chains. One is the Shangri-la and the other Rocco Forte. We had chosen Browns as we had started our trip with the Charles in Munich and knew if we were to fly for 24 hours home, we would want to be pampered before hand. Browns certainly didn't disappoint. Arriving on a thursday afternoon, the service was swift from the Concerge and we were in the Hotel in matter of seconds. Served straight away for Check in the children were given their own welcome backs with special request forms for the children. We were personally escorted to our rooms by front desk staff. A Room opposite Tiffanys is always a delight! We were given tours of our room and shown how to use all the amenities. (I really like this as most‚Ä¶"
June 2014,A Memorable Return,"I've stayed at Brown's several times, and have experienced it in different stages of decor and repair. Though the interiors may change, there are constants that do not: Brown's is the quietest, roomiest, loveliest sleep in London. True to its history, it does not feel like a hotel. It feels like a stay in a lovely, highly attentive Mayfair home, with privacy and services. As always, the concierge staff at Brown's is absolutely superb and will do anything needed to help with your stay which they did plenty of for us. The tea service remains remarkable. Again, the best in London. Cozy, welcoming, fresh and delicious. So comfortable and easy to linger over. That said, there was a small stumble at check-in that was overcome. I cannot stress to hotels how important the check-in‚Ä¶"
October 2014,Afternoon tea,"Cheery welcome, and shown to a table, which I thought was in a bit of a corridor area, but husband says was OK.  Table nicely laid with good quality linen.  Wide variety of teas available.  Usual afternoon tea selection - sandwiches, warm scones, mini cakes and Victoria sponge or apple/cranberry cake to finish.  Attentive service, pleasant atmosphere with the pianist tinkling away. Cost ¬£41.50pp plus 12.5% service charge.  Other tables were given samples of the house tea to take away, but we were not.  Maybe next time we will try the Hix restaurant, as we had a fantastic meal at Number One in June. Hotel is well located for Green Park tube and all the best parts of London!"
October 2014,Luxury 5-star hotel in Mayfair on Albemarle Street,Brown's has been owned by Sir Rocco Forte and is a member of The Leading Hotels of the World. Located within walking distance of shopping streets like Bond Street and Regent Street. It also is in walking distance of Green Park and Hyde Park. The staff is very friendly and professional. The rooms combine modern features with traditional furnishing. This hotel can be highly recommended.
January 2014,Fabulous Food & Friendly Place,"We visited the restaurant with friends to celebrate a birthday.  My son was the only non adult in attendance.  The restaurant made everyone feel welcome.  They even brought my son stuff to do at the table to keep him entertained.   The food was amazing.  I had a salmon starter, lamb main and most of us had the amazing chocolate pud with mint ice cream.  The food was really delicous. Would definitely go back."
October 2014,Stylish bar in the heart of Mayfair,I work locally so this is a great place to catchup with friends and colleagues when meeting space is booked out. The Donovan bar is quite dark and can be noisy but the seats are comfortable and the service good. Whilst the drinks prices are scary they are are in keeping with other similar establishments in the area. My martini was excellent and the nibbles more than compensated for the bill.
October 2014,Excellent Management response to a problem.,"On the 14th October I wrote a review about the disappointing Afternoon Tea experience which we had at this hotel.  The response by Nicholas Davies, the hotel Manager has been first class.  All businesses are susceptible to the occasional problem, but it is how they deal with criticism that makes the really good hotel stand out.  Thank you, Mr. Davies for the efficient and very courteous way in which you have responded.  We will return to Brown's when we are next in London."
September 2014,Excellent Rocco Forte hotel experience as usual,We stayed at Browns as a Leading Hotels reward for multiple stays but were treated as well as everyone else. The staff are really friendly and helpful (as we always find at a RF hotel) and the location is excellent. Used the bar which was really buzzy and great fun and breakfast was excellent. Great hotel
October 2014,"Amazing Hotel, fantastic location and great staff! Simply perfect","I stayed in this amazing hotel twice in the last 2 years. Service is amazing, position speech less, just in front of Ritz Hotel and 300 meters from Piccadilly Circus and Oxford Street. Underground station is just 150m from the hotel, Green Park station. Staying there you will have everything necessary in your pocket! Food is delicious and you MUST enjoy afternoon tea in the amazing Tea Room!  Rooms are very well decorated and equipped, Olga Polizzi really knows how to do her job! In conclusion, Brown's Hotel is probably the best hotel in London and not only"
September 2014,Afternoon Tea 12th October 2014,"Firstly a big thank you to the staff for an excellent day celebrating my 66th birthday. Everything was excellent including the service, the tea, the sandwiches, the scones and the final touch of a small birthday cake. I look forward a future visit when I can try out more of your teas. I must say that the Cornwall tea was a delighful surprise. Once again thank you all."
August 2014,"Quality, Class & Warmth","My boyfriend and I only spent one night in this hotel but neither of us wanted to leave!  Upon arrival (having walked past many designer shops on the way, much to my excitement) we found the reception staff polite and welcoming. We had tea in the lounge while waiting for our room (it was only minutes before it was ready but I was enjoying the tea too much) - loose leaf, served in silverware. When shown to our room the first thing that struck us was how bright and plush it was, the decor was fresh without being cold and our room looked out over the designer shops below, plus beautiful architecture opposite. We left to explore the city then on return I bathed in possibly the biggest bath I've ever encountered! For dinner we asked the concierge (Matteo I think) for a Thai‚Ä¶"
September 2013,The hotel is ok  but fire allarm kept ringing and waking everyone up!,I stayed there for 2 nights . One night i could not sleep for the fire allarm that kept on going  on. They did not even give me a discount ! From a hotel like that i would have expected a much better tretement!
August 2014,London at it's best,"London hotels just don't get much better than this. Elegant, surroundings in the heart of Mayfair. Contemporary and traditional furnishings blended perfectly. My room was beautifully traditional except where it counted. Very comfortable bed, beautifully appointed bathroom. I loved the pillow present with the turn down service. Day one after a long flight was perfect.....anti puff eye gel. Day two, a wonderful moisturiser ( it was so good that I bought a full size one). Day three a face pack! Staff couldn't help enough. Breakfast was sublime and my final afternoon was filled by their legendary afternoon tea. My friend told me it had been voted the best in London and I am not at all surprised. I was visiting my son. He had just started university. I must give a special mention to‚Ä¶"
August 2014,Afternoon tea.,"We've had afternoon tea several hotels in London, but Brown's tops our list.  It was relaxed yet elegant, attentive service but quick and discreet, and the scones and sandwiches and tea flowed effortlessly and relentlessly to our beautiful little table.  It was all delicious and beautifully English and was a highlight of our time in London."
August 2014,"So British, so personal","Browns hotel is a favorite in London. Perfect location, welcoming staff, stylish decorated and a georgeous breakfast. I do think the standard rooms are a bit too small for the price though and some with a pretty bad view."
August 2014,Excellent service...and their lattes are THE BEST,"I stayed here with my husband and our three kids.  We were able to get adjoining rooms, which we were thrilled to stay in an older historic hotel and still have adjoining rooms.  This hotel is centrally located, and is really quite nice.  The service is impeccable and the rooms were spacious and very clean.  The breakfast buffet was great with a variety of options for my kids and the lattes in the morning were some of the best I'd ever had.  Maybe it was the jet lag, but I'd go back just for the latte!"
July 2014,"Afternoon Tea, good but not great","Afternoon Tea is one of my real favourite treats & having tried many establishments in London and the home counties I feel that I can honestly report that although this was good, it really was not great & I have had better especially for the price!  The beautiful lounge area, split into three rooms with the pianist is unsurpassable. Spotless crisp linen, ticking every box visually. We had comfortable armchairs by the fireplace, but you may want to ask for a higher table as some are low coffee table styles & sofas which some people would not find easily accessible or comfortable.   There was a lovely welcome and the staff are all delightful. My friend treated me for my Birthday and we had chosen Browns specifically. The sandwiches are all freshly made and yes you can have more‚Ä¶"
August 2014,Fantastic Hotel,We stayed at hotel for 3 nights on a family vacation and the stay was great. The service at the hotel was outstanding. The location was perfect and it was truly enjoyed by the whole family. Keep up the great work!
July 2014,Cosy and central located hotel in London.,"We stayed there 4 days. The hotel lies centrally in Mayfair, so due to dense traffic the taxi ride was about 45 min from the Eurostar station. It lies within walking distance of most shopping areas,historical landmarks and museums. Welcoming doormen and staff, reception lies at the end of the corridor. Check in was fast, we had luxury rooms. Rooms were not shown. Entrance of the rooms was with cardkeys,one to open door  another to put electricity on. The rooms were relatively large,one had inner courtyard view,the other view of Albemarle Street. Rooms have several windows,the one with inner courtyard view faces large walls of the tiny courtyard with on the ground large ventilation tubes somewhat masked by green vegetation in pots, the other one faced the roofs of surroundings.‚Ä¶"
July 2014,Classic Elegance in heart of London,"I have just stayed at Browns Hotel on Albemarle Street in Mayfair for two nights). I was fortunate enough to be in a Junior Suite, which was extremely spacious and beautifully decorated. Upon arrival, there was a tray of petit fours, a fruit basket, bottles of highland water and a bottle of chilled white wine (always a good start!). The staff were particularly attentive (not always the case in 5* hotels) and could not have done more; I would particularly like to single out Stella and Lewis on Reception, James and John on the Concierge Desk and the very tall waiter at breakfast. The air of understated elegance pervades throughout the hotel and guests' requests are met efficiently and timely. The hotel is also in one of the best locations possible in London - in the heart of‚Ä¶"
September 2014,Classy but unpretentious and friendly,"We had wanted to stay at Brown's for a number of years and in particular to have their much praised afternoon tea. My wife' special birthday gave us the excuse to book. Having made the booking we then angst a little on what to wear for afternoon tea and a dinner in Hix Mayfair, and weren't sure if we were going to feel underdressed or out of place. We needn't have worried on both counts as there was a mix of casual and smart dress and from the moment we arrived and jumped out of our cab all the staff were most welcoming and from the start made us feel at home.  Afternoon tea was the quintessential English experience that other reviews have summed up so well. Service was attentive and informative and an afternoon of gentle enjoyment of teas, sandwiches and fine cakes is not to be‚Ä¶"
November 2014,Classy but pricey Mayfair institution,"Everything about Brown's is effortless. This is a confident 5 star establishment that knows its place in firmament of traditional London Hotels. Unlike places like the Ritz its not full of flash wannabes. It just oozes class and sophistication and has an easy charm that comes with confidence in everything they do. Location is second to none. If you choose to stay in a 5 star hotel, in the most expensive part of the most expensive city in Europe you know there will be a commensurate price tag. And it can be eye watering. Not helped by the fact that a service charge is added to everything it seems. I'd say the only minor disappointment is the Hix restaurant. In truth the food is average and a bit staid but you'll pay Michelin Star prices."
November 2014,"An oasis of peace, serenity & luxurious Class !","Brown's Hotel in the heart of Mayfair provided 5 star opulence balanced with friendly, professional staff. We had 2 nights in the hotel , everything from checking in to collecting our bags on departure was handled with great care. We visited with our 12 year old Daughter & 8 year old son, we enjoyed uninterrupted sleep on both nights ( a first for us in a City Hotel )! Having been fortunate to have stayed in most of the capitals top hotels, I feel that Brown's has hit the perfect balance. Congratulations to the management & staff."
September 2014,Excellent but...........,"I want to give this place 5 stars but I cannot.  Overall, this is a classy hotel with excellent service throughout.  Our room was well appointed and very comfortable.  BUT, for the price, there were several flaws.  The TV was old and the channel choices were not as extensive as they should have been.  WIFI service from the desk are of the room was fine but from the bed area it was not nearly what it should have been.  Thus, if you wished to use your IPAD or phone from bed, it was a problem.  Also, there was no coffee maker in the room.  I would certainly stay here again but only if these issues had been addressed.  Overall, I still have to say it is a wonderful hotel."
November 2014,Best in London,"In all my years traveling to London both for personal and work reasons, this special place has become my home away from home. Every last detail is executed with perfection. It is a beautiful place to wake up each morning and truly the best of the best in my opinion. Everything you could want is steps away and what's more, Hix, is just inside and this restaurant delivers an incredible culinary experience surrounded by a fantastically curated art collection. I will never stay anywhere else when in London! "
April 2014,Great Classic hotel In London,"Great hotel, excellent location. One of the best hotel services in London. Classic, upscale but with a family atmosphere. Roos, restaurant and tea room were in line with our high expectations. Not the first time we've been there, but that was longtime ago."
October 2014,Fabulous hotel on a perfect location,"Stayed in this hotel with my partner for four nights. The room was stylish decorated with plenty of space. The staff was very friendly and helpfull. This hotel has the most comfortable beds I've slept in in a hotel.  Only point of attention is the noise of the hotel, you can hear people walking through the corridor when you're in the bathroom and I heard several times noise from above. Nothing really bad, just an old building in the perfect Mayfair district."
November 2014,Great location and outstanding service,"My wife and I were in London for a week and though many times before this was our first time at Brown's. It exceeded our expectations and we plan to return in the Spring, All our needs were met and the concierge went out of his way to help with touring and financial arrangements."
November 2014,Exceptional Service,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Browns Hotel.  We were well looked after and definitely will come back.  We have stayed in many of the ""top"" hotels in London, but the service we had a Browns exceeded the level of service we have had in any other London hotel.    There was nothing we could fault with the hotel.  The service and the quality of the food served in the bar was excellent - so good we went twice in 1 day.    The breakfast was also top quality -  loving the pancakes and bacon which was of similar standards to that of Sarabeth's in New York.  Will definitely be the hotel of choice from now on in London.    If you are thinking of staying in Claridges, The Ritz or The Dorchester, give Browns a try, you will not be disappointed.       Fantastic location for shopping with‚Ä¶"
September 2014,Good location,If you need to stay in Mayfair it's a great spot. I found the rooms a bit confusing. They weren't really quaint and not at all modern. Somewhere lost in the middle. While I wouldn't hesitate to return I might not recommend it without reservation.
September 2014,Quintessentially London,"Having stayed in numerous hotels in London, including the Dorchester and Claridges, we have settled into our London ""home"" of Browns.  Whilst the other hotels have their positives, they are all very large properties, and it is easy to get lost amongst the other guests. i.e. service is not so great at times.  Browns is a much smaller hotel, with a very personal and homely feel about it. Breakfast at Hix is fantastic, a great selection of produce and quality.  The hotel is quite often frequented by royals, who like to keep a low profile. The GM, Stuart Johnson, is an absolute professional and as you would expect, a proper Brit.  Highly recommended."
August 2014,Excellent hotel!,"We had great experience at Brown's for my husband's B-day. We just had Afternoon tea with waiter Stefano. He is super super good, simply the best! Always smiling and friendly. The suite we have got was amazing. Very professional staff. The bartender Agnez was very friendly and helpful. Good location. We will definitely come back."
September 2014,A delightful place to stay,"Had afternoon tea and then stayed for one night. Tea was superb, particularly the healthy option. The room and the ensuite were charming, quiet and spacious although we would have preferred a separate shower rather than one over the bath. The public rooms, including the bar, were cosy rather than grand and the whole effect was one of homeliness. The service, helpfulness and friendliness of the staff were exemplary and they did all they could to make us feel ""at home"". We would happily return for that special occasion."
September 2014,Celebration Tea,"We celebrated our daughter's 18th birthday with Afternoon Tea. The occasion more than lived up to the high standards we hoped for and expected. The Tea was excellent (of course), the pace was relaxed, the service was exemplary and the whole event was topped off by a thoughtful 'birthday cake', complete with 'Happy 18th' in chocolate written on the plate. Our daughter was extremely pleased and it made the day.  Definitely a highly enjoyable and memorable experience - which was the whole point."
September 2014,A 5 star hotel without pretension,"We had a lovely couple of days after flying in from the States - needed to get over the jet lag before going to a party in Surrey.  Lovely room even though it looked onto Albemarle Street, it was quiet. Big bathroom, walk in wardrobe and luxurious bedding. Very good breakfast, with vast choice. Waiting service were friendly and helpful. Donovan Bar - always a great spot to meet with friends for a cocktail or a bottle of Cloudy Bay. All in all a lovely break. This is a classy but unstuffy hotel. Perfect location. Can highly recommend."
September 2014,If only all hotels could be like this...,"We cannot enough positive things about our experience at Browns.   From the point of check-in to check-out, our experience was unforgettable.  The kids children loved the fact that they got to ""check-in"" as well and order ""cookies and milk"" for their bedtime. They upgraded us to a two bedroom suite with an huge living room.The kids room was set up with appropriately sized slippers and bath robes.  The beds were set up perfectly with fun duvets for kids. We had a friend visit who had a 18 month old child.  The hotel provided crib/babies toys and a DIAPER GENIE !!!  Room Service was prompt and of excellent quality. Our every need was taken care of without question with professionalism and courtesy.  We will definitely stay there again !!!!"
August 2014,Absolute Perfection,"I was reluctant to post this review as we would like to keep The Brown's our little secret, but as shown in prior reviews, the ""cat is out of the bag"".  We had the pleasure of staying at The Brown's for 7 nights this past week.  The room was lovely; amazingly quiet, spacious, and very comfortable overall.  We were so fortunate to not have any rain during our visit, however, what a lovely place to be if it had.  The staff, from the welcoming, helpful doorman, concierge, bellman, all wait staff, bartenders, housekeeping were exceptional, friendly, and really made us feel like a ""home away from home"".  The only thing we didn't get to experience was the spa, which we will try to experience on our next trip -- and there will be a next trip.  The location was outstanding and very‚Ä¶"
August 2014,"Afternoon Tea at Brown's Hotel, London, UK","What I sent to Brown's Hotel (English Tea Room) as regards a family gathering on 13th September 2014.  ""Last Saturday afternoon was superb.  My thanks to you and your staff for such a lovely afternoon tea.  Faultless!"""
September 2014,Hard to add to previous superlative reviews,"Mayfair, with easy walks to Piccadilly and Regent streets, this is a hotel that also has it all, as you would expect from previous reviews. We had a three night stay in a junior suite that was large, well appointed, and beautiful.  Whenever we left, it was straightened up, so we always felt we received ""special treatment"".  I am sure that the other guests did as well. Breakfast, in their beautiful dining room was a pleasure each morning, and returning to the hotel after a hard day of sightseeing was a welcome treat.  The hotel lives up to its 5 star rating."
August 2014,Perfection In Mayfair,"We stayed 6 nights at Brown's and we cannot rave enough! The staff is there at your beck and call to serve. The hotel is outfitted to your every wish and comfort. The rooms are beautifully appointed and equipped with a bathroom that is simply wonderful from its size, fixtures and amenities. In the restaurant the staff makes you feel recognized and special. The concierge staff is THE BEST I have ever experienced. You cannot miss HIGH TEA at Brown's! It is an eye opening and wonderful experience A Definite DON'T MISS!!!! Location Is Also The Best!  Mayfair is wonderful by itself but is close to everything else you may want to see and experience in London. Brown's Is At The Top Of Our List!"
June 2014,Amazing Experience,"We stayed at The Brown's Hotel in London for 3 nights.  We were upgraded to a suite, which was magnificent.  The rooms were very spacious.  Customer service was outstanding.  The concierge was very helpful with everything we asked for.  They take the time and have the patience. The hotel is well located in the Mayfair Area.  It was close to buses, and tube.  We walked to Piccadilly, was to far at all.   The staff was great, everything I asked for was looked after, with as smile. We had breakfast included, which was amazing, they have great Latte's.  Would definitely recommend The Brown's Hotel.  Barbara Montreal , Quebec"
May 2014,Perfect Location,"Beautiful hotel in the heart of Mayfair.........Perfect location for great restaurants and for shopping in London......Warm, professional and friendly service....very comfortable rooms......enjoy a nice treatment in the spa! "
May 2014,The best afternoon tea in London,Have stayed here a few times. But not recently. We had our wedding reception here in 2009. And stayed for our anniversary in 2010.   On Saturday we took overseas visitors for high tea.   Excellent as always. The pink champagne special at ¬£220 for two is hardly in everyone's budget!  But. The quality and service and ambience are world class.   They will refill your cakes and scones till you beg for mercy.   I wouldn't go anywhere else for posh afternoon tea  
October 2013,Lovely old fashioned and homely tea,This was my third visit to Browns. As always the staff are lovely helpful and willing to chat but unobtrusive.  The sandwiches were delicious as ever. The scones with a lovely sheen and very tasty. The cakes were lovely - very homemade feel about them and absolutely gorgeous. Love this teA place and will go back. I love the seating so comfortable and homely.  Very relaxing.  Definitely recommend. 
May 2014,Quaint hotel and nice location,"This was our first stay at Brown's and we both enjoyed it. We booked through American Express which got us an upgrade to an Executive room and an ¬£85 food and beverage credit.  The room was well sized, on two levels and as with other older hotels in London it does have character (this is with regard to the floors which aren't all perfect!!)  Huge bathroom with a very powerful shower and deep bath. Good air conditioning in the room which helped as it was a hot weekend when we stayed. One minor point - we think the room would benefit from curtains with blackout backing as opposed to the roman blind which is currently there - this did leak through light into the room.  By using the ¬£85 credit we booked a champagne tea (for 2 of us). It was a nice tea but not as good, in our‚Ä¶"
May 2014,Disappointing guest rooms,"This review compares Brown's to the other ""five star"" hotels I've stayed at in London, including Claridges and The Savoy.  It does not compare.  The common areas are quite nice.  But the rooms are truly pedestrian.  I felt as if I were staying in a U.S. business-hotel chain.  At 300 pounds a night, I expected more."
June 2013,Like home - but better!,"This is an intimate, historic, beautiful hotel in an absolutely perfect location in London. My husband and I just returned and cannot wait to go back! The staff is welcoming, helpful, knowledgable and efficient. The bar and restaurant scene is fabulous, Donovan Bar is especially fun!  Our room was gorgeous, beautifully designed and well-appointed.  The vibe of this hotel is traditional, elegant and cozy. We would return in a heartbeat and hope to very soon."
March 2014,Charming Traditional-Style Hotel in Ideal Location,"When my mother tried to convince me she was born in London centuries ago, rather than chide her, I took her there.  Well, she didn't recognize anything there, but we did have an interesting stay at Brown's Hotel.  The staff gave us impeccable service (Afternoon Tea is not to be missed).  The room was less than modern and did not have air conditioning, but we adjusted quite well.  Next time, I would stay in a more 21st Century-type of hotel, but for nostalgia, this place is excellent.  Ideal location as well..."
April 2014,Nice hotel shame about the tea,"The hotel is located well, not far from Green Park and The Ritz. Staff were good and attentive. The doorman was particularly excellent. Rooms were well furnished with quality everything. The bed was so comfortable. The bar prices were very ""Mayfair"". Very. Where the hotel let my wife down was the total absence of in-room tea-making facilities, a usual feature of English hotels. She loves an early cup of tea, made to her exact liking. We supposed this was some strange hotel management belief making a perfect cup of tea was beneath their guests. Wrong Mr Manager."
May 2014,Wonderful Hotel in Mayfair,"Brown‚Äôs Hotel is very very good.  It is in a fantastic location in Mayfair, very close to Piccadilly, and surrounded by some excellent restaurants, shops and arcades. The service is excellent. We ate in HIX restaurant one night; the food, wine and service all very good. The room (we had an Executive King) was fairly plain, but quite spacious, comfortable and we enjoyed it. Bathroom was good but not luxurious. It is the oldest hotel in London and the owners have done a very good job in keeping it to a 5 star standard. The turndown service was excellent with little cards to tell us the weather for the next day and little samples of skin products: a nice touch compared to the usual chocolates. The doormen always ready with a warm welcome.  We felt quite at home at Browns; nothing‚Ä¶"
March 2014,Very British,"I booked the Browne¬¥s for my graduation from Business School in 2012 and stayed there for two nights. You quickly realize that the team is versed in their business. The service is experienced, when I asked for an iPod player, I got it - unfortunately, you have to ask. The building is old and a bit contorted, but in best shape. The interior is well designed, so you can feel comfortable. The hotel is ideally located in the heart of London. I experienced the high-end-restaurant in the ground floor, which offers a very English cuisine. At all, the Browne¬¥s is very British; distinguished, professional, elegant. If you like that - book it; I decided to try other hotels in London, to feel more home."
March 2014,Good location,Location is very good. Hotel rooms are very good. Breakfast was also good. The only thing we were disappointed was the staff working in afternoon tea room. There where lots of staf but nothing happend. We had to wait an hour to get our lunch. The bar was exelent. The bartenders were great! Real professonals!
February 2014,Good choice,"Very good location,good service,breakfast is great .I like generally Rocco Forte Hotels.This one has a boutique hotel character.It is expensive as every good hotel in London.Corridors are narrow and ceilings are very low.This ƒ±s ofcourse due to the character of the old building"
January 2014,Peonies better than at Chelsea Flower Show!,"We had another lovely night's stay at Browns Hotel this week - as always there was a warm welcome from the doorman through to all the rest of the staff.  The big WOW on arrival was the stunning, stunning huge arrangements of beautiful peonies - better than I saw at Chelsea earlier in the week.  This stay lived up to our very high expectations from past visits - we enjoyed drinks and delicious eats in the buzzing bar before going out and a wonderful breakfast the following morning with the full works including gluten free toast for me.  The beds seem larger and more comfortable every stay guaranteeing the best of night's sleep.  We will be back!!"
December 2013,Birthday Weekend Away,"I can not express how amazing Brown's hotel is, from the minute of checking inn, the staff had such a friendly and professional welcome for us,  i took my partner away for his birthday and upon entering our room we were pleasantly surprised with a beautiful chocolate birthday cake and bottle of bubbly chilled, the room was a perfect size and was just like being at home.  The concierge staff helped me with picking out nice restaurants and pubs in the area. The in room dining was so tasty and the staff very efficient.  All smiles from everyone and never did you feel out of place in any area of the hotel, Amazing location, great price and just a perfect weekend. Thank you for bringing back the friendly and caring hospitality to what it should be."
January 2014,"Great hotel , great room ..... Terrible noise intrusion","What a fantastic location , easy access to west end shopping and restaurants and a fantastic atmosphere within the hotel , BUT oh room 206 ..... Under no circumstances accept this room on a sat night as you will hear , cars screeching , police sirens , drunken folk from the Dover st wine bar into the wee hours .... Such terrible awful noise , no double glazing and endless all night long loud traffic noise and shouting ... You have been warned !   Otherwise great hotel , superb restaurant , buzzy bar .... as ever though almost impossible to make ones self understood by room service ... Breakfast arrived in duplicate but hey .... Was too tired after the worst night s sleep in a 5 star for many a year !"
January 2014,afternoon tea,"four of us went here for a 60th birthday celebration, it was casual dress but smart. The setting was exactly the same very casual with settees and big comfy arm chairs. There was a good variety of sandwiches that kept being replemished as soon as the plate was empty. Then came the mini scones warm with cream and jam yum yum, then victoria sponge of coffee cake, to be followed by more mini cake selections, Tea to drink until you could drink no more, by the time we left we where stuffed to the brim. Staff where good and there for every little whim you may have. We have visted the ritz but preferred the relaxed atmosphere at Browns. Just be wary their is a 20% service charge included in the bill."
January 2014,Another wonderful stay,"We are never disappointed by this hotel.  Fabulous rooms, happy and helpful staff and the most comfortable beds.  Everything is immaculate with great attention to detail, can't recommend this hotel enough."
January 2014,You can't knock it,"We stayed over Christmas at this, my mother-in-law's favourite London hotel. The service as always was excellent, our rooms, spacious, comfortable and bright. Afternoon tea in our room was a joy and dinner in the restaurant impeccable. You pay a lot of money to stay at Brown's, but you know you can expect excellent, professional standards in everything they offer - we are never disappointed when we choose this hotel. Stay here, you will not be disappointed."
December 2013,"Lovely, however","We stayed at Browns for the first time for my husband's birthday. The hotel is very start, the staff are extremely professional, as you would expect,  in particular John the doorman.  The evening ""turn- down"" service made us smile- slippers placed on a sheet, eye gel on the pillow etc. The bed was so comfortable but unfortunately we were kept awake from 5:30 as a result of a party in a nearby room. The night staff were aware of this because they delivered room service on several occasions but didn't appear to be concerned about the music & loud noise. The staff delivering the party food & drink spoke at normal volume even apologising to the party room because they'd had a delay in service! When we we t for breakfast the music was still on & I told reception at check-out. Johan‚Ä¶"
April 2014,Homely Luxury in English Tradition,"Good to finally check out London‚Äôs oldest 5-star hotel.  Behind old facades are modern rooms all luxuriously appointed, very spacious, and designed with attention to details. Above all the atmosphere is very homely, very English, with impeccable service. Rocco Forte is one of my most respected names in hotels and great that each hotel has its own individuality and character. I had stayed at Frankfurt and Florence years ago and when I checked in at Brown‚Äôs the reception had all my details including even my preferred newspaper.  The dining breakfast is very good with an extensive menu including an interesting Indian course.  A most pleasant stay right in city centre."
April 2014,really nice hortel in perfect location,"We have tried many hotels in London and we found the one suited to our tastes. We stayed for two nights in a standard room : very big for London, tastefully decorated with such a comfy large bed and a very nice big bathroom. Our room was also very quiet but with a view on the backyard (maybe not the best view but as a result, not a noise in the morning).  The breakfast was really good (try the hot chocolate and you wont have to have lunch afterwards!). The staff was charming and for us, had just the right attitude : smily, friendly and helpful. And of course, you cant beat the location : everything is in walking distance. We will go back."
April 2014,Still a first class Hotel Bar,"Donovan Bar is a bar that when we come to London, we always pop in for a couple of drinks. Great service in this long establish hotel. Maybe slightly pricier than other Park Lane Hotel bars. We always sit at the bar and chat to great bar staff."
March 2014,Wonderful Experience!,"Brown's is a boutique hotel with older architecture and more modern furnishings.  A really nice combination of the two!  The rooms are very large and nicely appointed.  Service was wonderful too.  The breakfast is servied in Hix Restaurant which is lovely.  The Bar is also spacious and modern if looking for an afternoon drink or cup of tea.  We did not go for High Tea although it seemed like it would have been a real experience!  The hotel is very well located near the Tube, high-end shopping and walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and many other sights.  We had a wonderful experience and wouldn't hesitate to go back!"
February 2014,Fabulous hotel,"Spent 3 days at this wonderful hotel, loved the place, the service, wonderful breakfast and absolutely amazingly comfy beds. Wee had a spacious room #317 ..Hotel  Location is perfect..you can walk to most places and we did. Would highly recommend this lovely hotel and will stay there again when we return to London."
March 2014,"Great location, service and quality","My husband really likes staying in Rocco Forte properties and Browns fully met his expectation of the brand's excellence. The gym is rather small but you have Green, St. James and Hyde parks a few blocks away so my gym needs were more than met.   The afternoon tea service in the hotel is a must try. Easier to get a slot for this if you're staying at the hotel.   The hotel, while not completely memorable, was comfortable with no negative experience. The staff was friendly and helpful. Would stay here again."
March 2014,Great for families with babies ,Stayed here for Mother's Day with my four month old son and husband. The room  was beautiful and had truly catered for my baby with changing mat and a whole host of other baby essentials! Staff at the hotel realised that it was my first Mother's Day and I was presented with flowers in my room ... Such a lovely gesture. Hotel itself is well located with bond street and regent street just a walk away. Staff are friendly and go above and beyond. Will definitely be visiting again for my London fix. 
February 2014,incredible,"We had a fantastic experience, first class in all aspects!!! Service was impeccable, beds were unbelievably comfortable Food / room service was great The bar has an incredible photo collection , and the cocktails are amazing"
March 2014,excellence,"we stayed 2 nights here recently and cannot fault this London landmark from arrival to departure we received first class service. the room service was exceptional with great variety and wonderful extra 'touches'  Overall we really cannot get over how good the staff are, a special trip made even more special by them."
March 2014,Stayed at weekend,"Watched BOD S last match and it was wonderful. The match and the hotel. Decided on a last minute night here, from the moment we arrived everything top notch. Interesting i saw a trip advisor review which said don't stay in 206 , so instead of internet booking call the hotel to arrange. Very nice  lady on reservations when I said not that room and she explained that she felt the comment unfair , they have since made changes but either way I ended up with a really nice room. Hotel is a bit stiff but really excellent location and service."
December 2013,The Donovan Bar - Expensive Disappointment!,"I met friends for a drink here last night and was looking forward to a fabulous Mojito. At ¬£15 a pop, you might expect a good cocktail but what I got was nothing short of a disaster! There are three things that I expect from a Mojito: Rum, mint and lime, but it was lacking in all regards. They couldn't be bothered to muddle the mint - leaving a small bushy sprig atop the tall glass, there was also some sort of carbonised lime slice with a cinnamon dusting as a garnish. Great venue, disappointing cocktails."
December 2013,Great location in Mayfair,"My husband and I have now stayed twice in this hotel for Christmas shopping in dec and again in February. The hotel is in a great location to walk to selfridges and also to fortnum & masons and of course right beside Bond Street.  The staff are very friendly and when we arrived back laden with shopping the doormen took our shopping and delivered it to our room. We have stayed previously at The Langam, The Sofitel St James, The Westbury and even Claridges and much prefer Brown's as it is smaller, less stuffy than Claridges and just seems to hit the mark."
October 2013,Stylish but expected more,"Stayed three night on a business trip, very stylish hotel, rooms are extremely big and convenient.  One major comment, too many steps between the elevator and the room, which make it really annoying if you're traveling light with trolley..."
December 2013,Second stay since January,"Impromptu weekend escape back to Browns. Thank you for accommodating us very last minute on Friday night! Lovley room, stunning bed! Service as always was perfect. Thank you too for storing our shopping in the fridge! Please pass our good wishes to Johnny, we were sorry to have missed him and wish him well got a speedy recovery. So if you are staying in London you would be silly not to book yourselves into this stylish classic and perfect hotel "
January 2013,Best Hotel in London,"For an authentic experience of the highest quality of British hospitality, service, accommodation and fine dining, nothing beats Browns Hotel. In the centre of the world's best shopping area, full of art galleries, and wonderful  Bond Street  shops, Browns is discreet and elegant. Afternoon tea- unlimited is London's best, while breakfasts are truly scrumptious, the salmon en croute on the trolley at lunch yesterday was sublime. Don't tell anyone,"
November 2013,afternoon tea at the Brown's,"Once again I choose the Brow's hotel for my Christmas afternoon tea with few friends, and as usual I call it top experience. This time I brough three new friends with me, and all of them they felt in love with the tea room. We loved the Christmas decoration, with the piano player, and of course the food and the service truly amazing. I am very glad when I discover a place which never disappoint me, especially when I bring new guests. Now even my friends say: afternoon tea in London, yes lets book at the Browns!!!"
October 2013,Amazing hotel and staff,"I was lucky enough to stay at the hotel for 2 nights recently. Was traveling with 2 friends, so we had a rollaway and they upgraded to a massive Jr suite for extra space. It was quite the treat. We arrived at the hotel around 10a and they told us our room would be ready in about 30 mins, however we were headed out for the day, so we didn't need early check in, but nice to know if we needed in the room it would be ready shortly. The hotel has so much amazing history and is so unique from building to building. Ask the staff, they are happy to indulge. Asked to see a few of the other room types since I will be returning again soon, and they had a few available to show - love how every room is so different. The views from all are very neat also. All of staff was amazing. We were‚Ä¶"
November 2013,best experience ever,"I was there last sunday with few friends of mine, their first day of the festive afternoon tea. nothing to compare with the other competitor in all Uk, and London. if you are someone just like me who does  not like to hear the word NO, when you spend a certain amount of money, this is the place where you need to go. Unlimited sandwiches, pastries, scones, cakes...but what gives a plus to this place is certenaly the service. truly attentive and friendly, and genuine, even the room was full, I felt like I was the most important customer. I would truly raccommand this place to all my friends."
October 2013,takes you back in time,"You may feel like you are paying for a Large luxury suite but dont get to excited to find that your room is nothing more than a nice average size bedroom full of old exquisite bedroom furniture, which is right up my alley. SUPER friendly and helpful staff, very nice and comfortable sleeping situation, always an answer to the best resturants and clubs and activities to do in and around London."
October 2013,"Nice, but perfection?","Staying in a very large suite recently showed again the mismatch of design and ergonomics as well as being userfriendly.  No sheers to block the view of the adjacent office workers, a desk that is not suitable for business (cluttered with menues, books and pictures), no international sockets...A masterswitch at the door and not next to the bed makes you hunt for light switches, a bath vanity that is full of products and trays but too small for own amenities - not thought through! The little gym is very nice, modern, light and well stocked with drinks and fruit, the Spa next door sadly does not have sauna or steam and seems to be an renovation-after thought. Full restaurants with very task-oriented staff, we did not get a pampered feeling during the meal, just very stern,‚Ä¶"
May 2013,sheer luxury,we went to browns as it was famous for its afternoon tea it was delicous we only stayed one night but all the staff where exceptional very well trained it was a great experience for my wife and i. the hotel is just the right size and in a perfect location also has a very good bar thanks to all the staff well done!!!!!!!!!!!!!
July 2013,Afternoon tea and Donovan's bar,"Had afternoon tea at Brown's hotel, lovely surroundings but uncomfortable, very low velour seating. We had a corner table, slight wait for service, but very friendly helpful staff. Extensive tea menu on offer. Finger sandwiches delicious and replenished. Warm scones, plain and fruit, plus fancies such as macaroons. Also offered specialists cake from trolley but we were so full we couldn't manage them. Pianist playing in the background which gave a nice ambience, not at all pretentious a very nice experience and a lovely birthday treat.  We also went to Donovan's bar and had cocktails to finish off our day out. Wonderful service, and lovely atmosphere. We had a great table and could see the mixologist do his thing. We thoroughly enjoyed it, we stayed for a couple of drinks, so‚Ä¶"
July 2013,Perfection,Only stayed for one night but difficult to find fault. The staff are clearly well trained to look after one 's every need. Very well furnished and comfortable room. Great bar quite lively later in the evening !
July 2013,Quintessential London,"Browns is famous for it's afternoon tea and is a perfect hotel in the middle of upscale shopping and walking distance to many of the tourist sites.  It's my ideal size, not too small but not one of those big chain hotels.  The service is special, the concierge staff wanting to take care of your every need.  When we got a smaller room with a view of a brick wall the hotel was quick to find us a more suitable one.  The bed was heaven, the marble bathrooms what you would expect from an upscale hotel.  London is pricey as is this hotel for Americans, but its worth it.  Plus you must have tea.  We had tea at 4 and didn't leave until 7:30, it ended up being our one meal of the day as the sandwiches and goodies are just divine."
December 2012,truly british,"I spent a week at Brown`s and I really felt home in London quintessentially British, cosy, friendly servisse and of course amazing afternoon tea! great location, off Bond Street, walking distance from Green Park, perfect for both work and shopping. dont miss the Dover Sole available on the room service menu!"
July 2013,Brown's Hotel...perfect Afternoon Tea and excellent service!!!,"We were 3 Young Italian Ladies and arrived at Brown's hotel at 5 p.m.after booked a table for the famous afternoon tea. A kind doorman showed us the Tea room and said us good afternonoon. The atmosphere and location ware perfect. The music with the piano was very nice and relaxing. Andrea the maitre, showed us our fantastic table at the corner.  The salt and sweet food were fresh and delicious, the flute of Ruinart was at the correct temperature, and only one word for the service: PERFECT!!!! Andrea and all his staff were were polite, smiling and willing to satisfy our demands. Have given explanation on all tea chosen, in a precise and competent. The colors, the atmosphere and decor of the room we were so relaxed that we left after 3 hours with one word ..... this afternoon tea‚Ä¶"
July 2013,Amazing afternoon tea,"We arrived at Brown's hotel at 4 p.m. and a lovely doorman showed us the Tea room. The atmosphere was perfect. The pianist was playing and a  very nice gentleman, Andrea, took us to the table  It was by the window in the some room of the pianist. The food delicious and the service perfect, all the waiters were polite with a warm smile. This was a very relaxed and calm place, and I strongly encourage anyone to try the afternoon tea at Brown's becouse is a unique experience."
July 2013,Good experience,"Took afternoon tea at Browns. Was a fantastic experience if a little expensive. On the plus side, a great ambiance, great fresh tasting sandwiches, cakes, scones, jam, cream etc. Which just keeps coming, as soon as a plate is cleared, another appears, a constant flow of yummy food on an all you can eat basis! Wonderful! Would I do it again? Yes! So typically English, wonderful selection of teas! A must try for everyone!"
July 2013,Felt at home as soon as we arrived.,"We stayed at the hotel, as a family whilst my husband was in London for business. We travelled a long distance to reach London, but felt at home as soon as we arrived. Great location. Fabulous helpful, attentive staff. Attention to detail from the door man remembering our names and welcoming us,  to recommendations for activities with our children.  Nice, comfortable rooms. Our children had their own beautiful room complete with personal bed linen, Wii and children's amenities. Our children were delighted with the treats and cookies delivered to the room.  Yes, this is an expensive hotel, but we felt it was money well spent. Can't wait to return."
June 2013,Old World Charm,"This was my last stop in the U.K. so meeting the very charming and friendly staff on arrival was a great start.  The decent room size and location were a plus.  The doorman with his carnation and top hat, the concierge with his hand written recommendations and a lavish old world breakfast buffet made this a great choice."
December 2012,A Dream Hotel,"The helpful staff, city location, English tea, and attention to detail made our visit remarkable.  Once the young man at the desk learned we were celebrating our anniversary, we were given a room upgrade and were treated with candles and rose petals on our bed.  The breakfasts and afternoon tea were amazing.  The Donovan was a special drink prepared for us in the bar.  This hotel should be on everyone's bucket list!"
September 2013,Afternoon Tea for the ladies in waiting,"Having Afternoon Tea (not High Tea, as we were told by our Tea Sommelier) at Brown's Hotel was a wonderful experience.  We were quite fortunate to be seated, as we did not have a reservation.  I highly recommend that you make a reservation in advance if you want to experience this.  We actually got very lucky after we pleaded with the hostess and also mentioned that it was our last day in London.  We had a short wait in their beautiful bar which is also another great experience to have at Browns.  Once seated, we had outstanding service and enjoyed the piano music, teas, finger sandwiches and desserts.  Since Wimbledon was going on, we were surprisingly thrilled to see a green tennis ball decorated pastry.   Being unsophisticated as we are, we didn't realize that they keep‚Ä¶"
September 2013,A wonderful afternoon,"What a treat! high tea at the Brown's Hotel, lovely atmosphere and the hotel is gorgeous. The gluten free menu is delicious and the tea selection was top notch. All of the staff are very warm and friendly, and we were able take our time and enjoy the experience. A perfect way to spend an afternoon in London."
September 2013,Afternoon Tea,"I had afternoon tea at Brown's on my recent trip to London. The tea selection was fantastic. There were many different kinds to choose from. You would be hard pressed to find at least one you didn't like. The food was fantastic; the desserts were Wimbledon themed which were incredibly cute. Service was attentive, incredibly polite, and friendly.   I can't wait ti come back for tea again on my next trip!"
July 2013,English style at it s best,"A Paul Smith decorated Christmas tree, a bar with atmosphere and a room to dance in. Superb, but not if you look for hip and trendy. This is a hotel where you feel very British! It is perfectly located in Mayfair, walking distance from what is the best"
August 2013,Understated luxury,"Friendly greeting, car whisked away without fuss, fast check in, quick coffee and off into London. The room was enormous. Enjoy having  the space in a bustling city. Location is great for fast access to many parts of the city whilst not being too busy."
December 2012,The Best Afternoon Tea In Town,When ever I go for afternoon tea at Brown's it is fabulous. The atmosphere is fantastic and the cakes and tea are second to none. I always leave feeling full and well relaxed.   Where ever else I go for afternoon tea this is the standard that I judge it by. I also love that you can have as much as you like.   A big thank you to you all at Brown's.
July 2013,Fabulous Brown's Hotel Afternoon High Tea Experience,"First time at Brown's Afternoon High Tea today. Did not disappoint. A few key things:  1. It's very relaxed but at the same time very high end and British.  2. Ask for Andrea (Male, Italian) who will walk you through the experience. He is the Assistant Manager and a very sweet guy. He will walk you through each tea he suggests for each course (sandwiches, scones, desserts and cake).  3. It's unlimited - you can ask for more of your favorite items (I wasnt able to finish everything I received on the first round) 4. You get a lot of food - so the value is great. Quality of food fabulous. The jam with the scones is homemade with huge strawberries. Delicious. 5. Lovely piano player plays while you eat. 6. So you get 3 tiers of delicious food. (8 1/2 Sandwiches, 4 Scones, 5 mini‚Ä¶"
December 2012,Browns once more is perfect,"I cannot fault this hotel at all! This time we were in a more modern spacious room, we were greated with respect in a professional manner. We had afternoon tea, which I rank top notch in London, we were even given our left over sandwiche's and scones on a silver tray in our room after becoming repleat. The toiletries are five star, in fact everything was. It is a lavish hotel, in lavish surround's and the staff are exactly how they ought to be at this level and all do their jobs very well. No complaint's and highly recommended."
August 2013,Great Location - Welcoming Staff,"I stayed at Brown's as a child 40 years ago and returning brings back wonderful memories although there have been a few changes.  The staff were so welcoming, particularly Johnny the doorman. Our room (Junior Suite) was spacious, comfortable and quiet. The light meals at Donovan's Bar were great. This was the second time we have stayed there over the past 3 years and we will most definitely be back!"
January 2013,Best Afternoon Tea,I think Brown's Hotel serves the best afternoon tea in the world.  There are other places that are more glitzy or elegant.  Brown's feels like you are in a Sherlock Holmes novel - cozy and warm.  I have been here for tea on three separate occasions with several years in between each visit and each time I feel like I've been welcomed home.
September 2013,English Tea,"We went for a high tea at Brown's Hotel in London and it was absolutely wonderful. We sat in plush comfortable club chairs, had impeccable service, fabulous tea, delicious tea sandwiches (salmon on brown bread, chicken salad, cucumber, etc.) beautiful cakes, and we lounged all afternoon. Very posh hotel in an old school way, it was definitely one of our favorite activities we did while in London. I highly recommend it. It was myself, my husband, my son (19) and daughter (14) and we had such wonderful conversation. Also surrounded by very very expensive shops which is fun for window shopping."
September 2013,Christmas at Browns,"Saved up to spend a 3 day break over Christmas somewhere special, after plenty of research we chose Browns hotel. It was dissappointing in several areas, for a 5* hotel staff looked scruffy & disinterested, no water when we got to our room, light fittings hanging from ceiling. Some good points - Location, Breakfast choice. I did get a positive response from the manager to listen to my views."
July 2013,Lovely Hotel,"Browns Hotel is situated in a perfect place. All the main attractions of London are in arms length. The styling of the hotel is very classy but has some traditional features at the same time. Staff are polite and helpful, when being served. All the dinner staff are trained to a high standard, this shows throughout your meal. Rooms at Browns are fairly expensive, for the prices they are you would expect things like WIFI to be free in the hotel. But, no. ¬£15.00 for 24 hours. This is absolutely ridiculous on top of the prices your paying for the room. You would of thought that the hotel would of made it free as they are already taking a large sum of money from you. It feels very rude of them to put prices on everything. "
October 2013,"A beautiful hotel, restored and modernized","The location of the Brown's is perfect for shopping and wandering.  The Bar was lively and served interesting cocktails.  The rooms have been redone and are sleek, modern but still classic with a comfortable feeling.  All of the staff were helpful and friendly.  There is an excellent Indian restaurant right across the street."
October 2013,The location of the hotel is superb.,"Great Hotel, Great Location, Great staff Staying at the Brown's Hotel was a wonderful experience, it has a great location and the food / service were superb. I would definitely choose to stay here again, I was on a walking stick at the time and the staff could not have been more helpful.  The location of the hotel is superb."
July 2013,AFTERNOON DE-LITE,"The elegance of afternoon tea at Brown's Hotel is a delightful experience.  Outstanding service without smothering the patron.  Delicious sandwiches and scones, wonderful clotted cream and jams and an ""all you care to eat"" replenishment guarantees a long and relaxing visit.  An intimate atmosphere of charm and grace with overstuffed chairs, fireplaces and piano music.  Not inexpensive but well worth the ""splurge""."
September 2013,afternoon tea,I didn't stay at the hotel but had the pleasure of enjoying afternoon tea in their salon. The service was very good and the food too. Totally worth it. And they refill your plates until you are done so you won't go hungry! I expected a bit more fuss but it was quite relaxed. Dress smart casual and it will be ok. Nice atmosphere.
August 2013,Wonderful experience,"Celebrated my big 3-0 birthday with an afternoon tea at Brown's.  The service was marvelous from the minute we walked in to the second we left. Stunning tea room,very quiet and peaceful,divine sandwiches and pastries ,lovely tea ,and fabulous Champagne. The hostess must have realised it was my birthday ,and surprised me with a divine truffle desert reading 'Happy Birthday' ,attentive and kind staff, superb service.  Highly recommended for both Londoners and visitors.  My new favourite place for an afternoon tea. "
September 2013,Hix Restaurant At Browns Mayfair,"Went to celebrate my granddads birthday,6.10.13  with the family had an amazing time, superb food excellent service. Antiono and his staff where great, My granddad left very happy like the rest of the family brilliant time will recommend to my friends had dinner at many other hotel restaurants but this was one of the best many thanks  K Taylor London"
June 2013,Perfect,"My husband, teenage daughter and I were fortunate enough to spend few days at Brown 's Hotel on London in July 2013. It was the quintessential London experience that I believe everyone hopes to have: excellent staff, very historic and elegant boutique hotel with the atmosphere of a private club, a beautiful room and fabulous dining with a very contemporary British focus (they even offer kedgeree on the menu), not to mention the perfect Mayfair location walking distance to so many tourist sights and fabulous shopping. The bar is atmospheric and fun, and the humorous but very professional doormen made it a point to memorise our names from the moment we checked in so 'Jonny' welcomed us back after each daily excursion by name as if we were returning to our private home. Every‚Ä¶"
June 2013,Top Notch Afternoon Tea,"Having had afternoon tea at Fortnum & Mason and not being impressed I was, after reading the reviews for Brown's ever hopeful, and I wasn't to be disappointed. From the minute we walked in to the trip to the powder room before leaving I could find no fault. I was in London with my sister for a special girls day out. We arrived a little early so had a cocktail in the bar, served with nibbles. We were informed by a member of staff from the tea room when our table was ready & no sooner had he moved away than the young lady who had served us our drinks was at our side with the bill. We were seated at a small round table, big enough for two in beautifully upholstered wing backed chairs, that were so comfortable I could have easily had a little nap after tea! The waiter came over to‚Ä¶"
June 2013,Good hotel Great size,"Browns hotel is a top of the line hotel located in a great area of London. Close to great pubs, restaurants and shopping. The staff was great and the rooms are huge compared to other hotels in Europe. They have good room service and a great little work out gym. The tv in the rooms is quite small but other than that. Browns is a great place to stay. The only drawback is that it is pricey. "
June 2013,Birthday Weekend,"We stayed at Brown's for my Birthday weekend & it was great from start to finish. The concierge are extremley courteous, as were the receptionists upon checking in. We were shown to our room, a very generous size with all the amenities you could wish for. The walk in wardrobe was just fantastic! The bed was very comfy and the bathroom was huge - toiletries replaced everyday and turn down service of an evening. My husband had ordered a birthday cake & a bottle of champagne for us, this was such a treat and the cake was delicious! We loved going down to the bar each evening before dinner- the atmosphere was very relaxed and it was very enjoyable to sit and have drinks and nibbles before dinner. All in all, an excellent weekend thanks to Brown's and we would definatley return!"
June 2013,Relaxing Afternoon Tea,"We had a wonderful time having afternoon tea at Brown's.  After being on the go sightseeing, it was nice to having a relaxing afternoon.  My niece and and I felt very refreshed afterwards. The service was outstanding!   We felt like Queens for the day. The food was delicious!  I would love to have some of their fresh, warm scones right now.  Afternoon Tea at Brown's was definitely a highlight of our trip.  I would highly recommend it.  The next time I am in London I will being going back."
June 2013,Delightful Afternoon Tea,"Booked a nice table for two for afternoon tea online and was given a nice table on arrival.  Had champagne with the goodies as well.  Great friendly knowledgeable staff, excellent service and delicious food which keeps on coming if you want it.  Superb atmosphere a touch of class in the middle of London. Thoroughly recommend it for a special treat."
May 2013,We only had a Great English Afternoon tea...,"The service was excellent every member of staff had a warm smile. The sandwiches were divine the salmon excellent and as we all agreed it was the temperature that the food was served at that enhanced the flavour. All too often sandwiches are chilled far too much. There was endless supply of anything that we required. My only slight negativity were the scones..a wee bit soft and spongy (as though had been warmed up in a microwave) . The jam was superb and tasted of strawberries and the clotted cream was heavenly.  However, on the whole the day was fabulous as we were celebrating our daughters birthday. The piano playing as an added highlight. After tea we moved to the Donavan bar and again the service was faultless. I cannot recommend Brown's more highly."
May 2013,Best English Tea,"A most delightful and delicious afternoon tea at this grand hotel.  The service was perfect, everything tasted yummy and looked beautiful.  A nice break from our hectic pace of touring England.  Highest recommendation."
June 2013,aftenoon tea- gluten free,"A wonderful traditional afternoon tea- great service (thank you Saliya) - nothing was too much trouble- high quality and delicate sandwiches, cakes and scones- frequently replenished and lots of tea.   One of our group needed a gluten free tea - this was exceptional and looked exactly like the standard tea- in fact, the rest of us were quite jealous of the cakes.  This was a very relaxed and calm place to meet up with old friends and catch up."
May 2013,Stylish oasis,"I took my wife for an overnighter without children - our first trip back to London after moving out of town. The arrival with lunch & drinks at Hix felt very appropriate indeed - stylish, civilized, calm. The next day we had breakfast at Hix, drinks in the Donovan bar and high tea in The English Tea Room - absolutely no complaints at any stage. Service was faultless and friendly. Our only complaints are that the decor in the room was was a bit out of shape here and there - everything is very high quality, but we had the feeling that some things had been done a bit quickly. The ventilation system was also very effective but also quite noisy. So, all in all, for the price we paid for the stay, we felt that the stay met our expectations (which it should!), but we did not have the‚Ä¶"
April 2013,Afternoon Tea in Browns Hotel,"My wife and I enjoyed Afternoon Tea at ""The English Tea Room"" in Browns Hotel, London.  It was the second time, after thirteen or fourteen years that we went there.  We originally thought that we may go to a new place for change.  We did not do so simply because our first excellent experience of so many years ago was like ""imprint"" in our mind.  Atmosphere was gentle and relaxing as before.  Service was excellent.  The quality of tea and food also was really good.  If we go to London again, we wish to go to Browns.  Only problem is that we are more than eleven hours flight away from London."
April 2013,comfortable luxury,"In London I normally stay at the Dorchester, Claridges, or the SoHo hotel.  Brown's is as nice as any top Mayfair hotel, but it's more relaxed and comfortable.  The service, cuisine, rooms, and flowers are all stunning and they all felt like they were there for me to enjoy.  I felt equally comfortable in the lobby in a suit as I did in jeans and this is why I might choose to stay here over the Dorchester.  If you want a haven that is there to support you rather than waiting to be impressed by you, this is a great choice."
April 2013,A perfect martini,"After a day out on Monday walking through Mayfair I decided to go to Brown's Hotel to The Donovan Bar for a drink as recommended to me from my close friend. When I arrived I was warmly greeted at the door of Brown's and pointed a way to the bar where I was welcomed likewise by a manager, I suppose. While sitting down at the bar, the bartender approached me with a smile on his face (I don't see this very often nowadays). I asked for a martini and had been recommended whole range of them whereupon I ordered one with this delicious apple gin. What a great choice! Throughout savoring the great drink and chit chatting with this Czech guy I enjoyed the atmosphere of the jazz-like bar decorated with black and white pictures on its walls.  Anyone who is seeking for a great experience‚Ä¶"
May 2012,"Fantastic, fantastic","Stayed for 2 nights. Was given a complimentary upgrade which was fantastic. From walking through the doors to being shown to our room, from the concierge addressing you by name to reception giving advice on places to go and things to do, from the hot chocolate being so amazing (must say best I have ever had and I know a thing or two about chocolates), turn down service, a little technical issue which was addressed immediately. Wish I could have tried out the restaurant but needless to say I enjoyed it so much I am back in June and will ensure I try out the restaurant. Compliments to the staff and management who continue to achieve excellence in 5 star service and quality. Fantastic "
October 2012,Let down by missing touches,"This hotel is lovely but not perfect by any means.   My daughter and I stayed 3 nights.   Our room was on the small side but very comfortable and clean.   Highlights - the central location, the ambiance, Afternoon tea, and breakfast in the restaurant.   Downsides - It took a little while for the staff to get to know us as we were out and about most of the time. When I tried booking for afternoon tea the receptionist repeatedly suggested I book it online... I had to gently point out that we were guests of the hotel! Secondly the room wasn't prepared for 2 female guests, the turndown service laid out one male and one female pair of slippers and placed a treat (night cream/face wash etc) on one pillow only. You'd have thought that after the first day they could've adjusted things‚Ä¶"
June 2012,If only every London hotel was like Brown's!,"A group of us meet monthly for dinner and drinks at different London 5-star hotels, and out of the 42 we have experienced so far, I would rate Brown's the best. I was a little apprehensive at approaching them initially, as it has the reputation of being a very select establishment. I need not have worried, as from the first phone call, every member of Brown's was friendly, helpful and efficient.Two of us had dinner there in early April and enjoyed the food and the pleasant atmosphere. Later in the month, a large group of us had dinner at Brown's, followed by drinks in the bar afterwards, and everyone agreed that it had been an excellent, convivial and trouble-free evening, one of my colleagues writing the next day that ""the food was politely served, timely and excellent"". Though‚Ä¶"
April 2013,Second Stay as good as the First,"Had a deluxe room overlooking Dover Street. The room is spacious and comfortable and the feel of the place is very luxurious.  Didnt eat in any of the hotel's restaurants, but a sandwich from room service was very good and service was prompt.  Staff very good and check in/out was a breeze.  Will stay again!"
April 2013,I love Browns,"I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over Europe and the states but I love Browns. Is is truly a class act. From the momenet you walk in they remember your name and do everything they can to help. I stayed with my wife for three nights and could not have had a better time. The location is great. The staff could not be more helpful. The room , because of the high ceiling seemed huge. All and all a great place to stay in London."
April 2013,Best hotel in London!!,"One of the finest hotel in London: amazing service ( I had some issues w/my credit card and they deal w/that in such a gracious and elegant way...!). Rooms are gorgeous ( second floor has huge high ceilings)... I'd stay on deluxe and up ( regular rooms are very nice, however if you wanna add more charme to your stay, deluxe and up make a great difference!). Breakfast is delicious, not to mention afternoon tea... A real treat! My husband and I we always go for Frieze: it's a very, very busy period for the hotel, but the service, the quality and the general appeal never goes down a bit! So... Chapeau! The spa is also very good: clean and efficient, the space is nice and Sarah gives wonderful massages! A little plus: as Italian I must say it was a pleasure to share the hotel‚Ä¶"
April 2013,Wonderful for afternoon tea,"With a small child, we often go for afternoon tea on special occasions rather than going out for dinner, as it means we can involve the whole family and not have to worry about baby sitting. Brown's is our preferred venue. The afternoon tea is just fantastic. An array of different teas to choose from (with non-tea drinkers also well catered for), lovely finger sandwiches (and they'll do plain cheese for fussy children!), delicious scones and beautiful little cakes. And they'll refill the plates until you tell them to stop. And then you'll swear that you'll never need to eat again. We're going again for my birthday this year - can't wait!"
May 2013,Afternoon Tea,"What an amazing place to come for afternoon tea. I came with some friends without a booking, trying our luck knowing it is one the busiest and most renown place in London to have high tea. They welcomed us warmly, sat us on a lovely table and gave us a thorough explanation of the menu. My friend is actually gluten free, and it was not a problem at all! Two well presented stands arrived within minutes. The food was amazing from sandwiches to pastries (same for the gluten free) and everything was unlimited! The service is impeccable, friendly and non intrusive. We couldn't expect better. A place where I will definitely return. Brown‚Äôs :  a must for any Londoner!"
May 2013,Brown's is Gold.,"Rocco Forte has got it right. This Mayfair hotel on Albemarle Street is beautiful. I have visited this place for pre dinner drinks and dinner many times and it always impresses.   Last night I met a friend who is over from the U.S on business and we had a fantastic experience in the bar, the service from the moment you step into the room is top notch. Nothing is too much of a problem and the staff are all running a tight ship.  The bar itself is elegant, wood panelling and superbly rich furnishings surround you, everything feels luxurious.   The drinks themselves were as you would expect, executed perfectly. Glasses of wine expertly chilled and poured and my amaretto sour was great. I love the fact that you get plied with enough interesting salty snacks to keep you going before‚Ä¶"
April 2013,Superlative,"My husband a surprise for our 25th Wedding Anniversary which included a night's stay at Brown's. It was perfect. Of course it's very luxurious but what is much harder to get right is the gentle, friendly manner of the staff. The word ""welcome"" just doesn't seem adequate as a word for the perfectly judged way in which staff look you in the eye and make you feel you really, really are welcome and cared aobut. And when we got back to our suite at night to find beautiful deep pink rose petals strewn everywhere....welll!"
August 2012,Excellent Afternoon tea,"I would highly recommend Brown's for afternoon tea and also for anyone needing a gluten free diet. We took our mum for her 80th birthday, she has Coeliac disease and finds it difficult to find many places that cater for a gluten free diet. Her sandwiches looked the same as ours and she even had little cakes, as a surprise for her birthday the staff brought out a little cake on a plate with happy 80th birthday written in chocolate on the plate. We all had a lovely afternoon with more sanwiches being brought out as soon as our plates emptied and tea being poured for us as we emptied our cups. There's a wide selection of tea available and juice if tea isn't your choice of drink, all in all I would recommend Brown's to anyone looking for a treat or special occasion. The staff were‚Ä¶"
May 2013,Afternoon Tea at Browns,"Had afternoon tea for my birthday last Sunday. It was a lovely experience. The sandwiches and cakes were plentiful, the ambience was perfect and the pianist excellent. Especially when he played happy Birthday for me. Even though it was busy, because it is two rooms it did not feel it and the service was excellent."
May 2013,Celebrate at Brown's!,"What a great experience seeing the celebration of 175 years at Brown's, the quintessential London hotel offering the charm of a period building with all the ""mod cons"" one expects of a first class hotel.  The staff were as charming and helpful as ever - a rare and valuable asset in today's world.   We had a most enjoyable stay and will no doubt be back soon!"
May 2013,Browns is where one ought to stay!,"It is a wonderful hotel, rich with history and character. The staff are very friendly and professional. The bedroom is small for the price but you basically pay for all of the services on offer and the name of where you are staying. The facilities are perfect, the restaurant is of the best standard and the decor is classy - all the way through the hotel. We only stayed one night, to test it out due to the cost, but my husband was smitten with this hotel, so we will return and look foward to it!"
May 2013,Perfect family short break,"Excellent service, very nice rooms, fantastic kids amenities in the room (baby products and equipment as well as lovely toys) and extremely friendly staff who made our stay truly special.   We had dinner at the Albemarle Restaurant each night with the kids. The food was delicious and again the service was very friendly especially with the children as well. The Donovan Bar offers a wonderful atmosphere and even better cocktails...really skilled bar staff, just tell them a little about what tastes you like and they make the perfect drink for you.  The Spa is excellent, too. My massage and luxury pedicure were heavenly and just what I needed at the end of a day with two small children."
May 2013,First Class hotel in a great location,"We stayed here for two nights this week (admittedly on a significantly discounted rate!) and came away very impressed with the whole experience. The location is very convenient for the West En, and easily accessed from Green Park tube station.  The building interior is wonderful, although we did not make use of most of the facilities due to other arrangements.  Our room was very comfortable with the only downside being the view - but what can you expect given the central location?  And the staff were very good and responsive. I hope we can afford to go back again and try out the restaurant, etc."
May 2013,Afternoon Tea,"Having visited Browns for Afternoon tea for a family member‚Äôs birthday I had to come on here to write a review.  I have visited several Hotels in London for afternoon tea and Browns is now by far my favorite. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive, the food, which included finger sandwiches, scones and cakes, was delicious and constantly replenished without us even having to ask.  There was even too much food for us all to eat. I suffer from a nut allergy and was provided with my own selection of food and the staff couldn‚Äôt have been more accommodating. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate in recommending Browns to others."
March 2013,Nice hotel staff shame about the room,"My wife and I stayed here on our first night of our honeymoon.  The staff from checking to concierge were great. Donovan's cocktail bar is a must, try the signature martini.  However the room a 'executive king size' was poor.  The room had no view, was next to an air conditioning duct and was so dimly lit you couldn't see in the clothes hanging area.  We paid ¬£475 for the night and we believe it is vastly overrated.  We have stayed in a number of good hotels in London, but would not recommend it purely because of the price to standard of room experienced. It's a shame because the staff are very good."
March 2013,Afternoon Tea,"A very relaxing couple of hours drinking as much tea as we wanted and eating as much as we wished of delicious finger sandwiches, melt in the mouth scones with jam and cream and a delectable assortment of cakes.  Our waiter Saliya  looked after us very well.   Afterwards, whilst admiring the floor tiles, we met Darren the hotel's engineer who took us through to show us the bar and told us very interesting facts about the hotel etc, he is obviously very passionate about his place of work and rounded our trip off nicely. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend to others."
March 2013,Felt like I was at home!,"When I arrived, I had a fantastic welcome by the friendly doormen.  The service in the tea room was excellent.  My room was great!  All the staff made me feel like I was at home.  Looking forward to my next stay."
March 2013,First Class,"We arrived exceptionally exhausted - and we were told our room was still occupied...but was offered an upgrade for a little more money..which was SO worth it.  Very large, quiet room, no view, but very comfortable bed and tremendous bathroom.  The staff warmed up to us after a few days.  Loved Mustafa, the evening concierge and Rita at the Front desk...both were exceptional! Lovely afternoon tea and great bar !!  Breakfast was sufficient..not as good as the other Rocco Forte Hotels.. (like Hotel de Rome in Berlin and Amigo in Brussels..those breakfast buffets are amazing).  Would definitely stay here again..You cannot beat the location !!!"
March 2013,Feels like home,"We visit London regularly, both for pleasure and business, and have been lucky enough to stay in a lot of London's top hotels. But Brown's is the one we will, from now on, always return to.  It is home away from home.    From the point of arrival my husband and I are greeted with such warmth and the service is always impeccable.  We are always very well looked after and nothing seems to be a problem in the slightest.  Each visit starts with a note from the manager which I think is such a nice touch.   We have eaten at Hix only once, for lunch, and it was excellent, both from a service and food point of view.  We arrived late, without a reservation, yet seated immediately without any fuss, or ""well let me see if we're still serving"".   We have experienced the Donovan Bar,‚Ä¶"
February 2013,"Excellent service, very friendly",Highly recommend this hotel. We went for the Easter holidays. The staff were excellent. Our daughter who is 6 got lots of special treats e.g. An Easter egg with her name on. We will definitely return! 
March 2013,Conducting business over tea at Brown's is relaxing and enjoyable,"Last week I went for tea at Brown's with a business associate.  This must the the 20th time in the last six months.  Always enjoyable, always relaxing, always quality.  What is it about Brown's that is so good?  Well, let's start with the service, the food, the atmosphere, the location, the general ambience.  Need more? The reaction of fiends when you say ""tea at Brown's"" is guaranteed to be positive and welcoming.  And when your guest starts in a good mood it is likely that your meeting will go well.    Pr√™t a manager it is not. Thankfully.  (I have not stayed at the hotel)"
March 2013,"""Afternoon Tea at Browns Hotel""","My daughter surprised me for my birthday with ""Afternoon Tea with a Twist"" at Brown's Hotel.... The twist being it was ""Tea Tox"".....a healthy version of afternoon tea. First off let me just explain, last year my daughter and i decided instead of presents we would take each other out for a ""birthday treat"", so last year i took her for afternoon tea at The Ritz... I must say my experience at Browns was so much better, maybe not as elegant as the Ritz but by far a much more relaxed atmosphere... Our waiter William was fantastic, explaining our menu to us, both food and teas....I chose the Blackcurrant & Hibiscus Fruit infusions which was lovely, my daughter had Lemon & something which she also enjoyed. William was very attentive, refilling our plates regularly.... The only‚Ä¶"
March 2013,Afternoon Tea,"I took my parents to afternoon tea at Brown's Hotel as a belated wedding anniversary present. I did a lot of research before deciding on Browns. We'd been to Claridge's and the Ritz previously but i had read such fantastic review about Browns, i booked us in there. We arrived early and asked the hotel staff if was ok to be seated in the bar(as we were very early for the time i had originally booked for) and we were shown through to a lovely bar. Once our table was ready, we were collected and then we were shown to our corner table. We selected the type of tea we wanted(we chose the traditional afternoon tea but the options included a lower calorie version and a champagne tea). We were then presented with the tea menu, two of us chose the Brown afternoon blend tea and 1 chose the‚Ä¶"
April 2012,Great experience,"We were fortunate enough to be treated to afternoon tea here and felt very out of place being four lads not dressed in suits. However our waiter was extremely professional and not in the least bit snobby, and although none of us had ever been for afternoon tea anywhere before he explained how it all worked. Having wandered down Oxford Street and enduring the usual hustle and bustle and constantly getting shoved around and dodging tourists, Brown's was such a nice escape from it and was a step into a calm tranquil environment where we felt pampered. The selection of teas is incredible, the sandwiches very tasty, the cakes very nice and the scones were just out of this world, especially with jam and clotted cream!! Remember this is four lads with big appetites and we were stuffed‚Ä¶"
August 2012,Great Concierge !,"I've rated Brown's a 5 instead of a 4 strictly because of the employees....My husband has stayed at Brown's several times and raved about about how charming it is. Since we were going to be there 8 nights , they offered us an upgraded room (at a price), which I understand from co-workers  this is general op procedure. Hubby said he'd been in much better rooms than the one we were offered. Is being on the street side worth 40pounds a night more? I really don't think so. I considered the room (#320)  shabby. The carpet was rolling and stretched in places and furnishings just weren't that nice. The King size bed is actually 2 twins pushed together which would of been ok - if a nice mattress pad had been used to smooth the area where the beds meet. However, the room was clean and‚Ä¶"
June 2012,Good afternoon tea at Brown's,"You certainly will not leave hungry, if you have afternoon tea here.  The hotel‚Äôs website gives a fairly accurate description of what to expect.  We had tea on 19th of March to celebrate a special birthday.  The English tea room was busy, but people‚Äôs arrival time was scattered. Although when you book ,you are told that you have the table for 90 minutes, no-one asked us to move after that time; the tables around us were also being very leisurely.  Service was good, but no mention of the price on the website indicated that 12.5% would be added to the cost  of afternoon tea in the form of a service charge.  There were only 2 of us in our party and there is not an option to serve yourself!  I think that the true cost should be published on the website.  I was also surprised and‚Ä¶"
August 2012,beautiful hotel in amazing location!,"I joined Leading Hotels of the World last year and have tried to stay exclusively in them in order to use the member benefits. Brown's was exceptional! Incredibly helpful and attentive staff, exquisite bed, spacious room, wonderful restaurant and bar and the location...wow! You couldn't ask for more. I will most certainly be back! Many thanks."
August 2012,Lovely hotel in a great location.,"This is a lovely hotel. It's quite quiet in comparison to some of the places we have stayed and I do feel that it is geared more towards maybe older couples. However I couldn't fault this hotel for what it was as the service, rooms, food were all excellent. The doorman was wonderful and very helpful.Browns is ideally located for shopping."
August 2012,"Great Location, Lovely staff .","Loved the hotel from the minute we arrived . The staff were professional but never haughty and even laughed at my partner's attempt at humour. The bar was superb and I would like to give a very special mention to the delightful young lady who served us on two occassions. (saturday 25 August) I have stayed at some very prestigous hotels and including a highly acclaimed Michelin 2 star outside Oxford and I can truthfully say that Brown's staff and service is second to none. Only one gripe. The cooked full English breakfast was only passable, our toast tasted as though it had been cooked several hours before and the coffee was weak and cold. I ordered smoked salmon and scrambled egg which was excellent however. Thank you for a wonderful stay."
August 2012,Best hotel in London,"Browns hotel has that wonderful mix of being an nternational hotel, yet feeling very intimate and boutique like.  The staff are always friendly and remeber you. The rooms are light, spacious and decorated in a very chic manner.  The location is ideal and perfect for the business or tourise traveller.  The bar is always buzzing and Hix downstairs is the perfect start to anyday.  Great gym and always a wonderful experience."
August 2012,Not what I hoped,"My husband and I stayed at Browns for one night ten days ago - the hotel is wonderfully well-located and the interiors are stunning.  Our room, if a bit small, was everything we needed except for the layer of dust on the TV cabinet and on the floor at the bottom of the bed!   Breakfast was delicious with a lovely menu that had everything from eggs to bubble and squeak and lovely fresh carrot juice, but again, the service let it all down - we only managed to get the waiter's attention for the bill by actually getting up and preparing to leave - and the breakfast room is not that big!     I am in London regularly for overnight stays and generally stay at the Stafford or Dukes which are equally well-situated.  While I appreciate that our overnight experience may not be a true‚Ä¶"
April 2012,A sure thing,"I love this hotel.  The staff is professional and accommodating.  The rooms are tasteful and it is in a perfect location- close to tourist attractions and great shopping.  It is a ""go to "" spot for tea and cocktails but it is not as pretencious as other places which makes it appealing."
July 2012,A London Experience,"Brown's Hotel is an elegant hide-away off the main street of Piccadilly. A short walk to Buckingham Palace, White Hall, and Oxford Circus, it is perfectly located for those who enjoy walking around the city. It is a block from the tube station, so access to other parts of London is very easy as well.  We found all the staff to be very helpful and professional. The hotel has a quiet luxury about it. There is a nice bar, and sitting area for their famous afternoon tea, just off the entrance. The breakfast is a lovely cold buffet, with the option of hot menu items.  Our room was not the largest, but it was fine.  There was a nice sitting area, work desk, very large bathroom, small but separate closet/dressing area, and came with the robes, slippers, and other amenities you'd expect‚Ä¶"
August 2012,"Nice old world charm, but...","Old world charm in the the heart of London, a very nice hotel and the staff are almost over attentive.  However, it was significantly over priced when considering the size of the room the lack of effective air con, no coffee facilities, and the high price of the extras, i.e. internet.  In summary, nice experience, but next time for the price I will be shopping around."
May 2012,fabulous !,"We had lunch at Browns today, what a treat. The food was fautless, and, as always, the staff were attentive and friendly. We always try and stop off here when we`re in town and there is never anything to complain about. If you`re looking for an oasis of calm and old-world charm, try Browns. It`s a bit early yet, but if you`re in town Christmas shopping, you will get the best hot chocolate in the world here. Enjoy."
December 2012,Not the real Brown's,"I've been stopping at Brown's since I was just a kid, perhaps a dozen times scattered throughout the 70's, 80's and 90's.  It was the quintessential English country house hotel--just faintly shabby, but immaculate and authentically itself. The hotel always said the same thing:  You're in England now.  Since the ""renovation"" I've haven't had the heart to stay more than one night--I'd planned to stay 5 nights, but couldn't stand seeing what they'd done to the old pile.  If you never stayed at Brown's before the ""renovation"" I'm sure you think it's lovely and very trendy British modern, but the experience pales to the feel of its previous glory.  Yeah, yeah, I know things change and Brown's is a business, not a museum--but still they didn't have to extinguish all the things that‚Ä¶"
November 2012,"""The Donovan Bar""","Visited The Donovan Bar as an after dinner spot and was very pleased. The Donovan Bar is the perfect example of what a truly great bar should be. All in all an amazing ambience, great atmosphere, cocktails prepered by knowledge bartenders and served by friendly and attentive staff.This makes an excellent venue to relax and unwind or to get ready to hit the town further. I will definetely be making a return visit in the near future."
November 2012,Browns Hotel London,A great hotel. A friendly environment with efficient and helpful staff. Lovely decorations with a 1st class experience. Amazing food in the main dining room and great snacks in the bar. A famous tearoom with gorgous afternoon tea. A great location with great staff. A must go to hotel!!
October 2012,Where to start! Fabulous!,"I booked this as a combined 85th birthday and Christmas treat for my mother.   The hotel is gorgeous in any case - with decor that is modern, restrained, and restful whilst still in keeping with the history of the building - but it was the staff made our visit extra special. From the moment we stepped out of the cab we were made to feel so welcome. Reception were friendly, helpful, and efficient - the concierge likewise. There was one member of staff at breakfast who was a bit grumpy - but he was still attentive.  The birthday cake and champagne on ice for my mother in our room on arrival was a delightful touch. The room, including the bathroom, was lovely - and although overlooking the street was completely quiet thanks to the triple glazing. I'm quite fussy about hotel rooms -‚Ä¶"
August 2012,Excellent in every respect,It's years since I visited Brown's last and I should not have left it so long. Faultless service in every respects. There is nothing more to add except I will not being leaving it so long until the next time.
June 2012,Lovely Lunch,"Had super lunch  ... we arrived very late at 3pm but the waiting staff were fantastic, soup and pork gorgeous, puddings a little lack lustre but perfectly fine. My Friends dishes were equally as good. If you want old world charm this is the place."
September 2012,Majestic in Mayfair,"Brown's may be my favorite hotel in the world.  It is charmingly relaxing with outstandingly friendly service delivered with such verve and style.  Afternoon Tea is a standout and one of the best in a city of superlatives.  My room was delightful, well appointed with soft as silk linens and pillows that made me want to forget my own (for domestic drivinn travel I usually take my own pillow).  Both breakfast (soft boiled egg done perfectly and toast soldiers) was the perfect start for a busy day and one lovely dinner rounded out my dining at Brown's.  All offerings were excellent and the deep fried asparagus stood out!  Brown's makes you feel comfortable, watches out for women travelers and is so very convenient to most London points.  I want to go back again and again!"
November 2012,Another fantastic experience,We were overwhelmed by the grandeur of the Kipling suite and could well see how Rudyard Kipling felt inspired to write The Jungle Book here. The perfect setting for intimate pre-dinner drinks with friends after a refreshing service of afternoon tea.  As always the facilities in the suite were of the highest standard and the bed was luxuriously comfortable. The staff in the hotel were friendly and helpful as ever without being obtrusive. Brown's has such a relaxed atmosphere throughout the hotel one feels instantly at home. An unforgettable experience and we will be sure to return.
November 2012,Amazing,"Absolutely loved it here, was made to feel so special, the room was amazing and was such a nice place to stay. Everyone was kind and helpful, the spa was also amazing. Would love to go back here soon!"
November 2012,Great Afternoon Tea,"I highly recommend getting afternoon tea at Brown's. The tea offerings were great and you get as many tea sandwiches, scones, and pastries as you can eat! The service was great and the food was delicious. I was highly impressed and would definitely recommend going here!"
November 2012,Respite in central London,"My wife and I stayed at Brown's for five nights in late September of this year.  It was our first time at Brown's having stayed at probably a dozen hotels across Mayfair/St James/Knightsbridge over the years.  I was a delightful stay and we will definitely return.  We had a bright, spacious room on a top level floor overlooking the rooftops along Dover Street.  At first we were concerned that it would be noisy with street noise, but it was quiet, both from external noise and from any of the neighboring rooms.  It was also nice to be able to open the windows during the day.  At night, I would have preferred more or brighter lighting in the room, but it was not a problem.    Our room had a large bathroom, but rather than a walk in shower, had a bath with the traditional British‚Ä¶"
November 2012,Superb,"Brown's Hotel is one of the best I've ever stayed in, beautiful room, excellent staff, very friendly atmosphere without feeling dowdy. Absolutely adored it, and if finances allow, would definitely return  Some very minor drawbacks were a lot if road noise (it is in the heart of London), and the room wasn't ready when we checked in - and when it was declared ready by the chamber staff, there was a lamp lacking a bulb requiring maintenance staff to come up. Minor stuff compared to the bottle of bubbly we got :)"
October 2012,EXCELLENT,"Me and my girlfreind stayed here for 2 nights over my birthday weekend and thought the hotel was fabulous. nicely appointed rooms and very clean throughout. We were upgraded i think because it was my birthday and the executive room we were given was great. Bathroom was spacious with a double sink, shower and large bath big enough for 2. The staff were very attentive throughout the hotel. Nothing was too much trouble for them and a late check out was easily obtained. You must try the Donovan Bar it has great cocktails with talented barmen that really take pride in what they do. Also a must is the afternoon tea WOW the best i have had in london and they just keep bringing sandwiches, cakes and tea as you finish a plate another appears, all included in the one price so make sure‚Ä¶"
September 2012,A real shame...,"We spent the weekend at Browns, really looking forward to it! The staff and hotel where as promised, from the door man to to maids. The room, 4th floor, 427 was lovely, however... We didnt sleep at all. Watch out, there is a noise all night from the light well, some sort of extractor, a constant buzzing machinery noise all night! And to top it off, when I reported this at check out, nothing! No apology or refund, A real shame as the rest of the hotel lived up to all we where expecting, so just make sure you keep away from the rooms facing the light well!! And enjoy the rest of the hotel."
October 2012,'Secret hotel' con but still an excellent hotel!,"Booked Brown's using lastminute's 'secret hotel' which indicated we were booking a ¬£600 per night room at a 50% discount.  The room we were allocated was a king size and we have not found any evidence on any booking site, or indeed Brown's own site, that such a room has a ¬£600 tariff.  So beware the stated discount!  This was very disappointing/annoying particularly as the room we were allocated (Room 219) shook due to apparently being above the hotel's air conditioning unit.  By shook, I mean like being on a cross channel ferry....  When we complained, however, we were delighted to be upgraded to an amazing suite which turned our first stay at Brown's into a fantastic experience.  The hotel is beautiful and the staff are, without fail, warm, friendly and helpful.  A particular‚Ä¶"
October 2012,Amazing Afternoon Tea,"5 of us recently went to Brown's for my Nan's birthday. Wow what a warm welcome to arrive too.... The service was platinum and the food was delicious and did not stop coming.... we certanly did not leave hungary. I told them in advance it was my Nan's birthday and they had arranged a small cake with candle which they bought out to Happy Birthday being played on the piano. Well, thank you Brown's for making my Nan's birthday extra special.  We all shall recommend you to friends and family."
September 2012,yet another splendid birhtday lunch at browns,visited the restaurant for my birthday lunch and we weren't disappointed.  We had a lovely spacious table for the 7 of us. The service was excellent and coudlnt be faulted.  The food was delicious and beautifully presented.  the final topping on the cake was beign sung happy birthday by the staff and being presneted with a lovely cake!
September 2012,A New Favorite - Highly Recommended,"We stayed at the Brown‚Äôs for two nights in September at the end of our vacation.  We had not stayed here before but will definitely be back!  We booked an Executive King room on an advance purchase rate.  Of the 6 hotels during our trip, Brown‚Äôs won as our favorite in several categories including:  best bed, best pillows, and best shower.  Our room was of good size with a walk in closet and nice sized bathroom (with separate tub and shower ‚Äì yay no shower curtain!).  It was tucked away in sort of a corner and though it had no view it was very quiet.  The hotel layout is kind of funky ‚Äì lots of little turns, hallways and stairs up and down.  I personally think these types of places have more character but make sure you remember how to get to your room.  My only minor complaint‚Ä¶"
October 2012,Tea with style with  mini scones !,"Brown's hotel is a great place to have tea, it has a club atmosphere. We always manage to get a table a short notice, specially if you choose to go at 6pm instead of the usual 5pm. It is also a nice place to come with a larger group, we were  eight. We were greeted by a very nice spanish maitre D who then took note of our choice of tea. Soon after,  our tea, lovely sandwiches, few small pastries, and mini scones !. What a shame !. Would it very difficult to serve scones warm and make them a bit larger than a small canap√© ?"
July 2012,Browns spa and Hix restaurant,"Fantastic manicure at Browns by Jana Watson and lovely room to do treatment in.  Concierge very good when you enter the hotel and hotel has a lovely cosy feel. Had a meal afterwards in Hix restaurant.  Lovely dinner, staff excellent and food very good."
September 2012,A weekend of fun!,"We recently stayed at Browns for a family weekend, it was our first stay here and we were keen to find out what it was like. We were not to be disappointed! As our taxi pulled up outside, the door was swiftly opened and we were greeted like long lost friends by the doorman, our luggage disappeared and was not to be seen again until it promptly appeared in our rooms! It is a beautiful hotel, classic finishes of the era the building was constructed are everywhere, however they have very cleverly incorporated all the modern needs of todays traveller, the rooms are superb, huge beds and headboards, and virtually every conceivable item you could possibly need is in the room! from mini bar, to ice cubes, to dressing gowns, slippers, bottles of mineral water, you would struggle to find‚Ä¶"
August 2012,Pricey average experience,"I have been in London many times. So here is the summary for this hotel: Pros:  -Location (near Picadilly, shoopping stores on Old bond/Counduit street) -Clean facilities -Gym facilities - spa - Good/personalized service  Cons: - Overpriced compared to other hotels in the same category. - concierge's suggestions were not what we were looking for  - Food at the restaurant was not very good"
September 2012,Consistently Good,"We are regular visitors to London and we always stay at Browns. The combination of modern rooms, excellent service - especially the concierge and bell staff - and a great location makes it tough to beat. The breakfasts are great and our only gripe is probably that the bar lacks a bit of soul and is always overcrowded. Otherwise however the hotel is great and we are always looked after superbly."
September 2012,Afternoon Tea,"Had a champagne afternoon tea here with a friend, Saturday 28th July 2012. We had a wonderful time. The food was superb and the staff were very friendly and courteous. They made us extremely welcome and comfortable even though we stayed for hours chatting. Would love to come again."
November 2011,A fine afternoon for high tea.,"My friend treated me to afternoon tea for my birthday. We arrived a little early, and had a drink in the Donovan bar, which was very nice. Excellent choice of drinks, that were reasonably priced.  Afternoon tea was excellent and they catered to our every need.   Due to myself being a veggie, and my friend being vegan. If you are a strict veggie, make it clear, as they were serving jelly. However the staff were excellent at getting me a replacement dish.  It was quite busy when we visited, but the staff were excellent and very accommodating.  The only down side that I could find, was that the carpet were afternoon tea was served, was very grubby and the seating, where we were sat, had a lot of food stains on it. I think we visited before a deep clean was going to be performed. I‚Ä¶"
September 2012,Old World Charm with New World amenities,"Oh Brown's....such a lovely stay here! Rooms are amazingly appointed and the turndown service is lovely. Everything has been thought of here. They have kept the old world charm but strategically arranged modern art and modern touches throughout.  My room was on the 5th floor and I found no trouble from street noise at all, even with the window open. However, there are rooms located that look into a courtyard so request one of those if you are worried about noise. It's central London and there are a number of bars/pubs around and it can get rowdy.  Breakfast at Hix is lovely. the buffet for continental is divine...lovely fresh fruit and eggs, all locally sourced.  Located just around the corner from Green Park which was great, easy connections for the Jubille or Piccadilly and‚Ä¶"
August 2012,afternoon tea and donovan bar,"I went on sunday the 16th of september with my family to discover the english culture in the tea room of the Brown's hotel. it was actually my first afternoon tea experience, not only in London but in general and as I am not a big tea drinker, I am trully imprest by the quality of the food, he tea and the service we had during this experience provided by Marie, Marta and an Italian woman than unfortunalty I do not remember her name. I can say than they made this experience exceptionnal.  After this amazing experience we moved to the Donovan bar, which is a bit more what I usually fancy. This Donovan bar is not just a piece of storie, The welcoming provided by Paula makes you feel straight away like at home, and the cocktails made by Martin and Matt were for me one of the finest‚Ä¶"
August 2012,another great stay in our favourite London hotel,"Saturday night we stayed at Browns again as we were in London for a big family party.  Each time we return we remember why - the usual great welcome from the doorman, wonderful attentive service throughout the stay and the fantastically comfortable bed for a welcome good night's sleep after partying late.   Breakfast - full English for me with wheat free bread (nothing ever too much trouble here) and scrambled egg with smoked salmon for my husband went down very well after a wonderful selection of fruits etc from the buffet table!  With endless cups of frothy cappucinos (they bring a clean cup with every top up) we were well set up for the day."
August 2012,a shocker,expensive and noisy.well located yes but that is about it.i complained but never heard anything in response.lots of noise from the street made it impossible to sleep.the feedback form was a thesis.i cannot believe anyone has time to fill it all in.a night i never wish to repeat.
May 2012,Attentive staff; well-appointed room; great location,"A weekend visit in the city brought us to Brown's and we were very pleased with what we found. From the greeting at the door through the check-in process and subsequently, the staff couldn't have been more accommodating.  Our room, an executive king, was spacious and beautifully furnished; the bath was elegant and well-stocked. The public spaces are congested--partly because of the configuration of the old but charming building and partly from activity.  Afternoon tea draws a lot of visitors and we chose to bypass the crowds.  The hotel is well-situated to shopping, theater, and dining.  We had some small quibbles like finding the ""courtyard"" filled with air conditioning equipment and that the hotel still charges for Internet access in the age of wi-fi, but we enjoyed our stay‚Ä¶"
April 2012,BEST AFTERNOON TEA!,"We booked this at short notice and were lucky enough to be offered a cancellation at 4.00pm - perfect!  Stepping into Browns is like going back in time - it is classic and yet sympathetically modern at the same time.  We were greeted by the doorman and then made our way into the Library where tea was being served.  We were shown to a taller table - I think they looked at my husband and realised that he would not be comfortable at a low table and were very quickly waited on.  The waiting staff are superb - you never have to ask for anything really they are just there - not enough sweetner - it appears without being asked for.  The sandwiches were replenished continuously, as were the scones and the patisseries.  I am not going to say how many plates of sandwiches we ate but they‚Ä¶"
April 2012,excellent location,"A very pleasant hotel in one of the best areas in London, close to Bond Street, Picadilly, Burlington Arcade, and the best luxury stores and tailors London has to offer. The rooms are OK in size and the design is modern but warm. However, the rooms are rather bland, without a luxury feel, neither chic nor very tasteful and miss any charm. The TV was tiny and the remote grubby. We had a room on the inside with a rather depressing view of a light shaft. The bathroom was adequate but missed a separate shower. Service is excellent, however, very friendly and efficient, really above par. Breakfast is also far above the usual even what is to be expected in 5star luxury hotels. The hotel is well-known for its high tea and with good reason, it is worth it. All in all a very good hotel,‚Ä¶"
April 2012,Old time style in modern times,"My daughters and I had a sublime afternoon tea as a birthday treat for me.  Nothing was to much trouble, the serving staff were masters of their craft and shimmered round the room unobtrusively ensuring that not one request went unactioned.  Now, the food. If there is afternoon tea in heaven it would be like this. Our parties differing requirements ( Gluten free, vegetarian and normal ) caused not a ripple of difficulty with a special mention going to Andras who ensured the food didn't run out. It's the only afternoon tea I've had that could compare to Claridges for the sheer joy of the experience."
April 2012,A memorable afternoon - High Tea,"Organised as a surprise for my recent birthday, I was treated to a fantastic high tea at Brown's Hotel.  The tea room, housed within the beautifully appointed Hotel was warm and welcoming, even though we showed up 30 minutes early.  The selection of teas was interesting and the food was fresh and plentiful.  Highly suggest indulging with a glass of Champagne (albeit expensive).  A memorable experience that can be enjoyed by all ages."
April 2012,Enjoying a bit of history at Brown's,"I moved here from a dismal closet of a room by Victoria Station and felt as though I'd gone to Heaven.  London is SO expensive, and staying here was certainly no bargain but the quality of the experience was very high.  The single room I had was most comfortable and although the window stared right at a wall, what can you expect in a row of townhouses?  I wasn't able to get a rate that included breakfast and chose not to spend the $30+ but instead nipped out and got a good take-out breakfast just down the street.   My one complaint here is that despite all the amenities, you are charged extra for using wireless internet, a set fee per each day of useage.  This is an anomaly to me and one I've run into at other 5 star hotels.  While you can stay at any number of cheaper hotels‚Ä¶"
April 2012,Fantastic Hotel,"The is the best hotel I have ever had the pleasure of staying at. The staff were so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble, and they upgraded us to a the Albermarle suite. The food was delicious - amazing smoked salmon. Perfect location. All round brilliant experience."
April 2012,Great Hotel,"Lately we have been travelling to London quite often and the highlight of our trips is the stay at the Brown's Hotel. It has the best location, and this helps, but what we love most is the staff. Everybody is extremely nice and helpful and every time the feeling is like coming back home. We also love the food, from the fantastic afternoon tea to a very good dinner, without forgetting the bar for a quick bite. Some rooms are on the small side, but we rather compromise some space for all the rest. We will definitely go back every time we are in London."
December 2011,The Best Hotel,"The Hotel did a marvelous job of making my eleven year old granddaughter feel like a princess. There were cookies and chocolate eggs with her name on it. There was a special tooth brush and tooth paste, and everyone was so helpful and kind. I have traveled many places in the world and I would say that this is the most outstanding hotel I have ever stayed in. The Browns in Number One in my book."
April 2012,Afternoon tea,"I had afternoon tea at Brown's with a friend of mine 2 weeks a go and i was very impressed by the service and the quality of food. It was worth every penny and i strongly recommend the place . Also had a drink in the bar and the atmosphere and service was outstanding , and the selection of nibbles was great . i will definitely return again"
April 2012,To the last detail,"When you go to a 5-star hotel that you've heard is fabulous, your expectations tend to be very high.  To the point that you may be overly sensitive to the slightest imperfections.  At Brown's, it's as though they have thought about every possible thing the traveler might experience, and figured out how to make it effortless and pleasing.  It's hard to say even what makes it so special.  It's in every little detail.  The way you're always greeted, the way you're casually walked through the little elements of your room that other hotels often leave you to figure out on your own (like how the hot water in the shower comes on by pressing the little red button), like supplying an electrical converter on the desk so you can quickly plug in your computer.  I absolutely loved my‚Ä¶"
March 2012,Posh as Posh can be! Great with Children too.,"OVERALL This is we hear the oldest hotel in London. And, as our friends from the UK said, this is a ""very posh hotel"". And we totally agree. We were treated with great respect and all of our needs were pre-taking care of.  GREAT WITH KIDS We were particularly impressed with how well they took care of the children guests -- giving them a unique experience with the hotel with: - cookies made with their name on them - special treats left for them every day - gave them books to read and play with - unique bed trimmings for the kids - fun bathroom items - shampoos and toothpastes for kids (see pics)  WHAT WAS EXCELLENT - the beds and bedding were exquisite, like a soft fluffy pillow to lay in - bathrooms were large and luxurious - the staff thought of everything, and did not seem to‚Ä¶"
March 2012,"Great area, nice place","I stayed here for 2 nights in December 2011.  The concierge is great, and the setting is excellent, this part of Mayfair is the place to stay.  The lounge is the place to meet people, great vibe.  Concierge is excellent.  Room had a view on a quite boring courtyard."
March 2012,A special occasion hotel,"Brown‚Äôs is an individual top-end boutique type hotel located on a peaceful street but just 3 or 4 minutes walk away from the hustle and bustle of Oxford Street. The staff are incredibly polite and attentive. The reception is small but with attentive staff who once the formalities of registration are taken care of show you to your room.  I've rarely stayed at a hotel where registration and check-out was so pleasant, quick and easy - and individual.   We stayed in a classic room (bottom end room) which was very comfortable and tastefully decorated and with some nice touches including some interesting art, books and more unusual magazines including Wallpaper (on interior design) and School House (a scary magazine for pushy parents looking at private schools in the UK). The bed was‚Ä¶"
March 2012,David B,"My wife and I stayed two nights. Everything about the hotel was first class, modern but with plenty of character and very well located for shops and theatres. We had a standard room but it was very comfortable. The staff were attentive and friendly. We had lunch twice in Hix and it was excellent. Our only slight problem was that the only place in the afternoon to get a cup of tea, (rather than the formal afternoon tea) seemed to be the bar, which is fine in the evening but has no windows and is rather dark in the afternoon."
November 2011,Luxury,"A fantastic hotel where nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff. An atmospheric, historic hotel with a lively bar."
March 2012,Simply Perfection,"I visited Browns on Friday for Afternoon Tea  as a treat for my birthday, and what a treat it was! I have to say the service, attention to detail and food was beyond what I expected. The property itself is a beautiful building and in a great location, the street is quiet but only a short walk from the hussle and bussle of Piccadilly, Mayfair or Oxford Street.  The warm greeting and atomosphere is followed up with exceptional service. Our waitress was personal and attentive without being intrusive. The beauty and elegance of the room is filled with delightful music from the pianist and sets perfectly the scene for a traditional afternoon tea.   We enjoyed a wide variety of fresh sandwiches which were refilled when we had finished them, along with hot scones, desserts and even a‚Ä¶"
November 2011,Sad to leave this piece of heaven,Stayed for my boyfriends 40th birthday. Everything about this property surpassed our expectations.

March 2012,Best service I have ever experienced,"My wife and I have been regular visitors to the Donovan bar and Hix restaurant over the years - our London favourite - but had never stayed in the hotel until now. We were celebrating my wife's 50th birthday, from start to finish the service and attention to detail from all of the staff was simply outstanding, my wife was overwhelmed. Exceeded our expectations in every respect. Wonderful, we wouldn't consider staying anywhere else in London from now on."
March 2012,"Good enough for Lrd Byron, well then its good enough for me - I always say",Located in central london in the heart of the City. This is a uique hotel experience.. My favorite is the Lord Byron room. If you ever need to relax and be pampered for a fortnight or twom then Browns is indeed the place for you. Male sure to have high tea in the lobby. Its a hoot.
January 2012,"Elegant, great service, great location","Right in the heart of great shops and an easy walk to museums, the theatre and wonderful restaurants.  Lovely, comfortable room and the staff is very friendly and accommodating."
January 2012,My fav hotel,"My favourite hotel, it is perfect in everything, from locatiion to decoration, how much I miss to be there... but I am coming back with some of my girlfriends in May, so I am just counting the days for my champagne cocktail at the Donovan!"
January 2012,Outstanding. Simply the best London hotel we have ever stayed at.,"A classically beautiful hotel in the very heart of London. No grand intimidating entrance just a beautiful front door and a smiling doorman to greet you! Impeccable service, attention to detail and warm friendly staff.  We stayed for our 15 yr anniversary - what a treat! We stayed in  the impressive Dover Suite and were greeted by champagne and a gorgeous anniversary cake.  What followed was even more special - see photo - but don't look if u want a surprise!!! Fantastic spa too. Truly our best anniversary hotel stay yet. "
January 2012,Unique charming 5 star property,"I stayed at Brown's for a 2 day conference in March 2012 and was extremely impressed by the attentive but unobtrusive service, professionally run conference facilities and the uniqueness of the property which is 11 Georgian townhouses combined into one hotel. My room was very comfortable with a lot of period features with very tasteful contemporary feel. Would highly recommend Donovan's Bar which great cocktails and some really interesting photographs on the wall. "
January 2012,Brilliant,A luxurious home from home in Mayfair. A really comfortable hotel that feels intimate. Staff are wonderful. The restaurant; HIX by Mark Hix is outstanding. Buzzy bar. Brilliant afternoon teas.
December 2011,'Brilliant' experience,"On an overnight business trip to London and couldn't have made a better choice of where to stay. The room exceeded my expectations and in a nutshell, my entire experience was simply 'Brilliant' and would highly recommend to any 'trip' reader."
December 2011,Absolutely Superb!,"I stayed at Browns on Sunday 8th January. We had a junior suite on the 4th floor and I could not find one fault in the Hotel or service. Even the doormen and concierge were extremely polite and helpful! Our room was spacious with fresh fruit and everything in the mini bar you could possibly need! In the morning as we were catching an early train to Paris we ordered breakfast in our room and again the cooked breakfast was superb along with the service which was prompt. If you are after immaculate service, friendly atmosphere and great quality, you will not be disappointed in Browns!"
December 2011,Donovan Bar - real buzz,"Pre dinner drinks in Donovan Bar - fascinating mix of people. Lively. Cocktail waitresses very attentive, patient and friendly. Lively. Expensive."
November 2011,The Public has priority over hotel guests !,"I trawled through London's new and renovated hotel offerings on the internet and was very tempted by several of them, but having stayed at this hotel previously, I took the easy option and decided to return to it. As previously, I went down to the Tea Room  to have a cup of afternoon tea and read my book.  Unlike previous visits, I was refused and told that I could only go into the dimly lit bar !  The Tea Room was being kept for what appeared to be non hotel guests of principally Asian origin to take full afternoon tea !! Apparently, to be an hotel guest affords one no rights to reasonable use of the facilities ! Next time I trawl the internet offerings, I shall chose more wisely !"
September 2011,"Beautiful hotel, very attentive service","We stayed at Brown's for a 10 day stay over Christmas. Everything was perfect, the hotel is beautiful, nicely renovated and they gave us a big room as we were staying for such a long time. The service was really outstanding, everything was done very quickly. Whenever I called with an extra request, they were at the door 10 minutes later, delivering what we'd asked for. I complained once and they went out of their way to apologize and make things better. My go to hotel in London from now on!"
August 2011,Wonderful family experience,"We stayed at this amazing property right in the elegant Mayfair with all the family. My husband and I and my two boys of 7and 4 years. When we checked in in our wonderful and very spacious suite, Rooms 101 we found the most incredible welcome amenities such us champagne for us and all the most special pastries and toys for the kids. The staff was very friendly and professional and most of them are italian and for us it was perfect. We highly raccomend this property!"
August 2011,Fabulously opulent surroundings at bargain basement prices!,If you are looking for truly superb food in truly superb surroundings - and you are in London - visit Brown's in Mayfair. It's a real special place to take a loved one or to show off to business colleagues - but the great thing is the prices are really really good and the food - world class.You can usually get in at lunchtimewithout a reservation - but best to make one if you can. A great place.
August 2011,Outstanding!,"A fabulous example of how it should be done.  Seamless excellence in all aspects. Beginning with the doorman who opened our taxi's door to the genuinely fond farewell.An amazing start to a celebration week-end.  Brown's has it in spades.  Wonderfully comfy beds and the tv in the bathroom a real wow with our teenage daughter!  The staff were all welcoming, polite and helpful."
June 2011,Just Perfect!,"I recently travelled to London with my newly fianc√© to celebrate our engagement. We chose Brown's Hotel as we heard it is one of the oldest hotel in London, because the location is great and because we are affectionate to Rocco Forte hotels. Our stay was just perfect, like a dream.. We informed the hotel that we were there to celebrate our engagement and they did their very best to make our stay memorable, starting from a warm welcome from the GM at check in to a room upgrade, a bottle of champagne in the room awaiting us with some fresh fruit and a lovely card. And it wasn't over.. at our return to the room in the evening we found rose petals and candles around bed, sofa and bathtub, it was so romantic. Next day we decided to make the most of our beautiful room and have‚Ä¶"

The service was excellent as was everything about this hotel.The location is just right,near everything..the theatres, Oxfordstreet..The atmosphere was so amazing,from years gone bye..and yet with all the modern facilities.."
July 2011,Nice but Way Overpriced,"Checked in on 8/17 and was taken to a room smaller than my closet at home and overlooking an interior lightwell.  For over $800 per night, not the kind of accommodations one would expect, but since we were tired from a 12 hour flight from Los Angeles we waited until the next day to complain.  We were shown two different rooms - both very nice, but one which cost an addition $120/night, the other $250/night additional.  We took the lower priced upgrade which was very nice and reasonably spacious - by London standards - and had three windows overlooking the street.  Because I had stayed here many times years ago, before the Forte group took it over, I was disappointed by the excessive charges.  That being said, the included breakfast was very good as was dinner in the restaurant. ‚Ä¶"
July 2011,We loved it and we'll be b a ck,"I had the most pleasant stay at Brown's Hotel in Mayfair, London, England recently.  It was the most comfortable sleeping in years with gorgeous soft, fluffy pillows.  It has the dignity and reserve of days gone by.  The staff were were courteous and and friendly.  Brown's is a  small hotel without the noise and bustle of the larger hotels.  So if you are looking for a quiet hideaway yet close enough to other swinging emporiums for an exciting night out., this is the place."
April 2011,Personalized very professional service,"The staff was responsive and handled any issues with grace and poise. The hotel is perfect for its location, great  restaurant and tea room. We had a lovely bedroom, Very comfortable bed. Concierge services were great.  Highly recommend and the area is superb and shopping outstanding. Great experience and would rebook again. Personalized very professional service."
July 2011,50th Anniversary High Tea,"We were in London for our 50th Anniversary.  Our son was with us & suggested ""High Tea"" at Brown's.      We came. We saw. We ate. We enjoyed. They conquered.  It's a ""Once-in -a-Lifetime"" experience that I'd like to repeat!!   And right across the street from Tiffany's!!       ""Tea at Brown's/Tiffany's"".  That sounds like a great movie title.      We arrived about 5:00 p.m. Had reservations & were seated immediately -- at a table by the window. At my request, the pianist played ""Moonglow"" to surprise my wife!  It worked. She almost cried as she said ""Thank You."" Pianist had an excellent repertoire.     From there we went to the theater & saw ""Billy Elliott.""  A great day."
May 2010,They spoiled us,"We stayed at Brown's four nights with our daughter age 10.Large room 40 sq.m in the fifth floor.King size bed for us, extra bed for my daughter. Room made and cleaned twice a day. New quilt cover for our beds every day, my daughter's with childish decorating. Home made cookies by her bedside with her name written upon them.Small things that make a big hotel. Superb location didn't need taxi for our walks to the center. Breakfast from a rich buffet,     excellent  dinner with junior menu, we liked it wasn't so formal, waiters calling you by your name. Everybody friendly and willing to help. As a result they spoiled us."
September 2009,Afternoon tea - what a fantastic experience,"Arrived at Browns Hotel yesterday for afternoon tea to celebrate my daughter's birthday. What a wonderful experience! Staff very attentive, truly impressive tearoom, and the tea itself was beautifully presented. The pianist played ""happy birthday"" tune and a member of staff presented my daughter with a tiny cake, topped with a lit candle! Thank you very much Brown's Hotel, for making this a very special day for myself and daughter."
May 2010,great hotel,"We love this hotel, especially the afternoon tea.  In the tea room the helpful chinese girl with the pretty smile has left  - thats a shame, but the rest of the staff are still great!"
May 2010,Very nice hotel in convenient location,"The Brown's Hotel London is truly a nice experience. The hotel provides very nice rooms, good service, excellent breakfast, a nice bar and famous afternoon tea. We have been very lucky and received a complimentary upgrade to one of the larger accommodations. The design of the hotel is nice mixture of modernity, coziness and elegance. We have booked afternoon tea on one of the days of our stay. Surprising and disappointing: their herbal infusion was not available on that day, even though we had pre-booked the Tea Tox. Also the service during afternoon tea could have been a little bit more friendly-warm as it was a bit too professional, blas√©. Overall still a nice experience."
May 2010,Simply the Best Hotel in London,I sent a loong weekend in London and Just could not get the level of service this hotel has to offer. The Front Office Staff are amazing and could not do enough for us from the moment we arrived.  The Beds are so comfortable I had the best nights sleep in a hotel ever.   If you go there have Afternoon Tea the whole experience is just out of this world.  And the Location is perfect
March 2010,Not Impressed,"This is meant to be one of london's finest hotel and when it comes to afternoon tea it truly is. However the room we stayed in had a ridge down the center of the bed, as it was two twins patched together, not a real king. The lounge chair had a rather large stain on it, which initially didn't bother me. One of the light switch's had cracked faceplate. There was no outlet for the hair dryer anywhere near the mirror. Antiquated in room entertainment system, not a concern for me but some people might be bothered by this. The finish in the bathroom was just not at the level one would expect of a hotel with rooms starting at nearly $700 dollars a night. Further to this I did fill in the customer survey upon leaving with all these issues listed out and didn't hear back. I'll stick to‚Ä¶"
February 2010,Elegant and very well located.,"You may say that this is a luxury hotel. Yes, you are right and it is not cheap. So ? If you decided to stay at the Brown's you won't be disappointed.  The welcome already at the front door clearly sets the picture. You are a a guest of the Brown's and treated as such. After a quick check-in, my wife and I went straight to our room. And what a room ! Excellent choice in terms of furniture and decoration. The bathroom ? (yes we are quite demanding for this space even if you only spend a minimum time in it). One of the best bathrooms with the one of a resort in Grenada (Spice Island Beach Resort - see review). Large and with daylight (not always the case). In the shower you could shower in one go your quintiplets easely just to say that it is roomy. Again, it was a well provided‚Ä¶"
January 2010,World Class operation,"We stayed on the 9th May for our Wedding Anniversary. The suite was fabulous, service throughout was outstanding. Attention to detail was exemplary. We didn't have dinner,  but having experienced an excellent breakfast, next time we will."
January 2010,Mediocre afternoon tea,"I had afternoon tea at Brown's and found it to be a mediocre experience.   The room where the tea was served was small and cramped. It also felt well travelled, as if it were a rat run for large numbers of staff.  The strawberry jam was good as were some of the sandwiches. However, the rest of the food was average. The victoria sponge cake was dense and tasteless, The sweets were unpleasant and tasted like they had been sitting around a while.   There was live piano music but the piano was too large for the room. I couldn't hear the conversation at the table very well when the piano was being played.  Not worth the ¬£40+ per head. You'd get better results if you went home, made a Victoria sponge cake yourself, and brewed some tea you bought from the grocery store."
January 2010,Bad experience,Stay at Browns was disappointing.  jewelry in an inner pocket of a handbag and was stolen out of my room and the cleaning staff helped themselves to chocolates I had bought the previous night. Service is stuffy and in some cases downright rude.  There is only one small downstairs lounge you can use as a hotel client.  The staff have the audacity to kick you out of the lounge as they book tea for outside clients in the afternoon and you are forced into a dingy bar in the back of the hotel.  Service is strange and in my experience dodgy.  Got woken up in the middle of the night by a staff member claiming to wan to do a turn down service. Rooms are very small and decor is basic. Hotel management was mildly apologetic but basically said there is nothing they can do about the thefts‚Ä¶
May 2009,"Location, Location, Location with an iconic hotel run by the Maestro Rocca","Located on one of London's swankiest streets right at the heart of Mayfair, this iconic hotel welcomes you like family from the moment you step from your car. A celebrity doorman, a smiling receptionist and in 10 minutes we were totally relaxed in one of their opulent oversized rooms overlooking Dover Street and sipping on delicious afternoon tea (A Browns must have !) The hushed grays and browns of the decor recently done by Rocco's sister fit seamlessly with the original art and furniture pieces. The bed is just huge and as comfortable as anyone could wish for. The 'Pillow Menu' promises whatever type of pillow you desire. The bathroom in cream marble is a sight to behold. After freshening up we wandered down to the infamous Donovan's bar for a couple of their signature‚Ä¶"
February 2009,Old Style Elegance,"Brown's is a beautiful old-London style hotel. The Mayfair location can't be beaten, the rooms are luxurious though vary widely in size (all have the same amenities) and the staff are extremely attentive. Most rooms have sofas/sitting areas, spa-style bathrooms and great finishing touches. It's an expensive hotel but worth it's cost and a great location for a business traveller. Tea or drinks in the bar is a definite must if time permits."
August 2009,"Very Nice Experience, not great for business travelers","We spent three nights at Brown's during a business trip and found it to be a great experience.  Having had tea at Brown's many times in the past and loved it, we enjoyed experiencing other dimensions of the hotel's services.    As with many hotels, the doorman is great and quickly begins to recognize guests.  The front desk is located outside of view from the front (very little in the way of a public lobby which isn't a bad thing in our opinion) though the concierge is right at the front door and was also very helpful in securing reservations, Van Gogh tickets, etc...  Our room was on a high floor but very small...rooms at Brown's have always had that reputation and when traveling for business it's nice to have space to spread things out.  Further, they do not have WiFi so if‚Ä¶"
July 2009,Good Hotel,"Stayed here with my husband for the weekend to do some shopping (we expected good things of this hotel because we stay at the Tresanton, which is another hotel within the group.  Didn't   do much shopping because we ended up spending most of our time in the bar drinking  champagne!!!  This is a lovely hotel, very buzzy and very friendly with charming and very competent staff.  Only down side was that the room we were given (¬£300 per night) was too hot and we could not open the window because the smell of the food in the kitchen was overwhelming.  Other than that, a well earned pat on the back  Olga - another triumph."
May 2009,understated elegance,Arrived at 8.30pm after checking out of another hotel that was awful! The staff are very pleasant and accommodating. Food lovely and lots of variety. Rooms spacious and modern  with big bathrooms and lots of areas for clothes and work areas. Stayed with my 12 year old daughter who loved the ambience of the hotel. I would wholly recommend this hotel for a convenient location and classy english atmosphere.
April 2009,Afternoon Tea,"We booked afternoon tea at Brown's after my daughter's graduation. It was really first class, we had a great table in the window and they were ready for us. I had pre-advised them that two of our party were gluten free and they had gone to a lot of trouble to ensure that they missed out on nothing! There were separate plates of gluten free versions of everything that everyone else had and they were as delicious as the ordinary fare. The service was charming and unobtrusive and the whole experience memorable and special and worth every penny. No wonder Brown's came top in a poll of 'best afternoon tea' - I think this was in TimeOut and was well deserved. We would always think of Brown's in the future for a special occasion tea."
April 2009,loved it,Stayed here whilst attending a conference at another hotel. It was amazing! Staff were very slick and it felt like they knew what you were thinking before you did! Had a lovely room and great service from the bar staff when we came back late at night. Will definitely come back for a treat!
April 2009,There are better options,"There is nothing technically wrong with Brown's Hotel, but there are plenty of hotels in the same (high) price category which are far, far superior (One Aldwych! Claridge's! Connaught!). The room I was first taken to was awful. It was terribly claustrophobic with empty walls, everything grey and beige and with a brick wall right outside my window! I asked for a different room and was given a better one. But it was truly nothing special. I also asked to see rooms in higher categories and suites and decided that I will not return to this hotel. The elegance at Brown's is very understated, the entrance and the lobby are very small, the restaurant decor borders on the boring and you are charged for every little thing (I asked for some cutlery to be brought to my room and was charged‚Ä¶"
March 2009,5-Star DELUXE...,"When you walk through the doors of Brown's, you know you've arrived at somewhere very special.   From the discreet, but hugely helpful staff, to the elegant decor. This place is a gem. We stayed in a junior suite which, although it didn't have a fantastic view, still ticked all the boxes. Huge bathroom - with ALL the extras including aromatherapy oils and very good quality soaps, oh-so-fluffy robes and posh slippers (not the usual Hilton & Co rubbish). Fantastically comfortable bed and just about everything you could wish for.  Some nice touches included an iPod dock, decent TV and good AC.  Nice breakfast and top service.  Would love to go back soon!"
December 2008,Very impressed,"My wife and I stayed at Browns, 1st to 3rd May, 09. Good, decent sized, comfortable rooms. All the staff were very well trained, helpful and friendly. All service was first class. We decided to stay in one evening and ate in the main restaurant. Food and service was of a high standard and we were very impressed with that as many hotel restaurants disappoint. Not cheap at around 300GBP/night inc b'fast but all things considered not bad value. We have both stayed in other 5* hotels in London but Browns is by far the best."
February 2009,Home away from home,"I have stayed many times at the Browns.  The staff is amazing, food excellent, and the rooms are perfect.  Seriously, there is only one thing that the Brown needs to work on and thats breakfast!!  Buffet is ok, but needs some work.  The hotel is not cheap and thats good, cause I want them to maintain the type of people that visit the hotel. I have stayed in most of the london hotels including the Dorchester, Mandarin, Hulkins, Berkley, Ritz, and the Landsborough.  All of them are either too ""ritzy, old style"" or too ""cold, no cozziness what so ever and dull.""  The Browns is just the right style.  The Apple Crumble Pie is out of this world!!!  A MUST HAVE!!! Victorian sponge cake offered at tea time is ufffffff DELICIOUS!! My wife left the safe opened once and we had a few 1,000‚Ä¶"
December 2008,Friendly Hotel in Great Location,"While it is not cheap Brown's offers the traveler a great location, professional service, and a variety of food and shopping establishments within feet of the hotel. Despite its central location it is surprisingly quiet.  I found Londoners eager to come to Brown's for meetings."
December 2008,"Great staff, location, breakfast, not cheap, but overall worth it.","We had the romanic retreat package, as that offered an upgrade to the room.  We ended up taking a junior suite (i.e. one larger than average room with a sofa, coffee table etc.) for ¬£500 + VAT. First night included bottle of Taittinger Champagne, strewn rose petals (of limited utility) and chocolates.  The staff are excellent, they give it a small hotel feel.  Full breakfast in the room  (¬£32 each, but included in the package) was very good.  It is, of course a wonderful location if you fancy wandering around Bond Street/St James' and pretending to be uber rich.  Speaking as a Londoner, it gave me a new perspective on that part of town.  Only disappointments were that the in-room entertainment was weak (poor choice of movies, problem with sound on DVD player, radio on the blink)‚Ä¶"
November 2008,Relaxed and welcoming,"Having stayed in so called four star hotels in London before, this five star hotel was a real treat - but it is very expensive. We liked everything about Browns: the manageable size, interesting boutique style decor, the huge choice of cocktails in the bar, the charming and approachable staff, the good breakfast and the lovely room.   We we in London for my husband's birthday and to use a voucher for dinner at the Dorchester on Park Lane. The Dorchester dinner was dreadful (in the Grill restaurant: boring menu, staff who didn't make eye contact, slow service, food unexceptional). In contrast, we had dinner the following night in Browns' Albemarle restaurant, which was excellent. Interesting range of dishes and beautifully cooked. Pricey though at ¬£150 for two - without pudding. ‚Ä¶"
November 2008,"Stylish, welcoming - our favourite London hotel so far","Stayed with teenage daughters for some shopping and shows. Felt at home from the moment the doorman took our bags. Lovely bright large room - perfect temperature and so quiet despite being busy and such a central location. Very comfortable beds, good turn down service. The bathroom was large with lots of little extras. They didn't forget anything. Enjoyed breakfast each morning - both from the buffet and the a la carte selection. Concierge charged my mobile as I'd forgotten my charger, and wrapped and sent a package home for me.  Will definitely stay again and hope to visit one of the other hotels in the collection."
October 2008,"Luxurious experience, will be back soon","Browns has an ideal location tucked away in Mayfair. The staff are efficient and very welcoming. My bedroom was very comfortable, beautiful bed linen and ample toiletries.  Doyble glazing meant had a grreat nights sleep. Great breakfast too."
September 2008,Lovely Hotel with Excellent staff,"We stayed on the 'Romantic Package' to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  The telephone booking directly with the hotel was very efficient and friendly, and having visited the restaurant many years ago before the refurbishment we were looking forward to seeing the new decor.  The changes did not disappoint and the hotel has a serene atmosphere.  The doorman was welcoming and walked us to reception where the young lady was equally as nice.  We did book in at 2pm so our room was ready and after a tour of the public rooms (which are gorgeous) we were shown to our room on the 2nd floor.  Don't ask me why but I was disappointed, it was beautifully furnished but despite asking for a quiet room it overlooked Dover Street with lots of passing traffic, however good for people watching‚Ä¶"
October 2008,5 Star,"Stayed at Browns for 1 night as part of the Romantic retreat package. It was a special occassion as I planned to propose to my girlfriend. Prior to the trip I was in contact with Guest Relations to organise various things to make the proposal more special. Maria who I dealt with was superb and could not be more helpful. In addition to the various request I made, Maria was there on arrival to meet us, the icing on the cake was that she managed to uprage our room from a junior suite to a classic suite....thanks. The room was very large 80 square metres...a lounge with 3 seater couch a bang and oulufson plasma, a separate massive bedroom with another B&O tv and a huge bathroom with you have guessed it another B&O Tv in the bath... Decor is contemporary but yet classical. The whole‚Ä¶"
September 2007,Five Star with a caveat,"The most important thing about Brown's is that they are true to their reputation: They are one of the most welcoming and friendly hotels in the world.  The thing that will strike you is that everyone there is really nice and customer oriented.  It doesn't have the air of pretentiousness you find in some 5-star hotels (I say this as someone who stays almost exclusively in 5-star hotels) - instead it feels like you are at home and with friends.  The more you stay there the more striking this becomes.  The hotel itself is also excellent:  Rooms: The rooms including many of the standard rooms are spacious, comfortable and well appointed.  Many of the rooms have high pressure rain-showers which are absolutely fantastic.  The beds are probably the best hotel beds I have slept on in‚Ä¶"
August 2008,Good but with flaws,"Stayed with my wife for a ""Romantic Retreat"" week-end, after a nice week-end earlier this year at Sir Rocco Forte's Hotel de Rome in Berlin, Germany.  The good:  Location is excellent Staff is very friendly and professionel English break-fast is as it should be (fresh, plenty,...) Room was luxurious (received as part of our package upgrade to an executive room), spacious and silent. Bed was very good. The spa treatments were heavenly they make their Manhattan cocktail just ""perfect""  The ""bad"":  our ""bottle of Champagne, fresh fruit and chocolate strawberries upon arrival in your room"" arrived the second (!) day and only after asking ourselves twice. The fruit were 3 basis apples and the strawberries just never arrived.  temperature in the public spaces is too high and also in‚Ä¶"
July 2006,Amazing Stay,"I was impressed with everything. The rooms were tastefully decorated, the bed extremely comfortable and the service impeccable, the concierge extremely helpful and well-informed. I requested a SIM card and was provided with one within 15minutes. It was an amazing stay in all its aspects. I usually stay at the intercontinental hotel and stayed at the Browns due its excellent location near Bond Street. Will stay there again, there is no doubt about this."
June 2006,Fine but overrated,"Brown hotel has a good location if you want to go to the theatres and shop. Nevertheless the service comes short of what you would expect of a five star hotel.   The design is good, contemporary which we enjoy , but a little cheap and quickly put together with lots of black and white phtographs but nothing much more.   The problem is that in London you cannot find many contemporary hotels with good locations. In that respect it has an advantage. We used it once for lunch and once for afternoon tea. Both experiences were fine but nothing you cannot find in many more places in London.   Would I go back. Maybe if the price was right. You can find great discounts on the hotel through some websites. I woul make sure I discuss the room with the reservation girl on the phone as it also‚Ä¶"
December 2005,A Great Treat,"The hotel is outstanding, a definate 5 Star.   We had room service which was amazing. They set up a full table which had its own hot cupboard.  The spa treatments were very good and relaxing, I had the Jet Lag Treatment which was very much needed.  Breakfast was perfect with a great buffet and lovely menu. All the staff were fantastic.   The location of this hotel is perfect for shopping."
February 2006,Pretty close to superb,"If your are into style its your hotel. everything which belongs to design is pretty classy and nice. the service was ok (the front desk made it lose a bit). the rooms was nice but a bit small. the location is great. overall, i would stay there again, but its also not a fault to keep your eyes open for other hotels..."
January 2004,A lovely hotel to stay at,"My daughter and I just returned from a week at Brown's and found it to be a really nice hotel overall.  We had a suite with plenty of room (what a nice luxury in London!), very comfy beds (I actually miss mine!) and great service. The breakfasts were good too (try the cappucino-and all that delicious fresh fruit) although I didn't have the stomach for the heavy English breakfast like my daughter did. My only caveat would be the tea there; we found the food not that good for the  $$ price and the seats were uncomfortable for anybody over 5'2"" (at 5'8"" my legs had nowhere to go!) That being said, I would stay at Brown's anytime-one of the best!"
December 2023,Afternoon Tea,"Me and another 2 friends of mine went to Browns on a Monday aternoon to try their new service. We had been already in other London¬¥s hotel having Afternoon Tea, but this one is far form a 5* service Eventhough we new that it was quite late, they didn¬¥t have any problems into allocated us in a nice table and offeref us their champagne tea option. Well, everything seemed to go ok until we realised that no member of staff was taking care of us as our cups there not filled up, our asthray was not exchange for a new one (we are heavy smokers) and our selection of sandwiches and pastries were not replaced neither... On top of that and after been more than 45 minutes waiting for any waiter to come to our table, they realised that we were completely ignored so we decided to make a‚Ä¶"
December 2023,A True 5-Star Hotel,"This hotel is pure class.  We stayed for two nights. First of all, the thing that really stood out for me was how friendly and happy the staff members were.  This friendliness definitely set the mood for the hotel. Our room was very comfortable.  The bedding was very nice, and the furniture was very comfortable to sit in.  Many hotels nowadays opt for a minimalist approach in guest rooms which often means that the furniture is not very comfortable.   This was definitely not the case here.  The bathroom was large with a large tub, separate shower stall, and well-appointed with very nice toiletries.  My only complaint about the room was that a recycling truck came by at 4:21 a.m. and emptied the bins on the street right outside our room.  But, I guess that the hotel can't really‚Ä¶"
December 2023,We felt like celebrities,We loved Browns.  We spent Christmas Day and Christmas Evening there.  The renovations were one week old when we stayed and we are pretty sure we were using some of their cutlery for the first time ever!  The staff were lovely.  They knew exactly who we were from the moment we walked in.  I highly reccomend room service - such production value! 
December 2023,Totally refurbished and back to being a gem in London,"We stayed at Brown's for 2 nights last weekend. The hotel has just come out of a major refurbishment and is now part of the 5* Rocco Forte collection. At check-in we were upgraded from a Classic Queen to an Executive King. The room was very spacious with a huge comfy bed complete with Frette linen as well as a flat screen TV. The furniture & interiors were beautiful, with a comfy chaise long. The bathroom was almost the same size as the room! The room was adjacent to the front of the hotel in Albemarle Street which made it slightly noisy but not significantly enough to affect sleep.  The best thing about the hotel is the service from the staff - they acknowledged us everywhere we went and were always on hand to answer any questions or direct.   If you're visiting then you must‚Ä¶"
December 2023,"Good hotel, needs some TLC","While the Brown had that quintessential English shabby-chic (I hate that phrase!) there is definitely room for improvment. Good points: We stayed there for our honeymoon in January due to a really great price on a travel package. Great central location and very close to the tube. Our room was a good size, comprised of a small sitting room and bedroom and a large bathroom. I wasn't expecting much from a British hotel bathroom, having stayed at many over a three month period years before, however, I thought the victorian marble bathroom was quaint and inviting--the shower worked well and we had plenty of hot water. The soaps and toiletries were superb (Italian)! Unfortunately we blew a fuse twice in the bathroom which was an annoying inconvienince to have to let in the repair man.‚Ä¶"
December 2023,"refined, traditional but overlooked the wear and tear","Very lovely, quaint hotel in an upscale area. Serice was very good.  Beds and bath were just fine. It Definitely takes you back to the 19th century. Tea is a highlight for $200 bucks. Rooms and hotel in general need some work but if you don't look real close it is overall a very nice hotel and certainly british."
December 2023,"Tea nice, but needs a facelift","Reasonable post-xmas rate thru expedia booking ($244/night). Salon rooms very cosy, afternoon tea v. good. Central location convenient for shops (Piccadilly, Fortnum's etc). Comfortable beds, but hotel needs renovating, especially the 1950's bathrooms and elevators - I gather the new owners (Rocco Forte) will do this by 2005. Hotel a bit jumbled as made up of five different houses put together. Food is very expensive, only afternoon tea (you need to book) is really worth it. Note that if you're taking a taxi to the airport, taxi driver will pay bellhop 5 GBP for the intro."
December 2023,Not a 5 star,"While the hotel is quite nice in an antique English fashion, the only real high point was afternoon tea. It was very good . However, service in the rest of the hotel was at about a 2 star level, thus removing it from the same rating level as the Dorchester, the Savoy and the Ritz. It was not good value for the money, but it's central lcation is hard to beat. I will definitely stay elsewhere next time."
December 2023,"Lovely & posh, but very traditional & conservative","Very lovely, posh hotel in a beautiful part of London. I stayed in a standard double room, and while it was nice, the room itself was a bit dark. Beds were comfortable and linens crisp and clean. It is very much a traditional English establishment with excellent service, although I felt it a bit ""stuffy"" at times. Good for the business excecutive or a slightly more conservative traveler."
November 2023,A really nice hotel,"Very nice hotel. Very pricy. Suggest that you not use room service, although server was very nice, the price of the food was outrageous.  Never found the exercise room. Room was very well turned out. Very clean and well stocked. No view. Close to shops and just a short hop to Buckingham Palace. Concierge was very courteous as was the front desk staff. Recieved substantial discount via Expedia.com and was very happy with the stay."
December 2023,"Brown's is a lovely, elegant hotel","A lovely elegant hotel: low-key, quiet, understated, well-located.  The staff is gracious and accomodating without being the slightest bit intrusive - they go above and beyond for their guests.  We felt pampered and cared for.  The room was clean and comfortable, with a lovely bathroom and amenities.  The price is to be expected for a major city hotel of this quality.  We will return."
December 2023,A home away from home,"Our recent stay at Browns just prior to Christmas was wonderful. We had lots of logistics to deal with having various family members arriving but staying elsewhere, Christmas shopping to do, restaurant plans that kept changing, all in the busy chaos of London at Christmas but the staff were always so helpful and welcoming. They truly seemed to care about us and went out of their way to help with everything. The breakfast was superb especially the French toast and the best coffee and tea we had in London. When we first arrived in our room we thought that it wasn‚Äôt anything special but it was comfortable - great bed, clean and had everything you need. It‚Äôs the service that makes Browns special. Would definitely return."
December 2023,"Excellent, Hotel","Excellent Hotel, wonderful staff friendly breakfast was amazing service very friendly professional overall definitely 100%. The beds are so comfortable great room service very clean. I definitely would return  "
December 2023,Awesome family Christmas stay at Brown‚Äôs ,Wonderful hotel with superb staff. A special thanks to Givi who was always around to help us out. The location in the heart of Mayfair is perfect for business or hitting all the fantastic nearby shops. 
December 2023,Exceeded our high expectations,"The hotel exceeded our high expectations in all respects. The staff could not have looked after us better, and when my wife was not well, were very attentive. Particular mention for front desk, doorman and room service. The style and ambience of the hotel is as good as you could hope for a 5 star traditional London hotel, and the room was a pleasure to  stay in. The bed was very, very comfortable.  Food and drink great, including some kindly provided FOC as they knew we were celebrating a big birthday. Have booked again for our next celebration!"
December 2023,Perfect in every way!,"Perfect in every way from check-in till the to check-out. The hotel is perfect situated and decorated with love for details. Amazing breakfast. The entire staff from the front office to the restaurant were super friendly, professional and always ready to help! I especially remember Charles & Mamadou at the front desk. I felt like at home!"
December 2023,Amazing Spa,"Spa was the most relaxing experience. We had the mother and daughter treatment, and my 8 year old daughter enjoyed it as much as I did. Aurora & Fouzia are amazing!!! They are like wizards. We made it out Christmas tradition and will be coming again!"
December 2023,Luxurious Get Away,What an absolutely charming hotel! Our room was gorgeous and comfortable. But what I loved most was that the concierge team reached out to us prior to our arrival and were very responsive in helping with arrangements before we arrived. Everyone we interacted with during our stay was so lovely and welcoming. And the cocktails at the Dononvan Bar are to die for! We would love to stay at Brown's again. 
December 2023,World Class Hotel,An incredibly beautiful historic hotel with luxury written all over it. Lovely suite with all the modern necessities.

November 2023,Welcome to your London home,"Took my family to London for Thanksgiving week and couldn't be happier with our stay at Brown's.  From the moment we arrived the staff worked to make us comfortable.  We arrived around 10am from NY and were tired and needed to change.  Our rooms were not ready, but they had a room where we could change and freshen up.   They recommended a quaint lunch place down the street and by the time we finished the rooms were ready.    The location was amazing.  Steps from Bond Street (great shopping) and a simple walk from all the parks, castles and other places you want to visit when you go to London.     The rooms were much larger than we expected from a European hotel.  Many of the hotels we have stayed in are tiny, but these were very comfortable.  We stayed in rooms 203 and 204.   203 has a sitting area and a huge closet and bathroom.  204 was slightly smaller but in no way was it small.  The in-room amenities are very good.   We received water each day as well as a welcome basket of fruit and chocolate truffles.  The bathroom was modern and spacious.  The beds were comfortable, and even though we were on the second-floor sleeping was not an issue.     The staff is an 11 out of 10.  They are the most professional and friendly people you can meet.  They truly care about you and want to make you feel like you are at home.  A perfect example of how they go out of their way to make you comfortable is on Thanksgiving they sent us pieces of pumpkin pie because they knew we weren't in the US celebrating.  At every turn they were there to help or just ask how everything was going.  We wanted to see a show but failed to get tickets before we arrived but that wasn't an issue.  They called around and gave us a list of potential shows and costs.  Once we decided on a show, they arranged everything.  Truely seamless.    The restaurants were great.  We ate breakfast at the hotel each morning and it was wonderful.  We also had a late dinner one night very close to their closing time, but we weren't rushed our treated poorly due to the late hour.  In fact, they said they were there for us and would stay as long as we wanted.    We also had afternoon tea, and this was a great meal.   Donovan's Bar was out of this world.  The drinks, atmosphere and staff are why this bar is considered one of the top 100 bars in the world.   If you want to feel at home in London, I highly recommend Brown's.  We will never stay anywhere else.    ‚Ä¶"
December 2023,"Brown's is a lovely, elegant hotel","A lovely elegant hotel: low-key, quiet, understated, well-located.  The staff is gracious and accomodating without being the slightest bit intrusive - they go above and beyond for their guests.  We felt pampered and cared for.  The room was clean and comfortable, with a lovely bathroom and amenities.  The price is to be expected for a major city hotel of this quality.  We will return."
December 2023,A home away from home,"Our recent stay at Browns just prior to Christmas was wonderful. We had lots of logistics to deal with having various family members arriving but staying elsewhere, Christmas shopping to do, restaurant plans that kept changing, all in the busy chaos of London at Christmas but the staff were always so helpful and welcoming. They truly seemed to care about us and went out of their way to help with everything. The breakfast was superb especially the French toast and the best coffee and tea we had in London. When we first arrived in our room we thought that it wasn‚Äôt anything special but it was comfortable - great bed, clean and had everything you need. It‚Äôs the service that makes Browns special.

The staff could not have looked after us better, and when my wife was not well, were very attentive. Particular mention for front desk, doorman and room service. The style and ambience of the hotel is as good as you could hope for a 5 star traditional London hotel, and the room was a pleasure to  stay in. The bed was very, very comfortable.  Food and drink great, including some kindly provided FOC as they knew we were celebrating a big birthday. Have booked again for our next celebration!"

At every turn they were there to help or just ask how everything was going.  We wanted to see a show but failed to get tickets before we arrived but that wasn't an issue.  They called around and gave us a list of potential shows and costs.  Once we decided on a show, they arranged everything.  Truely seamless.    The restaurants were great.  We ate breakfast at the hotel each morning and it was wonderful.  We also had a late dinner one night very close to their closing time, but we weren't rushed our treated poorly due to the late hour.  In fact, they said they were there for us and would stay as long as we wanted.    We also had afternoon tea, and this was a great meal.   Donovan's Bar was out of this world.  The drinks, atmosphere and staff are why this bar is considered one of the top 100 bars in the world.   If you want to feel at home in London, I highly recommend Brown's.  We will never stay anywhere else.    ‚Ä¶"
December 2023,"Brown's is a lovely, elegant hotel","A lovely elegant hotel: low-key, quiet, understated, well-located.  The staff is gracious and accomodating without being the slightest bit intrusive - they go above and beyond for their guests.  We felt pampered and cared for.  The room was clean and comfortable, with a lovely bathroom and amenities.  The price is to be expected for a major city hotel of this quality.  We will return."
December 2023,A home away from home,"Our recent stay at Browns just prior to Christmas was wonderful. We had lots of logistics to deal with having various family members arriving but staying elsewhere, Christmas shopping to do, restaurant plans that kept changing, all in the busy chaos of London at Christmas but the staff were always so helpful and welcoming. They truly seemed to care about us and went out of their way to help with everything. The breakfast was superb especially the French toast and the best coffee and tea we had in London. When we first arrived in our room we thought that it wasn‚Äôt anything special but it was comfortable - great bed, clean and had everything you need. It‚Äôs the service that makes Browns special. Would definitely return."

December 2023,Awesome family Christmas stay at Brown‚Äôs ,Wonderful hotel with superb staff. A special thanks to Givi who was always around to help us out. The location in the heart of Mayfair is perfect for business or hitting all the fantastic nearby shops. 
December 2023,Exceeded our high expectations,"The hotel exceeded our high expectations in all respects. The staff could not have looked after us better, and when my wife was not well, were very attentive. Particular mention for front desk, doorman and room service. The style and ambience of the hotel is as good as you could hope for a 5 star traditional London hotel, and the room was a pleasure to  stay in. The bed was very, very comfortable.  Food and drink great, including some kindly provided FOC as they knew we were celebrating a big birthday. Have booked again for our next celebration!"
December 2023,Perfect in every way!,"Perfect in every way from check-in till the to check-out. The hotel is perfect situated and decorated with love for details. Amazing breakfast. The entire staff from the front office to the restaurant were super friendly, professional and always ready to help! I especially remember Charles & Mamadou at the front desk. I felt like at home!"
December 2023,Amazing Spa,"Spa was the most relaxing experience. We had the mother and daughter treatment, and my 8 year old daughter enjoyed it as much as I did. Aurora & Fouzia are amazing!!! They are like wizards. We made it out Christmas tradition and will be coming again!"
December 2023,Luxurious Get Away,What an absolutely charming hotel! Our room was gorgeous and comfortable. But what I loved most was that the concierge team reached out to us prior to our arrival and were very responsive in helping with arrangements before we arrived. Everyone we interacted with during our stay was so lovely and welcoming. And the cocktails at the Dononvan Bar are to die for! We would love to stay at Brown's again. 
December 2023,World Class Hotel,An incredibly beautiful historic hotel with luxury written all over it. Lovely suite with all the modern necessities.

November 2023,Welcome to your London home,"Took my family to London for Thanksgiving week and couldn't be happier with our stay at Brown's.  From the moment we arrived the staff worked to make us comfortable.  We arrived around 10am from NY and were tired and needed to change.  Our rooms were not ready, but they had a room where we could change and freshen up.   They recommended a quaint lunch place down the street and by the time we finished the rooms were ready.    The location was amazing.  Steps from Bond Street (great shopping) and a simple walk from all the parks, castles and other places you want to visit when you go to London.     The rooms were much larger than we expected from a European hotel.  Many of the hotels we have stayed in are tiny, but these were very comfortable.  We stayed in rooms 203 and 204.   203 has a sitting area and a huge closet and bathroom.  204 was slightly smaller but in no way was it small.  The in-room amenities are very good.   We received water each day as well as a welcome basket of fruit and chocolate truffles.  The bathroom was modern and spacious.  The beds were comfortable, and even though we were on the second-floor sleeping was not an issue.     The staff is an 11 out of 10.  They are the most professional and friendly people you can meet.

The style and ambience of the hotel is as good as you could hope for a 5 star traditional London hotel, and the room was a pleasure to  stay in. The bed was very, very comfortable.  Food and drink great, including some kindly provided FOC as they knew we were celebrating a big birthday. Have booked again for our next celebration!"
December 2023,Perfect in every way!,"Perfect in every way from check-in till the to check-out. The hotel is perfect situated and decorated with love for details. Amazing breakfast. The entire staff from the front office to the restaurant were super friendly, professional and always ready to help! I especially remember Charles & Mamadou at the front desk. I felt like at home!"
December 2023,Amazing Spa,"Spa was the most relaxing experience. We had the mother and daughter treatment, and my 8 year old daughter enjoyed it as much as I did. Aurora & Fouzia are amazing!!! They are like wizards. We made it out Christmas tradition and will be coming again!"
December 2023,Luxurious Get Away,What an absolutely charming hotel! Our room was gorgeous and comfortable. But what I loved most was that the concierge team reached out to us prior to our arrival and were very responsive in helping with arrangements before we arrived. Everyone we interacted with during our stay was so lovely and welcoming. And the cocktails at the Dononvan Bar are to die for! We would love to stay at Brown's again. 
December 2023,World Class Hotel,An incredibly beautiful historic hotel with luxury written all over it. Lovely suite with all the modern necessities. Absolutely fantastic service - from the moment the taxi pulled up outside - until the moment I left the Hotel. Staff were exemplary and so friendly and helpful. I will definitely come again.
November 2023,Welcome to your London home,"Took my family to London for Thanksgiving week and couldn't be happier with our stay at Brown's.  From the moment we arrived the staff worked to make us comfortable.  We arrived around 10am from NY and were tired and needed to change.  Our rooms were not ready, but they had a room where we could change and freshen up.   They recommended a quaint lunch place down the street and by the time we finished the rooms were ready.    The location was amazing.  Steps from Bond Street (great shopping) and a simple walk from all the parks, castles and other places you want to visit when you go to London.     The rooms were much larger than we expected from a European hotel.  Many of the hotels we have stayed in are tiny, but these were very comfortable.  We stayed in rooms 203 and 204.   203 has a sitting area and a huge closet and bathroom.  204 was slightly smaller but in no way was it small.  The in-room amenities are very good.   We received water each day as well as a welcome basket of fruit and chocolate truffles.  The bathroom was modern and spacious.  The beds were comfortable, and even though we were on the second-floor sleeping was not an issue.     The staff is an 11 out of 10.  They are the most professional and friendly people you can meet.  They truly care about you and want to make you feel like you are at home.  A perfect example of how they go out of their way to make you comfortable is on Thanksgiving they sent us pieces of pumpkin pie because they knew we weren't in the US celebrating.  At every turn they were there to help or just ask how everything was going.  We wanted to see a show but failed to get tickets before we arrived but that wasn't an issue.  They called around and gave us a list of potential shows and costs.  Once we decided on a show, they arranged everything.  Truely seamless.    The restaurants were great.  We ate breakfast at the hotel each morning and it was wonderful.  We also had a late dinner one night very close to their closing time, but we weren't rushed our treated poorly due to the late hour.  In fact, they said they were there for us and would stay as long as we wanted.    We also had afternoon tea, and this was a great meal.   Donovan's Bar was out of this world.  The drinks, atmosphere and staff are why this bar is considered one of the top 100 bars in the world.   If you want to feel at home in London, I highly recommend Brown's.  We will never stay anywhere else.    ‚Ä¶"
December 2023,"Brown's is a lovely, elegant hotel","A lovely elegant hotel: low-key, quiet, understated, well-located.  The staff is gracious and accomodating without being the slightest bit intrusive - they go above and beyond for their guests.  We felt pampered and cared for.  The room was clean and comfortable, with a lovely bathroom and amenities.  The price is to be expected for a major city hotel of this quality.  We will return."
December 2023,A home away from home,"Our recent stay at Browns just prior to Christmas was wonderful. We had lots of logistics to deal with having various family members arriving but staying elsewhere, Christmas shopping to do, restaurant plans that kept changing, all in the busy chaos of London at Christmas but the staff were always so helpful and welcoming. They truly seemed to care about us and went out of their way to help with everything. The breakfast was superb especially the French toast and the best coffee and tea we had in London.

They called around and gave us a list of potential shows and costs.  Once we decided on a show, they arranged everything.  Truely seamless.    The restaurants were great.  We ate breakfast at the hotel each morning and it was wonderful.  We also had a late dinner one night very close to their closing time, but we weren't rushed our treated poorly due to the late hour.  In fact, they said they were there for us and would stay as long as we wanted.    We also had afternoon tea, and this was a great meal.   Donovan's Bar was out of this world.  The drinks, atmosphere and staff are why this bar is considered one of the top 100 bars in the world.   If you want to feel at home in London, I highly recommend Brown's.  We will never stay anywhere else.    ‚Ä¶"
December 2023,"Brown's is a lovely, elegant hotel","A lovely elegant hotel: low-key, quiet, understated, well-located.  The staff is gracious and accomodating without being the slightest bit intrusive - they go above and beyond for their guests.  We felt pampered and cared for.  The room was clean and comfortable, with a lovely bathroom and amenities.  The price is to be expected for a major city hotel of this quality.  We will return."
December 2023,A home away from home,"Our recent stay at Browns just prior to Christmas was wonderful. We had lots of logistics to deal with having various family members arriving but staying elsewhere, Christmas shopping to do, restaurant plans that kept changing, all in the busy chaos of London at Christmas but the staff were always so helpful and welcoming. They truly seemed to care about us and went out of their way to help with everything. The breakfast was superb especially the French toast and the best coffee and tea we had in London. When we first arrived in our room we thought that it wasn‚Äôt anything special but it was comfortable - great bed, clean and had everything you need. It‚Äôs the service that makes Browns special.

December 2023,Awesome family Christmas stay at Brown‚Äôs ,Wonderful hotel with superb staff. A special thanks to Givi who was always around to help us out. The location in the heart of Mayfair is perfect for business or hitting all the fantastic nearby shops. 
December 2023,Exceeded our high expectations,"The hotel exceeded our high expectations in all respects. The staff could not have looked after us better, and when my wife was not well, were very attentive. Particular mention for front desk, doorman and room service. The style and ambience of the hotel is as good as you could hope for a 5 star traditional London hotel, and the room was a pleasure to  stay in. The bed was very, very comfortable.  Food and drink great, including some kindly provided FOC as they knew we were celebrating a big birthday. Have booked again for our next celebration!"
December 2023,Perfect in every way!,"Perfect in every way from check-in till the to check-out. The hotel is perfect situated and decorated with love for details. Amazing breakfast. The entire staff from the front office to the restaurant were super friendly, professional and always ready to help! I especially remember Charles & Mamadou at the front desk. I felt like at home!"
December 2023,Amazing Spa,"Spa was the most relaxing experience. We had the mother and daughter treatment, and my 8 year old daughter enjoyed it as much as I did. Aurora & Fouzia are amazing!!! They are like wizards. We made it out Christmas tradition and will be coming again!"
December 2023,Luxurious Get Away,What an absolutely charming hotel! Our room was gorgeous and comfortable. But what I loved most was that the concierge team reached out to us prior to our arrival and were very responsive in helping with arrangements before we arrived. Everyone we interacted with during our stay was so lovely and welcoming. And the cocktails at the Dononvan Bar are to die for! We would love to stay at Brown's again. 
December 2023,World Class Hotel,An incredibly beautiful historic hotel with luxury written all over it. Lovely suite with all the modern necessities.

From the moment we arrived the staff worked to make us comfortable.  We arrived around 10am from NY and were tired and needed to change.

December 2023,Awesome family Christmas stay at Brown‚Äôs ,Wonderful hotel with superb staff. A special thanks to Givi who was always around to help us out. The location in the heart of Mayfair is perfect for business or hitting all the fantastic nearby shops. 
December 2023,Exceeded our high expectations,"The hotel exceeded our high expectations in all respects. The staff could not have looked after us better, and when my wife was not well, were very attentive. Particular mention for front desk, doorman and room service. The style and ambience of the hotel is as good as you could hope for a 5 star traditional London hotel, and the room was a pleasure to  stay in. The bed was very, very comfortable.  Food and drink great, including some kindly provided FOC as they knew we were celebrating a big birthday. Have booked again for our next celebration!"
December 2023,Perfect in every way!,"Perfect in every way from check-in till the to check-out. The hotel is perfect situated and decorated with love for details. Amazing breakfast.

December 2023,Luxurious Get Away,What an absolutely charming hotel! Our room was gorgeous and comfortable. But what I loved most was that the concierge team reached out to us prior to our arrival and were very responsive in helping with arrangements before we arrived. Everyone we interacted with during our stay was so lovely and welcoming. And the cocktails at the Dononvan Bar are to die for! We would love to stay at Brown's again. 
December 2023,World Class Hotel,An incredibly beautiful historic hotel with luxury written all over it. Lovely suite with all the modern necessities. Absolutely fantastic service - from the moment the taxi pulled up outside - until the moment I left the Hotel. Staff were exemplary and so friendly and helpful. I will definitely come again.
November 2023,Welcome to your London home,"Took my family to London for Thanksgiving week and couldn't be happier with our stay at Brown's.  From the moment we arrived the staff worked to make us comfortable.  We arrived around 10am from NY and were tired and needed to change.  Our rooms were not ready, but they had a room where we could change and freshen up.   They recommended a quaint lunch place down the street and by the time we finished the rooms were ready.    The location was amazing.  Steps from Bond Street (great shopping) and a simple walk from all the parks, castles and other places you want to visit when you go to London.     The rooms were much larger than we expected from a European hotel.  Many of the hotels we have stayed in are tiny, but these were very comfortable.  We stayed in rooms 203 and 204.   203 has a sitting area and a huge closet and bathroom.  204 was slightly smaller but in no way was it small.  The in-room amenities are very good.   We received water each day as well as a welcome basket of fruit and chocolate truffles.  The bathroom was modern and spacious.  The beds were comfortable, and even though we were on the second-floor sleeping was not an issue.     The staff is an 11 out of 10.  They are the most professional and friendly people you can meet.  They truly care about you and want to make you feel like you are at home.  A perfect example of how they go out of their way to make you comfortable is on Thanksgiving they sent us pieces of pumpkin pie because they knew we weren't in the US celebrating.  At every turn they were there to help or just ask how everything was going.  We wanted to see a show but failed to get tickets before we arrived but that wasn't an issue.  They called around and gave us a list of potential shows and costs.  Once we decided on a show, they arranged everything.  Truely seamless.    The restaurants were great.  We ate breakfast at the hotel each morning and it was wonderful.  We also had a late dinner one night very close to their closing time, but we weren't rushed our treated poorly due to the late hour.  In fact, they said they were there for us and would stay as long as we wanted.    We also had afternoon tea, and this was a great meal.   Donovan's Bar was out of this world.  The drinks, atmosphere and staff are why this bar is considered one of the top 100 bars in the world.   If you want to feel at home in London, I highly recommend Brown's.  We will never stay anywhere else.    ‚Ä¶"
December 2023,"Brown's is a lovely, elegant hotel","A lovely elegant hotel: low-key, quiet, understated, well-located.  The staff is gracious and accomodating without being the slightest bit intrusive - they go above and beyond for their guests.  We felt pampered and cared for.

The location was amazing.  Steps from Bond Street (great shopping) and a simple walk from all the parks, castles and other places you want to visit when you go to London.     The rooms were much larger than we expected from a European hotel.  Many of the hotels we have stayed in are tiny, but these were very comfortable.  We stayed in rooms 203 and 204.   203 has a sitting area and a huge closet and bathroom.  204 was slightly smaller but in no way was it small.  The in-room amenities are very good.   We received water each day as well as a welcome basket of fruit and chocolate truffles.  The bathroom was modern and spacious.  The beds were comfortable, and even though we were on the second-floor sleeping was not an issue.     The staff is an 11 out of 10.  They are the most professional and friendly people you can meet.  They truly care about you and want to make you feel like you are at home.  A perfect example of how they go out of their way to make you comfortable is on Thanksgiving they sent us pieces of pumpkin pie because they knew we weren't in the US celebrating.  At every turn they were there to help or just ask how everything was going.  We wanted to see a show but failed to get tickets before we arrived but that wasn't an issue.  They called around and gave us a list of potential shows and costs.  Once we decided on a show, they arranged everything.  Truely seamless.    The restaurants were great.  We ate breakfast at the hotel each morning and it was wonderful.  We also had a late dinner one night very close to their closing time, but we weren't rushed our treated poorly due to the late hour.  In fact, they said they were there for us and would stay as long as we wanted.    We also had afternoon tea, and this was a great meal.   Donovan's Bar was out of this world.  The drinks, atmosphere and staff are why this bar is considered one of the top 100 bars in the world.   If you want to feel at home in London, I highly recommend Brown's.  We will never stay anywhere else.    ‚Ä¶"
December 2023,"Brown's is a lovely, elegant hotel","A lovely elegant hotel: low-key, quiet, understated, well-located.

December 2023,Very nice hotel with a terrible F&B program,"Great location, friendly staff and spacious rooms. The downside is that the onsite Italian restaurant is horrendous as is the room service and you may sit at the bar for 30-45 min and never see the bar tender. I would expect more from a company that is trying to be a luxury brand. That being said, nice stay. "
December 2023,Our favourite London hotel. ,"We got married and came here after our ceremony, the team made us feel so special and was the perfect end to our perfect day!   Everyone you interact with is lovely and personable the service impeccable.  No matter who you are, or how busy it is there, you are made to feel like you are the only guests they are looking after!  The food is incredible, we literally wanted to eat everything off the menu!   Cant wait to return.  "

November 2023,"Excellent hotel, detail oriented, would recommend ","Excellent hotel.  This hotel was exceptional in customer service and value. My only issue was lumpy mattress that needed to be replaced as well as I was put in a handicap room - not my choice. But they did recognize my birthday with a lovely cake, flowers and balloons. That‚Äôs made the stay even better. Hotel room was clean, quiet, and all snacks and beverages were included, and refilled daily. I would highly recommend this hotel and stay here again. "

Absolutely fantastic service - from the moment the taxi pulled up outside - until the moment I left the Hotel. Staff were exemplary and so friendly and helpful. I will definitely come again.
November 2023,Welcome to your London home,"Took my family to London for Thanksgiving week and couldn't be happier with our stay at Brown's.  From the moment we arrived the staff worked to make us comfortable.  We arrived around 10am from NY and were tired and needed to change.  Our rooms were not ready, but they had a room where we could change and freshen up.   They recommended a quaint lunch place down the street and by the time we finished the rooms were ready.    The location was amazing.  Steps from Bond Street (great shopping) and a simple walk from all the parks, castles and other places you want to visit when you go to London.     The rooms were much larger than we expected from a European hotel.  Many of the hotels we have stayed in are tiny, but these were very comfortable.  We stayed in rooms 203 and 204.   203 has a sitting area and a huge closet and bathroom.  204 was slightly smaller but in no way was it small.  The in-room amenities are very good.   We received water each day as well as a welcome basket of fruit and chocolate truffles.  The bathroom was modern and spacious.  The beds were comfortable, and even though we were on the second-floor sleeping was not an issue.     The staff is an 11 out of 10.  They are the most professional and friendly people you can meet.  They truly care about you and want to make you feel like you are at home.  A perfect example of how they go out of their way to make you comfortable is on Thanksgiving they sent us pieces of pumpkin pie because they knew we weren't in the US celebrating.  At every turn they were there to help or just ask how everything was going.  We wanted to see a show but failed to get tickets before we arrived but that wasn't an issue.  They called around and gave us a list of potential shows and costs.  Once we decided on a show, they arranged everything.  Truely seamless.    The restaurants were great.  We ate breakfast at the hotel each morning and it was wonderful.  We also had a late dinner one night very close to their closing time, but we weren't rushed our treated poorly due to the late hour.  In fact, they said they were there for us and would stay as long as we wanted.    We also had afternoon tea, and this was a great meal.   Donovan's Bar was out of this world.  The drinks, atmosphere and staff are why this bar is considered one of the top 100 bars in the world.   If you want to feel at home in London, I highly recommend Brown's.  We will never stay anywhere else.    ‚Ä¶"
July 2023,"Brown's is a lovely, elegant hotel","A lovely elegant hotel: low-key, quiet, understated, well-located.  The staff is gracious and accomodating without being the slightest bit intrusive - they go above and beyond for their guests.  We felt pampered and cared for.  The room was clean and comfortable, with a lovely bathroom and amenities.  The price is to be expected for a major city hotel of this quality.  We will return."
July 2023,A home away from home,"Our recent stay at Browns just prior to Christmas was wonderful. We had lots of logistics to deal with having various family members arriving but staying elsewhere, Christmas shopping to do, restaurant plans that kept changing, all in the busy chaos of London at Christmas but the staff were always so helpful and welcoming. They truly seemed to care about us and went out of their way to help with everything. The breakfast was superb especially the French toast and the best coffee and tea we had in London. When we first arrived in our room we thought that it wasn‚Äôt anything special but it was comfortable - great bed, clean and had everything you need. It‚Äôs the service that makes Browns special. Would definitely return."
July 2023,"Excellent, Hotel","Excellent Hotel, wonderful staff friendly breakfast was amazing service very friendly professional overall definitely 100%. The beds are so comfortable great room service very clean. I definitely would return  "
July 2023,Awesome family Christmas stay at Brown‚Äôs ,Wonderful hotel with superb staff. A special thanks to Givi who was always around to help us out. The location in the heart of Mayfair is perfect for business or hitting all the fantastic nearby shops. 
July 2023,Exceeded our high expectations,"The hotel exceeded our high expectations in all respects. The staff could not have looked after us better, and when my wife was not well, were very attentive. Particular mention for front desk, doorman and room service. The style and ambience of the hotel is as good as you could hope for a 5 star traditional London hotel, and the room was a pleasure to  stay in. The bed was very, very comfortable.  Food and drink great, including some kindly provided FOC as they knew we were celebrating a big birthday. Have booked again for our next celebration!"
July 2023,Perfect in every way!,"Perfect in every way from check-in till the to check-out. The hotel is perfect situated and decorated with love for details. Amazing breakfast. The entire staff from the front office to the restaurant were super friendly, professional and always ready to help! I especially remember Charles & Mamadou at the front desk. I felt like at home!"
July 2023,Amazing Spa,"Spa was the most relaxing experience. We had the mother and daughter treatment, and my 8 year old daughter enjoyed it as much as I did. Aurora & Fouzia are amazing!!! They are like wizards. We made it out Christmas tradition and will be coming again!"
July 2023,Luxurious Get Away,What an absolutely charming hotel! Our room was gorgeous and comfortable. But what I loved most was that the concierge team reached out to us prior to our arrival and were very responsive in helping with arrangements before we arrived. Everyone we interacted with during our stay was so lovely and welcoming. And the cocktails at the Dononvan Bar are to die for! We would love to stay at Brown's again.

January 2023,4-star hotel in a 5-star area,"Hotel is nice but nothing really special. A couple of mechanical problems but the staff fixed them and was willing to relocate us if we were dissatisfied (the fixes worked but we were told the problem - condensation pump failure - happened all the time during the summer). Staff was very friendly and hotel is in a very good quiet part of Belgravia, near the foreign embassies and a short walk to Hyde Park and to Victoria Station. I don't think we'd stay here again - because there are lots of other choices in London not especially anything against the hotel."
January 2023,Amazing stay,"Last weekend we had the opportunity to stay at The Hari hotel again. Amazing as it has always, on the top of its game for years. The rooms have been recently refurbished and given a new light to its luxury. Bed is soooo comfy.... Dinner was assisted by super starts Sante and Evie. Whatever you order, consider a small portion of their divine cacio & pepe pasta. Thank you again"
December 2022,The Hari is a Top Notch Hotel,"The Hari is a top notch hotel.  The rooms and common areas are extremely well maintained with mid century modern decor.  The staff is especially impressive; they were friendly and helpful during our entire stay.  I highly recommend this property,   Note:  We frequented a fabulous little cafe around the corner from The Hari,  Anya Cafe.  It‚Äôs perfect for sitting outside to people watch while having breakfast, lunch and drinks.  "
December 2022,Very Comfortable Stay,"The staff at the hotel from the reception to the concierge, the people at the front door and at the restaurant were all very frinedly. The hotel is locted in a great location close to meny great restaurants and shopping areas. The rooms like new and were very comfortable."
January 2023,Very Nice Boutique Hotel-needs some adjustments to earn 5 Star rate and pricing,"hotel lovely-staff very helpful Bar was not properly stocked-many items on menu unavailable for the week were there. AC definitely inadequate in room and public spaces-welcome dinner with Grand Slam Tennis tour overwhelmingly HOT. Fans set up but where was AC? never given answer except ""Working on it"""
December 2022,5-star experience,"I had a very positive experience at the Hari when I visited earlier this summer. I found the staff was helpful and friendly, and the rooms were well-appointed and clean. The location was fantastic as well!  I will definitely plan to stay at this property again on my next trip to London."
December 2022,"Amazing service, amazing food",I went to the Hari first floor for the food & the Waitress Evie was absolutely amazing. She recommended us the best food we could‚Äôve possibly eaten & it was worth EVERY single penny. I will definitely be coming back & getting the same food again. The whole staff was excellent and so helpful as well. Thank you Evie & the Hari team once again. It was a pleasure. 
December 2022,"Fantastic, warm welcome",A year since we were last here. What a lovely warm welcome. Made us feel like we were coming ‚Äúback home‚Äù.  We cant recommend this hotel and its team. More highly.  Fantastic service and location. Many thanks.
January 2023,"I had great experience with The Hari Hotel, at Il Pampero Restaurant London highly recommended","Me and my girlfriend decided to come and eat at Il Pampero at The  Hari Hotel, we got  a very pleasant  welcoming   from Naomi the assistant Manager, we got the best ever most  delicious cocktails from the barman Gigi. Our table was professionally taken cared of by Lionel  the waiter. The food was excellent, everything about their service is handled professionally. Highly recommended i am giving it 5 stars"
January 2023,"Meh. Very good, but on the pricey side for what it is.","Overall, our stay was fine. Our deluxe room was very small but well-appointed. The biggest issue for me was the noise as our room was right behind the elevator and across from the cleaning staff room. That means they were constantly in and out of the room across and it was not until late in the evening that the buzz and talk outside our room was done with.  The room condition was a mixed bag. Upon arrival, the air conditioning wasn't cooling very well and no amount of thermostat changes had an impact on the temps in the room. We asked for engineering to come in and take a look while we were at dinner and upon our return the AC worked better. The shower fixture was loose from the wall (almost like someone slipped at some point in the past and tried to break their fall by hanging‚Ä¶"
November 2022,Lovely Spontaneity at The Hari,"My partner and I recently stayed overnight at the lovely Hari in Belgravia. Our spontaneous visit was incredibly relaxing and full of thoughtful touches from staff, including a personalized welcome note and delicious treats waiting in our room. Our view of London was to die for and our accommodation very luxurious. From our bed, we fell asleep with The London Eye, St. Paul‚Äôs and The Shard in our eyesight. We enjoyed a restful night and woke refreshed, the perfect tonic to a long week. You‚Äôll be hard-pressed to find a better location to lay your head in the heart of one of London‚Äôs most beautiful neighborhoods. We would not hesitate to re-book at The Hari and hope to visit again soon!"
October 2022,Great hotel,"Fantastic service, loads of little touches above and beyond expectations (room prep, freebies, quality of minibar offer etc), cant really say more.... great restaurant as well - best hotel ive stayed at in London."
July 2022,Great place to stay in London,"Fabulous stay,  comfortable beds, great facilities, friendly helpful staff. I loved staying there and will definitely be back. And we had a fabulous view as well. Great location  in a lovely area with easy access to tourist  spots"
October 2022,Wonderful pre-Christmas stay at The Hari,"We had the most superb stay here just before Christmas. Unfortunately, my house move didn't quite go to plan, so after a very long day of packing, we checked into The Hari - which was an incredible treat! We arrived late evening after dinner, and upon check-in were invited for a drink in the bar - the Christmas decorations and Christmas tree were phenomenal.   When we then got up to the room, it was perfect - we were only on the 6th floor - but could still see The Shard and The London Eye from our window - I imagine the top floors have even more incredible views. Unfortunately we travelled without a toothbrush and toothpaste, and upon calling room service, they were brought up in minutes by housekeeping. After a hot (waterfall!) shower, the beds were so comfortable, just what we‚Ä¶"
October 2022,Best experience in London ever,"I had an amazing time there with my wife. It's the best place I've stayed in London, Alex was so nice with us and was there to answer all of our needs. A lot of advices to make our stay perfect and help us during our visit in London. "
October 2022,Top in Belgravia,"Great hotel, and great staff .  At the bar , Pepe is amazing , welcoming us in a proper way and the cocktails he made to us where unbelievable.  We took breakfast at the restaurant, I appreciate much the Italian eggs with burrata and truffle, also Ariana suggested us the blueberry smoothie. Was amazing.  Hope to come back soon"
October 2022,A 4-Star with 3-Star problems,"We just returned from an extended Xmas to New Year's stay at the Hari Hotel.   There are plenty of positives to say and a few disappointments that I'll address in this review.   First and foremost, as part of my company's corporate rate, it's a great place. When we extended our stay, management advised that our rate wasn't available for New Year's Eve. However, I begrudgingly accepted the new rate; they replied and agreed to honor the corporate rate, so hat's off to customer service.   The room was much smaller than we're accustomed to in London, with only two drawers in the closet and about a little under a dozen hangers. If you're staying for an extended stay or with family be prepared to mostly live out of your suitcase.    The room had a very nice extended little seating‚Ä¶"
September 2022,Beautiful hotel with great service and food,"Food and drink was amazing, really well made and beautifully made cocktails! And the service by Vittorio was fantastic and he checked up on us throughout the night! A great way to spend NYE. The hotel was almost beautifully decorated "
October 2022,Business Stay,"I stayed on business for a couple days due to the train strikes. The rooms are comfortable and come with an array of amenities. On arrival I had a delicious pastry and was sent up a much welcomed whisky sour, which must have been noted as my drink of choice from my previous stay!  The breakfast service was very efficient and set me up well for the day. The hotel is set in a great location and you cannot fault it.  The staff are always welcoming and I look forward to my next stay."
October 2022,The Disappointing Decline of The Hari,"Disappointing decline of The Hari, which is a shame as I am a regular guest to the hotel and especially to the restaurants/dining areas, but the unfriendliness, lack of respect and abrupt nature of the front-facing staff is simply unforgivable. It was not too long ago London's hospitality was begging for international visitors to return...you'd think they would keep this in mind when interacting with guests in an irritable manner for no reason at all. Sadly it's becoming known among our circles that The Hari is not what it used to be. P.S When we interact with your staff with politeness and respect, we expect a little of that back..especially as regulars."
November 2022,The Hari..you are Exceptional!,"Back again and this was another perfect stay. The service, and the hospitality of this place just gets better and better. Such a cozy and lovely boutique hotel. This is the place to stay in in London. Perfect location. We can walk to Harrods, Hyde Park and the lively Knightsbridge area which is around the corner. The bed is super comfy and Bruno at the front desk is so nice and so helpful . The entire staff is extremely helpful and make you feel at home."
December 2022,Perfection,"What a gem, everything about our experience was special from the start to the end the super slick service, stylish on trend interior.  Best nights sleep and  bathrooms to die for.  Immaculate rooms and impeccable  service, attention to  detail.   Will not stay anywhere else in London ever again, certainly a 5 star experience, luxurious. "
November 2022,Hari London,"Unique hotel with unique rooms overlooking a garden.  Separate window box sitting areas and/or tubs very nice.  Rooms not large but well finished.  Very good restaurant for breakfast, nice bar for pre night cocktail or late night cap.  Location excellent walked to most everything.  Had a challenge with AC a few hot days in June but got through it.  Expensive but for London, location and quality, a repeat for us."
November 2022,"Plush, understated and personal","I was drawn to this property for its location (near where I wanted to be in the city) and its smaller size. I wanted a quiet hotel in a serene part of town and that's exactly what The Hari delivers. The service I experienced was very good which started with my room being ready early. My travel plans changed while I was there and they also helped me extend my stay one night and remain in the same room.  I love the understated elegance of the hotel. It's posh but cozy. With only 80-some rooms it never felt crowded anywhere including the two elevators. In fact, I only rode the elevator with another person once. I dined in the restaurant several times during my stay (breakfast and dinner) and thought the food and atmosphere was lovely. I also enjoyed a drink in the bar (with their‚Ä¶"
November 2022,A great stay at the Hari London,"We had a super wedding anniversary celebration at the Hari. Nice spacious quiet room. Helpful staff throughout. Good restaurant and excellent Belgravia location, close to Piccadilly, Knightsbridge, Sloane Square and Victoria."
November 2022,Lovely welcome and stay,"My friends and I with their two small children had a lovely stay and lunch at the Hari , the team made us feel welcome and at ease and were so nice to accommodate us with a large table and a dedicated service. Alex and Vittorio took excellent care of us all. The children and us loved the food and will definitely be back again."
November 2022,Great place to stay in Belgravia,"Great location, great staff, nice and clean  rooms and bathrooms and impeccable service. The personnel is helpful and efficient.  I love the Hari and would highly recommend it. The bar is also a nice hang out with amazing drinks and the Italian restaurant is so good!"
November 2022,So very grateful,"My experience at this wonderful hotel is fairly unique.  For me, unfortunately, my first time ever to London I was quite sick.  The hotel was comfortable, clean, well appointed, cozy, classy and the staff was first rate. They were all exceptionally kind and encouraging of my situation and in particular Bruno....we was very supportive and went out of his way to be helpful.  Someday I hope to have a 'do-over' in London and return to this special hotel....and hopefully see less of my room and more of London!  "
November 2022,The ripple effect of contentment,"This is by far one of the best five-star stay experiences I have ever journeyed. A customised guest experience that‚Äôs as unique as to its art collection displays and parallel to their staff members‚Äô characters. Catered to us with gourmet Italian brunch to hand written welcome notes and souvenirs.   The impressive experience was made obvious for us to  extend our welcome to host our friend for a drink, to do a must-try their very special curated list of cocktails. The Hari experience has the ripple effect to pass on smiles.  A special thanks to Arianna, Mattia, Sante, Maria and all the F&B staffs."
November 2022,This is the place to stay in London,This is our fourth stay at The Hari. It has been wonderful. Rooms lovely. Service excellent. Front of house engaging and warm. Breakfast ( cooked by Federico  S) just sublime. Just a great place to be to escape the rush of London. Location perfect. Central but quiet.
September 2022,Cozy stay and I also love the neighbourhood!,"After traveling around the Europe for a week and more, I was back to London, where I last travelled to three years ago. I spent my first few nights at The Hari, London. It was some vey quality and relaxing time!   The Hari London is located at the heart of Belgravia, bordering the areas of Chelsea, Kensington and Knightsbridge. I have stayed at some other areas (Mayfair, Marylebone and Canary Wharf) before and just like what Google said - Belgravia is ""unlike anywhere else in London"" and the Regency architecture is of such a unique, elegant glamour.  The Hari London itself is a very beautiful property and both the public area and the room design were really cool. The lounge area was very comfy with a wide collection of artworks around. The suite I stayed was really nice and my‚Ä¶"
August 2022,Wonderful stay,"Wonderful experience staying at The Hari; everyone was very nice and professional.  The only comment I have is that I wish the bathroom had more privacy as it is completely transparent, not very convenient when one wants to use the facilities and have guests in the room. "
August 2022,Beautiful boutique hotel in the heart of London,"Beautifully appointed luxury hotel in the heart of London near Harrod's.  I stayed here on business but what a perfect location for being in the center of the sites. The room itself was gorgeous with high-end products and amenities. I love when hotels provide slippers -it seems such a simple gesture, but means the world to me.  They also had me at the chocolate truffles left on the desk and chocolates on the pillow after the turn-down service (they know the way into my heart)."
August 2022,An incredible experience from start to finish!,The entire team at The Hari went above and beyond during our stay! The suite was stunning and the location can‚Äôt be beat.  We‚Äôll be staying here again during our next trip to London!  Sincerely appreciate everything about this place!
August 2022,what an amazing hotel,"What can I say about my experience at this hotel ?  Just one word, spectacular. They welcomed us with a warm welcome along with a cocktail, a special thanks goes to Naomi and Sandra who assisted us all the time with a smile and with so much kindness. Also I was amazed by the beauty of the hotel, the photos did not make enough, an immensity of details that are highlighted by the beautiful lights. The way the hotel is divided into two parts has made me crazy, below we have a room characterized by the restaurant and quiet music and overwhelming for those like me love to relax and above we have a more cheeky and refreshing side for those who love fun. Thanks again and can‚Äôt wait to return"
August 2022,"Great service, perfect location and very elegant boutique hotel.","It was my first time at The Hari and, I must admit, it was not my first choice when I was looking for a hotel. Mostly because I knew nothing about it. It was the Founders Card representative that insisted that I was going to be extremely pleased with the whole experience and that, for sure, I would become a repeat customer. She was right! I will be going there once again in December and probably every time I will be in London. Great service, perfect location and very elegant boutique hotel."
August 2022,Great service and amazing service,"One if the best hotels I have stayed at in London. The service is amazing and the staff are very helpful. Also the location is perfect, close to everything and a short want to the best places.   Will definitely stay here again and I would recommend it"
August 2022,An incredible experience from start to finish,"An incredible experience from start to finish.  Alex at the front desk, Ben the concierge and the doormen were all very helpful.  Can‚Äôt wait to stay here again and will be back soon on our next visit to London!"
August 2022,Perfection,This was our second stay at the Hari and we had the most wonderful experience. We truly feel like guests when we stay at the Hari! The entire staff is friendly and goes out of their way to ensure you have a great experience. They know the true meaning of hospitality!
August 2022,A wonderful stay,"I had a wonderful stay at this 5 star hotel whilst I travelled on business. The welcome from the reception was very warm on arrival and everything was prepared as I had requested. I had asked for a room with a bath if possible and I was delighted that they accommodated my request.   I thought the price point was great for a hotel in this area and of this standard, it had a small intimate feel to it and it felt very comfortable. The room itself was small but lovely and perfectly adequate for my needs.  The complimentary minibar was a lovely touch. Turndown was offered both nights, one night I had some chocolates and the second night a wax lip balm which were both excellent.   The hotel prides itself on sustainability and it was great to see the considerations that had gone into‚Ä¶"
March 2022,Joyful and romantic!,This is our second time staying at the Hari. Last year we got married in London and this is where we stayed. It made total sense to come back for our anniversary and the hotel only gets better. The staff are lovey and welcoming. The rooms are lovely. And the mezzanine bar area and roof terrace are a joy for just chilling. To top it all off they left a stunning combination of flowers and cake in our room to help us celebrate! I couldn‚Äôt recommend a better hotel in London!
August 2022,Another great stay,The Hari is the most friendly place without being intrusive. Lovely staff.  Bedrooms are really comfy and thank god for the totally fantastic air conditioning! Ive left a review before but am happy to do another because it is such a well run hotel.
August 2022,Excellent service!,"My husband and I traveled for 4 weeks across 4 different countries, and our favorite stay was at the Hari.  The team at the Hari provided excellent service. Maria at the front desk greeted us with a warm welcome and sent us a complimentary bottle of champagne and bar snacks (we were on our honeymoon). Several kind surprises were left at our room for us to celebrate. Diego, at concierge, was incredibly helpful in assisting us with bookings for restaurants, and gave us some great recommendations too.   Second, the rooms are cozy and comfortable. The Hari also implements sustainable practices to make their business more environmentally friendly, such as card-activated electricity. As someone who tries to make eco-conscious decisions, I appreciate these details!  The Hari is also‚Ä¶"
August 2022,a disappointing new experience in London,"Great staff and very welcoming, good location. However extremely disappointing room. Very small despite being premium, and really impractical bathroom. Lots of noise from road and passers by below, and we were on 7th floor.Restaurant good quality, service and ambience, shame about the room."
August 2022,MyaforiteplaceinLondon,"I‚Äôve been in the Hari hotel because my husband organised a dinner as a surprise for my birthday in the italian restaurant Il Pampero and what to say ?! Everything was exceptional we were so happy to be seated in the booth that was really romantic and on the table was a little card from the Hari staff and a rose, for dinner we had the seabass in crust salt and Naomi the supervisor was looking after us and she was so knowledgeable we also meet the Chef Andrea that suggest some dishes for the next time because we will come back for sure.  At the and the waitress Deborah did a little cake with the candle on top.  For me was the best birthday ever and next time i will stay for sure at the hotel because the staff and the food is so authentic italian!!"
July 2022,Wonderful Hotel,We recently had a wonderful short stay at the stunning Hari Hotel. The service we experienced was nothing short of excellent. The attention to detail throughout the hotel is superb. Big thank you to Jorge and Charlie Brown who helped with the details of our reservation. Can‚Äôt wait to return!
June 2022,Calm in the city,"Lovely hotel. Done properly with attention from the staff and calming atmosphere after a busy day in the city. We used the parking so easy door to door. Great access to parks, shopping and concerts at the Albert Hall."
July 2022,Outstanding stay,"Room, staff, food‚Äîall excellent. Any extra or special request was attended to right away and correctly. The architecture of the rooms brings the outside inside, while maintaining privacy. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for better. "
June 2022,the Hari,"Amazing service, really nice environment and  good for cocktails and food.   The service as i mentioned was amazing, thanks to Vittorio we had such an amazing experience; Super professional, attentive to the detail and really kind.  100% recommended"
June 2022,Gorgeous food at The Hari,"I went to The Hari with a friend for dinner and was blown away.. The restaurant team were one of the best I‚Äôve seen for a while extremely knowledgeable, warm, friendly and very genuine I was really impressed!   The food was really my favourite was the risotto gorgeous flavours   Thank you Hari I will definitely be back!"
May 2022,Wonderful stay all thanks to a wonderful staff!,"I stayed at The Hari back in March, the staff and facilities were awesome! All of the staff members were thoughtful and made an effort to ensure my mother and I were well taken care of throughout our stay. All of the food was delicious, I miss the room service breakfast! The hotel was quiet and very well located, within easy walking to distance to Harrod's, Belgrave Square and many other sights. I highly recommend staying here and would stay here again when I make it back to London"
May 2022,A hidden Gem of a restaurant,The three of us were warmly welcomed in a very elegant and atmospheric restaurant. We were taken to our seat in a booth where we could see the sky above us and the staff was so alert and very pleasant. We were served by Vittorio who seemed to have an extensive knowledge of the menu and wine selections and he was simply delightful. The food was delicious! Each dish were beautifully presented and full of exciting flavours. The menu wasn‚Äôt overwhelming so we enjoyed being able to pick many dish so we could share. We will definitely go back just to try the rest of the menu as it was truly delicious. Overall we had a wonderful experience and highly recommend this Italian restaurant in this elegant and friendly hotel in Mayfair.
May 2022,Absolutely fabulous,"Excellent in every way. . Wonderful staff, superb room, first class food and service. Nothing is too much trouble. Our second visit and will definitely stay again. Lovely part of the city. Beautiful restaurant"
May 2022,Exceptional Boutique Hotel,"My husband and I took our daughter to The Hari for 3 nights her 6th Birthday and wow what an experience! Beautiful hotel, fabulous staff and so friendly. The attention my daughter received from the staff especially the fabulous Maria and the Guest Services Team was faultless. They made her and our stay out of this world. Rooms are lovely and spacious with superb amenities. The staff all treated our daughter like a princess and nothing was too much trouble. They all went above and beyond to ensure she had a fabulous day. My husband and I were also exceptionally well received. The breakfast is delicious and so much choice!! The Restaurant Il Pampero was exceptional. The whole stay was perfect and we will definitely be returning. One word FABULOUS"
May 2022,Elite Hotel,"Great experience that solidified my future return to this beautiful city of London! Establishments of this caliber (5 star) tend to have an element of pretension. Not at the Hari! Pure class, genuine smiles and professionalism by everyone you encounter. It is an wonderful experience throughout and the service is truly the heart of the hotel. I look forward to returning in the future!"
April 2022,My favourite hotel in London,Had a fantastic stay again at The Hari. Love the team and atmosphere. Have booked my next stay for Christmas already. Can‚Äôt imagine staying anywhere else in London now. They make you feel so special.  See you soon!
May 2022,Wimbledon trip,"The stay for this trip was generally very good. I was impressed by the attention given by the staff of the hotel with one minor exception. The food experience was not what I had hoped for as, despite a very sparse breakfast clientele, it took a great deal of work to get the attention of the staff in the main restaurant to get attended to with service requests and the bill. Despite this I would return to the Hari as it had a character that I enjoyed."
April 2022,"Best place to stay in Belgravia, Knightsbridge, Chelsea, Kensington","Our third visit now. This place has a fantastic location. Friendly and willing staff throughout. Clean rooms and bathrooms. Great bar food, drinks and cocktails. Infinitely better value than the Carlton Towers."
April 2022,Always terrific ,"Always terrific, the team at The Hari are excellent at making guests feel at home and welcome. Super location, great service, lovely rooms. The restaurant, Il Pampero, is worthy of a special mention as weel"
April 2022,A lovely place to stay in London!,"Clean, accommodating, friendly, excellent service. The food was delicious, the drinks exemplary and the staff highly professional. We were there for Wimbledon- highly recommend this hotel. Shopping and Buckingham Palace just a short walk away. "
July 2022,Exceptional weekend stay at the Hari,"I stayed at the Hari over the weekend, and had a fantastic experience throughout! We were welcomed by Diego and Claudio who were incredibly friendly and helpful, and we were offered a nice welcome drink at the bar (amazingly made cocktails, lovely stylish setting). Our room itself was nice and spacious, with a beautiful bathroom which had a big bathtub (my bath in there felt like a spa experience). The brunch the next day was lovely too, and the service was friendly and attentive. The decor in the restaurant is beautiful and elegant too, as it is throughout the hotel to be honest.  Everything was brilliant. Thank you to everyone at the hotel who made my stay so enjoyable!"
July 2022,Amazing stay at a beautiful hotel in the heart of chelsea!,"We stayed at the Hari this past weekend and everything was 10/10 from start to finish. Matthew greeted us upon arrival and was friendly, welcoming and offered great recommendations for restaurants in the area. The lounge and restaurant are amazing as well as the phenomenal service from the front desk team. We felt taken care of and the staff really do care about our stay. Will 100% be returning!!"
July 2022,Amazing service!,"I fell in love with this hotel! Went for a weekend getaway to London with friends and enjoyed the warm service. Location of the hotel is perfect! We were made to feel at home immediately! I usually don't like to spend too much time in a hotel when traveling, but the atmosphere and team were so refreshing and professional, we felt very comfortable. We even decided to have the weekend bottomless brunch which was delicious! What a treat! Special thanks to the excellent service from Alex and Ariana throughout the stay! We will be back!"
June 2022,Brunch at The Hari,"I got to enjoy a beautiful brunch in The Hari; the food was amazing and the service exquisite. The setting was nice and we got to enjoy some live music! Alex seem to have everything under control perfectly and Ariana catered to our every need. I want to take this opportunity to thank the staff from The Hari, I will definitely recommend and come back"
July 2022,Look no further for first class,"My wife and I recently spent a week in London staying at The Hari. The words that immediately come to mind are professional, helpful, friendly and personal. Notwithstanding these impressive behaviours by every member of the team, the quality of our room was first class and we were graciously upgraded to a larger room on arrival given our 7 night stay. The location is second to none and London is easily accessible by foot, the underground or taxi. We have no doubt that the experience is a reflection of a positive culture lead by senior concierge Ben Malpass. Exceptional!"
June 2022,Family weekend,"My daughter and I came to The Hari for a pre-exam relaxing weekend. This isn‚Äôt our first visit and, again, we were hugely impressed. The staff are amazing, so welcoming and attentive - always looking to see how they can make your stay perfect. The room was gorgeous with a beautiful view over the park and stocked with everything you‚Äôd need. Thank you for such a wonderful stay, we‚Äôre looking forward to seeing you all again !!"
June 2022,Cannot wait to return,A completely faultless stay. A very friendly and welcoming greeting by members of reception and concierge. The bar had a lovely ambience. Very comfortable and spacious room which was tastefully decorated. Unfortunately we didn‚Äôt eat at the hotel but the restaurant looked very inviting and will definitely make a reservation the next time we visit. Hard pushed to find a nicer location in London. The service from all staff was exceptional. 5 stars from us.
June 2022,Hidden gem with incredible service,"My stay at The Hari was just wonderful. I was charmed by the team, they are all extremely attentive to our needs. I slept like a baby, the bed is so comfy, and the design is superb. This hotel has a great soul, I highly recommend it while staying in London."
June 2022,An intimate city escape ,"Coming back to The Hari feels like coming back home - not just the familiarity but the warmth of the hospitality and service. The King Premium rooms are spacious by London standards, the Bar and The Italian restaurant have an easy intimacy, superbly helmed by Juan and Giuseppe respectively. The hotel is populated with exciting contemporary art and the decor suggests warmth and brilliant design. The neighbourhood now has amazing shops and cafes and bars that add to the whole experience.  Overall - a property that becomes a residence whenever one is in London. "
June 2022,Nice but ...?,So reading the waxing lyrical reviews of this hotel we expected something more.   Don‚Äôt get me wrong it is a decent place with very nice staff but to be the number four (at time of writing) London hotel on TA is frankly absurd.   We spent three nights in a Hari Suite.  One reason we took this suite was because of the fireplace which we love while in the UK.  More later ‚Ä¶ Welcome is fine.  D√©cor and entrance are nice but underwhelming by 5 star London standards. Lifts are small.   We had booked a table on the ‚Äòbeautiful‚Äô terrace for dinner.  You could not make up how unlovely this small room is.  As it was populated by a family with kids and the size of my living room it was not conducive to a peaceful evening.  We assumed it was a holding area or bar but no ‚Äì this was the‚Ä¶
April 2022,Just the Best!,"We stayed here for our bucket list trip to Wimbledon and will now add this hotel for a return trip.  Impeccable service, fascinating artful decor, fully-equipped rooms, luxurious amenities and bedding."
March 2022,"Relaxed, luxurious, accommodating","The hotel, staff, location, and amenities were excellent. One of the best hotels I've ever stayed at. I've never met nicer hospitality staff. The coffee was amazing, brunch was delicious, and rooms were luxurious. Staff was eager to help with all requests and really went a mile above and beyond expectations. "
April 2022,Favourite Hotel,Favourite hotel in london!! Service is impeccable.. extremely friendly staff and helpful! Beautiful interiors and delicious food! I will keep on returning! Recommend it highly to regardless of the purpose of the trip
April 2022,Great Stay!,"We had a great time at The Hari.  This hotel is in an excellent area of London, within walking distance to all of London or a short walk to the Tube so you can access more!    The only improvement I would say is that they could use some better options their restaurant menu as well as having fresh coffee available the lobby for guests would be so helpful!  "
April 2022,Amazing staff and hospitality,"When we arrived at the Hari Hotel after our 8 hour flight from Atlanta, GA, we were greeted by w by three staff members before we  reached the front desk. Throughout our stay , they were unfailingly courteous and friendly. They even gifted  us with truffles with the  flag on them  on July 4!  Ben, the concierge, even loaned na a phone cord. Thehitel d√©cor was lovely with many interesting works of art everywhere. The  king sized bed in our suite was really comfortable  and I slept like a baby for the 6 nights we stayed there. Located in Belgravia, we were walking distance from many attractions. Altogether, this was truly a five star hotel."
April 2022, A Haven in Landon‚Äôs Belgrvavia Neighborhood ,"Beautiful Hotel in Belgravia neighborhood of London. A true 5 star hotel, central to many of London‚Äôs best museums , restaurants and shopping. Staff is both helpful and friendly. The in house restaurant ‚ÄúIl Pampero‚Äùis a delightful Italian restaurant. Rooms are kept impeccably clean and have modern electronics and WiFI. This was our second visit to this hotel and we found it just as delightful as our first visit. Concierge service is very helpful in arranging dining and theater reservations . Most notable were Ben and Diego, both were knowledgeable and easy to chat with. Naomi, in I‚Äôll Pampero, was extremely knowledgeable and helpful with wine and food selection. We truly enjoyed our 10 day holiday."
April 2022,Enjoyable long stay at the Hari,"I stayed for just over 2 weeks in a smaller suite and was very happy with my stay - Room was perfect - spacious, quiet and good temperate control - Staff were incredibly helpful and polite, always on top of everything and went the extra distance to make sure everything was ok"
April 2022,Excellent hotel,"Great location; helpful, friendly staff; extremely comfortable, quiet rooms.  Highly recommend.  If/when we are back in London, this is where we will stay again.  Very accommodating hotel located in a lovely, walkable neighborhood with a wide variety of restaurants nearby, as well as a nice dining option in the hotel."
April 2022,A GREAT HOTEL FIND IN LONDON,"The hotel staff is very welcoming and professional. My husband and I arrived on an overnight from the US, and we were given our room immediately, a true gift. Every person with whom we interfaced was a pleasure and very accommodating. The value proposition here is excellent. My only disappointment was with the restaurant, likely not owned by the hotel. The breakfast was completely overcooked and non-edible."
April 2022,My favorite hotel in London - and I‚Äôm a Londoner!,"I have been staying at The Hari several times a year since it first opened. It is in a superb location, and has stunning contemporary yet sophisticated rooms and communal spaces. But what makes The Hari is the staff, they almost become friends over time, and do everything they can to make you feel welcome, appreciated and looked after. Personalized, warm service, that makes you feel special. This is a hotel where the little touches are done to perfection. I far prefer The Hari to much better known (world renowned) establishments in London."
March 2022,Bar and Terrace,"Had wonderful time in this lovely place, the atmosphere is cozy and private had a magic memory of the supervisor Naomi suggesting us what to drink from their signatures cocktails,  For sure we will come back asap"
March 2022,incredibile experience,I had such a fabulous stay in this place becoming my new favorite place for cocktails and food in central London . They welcoming us since the beginning and the cocktail list is fabulous. Many thanks to Naomi to make our cocktails with such an attention to the details and to Kyanu for making our evening special and unforgettable we will come back for sure!
March 2022,Great little boutique hotel,"Liked everything about this hotel but most of all the lovely friendly staff. The hotel has a warmth and distinctiveness that you just don‚Äôt get chain hotels.  Room we had was very comfortable, tastefully decorated and in excellent condition.  Breakfast is a  la cart and of a high quality.  It‚Äôs in a quiet area with no noticeable street noise.  Despite it being in a quiet area it‚Äôs a good base with easy access to all parts of the city. A couple of tube stations less than 10 minutes walk.  A big thumbs up!"
March 2022,Visit to our friendly Hari Hotel,Friendly staff - our home from home in London - bar area exceptional and location great - can walk to everything - if you don‚Äôt know about this hotel you should check it out - chef in restaurant produces amazing Italian dishes 
March 2022,"Best place to have a rest after intense day of work , recommend for solo visits , nice bartenders Victor and Giusepe","It was a lovely time what I spent here. Special thank for Victor the bartender and waiter Sergio, who are good company. I can‚Äôt wait to go back with my friends and family, to have the same wonderful experience. Also big plus for smoking cigars in the terrace. The all team were super friendly and adorable. Many thanks!"
February 2022,Amazing Hotel!!,"Amazing experience. My husband has cancer and this was a big trip for him. He mentioned that he really liked the art behind the desk because he has flown jets and Bruno and Maria bought a frame and sent a photo of the jet with a lovely card and chocolate to him. Our concierge, Ricardo was also amazing. Everyone was so friendly and went out of our way to make us comfortable. "
February 2022,Made Our Trip,"Maria and the team went above and beyond when we stayed with them. They really did make it a trip to remember. It was my partners birthday and they helped me with the surprises for my partner. I really couldn't have asked for it to go better. Nothing was an issue, and the bed gave me one of the best night sleeps I've had in a long time. I wish I could have taken it home!"
February 2022,The Perfect London Location,"from a warm, welcoming reception to the most delicious food during the stay, I would recommend the Hari for those who might be unsure of where to find the best of the best in London. The hotel and staff are not pretentious in the slightest but the whole experience still feels very exclusive and special. You can walk to all the finest places and the retreat to the most comfortable and quiet room for a great night sleep. Looking forward to next time!"
February 2022,Unforgettable Experience,"I‚Äôve  been with some friends to this unbelievable place, we were welcoming from the beginning from the doorman (I think his name was Chris). We had a reservation for the restaurant but we decided to go for a drink to the bar first, where Naomi gave us a very warm welcome. She patiently describes the stunning art cocktail list, i tried the cocktails dedicated to Banksy.  Then we went to the restaurant where Giuseppe and Sandra make us feel at home. The octopus was the best thing of my life!  We will definitely come back, and maybe try to have a night in this wonderful place, thank you all!"
February 2022,Brilliant service,"Would highly recommend the minute you walk in you feel very welcome, the staff are so friendly and polite. We had drinks in the beautiful terrace. The hotel was very clean and I loved the decor! Can‚Äôt wait to visit again."
March 2022,Impeccable service,"I just recently had the pleasure of experiencing The Hari for the first time,  and my stay here was first class. The highlights for me were the exemplary service, Alex in particular (one of the managers)  was a real gem and a credit to The Hari, and also the food was outstanding.  Would recommend 100%"
February 2022,Beautiful experience,"Had the best 10 years anniversary with my boyfriend, the Hari is a place to be in Belgravia, the staff was very caring especially Alex who Made us feel special. Thank you to all we will return. Thank you to all , we will return for another amazing experience."
March 2022,Superb in every detail,"It becomes clear quite quickly that a lot of thought was put into this hotel. Everything's works well. It has a "" relaxed-chic"" vibe - it feels so more authentic than other of the other 5 star hotels in London! Check in was quick and friendly, concierge was extremely efficient. The room has comfortable beds, quality towels, blackout blinds. But the bar ( oh, the Bar), is where it really stands out! A nice ambiance, a very skilled bar and Marta! Marta made us feel extremely welcome, always there to help with a big friendly smile. We had a drink at the hotel and headed out to the Bar at the Connaught only to come back running to the Hari. It felt like were coming back home. The bar closes at 1 and we staying until 3 with a supply of drinks and having a great time. Thanks again‚Ä¶"
September 2021,The coffee,"The place was very nice and the staff were kind and lovely  their coffee is amazing, there was an employee named Marta she‚Äôs lovely and amazing person. That Coffee will be my best place and coffee in world not just in London"
November 2021,"Beautiful dinner at ""Il Pampero""","We arrived with my friend early evening for a cocktail at the Hari Bar. It was quiet but service was impeccable. They are really attentive and definitely know what to recommend.   Cocktails were nicely presented, very-well balanced and really good as well. We then continued our evening at ""Il Pampero"". We both took a pasta dish to start. I highly recommend the ""Tortello Ripieno di Carbonara"". It was absolutely delicious !!! As a main course, my friend had the Monkfish and I tried the tagliata, both of them amazing. As a whole, the service was really with a special attention to details, very smiley staff which just brings the experience to a whole new level ! Very happy and would definitely come back!"
September 2021,Fabulous & friendly ,"I had such a fabulous stay. The rooms are beautiful, spacious and comfortable & the staff so welcoming and friendly. My new favourite hotel in London. Great bar serving delicious food and cocktails. The perfect end to a long day working or shopping. "
December 2021,"Beautiful room, great staff!",My wife and I stayed at the Hari with our 8 month old baby over the weekend and loved our stay. From the moment we checked in the staff were incredibly friendly and very helpful with setting up the cot in the room ahead of time and making our stay very comfortable. The room service was delicious and arrived quickly. The bed was far more comfortable than any I‚Äôve had in other London hotels. Our daughter used the massive bath like a swimming pool. Breakfast arrived as expected with fresh juice and French press coffees.   The only thing I didn‚Äôt like was that we had to leave so soon. I can‚Äôt wait to stay at the Hari again!
March 2022,Great Place,"I had a couple of long business days and to avoid the commute stayed up in town. Couldn‚Äôt ask for a better place to stay. Very convenient central London location, efficient and friendly staff and a very comfortable bed. Special thanks to Charlie in reservations for organising the booking and to Fernando for such perfect breakfast service."
March 2022,Good Times,We enjoyed another wonderful stay at The Hari to celebrate my husband‚Äôs birthday. Many thanks to Sabrine and Bruno for such an easy check-in and also to Juan and Naomi for making our evening at the bar so enjoyable. We also very much appreciated the delicious birthday  chocolate pastry treat.
March 2022,That's amore,"We had an amazing dinner at ‚ÄúIl Pampero‚Äù for S.Valentine day. Everything was perfect, the set menu was fabulous!  A special thank you to Naomi and Giuseppe that makes our night even more special, they took care of all the small details to make our night unforgettable. Thank you The Hari, we will definitely come back."
March 2022,A wonderful experience.,"Our second visit to The Hari did not disappoint.  An amazing and helpful staff work at this hotel.  Everyone is friendly, and welcoming.  The rooms are large (for London) and very well appointed.  Housekeeping (daily) is well done.  The food and beverage options in the bar and restaurant are very good.  Nothing about The Hari disappoints.  The location in Belgravia is excellent for those that like to walk and see the sights.  The hotel is also very close to several London Tube stations."
March 2022,Amazing to be back,"Another more than great visit at The Hari! I must say I do feel at home there. The staff is super well trained and friendly. The food and accommodation are of great quality! The value for money is amazing even more as it is in Belgravia, one of the most exclusive district in the world. It feels so special! Also had the pleasure to meet Andrew again, the general manager who runs this place very well. I am becoming a true ambassador as it is so rare to find such authentic hotel!"
November 2021,Great location. Great service,"The location of The Hari is fantastic and away from the hustle and bustle of London and in the village atmosphere of Belgravia, it‚Äôs restaurants, cafes and boutiques‚Ä¶but only a few streets from London‚Äôs main roads. The staff were really helpful and the doormen were great and very helpful in getting taxis. Well worth staying and we will be back someday."
October 2021,Friendly,"Booked one night with my son for a 21st birthday shopping trip.  The hotel very kindly left a bottle of champagne, a card and a cake in our room which was a lovely touch.  The door/reception staff were all friendly and helpful.  Few negatives - no bath, no heated rails or anywhere to hang towels other than in the toilet which is where they were put, is that hygienic?  Our TV didn't work at all despite lengthy attempts by a porter and we had a poor experience at the bar.  But....  The location is fantastic, the room was comfortable, clean and quiet (some other guest disturbance but nothing major) and having the car valet parked was useful.  Would definitely return."
October 2021,Fabulous stay for our anniversary,"The most special stay for our anniversary! The Hari is magical in all ways, the staff are so friendly and helpful, the atmosphere is both luxuriously calm but also really lively. I couldn't recommend a stay at The Hari more. From the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out it was complete bliss. We will definitely be staying again - as soon as possible!"
October 2021,Visit from Pittsburgh PA for son's bachelor weekend and football match,"I stayed at the hotel years ago under different name, and while great then, it far exceeded this time round.  We were visiting for my sons bachelor weekend and to explore and see a football match from Mar 10-14.  From day of arrival reception from front desk staff (didnt get name but 10 am hour on March 10) Diego and doorman, all made us feel very welcome and took care to assist with storing bags till room ready.  The rooms and service were excellent each day, clean and refreshed.  We ate breakfast several days and received excellent service in restaurant.  The highlight of our stay though has to be the treatment and service we received in the upstairs bar area each night when returning from our day out.  From night 1 meeting Marta and her setting the tone of excellent service,‚Ä¶"
October 2021,Disappointing,"This hotel (I think) was an ex-Sheraton and it is not up to normal London standards. The bar is cramped and the service is really slow and over priced. The terrace is more like a tiny yard, so don't be fooled by the wide angle photo. The rooms are pretty small as is the shower room. For the prices charged we have stayed in much better London Hotels. Everything was just OK and that is being kind. Oh, except the staff who are lovely"
October 2021,Incredible stay!!,"This stay has been incredible. Nothing to fault. All staff have been amazing. So friendly and helpful. But have to highlight in particular how incredible Maria has been. She went above and beyond to make my partners trip so special and I‚Äôm so grateful. She organised cake, balloons, drinks, chocolates. She‚Äôs amazing! We have thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Thank you to you all! We would definitely stay here again and bring our pup next time! Fab location too."
October 2021,Little Gem,"My friend and I visited the Hari for brunch in the Italian restaurant and enjoyed it so much we stayed in the hotel for more drinks.  This is a real gem of a place with very attentive staff especially Kyanu who was a delightful waiter, nothing was too much.  We will definitely be back I can't recommend this beautiful hotel enough."
March 2022,Great little hotel!,My friend and I attended the Hari for dinner recently and all I can say is what a gem! The minute we walked in we felt welcome. All the staff were friendly and happy to help.  The cocktails were superb and the food delicious. The service was quick and efficient.  I love the decor. Especially the current Beatles pictures on display. A must for any fan.  The Manager Alex was so warm and helpful when we asked for recommendations of local places and knowledgeable in his directions.  It‚Äôs the loveliest place I‚Äôve been in a while. Will definitely be back.
December 2021,Amazing experience,"I came on  the 4th with a friend of mine to the hari and was the first time for us, we had a reservation to the restaurant but we went first to have a cocktail in the bar where peppe welcoming us and suggest two of the art cocktail list and they were amazing!! Than we went to the restaurant il pampero and Naomi and Sandra were looking after us suggesting food and wine  .All the staff was so welcoming and so knowledgeable we will come back for sure !!"
December 2021,Exceptional Hotel,"The Hari is a wonderful hotel located in  Belgravia. The area is gorgeous and perfect for walking and wandering around. The Hotel is exceptional, however what makes it stand out are the staff who really go above and beyond. It is walking distance to shopping, wonderful restaurants, and a couple of tube stations. It is easy to get to all the major sites. Traveling from the USA is a little challenging with all the Covid requirements that seem to keep changing‚Ä¶.however, Diego was so helpful and made navigating this very easy!! We will definitely be back, and you should not miss out on this gem of a hotel!!"
December 2021,"Beautiful rooms, accommodating staff",This was the nicest hotel we've stayed at in London.  Beautiful spacious room.  All the staff were very friendly and eager to help.  It made traveling during these crazy covid times a bit easier!  And just a 10 minute walk to Harrods!
December 2021,The Hari Hotel,"Absolutely an outstanding hotel!!!  I cannot recommend this hotel enough; Location, staff, food are all simply wonderful!  If you plan on going to London your stay should be at the Hari Hotel!!!  We would like to say a huge thank you to all the staff that ensured we had a 5 star stay and made our vacation even better than we could have imagined!!!  Don Caron Canada"
December 2021,Another Perfect Stay,"Flawless service from exiting the cab to checking out. Friendly, helpful staff. We had a complimentary upgrade to a suite which was a really lovely surprise and much appreciated. Beautiful room and a bottle of chilled welcoming Champagne. Bed very comfy. All that was missing was snacks and chocolate in the mini bar but Waitrose is around the corner!"
December 2021,Even better post-pandemic!,"I have not been back to the Hari since the pandemic, and I was delighted to find it even better than my memory of this always first-rate boutique hotel.  The staff were not just friendly and accommodating, but genuinely seemed delighted to be there in their various roles, from front desk to bar service, to delivering drinks to the room.  I had several large meetings to attend by video, so pushed hard on the house internet without any difficulty.  The room was super comfortable, but it was the staff that made the visit exceptional."
December 2021,Best of the best,Noone quite does it like the staff at the Hari. Every detail from the minute you book is well thought through and personalised to your experience. I would never stay anywhere else in London and can only hope they continue to expand their hotel portfolio. Everyone goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome and not enough can be said about the attention to detail. Highly recommend to anyone and everyone. My favourite hotel for a truly luxury experience.
December 2021,Fantestic,"For me the best hotel in London, only a brief stay this time but felt very welcome, lovely spacious room. Helpful friendly staff especially Matt who greeted me in reception. Perfect, looking forward to our next visit."
November 2021,CAN'T WAIT TO RETURN,"My wife and I were fortunate to spend a night at The Hari last week. What a brilliant place to stay in London.  The welcome at reception was so very friendly, the room was very good, the evening meal and breakfast were superb and the service throughout the hotel was brilliant. Thanks to all the great staff at The Hari."
November 2021,Great luxury customer journey through out,"Visited the Hari at their bar&lounge on a Monday evening. Definitely the best Monday blue remedy. The warm ambience can only be described as parallel to Hari's service. The manager, Sante, was a delightful character. He had the right balance of friendliness and efficiency and was personable, so were the other staff members, they made sure that we had everything we needed. The entire customer journey was just perfect; from the moment you enter the door to the moment you leave and be left with a warm-hearted smile. I can't think of a better way to end our night."
October 2021,Great hotel and location,"Very nice property and attentive staff. I particularly appreciated the black out electric shade, haven't slept so late in years. Also great location. Not the crazy London tourist feel but only a few blocks from excellent retail, would definitely return."
October 2021,Great hotel for a London break,"From the minute you enter, the hotel staff can‚Äôt do enough for you. We visited as a family and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The location is great for shopping and local eateries. The bar at the hotel had a great atmosphere.  Overall the hotel has a personal feel and a gem of a find‚Ä¶"
October 2021,It was HARI-mazzzing !,"I went to the Hari a few times and I can tell that I have never found a place as good as this. Everything was great ! The entire staff was amazing and made me feel so welcome. If you are looking for an exceptional experience where each detail is tailored made for you. Just book it as I cannot wait to return. Yes, it has become my home away from home.   Thank you to the staff, especially to John who I had a pleasure to meet."
October 2021,The place to stay above any other in London.,"When the world is volatile and verging on crazy, the Hari provides a tranquil, beautiful, safe and home like setting in the middle of Belgravia. Recently stayed at the Hari and everything was perfect! The room, lounge bar, terrace and gym were all great - I‚Äôd recommend this place above any hotel in a London!"
September 2021,Wonderful hotel and people,"We spent a long holiday weekend in London at The Hari. The hotel property, inside and out, is beautiful and exactly as advertised. The Hari Suite room we had was comfortable, super clean, lovely. What impressed us most was the people at the hotel ‚Ä¶ totally helpful, friendly, nice, available from the first exchange at the check in desk to our checkout. We loved it here and would definitely stay here in any future trip to London. "
October 2021,Awesome!,"Really loved the bar, and the environment. The decoration was really nice! If someone could experience I would recommend to enjoy at least one of the many cocktails! üòÅ Couldn't had been attended better, the staff (if I didn't forgot the names: Marta, Naomi, Ariana and Sandra) that served us was very attentive and funny! Great experience!"
October 2021,Thank you so much,"Andrew, Aleks, Matt and of course the rest of the team, thank you so very much for taking care of us...again! Nothing is off the table with this crew in regards to the hospitality we received. My vocabulary runs out of superlatives in how best to describe this hotel........"
October 2021,Amazing,"Amazing experience, really nice selection of spirits, the staff was execellent. We want to thanks Marta for the professional service provided! We are looking forward to be back at the harri!  So lovely atmosphere!"
September 2021,Extremely pleasant,"A great experience with a great host, with an extremely pleasant yet pleasant staff from entry until you‚Äôre at your room. First time at the hotel and surely and hopefully will not be the last as The Hari will be the first hotel to be on the list for future visits to London."
September 2021,A Precious Jewel!,"What an amazing gem of a place to call home for a few days! Our first experience in London straight from Heathrow at 7:00 AM on a Sunday morning, greeted by a full staff ready to exceed every expectation. Marzia and Richardo, and the door men who greeted us, where the first in a line of professionals who met our every need and answered all our questions.  The surprise treats in the room, perfect dining recommendations, and the lovely craft cocktails at the bar made us feel like VIPs for four days. We cannot express enough gratitude for making 35 wedding anniversary like our honeymoon ‚ù§ ‚ô•.  Thank you all, we will return!"
July 2021,Best Bartender Ever,Pepe and Juan and Louise are the best ! Best cocktails and service ! Ever ! I feel like they are family! And Moreüíú I felt very welcomed in The hari everytime I see them ! They always smile ! ALWAYS ! Even on the worst days
August 2021,Amazing! 5 star and Dog Friendly!,"Thank you for an amazing stay! Firstly, the hotel is stunning and you really have thought about every detail.

August 2021,A touch of Luxury,"Very attenuative staff and looked after from the front door in and out.  Beautiful rooms, comfy bed and fantastic shower. London Belgravia perfect base. Great choice of Drinks and Cocktails Lovely breakfast. "
August 2021,A chilled weekend,"WE had a postponed weekend at The Hari , we just needed to chill . And bot did we . From the moment we arrived we had ""just the right amount ' of service , we were helps and assisted but not bothered , all the team at The Hari seem to instinctively know when we needed help. All the team were brilliant. Thank YOU"
August 2021,"Excellent service, comfortable and stylish room","The staff at the Hari went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed, including advising on covid testing and making us comfortable when we arrived before our room was ready. The Hari is smaller than some other top London hotels but I find that an asset and would compare it favorably with them."
August 2021,Fantastic week-end,"A hidden gem in the middle of very in a very exclusive area .  From the moment you arrive at the Hari you are made to feel very welcome. The location is great, close to Buckingham palace, and also 3 tube station, within 10 minutes  walk,  giving it great access to the rest of London. The bedroom was sparkling clean with some lovely finishing touches . Can't wait for a return visit. A credit to all the staff."
August 2021,Amazing,"I had a great time at the hari , Marta and vittorio were very welcoming. Amazing drinks . And a cool vibe  All the staff are very welcoming and nice , had a greasy evening in the bar and restaurant . Highly recommend"
August 2021,Hooray for the Hari!,"A wonderful welcome by the receptionist, assistance by the Porter and even the maintenance team, who cut through the padlock on our suitcase as we‚Äôd miss-placed our key, made our initial impression one of outstanding hospitality.  The room was extremely well furnished, with all the expected high end touches for a hotel in Belgravia. A minor inconvenience were the bedroom doors closing mechanism which did not dampen the door from hitting the jamb; so irregular noise as adjoining rooms closed their doors.  The post booking and pre-arrival emails were the best digital marketing we have experienced; with numerous suggestions as to how we could enjoy our stay."
August 2021,Wonderful hotel,"Our daughters organised an overnight stay with breakfast as a surprise 50th Wedding Anniversary present. The hotel was amazing, and all the staff attentive and helpful. We had a lovely large room on the 6th floor , exceptionally clean , super comfortable bed and pillows and we  were really surprised when a chilled bottle of wine and yummy chocolates were delivered to our room courtesy of the management. .Thank you so much !  The reception staff were exceptionally helpful when we had a problem in the restaurant with our breakfast. (See separate review). They dealt with this immediately and professionally."
August 2021,Gem of a hotel!,"We had booked tickets for the Chelsea Flower Show and decided to make a weekend of it and booked The Hari for a couple of nights. Great location - away from all the hustle and bustle, but just a few minutes walk away from Chelsea and Knightsbridge. Hotel definitely has a boutique feel about it - stylishly furnished. Super classy but understated. The rooms are great - views from the 10th floor are superb! Restaurant and bar are great (try the bottomless brunch!) However it is definitely the staff that make this hotel memorable - nothing it too much trouble and everyone is so friendly, taking time to chat and ask about your day. This hotel is a must!"
September 2021,Great stay and service,Stayed for two nights and had a wonderful stay. Location of the hotel is ideal. Amazing service and were happy to accommodate any request. Will be returning to The Hari in the future ad look forward to it
September 2021,BEST HOTEL!!,"All the staff at The Hari are welcoming, happy and friendly. Greeted us with big smiles and made us feel special.  Our room was spacious and clean. House keeping was spot on.  Room service was amazing and assistance was always immediate.  The food at The Hari was delicious and made to perfection.  The lobby, restaurant and bar area were comfortable and it was a chilled environment.  Definitely we will be visiting again. In fact, probably won‚Äôt go to any other hotel. Honestly The Hari is THE BEST"
September 2021,I wouldn‚Äôt stay anywhere else!,"Having spent two nights at The Hari on the weekend of my wedding, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd ever look at any other hotel in London.  The hotel is cool, quirky, in an absolutely brilliant location, has the friendliest staff of any hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed at, and feels 100% premium throughout. In particular, Ben and Diego on the concierge team were so helpful to me and my parents ahead of and during our stay.  There‚Äôs clearly been a lot of thought and care put into the design of the hotel, from the slick lobby area to the colourful and inviting lounge on the mezzanine level, right through to the selection of art books throughout the hotel.  We stayed in a suite on the 7th floor. The room was very spacious with a great bath surrounded by windows, making you feel completely open to taking in‚Ä¶"
September 2021,outstanding,"If I had to describe my experience at tha Hari in one word it would be outstanding, the staff are so amazing, helpful and always at your disposal. Upon arrival we met Renata and she was absolutely fantastic! Then we went to our room and I have no words to describe how nice it was,they prepare for us a nice plate with little chocolate and a lovely card from the reception were they welcoming us at the Hari,then we went to the bar on the first floor and we meet Vittorio ready to welcome us he show us the garden terrace and we had a lovely dinner there with our waiter Alessio with a nice bottle of Italian wine recommend from Vittorio!! The next day we had a great breakfast at pampero with Juan who made us the best latte ever !! After checking out Alex and Dominique there were ready‚Ä¶"
September 2021,Memorable Experience,"Very charming boutique hotel in the heart of London. Excellent walking proximity to Harrods, Knightsbridge, and Sloane Square. Very accommodating and friendly staff throughout hotel. Rooms are definitely on the smaller side but still comfortable enough. Very nice terrace restaurant and upstairs bar lounge to end your day with a nice drink and snacks.  I had a bit of an issue throughout my long stay and the Operations Director, Alex as well as the GM, Andrew were immediately hands on and ensured to further accommodate my needs and have me enjoy the rest of my stay. This is the type of management that makes a huge difference in hospitality and creates a memorable experience for the guest. Had a very lovely stay and will certainly come back again! I Highly recommend this hotel for‚Ä¶"
September 2021,Perfection ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶,"We enjoyed another weekend break at The Hari. It is always a pleasure to go back with its relaxed feel, super comfortable rooms and friendly staff. It is always a stress free check-in with Sabine at reception and Ricardo on concierge and Luis always makes it very easy to enjoy Friday nights in the bar. Not forgetting of course Fernandez who serves the best breakfast.! We‚Äôll be back soon."
August 2021,"Classy 5 Star Hotel in the best part of London. Perfect for a business trip, London holiday or Intimate Corporate event","Had a lovely stay at The Hari London. Wonderful, helpful team and great location. Classy lounge / bar area with beautiful decor and friendly, attentive staff. A must visit for the garden terrace, perfect for a balmy summer evening and a cocktail. Will definitely be back to enjoy the food at the restaurant. Perfect location for a corporate event now that London is back in business."
August 2021,The New Standard,"After retiring from 40 years in hospitality, I know get to write my first review and it pleases me no end that this review should be glowing. I have had the very good fortune to travel to many corners of the world and to many 5 star hotels. However, the main issue that I have encountered is that at 5 star standard the experience can be diluted by overtraining or the size of the venue and subsequently the outcome can become clinical and lack personality. Not here. With the backdrop of Covid and the subsequent fallout in the hospitality sector, trying to maintain a standard must be near impossible but somehow The Hari are managing this just fine. From the second the doors opened, till the second they closed behind us I have never encountered such personality, hospitality and care.‚Ä¶"
August 2021,WOW...what a gem!!!!,"What an amazing hotel!!! We stayed there 3 nights and I must admit it‚Äôs the most fabulous hotel I ever stayed....from beautiful, spacious and very clean rooms to absolutely incredible staff of the hotel. From the moment you walk in you feel very welcome and comfortable...nothing is a hassle...and believe me you don‚Äôt want to leave!...would I recommend that hotel?...hellllll yesssss!!!!"
August 2021,Home from home luxury,"We had a 2 night stay at The Hari in August and will definitely return. From the moment we arrived to departure we received 5 star service, the staff were very genuine in their intentions to make our stay as comfortable as possible.   We were met by a lovely chap who opened the taxi door, welcomed us and took our luggage. From that moment on and throughout our stay we felt home from home, nothing was too much trouble.  We booked premium adjoining rooms so our teenagers could have their privacy but also be close by. We closed the doors between us at night; they were happy to stay awake til later and we didn‚Äôt have to be disturbed.  The rooms are well equipped with everything you could need, our youngest had forgotten to pack his toothbrush and was able to use the complementary‚Ä¶"
August 2021,Wedding anniversary celebration,Just spent our Anniversary at the Hari and could not have been more impressed  From the moment we arrived to the moment of check out it was truly amazing  The staff went that extra mile to make our stay special with complimentary fizz and upgrade  I am planning my next visit already as a Christmas pressie to myself and my daughter   Well done Hari team and thank you   Sharon
August 2021,Enjoyable visit but not sure it lives up to the hype,If you read the other reviews it is entirely right that The Hari receives a range of praise and accolades but can I say it knocked me off my feet? Probably not.   The rooms (suite) and bar area were nice enough and the service is very good but I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs the most interesting of places to spend time in or particularly memorable. Breakfast was good.
August 2021,Wonderful Hotel Experience,We visited the Hari for our wedding.  From the moment we arrived the staff made us feel super welcome and were constantly looking for little details that would make our stay even more lovely.  The hotel itself is very well presented with an eclectic decor done to a very good standard.  The breakfasts in particular were fantastic.  We loved every minute of our time at the Hari and will be returning!
August 2021,Amazing bottomless brunch,"Amazing brunch and atmosphere, Vito was amazing in looking after us and the whole team is just so attentive. They even have amazing gluten free pasta, I had the clams spaghetti and the vitello tonnato, but the  tiramisu is to die for, too bad is quite small as I would have gladly ordered another one. Loved the live music too."
July 2021,Such an amazing time!,"I came to to the restaurant Il pampero to try the new brunch with a friend and I have to say that it‚Äôs one of the best experience I‚Äôve had! The food and the offering is great, a lot to choose from wether you want a traditional dish or go for oysters or one of the Italian speciality. On top of that they offer options for bottomless and I must say the quality of the drinks is also 5 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è!  The team who I knew from before was as always amazing, especially Sante, Vittorio and Nando!  Congratulations to the GM who is leading these amazing people!!  Can‚Äôt wait to be back!!!"
August 2021,Amazing experience,"Had an amazing experience at the restaurant  today with a friend. We didn‚Äôt book and walked in and were so warmly welcomed from the door to the restaurant staff that we decided to have lunch. The food, drinks and service was just spot on! The atmosphere made us travel away from London‚Äôs busy streets. I will definitely recommend and go back. Can‚Äôt wait to visit again. Thank you to Nando and Alex and the rest of the team who were exceptional."

July 2021,"Friendly staff,fantastic service with that personal touch","lovely quiet location. Beautiful hotel with spacious rooms including great amenities and a really comfortable bed.Staff were very pleasant and accommodating,always a smile. We as a family stayed at this hotel as we were going to be visiting  Warner Brother Studio tour. On our arrival to the hotel room we were greeted with a tray of beautiful individually designed chocolates surrounding the Harry Potter Crest, this was such a very impressive personal touch !! and my daughters were thrilled,this showed they cared. A stay to remember,highly recommended."
July 2021,Great escape away from the hustle and bustle,"We stayed for our wedding anniversary and this place was just fantastic in a fantastic part of the city. We were upgraded which was a touch. The staff, rooms, amenities are all top class. Ok it doesn‚Äôt have an on-site carpark but 6 minutes walk away is Q-park which was ¬£55 for 24 hours, but the car is safe and secure and rubbing shoulders with some expensive metal. But overall great place, great location and worth the money "
July 2021,It's ok,"Good location, lovely staff but our room was a little tired looking. Cleaning was ok but for the price I would think it would be absolutely spotless. It's London so I expect limescale but could see it on shower door, stains on chair and tired looking rug which I dared not step on with bare feet.   Lovely terrace bar and lovely staff however. "
September 2021,Wonderful experience,"Very friendly staff, had a lovely time. Wonderful room had a nice view, and a nice surprise bottle of prosecco too.  Only issues were we had to wait an hour extra for the room and the breakfasts didn't come out at the same time."
September 2021,Perfect location,"What a comfortable stay. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. Location was perfect and the staff were extremely hospitable. If there is any hotel I would recommend, it would be this one. Service and food was top class. Will definitely stay here again."
September 2021,Big Birthday Weekend,"Chose the Hari for my 50th Birthday weekend in London based on a first class previous stay last year. The Hari has everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel - the location, the design, the cleanliness etc , but what really makes this place special is the staff. Everyone is so friendly and helpful and nothing is ever a problem. That‚Äôs what lifts the Hari above other hotels. We can‚Äôt wait to return and cannot recommend it highly enough. Stay here - you won‚Äôt regret it."
September 2021,Exceptional,"Stayed at the Hari for a special weekend, from the second the doors open the hotel just gets it right. The team throughout were so genuinely friendly and helpful, the room was amazing and really well thought through and the food was excellent. We cant recommend it highly enough. The location is just a few minutes from Knightsbridge and Sloane Square and it is just the most amazing part of London to walk through. Stay at the Hari is all I can say"
September 2021,Loved every minute of it,"We've stayed several times at The Hari now, and I can assure you it keeps getting better! Alex always knows how to make us feel special, and we absolutely love it!  The bedrooms are magnificent and the hotel stylishly furnished.  We couldn't recommend enough!  Thank you to the whole team and see you soon!"

September 2021,"OUTSTANDING service, great location and beautiful decor","The Hari effortlessly pulled out all the stops to ensure we had the perfect stay during our most recent visit.   After a long day of meetings myself and my business partner checked into The Hari where we were welcomed by Renata who was absolutely brilliant, she made check-in extremely present, asked us all of the right questions had all of the local knowledge, checked in with us to make sure we had dinner plans and made sure we were setup for a perfect stay. Thank you Renata!  We later went to the bar to have a couple of drinks and once again received outstanding service by the team in the garden terrace.  Our room was perfect, clean, with all the amenities we needed, and with a lovely balcony view.   We are already looking forward to our next visit at The Hari."
August 2021,Lockdown Escape,Great to get away for a couple of days and The Hari proved to be an excellent choice.  Located in my favorite part of London and a short walk from amenities and the tube.  We were very well looked after.
August 2021,Luxurious retreat in fantastic location,"We had a fab 2 night stay in this lovely hotel.  The staff are eager to help, full of smiles, offering excellent service at all times.  As soon as you step into the super stylish entrance, an amazing aroma hits you, adding to the welcoming ambiance. The rooms are very well appointed, with super comfortable beds and linens, a an espresso machine and all mod cons. The location is perfect for fabulous shopping, top end restaurants and exploring the beautiful architecture in the immediate vicinity All in all, highly recommended"
June 2021,"Happy to be home at The Hari, again","So happy to have been back - if only for one night this time. Because The Hari is our  home away from home, it feels especially good to arrive even when it is only for one night. thank so much for your lovely 'small' greetings, and the perfect atmosphere. See you soon.‚ù§Ô∏è"
June 2021,Well deserved title holder of UKs No 1 hotel,"Excellent hotel with the friendliest staff mad e for a very pleasant 4 nights.  Good location for walking round Chelsea, Knightsbridge and Belgravia.   Had breakfast in the hotel couple of times which was very nice (no menu available online but good range of choices at reasonable price).  Also dined one evening and the flavours were exquisite! Would definitely recommend this hotel"
June 2021,The hari hotel London,"Had an amazing time as usual  Staff all looked after me and my family amazingly well  Rooms fantastic , clean and good sizes and decor great  Best Location for shopping , sight seeing and good restaurants nearby  All round best hotel in London!!!"
May 2021,Exceptional,"Myself, my colleagues, and some client guests stayed at The Hari on Wednesday 15th September - a group booking of around 20 - all efficiently handled by the Executive Assistant and Reservations Manager Charlie Brown. It was the most exceptional level of customer service I‚Äôve experienced in a long time.   Our group was supremely impressed by the hotel itself, the staff and the thoughtful details the staff - led by Charlie - put in to make our stay both pleasurable and memorable.   We were all blown away by what Charlie had arranged with the pastry chef as she knew the reason for our stay and went the extra mile to leave us all the most delicious and thoughtful edible keepsakes in our rooms. Our clients were most impressed.   We‚Äôve already agreed to book again next year for the‚Ä¶"
June 2021,Best hotel experience of my life,"When I say this hotel is the best hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed in, I mean it. Apart from the stunning terrace, restaurant and bedrooms, the staff that go above and beyond is really what makes this hotel so special. We received an upgrade on arrival and spoke about our plans for the weekend in London as well as poffertjes (it‚Äôll make sense soon).  When we got into the room, we were offered 2 cocktails on the house and shortly after that, received a bottle of champagne along with a personalised cake with my favourite bands logo on it who we were going to see in the o2 that night- completely wowed!  The next morning we ordered breakfast to the room and 3 dishes arrived. You guessed it, the 3rd dish contained poffertjes and a little note to say how we couldn‚Äôt leave without trying them. ‚Ä¶"

June 2021,Lovely boutique hotel,"Nice boutique hotel good location friendly staff.  Pricey but given the area expected. Lovely courtyard bar, good breakfast and bar snacks. Rooms are very comfortable with all the usual treats. We would stay here again although the promised bottle of fizz by the booking agent never materialised."
June 2021,Fantastic hotel with great staff,"We stayed here for two nights. The location is great. You are close to some great bars, restaurants and shopping. The rooms are nicely decorated.

June 2021,Birthday celebrations at a wonderful hotel,"From the moment we walked in to the moment we left, the staff at The Hari were first class. Alex and Dominick in particular were an absolute delight and made our experience at the hotel an incredibly enjoyable one.  Firstly, it's very COVID-safe. Plenty of sanitising stations.   The hotel itself is very boujee and boutique in character but in a lovely rather than pretentious way. The terrace bar is a pretty setting for casual drinks / nibbles and the bar area is a very laid-back speakeasy vibe, which was very enjoyable. The barman (forgot his name apologies!) was very attentive and even brought us a selection of rum tasters given how much I like it.  The rooms are very spacious and comfortable, and because it was a special celebration, the hotel left some treats (both alcoholic‚Ä¶"
July 2021,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed at The Hari for my son‚Äôs 21st birthday party in London. Even though the party was not in the hotel, they got every detail right, upgraded our rooms and even laid on a birthday cake. Despite having to shut during the lockdown, the owners and management have got the property back into tip top condition. The staff are all charming - doesn‚Äôt matter which part of the hotel they work in, they are just friendly, efficient and polite. The rooms are comfortable and bathrooms really well equipped. Overall, I couldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel more - it is certainly on par, if not better than some of its higher priced rivals. Thank you The Hari - a really excellent stay."
June 2021,The Hari- elegant and luxurious,"The hotel was glamorous and stylish and the staff were impeccable. Nothing was too much trouble and our stay was comfortable and chic. We would recommend to anyone visiting the City and would return in a heartbeat. The best night's sleep you can get in London, lovely terrace bar, fantastic food and wonderful staff all made our trip very special."
June 2021,Boutique hotel in a wonderful location,"One of my favourite hotels in London, the location is excellent especially for warmer days when walking is an option.

First of all, the staff were incredibly welcoming and friendly from start to finish. Absolutely everything was perfect. They went above and beyond to make our stay so special. We do normally stay somewhere else but decided to have a change - I'm so glad we did!   The hotel itself is exquisitely designed with a luxurious yet laid back and relaxed style within a great location. The room we stayed in was an absolute dream, beautiful perfectly comfortable and very well equipped.   We had a beautiful meal in the restaurant and again, everything was so perfect. We had eaten at a prestigious restaurant a couple of weeks previously and the food here completely blew that out of the water.  We can't wait to‚Ä¶"
June 2021,New favourite London Hotel,I‚Äôve stayed in many 5 star hotels in London but The Hari is by far the best. The staff are so attentive and nothing is too much trouble for any of them. The location of the hotel is great for shopping. We ate in the hotel restaurant on the Friday evening and both the food and the service were outstanding
May 2021,Fabulous place ,"We had a delightful one-night stay at The Hari. It‚Äôs a beautiful boutique hotel located in the confines of Belgravia.  The staff are very friendly and welcoming on arrival, check in was swift and they kindly upgraded us to a better room. It had been a very wet and miserable day-we must have looked like drowned rats on arrival- and we were pleasantly surprised to hear a knock on the door; they had sent up some complimentary hot chocolates for to warm us up. Much appreciated!  The room was very nice, bed comfy. We had drinks on the terrace which was decorated with flowers and chic lighting.  Overall it‚Äôs a great hotel and we would definitely return. "
June 2021,Loved it - total perfection - booking our return!,"Loved this hotel for many reasons.  Firstly the staff - they treat you like a guest in their home - very welcoming, super friendly, very professional, nothing is too much.  Perfect Belgravia location - especially if you want to go shopping!  Stylish looking interior and very comfy rooms that are very well considered from a practical perspective.  Loved the totally leafy outlook  and quiet location- not what you expect in London.  Great bar/ lounge area with gret menu.  Nice little touches like bikes that you can use,  mini bar in the room rate.   Perfect if you are after a boutique kind of experience - not a large impersonal hotel.  Booking our next stay.  Can't say enough.  THANK YOU!!!!"
June 2021,Such friendly and helpful staff,"A great overnight stay following a wedding reception - the staff were so friendly and helpful - nothing was too much trouble.

June 2021,First Class Best Staff in London,"Visited for an overnight stay for a trip to Wimbledon. First greeting at the door by the staff was so warm and genuinely friendly. Easy check in, again staff were lovely. Left our bags so we could hop off to Sloane Square for a direct tube to Southfields. The concierge even gave us a bottle water for the hot tube journey  This hotel is ideally placed for access to Victoria and Sloane Square each about an easy 10 minute walk through beautiful Belgravia.  The area is quiet but you are minutes away from the hustle and bustle  Arrived back at the hotel about 2230 and bags were in our room which was spacious with a lovely window seat looking out onto a leafy square. There was a hand written note welcoming us and some lovely macaroons   Shower room and separate toilet, very nice‚Ä¶"
May 2021,Best cocktail bar,"An amazing cocktail bar in one of the best hotel in London. Special thanks to Naomi that gave me a welcome with a nice table in the terrace, she‚Äôs always ready for your request. Giuseppe at the bar, as always, made for me the best negroni that I ever taste, every time‚Ä¶ All the staff made me feel home, is always a pleasure. Very recommended"
May 2021,A gem in a prime location in London,My daughter and I stayed in the Hari for 8 nights. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is central and convenient and is very close to Sloane Square and V&A. The room is spacious and clean. The hotel is very well setup for all the Covid measures and it makes us feel very safe. We will definitely go back. 
May 2021,Perfect Stay,"My wife and I stayed at the Hari London this past weekend to celebrate my wifes birthday. From the moment we arrived to the minute we left we were really looked after and treated so well. Each member of staff that we came across had a 5 star customer service level. I had requested a cake and flowers for my wifes birthday, I have to say that the cake was extremely delicious and the flowers were the best she has ever received. Our room was perfect and the Terrace bar was an amazing place to enjoy some pre dinner drinks. Each request we had was catered for without without seconds thought. It's a shame we were only there for the one night but we will definitely be returning for another stay in the near future. Thank you again to the Hari for making us feel so welcome!"
May 2021,Simply the best  ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,"Need to start this review off by saying how fussy I usually am.. I go to 5 stars in Mexico and ask to see the honeymoon suite when it‚Äôs not even my honeymoon that‚Äôs how extreme I am. I‚Äôm not easily pleased but what I can say is this hotels staff are EXCEPTIONAL. Nothing , is a problem.   The concierge (forgot his name but he give us a card) has everything under control. He‚Äôs fire and completely on the ball. The reception staff are chilled but professional, they don‚Äôt make you feel like you are being judged they are really down to earth while doing a great job. Highly professional.   The guys in the bar and restraint, are the same. Neither English but both speak fluent.

Room was beautiful and state of the art! Will definitely be staying there again!  Highly recommend! "
May 2021,"Just the best! Food, Staff & Stay!","The most amazing stay at the Hari - the staff are super friendly and couldn't do enough for us. If you're looking for an event space, their private dining room is amazing and their in house florist makes the most incredible bouquets. The food is easily 5 star and more! Never fails to impress, would always recommend to people looking for an luxury, yet relaxed stay in a lovely part of London."
April 2021,Had the MOST amazing time - could not recommend The Hari Hotel enough,Stayed for one night for a friends 30th birthday and had dinner in the Private Dining Room. The team at The Hari went out of their way to make it the most special occasion. Service and food were outstanding!! Rooms are beautiful and a great size with stunning views of Belgravia!!  Fantastic location for shopping and restaurants!  Will definitely be back soon!!!
May 2021,Once in a lifetime stay,"I am not someone who usually leaves a review. However, Andrew and the team made our time such a memorial experience that I thought this was essential. Matthew and Alex went above and beyond the duty of care, with their service and made my fianc√©e‚Äôs birthday, the best memory ever.  We cannot wait to come back here as soon as we can. Simon Taylor"
May 2021,Best stay for our wedding night,"Had an absolutely brilliant time at The Hari over the weekend! We stayed our wedding night in the hotel, and also celebrated our big day with friends at the Amalfi Terrace. The room had spectacular views of London, while the terrace had a very cosy and aesthetic vibe. The staff were very helpful and allowed us to stay at the terrace beyond operating hours to celebrate our big day. They really went out of their way to provide amazing service I cannot ask for a better experience. Will definitely be returning back for another fun night üòÅ"

The Head Concierge, Ben Malpass, and Diego were extremely responsive and helpful on a number of occasions and under special circumstances.

May 2021,Stands out from the crowd,"Had an exceptional stay at The Hari.  Whilst I had high expectations from a 5 star hotel my expectations were surpassed.  The staff were exceptional, so friendly and go above and beyond for their guests.  Whilst you would expect this from a 5 star hotel, I was taken aback by the warmth, friendliness and I have to say the sincerity of the staff.  The hotel itself also reflects this with lots of lovely intimate seating areas making it feel warm and  welcoming, but modern and very chic. If you are looking for a truly unique hotel stay for whatever the occasion then you‚Äôve got to try The Hari. Needless to say, I will definitely be coming back."
May 2021,Very welcoming and safe,Booked The Hari for a business trip and was greeted by a exceptionally friendly team who were very accommodating.

The staff instantly transform into friends; all incredibly welcoming and genuinely attentive . We stayed in the stunning Studio Suite overlooking the leafy park which cannot be faulted and being welcomed with a personalised amenity was such a lovely surprise. Cannot rate this hotel enough - the people, the ambience and the beautiful terrace - The Hari should be everyone's first port of call to escape their homes after the last year! Thanks to all xx"
April 2021,The best hotel I‚Äôve ever been to,"We stayed at the Hari for my 50th birthday and I was so overwhelmed by the amazing service and kindness shown by all the staff. Everyone went over and above to make my birthday stay a very special one. We were given a very warm welcome when we arrived and I was wished a happy birthday. We were given a room upgrade and shown around the hotel. Our car was parked and cases brought to our room. We went shopping and were given an umbrella on our way out as the sky looked at bit dark.  When we returned there was a big balloon in my room, my favourite drink and a card which was such an amazing touch. We then went for dinner and again my birthday was acknowledged by the lovely staff and the food and service was first class in so many ways. The room was beautiful and very comfortable. I‚Ä¶"

The room had a lookout to trees and a kind of indoor balcony. We loved the area with lots of cafes, shops and parks. Staff and concierge took great care of us."
October 2020,A stylish oasis in a beautiful location.,"Stayed at The Hari for one night in May. With hospitality reopening securing good restaurant bookings was incredibly difficult, fortunately the Concierge desk, and Ben in particular absolutely excelled we got great lunch and dinner bookings and were kept appraised at every stage- even being offered options.  Indeed, we were extremely well looked after by the whole team.  The room was beautifully decorated with a light, spacious feel and bright open views on two sides.   The location is perfect for our trip (shopping!) prices are reasonable and the hotel represents extremely good value. Facilities are reopening in spite of the challenges presented by COVID amongst others things.  I can say that the COVID measures in place allow you to enjoy your stay feeling safe and relaxed.

October 2020,Beautiful terrace at The Hari,"A few friends & I were looking for somewhere to have some drinks & a bite to eat to celebrate the easing of lockdown and catch up after a year of not seeing one another, and stumbled across The Hari‚Äôs terrace having seen it advertised on a few Instagram pages.   From booking the table, to leaving the hotel - the staff were always attentive and keen to make the visit special - and it really was.   We had the most fantastic night, the service was brilliant and quick, the food was delicious (The Hari Club was a particular favourite, but the truffle chips were equally devine !) and unlike many other places I‚Äôve seen - it was well heated and ventilated - so we felt safe & warm.   We‚Äôll definitely be back!  "
October 2020,A Hidden Gem,"We were recommended this hotel as we needed to be within walking distance of Knightsbridge. The Hari is a hidden gem that oozes charm and style whilst embracing the very essence of British hospitality. This is a very chic boutique hotel with service to match. Rooms are well appointed and very comfortable and importantly for central London it was very peaceful enabling a perfect night's sleep. Breakfast was perfect and our waitress from Argentina (Maria I think?) couldn't do enough for us. The reception team were really sincere in their welcome and genuinely appreciated our custom, we will certainly return and can't recommend highly enough."
October 2020,Perfect hotel in central London,Now our go to hotel in London - feels like a home from home. Very warm welcome and the warmth and quality doesn‚Äôt deteriorate throughout the stay. Have stated a couple of times in recent months. Difficult to fault any aspect of the rooms and overall ambience. Thank you to the team for another great stay. Here‚Äôs to a less turbulent 21 for hoteliers.
October 2020,Great hotel with fantastic Staff,We stayed at the hotel with friends whilst we visited London. The hotel was fantastically clean and the staff were brilliant. We spent a great night in the bar drinking and enjoying some of the bar food. The only negative I took away from staying was the lack of milk in the room to make a coffee however the room service was phenomenal and quickly delivered those much needed morning coffee
October 2020,Uk,"I stayed in the hari for the first time and I am sure it won‚Äôt be the last , I really enjoyed every single thing in this place , lobby area is cosy, bar is just a cool place to have my cigar, and the rooms are fabulous. I really love the location which is close to everywhere I have to go in my weekend. Special thanks to Sabrine in front desk who welcomed us with a warm smile offered a very nice complimentary room upgrade and always checking if we are happy. Thanks to the hari team and see you soon."
October 2020,A slice of paradise!,"Upon arrival we we're greeted and escourted inside. After a breif encounter, myself and my partner headed inside to escape the typical British weather, where we were greeted by drinks arranged prior. Fabulous decor and sense of hospitality by this point was already something i'd had yet to experience, after a decade of living in london! I was sipping my drink and completely forgot about our luggage, lo and behold, the porter had already taken them to our room!   The staff were helpful to say the least, and best of all, genuinely friendly and hospitable.   The room to say it was good would be an understatement, it was great. The views of London from the room we were in was spectacular, and a fridge with some gin topped off the evening.   I cant reccomend a better value, opulent‚Ä¶"
March 2020,A wonderful stay,"My husband and I stayed at The Hari on the 24th October. A wonderful hotel, fabulous room, and the most attentive staff we have ever met.  Honestly we felt like VIPs.  We ate dinner in Il Pampero and it was simply delicious   as was breakfast - it was so hard to choose from all of the options.  To sum up, the hotel was just WOW"
March 2020,Excellence all round,"Even before I left Australia Dominick the customer service manager was in contact to make sure I would have all I preferred in my room on arrival. I was pleasantly surprised my room was ready upon early 6am arrival. Such a relief. The room was extremely comfortable with a lovely outlook and room to unpack . The staff at the hotel are extremely friendly, generous and certainly make sure you are well looked after. Such a pleasant change from a 5 star chain hotel. The bar and terrace area are unique and comfortable and was easy being a solo traveller to sit in a quiet area. The food offerings were delicious and breakfast off a very high standard. I really can‚Äôt thank the staff enough for catering to my needs and making me feel special. Taking the time to have a chat and making sure‚Ä¶"
February 2020,Absolutely stunning,"I was blown away by the entire experience at The Hari.  The team of staff were exceptional, interior was lush and rooms were so luxurious.

February 2020,Excellent service and great location,A wonderful hotel with excellent and friendly staff. I stayed in room 603 and everything was perfect and the bed is incredibly comfortable. Most hotels at this price point have similar amenities but the true difference between all hotels is the staff. At the Hari the staff couldn't be more welcoming and professional and made me feel at home. I will stay again on my next trip to London and recommend the same to friends and family. Well done!
February 2020,Service second to non,"We chose the Hari for a recent staycation based on the reviews and the fact that the price point was a little more reasonable than some of the '5 star' London hotels. The stand out thing about this hotel is the service, which goes way beyond the extra mile, nothing was too much trouble, from getting our preferred morning papers  to arranging a massage at short notice. It is not a grand old building but the common areas have been decorated with taste and flair and are very comfy.  The only downside to our mind was the fact that the rooms were on the small side."
February 2020,Great Wedding Base,A great hotel with excellent staff. We used it as a base for my son‚Äôs wedding and the hotel staff couldn‚Äôt do enough to help it run smoothly. We spent a pleasant afternoon in the bar area and enjoyed some excellent Margaritas.
February 2020,Excellent experience,"A superb luxury hotel situated in central London with an extraordinary staff approach and very high standard of service. I can not recommend more this place as it made me feel so safe on all my stay!!! I really enjoyed the lounge area and the outdoor terrace, especially in this particularly times. Looking forward visiting again this place which made me feel like home!!!"
February 2020,Fantastic comfy beds,"It‚Äôs  nerve wracking staying in a hotel during this pandemic, but we were made to feel extremely secure and pampered at the Hari hotel this weekend.  My sister and I stayed in adjoining rooms 501 and 502, the beds were so comfortable with lightweight duvets and perfect pillows,  once we discovered the TV channels and all the films it was hard to leave the room and the complimentary chilled Soave, but we went to the cocktail bar where we were fortunate to meet Andrew Coney the general manager who was extremely convivial and suggested a couple of cocktails,   I can recommend the  espresso martini, cranberry sour and negroni. we also had of truffle chips, salted squid, tempura vegetables and chicken satay. Then when we got back to our rooms we discovered doughnut balls with salted‚Ä¶"

The asset is ""NYC within the heart of London"". Keep it up - see you next time around. "

March 2020,"Great People, Attentive & Friendly Service, Great Location","Rooms are very clean, with thoughtful amenities and extras. The staff are very friendly and appear to be caring and thoughtful. All are very helpful and polite.  They also appear to be genuine and non-scripted, which is very nice and sometimes hard to find in high-end luxury hotels."
December 2019,The kindest people ever,"I have stayed in many hotels all over the world and never encountered such kind and gentle staff. Starting from reservation to reception to all who were in service. They never said no to any of our requests, accommodating and warm the staff were always there to answer any request or question. Breakfast is of excellent choices and was lucky to have dinner at their Italian restaurant. Rooms are relatively small and in particular the toilet yet it is compensated with excellent service.

Also arrived to a lovely treat in the room for the occasion we were in London for! Really personal touch. Thanks again all at the Hari"
July 2019,Hidden Gem,"An elegant boutique hotel hidden away in central Belgravia tripping distance to Harvey Nics & Harrods. Provides luxury,  the personal touch and nothing is to much trouble for them . If they havn‚Äôt already thought about it they will ask and you will receive warmly. From the mixologist, concierge,  arranged personally via email from Dominick the manager who contacted me prior to my stay and the chef who prepared my individual dinner catering for my allergy.  The bar and Garden terrace are perfect to relax with friends, meet people , romantic and it has that   Soho House vibe. I can‚Äôt wait to go there again soon. You must  try the cocktail Jules they named it after me, you will love it."
August 2019,Exceptional service at the hotel,"We stayed the first night of the hotel reopening post COVID closure. It was our wedding night and all the staff at the hotel were amazing. The room was beautiful with great views, facilities were brilliant. It‚Äôs the perfect location to explore London from. But it was the service that set this hotel apart from the rest. The staff could not do enough to make our stay special, especially Dominic. I cannot recommend The Hari enough. "
July 2019,Cheeky luxury weekend break in London,"Decided to take the family to London for a post-COVID lockdown weekend break. We wanted something a bit special (Wedding Anniversary) so picked the Hari.  The hotel has special measures in place to keep visitors safe, such as cleaning regime and staff wearing masks.  The staff welcome from the front door onwards is brilliant. Every member of staff greets you in a genuinely warm way, always making sure you are being served and happy... every time you see them.  The rooms were fantastic (1 very big king, 1 twin) with views over the park. Very clean with every possible item a traveller might require in the room. Despite being near the road there is no noticeable traffic sound, so sitting in the window seat in our room watching the world go by was incredibly relaxing.  We dined in‚Ä¶"

As is always the case, the stay did not disappoint, the staff were extremely attentive, the bar as always was great and overall this hotel does feel like home.   The rooms are extremely comfortable and we thoroughly enjoyed the delicious complimentary cookies waiting for us and appreciated the great mask/hand sanitizer kit.

July 2019,Design hotel with lovely staff,Really arty design hotel in Direct proximity to Knightsbridge. The whole staff was very friendly and felt genuine in their concern towards my comfort during my stay. Alex at the reception was really warm and welcoming and showed me how the features in my room.

The staff is always very attentive, the reception service is amazing (Carlo was, as always, a great host when I arrived and when I checked out!) and the entire crew is always making me feel special. It is not just about the great service, it is about consistency and feeling part of a team that enjoys hosting you at their home. Great job, team The Hari!"
December 2019,Boutique quality,Loved this hotel. A real gem in the middle of Knightsbridge with a great bar and restaurant.  Great rooms beautifully presented but a little on the small side. Staff really personal and knowledgable of the area.
November 2019,Nice boutique hotel in a great location,"I stayed at The Hari with my daughter in July 2019. This was a repeat visit for me as I had stayed there before and loved the hotel and the great location. On check in there was an issue with the room thats was given to me, and the hotel staff resolved it to my satisfaction. I thus wanted to give a note of thanks to both Eleonara at the front desk and her manager Renata for solving the problem. It was this attitude and resolution that made my stay totally comfortable and satisfactory. Rooms are a bit on the smallish side, but not too small as to be uncomfortable. All the room and toilet facilities are great and there is a turndown service every night with some amazing chocolates left on the pillow.  I also need to thank Violetta from the Concierge service who found me tickets to‚Ä¶"

November 2019,The bar  in hari hotel ,From the best bars and hotel in London and the waiters was very friendly and helpful and the food was very delicious specially the pasta and the burgers and from the dessert the donuts I really had a great time 
November 2019,A friend and I spent 11 wonderful days in the care of all the lovely staff at the Hari Hotel London.,We were so impressed with the attention to detail and the friendly helpful staff at the Hari Hotel London.  We will be returning soon!  We have travelled the world and this hotel is at the top of our list.  What a wonderful way to start and end each day!

December 2018,Excellent boutique hotel in Belgravia,"Excellent boutique hotel in Belgravia.  Hotel is ideally situated in Belgravia with easy access to many stores and offices. The hotel bedrooms were very comfortable and the staff were accommodating.  We enjoyed the morning breakfast buffet and the bar located on the second floor was convenient.  If traveling for business in London and you need to be in Belgravia or nearby areas of Knightsbridge,  Chelsea or around Hyde Park, then I recommend this hotel."
October 2019,beatiful hotel,The hari hotel is one of my favourite in london. The rooms are modern and elegant. The service is good and receptive. Ours was a bit noisy because the Windows needed some further sealing but that will be dealt with by the hotel.   Prices are ok considering the quality of the hotel and the service.  Location is pretty convenient as well.
November 2019,Very nice hotel," I am coming from Hong Kong  with my family , and I choose to come back again ,All the staff there are so nice and friendly , and specially Subine is very helpful and offer a tea for me with their lovely  biscuit"
November 2019,"Excellent Hotel, Excellent Location","We wanted a hotel where we could easily walk to many things and The Hari is perfectly located for that. Approx 15-20 minute walk to Buckingham Palace. As others have mentioned its easy access to Harrods and other sights. Excellent, helpful staff ensuring a welcome every time we returned from our travels. Belgravia is a lovely suburb with elegant buildings and very quiet. After spending our days walking, we didn‚Äôt want to venture too far for dinner. We ate at the hotel (very nice) and found a couple of pubs and restaurants within a reasonable distance of the hotel."
June 2019,"If not home, then a close second","Staff is warm, polite, professional, and helpful, without being pompous or fake - they are genuine hoteliers. Chef is exceptional :) Location is excellent. Rooms are comfortable and well appointed. I really like the fact that the bar/lounge area is upstairs, and hence separated from the lobby area downstairs.  It creates more intimacy and cosiness. And of course, saving the best for last: the Secret Garden! As a cigar aficionada, the small but beautiful cigar terrasse was the main reason I booked this hotel the first time, and why I also keep coming back. Thank you great Hari Team!"

June 2019,Fantastic Service in London,"My husband and I spent our 20th wedding anniversary at The Hari. We chose it for all of the 5 star reviews on-line and the location. We were not disappointed. From the moment we arrived to the minute we walked out the door to leave the service was impeccable. The staff helped us arrange tours and pre-pay, guided us on what Tube lines to take and made suggestions on where to eat. Il Pampero was out of the this world both nights we had dinner there. This hotel made us feel special every step of the way. We ended each night with a small bite of chocolate or whatever candy they left by our bed. We definitely plan to return and will definitely stay at The Hari."
May 2019,Excellent Hotel,I was extremely blown away by the incredible service at The Hari. Not only is it beautiful hotel in a great neighborhood but the staff went above and beyond to make sure all our needs were met. Can‚Äôt wait to come back here.

The hotel had bikes for the visitors and when we call for a room service it don‚Äôt take 4 minutes,so that‚Äôs why it is the best service,the best hotel tourist."
March 2019,An Unforgettable experience in the best area of London,"We visited the hari the previous month for 4 nights.From the day of check-in to the day of departure everything went more than perfect.We had an amazing cozy and beautiful room facing the park, the  sofa net to the window  was the best spot for me and my wife to enjoy our coffee, we absolutely loved it. The staff was very warm and welcoming and they were always willing to help us. The hotel  is located in belgravia a quiet and very beautiful area which is just a few minutes walk  from the tube station and for me personal the best place for shopping,  Harrods. I am sure that I have found my new spot in London.Can't wait to be back."
May 2019,A warm welcome,I couldn‚Äôt find another warm place like the unique hotel. The stuff is very well trained to help in all ways. I even were surprised that they offer free mobile to take. That is called a royal treat. Just the thing I need.
June 2019,weekend at the Hari,"we had a very relaxing weekend at the Hari and spent a nice weekend in London with family and friends. room was very nice, but a bit on the small side and the icon can sometimes make  the atmosphere quite dry."
May 2019,Amazing Stay at the Hari,"I had an amazing 1 night stay at the Hari- I wished it were longer!  The staff was so accommodating, the room was beautiful and the location was perfect.  Prior to our stay I reached out for afternoon tea and dining recommendations.  They booked a few for us to give options so that we wouldn‚Äôt miss out as weekends get busy.  It turned out that they made reservations for us at two of the most famous places in London and we were lucky to get reservations as both places usually have a waiting list!  We also shared with the hotel that we were celebrating our recent engagement and they went above and beyond to celebrate with us.   I will be back and definitely recommend! "
December 2018,Tasteful stopover,"Couldn‚Äôt ask for more, good service from arrival throughout, Rooms nice and tasteful , simple electrics and no stupid gimmicks, good bar and food also, overall excellent in a very nice part of london and a new favourite for trips "
May 2019,Flawless from start to finish.,"My husband booked a night at The Hari for us to celebrate both my birthday and our first wedding anniversary. We've always been fans of sourcing boutique hotels over your well-known chain brands and The Hari didn't disappoint.   A hidden gem in the heart of Belgravia, a stones through away from the iconic Harrods and boasting top floor views over the City of London which is a spectacle to see at sunset.   We arrived early, prepared to leave our bags for a later check-in, however, our room was ready for us. Not the room we had initially booked though, instead The Hari, very kindly, upgraded us to their exquisite Penthouse suite for us to enjoy our double-celebration weekend in style. We were shown to our suite and advised that should we need anything during our stay, the‚Ä¶"
May 2019,Excellent Staff at The Hari,"The Hari staff was the best part of  our stay.  Everyone went out of their way to make sure we had everything we required. Everyone was pleasant, respectful  and eager to assist.  I have stayed at grander, more luxurious hotels before but I have never had better service.  Special thanks goes to the front desk staff, the concierges and the bellmen.  They were excellent ambassadors for The Hari. For this reason, I will highly recommend The Hari to friends and colleagues traveling to London."
May 2019,Mr L,"Wonderful hotel, wonderful location, superbly friendly staff. Pure 5* plus hotel that provides a unique individual experience.  As soon as you enter the Hari you are welcomed by knowledgeable staff and incredible decor of a stunning hotel."
May 2019,wonderful hotel choice for London,this hotel was truly one of the best we have ever stayed in and we have traveled  on 6 continents The room was clean the bedding was excellent but the best part was the hotel services and the staff They were OUTSTANDING
May 2019,The Hari Hotel will be our first choice for accommodation in London!,The staff were so friendly and helpful in every way possible. We had not stayed at the Hari previously and were not sure what to expect. They did not disappoint and provided us with the best stay we could have imagined.
May 2019,"LOVE LOVE LOVE! Your need to stay here, what a gem!","This hotel has been one of my most absolute favorite hotels that I have had the pleasure of staying in.  It's chic, a gem to find, and it the lovely area of Belgravia. The area of Belgravia is so gorgeous and the hotel is beautiful and the people that work there are lovely.   I stayed here on the weekend when I arrived from travelling from Australia for what seemed to be around 40+ hour of travelling. My friend and I were greeted with fresh lychee juice, a wonderful concierge and check-in staff. They provided us with bicycles where in a short 5 minutes we had already ridden to around Hyde Park. The area was very safe at night and the architecture of the surrounding buildings was stunning.   We loved the street nearby recommended by the doorman where we got fresh pastries and‚Ä¶"
May 2019,Excellent Hotel & Service,"We stayed only for one night and wished we had booked for longer. The service was outstanding, and by far the best place we have stayed in London. Very comfy rooms and the attention to detail was appreciated! Our son just loved his sofa bed with the TV in front of him. Definitely will stay again when in London."
May 2019,Gorgeous boutique hotel,"Loved everything about The Hari, from the men that help you out of the taxi and with your bags to the reception staff, the housekeeping really helpful and the waiters and waitresses so very patient and helpful. Thank you all we will be back! "
April 2019,Great Customer Service & Quiet Rooms,Terrific front desk crew and concierge.  Larger rooms than average for downtown London.  In quiet neighborhood of Belgravia/Mayfair.  10 minute walk to the subway.  Easy location to get Ubers or taxis.  Big TV was impressive in the room.  Nice bar and terrace area.
April 2019,"Great location, small room, nice overall","We stayed at The Hari for a few days, and the location is great, just a 5 minute walk to Harrods, and the other shops and attractions that are nearby. The room was small, with just enough room for the bed, but nothing else. The view from the room was non-existent, just another building. I wanted to like The Hari, and although the hotel was quaint, clean, and nice enough, it did not meet my expectations based on cost and location, which made me expect more. I suppose that this is one of the issues with smaller, independent boutique hotels, where it is hard to predict what one will get. I will look for a different hotel on my next trip to London."
April 2019,The perfect spot for three days in London,"I just had a wonderful three night stay at The Hari and cannot wait for my next visit.  Our room was large with a great park view.  The location is perfect for shopping at Harrods or Harvey Nichols, a coffee in Chelsea or a late night snack at EL&M.  The staff was incredibly nice and helpful and kind as could be. We loved the garden terrace for a drink and snacks as well."
April 2019,Classy all the way including the people.,"We loved it. Enthusiastic and laid-back people at the same time. Fresh in every day. Super comfortable common areas. Good-sized rooms. Black-out curtains. Zero noise from the street. Terrific, authentic Italian restaurant with full Italian staff. Eat fish. Salt encrusted. Eat salad. Any salad. "
April 2019,Wow! Worlds apart from other top hotels ,"Where do I begin? I absolutely loved my stay at The Hari and cant compliment them enough on outstanding service, attention to detail, personal touches and overall plush, stylish surroundings.  I was visiting London on Business to attend a premiere at the Saatchi gallery and had media traveling with me. The hotel and the team on the front desk couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful or welcoming. From the moment we arrived we were greeted with big smiles and a helpful manner. Our bags were whipped off us and when they were delivered to our room, the very kind gentleman showed us how to work everything. Yes, there are things to learn! üòÑ in the room there was a handy roaming mobile that you could carry out with you to have access to the internet and make calls for free as well as‚Ä¶"
April 2019,Wonderful stay at the Hari Hotel,"Staff were friendly and attentive. The room was quiet and clean.  Turn down snacks and bottled water were a nice touch.  The bathroom was quite small but ok.  We found the push switches for the lights to be a bit annoying as you often had to push them several times to work.  We used the complimentary Handy portable device however a mobile hot spot might have been more useful.  I think you have the option to use the Handy device as a Hot Spot for a daily fee.  The Hari is in a very nice area, fairly close to bus stops and tube stations."
April 2019,Sheer Perfection ,"What can you say other than I seriously upset it was one night only!  From arrival to room this is a blissful experience, peaceful location and a flawless check in and front to house....such a perfect experience having flown in the day before for meeting and flying the next day.  Staff were excellent and helpful, and a great reception that was more spacious by design than anything else.  Room superb, brilliant bathroom and excellent shower.  Really powerful rain shower.....a rarity.  Bed was incredibly comfy and a real fight to leave it the next day, the room was spacious and had a superb window sofa that had amazing views...such a great room, if you had time and a book this was the place to be.  The hotel bar was great, superb cocktails and snacks and a great roof terrace. ‚Ä¶"
April 2019,Fabulous ,"We stayed for 6 nights. Hotel is beautiful. Staff are outstanding. Rooms are immaculate. Location is excellent ‚Äî 5 minute walk from Hyde Park, 10 walk to Buckingham Palace, 15 walk to Trafalgar, 10 walk to South Kensington. Definitely would stay again. "
April 2019,Perfection,"What a fantastic 1 night stay at The Hari. From the moment we arrived, the service was excellent. Thank you for some lovely touches in the room as we celebrated our wedding anniversary. Oh, and what comfortable beds!!! A hotel definitely looking out for its guests & we will be sure to return.  "
April 2019,Great experience ,"My wife and I went for our 5th anniversary and staying at The Hari was a great decision. We loved the location, the design of the room, the friendliness of the staff (specially Ivan at the front desk and Violetta in the concierge), etc  We would definitely go back to Hari in our next visit to London vs staying in the traditional huge 5 star hotels.   Thanks Hari staff and looking forward to see you soon. "
May 2019,Sofisticated London Hotelüåü,My husband and I stayed 4 nights at this wonderful hotel in beautiful Belgravia. Close to Sloane Square and Harrods. We agreed it was the best service and ambience.  The room we had on the 8 floor had a great London city view.  We will absolutely come back to this sofisticated hotel. 
May 2019,Great Belgravia location and surprising space,"My wife and I had a lovely Easter weekend stay here. The hotel was new to us, but we loved the decor and the friendly staff on arrival. We found the single most impressive aspect of the hotel was easily the size of the rooms. For this location and pricing, the rooms were a great size, with lovely, well laid bathrooms, great amenities in room, and also for our room, a small balcony with rooftop views of London. This was very special and was certainly quite different to other hotels in the area. The Easter egg on arrival from Guest Relations was an awesome personal touch that wasn't even thought of. That's the mark of a well staffed hotel that puts surprising and delighting at the forefront.  Il Pampero was great for breakfast (definitely try one of the Eggs Benedict style‚Ä¶"
May 2019,Weekend in London,"I‚Äôm a usual client of this amazing Hitel , I like the mood , the quality and the location of the Hotel . Staff is incredibly kind and friendly , the rooms are not big but very well curated . The food is good and the bath products are of high quality . For sure it‚Äôs my Hotel in London ! "
May 2019,Comfort and Service in Belgravia,"With a great location for shopping and dining, The Hari is quietly tucked into Belgravia. Hotel service is excellent as is the restaurant, Il Pampero: try the salt-baked fish. The cozy rooms have very comfortable beds however, there is little room for other than sleeping; the Lounge on the first floor offers space to read and have a quiet cup of tea. "
May 2019,"A great place to stay in Belgravia, London","This hotel was welcoming from the beginning the staff was great, the room very comfortable, the bathroom products were awesome and it was so nice to have a surprise treat in the room every evening. I would definitely stay again in this hotel."
May 2019,"Cozy, boutique in great locstion","Friendly staff, cozy accommodations, great location, comfortable rooms with nice views and much more! I will definitely be coming back.  Centric location, quiet neighborhood but close to nice shops and good restaurants."
May 2019,A true gem in the heart of Knightsbridge ,"Wow. Second visit to The Hari this year for work and I am incredible impressed. Property is a true gem, a lot of attention to design and details. Rooms are large, comfortable with big windows (cute window seating area on my first visit and a open view of London from the ninth floor on my second one). Love the location in the heart of Knightsbridge, nice walk to Mayfair for meetings, close by to fantastic dining options and friends in Chelsea/South Kensington and just 5min to Harrods for last minute shopping. The staff is just delightful and goes out of their way to take care of you. They remembered my recent stay and had a variety of warm attentions which were noticed and appreciated. Will definitely come back!  I come to London about 8/10x per year for work. "
April 2019,Excellent in all aspects,This was our second stay at the Hari which turned out to be just excellent. The staff were very welcoming and helpful. They provided quality service while demonstrating professionalism throughout the stay. The food at the restaurant during dinner was very good following the suggestions of the ma√Ætre d'h√¥te and the breakfast delicious. The personal touch added comfort and warmth to the stay. Overall excellent.
May 2019,Great stay :):):),"We came at the Hari Hotel with my wife just for a few days and our stay was amazing! Totally relaxing, with a modern design and a homey atmosphere!  Restaurant Il Pampero was a beautiful spot for dinner with delicious food and lovely deserts! :)"
April 2019,That would be my new home hotel,"It was a very quick decision taken to have a nice escapade to london and i was so happy to land in such a fabulous hotel. A nice cosy modern fabulously well located nicely priced hotel. The room was small but we were lucky to be on the 10th floor and so the view was fabulous. The staff is very friendly. The room service is so quick.  They‚Äôve left us a mobile phone in the room to use for all phone calls local and international, internet etc.. so no need to get a uk number. That was really a fascinating idea, it was definitely very useful. I am so excited to visit london again and again as i have a new home there now."
October 2018,Belgravia‚Äôs hidden Beauty*,"A hotel with exceptional service, exceptional quality and luxurious rooms. Travelled here on my own for overnite stay before moving on to Cologne but this is the memory I wont forgot. They graciously accommodated a 6am very early check in after long flight from Australia. The room was immaculate and spacious. The bathroom a dream. I will be back in the future with my wife and three children when we are next in town. My chosen new ‚Äúhome‚Äù for London holidays and fun. Thank you Hari. BTW...the Italian restaurant was A1."
February 2019,Amazing stay,"We came for the weekend and we were welcome by an amazing team. Everything was very relaxing and easy, we loved the atmosphere. The bar and restaurant are fantastic. We wished we could have stayed longer !"
February 2019,Authentic Italian restaurant.,"I‚Äôve been to the Hari for dinner at Il Pampero with my partner‚Äôs family. Let‚Äôs start by saying that the restaurant is absolutely lovely, very cozy and beautifully designed. The food is extremely tasty, very well presented and the service it‚Äôs one of the most attentive I‚Äôve ever experienced; very recommended for a proper Italian meal in London. Can‚Äôt to wait to be back!"
February 2019,Favourite London hotel,"As an ex Londoner, I am very particular about where I stay when I come to visit. I love the location of The Hari: situated on one of the quieter side streets of Belgravia but within walking distance of Knightsbridge, Sloane Square, and South Kensington, it is perfectly located.  The hotel is extremely handsome, with beautiful urban decor which reminds me of some of the better boutique hotels in New York, and the rooms, whilst small, have a lovely comfortable feel without being stuffy (not a whiff of chintz here thankfully!) The service was impeccable, I stayed just under a week and was made to feel totally at home by everyone working here. I highly recommend the restaurant: whilst the Maitre D' is a little aloof, the food is delicious and the people watching is worth it."
February 2019,Simply The Best,We travel a lot worldwide and always strive for the best hotel experience. The Hari was recommended to us by a very experienced senior hotel executive who clearly knows his hotel business. We loved every moment of our brief stay. The staff couldn‚Äôt be more friendly and attentive. The accommodations were charming and comfortable. The food at the restaurant was superb. We will remain grateful for the experience and we will make The Hari our first choice of a hotel for all of our future visits to London. 
February 2019,Our Only Place to Stay in London,"This is our 3rd visit to The Hari and we love it here. It‚Äôs located in a quiet neighborhood but still walkable to major attractions, restaurants or underground stations. The staff is exceptionally friendly and always welcome you back inquiring about your day‚Äôs adventure. They gave us some great advice on how to get to one of the less visited attractions so that we would have good views of the city. The rooms are very nice with all the amenities you expect plus. We enjoy stopping in at the bar for a drink after a long day out. The breakfast buffet is very lovely. We didn‚Äôt eat dinner there (as we have our favorites in the area that we walk to) but I‚Äôve heard that it‚Äôs the best Italian restaurant! "
February 2019,Mother‚Äôs Day Weekend Gone Bad,"I stayed here during Mother‚Äôs Day weekend. I selected the hotel based on reviews and 5 star hotel. So I expected exceptional service. I was surprised of how low the ceilings were however I will say do not order room service. The first night we were jet lagged so ordered room service. The hotel charges you for the serving tray to bring the food to you which converts to $5.72 USD each tray. I‚Äôve never stayed at any 5-star hotel that does this. The next night I stayed at the hotel in the evening as my family went out. My family dropped something off at the hotel to take to front desk but the bell man said he would take upstairs. I heard one knock at the door and as I was getting out of bed to see who it was, my door was opened. It was the bell man. I‚Äôve never stayed at a hotel‚Ä¶"
March 2018,The Hari is a must-stay in London!,"The Hari is a fantastic boutique property in Mayfair. It really feels like you're visiting a quiet, off the beaten path part of the city in a local neighbourhood. The rooms with the tub with the large windows makes for a unique view of the city."
February 2019,What a gem!,"The Hari delivers on all counts.  Perfect location for exploring London, delicious food at Il Pampero, very comfortable rooms -  ours had an amazing view over Chesham Place gardens - the friendliest and most helpful staff and .... it smells so good!!!!  The terrace is fabulous in all it‚Äôs floral glory and the lounge/bar area just the right place for an early evening Bellini!  Our only regret was not staying for longer.  We hope to be back again soon."
February 2019,"Gorgeous Hotel, Exceptional Service, Great Location","This hotel is simply stunning. It had a perfect mix of old-world charm and modern style. The restaurant is gorgeous and the food and drinks were sublime. The location makes it easy to explore London. However, what made our experience truly exceptional was the staff--they provided superlative service on par with hotels that are 2-3 times the price. While this hotel is not inexpensive, I felt that we got fantastic value for our dollar here. Would happily stay again and would highly recommend it to others. My only (tiny) issue is that the rooms don't have a lot of overhead lighting so when getting ready at night it was a bit dark in the room. During the day, the beautiful windows let in tons of natural light. Overall, an exceptional experience. "
December 2018,I love this place!,"This is an amazing hotel. Excellent rooms, super comfy beds, and friendly and amenable staff.Whats more the location could not be better. One of my favourites. Not cheap - but this is Knightsbridge!  I was given a complementary bottle of champagne on my last visit - but I cannot recall why. Anyhow I was flying the following morning, so it is on ice awaiting my next visit.  Quite informal for a 5 star hotel, but that suits me perfectly. Bar and restaurant fabulous, very easy to strike up conversations with staff and other guests, just to make you feel more at home. "
February 2019,Two night stay,"Staff very efficient and friendly,  Rooms were very comfortable &!well equipped.  We dined in te restaurant & had a very nice meal . Again the staff were very attentive but discreet.  Had a most enjoyable stay"
January 2019,Very nice hotel,"A very pleasant hotel, just the right size, ideally located in a quiet part of Belgravia, yet 5 min walk to Knightsbridge. Staff very pleasant, food very good. You are welcomed with champagne. Highly recommended."
February 2019,Best of British,"We booked 2 rooms from Australia one evening.  The reception/booking staff were extremely obliging and helpful.  On arrival feeling tired from the trip, the doorman whisked our bags away and gave us a generous welcome.  This continued through to checkin.  As we had limited time in London we asked for directions to Harrods immediately which was literally minutes away.  When we returned after several hours the staff observed our tiredness.  Insisting on a cup of tea being sent to our rooms.   We were treated like royalty.  Being two 65+ yo women this is quite rare.  The rooms once we entered were luxurious, modern and warm both in temperature and ambience.  I would not hesitate in recommending The Hari to any form of visitor and would give it a 10+ for every aspect possible in a‚Ä¶"
January 2019,Enjoyed our stay,We had a good feeling walking into the hotel and you could see the staff had been well selected and motivated. Room was clean and comfortable and we slept very well. There is a very relaxed feeling in the hotel and warm decor. My wife was very happy with the hotel and we will definitely use again.
February 2019,Family Birthday ,"Hi Just had an amazing weekend at The Hari, celebrating a family birthday.  Could not fault anything staff, rooms, food, location all five star and great.  Will definitely return. If you are looking for a great hotel in a great location you will not go wrong with booking your stay at The Hari Many thanks to all  KTx "
January 2019,Excellent,"A very nice and luxury hotel in Belgravia with a stunning friendly and supporting staff. Great rooms and first class breakfast. Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace and some very fine restaurants are just around the corner."
January 2019,Excellent rooms and excellent service,"Relliable good old fashioned British hospitality. The room service as well as the staff¬¥s attention where always over the top, location is posh and so is everything they have to offer. Doesn¬¥t let down your expectations"
January 2019,"Lovely hotel, excellent location ","We stayed in the Hari on a Saturday evening. The hotel location is perfect and we enjoyed excellent service, including drinks and snacks in the relaxed and luxurious bar. It is in walking distance to Harrods and the V&A. I had the best nights‚Äô sleep I‚Äôd had in a long time and woke refreshed for heading on our holiday! Thank you Hari. - Dave and Helen"
January 2019,Tiny Room,"We thought that the location of the hotel was lovely.  It was surrounded by beautiful stores and still in a quiet neighborhood.  The rooms were absolutely tiny, however, for the price.  Yes, I do realize we were in Belgravia.  The hotel staff did accomodate us by removing the desk chair from the room so that midnight trips to the bathroom weren't toe removing!  The lobby and bar of the hotel are busy all times of day and night with business people and travelers enjoying a drink or having meetings.  This hotel was lovely and boutique, but probably just a little too tony for our taste!"
January 2019,Upscale tiny suites in great location,"The hotel is a real boutique hotel, nice decor, lower ceiling for my tall husband. Location is lovely. Good bedding and amenties nothing special but nice The star of this hotel is the italian restaurant. a plus many italian well educated staff."
January 2019,"Stylish hotel, excellent service","A very stylish yet cosy luxury hotel, with many thoughtful touches to make guests feel welcome. The personnel is very attentive, friendly and efficient. The location is excellent, mid-way between Knightsbridge and Sloane Square, in one of the most elegant areas of London."
January 2019,Located 5-10 min walk from Sloane square,"Located 5-10 min walk from Sloane square. Making it easy to get to a wide variety of restaurants.  Staff very welcoming and friendly, and obvious but low-key security at reception.  The rooms are a good size, but the bathroom is very spacious.  There is a hotel restaurant and bar, that looked lovely, but we did not use it."
January 2019,Fantastic!,"The staff were so friendly and helpful, and very welcoming. The welcome drink was a real treat! The rooms are a great size and very comfortable. Great hotel bar and breakfast room. The hotel is in a great location as well. Would absolutely recommend this hotel. "
January 2019,An excellent hotel in every way,"This hotel is well situated, comfortable, has an amazing relaxing environment, its quirky d√©cor is refreshing change to the larger chain hotels. All the staff were fantastic and could not have done any more to make our stay more enjoyable."
January 2019,Stay Here,"Walking distance to just about everything and if not, the tube is a five minute walk away. Hotel bar was inviting with great cocktails and no rush if you needed a place to unwind. The staff was really accommodating so much so that we decided to extend our trip an extra day because the concierge insisted we visit a Dior exhibit at the V&A that was totally sold out, but the hotel had some tickets for purchase. Everyone was so friendly, how refreshing coming form the states. The rooms were very cozy and the bathrooms are fit for some IG selfies. Do yourself a favor and stay at The Hari."
August 2018,Perfect birthday experience,"I stayed here with friends to celebrate my birthday and I couldn‚Äôt fault a thing.  The team were very friendly and always very happy to help. Special thanks to Joanna, James and Hannah!   The location was perfect and I hope to come back soon!  Thanks again!"
January 2019,Special London Hotel gem...,"My third visit to the Hari. I like this hotel because of it's location, general atmosphere and the very personal attention you receive from the wonderful staff. Nothing is too much trouble & for weary business travellers this is exactly what is required. Very nice rooms, cozy bar & excellent breakfast.  Well done team Hari.. Bradley (NZ)"
December 2018,Excellent hotel,"I stayed in The Hari in January 2019, the location couldnt be better, near Harvey Nichols,  the V&A, knightsbridge, convenient and accessible tube stations nearby. Also, close by Pavillion road which has been transformed. Very friendly and efficient team."
December 2018,Good Location,"The hotel was warm and friendly. This is by no means a large hotel, a comfortable boutique place, well located just behind Harvey Nichols and walking distance to Harrods. The rooms were quite small (we changed from the 1st we were given as it was right opposite the lift). Both were small with odd placed bathrooms. The 2 main nagging issues were that although there were 2 lifts, only one was ever operational. We also booked breakfast in bed. This was well below a 5 star standard. Everything was either over fried, under cooked or cold. We opted to have breakfast outside on our second morning"
September 2018,Great hotel with amazing service,"The hotel was in a very good location and the service across the board was amazing from the front desk reception to the concierge, and the gentlemen who greet you at the entrance. Room was a  bit small but the service more than made up for it."
September 2018,Such a nice weekend,We spent 3 perfect days at the Hari. Our room with view ont the park was incredible (big favorite for the marble bathroom). Thank you to the staff of the Hari for all the kind attention. They made my break during this weekend. I hope to come back very soon. 
September 2018,A magical weekend in London,"I recently stayed at The Hari as party of a girls weekend in London. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, we were made to feel important and special. We were greatened warmly by the staff at all times throughout the Hotel. Our room was simply stunning, with breaking views over the London skyline. We ate breakfast at the Il Pampero restaurant and were presently surprised at the value of money of the √Ä la carte menu, which set us up nicely for a day shopping in London. We finished the day in the terrace bar, a relaxing way to unwind after a night out. I ended our stay with plans to return with my Husband as soon as possible. A truly magical weekend away."
September 2018,The best in London (Second Visit),"we booked from 1st January to 11 January 2019.  This time is the second time for us to go for the Hari hotel. you can check my previous review about the hotel, here is the additional one. i can say that the hotel is one of the best in London in location, security, staff, cleanness, and value of money for everything ! it is really worthy to pay it when you plan to go for London.   The staff from A to Z are really amazing, helpful and friendly. They helped us with every single inquiry we asked for ! location is just by walk to everything you want ! pharmacy, market, restaurants, Harrods Hyde park ... etc.   Thank you for making our vacation amazing for second time.   Muhannad Abudaoud"
September 2018,Amazing hotel,I travel the world and I can say this boutique hotel is a must. Very good quality price. Amazing mattress. Marble barthroom. A great atmosphere with a concierge and a bar. The only think that could be improved is the quality of the breakfast. All the rest is perfect. 
September 2018,Break from the kids,We found the Hari to be well placed for key attractions around London. The rooms were clean and the beds extremely comfortable. The staff throughout were very friendly and helpful. The food was also of a very high standard. 
August 2018,So happy,I was so happy to stay in this hotel they had a very good service and relaxing time! Good Location. Very sequire. Sabrina was very helpful! Thank you to the Hari h√¥tel team and I‚Äôll visit again for sure!!! Specially SABRINA THANK YOU!!!!!
September 2018,Boutique Gem w/ Best London location & Italian cuisine,"The Hari did not disappoint!! You could not find a team more gracious and professional. I loved the room decor (wood & marble flooring) and safe, stocked mini bar..... all the 5 star amenities. The second floor lounge is huge! Lots of room & work space for a biz traveler. And restaurant is gorgeous & exceptional. Lighting in room could be enhanced just a touch, but minor as huge windows let in lots of natural light :)  Enjoy!!"
September 2018,London at Christmas,"Great hotel in an excellent location.  This hotel is in Belgravia area of London close to both the Sloan Square and Knightbridge Underground station.  It is a ~10 minute walk to Harrods.  The management, staff and concierge team were all so nice and helpful.  We are a family of five and got two interconnecting rooms with a separate, private outside door.  Great room setup for a family with three children.  The rooms were very nice with upgraded and posh finishes.  Belgravia is an upscale area of London with great restaurants and shopping.  Very easy to access the tourist sites in Central London either via Underground Subway or via Taxi."
August 2018,Wonderful Stay at The Hari,"My complete experience from check-in to check-out was a 10+!  I‚Äôm usually the one who has to change my room at least a couple of times before being satisfied. The room I had (just for myself), was perfect! My top faves: CLEAN, QUIET, WELL LIT, EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE FIRM BED (and pillows), EASY TO NAVIGATE THE ELECTRONICS AND LIGHTING.  The staff could it be more eager to assist. Great location."
July 2018,Excellent service in a modern boutique hotel,We stayed in the Hari for one night during a theatre trip to London for my wife‚Äôs birthday. A warm welcome before arriving in our very comfortable room with a nice view. Small details were nice to experience and the service from all members of staff was excellent and with genuine enthusiasm. Would stay there again in a heartbeat. Thank you Giuseppe and the team.
July 2018,Fantastic ,"I‚Äôve been staying at the Hari during business trips off and on for over two years. I can‚Äôt say enough about this place. The restaurant, room and bar are top notch and the staff are absolutely AMAZING! Highly recommend it!!!!   Ps. The pic is of a gift (a book) and a handwritten note by the staff celebrating our second ‚ÄúHari-versary‚Äù... just a nice personal touch that you‚Äôd never see nowadays!"
May 2018,My home in London,Homely feeling friendly well trained flexible efficient team members from arrival at door step to check in - beautifully appointed accommodation with amazing bathroom and shower room comfortable king size bed very good Italian food great choice of breakfast items top amenities did not want to leave!
June 2018,Afra,Nice hotel near to Harrods and all nice restaurants. 9 min walk to Hyde park. Clean nice and you will feel home. The single room is too small so it‚Äôs for one person and cannot take another one. I‚Äôm planning to stay again on it for my next trip.
June 2018,An example to hotels everywhere on how to do it right!,I always recommend the Hari when anyone is looking for an excellent hotel in London.   I absolutely adore this hotel. The decor is gorgeous. Every amenity is to hand. The location is amazing. They do a really good breakfast and the bar is atmospheric and does a great cocktail. What is exceptional about this hotel though is the staff. From the front desk to the restaurant and bar the customer care is second to none.   In this  instance I have to particularly mention the Concierge team ... Ben and Diego. I left a gift at reception and had to arrange to have it sent on to me. I had an issue  with the courier afterwards. I always think the best way to judge customer care is when there is a problem. They were extremely mannerly and efficient in dealing with my issue and had it‚Ä¶
June 2018,Wonderful!,"I booked for a birthday treat for my partner and we had a great night, loved the boutique feel of the hotel and even more so the friendliness of all the staff. The room & location is great too - on a quiet street but eay access to the shops and restaurants. The birthday brownies and fizz in our room just made it for us. Thanks too all at the Hari for making it a great night - we would love to come back, definitely a hotel with personality!"
June 2018,a week in london,"lovely, cozy upscale hotel for those who like a smaller hotel. Staff is very kind and helpful, always going the extra step to make you feel home and comfortable. location is great, very central and close to everything, either by foot, cab or tube "
June 2018,A gem,"worth a visit, close to the tube and of course Harrods. The staff are excellent, food in the italian restaurant is to die for. Decor is modern and eye catching. The bar is a nice spot to relax after a long day!"
June 2018,Fantastic Hotel and Team,"Having stayed at the Hari many times now. The rooms are generous and well fitted, very clean and modern inside The Staff/ Team are a huge drawing point. Very well managed and thoughtful, you'll quickly get to know the whole team. Restaurant and bar are the same. Lovely food with friendly staff and reasonable pricing "
June 2018,Home in London,This is our go-to hotel in London. Very close to everything between Chelsea/Kensington/Mayfair. Staff are very friendly and helpful. The concierge service offers great tips and assistance. The Hari is a good balance between boutique and class.
May 2018,The amazing staff makes this a 5 star hotel,"I was looking for a modern hotel in a great area. The Hari was the perfect choice. Boutique hotel. Belgravia is a beautiful neighborhood. Close to everything. The staff is so friendly, professional and helpful. I‚Äôm sure all their business is repeat. Once you are there, you wouldn‚Äôt want to stay anywhere else. Oh and the hotel has great bikes you can ride around and see all the major sites. Shout out to Stefania, Estefano, Z, Matthias, Daniel, Ben, Diego, Nerius... all rockstars!"
April 2018,First time London visit ,"First time in my life to visit London. The location of the hotel is in Belgravia, where the nice and quiet neighborhood. I was told the neighborhood was one of the wealthiest residential area in the world. The hotel provides the rent bike service which allowed me to explore the neighborhood in the morning.  The location also is close to all famous tourist spots like Hyde park and Buckingham palace, Harrods....   The hotel public area and room was designed very chic and cozy. The bed was very comfortable and the bath was covered by stone tile. Clean and neat. The closet is all concealed in the hallway.  The only thing I would not pretty satisfied was the USB port. There was only one port in the room.   Overall I would recommend to stay with the Hari when visiting London."
April 2018,Intimate and stylish,"What a gem, tucked away in a fabulous location it‚Äôs stylish and intimate but with incredible service. The concierge couldn‚Äôt do enough to help but he was not intrusive in the slightest, all the staff were very helpful and the service was impeccable. The rooms were well thought out and there were some lovely touches; mobile phones in each room for the guests to use and they knew it was an anniversary stay so we had a surprise waiting in the room. We will most certainly be returning."
April 2018,As good as it gets,As good as it gets .....this hotel was an unexpected discovery. Perfect locality superb service . The hotel restaurant is Pampero and it is now my favorite Italian restaurant in London . This hotel in my eyes deserves to be number one for London hotels 
April 2018,Happy at this Hotel,"Decorated and maintained in flawless manner. From the bellboys to the ma√Ætre d‚Äô, the staff was friendly, eager to assist, and most professional.  We appreciated the warm welcome to London from Petra.  Rooms are spacious and well appointed for settling in to a comfortable five night stay in the space. The turn down service is great. There was some outer scaffolding obstructing a bit of the view, but not to our distress. Breakfast ordered from the menu was a better choice than the buffet. Morning room service was prompt. The restaurant was a fine dining experience. Delicious food, good wine selection, expert wait staff, and charming chef all added to our evening at the il Pampero. There is every attempt to make your stay as enjoyable as possible! There are two close by Underground‚Ä¶"
April 2018,We‚Äôll be back!!!,"Lovely modern and comfortable boutique hotel, very convenient to shopping and the restaurants in Knightbridge. The beds were truly ‚Äúheavenly‚Äù and the bathrooms were spacious and luxurious. The photos on the hotel‚Äôs website do it justice. The bar is fabulous, too! We WILL be back!"
April 2018,Royal Ascot,Extremely comfortable delightful team of staff who couldn't do enough to help you enjoy your stay and our room although the view had a bit of scaffolding outside was so nice and immaculately clean throughout our stay. 
April 2018,Wedding celebrations!,"We‚Äôve had the most amazing stay at the Hari!! We  booked to stay for our wedding celebration as our wedding was being held in Chelsea! Great location,stunning hotel! I can honestly say that the staff made it extra special and went above and beyond to give us the best three nights! I‚Äôd like to thank Lovely Joanna for all the extra touches,great way to start our new life as Mr & Mrs!! Helpful door staff! Fab concierge Diego and no forgetting Dylan that made my daughters day!! She wants to come back again,I‚Äôm sure we will!! Most of all I must thank Liz!! All you have done means so much! Thank you again!!... PS..the doughnuts are a must üíó"
April 2018,This hotel is tops,"From the check-in to check-out the Hari had the nicest staff. At check-in the front desk person offered water, espresso and cookies immediately. The bell hop took our bags to the room with us and explained every little detail of the hotel and room. The concierge reserved a perfect place for us for both lunch and dinner. The bar staff where we had our afternoon rest stop was so friendly. The location of the Hari was very convenient and allowed us to walk to many of our destinations. Thanks to the Hari for a warm and welcoming stay!"
April 2018,"Wonderful Hotel, very charming staff, lovely stay!!","Last week we have traveled for two days to London and we have stayed at the Hari Hotel. Privileged location for a pleasant walk through the Belgravia neighborhood and access on foot to the beautiful shops of Sloane Street and the most famous department stores in London. The hotel and all its spaces are tremendously welcoming and warm, the room very cozy, spacious and bright, full of nice details. The bed, one of the most comfortable that I have slept in all my life. In our case, we have had breakfast a la carte, delicious coffee and juice, pancakes and perfect eggs. One afternoon we have had a drink in the beautiful bar on the first floor, where there is also a very nice terrace. We have not had time to try the restaurant, of which we had very good references. And finally,‚Ä¶"
June 2018,Extremely polite staff,"I was there a few days ago and found he staff very polite, compared to other places I have been. Atmosphere is nice and cozy. There is nice restaurant and food is tasty. Prices are pretty normal for that location and level of experience.  From my room there was a view to London Eye and the Shard, also there was a small cozy balcony, where you could go out and take a look at the city."
June 2018,Wonderful Stay!,"We were in London for my husband's 35th birthday, and headed to a Manchester United  game. The Hari was the perfect hotel for a relaxing vacation. As soon as we arrived we were warmly greeted and upgraded to a King Suite room overlooking the park. The room was bright and modern and even had a sitting nook! The hotel itself is very trendy and has a great bar upstairs with fantastic cocktails.All of the staff went out of their way to make us feel special and welcome. They even left us a bottle of champagne and wine on separate nights to celebrate the occasion.   I have been to London several time but never stayed in the area where the Hari is located, and i fell in love with London all over again. The area is similar to the upper east side in NYC; lovely townhomes, cozy cafes,‚Ä¶"
June 2018,"Lovely hotel, amazing staff","This hotel is amazing. Myself and my husband enjoyed our stay here. Unfortunately, I was very sick with a stomach bug so I didn‚Äôt get to enjoy the hotel as much as I would‚Äôve liked, thankfully our room was really nice and cozy. My husband enjoyed the drinks and found the service at the bar great. There was also a large variety of books and magazines in the lobby to read.  Mostly good but there was a few negatives. I found the bed was a bit too hard. I love firm mattresses, but this was extremely firm. I found it very busy and noisy during certain periods of the day in our room because there was a lot of staff going in and out of the room next to ours which I found very odd. The terrace area was beautiful but people were smoking cigars out there and it was quite overwhelming.‚Ä¶"
May 2018,Amazing hotel !,Great hotel fantastic location and very friendly staff looking forward to my next stay ! Great views from the rooms excellent room service and a good Concierge team who are very professional would highly recommend. Adam.
May 2018,Superb location and sterling staff,We stayed at The Hari hotel in Belgravia last week. We cannot fault it. The staff were amazing and the bed was one of the comfiest we've ever had the pleasure of sleeping in.  They have a fantastic breakfast in the hotel restaurant and the bar isnt too shabby either. If you're looking for an 'all round' great place to stay in central london - look no further.
May 2018,OK...,Nice enough place. Not cheap. Used to be the Sheraton at one point. Had a facelift. All a bit meh.. location is not bad though it is v quiet if you seek action. High end residentially neighbourhood. Room was small and boxy.. NY style.. modern design and furnishings. Nice enough. Staff were friendly and pleasant. Just a bit like a high end Sheraton with a new coat of paint.. which it kind of is... 
July 2017,Best Hotel in London,"Have been staying at the Hari for years and it never fails to excell. Just stayed there for a week and it was like home away from home. We were remembered by staff from the moment we arrived and made to feel more than welcome. Our favorite room was waiting for us and we settled right in. Benjamin, the concierge, worked his magic and got us tickets to a brand new, sold out show and, over all, it could not have been better.   The Hari is the only place we stay while in London. Truly 5 star."
May 2018,"Amazing Hotel, Service and Location","The hotel is fantastic with a great vibe.  I was there for a business trip and received an upgrade to Junior suite with a wonderful view . The room is excellent and the staff just awesome. Someone is always there to not just greet you but have a non intrusive, nice short conversations, with you while you wait for a cab, walking to your room etc.  The front office teams and the boys at the front are amazing.  Location is perfect - walking distance to major shopping and good restaurants  My stay there was nothing short of exceptional in every way !"
May 2018,A true sample of excellent hospitality,"Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the staff , they were very helpful and friendly with great hospitality,The room was clean and comfy. Good location; very close to everything.Overall experience was awesome ,We will definitely choose this hotel when we return to London."
May 2018,Excellent Staff and Service,"I‚Äôve stayed at this property 7-8 times and always a lovely experience.  The staff are very pleasant and helpful and the location is excellent if you like to be close to the parks.  The room is plenty spacious for a solo traveler.  It isn‚Äôt always easy traveling alone, but the staff make it easy to forget."
May 2018,Quiet Perfection in Belgravia,"Stylish and quality hotel in upscale and quiet Belgravia, but still central. Easy access to three Underground lines. Restaurants shops and parks close by. Morning and evening strolls past diplomat cars and embassy fronts helped with the ambience. Ground floor restaurant is fantastic Italian, and the 1st floor bar is super mod cool. Friendly and helpful staff were abundant and always willing to help. Turn down service with water and treats is always fun. Our new go-to."
May 2018,Outstanding service and comfort,"When booking the Hari do ask for room 308. Will accommodate the comfort needs of most egos. Chill in the plush comfort of a beautifully appointed but welcoming room with an amazing bed.   I returned to this property after finding an affordable deal on TripAdvisor and was so pleased with the high quality of service at the front desk and most importantly at the il Pampero Italian Bar and Restaurent  where Dario Amoroso made sure we had a super generous and delicious breakfast. It made our day.  The staff at this property could not have been more helpful, more pleasant and fabulously accommodating.  A must must try."
May 2018,So relaxe,My family were came and really enjoy for every single moments  Love the interior  Full of love  Full of togetherness  Wanna come back again again and again  Love travel around the worlds  Hope my family always enjoy and always create memorable experiences
May 2018,Amazing hotel,Such an amazing hotel! We stayed in a beautiful room with a bathtub overlooking the park. We stayed on the night of our wedding and we were treated like royalty! The bar serves great cocktails and the breakfast was delicious! 
May 2018,Best stay at a hotel.,"Stayed one night only, meeting family members from the USA. From the moment you walk into the hotel, the friendly doormen, Charlie at the front desk to an immaculate room, you will have to look far to find any fault. After a busy day and night out at the theater we had a late night light snack at the bar, only once again to be bowled over by an excellent bartender and wonderful recommendations regarding some of the Gin they stocked. This has been one the best hotels I have stayed in forty years of travelling, lovely location within reach of most major sites and very peaceful and quiet. In my opinion, when one is treated as the most important guest by all the staff, they deserve to get the best recommendation one can give."
May 2018,Great hotel in Knightsbridge,"Fantastic stay, very comfortable and quiet room, immaculately clean and brilliant staff. Old fashioned service with a contemporary twist. Thoroughly recommended and a nice bar too. Brilliant base for Knightsbridge."
April 2018,One of the best hotels in the heart of London!,"Excellent location, friendly and helpful staff, organic breakfast and traditional as well! The rooms are spacious, the design and colors wonderful, marble bathroom and comfortable bed for a good night rest! Piccadilly tube station is nearby, almost five minutes walk, close to Sloane  square as well!"
May 2018,"Superb hotel, one of the best boutique hotels in London","I stayed here with my husband for his 40th birthday. Fantastic hotel, excellent location, staff couldn‚Äôt do enough for us yet were discreet. Special mention to Joanna in guest relations, Michael in the bar, Daniel the bellman who always had a smile on his face and the concierge who managed to get us a table for duck and waffle when we were unable to. The rooms are larger than we expected and very well appointed. Will definitely be returning soon. Thank you to all the staff at The Hari."
May 2018,Modern boutique hotel,"We were welcomed for our anniversary with a bottle of champagne and 2 bottle of wine and chocolate mousse. This is definitely one the best option in Chelsea/kensington/belgravia. Modern decor, clean rooms, professional staff and great location make this hotel very unique in London.    It's a little bit pricey but it's worth it!"
January 2018,40th Birthday celebrations,Have to say what an amazing hotel. Ideal location in central London. The rooms are well appointed with great lighting. Service is very attentive yet subtle. Food was delicious with a great selection of cocktails and drinks. Loved the special extra touches for my birthday. Overall fantastic experience in a boutique London hotel. Highly recommend to anyone.
January 2018,Perfect ,"I don‚Äôt often write reviews but when I do I go big! What a great stay! I would recommend to anyone. It‚Äôs a great location, close to good shops, cafes, and tourist sites.  The staff were amazing and catered to all our needs precisely and with a smile. We have a newborn and they were fantastic at helping us settle in.  They allowed us a early and late checkout, gave great recommendations on dining and  were always willing to help.  This place is highly recommendable. We are staying here again two weeks. Well played ‚Äú The Hari‚Äù well played! "
January 2018,Vacation,"This is a wonderful, quiet hotel in Belgravia. The very personalized service enhances the stay and visit. The rooms are small but good storage and a very comfort bed. Spotless. Would recommend for couples"
June 2017,"Location; good, service; good, quality; good.","When booking, I wanted to find a place which was new to me so thanks TripAdvisor! I had brought 2 extra guests with me so instead of getting 2 rooms I opted for the king suite because it had a king bed and a separate room with a pullout. I was somewhat underwhelmed when I entered the room because the ‚Äúlounge‚Äù seemed a little basic but actually it was high quality. The king bed was delightful but the a/c in the room seemed to be hit or miss and didn‚Äôt quite get the room as cold as I typically like. Having the window open on the second floor was quite loud so it was a catch 22; loud and cold or warmer and quiet. All the furnishings in the room were of high quality and the community areas were very well appointed with books everywhere! The bar was lovely with a great option of‚Ä¶"
January 2018,tp,Amazing hotel and location. rooms are nice and very well serviced. the staff is great and very helpful. the food and breakfast are very good and so is the whole ambiance of the hotel! strongly recommend it!
January 2018,Perfect Boutique hotel in Belgravia,On arrival we were greeted with lovely doormen who took our car keys. Our check in very smooth and friendly. Our suite was fabulous with a lovely big double shower and bath. Lots of light .....our first visit and it won‚Äôt be our last! 
October 2017, Cleanliness in Rooms Poor,Overall the staff is polite and courteous however the cleanliness in the room needs improvement. There is a lot of dust accumulation on the bed side tables and furniture even after cleaning. The hotel is small but an efficient hotel with all modern amenities.  It is centrally located and coincerge and the doormen are more than willingy to help the guests .
January 2018,A haven in London,"This was my second stay at the Hari and it was even better than my first visit. The hotel greeted me warmly, upgraded my room and made sure I had everything I needed (dinner reservations etc) to make my stay relaxing and enjoyable."
October 2017,Last Stop,"A great hotel , in a great location, with welcoming and attentive staff. I stay at this hotel regularly and they are on the ball with everything you need. It is a hotel for everyone, business and vacation."
January 2018,Good to be back,"It was great to return to the Hari, the staff were extremely welcoming and we forgot how  attentive they are. After a full day shopping .... it was great to drop into the bar for a cocktail which has such cool music... The beds are so relaxing  with white linen ready for you to fall into..   we will be back u soooooooon!  "
January 2018,"Great service, and a great hotel!","The hotel itself is amazing inside and out. When I arrived, I was offered a drink at reception. I was checked-in, then went to my room. The room didn't have a walk in shower (however was advertised) so I went and told reception, they happily moved me to another room. I would 100% stay again. At ¬£300+ a room, it isn't cheap, but defintely worth the money. I stayted in one of the King Deluxe rooms. It's also in a great location just five minutes in a cab from Victoria and a stones throw from the Kings Road in Chelsea."
February 2018,Great hotel!,"The staff at The Hari Hotel were incredibly accommodating and extremely helpful.  Although the hotel was in a quiet neighborhood, it was in a central location with good access to public transportation, restaurants, shopping, and museums. "
November 2017,Great service.,"Would highly recommend the Hari. The interior is beautiful but what really makes the place special are the people working there. Friendly, sassy and professional with excellent attention to detail.  Really enjoyed my stay and look forward to returning. "
February 2018,belgravia boutique with cute furnishings and a great bar and terrace,"great location in the heart of belgravia, lovely rooms if a little small, may not suit all, great service, and super cozy and cool bar area with a cigar terrace to spend sunday afternoons - penthouse suite can be great fun"
February 2018,perfect location,"staying at the Hari was part of my 80th birthday celebrations, perfectly placed for our evening entertainment at the Royal Albert Hotel, and on the following day a visit to the V & A museum, The Queens Gallery etc. I have awarded this hotel and its staff a 100% rating for their facilities, welcome and hospitality, they were truly wonderful to myself and my wife and we cant thank them enough. Do we recommend them ? yes of course, and will we return, we certainly hope so, they will be the first we contact on our next trip to london, hopefully later this year. Thank you Hari we are still talking about you to our family and friends."
January 2018,They have the best bar assistant manager(Andrea),"I visit this place quite frequently, one of my favorite spots in london! Their lounge atomsphere is very chill and laid back. And their service is great, the reason i always visit back their place is their assistant bar manager andrea. He is very helpful and welcoming he always looks out for the customers and makes sure they are satified with everything and enjoying their time. I really like and recommend this place thanks to Andrea, and for whoever who goes there ask for him!"
January 2018,Affordable Luxury with Great Location,I was excited to go back to the Hari Hotel - even though its name changed from my stay a few years ago the Hotel and staff are as amazing as ever. You really cannot get a better hotel for this rate - from the moment you walk in to the hotel there is someone there to greet you and make sure you have everything for your stay. Little things like sending tea to my room upon check-in really make an impression in feeing like this is a home away from home. The street view from the room is gorgeous and the bathroom is very luxurious with some of the fluffiest towels I have had the pleasure to use. Although we were only there for a one night business trip I look forward to returning soon with my family for pleasure!
January 2018,NFL Games,"The Hari was amazing! The hotel was very modern and up to date! I enjoyed the mobile phone that was available for us to use throughout the city. Bikes were even available if we wanted to use them to get around the city! The rooms were a nice size, obviously smaller than US rooms but perfect and quaint. I definitely enjoyed my stay! "
February 2018,Excellent location,Stayed here for 2 nights on a businuss trip. Location near our office. Excellent service. Rooms to the street can be noisy. What they must improve is their coffee. Nice interior design. Friendly and attentive doormen.
January 2018,Just simply amazing for the second time!,"I was very excited to found out that me and my partner are going back to this amazing property. As expected, it did not disappoint us. In fact, it was even better! The moment we arrived at the hotel, their bellman and the receptionist greeted us with a warm smile. A couple of minutes after, Ms. Joanna showed up and guided us enthusiastically to the suite. Yes! This time we stayed at The Hari suite! My jaw just dropped and could not stop smiling up to my ears. It was just wonderful! I could say it‚Äôs one of the best suites that I have been to. There‚Äôs a fireplace and two balconies where we took some nice shots of the view using the Instax mini that they have provided free of charge to use. We captured special memories using this incredible gadget. Moreover, we also used the mobile‚Ä¶"
January 2018,Wonderful stay (again)!,"The Hari is an excellent hotel, with an unbeatable location and wonderful, warm staff - these are what I come back for time and time again. Everything went smoothly, and I have to give special mention to the front desk staff who had my room ready at 7am, when I checked in very early. It was great to be able to go straight to my room after a long flight, as opposed to waiting for the usual 3pm check in. Room service was faultless, both their breakfast and all-day options are great and a good go-to for those too tired or lazy to head out (although the hotel is very near great cafes around Belgravia & Chelsea, as well as Harrods and Harvey Nichols). As always, I am looking forward to my next visit! Thank you!"
December 2017,Exceptional!,"Service, and exceptional service at that costs nothing. The Hari have it spot on! From the moment we stepped into the hotel nothing was too much trouble. Every person we came into contact with could not have been more helpful. The handwritten note and homemade biscuits in our room was a thoughtful touch, and we will return.  Authentic and memorable? Absolutely!"
December 2017,Classic hotel,I like It's look like combination classic and modern Hotel because sofa all of hotel like combination Classic and Modern But Classic so so Many but Modern Not many like small yups i like it Combination so Great
October 2017,Perfect hotel,"Small luxurious hotel. The location is Very good. The staff is extremely nice. The rooms are modern, Very clean and cosy. With evrything you will ever need in them. Breakfast is very good.  Would certainly come back to this hotel.   "
December 2017,Overnight stay .,This was the third time we have stayed at the Hari Hotel.Staff are always pleasant and very friendly. Very comfortable and relaxing place to stay. Overnight stay to meet family who was staying as always at the Hari Hotel on business from Australia.
December 2017,Great Hotel and Staffs,We stayed around 1 week in January and we really enjoyed. The hotel is in a prime location. Walking distance to Harrods.  All staffs were extremely friendly and helpful.  The hotel interior was very nice. The room was comfortable. And we really liked our stay in this hotel. 
November 2017,Another great night,"My favourite hotel, friendly and so comfortable, stay here every time.  Had room service for a very early breakfast, bang on time, really good breakfast.  Reception always charming and welcoming.  Beds wonderful."
October 2017,Top notch and far superior to many 5* hotels in London,"My company travel policy recently changed from 5* to 4* hotels in London and I chose The Hari based on the reviews and score on TripAdvisor. Both the reviews and scores were spot on and well deserved.  The hotel is brilliantly located with Victoria, Sloane Square and Knightsbridge tube stations all an easy walk away. There are also some useful bus routes if like me you don't always want to take the tube. Good choice of restaurants and excellent shopping in the local neighbourhood too.  The rooms are compact but so well thought out and even though I stayed 7 nights with a lot of luggage, there was plenty of space to move around. Great shower and bathroom set up. Loved the wooden floor too.  Did not eat in the restaurant for dinner but the continental breakfast is plentiful and‚Ä¶"
November 2017,Incredible hotel throughout ,"Booked a 4 night stay. Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by the staff and were checked in an upgraded room. Larger than usual rooms (in London standards), very clean and tastefully designed. Shower/bath excellent. Hotel lobby, facilities and restaurant were spick and span.  Service was truly exceptional, attentive, fast and kind. Nothing about the staff felt fake or forced and they gave the kind of service which felt honest and made us feel at home. The neighborhood is just perfect. Quiet and calm but close enough to stroll around or, alternatively, comfortably commute via public transport around town. Great value for money. Highly recommended"
November 2017,The Greatest boutique hotels in London,Stayed with my family at The Hari for a week. The friendly and helpful team went above and beyond to make my wife‚Äôs birthday special. We travelled with our baby and for such a posh hotel they were extremely family friendly- from helping with the pushchair to recommending suitable restaurants. The hotel is ideally located and a few minutes away from most tourist sites in central London. The rooms are very comfortable and clean. Room service and front desk are responsive and attentive. Suitable for every type of Traveller. The Hari ticked all the boxes for me! 
November 2017,"Great staff, Great property, Great location",Thank you to Simona for everything. She always makes our stay unique. When we arrived she made sure we would have a list of nice bars and restaurants. Staff as a whole is very helpful. Great 5 Star hotel for people that wish to feel at home.
October 2017,Great London location - dark room,"I visited the hotel for a long Christmas weekend with my 10 year old child.  We arrived at 15 o'clock to the hotel. and the room was ready at 15:30 so we waited in the lobby.  The staff was very friendly when we arrived and check in went well. I got a room at the 5th floor.   The room had a very small living room, a bedroom and a even small bathroom. The room in general is very nice and function ok. but it was small very small! We had a issue with one of the windows that could not close completely. which meant that the room was very cold. we reported it but it was not fixed during our stay nor did we receive any proposal from management to change room. not really nice when you have 3 days in the same room with a very cold 10 year kid. The room is very dark. that is ok if you‚Ä¶"
October 2017,Warm stay in the winter,This is the second time I‚Äôve stayed in this hotel which I consider my home in London. The rooms are spacious and wooden floored which is the right thing to avoid allergies. The team is very warm always ready to fulfill all guests requests. I suggest this hotel to everyone who wants to be taken care and pampered.
October 2017,Welcoming stay - will return!,"It's not often that I stay at a hotel that exceeds my expectations, but The Hari definitely did. What I loved the most about this place were the members of staff - it's a cliche when people say ""they really couldn't do enough for me"" but in this case it totally applies. For example, when I needed a steam service rather than a press service for the delicate gowns that I had with me, they let me use the hotel's steamer (as the dry cleaner they use doesn't offer a steam service). The staff are extremely friendly and will do their best to help with any request, which is what you need when you're away from home.   The room was a tad small, but lovely (and typical size for London, really) - comfortable bed and a beautiful view over London from a little balcony. If I were to be picky‚Ä¶"
October 2017,Remarkable guest service,We arrived late night and were very disappointed with the room we booked..it is called kings suit however it was ridiculously small.. We hated the hotel and we seriously wer thinking of changing to a different hotel the next day. when we complained they promised to upgrade us the following morning. The next day we came back to the hotel to fund that all our stuff moved to a beautiful spacious room with amazing views. Throughout our stay the staff proved to be highly professional in addition to being super nice and sweet..starting with the doorman..reception..concierge..room service..etc.  Breakfast at the restaurant is excellent..especially the eggs Benedict and the pancakes. The beds are super comfy with high quality bedding. The bathroom was beautiful..it has a Jacuzzi with a‚Ä¶
October 2017,First class!,"We were given a warm welcome by the doorman and our check was very efficient but friendly. Our room was very cosy and was well equipped with everything needed for a relaxing stay. Bathrobes and slippers are also provided and some decent toiletries in the bathroom. We did try the bar which was great too! Friendly and knowledgeable barman who looked after us well.  Location is good too, for shopping and some good places to eat."
October 2017,Outstanding,"Thank you for a brilliant stay.  I will definitely be back.   Outstanding service, great attention to detail, delicious evening meal in the restaurant.     No request too much trouble.  A rate find.   Look forward to becoming a regular visitor "
October 2017,Stunning 5+star Boutique hotel,"Boutique hotels are all the rage. This is in a class all by itself from the moment you are greeted by Jack the door man. Our room was not yet ready since we arrived from Heathrow mid morning. Carlo on the front desk treated us to breakfast in the hotel""s restaurant bar....rich golden scrambled eggs and five star treatment by Elena. A smart phone was charged and ready to go in our room..invaluable when out in the city.  Room details perfect and sweet touch with gourmet chocolates at night. Ben the concierge handled the booking of our tours and gave invaluable advice for all our needs in London. We will definitely return!"
September 2017,Wonderful place,"We stayed at the Hari for a romantic couple and everything was so perfect, from the start with Jorge to help us with our bags under a heavy rain, everybody at the front desk was so nice and helpful and the concierge made our trip even better. I would definetly recommend The Hari to everybody who would want to have an pleasing, enjoyable moment in a wonderful place. Thanks a lot to everybody there"
September 2017,Terrific London hotel,"Stayed at the Hari for the first time earlier this month. Loved this place, friendly staff (even sent a free glass of wine up to my room), very cool room with great bed, awecome bathroom with a GREAT shower, multiple electric outlets (with US, UK and Euro plugs) and USB ports at the work surface, a nice little couch at the window with motorized shades, etc.   Good location in upscale area of Belgravia, very posh neighborhood."
September 2017,Perfection !,Fantastic stay with lots of personal touches and everything was perfect from the moment we arrived.   The food and drinks have been well thought out and served to a high standard with a prompt efficient service   The team are friendly and very welcoming   All the small touches made our stay perfect can‚Äôt wait to return 
August 2017,Great service!,"I stayed a week in this great boutique hotel. It's a great hotel all around. But the service of the front desk team was superb (Thank you, Cesar!).   From check in to check out, the staff's service was above expectation ‚Äî professionalism, friendliness, attention to details, knowledge about the area, great recommendations for activities etc.   The hotel is also located in a good location between Sloane Square and Hyde Park, Great places to walk or bike around."
August 2017,Excellent Hotel in every way,"We spent a long weekend in London at The Hari to celebrate my wife‚Äôs birthday.  Everything was great.  The staff is lovely and so accommodating. While I was making the reservation I ran into a snag and Nicole at the front desk called me in the states to sort it all out.  Once we got to The Hari all of the staff matched that level of helpfulness and we found a bottle of champagne chilling in our room.  We were in 904, which has a small balcony (I was able to fit a small chair on it!) and overlooks the park.  The bathroom is well outfitted with a shower/tub and a separate w/c.  The bed was wonderfully comfortable.  I do wish, as I find in many hotels, there were more drawers in which to unpack.  We got extra hangers and the problem was solved.  The hotel‚Äôs location in Belgrade‚Äôs,‚Ä¶"
August 2017,Lovely Boutique Hotel,"I had a wonderful 6-night stay at The Hari. They managed to meet my request for an early check in (at 9am) after a 14-hour overnight flight, which was a most lovely start to my stay. Throughout my stay, the room was kept very clean and neat, and i was most delighted with the daily packets of different types of sweets/candy/chocolates that were sent up each evening. The service is also warm and friendly, with all staff (from reception to cleaners) giving friendly greetings whenever we meet. I also loved the location, Knightsbridge, which is super convenient to get to anywhere. And being located in a rather quiet (but still conveniently located) neighbourhood, i could get quiet rest at night, without being disturbed by traffic noise or rowdy drunk people (which i've encountered‚Ä¶"
June 2017,"Beautiful hotel, nice staff but room disappointed","This is a beautiful hotel, with a great location, and a very friendly and helpful staff. However, my friend and I found the room a sub par experience. First of all, the lighting was way too dim. But the worst part was there was nowhere to easily dry and style our hair. I understand that you can't have an electrical outlet in the bathroom for a hair dryer. That's true most places in Europe. But most other hotels I've stayed in provide an area with a mirror and outlet where you can easily accomplish your daily routine. At Hari, we had to ask for an extension cord to plug the hair dryer in on the wall outside the bathroom so we could use the one wall mirror in the room across from the bathroom. It was very difficult to dry our hair. And I would prefer not to look at myself in a‚Ä¶"
August 2017,Form over Function,"I liked the overall feeling of the hotel - great design, very friendly and outgoing staff and wonderful location.  While the design was great, the function wasn't so great.  There wasn't enough space in the room for our things - I think that people who design hotel rooms should be asked to stay in them for a few nights!  I ended up using the window sill as a shelf/drawer. The bathroom also looked nice however the shower head was placed so that I couldn't stand under it without hitting the wall or the shelf with the shampoo.  And the lighting looked great but made it impossible to shave.  "
August 2017,Wonderful long weekend,"From the moment we arrived to our departure the service was second to none. Check in was seamless the room fabulous and the food exquisite. All the staff members where extremely knowledgeable,helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble for them . I celebrated my birthday that weekend, they provided a fabulous cake and the personal touches throughout the weekend where unexpected but very welcome. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and would not think twice about staying again."
August 2017,Outstanding Hotel | 6 Star Experience,"This is our second visit to this hotel, previously it was part of the Thompson Hotel Group. The Hari is an outstanding hotel located in the up-market suburb of Belgravia which is close to Knightsbridge. Our welcome back to the hotel was very impressive including a beautiful bottle of champagne. The rooms are modern, clean and well equipped. The beds are very comfortable and the turn-down service each evening was a lovely touch. All the staff made us feel very welcomed and nothing was too much trouble. If you are after a special hotel experience, you can‚Äôt look past the Hari. Thanks to the Front Desk, Conceirge, Doormen and Cleaning Staff for a another outstanding stay at this hotel. TG&DD"
June 2017,great London hotel in Belgravia,great London hotel with great staff and room. close to all shopping on Sloane st. free welcome drinks and coffee and very nice bar on the roof that you can smoke cigars which are not many in London. one of the best bedroom set up not seem in many European hotel in this level  
August 2017,"Beautiful hotel, first rate service","We stayed at the Hari for our first visit to London with our daughter and son-in-law.  All four of us agreed that the hotel was beautiful and the service was impeccable.  The front desk staff lept immediately into helping us solve a problem unrelated to them and the concierge service was exceptional, helping us make arrangements around town and even scoring a reservation for us at a one of the hottest 'full' restaurants on London.  We ate at the Hari's own restaurant 3 times for breakfast and twice for dinner.  Excellent! Can't say enough good things about the Hari.  A minor draw back is that the guest rooms are somewhat dimly lit but when we return to London, this is where we will stay."
August 2017,Another fabulous weekend break at The Hari,"We have previously had a fantastic stay at The Hari so decided it would be a good choice for our recent weekender and what a good choice it was. From the time we arrived we were made to feel special and we couldn't find fault with any member of staff we met. Everyone was cheerful, relaxed and friendly and anticipated our needs. Many hotels of this calibre can be aloof...not at the Hari, London. Our room was fantastic with a wonderful window seat overlooking the tree lined street. It was immaculate, very comfortable and quiet. The turn down service provided lovely sweet treats...top marks to housekeeping :) We had dinner in the hotel's Italian restaurant and again we had a great evening with good food, wine and service. Hopefully, we will soon return to the Hari for another‚Ä¶"
August 2017,There is no words to describe how wonderful is the hotel,I advise everyone to stay at the Hari . this hotel is the best in Lonodn . I have stayed there many times during summer . since 2011  every summer I noticed that the hotel is improving and they have the best hospitality service to their guest .  The staff are amazing from the doorman to the Manager who welcome me back by sending a letter to my room with desert .
July 2017,Disappointed,"On arriving at the hotel the concierge and receptionist were very polite and helpful although our rooms were not ready, we were early, they took our bags and said they would phone when the room was ready. We had a missed call from the hotel at 16.06,We went off to explore and on return to the hotel around 5.30 a different receptionist was not very helpful and seemed confused over our booking. We got the keys for both rooms and the porter then fetched our bags we were surprised they had not been already taken up. On arrival in the rooms we discovered they weren't interconnecting which we had telephoned to check on earlier in the week and been told they would be connecting. The reception was not very helpful, and rambled on about only been told from booking. Com today at 2 that we‚Ä¶"
September 2017,Hidden gem in a fabulous location ,"Love this boutique hotel! I only got to stay one night as part of a business/leisure trip but wish I could have stayed longer.  The decor is very nice, the bedrooms are fairly small as is normal for London but they are well set out and spotless. The concierge knew I was going for a run the next morning and recommended a juice for when I got back. Sure enough, I returned and room service delivered the juice complimentary - fantastic personalised touch, thank you Ricardo!  The rest of the team were excellent and I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. The location is brilliant, within walking distance to Sloane Street, Harrods, Hyde Park and bus/tube.  I will definitely be back. "
September 2017,Fantastic Wimbledon Trip,"I recently stayed at The Hari for my trip to Wimbledon and did not know what to expect as I booked my whole trip including my hotel via a tour group.  I am accustomed to staying in mostly 5 star hotels and I will tell you The Hari hotel was amazing.  The service was exceptional - the concierge staff arranged everything from airport transfers to hair appointments and were very prompt in responding to all of my requests.  The doormen and bellmen were extremely polite and always provided me with directions to everything from a local hangout to a preferred jogging route.  The room service was excellent and always timely.  While I did not eat in the restaurant, I often had appetizers and drinks in the bar area and the service was outstanding.  The rooms were modern and very‚Ä¶"
September 2017,Amazing stay and great staff!,"I've stayed at The Hari in London already a couple of times on a business trip and I absolutely loved it!! The Staff go out of their way to ensure you have a fabulous stay at this hotel. From the greetings at the door (I believe it was Ricardo) to the welcome at the restaurant, the people at this hotel really make the difference. Elena and Gianni at the restaurant were tremendous hosts and they advised on a great risotto with seafood! Also the room was very charming and with a wonderful view. Last but not least, the cocktails at the bar were delicious. Alessandro is the master behind the bar and he knows his job really well (not only in terms of good drinks, but it is also a pleasure looking at his choreography when preparing it!). Thank you all for the great stay! See you next‚Ä¶"
September 2017,Great stay,Everything was perfect. Woul highly recommend everyone who comes to London to stay here.  The staffs attention  to detail is great.  Really good location if u want to be near everything.  Rooms were very nice inside
August 2017,Overnight stay for a birthday celebration.,"The Hari was an ideal choice for an overnight stay for a birthday celebration in London. The room we had was spacious, of an excellent standard and was very quiet and restful. This was complemented by a large, very comfortable bed.The modern bathroom was a good size and had quality complimentary toiletries. Like many other reviewers, the stand out feature of this hotel, for me, is the attentiveness of the staff. Nothing was too much trouble. From the moment you walk into the hotel everyone is there to help and ensure that you get the best possible experience - including members of the management team, who are often not visible in larger establishments. We had a most enjoyable stay and will definitely return."
September 2017,Enjoyable Stay at The Hari,The Staff at The Hari in London go out of their way to ensure you have a fabulous stay at this hotel.  You are greeted at the door by the smiling Doorman and walk into a spacious and appealing foyer.  At reception they will try their best to cater for your needs.  The room was clean and lovely.  The bed was comfy and restful.  The bathroom is not overly large but was clean with a large shower.   We had drinks at the bar and we were offered a antipasto plate complimentary with our drinks. It was delicious.  We did not dine at this hotel but found a gorgeous cafe for breakfast just down the road.  The location worked well for Us as it was just a little bit away from the main hustle & bustle. But walking distance to Harrods and lots of shopping. We would be happy to return to The‚Ä¶
August 2017,Excellent weekend night,"Had a wonderful time at the Hari ! I spent a night for a special night with my family and everything was perfect. The room was beautiful, the staff really kind and attentive. The emplacement is perfect, in the heart of Belgravia. This hotel is a really welcoming place that I will definitely recommend !!"
August 2017,Beyond Expectations,"Just returned from a fabulous 2 night stay at The Hari.  Having normally leaned towards the 'bigger brand' name hotel, this came as a complete surprise, and the level of service that we received was second to none.  From the concierge contacting us personally beforehand, a few days prior to arrival, to the late check out granted to us when departing- everything ran smoothly.  All staff that we encountered were superb!  At check in (where they greeted us by name before we even told them), to the incredible welcome gifts for my three year old daughter (and champagne for us) when we went to our room, these touches made the stay incredibly memorable for us, and we will be sure to return without a doubt.  The whole team there take an immense pride in their work which was reflected in‚Ä¶"
June 2017,Great first impression!,"This review is a copy of the email that I sent to the hotel's General Manager after my stay:  I recently had the pleasure of staying a the Hari for a week while I was in London on a business trip.  I travel to London a few times a year and like to check out the different preferred hotels in our company‚Äôs program.  On past visits I‚Äôve stayed at the St. James, Goring and Mondrian.  To be honest, I fell in love with the Mondrian earlier this year and thought it would be my default hotel for future visits.  Our office is at Canary Wharf so you can‚Äôt beat the location.   However, on my trip last month I stayed for 7 nights at the Hari.  I was intrigued by the extremely positive TripAdvisor reviews.    I don‚Äôt usually write an email to the General Manager after a stay but wanted to‚Ä¶"
May 2017,Magnificent Boutique Hotel in heart of London,"I have been coming to the Hari (formerly The Belgraves) for a few years now and absolutely love this intimate boutique hotel, which i clearly consider my home in London, and has been getting better and better. From the second I enter the beautiful, art filled lobby, every single staff member is polite, gracious and goes the distance to make me feel welcome and proactively respond to all my needs. Rooms are well sized, extremely conformable, stylish and it is very easy & intuitive to use everything. Bathrooms are specklessly clean and i must say i really enjoy the Noble Isle Bathroom amenities. Beside the bed there is a small portable Handy Phone with free local and international calls, internet and 3G for us to use throughout their stay, and this is really useful! The free Wifi‚Ä¶"
June 2017,An amazing Gem of a hotel in Knightsbridge ,"I stayed at The Hari for business. What a great stay I had. The welcome from the concierge at the door was warm and friendly and the two guys who checked me in really knew their stuff and were very polite and friendly.   Great room. Funky and cool with the most comfortable bed.   The restaurant rocked great food and drinks served by a trendy Barman and waiter.   Checking out today it was raining and cold so I was offered a warm coffee to go and then I was offered an umbrella but I said no as I wasn't returning and he said no problem you can take one, nice touch.   A really good stay and I would really recommend it for anyone visiting london for business or leisure. "
June 2017,"Fabulous welcome , fantastic hotel",Great location  great staff. Jack the bellman welcome us by out name!!! We where impresed  from the beggining!!! The receptionist was very nice aswell Charlie i belive. We where there  for my birthday and she knew and she  welcome me with happy birthday! The room was  clean and welcoming. We found a botlle of champagne and a good cake and in the plate was written  happy birthday!!! We went down  to the italian  restaurant where Giampiero seat us and made our evening excelent.   Thank you Hari team for everything.  I will stay again here for sure!!! 
June 2017,Beautiful and Mesmerizing,"I was first greeted by charlie, the beautiful woman at the counter after witnessing an authentic and lavish reception room. A perfect start to my hotel experience which i must say was wonderful. The rooms, the staff and most of all the service and food was exceptional. If i was lucky enough to have business in the area again i know who i will be booking my room with."
May 2017,Home away from Home,"The Hari is and will always be my preferred hotel in London. The location is excellent, the staffs are simply out of this world (Brilliant). It is our home away from home; even my 2 year old daughter acts as such. "
June 2017,Hotel experience,"The rooms are very stylish, but small. The shower door in our suite wasn't tight and after taking a shower we had lots of water on the floor. Bed was very comfortable, hotel is in the heart of London's best area. Nice restaurant downstairs. Staff is very friendly and helpful. "
May 2017,Would have liked more time,This was a 1 night stay and unfortunately we had little time to explore the hotel.  I found the hotel very pleasant a great room well  equipped  All the staff were very helpful.  Only minor issue was that the hotel was a bit warm for us
June 2017,The staff of the hotel is really treasure,The hotel rooms is nice and clean as any 5 stars hotel the location is one of top in London but the really treasure they have is the personal they work at the hotel I mean all the staff from the bell boy to house keepers and in between like the reception the room service and the people in nicely restaurant plus they have the best donuts you could have in London at the hotel cafe I enjoyed with my family all moments there and I Strongly recommend these hotel and will voting for hari to best hotel in London 2017
June 2017,Perfect in every way,"I booked this hotel for my boyfriends 21st birthday and it was the best present he said he could have asked for! I chose this hotel based on its location and great reviews and it didnt disappoint. From the minute we arrived we were made to feel so welcome and every member of staff we met was so friendly!  I mentioned it was my boyfriends birthday when bookingp and when we arrived there was a cake,champagne and balloons in the room...we were blown away with the effort they went to to make our stay special.  Everything was spotlessly clean and breakfast was superb.   Thank you, we will definitely be returning!"
September 2017,Hari london,"This is my first time visiting London. The Hari London definitely made our stay very special. The glorious staff members are there to help. The service is very attentive from check in to check out. Every evening our room was turn down, I love to come back to a beautiful room after a long day of sightseeing.  The location is great; neighborhood is so quiet and safe. Very close to transportation. Definitely recommend to stay @ the Hari London "
May 2017,A gem of a hotel,"Located in a quiet neighborhood area of Belgravia, this great hotel is located between the Sloane Park & Knightsbridge station allowing you an easy walk to either line that connects to multiple major destinations around town. We chose to stay here to ease ourselves into London after a very long flight and are so glad we did! The hotel room was beautiful with fantastic views, the staff very accommodating and informative and the ambience charming. The rooms are very new and modern with great upgrades like US plugs already installed and the Handy phone - a wonderful gadget that gives travelers free local data for phone calls and maps - a lifeline to protect us from going into overage charges.  Tip: Ask for a higher floor for a great view of the city!"
September 2017,London retreat,"Great to be back at the Hair, very attentive staff, if was only a flying visit but managed a drink in the new ground floor bar, great atmosphere. Next time we will get to dine in the intalian restaurant menu looks fab! "
August 2017,Great stay at The Hari,"I really liked my stay at The Hari, the location is great and the staff is really very nice and welcoming. Loved the Hotel¬¥s atmosphere and the comfortable room. The bikes that the Hotel offers free of charge enabled us to experience the city in the best way possible. Special note to the Hotel¬¥s restaurant and Bar ""Il Pampero"" - Really good Italian food and a very friendly Italian (and Portuguese) staff. Will definitely return."
September 2017,"Amazing staff, beautiful stay, tasty food","I stayed for one night in the Hari in the Penthouse suite (I'll get onto the room later). The hotel, is modern, choc and fabulous, it has a laid-back luxury vibe that's certinaly not stuffy/snobby. The staff are so friendly an willing to help - Hattie and Stefano in partocular are so personable and easy to talk to. The staff really make the stay so comfortable and almost like a second home.   The restaurant is the perfect Italian restaurant . The setting is great, but the food is incredible. I've dined at a lot of 'posh' restaurants in London and I find it hard to find a great Italian but Il Pompero is that.   The room was to die for. Balconies with incredible views of London and the interior design was so fabulous.  I couldn't have asked for a better stay - the perfect place‚Ä¶"
September 2017,Excellent hotel and service,"This beautiful hotel is in a great location, within walking distance to Harrods and the Hyde Park. The area feels safe and even safe enough to get the hotel bikes and bike to Hyde Park. Fantastic way to see the park. The staff were all very attentive and professional but still personal. The hotel bar service was excellent. the room was small however had all the required fittings."
September 2017,Italian Food to Die For and Cocktails of Dreams,"Wow wow and wow this place is unreal and part of me does not want to let anyone else know about it. Cocktails of such creation, Italian food to die for and having an Italian partner I class myself as informed. The staff make you feel like family not a paying guest. In the words of Alessandro the best barman in London if you come to my house why would I not serve you the best drinks and prepare the best food. It's a must place and the best Cacio e Pepe outside of Roma."
September 2017,"Great location, wonderful staff!","I have stayed at The Hari hotel a couple of times, and each time has been a fantastic experience. They have great customer service - I have often requested to stay in the same room (high floor, with view of the garden outside), and the hotel has accomodated my request each time.   The location of the hotel is perfect - it is just minutes away from Harvey Nichols and Harrods. The hotel and rooms are also designed beautifully, and the bar/lounge area is great for meeting with friends and family. What remains outstanding however, is the staff. Warm, friendly and helpful.  This is the best hotel in London, and I look forward to coming back."
September 2017,Nice Hotel,"Nice hotel, Staff is very helpful and friendly. The hotel are in the heart of Belgravia, It's close to Sloane Square, Kings Rd and Brompton Rd. They have a small gym, nice restaurant. There are stable wirless internet access."
September 2017,Fantastic stay,We had a wonderful stay in The Hari and we booked another stay in that hotel for the end of the year. Fir us it is the best hitel in London and the staff is incredibely friendly . A very specual thanks to Joanna! 
June 2017,Best stay in London,"A great hotel, in an unbeatable location, topped with lovely warm hospitality from our hosts. We were spoilt by the team's generosity - checking in at 8am straight off a flight we were taken straight to our room. And the service stayed that way through our stay. The hotel really indulged my 9 year old son, so his expectations are now sky high! A luxurious and cool hotel - in a contemporary and unshowy way. Really world class. "
June 2017,Beautiful hotel with an awesome service,"We got to the hotel by coincide as we had to look for a place to stay overnight due to the big incident with British airways.  The hotel interior is very nice and impressive. When we arrived at the hotel, totally exhausted and frustrated, the concierge was very caring and offered us a glass of champagne immediately and made us feel comfortable and forget the stress about the incident with ease and gave us extra an exclusive room. He personally guided us to the room and showed us the accommodations. Even later at night when we've had some trouble with the phone, he came to our room within some minutes to help us out. Overall a great experience."
June 2017,Fine Stay,"The deluxe room we were booked in was very small for 2 people. The quality of room and the staff were wonderful. However, the upstairs bar and lounge were virtually inaccessible to guests later in the evening and you had to book a table in advance - that was a turn off especially if you wanted an after dinner drink. It has location going for it but we would elect to stay at another hotel next time."
June 2017,"Lovely hotel, fantastic staff","We have stayed at The Hari twice now, and both times we couldn't fault it. From the amazing welcome at reception, to the comfortable rooms and the lovely breakfast.  The is a really popular bar on the first floor and great restaurant on the ground floor  Brilliant location. Great Staff"
June 2017,The Hari,"for me, the location is ideal: in belgravia near sloane square and knightsbridge. The only issue I have with this hotel is that it can be a VERY popular hangout for locals in the evenings-and has the same atmosphere as a nightclub; which can be annoying if your wanting a quiet bite or drink after being out all day-too risky to use as a meeting point for a drink as you will most-likely be turned away."
June 2017,Felt like home!,"We had the best experience at The Hari. The rooms are not big, but are very comfortable and quiet, with great firm mattresses and amazing linen. But the very best is the staff. They truly care about the guests and do everything to make our stay more pleasurable. One morning I praised the staff about the delicious pastries served every night. Guess what they surprised me with? A box of pastries to take home with me. We loved The Hari."
June 2017,Perfect place,Really nice hotel in the heart of Belgravia. Lot of amenities including a mobile phone to be used during your stay. You can borrow a bike here. This turned my day in a perfect evening biking in Hyde park and reaching the restaurant by bike. Everybody has been lovely in the hotel. Definitely a place to be.
June 2017,Very nice experience,"The Hotel is very nice, the staff is professional, and they made me feel as a I was home. Very nice experience, very convenient location and warmly greeted. I will reccommend this Hotel and I will use also for my private trip"
June 2017,Excellent service - went above and beyond,"I booked a very last minute one-night stay here for last Saturday night. I actually live very close by but I was looking for a change of scenery for my husband and I after we got some bad news this week. Having got a very good deal on booking.com, I wanted to ensure we didn't end up in a bad room (as is unfortunately often the case), so I contacted the hotel before our arrival to make a few requests (high floor, quiet room, view etc.). The response I got from the hotel, particularly the head of guest services, was almost overwhelming. We were taken care of in a way I haven't really experienced before... and we have stayed in some pretty nice places in our time. Hats off to this city hotel for providing a personal touch you don't often see in city hotels. The room, while not‚Ä¶"
June 2017,Quick Layover,This modern hotel is in an excellent central location close to Sloane Square.  The room was clean and functional.  The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.  The breakfast as decent if not exceptional.  
June 2017,Home Away From Home,"Staying at the Hari was like finding a ""new home""!!!  Everyone from the front doorman to the concierge (and everyone in between) was so inviting and welcoming and warm!  They went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed.....including a birthday celebration for my fiance!  Amazing place to stay.....you never want to leave!"
May 2017,Best hotel in London,"I looked both on airbnb and various hotel sites and kept coming back to the Hari, so I booked it. The hotel was roughly the same price as the airbnbs in the area. Having selected the latter last visit, we were so glad we had the opportunity to check out this fantastic boutique hotel. It was the best stay we've had in our many trips to London.   The service was amazing, all staff were so helpful and attentive.   The room was small but that's London. It was beautifully furnished. We had a cute little balcony with great views across London. The bed was super comfy and the room so quiet. The bathroom was marble and also very tasteful. It's going to be my  go to every time I visit London. "
May 2017,Pleasant stay at a pleasant place,"We did enjoy our stay from the very beginning to the very end. The ambiance of this place thrives on its stylish yet subtle interior design, on the room fragrances , the flower decor and modern paintings, and, most important, on the friendliness and extreme positive attitude of The Hari Team. We knew beforehand that the rooms were not very big, but their interior design is top (except: we do prefer showers to bath tubs). The location is perfect in Belgravia, a high level residential area, bus, tube and good restaurants are within tolerable walking distance, and Knightsbridge with Harrods, Harvey Nichols, other major department stores and high end fashion boutiques is a 15 mn walk away. If you are on the lookout for busier places South Kensington and Sloane Square are close. If‚Ä¶"
May 2017,"Excellent hotel in London, great location, amazing customer service! Highly recommended!","Lovely charming hotel, very well located (walking distance from Knightsbridge), excellent service. We have been warmly welcomed and, despite the late hours, we could still have dinner in the Italian restaurant (nice food!); room has the ""London"" sizes however the king size bed makes the difference. Rooms are equipped as in a 5stars hotel (you have everything you need for a short or long stay). It worth to underline the high level of service provided: the staff, and I really mean all of them, are amazing! Everything was simply perfect and they really made our stay memorable! Highly recommended."
May 2017,50th birthday ,"Just finished a weekend here for my wife and her twin sisters 50th birthday. We cannot fault this hotel in any. From the moment you arrive the experience is just perfect. There's none of the tourist nonsense with overdressed doormen or super trendy shoreditch posing with over trendy staff and ridiculously dark rooms.  The hotel is modern, the rooms large and clean, the beds super comfy, shower and bath amazing, food gorgeous but most of all the staff are friendly, polite and efficient. the best hotel experience  I've had in a very long time. "
May 2017,Highly recommended!,"We have just returned from my first ever visit to London and was fortunate enough to stay in a few of London's most famous hotels. We ended my London trip with The Hari and although we had not heard of this property previously we had heard and read some great reviews. Well, needless to say we were not disappointed! From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were simply pampered beyond belief. Our stay was curated by the wonderful Joanna who looked after our every need and desire. Our welcome amenities were thought-out and unique including the ever so delicious locally baked cronuts! Yummy! The room and furnishings were well designed and arranged and clearly every detail had be thought through. There were thoughtful surprises everywhere we turned in the room. The bath‚Ä¶"
May 2017,Choose Hari!,This hotel is a gem! The staff is amazing in a day they know you by name and make you feel like you are their most important customer.The location is excellent ;we walked to almost everything we wanted to see. I would stay there again in a heart beat. 
May 2017,The Hari Suite is Spectacular,"I travel frequently on business to London and some of the meetings can bring on unnecessary anxiety.  I arrived on a 6:30 morning flight, had to get ready at the airport to attend a 8:30 meeting in Mayfair.  The meeting was excruciatingly painful, but to my surprise, when I arrived to the Hotel Hari at about 6:30 pm I was greeted with a great surprise that I had been upgraded to the Hari Suite and the issues that I was having during the day, totally disappeared.  The Suite, designed by Tara Bernerd is an understated, comfortable sitting room and separate bedroom with powder room, free-standing bar, fireplace and small balconettes.  The coloration of the fabrics are a series of sophisticated jewel tones and luxurious velvets.  The master bathroom was generous and well appointed. ‚Ä¶"
May 2017,Superb Stay ,This was first time we stayed at The Hari London and what a fantastic stay it was. The rooms are extremely well equipped and very comfortable. They have a great bar and terrace on the first floor. The staff are extremely helpful and make you feel right at home. Breakfast is also fantastic unlike many other other hotels in London.   The hotel is located in one of the nicest spots in London and walking distance to many London attractions. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anybody travelling on business or leisure. We will definitely be back.   
May 2017,Deserves its good ratings,"THe Hari Hotel deserves its good ratings.  Fabulous location, thoughtful and attentive staff, comfortable, well appointed and elegant room and on top of all that in our room was a cellular phone we were welcome to call home on and use all around London.   A very appreciated perk."
April 2017,Morning of my Wedding,"The Hari looked after me and my family in a way I could only have dreamed about! I called them in advance of my stay to say I would be using the hotel to get ready for my wedding. From that moment onwards I received 5 star treatment! I checked in early  the day before my wedding (around 12pm, with no prior notice). Upon arrival the staff at the Reception desk were so excited to meet me and offered me a drink in the lobby whilst my room was been prepared! They told me they had a surprise for me: The surprise was an amazing room upgrade! My sister and her husband were allocated a room next to mine. My room had a fireplace, drinks bar, Marble bathroom and beautiful views of London. It was the perfect room to get ready in prior to my wedding. There was even a bottle of champagne‚Ä¶"
March 2017,Great boutique property,Wonderful staff who provide warm and efficient service. Everyone was so helpful from the moment I stepped out of my uber. I also like the area which is quiet yet close to everything. Easy walk or uber to everything I needed. Only complaint is the lighting system in the room. Could use some dimmers but not a deal breaker at all!
May 2017,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"This is a great small hotel in a great location in Knightsbridge. it is literally 5 minutes walk from Harrods and Harvey Nicholls stores and all the designer shops in Sloane Street. We were visiting the Chelsea Flower Show and again the hotel was very close being a twenty minute walk. The hotel itself is very nicely fitted out although as with most London hotels the rooms are not huge. However, we had a premium king room on the fifth floor and is was very nice and a reasonable size. Wifi was included free.   The hotel had a very nice restaurant 'Il Pampero' which was excellent. Good food and good service. Similarly, breakfast which was not included was freshly cooked and to a very nice standard and again service was good. We had a drink in the first floor bar most evenings and‚Ä¶"
May 2017,The Hari Hotel,"The Hari has it all: great room, outstanding service, centrally located, fantastic staff, the best, most experienced and helpful Concierge we have ever had the pleasure to work with. Oh, and by the way, the best.shower.ever. Ten nights of comfort and convenience. We will always stay at The Hari when in London."
March 2017,Loved our stay!,"Bathtub!  Personal controlled AC!  Room service!  Comfy bed!  All top on our list.  Loved the area, loved the staff, everything was clean, lovely, easy and a great little cocktail bar too.  I will be back.  I was visiting my daughter who is studying abroad and we both enjoyed our stay.  Wonderful little places to eat close by too.  And room service was available too."
April 2017,Great hotel in great neighborhood.,"The British hospitality in it's best, we stay there 3 nights and joy every moment, super profetional stuff, they take care of you like you are the only one at the hotel, rooms are sparkling clean and roomy, we travel alots around the world, this is definitely on our top 10....!!!!"
May 2017,The Hari,"The hotel is beautifully decorated and our room was lovely too. Staff were attentive, friendly and helpful. We ate in the restaurant too, again lovely staff and beautifully decorated, food was lovely."
April 2017,Great hotel,"Big welcome, knowledgeable & helpful staff. Compact site but everything was there-intimate terrace, good Italian restaurant, well appointed lounge-sitting room-bar area where groups could socialize also small nooks for quiet reading."
May 2017,Exceptional service!,"Spent four days at The Hari and were very impressed by the exceptional service. Unfortunately, I lost my Iphone in a cab but the outstanding concierge, Ben, went out of his way to help locate it and have it shipped to our next destination in England. Rare have I seen such a high level of service. Rooms, lobby and decor were equally noteworthy!"
May 2017,Faultless ,My husband and I have just left this hotel after an overnight stay and it is was with  a heavy heart as we checked out.  Having never dreamt id stay in Belgravia  ( always thinking it was above our every day normal working couples budget lol) i stumbled upon the London Hari. As it was a special occasion  I decided to up my budget and stay In this 325 per night room. Most friends thought I was mad as this neither included dinner or breakfast. In arrival we thought the entrance to the hotel was stunning and the staff immediately on entering polite and helpful. Our room wasn't ready as we had  arrived at 10 am ( early flight) our cases were stored and we went out exploring. When  we arrived back we found that our room had been upgraded due to it being our anniversary and also‚Ä¶
May 2017,van A-Z alles in perfectie. Led by artists of hospitality!The best in London!,"Zeer professionele check in en ontvangst.Perfect art of Welcome. High room comfort, hoge standard materialen, prachtig design, very professional service in all sences.Alles in de puntjes en details verzorgd. The Hari is a masterpiece of perfect hospitality, all the staff where driven with passion.It is an expression of love by the hotelier who above all else cherish giving themselves to others. Centrale locatie in de beste wijk. Nogmaals : for those who travel to discover something more seek the remarkably uncommon at the Hari in London. The Hari creates oases where you feel completely at home, while enabling you to move beyond your comfort zone to discover the unexpected."
May 2017,Another great stay!,"We recently enjoyed another great stay and this time we took advantage of the restaurant.  The hotel was, as always, spotlessly clean, the bar service was delivered with the usual passion and style and the restaurant delivered in bounds with a fresh and well balanced menu. The food was delicious and was matched with a generous wine cellar.  All in all, 'another great stay'....we'll be back very soon!!"
May 2017,Great hotel and quiet (and very safe) location,"I've stayed here several times (work and pleasure) and have not had a bad experience.  It's a little away from the hustle of Central London, so it might not be for everyone.  But, if you want to stay at a nice hotel that's in a quiet and safe neighborhood, you can't go wrong with the Hari."
May 2017,Stylish hotel in a great location ,"We stayed in the Hari for 3 nights. The hotel is tastefully fit out. The room is compact but very comfy. Location is great, close to a lot of Luxury shops and fine restaurants. It took us only 15 minutes' walk to Harrods and 13 minutes to the Five Fields, for fantastic fine dining. We also dined on some nice neighbourhood restaurants on King's road, which are again around 20 minutes' walk distance.  All in all, lovely stay. We will definitely stay in the Hari again when we come back to London."
May 2017,WONDERFUL STAY AT THE HARI,"From the moment we checked in to checking out, we were greeted with very experienced and helpful and courteous and warm smiles. Many thanks to evwryone at The Hari for making our stay a memorable one."
April 2017,Just Perfect!,"I've had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for six nights. During my stay, from the check-in all the way till check-out, everything about this hotel was amazing. The staff are extremely friendly and hospitable. the room was prepared and cleaned continuously (2-times a day). The location of the hotel was just the icing on the cake, as all my personal points of interest were close by and within walking distance. I'll surely stay at this hotel in the future. Superb hotel *****"
May 2017,The hari,This was my first stay at the hari. As I use to visit the hotel laounge before . The location is just 10min walk to Harrods so it's an excellent location. Quite a few steps from some nice restaurants and coffee shops . I recommend this hotel as the room was nice. Clean. Comfortable.  And the overall experience was good 
May 2017,Exquisite hotel with fantastic service,"We stayed at the Hari Hotel at the end of April to celebrate my 25th Birthday in London. Not only does the Hotel offer excellent service but also is situated very centrally near the underground stations Knightsbridge, Sloane Square and South Kensington. We had a great time and will for sure return soon."
May 2017,Hidden Jewel!,"The over all experience was excellent. I have stayed here in the past but it seems like it has improved under the new management. Very friendly and helpful staff, amazing rooms, excellent location , sumptuous breakfast made my short stay very enjoyable. Another big plus was the complimentary local cell phone, did not get to use much of it but seemed like a very good incentive for people on a short stay."
November 2016,Superb!,"Contemporary, sexy and offering the warmest of welcomes The Hari is a little gem of a hotel tucked away in Belgravia. The whole staff seems to believe the mantra that ""Nothing is too much trouble"" and, as a result, the service is impeccable. While you are there do try the new restaurant il Pampero, it's excellent!"
March 2017,What a find !!,"We stumbled upon the Hari Restaurant - Il Pampero - by chance; the Rib Room at the Carlton Towers being unexpectedly closed and we were searching around after an exhausting Chelsea Flower Show day. We had no prior booking, but at 8.45 pm the greeting was welcoming and we were promptly seated despite the restaurant being very busy. All the staff were exceptionally friendly, professional and efficient. The food was excellent with strong Italian overtones.The furnishings are modern and warm, the ambiance lovely.The atmosphere is very relaxing. We loved everything about the place - it was very good and we thoroughly recommend it, even though expensive"
March 2017,Best hotel service I ever received!,"My husband and I stayed at the Hari May 8 through May 15, 2017.  They exceeded our expectations with their friendly staff and hotel amenities.  We ended most evenings with a glass of wine at their restaurant bar because the bartenders were so sociable.  We totally appreciated their complimentary smart phone with free internet..  The treats left on our beds each night were incredible!  Everyone was exceptionally attentive from the front desk to the doorman.  We will be back again as soon as we replenish our vacation fund!"
March 2017,Value for your money!,"This is a fantastic hotel close to both Knightsbridge and Sloan square tube station. It is walking distance from Hyde Park and Harrods. Sloan street is a beautiful shopping street that is also close by. The Hotel itself provide excellent customer service, the front desk staff is extremely friendly and helpful and so are all the staff. The restaurant offers great food and the staff advised us off the card with delicious specials, again the service here is excellent. In the morning you can have an excellent breakfast in the same restaurant where you can order several additions. The rooms are spacious and the turn down service is outstanding. The hotel staff has an excellent eye for detail which include a complimentary bottle of water every day (one per person staying). The beds‚Ä¶"
March 2017,Fantastic location!,Right in the heart of the beautiful and quiet Belgravia streets. It's the ideal place to stay in London and well placed for the Chelsea Flower Show which was our reason for staying. Very friendly and helpful staff. Cannot really fault it! 
March 2017,"Nice, quiet, very good service","Great experience at the Hari, despite a couple of glitches, which were quickly fixed. Our room was quite small, but well designed & efficient. We had a temporary Internet outage for a few hours, and a glitch with the house phone that wouldn't stop beeping, but the professional staff were very good in clearing things up, and also very helpful when we lost our mobile phone. Hotel is very quiet, yet centrally located. Would definitely go back."
March 2017,Amazing Jewel in a Sea of Shells - Stay Here and You'll Never want to leave!,"Amazing Jewel in a Sea of Shells - Stay Here and You'll Never want to leave!  Why do I say this?  Because it is so true!  As a frequent business traveler, you want a few things:  A comfortable, clean bed/room to sleep in, a quiet hallway, great wifi and amazing customer service.  To be honest, I am usually happy with 2 out of the 4.  NO hotel...I mean not one, has ever managed to do all these things - and more...until I stayed at the Hari.  What an amazing experience.  The staff was so welcoming since the moment I arrived.  My room was not ready, but they quickly took my bags, gave me a drink and told me to relax.  They offered to let me know via phone if I wanted to go shop (BONUS:  this place is closely located to some of the best shopping in the world).  I opted to relax in‚Ä¶"
March 2017,What a gem!,"Great location, gave us accesses to Knightsbridge and Sloane Square on different lines. Gets you almost anywhere. Rooms were cosy and every detail was thought through (like having enough space for toiletries in the bathroom). Staffs made me feel welcomed whenever I get back and anything we asked through concierge or housekeeping, was provided for without any delay. In fact, when we asked for ice, they delivered so quick, we couldn't believe ourselves. That made us feel special although it was a mere simple request. Will def return when I'm back in London."
March 2017,Excellent hotel in good location,"Regarding our 7-day stay at the Hari... Quiet but convenient location: Sloan Square tube station, restaurants, shopping all within a 15 minute walk. All staff are exceptionally pleasant and helpful. Had a King Deluxe room--very nicely done and includes a free cell phone (mobile) so you can avoid paying the ridiculous international phone fees. On-site restaurant (Il Pompero: high end Italian) and mezzanine level bar both very good. Have traveled in England and Europe a lot over the years and this is one of the best hotels we have stayed in."
March 2017,One of my top 5 London Hotels,"We stayed at the Hari for one night while enjoying a weekend in London to shop and eat.  We booked a King deluxe room based on the reasonable price in comparison to other 5 star hotels we stay at. Also the excellent location for shopping at Harrods, Kings Road and Harvey Nichols.   We arrived and were greeted with an exceptionally warm welcome and instantly hit it off with Nicole.  She was the perfect balance of warmth, friendliness, fun and professional. We chatted about our plans for the weekend amount other things.  Later that evening we had a knock at the door and received a tray with items crafted out of chocolate that related to our earlier chats with Nicole, it was such a surprise and so touching, thoughtful and personal to us, unlike general box of truffles etc.  We were‚Ä¶"
March 2017,Pleasantly surprised!,"The Hari is a very cozy hotel in Chesham place, and it was the first time we chose it, because we like the area and we thought it was also value for money. We were more than happy with our stay! The staff was polite and accommodating, the room very pleasant, the breakfast delicious! We will definitely go back, we highly recommend it!"
April 2017,"Excellent hotel with nice rooms, great location and fantastic staff",I traveled with my 12 year old son. We both felt so welcome and the staff helped us with our questions and requests. Their care and service put a silver lining on our stay.  I highly recommend a stay at The Hari!
April 2017,"Beautiful, 5 Star stay, central location","The Hari is nothing short of 5 star, from the moment you arrive and greeted by the doormen, check in, and the rooms, everything was beyond expectations! These days it is hard to come by, this is why I stay at boutique hotels. We stayed here twice during our visit to London, both times for 5 nights, at the start and the end of our trip. Once on the 5th floor, then on the 8th. Both rooms fantastic, views on the 8th floor provided view of the London Eye and skyline.   Room: We upgraded to a Twin Premium room, fantastic size room with 2 extra large single beds, couch in window, mini bar, TV etc... with great size bathroom. The use of space was very welcoming, lots of mirrors as well. The room was lovely, fresh, clean, lots of light, large windows and wooden floors. Bed was very‚Ä¶"
April 2017,"Elegant, Cozy and Friendly","Love this hotel! Centrally located, wonderful, smart, interesting and interested staff, cozy room and super fast and kind room service (Thank you, Sabrine, you are the best! Promote her, guys!) plus great food in the restaurant, awesome concierge. I come to London lots, this is my second time at The Hari and I will be back next year. Thanks for a great trip, everyone!"
April 2017,Italian luxury in London,I cannot recommend The Hari London enough. From the complimentary glass of wine when I arrived to the room upgrade when I told them I was a sleep deprived Mama in search of respite and the general friendliness and warmth expressed by every single member of staff I came into contact with. The oxtail ravioli at the Hotel's Il Pampero restaurant were beautiful and the vege full English breakfast was fantastically filling. Bathtub is definitely big enough for two..my little legs couldn't reach the end so I was mostly trying not to drown üòÅ But the marble luxury of the bathroom and Noble Isle products more than made the effort to stay afloat worthwhile!  Room was very clean and comfortable too. Free WiFi did disconnect quite a few times but was generally good.  Guest Relations‚Ä¶
April 2017,Excellence,"Have stayed at many wonderful hotels around the world, The Mercer in NYC, The Mandarin Oriental in London, Aman resorts etc, and this one is exceptional. Not just the hotel and its facilities, great rooms, excellent hotel restaurant and bar - but especially the staff. Every day of my 10 day stay staff were very kind and very cheery to deal with, and terrifically attentive."
March 2017,"Great hotel, friendly staff","Enjoyed our stay at the Hari. The staff were exceptionally good, couldn't do enough for you and made the stay feel personal. Great location, comfortable rooms. The only negative is that bar menu is expensive even for London prices. "
March 2017,my new favorite hotel in London,"a really great place to stay in one of Londons best areas and also more tranquil than being in the West End of London. Close to  Londons best shops, including Harrods and a wonderful selection of  restaurants to choose from or be advised by the very knowledgeable hotel staff."
March 2017,Exceptional,"I dont usually write reviews but i felt compelled to in this case, I treated my parents to a anniversary weekend and i booked the Hari based on the many positive reviews i had read. The whole experience and attention to detail and service is indeed exceptional, i have been lucky to stay in many 5* hotels but in the UK, the Hari surpasses them all, the informality combined with first class service from every member of staff is a credit to the hotel and reflects in the investment in the people who work there and nurtures a very relaxed, enjoyable experience for the residents. We were checked in by Renata, who symbolises the attention to detail and makes it all look effortless, she is engaging and friendly, once she discovered it was my parents birthday/anniversary weekend, she‚Ä¶"
April 2017,Back at my london home,Great to be back at The Hari such a great spot for shopping in Knightsbridge... the Italian recently opened in The Hair is a must! Not forgetting to start the day with the breakfast spoilt for choice on the English or vegetarian option both üëå
March 2017,Mr,"Would recommend. Fantastic food, and great decor. Staff very attentive. High quality feel.  Breakfast and restaurant 10/10.  Room (for the price) 8/10 Staff 10/10 Hotel quality and feel 10/10 Location 9/10 Value 9/10 ................"
March 2017,Positive vibes and great atmosphere ,"Ok, this place is absolutely beautiful and great place to hang out with friends, the terrace is amazing, you can smoke upstairs in the terrace. It has good coffee and a cozy place, it is a place to visit if you are in London. Best time to go around 8PM."
February 2017,Great bar,"Amazing hotel, great terrace, great bar! Andre provides amazing service & knowledge. Very inspiring :)  Was contacting bar for arranging great lounge table for evening & Andre managed amazing space & service for us Great experience :)"
February 2017,CANT WAIT TO STAY AGAIN!,This hotel made our trip to London even more amazing!  It was my birthday weekend and they were incredibly accommodating. The staff was incredible.  The hotel was beautiful and the location is perfect.  Everything about this hotel was wonderful.  Looking forward to coming back!
February 2017,Excellent birthday,"Recently visited with my fianc√©e, we travelled to Birmingham and London to see the cities as part of my birthday celebrations. Absolutely excellent, on check in the staff were quick, friendly, provided us with a large supply of information and the room wasn't too far from the main lobby. Good supply of shower gels and toiletries in the room, along with tea's and coffees also. Staff had no trouble bringing fresh milk to the room as UHT isn't my thing!! We went out for dinner both nights of our stay as we dined in the hotel in Birmingham and wanted something a little different however menu looked like there was a very large selection however potentially a little pricey? Maybe just as it is London? Couldn't fault cleanliness of the room or hotel in general and overall was a lovely‚Ä¶"
February 2017,Great Experience,"Loved staying at the hotel. You couldn't find a more friendly and responsive staff, be it the front desk, in-room dining or housekeeping. Top of the line people. The suite was quite spacious by London standards and had all the amenities. The hotel is at a great location too!"
February 2017,Best hotel experience I've had in London in 15 years (from a frequent London visitor),"I travel to London for business nearly monthly.  I have slept in hundreds of tiny, Victorian-portioned rooms with receptionists that won't let you check in early even if the hotel is half-empty, starving for breakfast because nothing on the menu aligns with my various food allergies.  Needless to say, the Hari has changed my entire outlook on traveling to London.  The Hari benefits from the most customer-service friendly, well-trained hospitality team of professionals I've ever encountered in London.  Upon check-in, they took great delight in showing me every feature of the room including the zippy, complimentary smart phones. Then they sent up tea to calm me after my long flight.  They even left me a bottle of wine and personal notes to check in on my stay. No detail is too‚Ä¶"
February 2017,Brilliant ,"We spent one night in the Hari. The service was great, all of the staff were friendly and attentive. We had the continental buffet breakfast which was lovely, there was a very wide range of food. The rooms were beautiful, well furnished and the facilities were great. "
February 2017,I. Mazhar ,"Our stay at The Hari made our trip to London more enjoyable. The staff are warm, welcoming and smiling every time you walk into the lobby. The room service is excellent. Cleanliness is outstanding. It will be my preferred hotel in London. "
February 2017,Sublime stylish and on trend ,The young and good looking staff have perfected the balance of being engaging but not being in your space. The foyer/ bar is relaxing but can be busy in the evenings. The rooms are stylish but small for price. Very conveyfor Knightsbridge and Sloane street. Restaurant is excellent Italian and good service. 
January 2017,A fantastic stay in Belgravia,"We enjoyed a lovely weekend of business and pleasure in Belgravia at The Hari. The location is beautiful, the property is stylish, the staff is charming and attentive and the accommodations are welcoming, luxurious and clean."
February 2017,Outstanding ,"I stayed at The Hari for 1 night and the service I received there was absolutely outstanding, from the delightful welcome from all the front office team to the amazing lunch in there In house restaurant Il Pampero,to turn down service from housekeeping in the evening. I would 100% recommend this hotel to all my friends and family as I couldn't of felt more special during my stay. Thanks for an Amazing stay, I will be back for sure!   See you soon.  Aimee McCheyne "
January 2017,Impeccable! One of the best hotel in London,"We stayed for 8 nights. The hotel has a modern, artistic decor and is extremely updated and clean. Excellent location in the Belgravia district of London. The best part of this hotel is the outstanding staff. They were all very service oriented, welcoming, supportive and generally nice and friendly. Harrods and high-end shops are just a few blocks away. I'm not a smoker, but my spouse is. The hotel has a trendy outdoor terrace bar for smokers. It's located just outside of the main cocktail lounge. The terrace has smoke vents, heat and a retractable glass ceiling and a nice variety of cigars. The il Pampero restaurant located just off the lobby was very good as was room service. There are many other dining options, within walking distance."
February 2017,gem of a hotel in London,"highly recommended hotel in London excellent location clean rooms super food attentive staff great buzz in the hotel Top notch Hotel  cant fault anything  at this hotel nice size, not too many rooms either"
August 2016,A nice stay,"Conveniently located in a quiet neighborhood but only a short walk from central London, The Hari is a good choice for a short trip. The atmosphere of the hotel is nice, with some beautiful decoration details. The rooms are clean and beautiful, although a bit tight. Front desk staff is very helpful and friendly.  The service at the restaurant could use a little help, though, as they served us only half of our breakfast order (had to remind them about the rest, which came very late after we had already finished everything else). "
February 2017,Perfect Week end!,We had an excellent trip at the Hari 's Hotel. The room is very beautiful The service and the Location are perfect  We strongly recommend this hotel to everyone !!  The week end was perfect. I hope coming back quickly
February 2017,ExcellentHotel,Excellent location convenient for dining and shopping. Great rooms with excellent decorating. Exceptional hospitality and service during our stay really making us feel warmth and like home. Looking forward coming back for another stay!
February 2017,Thank you!,"I came to The Hari with my daughter and stayed there for 3 nights. The location is great, only 10 minutes from Knightsbridge and 20 minutes walk from Central London! The hotel doesn't have a lot of rooms which is perfect as the atmosphere is cosy and friendly. The continental breakfast offers a nice choice of pastries! I would really like to thank the Front Office Team for their flexibility and more specifically, Alex for the amazing welcome! Will definitely recommend and will come back! "
January 2017,Perfect!!,"location, room, service, etc. everything was perfect. great. I think I can't forget this hotel forever. I strongly recommend this hotel to everyone! How can I tell you more about this hotel! Please go there and experience yourself!"
February 2017,A wonderful stay,I enjoyed my stay at your hotel and will recommedn all my friends to book your hotel when they visit London. You made my stay memorable. Everything from staff to rooms to service was extremely wonderful.  Thanks! :) 
February 2017,the little hotel that could,"The Hari  hotel is in one of the nicest areas of London. The hotel staff and service is excellent and they give  this 4 star hotel a 5 star feel. The rooms are modern and well appointed, but are on the small side. What the hotel lacks in room size and charm, they more then make up for  with their   fantastic staff and the little extras that they offer. I look forward to my next stay at The Hari."
November 2016,Cool Central London Hotel,"I've stayed at The Hari a couple of times recently and have been very impressed by the staff and hotel. The rooms are well appointed with good size seating areas, a decent TV and fantastic bathroom, both times with a great shower.  The location is ideal, close to Victoria and Knightsbridge tubes stations, about 10 minutes from each.  The staff were very professional, but friendly at the same time, it's a nice touch that they accompany you to your room after check in.  Overall a great place to stay and I'll definitely be staying again."
January 2017,Super friendly staff,My son and I spent 3 nights in the Hari and were welcomed in a pleasant way and very personal. Staff gave us good suggestions where to go and were to eat. The second day we returned to the hotel the end of the day and found nice pastry in the room modeled after the tower ( the Shard) we visited that day. Especially thanks to Anita and Alin our stay was very memorable.
December 2016,Above expectation,"Our stay was above expectation, well located, two good metro options, super attentive staff, suprise at Valentin's Day with our room decorated with rose petals, we would definitely return to The Hari."
December 2016,"Comfortable, beautiful and friendly","I have been to this hotel a few times and find it to be a home away from home. It is relaxed and has a beautiful interior.  The staff are so friendly, welcoming and accommodating it is a joy to visit. I love that we were given small bottles of water on arrival and every time we left the hotel.  The restaurant is also very nice and relaxed and you do not feel like you are eating in a hotel.  Looking forward to a return visit!"
December 2016,Exceptionally Amazing staff,"Perfect location, the most amazing staff always making you feel welcomed. Friendly atmosphere, making sure they assist you with anything possible. Rooms are nice, overall perfect place to stay business or pleasure trip. Bar/ terrace is located on 1st floor a place to unwind the day or evenings."
December 2016,"Excellent, comfortable stay","As soon as we walked into the Hari we felt welcome and comfortable. We were greeted by friendly staff who were helpful and smiling. After eating a delightful sweet from the front desk, we were guided to our room and left to relax in contentment and modest luxury. A great night sleep and superb service from the Hari staff through until we left. "
December 2016,Lovely hotel but bar is smoke ridden,A great experience overall. Friendly staff. Beautifully decorated. 5* experience. But the lobby and bar area just reeks of cigar smoke. There is a smoking terrace above the bar but on a Saturday night - the smoke and smell is just overwhelming if you're a non-smoker. 
December 2016,"Great value, extremely friendly & clean rooms","One of my best hotel experiences in my life and I have traveled a lot.. I don't think you will ever come by a friendlier and more genuine set of staff. Great team! We got upgraded to a bigger room on arrival, the design was great, rooms were clean and the location was perfect either as a newcomer to London or a more experienced visitor!"
December 2016,Unbelievable in every way! ,"From the moment we arrived, the Hari provided first class service. Friendly helpful staff and luxurious amenities in a great location really can't be beat! The Handy phone in our room was a great touch, it provided free internet service and local calling and was indispensable while touring London. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and the rain shower was unreal! We only wish we stayed at the Hari longer.    "
December 2016,The best 5 star hotel in london,"We booked the Hari as it looked much more up top date than the fussy traditional blue curtains and gold tie backs of the historic hotels.  It's didn't disappoint, but despite being incredibly fabulously interior wise, the service surpassed all expectations. Have stayed in many hotels and the service here is the best i have experienced. Notably we were offered a choice of rooms and where possible a complimentary upgrade. Equally we experienced complimentary drinks and extremely friendly good service.  Notably the concierge was able to arrange 2 or 3 of the top london restaraunts for us. One of the was Dinner by Heston and i meet people regularly who have been struggling to get a table.  Value wise- it was min better value than the historic or big names - this helped towards‚Ä¶"
January 2017,Fabulous service & great location &beautiful property,"The hotel is located in the heart of Belgravia, a quiet, filled with embassies area and it is a gem of a property, fully refurbished , with great design accents  and beautifully appointed rooms , decorated in calming colors, and flaunting superb materials. The rooms are on the small side, but it's understandable considering the type of building that hosts this hotel, and that minus is compensated by great amenities and an amazing location. Yet, the uniqueness of this property is given by its staff and service: welcoming, friendly, warm, professional, always with a smile and ready to offer their help, or a good advice. Our stay was one of our best hotel experiences , and we can't wait to go back. The bellman staff - ( Matias and Florin especially) - are the accolades that embrace‚Ä¶"
January 2017,Wonderful stay,"We had a lovely 1 night stay. The staff from the moment we walked in to the moment we left were wonderful. Room service breakfast was good, the bar on the first floor relaxing and the hotel is in a fantastic location. I would recommend this hotel and will stay again in the future"
January 2017,Superb!!! ,"Our staying in The Hari, was an excellent choice for our short vacation in London. Sloane Square metro station was a 10min walk and from there you could go everywhere in London. Belgravia is one of the nicest places in London, friendly, very quiet and we enjoyed walking through it. Outside the hotel there was always a cab, for those who didn't want to walk to the metro station. The room was spacious and modern decorated. The bed was so comfortable, that you didn't want to get out of it.  They provided us with a mobile phone,  where the city map was loaded and various tourist friendly applications. You could also use it for calling,  but unfortunately Greek numbers were not included. The staff was great,  very polite and kind.  Continental breakfast was included,  which was very‚Ä¶"
January 2017,Christmas Holiday," SUFFERING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A GOOD HOTEL AND AN EXCLUSIVE HOTEL As the end point of our Christmas holiday was one of the London airport, we decided to spend our last night at THE HAR√çA-London Belgravia Hotel. Again, great decision. As an architect with many years of hotel construction experience, I never had the opportunity to take on the responsibility of building a Boutique Hotel. THE HARI is a great example to analyze and enjoy the difference between a good hotel and an exclusive hotel. I recommend those interested in sharing this concept to tray it. We coincidentally coincided at the time of check-in with the prestigious Spanish journalist ""Mr. I√±aki Gabilondo"" and it was a pleasure and a pride, to see the education, kindness and effectiveness with which was treated for‚Ä¶"
January 2017,Best experience amazing staff,"We arrived exactly at noon with our room waiting for us . Started organizing to leave to tour the city when we discovered an undetectable (by any standard) problem in the room (left under the bed by the previous tenants). The hotel staff was so friendly and apologetic, we where shortly upgraded to a junior suite until the end of our stay 5 days later. I would like to thank Anita and all staff members for an amazing stay, starting from the comfortable bed clean room great breakfast and amazingly over the top courtesy and willingness to help by everyone at the hotel.  Thank you for making this a memorable experience."
January 2017,Great Experience,"Although I have been a regular at this hotel over time, this is the first time I stayed when under owner-management. I am pleased to say that standards are as high as ever. Great location, great rooms & good food/drinks options. The stand-out though is the staff. A number of familiar faces. Always pleasant, always helpful. Expensive, but good things don't come cheap. Highly recommended."
January 2017,Stunning hotel with exemplary service,"We enjoyed a superb stay at the Hari.  The attention to detail and exemplary service standards were beautifully bundled up in a classy, modern and chic environment.  We particularly enjoyed sipping some amazing cocktails in the relaxed yet classy bar area.  The room offered a nice aspect and was meticulously clean.  All in all, a great hotel tucked away in a fantastic part of the City.  Thank you, see you soon."
January 2017,Service with smile - The Hari Hotel ,"Back in England after more than 10 years... I picked the hotel based on the reviews. We arrived early at 10.30am on the 23 Dec 2016. Dead tired after 18 hours flight. The weather was cold and by the time we reached the hotel we are just exhausted.   The girl at the reception was really cheerful and welcoming, I wished I remembered her name, all I remembered she planned to visit Asia in Jan 2017. She was helpful and tried to arrange for early checked in. She even offered us coffee tea while waiting for the room. Jack the concierge ever ready to serve us with the luggage, and within 10 mins we got our room. It was really a good start...  The place is cosy and artful. I bet every little things placed were done carefully. The room is not that big but it was cozy enough for us. All I‚Ä¶"
January 2017,Another great stay!,"The Hari is a fantastic place to stay. Great location (my fav in London, quiet, leafy and near Knightsbridge) with beautiful rooms. Stayed in both a suite and a deluxe room over the course of a couple of weeks in Dec, and have to recommend the suite. Impeccably furnished and surprisingly spacious for a hotel in London.   Have stayed here previously a couple of times, and every trip has been consistently great. Friendly, warm staff all made me and my sisters feel comfortable and welcome throughout the stay. Will definitely be back!! :)"
January 2017,Best Birthday!!!,I have staied in this beautifull hotel in order to celebrate my 30s Birthday. As soon as you enter the main Door you feel welcome as you would enter into  your House. Staff very attentive and a special thanks to  Ricardo and Daniel for taking care of my luggage and the guys at the restautant for attending me during my dinner.  Good size room facing the front with outstanding View. I will be back for my 31. 
December 2016,Perfect London pit stop!,"I wanted to try out the Hari because of its' excellent location and good-looking rooms. Wasn't disappointed, the staff were very friendly and welcoming and as my room wasn't ready yet when I arrived, I got upgraded to a King suite. Nice room layout, very well equipped and clean. I then received a bottle of Veuve Cliquot to make up for the very short wait. The staff at this hotel is what made the difference for me...everyone I interacted with was warm, friendly and anticipated my every need. I will definitely go back."
November 2016,An oasis of sophisticated calm in London,Beautiful sophisticated 70s decor with impeccable service.  The staff are attentive without being overbearing.  The rooms offer a cosy calm against the bustle of London.  Ask for a room facing the square.
December 2016,Best hotel I've stayed at in a very long time,"I stay in a lot of hotels around the world, and The Hari is my new favourite.  The decor is stylish, the location convenient and charming, but what sets this hotel apart is by far and away the quality of its service team.  Without exception, every interaction with the team was friendly, felt genuine and full of enthusiasm and energy.  The service was attentive without being sycophantic which is so much more pleasant.  It felt more like staying with rich friends who have a more stylish home than you, and who are just the most charming hosts that make you never want to leave.  Forget large anonymous chain hotels, stay at the Hari and relax."
November 2016,Perfect,"I visit London frequently, I would say The Hari is the most value for money that I ever booked. The location is just excelent 4 min from Bus Station & 9 Min from underground plus all you need is with a walking distance. The Staff are very friendly and would offer their help for anything you need. The Room is Clean l, specious and luxury."
November 2016,"Great service, great location","I stayed in this hotel right in the heart of Belgavia.  It is small and very luxurious.  The room was inventively planned and very comfortable indeed.  The staff, from the doorman, to reception, to the waiters all made you feel like they really cared.  It is in easy reach of Knightbridge and Sloane Square and a great spot for a shopping expedition but is still within easy reach of the West End."
November 2016,Amazing Hotel,I stayed at The Hari Hotel for my birthday and it was perfect from start to finish it was superb. The service we received from all staff was impeccable and we could not have asked for more.  The bar area is beautifully decorated and was a great place to enjoy pre and after dinner drinks. Our room was spacious and very tastefully designed with great views.  It is also in a great location with only a short walk to Harrods and a easy tube ride to Oxford Street/Regent Street Shops.  We cannot wait to return to The Hari hotel very soon and highly recommend it.
November 2016,Superb hotel!,"Our experience at The Hari was absolutely amazing from start to finish. It was my partners birthday and I surprised him with a weekend away to London. Prior to booking I got in touch with Alex to arrange some extras for the room and his willingness to help and make this occasion special was really something else. We had complimentary champagne, balloons and cake in the room which my partner loved and The Hari even upgraded our room to a suite which was incredible. Bath with views overlooking the park, comfortable bed, gorgeous amenities. The Hari simply have everything you could possibly need for a 5* stay.  If you're considering staying at The Hari, do not even hesitate. It's an amazing hotel with detail to everything imaginable. Expect a warm personable greeting on arrival and‚Ä¶"
November 2016,ALWAYS AN AMAZING STAY,"amazing hotel, at the best location.  great staff  ROOM ARE SPACIOUS, CHIC... MARBLE, GREAT DECO AND designed deco pi√®ces  the entrance of the hotel is so confortable, and welcoming  breakfast always a best"
November 2016,The jewel of london hotels,The hotel is small and rooms aren't the biggest but the hotel staff are excellent extremely helpful and constantly went over and beyond at this stay. The rooms have a superb finish and the in room dining is second to none. We can't wait to come and stay again - Alex the manager is an absolute delight he made our stay unforgettable - thank you 
November 2016,Wonderful Hotel!!,"Delightful boutique hotel, with the most attentive / friendly staff. Great location as its in walking distance of the Natural History Museum and Harrods. Excellent facilities, this is easily one the best hotels I have stayed in for some time !"
November 2016,Too short a stay,"Had only one night here but felt great from moment large door swung open to reveal genuine welcome, uncliched style and cocoon like atmosphere. It's bang in the centre of centres - Harrods is a few streets over, plenty of life nearby but this is lovely quietl area so good nights sleep in spacious room with decent bed and heavenly sheets. All the details like ironing boards and handy sockets there. Tasty breakfast with a bit of imagination and great coffees. And the staff? Nothing short of brilliant. Only complaint - lighting slightly too low so couldn't find things in suitcase, so really not a complaint. Go have fun and stay longer than we did. "
November 2016,My last visit to London ,"It was the first time for me in the Hari hotel as every time I go to London I book in the JW , I will never forget this trip!! It's amazing, the location of the hotel is perfect and the price for 2 weeks is good, the staff is very friendly and helpful the room serves is wander full and fast, I try the food as well and it's delicious! Simply this is the warmest trip ever . If you looking for luxury & cozy place just choose that one."
November 2016,Nice hotel but far from city center with children,"The room is very nice, modern and so quiet. The hotel offers a handyphone for net, maps and international calls for free for some countries. Unfortunately, Portugal isn't included but it was very helpful for itineraries in the city, internet, etc I have been in London with my daughters ( 8 and 11years old) and I think the hotel could be more close to the city center . The distance between the hotel and the nearest tube station is about 15 min walking . For me it was easy but for the girls, in the end of the long day , it was very hard. The hotel is in residential zone, therefore, there aren't a lot of restaurants, supermarkets, coffee shops,"
November 2016,Great hotel in the middle of beautiful Belgravia area,"First visit to the Hari in the middle of beautiful Belgravia was a nice experience - great hotel, nice & clean rooms as well as bathrooms, friendly service was a very positive surprise as I had not heard of the hotel before. The Hari is also within 5-10 minutes walking distance from both Knightsbridge and Sloane Squae, so good shopping areas and  tube stations nearby"
November 2016,Beyond amazing‚Äì6 star hotel! Staying here was incredible.,"This is the kind of hotel you want to keep an absolute secret because it's so wonderful.  We have stayed at some of the nicest hotels around the world and never before had an experience like we did at The Hari. At every step, it was above and beyond.  We're really picky when we stay at hotels (about hygiene, decor, and quiet.) The Hari beyond exceeded our expectations and hopes.   Their rooms are STUNNING with impeccable views, they give you a complimentary smart phone during your stay for traveling around the city, their breakfast and restaurant is divine‚ÄìI could go on and on. Clean, beautiful, chic, tasteful, quiet, perfect location. What more could you ask for?  The staff was so lovely, we were literally sad to say goodbye to them. They were the most responsive, warm, and‚Ä¶"
November 2016,Lovely Hotel for Events,"We held a private event here on the terrace, followed by dinner in the private dining room and drinks in the snug. Perfect for small events of 10-20 people. Great location and decor. This would also be a lovely hotel for anyone wanting to stay in London for the weekend."
November 2016,"Fine hotel, very good location","I travel very often to London and I always choose to stay at ""The Hari"", because of the very good location, the fine atmosphere, the artistic design and decoration, the impeccable cleanliness, the courtesy,  willingness and flexibility of the highly trained staff (to mention especially Anita and Alex - Deputy managers, Nabil - Bar Manager, Sammy - Bar tender, the doormen, all are fantastic!). I highly recommend ""The Hari"" to everyone who would like a stylish and comfortable stay in London."
November 2016,"A well located hotel , almost near everything",excellent hotel . must visit. extremely welcoming and the heated outside garden /bar is wonderful . i suggest it is a must visit hotel. it is near the shopping boutiques and the famous Harold. walk away from Sloane street and kings road  
November 2016,Amazing stay at the Hari !,"The hotel was so central and great for a nignt stay with the children and our stop at winter wonderland, the staff were friendly and helpful and we felt immediately relaxed that it was family friendly. The room was spacious and clean and they went to the effort of bringing treats for the children which they loved . Would definitely recommend the Hari for a great stay in central London!  Thank you we felt very looked after and had a great time!"
November 2016,Loved this place,The concierge service at the Hari went above and beyond-from helping out with lost packages to loaning their personal Oyster card.  The chocolates and bottle of wine in the room didn't hurt either! Don't miss their cocktail lounge upstairs-uber chic!
October 2016,Serendipity at The Hari,"Every once in a long while an unpleasant experience turns into a fantastic one. So was my experience at The Hari, a fine luxury establishment in terms of rooms, food and location. It's the staff, however, that makes the difference between a good stay and a great one. In this regard, the staff at The Hari is exceptional and in my case they managed to change my opinion from utter disappointment (due to what is probably a rare mishap) to complete satisfaction. Special thanks to Ms. Chettiar for going beyond the call of duty to ensure a very pleasant stay at the hotel; her emotional intelligence score is off the charts! Thank you to The Hari London team. I already look forward to my next visit."
September 2016,Super place to stay in London!,"The Hari is a really nice hotel in the heart of London. Location is perfect to visit the inner city. The service is of high quality, the employees are full of attentions to make you have a great experience. I would definitely come back :)"
October 2016,Full marks to a wonderful staff,Hotel is very central and suited our needs.  The staff were extremely friendly and no request  seemed to be a burden. I felt there was team effort in the hotel and all pulled together to make our experience a most enjoyable one.
September 2016,Our trip to london,Nice hotel nice room employees very kind  good location in one of the best  place of London I recommend  this hotel to everybody the breakfast was so accurate with a large choice of  sweets when l come to London  in the next future I retur to your hotel  kind regards Marinella Mattia is very friendly person 
September 2016,Comment ,"Simply perfect in all aspects of service , wide and clean room, complete breakfast. Position very Convenient for the main attractions of the town . Staff cheerful and accurate. Special thanks to Mattia for his attention ."
September 2016,"Fantastic boutique-ish hotel, in a fantastic location","I took my wife and daughter here for a weekend pre-ceding my work in London and it was fantastic. the staff, food, rooms....all just really really good and to be honest: that's hard to find nowadays! The best thing was that we paid a very reasonable price for London hotels! I had the best birthday weekend and a great stay for work as well!"
September 2016,Another Return Joy,"This is our third visit in as many years and it never fails to amaze.  The front staff are so cheerful, helpful but more importantly remember you by name, which in these days of hustle and bustle is a true gem....especially Ricardo, thank you. Ben the head concierge was just a superstar, you know what you did for us, thank you very much it was a mark of a true professional. May we thank Angie and the reception team for organising the ""Lion King"" slate in our room made of a wonderful looking brownie with the Lion King logo on top, unfortunately unable to eat as I am diabetic and my husband doesn't do cake but it was truly appreciated. All the staff whether breakfast,  (which is fabulous and fresh), housekeeping or reception are very pleasant, always say hello and again you don't‚Ä¶"
September 2016,Beautiful Accommodations and Top Notch Customer service,"Recently went on a group trip to London with a few friends, had originally booked another hotel but switched over to the Hari and we are glad we did.  Location is walking distance from a lot of major attractions (Harrods, Buckingham Palace, etc) but in a great location to walk to cute shops and restaurants but not have to deal with the traffic that deals with the hustle and bustle of being on a main road.  Checked in and was given an upgraded room, that always sets a nice pace but all the staff went out of their way to make my stay comfortable.  Simo, was especially wonderful as he greeted me by name every time I came in the door and while I wait for my friends would offer us something to drink (a real nice touch).  Rooms in London tend to be smaller than the US but even at what‚Ä¶"
September 2016,Anniversary treat made extra special at The Hari,"Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Hari. It was our wedding anniversary and the hotel went to, what we thought, was great lengths to make our stay one to remember. Check in was perfect, room ready, Joanna knew it was our anniversary and offered us complementary drinks (very tasty margarita). The room was spotless, modern, everything we needed. 1st night we received champagne and choccies, delicious. The small gym looked very new and modern and you entered using your room key so early starts were not a problem. Room service was efficient and all food was great, usual hotel prices. The location of the Hotel was perfect for us, short walk to Sloane St, Buckingham Palace, Harrods!  All in all we had a great time, the Hari staff were all lovely, friendly and very helpful. We‚Ä¶"
September 2016,A stay at this gem of a hotel is a must,"My partner and I have just returned from the most wonderful stay at The Hari and what a treat it was. From start to finish the experience was superb. Incredibly attentive staff, stylish rooms and a luxurious bar. The balance is just right - discrete, stylish but not pretentious. Our room (on the 9th Floor) gave us the most spectacular views over London and with the sun setting we were able to see London like we never have before. All this without even having to leave the room! The location is superb and I love all the little extra special touches and attention to detail. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel, A class. "
October 2016,The Hari - Amazing stay,"I stayed here twice in the space of 10 days and the team, the service and the location have not let me down.  I wish I had longer time to spend in the hotel and enjoy all the amenities. The fact that hey give you a complimentary device for calls and data roaming whilst you are here is the icing on the cake From check in to getting a cab and organizing my schedule - the team at the Hari were helpful and on hand. You have to remember the name of the hotel f wha tit was before being called the Hari as some taxi drivers do not know it - but they always get you to Chesham Place and the restaurant is usefully called Pont Street - so you can always find it."
October 2016,Excellent Choice,"Outstanding location, quality hotel, and gracious accommodating service.  Would recommend without reservations.  Short walking distance to Buckingham Palace, historic sites, Harrods and shopping.  Restaurants in area excellent."
October 2016,Wow,"We stayed for our anniversary as part of a weekend of treats and were truly bowled over by the standard of service and friendliness of staff, a bottle of champagne on ice and other treats were placed in our room to help with the celebrations. Fantastic!"
October 2016,IMPROVING EXCELLENCE,"Last week, I returned to Hotel Belgrave Thompson after his name change as THE HARI. Upon entering the hotel, I saw the intention of the owners to enhance their facilities as ""Boutique Hotel"" and though apparently +/- as usual, improve excellence is a very complicated task because the hotel is great, its suitable to their level facilities and the relationship have good value. I want to tell you that, I see very favorably impressed by the performance of a Spanish receptionist, I think called Victor, solving a problem about customers of their nationality during the night shift. His education, patience and kindness show that the hotel management has been very careful in the selection of staff. In summary, great location between Knightsbridge-Sloane Square-Buckingham Palace, great‚Ä¶"
October 2016,Great weekend at the Hari,Hari is in the perfect spot for the high end shopping and dining of Knightsbridge and Chelsea..rooms are luxurious and very comfortable.  Staff very attentive and food was excellent! Definitely be back 
October 2016,Very good lunch,"Went in after being rained on so it was unplanned. Very slick cafe with a modern feel and good service. Sliders were really good, chips were someone of the best that I have had on London. The nutella filled donut balls were heavenly! Loved this place alot."
October 2016,overnight,"The Hotel has an excellent location, very close to Knightsbridge. easy access with public transportation and private vehicle. Continental breakfast is very complete and very friendly staff, rooms are cozy and very comfortable bed"
September 2016,Stay at The Hari,"Unpleaseant stay, during the stay ac was not wroking and the room was very hot during the night. requested the management to send someone to fix it, engineer was sent after the first request then no other actions where taken to resolve the issue. "
October 2016,Change of ownership = change in focus = missed details and lower satisfaction,"I enjoy the lhotel and the general location but the mechanical and housekeeping issues along with other minor changes like no water bottles in the gym, a much poorer selection of teas in the room with the kettle, lowered my satisfaction and impacted my ability to sleep during this trip. This issues this trip prompted me to begin negotiating a rate with the Soho hotel to offer alternative accommodation with similar amenities and location value. "
October 2016,Avoid at all cost,"Absolutely horrible avoid at all cost!! This just 2 weeks  ago use to be one of the Thomson hotels called Belgraves hotel, now it's called the Hari. I have been staying at this hotel for the last 4 years when it was under the Thomson group and it was actually great. I don't know what happened but now it's an absolute Joke!! They have a problem with house keeping the rooms are not as clean as they use to, It's been 5 days here we're the AC of the hotel don't work and at the same time it's been recorded the warmest 2 days in London!! The management is absolutely not capable of running this hotel they are not even apologizing to anyone here about this issue. I have been trying to speak to the hotel GM for the last 3 days but he has been avoiding every one. I didn't get a single‚Ä¶"
June 2016,Honeymooning in London,The staff was super friendly and helpful.  They made us feel like royalty. An amazing experience from start to finish.  We would highly recommend this hotel in the wealthy Belgravia section of London and would absolutely return in the future. 
July 2016,Amazing getaway,"We had an amazing time at the Hari Hotel. Localised in the center of London, next to Harrods, everything was ""√† port√©e de main"", realy easy . We had a special attention thanks to our couple of friend that we were joining for the Week end. Champagne et truffle chocolate. The room was decorated with taste, elegance , cotemporary design with nice piece of furniture, opening on a amazing view on The City. Extremelly well fitted with everything you will need during your stay. If you are travelling to London, you can Not pass without spending a night or even more at the Hari H√¥tel.  We only wish we can have stay longer."
June 2016,"Excellent, highly recommended","Nowadays it is far from normal to get the a good, professional service when purchasing good and services but I have to say 'The Hari' really delivered, they are professional and friendly, they went out of their was to make sure our stay was memorable.  Their attention to detail is second to none and I would recommend staying here over anywhere I have stayed in the UK.  The position of the hotel is set for all your shopping and evening entertainment needs.  Dave"
July 2016,Smart Hotel - Good location ,Stayed here after a recommendation from a friend. A nice boutique hotel just 5 minutes walk from Harrods. Staff are very helpful and the rooms are very nice. Paid around ¬£220 for the room (Saturday night) including breakfast on short notice which for me was good. Would definitely stay here again
July 2016,Love this hotel,"Fab hotel for shopping in Knightsbridge/West End, the service is excellent, the staff are the best, so accommodating. We were celebrating my daughter's birthday and they made it extra special. Very cool hotel and bar. "
July 2016,The best hotel in London!,The nicest guest experience we have ever had! We had the best welcome from the FOM Alex Cohen and the events manager Marie Froger who literallly spoiled us with a lovely room. Although it was more than enough they took the time to prepare a special amenity with a picture of my husband and I with some nice chocolate truffles and Champagne! The best part is that the picture was edible! Incredible! We never experienced such a special attention and had the best time in London with our friends. Our favorite part is that you can borrow the Handy phone from your room to carry a smartphone with you. Every single part of this hotel is amazing and we would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to have the best getaway in London!
July 2016,My new favourite place in London! ,"I was staying at the Hari hotel for 4 nights and it was just perfect! The location, the bar always busy, the smoking terrace with the nice lanterns and the green plants on the walls, the decoration of the hotel and the room is very cosy, it is 10/10! About the staff they were all very nice and helpfull, at the front desk, the waiters, the housekeeping ladies, the porters such as Simo who was really amazing! Speaking so many languages, always smiling and at your service to help anytime you need! I just felt like I was at home and I didn't even want to leave :) I highly recommand this place! "
July 2016,Great location,"We selected the Hari because of its location and since we were travelling with a toddler, a decent onsite restaurant and bar. We weren't disappointed at all.  The Hari is a healthy walk away from many key sightseeing spots but also extremely convenient for cabs / uber.  The restaurant was perfect for us with healthy options for kids and adults.  The bar was nice but priced for the neighbourhood!  Our room was comfortable, clean, quiet, modern and stylish with all necessary conveniences. Being central London, space was a little tight though.  Service was professional and the door staff were helpful and welcoming."
July 2016,Perfect stay ,"An excellent hotel. The staff could not do enough for us and were attentive and helpful. The continental breakfast was lovely, and everywhere spotless. It was my wife's birthday, and the staff picked up on this and left a cake, a card and a bottle of champagne in the room. Cocktails in the bar were great. It's only a short walk from two tube stations, and close to lots of London landmarks. Overall, a fantastic weekend. "
October 2015,Excellent service and stay!!,I love staying at the Hari Hotel when I come to London on business which is about 6-8 times a year. They have been so welcoming and friendly each time. The service is amazing. The rooms are modern and chic. Very comfortable. Gym on site for exercise. The restaurant downstairs is also excellent - I've had breakfast and dinner and always loved my meal. Staff is friendly and accommodating. Couldn't recommend it more! 
June 2016,Best Birthday Trip Ever!!,"What can I say more about my ""home away from home"" hotel?? for the 2nd time I got an upgrade and the room was amazing! I love how the staff welcome me with my name and always smiling and trying their best to make me happy!! Thats a real 5 star customer service! its a small luxurious boutique hotel with best staff who are always smiling and helping, clean neat rooms, amazing views, all room amenities are available, in room service is recommended, food is tasty, and in great location in the heart of Belgravia! Thank You for the amazing stay I had enjoy my birthday in London and will do it again Xx"
June 2016,My london residence,"A visit to London wouldn't be complete without staying at the belgraves, fab staff great location for the west end and the breakfast menu is a must to start the day! Calling in the terrace bar for that cocktail, after a full day on your feet ""......."
June 2016,"Amazing staff, great location. Nice atmosphere","I stayed here before and enjoyed it then too, it is a really nice hotel and I think it has got even better. Staff are so lovely.   Location is Superb for shopping (and we did a LOT of it). I took a lot of clothes and we bought most of Harvey Nicks/ Selfridges on top of that. I asked when booking, could we have a lot of extra hangers as we booked a room with 2 Queen beds for my mother and I and we would be shopping the sales. They actually put a separate clothes rail in with about 50 hangers! We were so happy and used it up! :)   I flew in from Singapore and had tons of meetings, inevitably on Day Two the batteries in my blood sugar monitor ran out, worst possible timing, and I had no time to get new ones.

June 2016,Outstanding,"Excellent central location, friendly and efficient service, stylish and comfortable bedrooms, sophisticated bar, scrumptious breakfast, good value for money - what more do you want in a London hotel?  I can't think of a single way in which our stay could have been improved - every single need was anticipated and met with the kind of efficiency one can only dream of.  My favourite London hotel by far."
May 2016,Absolutely amazing,Beautiful hotel and top notch service - we couldn't fault this hotel. Great location to explore London on foot and beautiful surroundings in Belgravia. The staff are on hand for any request and made our stay exceptional.
May 2016,Engagement I will never forget...first class!,"From the moment I arrived through to departure. My surprise engagement was made so special by the team at the Belgraves...I am forever thankful as is my Fianc√© for making his plans run smooth! The design and style of the hotel is beautiful with modern styled classic amenities. The doorman was  friendly and genuinely remembered us every time we walked through the entrance. Ben was beyond helpful! The food was amazing and the newly crafted mojitos were amazing! The whole experience was seamless, stylish, personable and spotlessly clean and tidy. Can't wait to come back again! Thank you to an amazing team who genuinely work as a team!"
May 2016,Great hotel.,"Attentative staff. Good door man, check in lady, concierge, waiters & waitresses. Good location in Sloan square/ Belgraves. Quiet. Safe neighborhood. 10 min from Sloan tube station. Seems new and renovated. "
May 2016,Best service /friendliest staff,"My all time favourite hotel in love London! The location is tremendous, views are gorgeous, the staff are beyond kind. The food and room service is impeccable and is deliciously fresh and creative ! Attention ton detail and beyond all, if you have dogs, this hotel is perfect !"
February 2016,Top Hotel,My family just returned from a trip to London with friends and finally got to stay at the HBelgraves. We had heard and read a lot about it and weren't disappointed. The service was immaculate. The rooms were very comfortable and tastefully decorated. The public areas were very impressive and set off by some amazing and sometimes quirky art work. Worth every penny we spent. We come back for sure.
July 2016,"Thank you, Belgraves.","Our three nights here, spanning the time of the Brexit vote, met our expectations, and allowed us to see history being made up close.  The room was modern, with tasteful design, and was exceptionally clean.  We could not find a single thing in the hotel that was shabby in any respect - the hotel is immaculately maintained.  We also enjoyed the art within the hotel, ranging from Miros to Damien Hirsts and the Rolling Stones exhibition at the nearby Saatchi was very entertaining, as was our ""open day"" at Imperial College.  Our only suggestion is that the breakfast grew tiring after the second day and could have been a bit more elaborate, compared with what we had at other hotels during the same trip, but, other meals at the Belgraves (a lunch and a late night snack) more than met‚Ä¶"
September 2015,Superb Hotel,"Hi I have stayed in many five star hotels in London. This was my first visit to Belgraves. Amazing stay in a superb hotel, everything about our stay could not be faulted. Great location easy walk to Harrods and tube. Room was stunning, really comfy bed. All the staff were very efficient and extremely friendly. Breakfast was really good, lovely restaurant. I will definitely be booking for my next visit to London, cant wait. Many thanks to all Kevin"
July 2016,Impressive attention to detail and care for guest's experience!,"Belgraves is a case study in how a hotel should be designed and managed and more hotels should take note. The team that manages this hotel must be travelers themselves because they have looked at it from the traveler's perspective throughout. Here are just a few noticeable elements: - Rooms look good, are pristine well designed and well layed out but this is the expectation. - Staff is superb with great attitude and an attentive problem solving stance, team is smart and makes it happen. - Electric plugs available next to the bed and desk plugs offer international options. - USB charger in alarm clock and extra chargers available in the minibar drawer. - MAJOR list of complimentary items available on request, I did not take advantage of most things except: 1- In the online‚Ä¶"
June 2016,Terrific location in great part of London,"Excellent hotel within easy walking distance of major sites and transit.  Room was really well appointed, quiet, and great service.  Let us check in early after coming in after a long flight which was greatly appreciated.  Great service."
September 2015,BED IS SOOO COMFORTABLE,"AMAZING stay in a lovely hotel, staff are very polite and caring! beautiful restaurant and bar area! in a great area of london- only 15 minute walk to hyde park! would highly recommend- and cant wait to stay again."
June 2016,Visit to London,"The only way to describe our experience at the Belgraves is outstanding in every aspect possible! Every staff member was exceptional! Our special thanks to Andrew, General Manager!! What a fabulous team you lead! We spent 10 days with you & our thanks to Ben & concierge staff, John & his food & beverage team! You made us feel so welcome & at home! We can't say enough & we will definitely be back!  Thank you!"
June 2016,Ahmed,"The staff were all kind and supportive.  Upon checking out, I forgot important things in the safe, the front desk in charge managed to contact me and deliver everything orderly.  She asked me if it was all in order."
July 2016,Expensive but good,"Great location for the Chelsea flower show, sloan square and the museums of South Kensington. The staff were excellent and always helpful. The room was very good and the service was faultless. Would come back."
June 2016,Boutique hotel in Belgravia,"Nice hotel with a classy decor, little but complete gym, a lounge with sofas and nice photobooks. The staff is very kind, professional and smart. The buffet breakfast is not huge in quantity but great bin quality, and you can have free hot dishes a la carte (and a good espresso). Out of the door you will be in the middle of the embassy area, sorrounded by beautiful mansions, best shops and 10 minutes walk from Harrods/V&A/Saatchi Gallery/Sloane square ...."
June 2016,Perfect Valentines day stay!,"I stayed here for a night away with my boyfriend, it was amazing! Room had lovely great size bed, walk in shower and over all I loved the style of the room and hotel itself. Based a walk away from harrods and knightsbridge station, only let down is that there was not any restaurants we found within walking distance. Overall fantastic area and will defiantly be coming back!"
November 2015,World class service,"I have just checked out of Belgraves and can not thank them enough for a perfect stay. The hotel I was due to stay in around the corner didn't have my reservation, so I booked into Belgraves last minute. On arriving at the hotel I encountered complete professionalism / world class hospitality and utter luxury... I cant thank them enough for looking after me last night. I will be booking into this hotel to experience all the luxuries for a proper trip very soon..."
November 2015,Love!,"I absolutely loved this boutique hotel.  It was located in the beautiful Belgravia section of London which we found during a tour was the ""rich"" area where all the Consulates are and very very old money resides.  It was quiet, streets were lined with gorgeous old perfectly maintained homes and disgustingly expensive sports cars parked on the streets like they were Fords.  I mean I've never seen so many Ferrari's, Lambos and other things.   The room was kind'of tight but had a seating area and a separate bedroom.  The bathroom was nice and modern and the hotel toiletries were nice and smelled wonderful.   It was loud when those sports cars tore off --- we could hear everything from the street below and I did have to sleep with ear plugs in.   Staff were very friendly and helpful‚Ä¶"
November 2015,chris from NY,"friendly, professional staff. Great location, quiet yet close to restaurants, shopping, action. Made a point of remembering my name and addressing me so. Comfortable, clean room, provided welcomed travel amenities such as int'l adaptors"
November 2015,Some of the best service I've ever encountered,"Everyone working at the hotel was genuinely friendly and helpful. Of course, the facilities and room were all excellent, but the great service and vibe of the hotel due to the staff is what really made the place."
November 2015,So friendly!,"A lovely, not to big hotel in London! Stayed here for my birthday and it was perfect. Staff were attentive and couldn't do enough for us.Would come back in a flash! Room was spotless, and quiet, we may have been lucky, but there was no sounds from neighbouring rooms early in the morning or late on at night, a win in my books!"
November 2015,Good small business hotel,"I use this hotel everytime I stay overnight in London and it is very convenient. Located a few blocks from Knightbridge, it is within a cosy neighborhood with some restaurant options. The rooms are ok for a London hotel and the staff is always very friendly. Choice depends really on where you have your meeting in London."
November 2015,The most friendliest hotel I've ever stayed in,"Great cocktails, great location too. I brought my husband here for his 50th, I could not fault anything about the hotel.  It made our stay even more special! Thanks to Ben, head concierge. If only customer care was like this, in all walks of life. Take note people."
October 2015,Outstanding Service and Pet Friendly,"We have just returned from this amazing hotel after a 2 night stay booked at the last minute due to our first night in an apartment from hell in Kensington. I didn't have much time to do any research on this hotel like I usually do as we were already in London and had to find alternative accommodation very quickly that would accept our dog. Belgraves was the second hotel that I contacted and I was relieved to discover they were pet friendly and what an excellent choice I made. The service at this hotel is OUTSTANDING from the minute you check in to the moment you leave, after being in our room for around 15 minutes we had a phone call asking if everything was ok, they later bought cookies and water and in the evening asked if we would like a turn down service. We requested a‚Ä¶"
November 2015,"Great location, great service, comfortable","We stayed in the Belgrave for a week while visiting Wimbledon. As it was part of a package, I don't have the direct expense of the hotel (but likely expensive).  It is in a great spot in London. Easy walking to restaurant, tube, shopping. The hotel itself has exceptional service. The rooms are average sized for London (meaning for some they might seem small) but plenty of space in my opinion. The beds are great - somewhat soft so good for side sleepers. Room was clean and quiet.   If there was one negative, their restaurant needs another coffee maker - it seemed to be their bottleneck for breakfast."
November 2015,Best Boutique Hotel in London!,Best Biutique Hotel for me in London. Location was prime and walking distance to all the stores on Sloan street. Stylish hotel. A little pricey for the small rooms but worth it. Definitely be back again
November 2015,"Great Location, amazing staff!","Great location, very comfortable bed, great breakfast, best front desk manager ever (apologies for not remembering the name but we checked in on 11/24/2015)! In London for business for a couple of days, upon check in we were immediately upgraded to a larger room which was, of course, much appreciated. Lovely view from the 8th floor, great dinner at Pont St. the in house restaurant (I had the lamb, delicious!) Overall very satisfying experience."
November 2015,Amazing hotel in Knightsbridge,"I stayed in the Belgrave last weekend with my husband, twin daughters and small dog.  The hotel is small enough to make every encounter with the exceptional staff personal.  The attention to detail is so thoughtful and considered.  Pont St the restaurant is just brilliant."
November 2015,"Great staff, location. Cool place.","Everything as great at this hotel. The concierge is very helpful and always ready to help with suggestions. Room service is excellent. Great location in Belgravia, close to Harrods. I like staying there every time I go to London."
October 2015,A shining example of quality,"My Mum and I visited London for a west end and tourist visit this weekend and I booked Belgraves with only the online knowledge from online.   When we arrived we was greeted by a helpful bell boy who immediately offered assistance with our luggage. We booked in and the staff on the desk were most polite friendly and helpful and explained what was available in the hotel for the stay.  We went to our room and was impressed with the room itself, it is a very modern lay out and the bathroom was beautiful. The beds were very comfortable and guests are truly not short of anything in their rooms. We requested complimentary hot drinks and kettle and the staff had them up with a selection of choices on the tray. Nice touches like the Molten Brown complimentary gifts is a nice idea also. ‚Ä¶"
November 2015,Beautiful hotel,"Great location , great views from room, furnishings and finish to room were perfection .  Hotel restaurant was lovely and waiting on staff were great .  Concierge was very friendly but reception staff could have been more friendly ."
November 2015,Afternoon Tea,"Indulged ourselves on the Marie Anotoinette Afternoon Tea. Excellent food & they were happy to keep refilling our tea pots, especialy good with all the cakes. V polite staff. Even a doggie bag to take home what we'd not managed to finish. Will def. recommend as a special treat üòä"
September 2015,Now it feels like home...a must visit!,Visited the hotel for 2 nights in November and another 2 nights in September. The hotel is a must stay even for business travellers. The moment you walk into the front door you can feel the vibe and the friendliness of the staff. I must admit am a fan of the high-floor rooms for their stunning views of London (tip: remember to take a photo at night!). The rooms are cosy with excellent beds and very stylish decoration (thank god no carpets on the floors!).  Once again the tip from my side is: visit the Terrace especially those of us who wish to enjoy a cigar!  Highly recommended  P.S. Dear Belgraves staff: you will see me again and again
October 2015,5 Stars!,My wife and I stayed at Belgraves last week. We loved every minute of it. We arrived by car and the Door staff swiftly greeted us and made us feel welcome. The car was valeted parked and we were introduced by name to the receptionist. The room was ready and the luggage came straight up. The room was modern and funky and very luxurious.  Ben the Concierge sorted out all our arrangements with ease and we were made to feel at home by all staff we encountered. The staff recognised us by name throughout our stay which makes a real difference! We will definitely return in the near future. Such a cool place.  
October 2015,Nice stay,"Stayed three nights at the Belgraves.  It was a very nice hotel, great staff, good food.  The place is very stylish, with wonderful design elements in the lobby, lounge and rooms.  Note that the desks in the rooms are small, compared to true business hotels.  The staff all called me by name and were very accommodating.  The location is excellent.  I had one problem -- the bed in my first night's room sagged considerably in the middle, which I didn't know until I awoke at 3 a.m. in discomfort.  I reported it the next morning and they moved me to a different room (they originally were going to upgrade me for my troubles, but that didn't pan out.)  The new room and bed were great.    I would stay at the Belgraves again."
October 2015,Great experiencie. Best hotel to stay in london,"I would like to really highlight the exquisite service by all the staff; from recpeption and concierge to the bell boys. Specially Simo, Simone and Mattia, who took very good care of me and my friends.  The rooms were really comfortable and well decorated. The breakfast was really enjoyable.  All in all, a great experience. I will definetly come back.   Soledad Suarez "
December 2015,Marvelous Stay,"What an incredible hotel.  The property itself was stunning and alive and the restaurant was spectacular.  This was only outdone by the warm, friendly informative and caring staff.  I was so impressed from the moment I stepped out of the car and was greeted by Isreal and Mattia (the bell men) they escorted me into the beautiful lobby where the front desk crew took it from there.  The other bell men Simo, Simone and Mike were also on it through out the stay.  Anita, Hayley and Celia as well as others were so caring and made me feel at home.  Violetta the concierge hooked us up every night for dinner and tickets to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which was so much better that either movie.  The whole crew including the restaurant staff and especially the bar upstairs were‚Ä¶"
December 2015,Exquisite stay at Belgraves,"I have travelled the world and this is one of the loveliest hotels I've ever stayed out. The staff were so attentive -from the bellman to the concierge. Everyone was so helpful and really seemed to be invested in ensuring an excellent stay for us. The front desk staff remembered us and were helpful every step of the way.  The hotel itself  is in a perfect location with some of the best restaurants and shopping that London has to offer within walking distance.   The hotel was classy and chic and simply breathtaking. The attention to detail every step of the way was the perfect balance between decadent and feeling at home. The bars were comfy and refined and the cigar bar was not to be missed.  If you have the chance, I wouldn't stay anywhere else but The Belgraves. Thank you!!!!"
December 2015,Great...,"Spent two night here and we enjoyed every bit. We were on the 9th floor with a balcony with direct views of St Pauls cathedral and London skyline - the bed is very cosy and comfortable and everything you needed in a room was there.  The location is great, everything we needed was within walking distance - which was great after finishing work and checking in.  Staff are attentive and courteous. Breakfast was DELISH!  They also do afternoon tea there which is great! Highly recommend!  "
October 2015,Great stay from start to finish - we will definitely stay again!,"From the moment we walked into the hotel we enjoyed every minute of our stay. The check in was efficient and friendly, the ladies were both helpful and a pleasure to speak with. We had been upgraded to a larger room which was an added bonus, we'd assumed this was because we were celebrating both our birthdays and wedding anniversary but our friends who also stayed had the same upgrade. The room was very nice with a decent view, great size and a very comfortable bed. We arrived back after a wonderful evening out to find a bottle of champagne and fruit bowl in our room, what a great touch! Check out wasn't until 12pm so we weren't rushing and then we were able to leave our luggage with concierge. We certainly felt our custom was appreciated and the hotel now has to be one of our‚Ä¶"
December 2015,Bravo!,"This is hotel is the definition of the boutique hotel. It has the proper size. Not to small so that its bar and its restaurant are alive and not big so as to have a standard impersonal service.  The staff of the hotel is excellent. From the doormen to the receptionists to the waiters. All young people, eager to help you and make your life easier.  The location of the hotel is top. Best shopping in London within walking distance. Knightsbridge tube 7 minutes away walking distance as well. Super safe to go around anytime of the day or night as all the embassies are located in the area.  Design of the hotel and the rooms simply amazing though this is something ambiguous as beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Room size are on the smallish side but this is something that you do‚Ä¶"
December 2015,"Location, great value and terrific service","I stay here at least twice a month and this hotel always delivers with great attention to detail and personal preferences, friendly and efficient service and an unbeatable location, close to all the restaurants, museums and shopping in Knighstbridge, Chelsea and Belgravia, and a short taxi ride or walk into the West End of London - and it has a gym, restaurant and terrace bar. It is a very short taxi ride from Victoria railway station for trains to Gatwick airport, and also offers quick access to Heathrow airport via the motorway."
December 2015,nice hotel,i have visited friends who stayed in the hotel. great little place.the outdoor coffee place is lovely. the rooms are modern and boutiquey.i have been trying to stay there but its hard to get a booking.tks 
December 2015,Luxury at affordable price - outstanding customer service!,"I picked the Belgraves due to its location and price point and after reading the other reviews decided to give it a try. I have stayed at the Lanesborough Hotel,which is nearby, but at more than double the price it wasn't in my budget this trip. I must say the attention to welcoming guests, making sure they are comfortable and their needs met was superb at the Belgraves! Upon check in they sent tea to my room (my friend had coffee as she requested) and were attentive to any of our needs. they serve complimentary cheese and wine every night for an hour in their lovely bar on the first floor. If i was waiting form friend someone would come to ask if I needed a drink while i was waiting. The rooms were extremely nice and my Jr. Suite had a little alcove with a couch to enjoy‚Ä¶"
December 2015,Amazing Afternoon Tea,"Fantastic afternoon tea at the Pont Street hotel. Every whim catered for. Great choice of teas. The service was amazing and the young waiter who served us was very friendly, nothing was too much trouble for him ... And he didn't laugh when we asked how to use the unusual tea strainer! If you want the best Afternoon Tea in London book here"
December 2015,Fantastic Hotel,"We have used this hotel for years, and since it has been re-furbished it is really special.  I cannot fault the Staff.  Beds are really comfortable and the rooms are a perfect size. Always a pleasure to stay at The Belgraves"
June 2015,Nice Hotel & Better Staff,"Good location, close to all that matters in Knightsbridge & Belgravia. A well put together product, still in good shape in the rooms. Excellent staff throughout the hotel. A pleasure to stay in; we'll be back."
June 2015,Luxury chic,"Awesome, cutting edge. Every detail is taken care of. The room, exquisitely decorated, and the bathroom were full of light. Flawless. I had a beautiful night sleep. Attentive staff, very NY style. Not to miss out."
May 2015,Great location and super staff modern hotel in Chelsea,"Corner of Pont and Chesham street is this small boutique modern hotel that we stayed in via FHR amex booking. Staff very friendly and accommodating, rooms are warm and cosy and bathroom and large shower modern and clean. We dined in the restaurant downstairs for breakfast and it was fast and very good. This is a great location of walking to all nearby areas including the Kings road/Slone Sq, Bromton Road, or Buckingham Palace and St James's area. Would stay again!"
June 2015,Great Hotel - Even Better Staff!,"What a great hotel.  Modern, comfortable lobby and rooms. Great location. Ridiculously helpful staff! Door men were friendly and on the spot, front desk was knowledgeable, and helpful, even the turn down maid was impressive.  I had a delicious breakfast in the ground floor restaurant where I found they were serving water in some glasses I have been looking for years, when I asked where they got them, the whole staff went above and beyond to not only source them, but find me a full set!  Katrina (?), the General Manager, the food and beverage manager, and breakfast host went out of their way to get these for me and I am so thankful.  When I first arrived, I thought my room was a bit small (I choose the smallest room), but it was so well laid out that I never felt cramped.  The‚Ä¶"
June 2015,Belgraves - what an excellent choice!,"We stayed at Belgraves on a Thursday and Friday night as was working in the SW1 area and had a function in Central London on the Friday.  I arrived separately to my partner, and found to my delight it was only a 10 minute walk from London Victoria train station.   The hotel is set around the lovely Belgravia streets, and embassy central making it a very pleasant area.  After checking in an dropping off my bags, I went to the 1st floor to use the fitness centre - I had the whole place to myself (as usual in smaller hotels!) and the gym was thoroughly kitted out - fresh towels, apples, water, top equipment, good stretch out space, a cable machine and free-weights. Totally spoiled for choice!  I was staying in a Deluxe king room, and it was very nicely made up - my sort of style -‚Ä¶"
June 2015,Stunning Hotel & Outstanding Customer Service,"I booked this hotel for our accommodation during our Company Christmas Party (10 rooms).  From the offset, I found the Sales Manager (Giuseppe) to be fantastic.  Nothing was too much trouble and he organised our stay to finite detail (even upgrading my MD and surprising him with a Birthday Cake, and taking good care of the Events Organiser :-)  It's the personal touches like these that make a stunning hotel an OUTSTANDING hotel!  The d√©cor is very chic and trendy... very 'cool Britannia'!   I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in the Knightsbridge area.  Thanks again to Giuseppe and the rest of the staff at the Belgraves."
May 2015,What a great find! ,We were searching for a boutique hotel for our wedding anniversary. This was perfect. Combination of feel of the place and the service. The staff were very welcoming and the room was excellent - even though we booked last minute deal. There was champagne in the room. Small things make a big difference. In our case we used valet parking and forgot about the time on Sunday. When we got back the doorman had picked up our car to avoid the extra half day charge. Really thoughtful service. Thank you for surprising us in a positive way. Used to different types of surprises in London hotels. 
May 2015,Great Hotel in the middle of London,"I just had the great opportunity to stay the first time at the Belgrave a Thompson Hotel and it was fantastic. Anita who checked me in and out was absolutely friendly and knew about my reason to stay at the hotel. Without asking she informed me about the location of the event I needed to attend in the city. Well done. The rooms are beautifully decorated and have the normal size for a London hotel. After all it is a boutique hotel that offeres great comfort. The location is great as well, within walking distance to Harrods and Buckingham Palace. I loved the breakfast setting and buffet and the friendliness of all staff members. Everybody greeted me whenever and wherever I met an employee.   Please ignore the comments from the previous review about small rooms and small lifts.‚Ä¶"
May 2015,"Tiny Rooms, Overpriced, Lobby Smells","Upon arriving at the Belgraves, a wall of dirty UK pub smell welcomes you.  After checking in, cram yourself into the two-person lift to get to your room.  Hopefully you, your suitcase, or your lift mate aren't overly large.  Discover that even the ""deluxe"" rooms are quite small.  Go to take a bath, and find there is no tub.  Explore various ways of opening a shower door that collides with the toilet when opening outward, or gets the hanging towels wet when opening inwards. Ponder the strange placement of small windows around the room.    Admire the relatively tasteful decor.  Enjoy the clean and comfortable bed, the free wifi and variety of TV stations.  Restaurant food was good, but service was terrible.  Apparently the bar and drinks are quite popular amongst locals.  In‚Ä¶"
May 2015,Amazing Stay - best in London so far,"Believe me when I tell you that this place is amazing. From the moment you walk it it's classy without being tacky, the staff is attentive and friendly without being over bearing and the room (and even hallways) are immaculate! Well done (and the a la carte breakfast is good too and so is the staff!)"
July 2015,Wonderful stay,"I stayed at belgraves for four days, the staff is lovely and helpful. The area is quiet and homy but still close to all the right places. Breakfast is very nice and fresh. You will not regret your stay!              "
July 2015,Hotel was awesome,This hotel was awesome and perfect for business travel.  The rooms where very clean and comfortable.  The hotel restaurant was also delicious!  I really enjoyed my stay and will book here again when I return to London for business.
July 2015,Great hotel in the heart of Belgravia,"All the staff was very helpful and polite, the room was impecable and well design. The location is great and convenient. The tube is only minutes walking and there are plenty of nice restaurants around it I will stay here again for sure!       "
July 2015,An amazing experince in London,For the past years Ive always stayed in the same hotel in London but this time I decided to make a change and take a friends advice to trying the belgraves hotel especially that it's in the area where u prefer to stay. I stated for one night only but I can say it was one of my best experiences the hotel staff was professional and friendly and the room was very clean with good furniture. I would definitely stay in the belgraves for my next visit
July 2015,Chic Hotel located in beautiful Belgravia,"We chose this hotel because we had a great experience staying at a Thompson Hotel in New York... The Belgraves by Thompson is a sexy and stylish hotel with some New York edginess. The staff were outstanding - very friendly and accommodating. The rooms were beautiful and well appointed. The bar on level 1 was a great spot to enjoy a drink and relax. The location was great - very close to Harrods, Harvey Nicks Knightsbridge and the tube stations. Belgravia is a very expensive part of London, every second car is a Ferrari or Bentley. There are some great restaurants and gastro pubs close by. We would fully recommend this hotel. "
July 2015,Worth a Visit,This is a boutique hotel and I stayed here overnight with my daughter and son in law as a birthday gift.  The staff on learning it was my birthday provided small cakes in my room to share.  The location is perfect for walking - within a ten minute walk of Hyde Park and less than half an hour to Oxford Street.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  The rooms were well appointed and had everything needed for a comfortable stay. Air condition worked perfectly and I had a great view over the city. Excellent full English breakfast with delicious coffee.
June 2015,Rate incl breakfast but ...,"Found a great last minute deal, which included breakfast. But no one explained that it only included continental breakfast, even though we chose cheaper items from the menu we were charged for them which I found really annoying. That is the reason I am not rating this Hotel excellent, everything was - great room, super staff.               "
July 2015,Loved it,Stayed with mum For Chelsea flower show and business trip. Perfect location walkable to everywhere in Chelsea and Knightsbridge. Lovely front desk service was checked into the room early. Neat sized room but perfectly designed to accommodate a velvet sofabed and kingsize bed with privacy for both of us. Ate out nearby but the breakfast service was so friendly and warm and the best coffee ever. They forgot to offer us champagne as part of our package but it was just an oversight. I'll be planning another stay here soon I hope
May 2015,Great location ,Staff in general are very helpful. The atmosphere is relaxed and we felt very comfortable. However the overall experience was spoilt by a few things.   There was a party on the terrace which our room overlooked which dictated when we went to bed due to the noise. We sought refuge in the bar which wasn't a bad thing. The barman was great and mixes great cocktails!   The hotel is very warm and in the night we felt stifled so had to put on the air con which was really loud and meant we couldn't sleep. We had to turn it off and resorted to opening the window but the blackout blind kept banging and again meant we couldn't sleep.   In the morning we ordered a couple of coffees but these took almost an hour to arrive. We had to call housekeeping for shower gel and shampoo as they‚Ä¶
June 2015,Drinks reception,Pleasantly greeted at the hotel by two very helpful doormen who guided me towards my friends in the mezzanine lounge!  Very attentive staff on hand with drinks and delicious canapes. The manager of the hotel gave us a guided tour of the hotel which was very impressive. A small intimate hotel in a great location of London.
August 2015,A wonderful experience,"We stayed here a week. The staff was very attentive and helpful. Great with directions and information. Room was lovely. Love the turndown service with bottled water and cookies. Had room service one evening, and the food was excellent. Would stay here again,"
February 2015,Great Boutique hotel in posh hood,"We had a great stay at the Belgraves and it felt very much like a Kimpton Hotel (before IHG takeover) in the USA which is a great compliment.  I would say it's one of the top properties we have visited in a European city.  Pros: - very friendly and helpful staff across door staff, front desk and housekeeping - views from 11 floor corner room were amazing and multiple windows revealed close to a 270 degree view including small walk out balcony - room was modern and clean with nice touches such luxury bath products, slippers, and evening treats in turndown service  - location is convenient to underground and major sites - neighborhood is very peaceful and quiet with really ornate apartment blocks on different styles   Cons (very minor): - for room price, it would have been nice to‚Ä¶"
August 2015,Great hotel with very helpful staff,Stayed one night at this hotel.  Great location for Hyde Park and Kensington Palace and Royal Albert Hall - all within easy walking distance. Staff were very helpful and certainly made us very welcome.  Always on hand to help without being overbearing.  Food in the restaurant was outstanding - the crab ravioli was delicious!  My only wish was that I'd asked for a kettle for making tea so I could have had a cuppa first thing in the morning - this was complimentary but you had to ask for it to be brought to the room.  There was a tassimo coffee machine in the room but no instructions! Wasn't too worried though - would have preferred tea!
July 2015,Summer getaway,"The single best choice in hotels made this trip to London. In a city, where you're not starved for choice, The Belgraves proved to be a stand out selection and one we'll return to on our future trips to London.  From entry to exit a fantastic experience. The attentive and helpful doorman, the experienced and sharp staff at check in and concierge who was accessible and available when required all presented themselves well, while not becoming overbearing.  We were scheduled to check in at 3:00, yet arrived 2 hours early and while fully expecting to wait for our room, which seems to be typical for London, were refreshed to find the room available and allowed to check in and freshen up prior to heading back out. We recognize this may not always be possible, however were extremely‚Ä¶"
July 2015,Fabulous Hotel Experience,"The Belgraves London Hotel is one of the best hotel experiences ever. The room design and quality is top notch and the friendly professional service is truly outstanding. From the lobby to the restaurant to the gym and the room service, all details are expertly taken care of so you can enjoy a fabulous experience. The Belgraves will always be my first choice London hotel."
July 2015,A fantastic stay,"We had an overnight stay at the Belgraves Hotel and I can't rate it highly enough. On arrival the staff were very friendly and polite & we were made to feel very welcome. We were asked if we were celebrating an occasion & we told them it was our wedding anniversary.  We were congratulated and had our room upgraded and were given a complimentary bottle of champagne. This was the perfect start to our celebrations.  The room was great, very stylish as is the whole hotel. The bathroom was very nice with a great double shower.  The bed and furnishings were very comfortable and luxurious.  The Hotel is just a joy to be in, the dimmed lighting and amazing furniture give it such a cool feeling.  The bar area was good and we sat out on the terrace enjoying a couple of gin & tonics - nice‚Ä¶"
July 2015,Lovely and helpful staff,"I know hotel rooms in London are small but our room was tiny. So small in fact the first thing reception suggested to us was up-grading. Not the arrival I had been looking forward to.   The staff were all lovely and very helpful. The hotel is modern with a good vibe and a decent bar. Location is good for walking around Belgravia and Westminster. Its only a 10 minutes walk to Knightsbridge Tube and Harrods (boring and over rated).    Not somewhere I would rush back to, there was nothing wrong with it but I would rather try somewhere else on my next visit."
July 2015,Wimbledon Respite,"Most accommodating staff, well managed and we most appreciated our room being available to us upon check in after flying over from The U.S.  They also accommodated us for a late check out when I had the chance to play tennis on grass on our check out date and needed a quick shower.  Rooms and bathroom were kind of small, but it was close to The Sloan Station Tube stop, which we took daily to the matches.  Lots of great restaurants in the area and a fun, vibrant neighborhood of Belgravia."
July 2015,"Nice design, friendly service, great location.","We spent two weekends at Belgraves in just over a month and really loved our experience. This is slowly becoming our favourite place in London!  Staff is very friendly, rooms are nicely designed (loved the bathroom) and location is excellent, especially if you want to be in the Sloane Street/Belgravia/South Kensington area  During our second stay we had a room with view on the square which we preferred to the room we had during our first stay (at the back of the hotel, hardly any view and smaller). But I guess this is linked to the type of room we booked.  They also have a very good bar by the way, ideal for pre-dinner drinks or a nightcap.   We will certainly return.   "
June 2015,Perfect spot for our Wimbleton experience!!,Wonderful setting and service!  The staff is excellent ! They were all so willing to make our stay exceptional! The concierge service was exceptional! Diego and Violetia were the most helpful! Thank you for making our stay wonderful! Georgia Enright               
July 2015,Luxury,"I honestly can't recommend this hotel highly enough. My wife and I spent four nights and five days in London for my wife's 30th birthday, staying at this hotel in the heart of Belgravia.  The hotel was immaculate and the service was better than excellent. The staff couldn't be more welcoming or hospitable, they literally couldn't do enough for us!  There was complimentary drinks on arrival and they had a large chocolate brownie cake with 'happy birthday' scribed on it sent to the room.  We dined in the restaurant before getting a cab to the Queens theatre to see Les Miserables and the food and wine was delicious. Again, the restaurant staff were attentive and very welcoming.  We used the bar several times after a long days sightseeing and the beer was served perfectly chilled.‚Ä¶"
July 2015,it was very beautiful hotel.,"The rooms were so clean and so nice . staffs were very friendly and smile.it was not so far from the town.the price was not so expensive .if i have a free time ,i will go back to stay here again.and ,i think that,many people like it."
July 2015,"Excellent hotel, Brilliant customer service","I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and it was lovely, the rooms were clean and the views were amazing. I highly recommend the restaurant as well as they have brilliant customer service and the food is delicious."
July 2015,Nice hotel but service could be better,"The property is new and modern.  Rooms are a tad small (we booked a suite which is actually just a bigger room, with no separate sitting area).  Great location.  We were a bit let down by the service - some of the desk/ concierge staff did not appear to be very familiar with nearby places/ transportation.  We left something behind and when we emailed them 3/4 days later, they quickly responded saying that yes, some items have been found in the room.  Happy with the quick response, but it would have been better if they took the initiative to email us.  There was no breakdown of what had been left in the room.  Surprised to find that close to 130 pounds had been charged to my credit card for shipping without first notifying me of the shipping costs - what we left behind was a‚Ä¶"
June 2015,Mr Apolo vieira,I'd been there for my first time last July with my family. The staff was friendly and kind. Accommodations are good and localization is very convenient and charming as the hotel at all. I'd truly recommend the stay in this cozy place as a great refuge from the london's skyscrapers.
July 2015,"Great service, nice room and decent neighbourhood","We stayed in the hotel for 5 days. First the staff were helpful and provided great service from the moment we stepped in the room, and helpful with our enquires. The room is clean and tidy with some view at the higher floor. The location is a bit far from tube but is within walking distance to Sloane square/ Knight bridge/ Victoria. Pretty close to the high end fashion shops and Harrod's. The neighborhood is quiet and safe, and is actually quite near to foreign embassies. And it is also close to a little street with some pretty cool restaurants.   The bed is comfortable but the variety of pillow choices was limited, couldn't find a softer pillow during my stay."
July 2015,A lovely boutique hotel w/ very nice staff,We were resident for a week. There is no fault w/ the hotel. The staff is very nice and attentive. The breakfast is perfect. The rooms while a bit tight are well appointed and provide all one might seek. My only note is that one does have to walk at least 10 minutes to Knightsbridge and 20 minutes to Sloan Square. But a small price to pay for such nice company. We shall return.
June 2015,Outstanding service and great location,"The service extended to me by the Belgraves staff, in particular the front office management team of Parvez and Renata, was second to none. They went above and beyond their duties to ensure my stay was luxurious and hassle free.  The high service level and quality of the room gave the impression of a large 5-star luxury hotel but at half the price.  Would definitely return."
June 2015,Amazing service,"The hotel is centrally located for easy acces to Sloane street , Harrods and kings road. Service levels are second to none, they will assist and help with all requests.  Totally recommend The Belgraves."
June 2015,Redefining Luxury - Belgraves,"My experience at Belgraves, a Thompson Hotel was nothing short of superior.  It was so good I returned within 2 weeks.  My first stay I had a king premium room, which catered to my needs perfectly.  I spent a lot of time outside the hotel, but returning was an absolute delight.  The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive, without being pushy or overbearing.  The room was incredibly comfortable, perfect for relaxing after a busy day. When I returned a few weeks later I was able to enjoy the additional luxury of a studio suite.  It was so comfortable I spent more time at the hotel than I had originally intended.  One of my guilty pleasures is to have a bath before going to bed, so the well designed marble bathroom made this experience extra special.  I first booked‚Ä¶"
April 2015,Birthday treat and overdue break !,"5 star perfection in a gorgeous boutique hotel. The staff go out of their way to make you feel special and we instantly felt ""at home"".   The little added extras they put in really make a big difference! The rooms are stunning and we had the best nights sleep ever.  The bar had a great ambience,  burgers were amazing and the staff were friendly and attentive.   Breakfast really was fabulous and made even better with the service from Bryan the restaurant supervisor.   All the staff are happy and friendly & seem genuinely passionate about the service they provide -Anita & Laura stood out for us.   Highly recommend this hotel and can't wait to return!"
May 2015,Belgraves Thompson,"Beautiful modern boutique hotel. Great use of space in room. Can tell it was very thought out. Location good. Very nice wine and cheese hour from 6 to 7. Loved all the little ""extras"". Pricey, but I think Wimbledon made all  the rooms expensive."
April 2015,Visit to Belgraves,"I recently visited the Belgraves, during a short London business trip.  The hotel was an excellent choice, clean, well run and well managed.  I particularly pleased to have a room waiting after a night flight from the states.  The rooms were small, but clean, well appointed and remarkably quiet.  The staff was helpful and friendly.  The bar was an excellent choice for a pre-dinner drink and snack."
May 2015,Fantastic service ,Amazing service! Especially Niko!!! So much so I have to write about it!! The staff here are five star !! We have had the best time and the breakfast really is fabulous!!! We love it here!! We live next door and breakfast here all the time!!! The choice is excellent! 
April 2015,Best hotel in London,"I have stayed in many hotels in London. This was by far the best. We wanted to stay reasonably close to Hyde Park as we had tickets to BST... This did not disappoint. It was a short, pleasant walk to the park. In close proximity was Harrods, Harvey Nicholls and other designer shops. We were also in close proximity to several tube stations making it easy to get around to see the main sights in London. As for the actual hotel, our room was lovely. It was clean and well presented. It was quiet and comfortable. We tried room service, the burgers were the best we've ever had! Service and staff was outstanding. We were overwhelmed by the staff, they were friendly and could not do enough for you. Excellent customer service! The restaurant was also a pleasant experience. The quality of‚Ä¶"
April 2015,Fantastic experience!,The Belgraves is a smaller personalised Four Seasons experience.  The staff is exceptional.  The service is flawless.  They anticipate your needs before you can even verbalise them.  The location is prime.  It's a quick walk to Hyde Park and the local shops are upscale and easy to access as well as the many delicious restaurants.  
March 2015,Excellent in every aspect,"From the excellent location in Belgravia, to the chic contemporary yet comfortable rooms this definitely somewhere I will return to. Friendly helpful staff make this a very welcoming place.  Rooms overlooking Chesham Place have a view of the small park. Just a 10 minute stroll to Sloane Squareand Kings Rd in one direction and the same in the other direction to Harrids and Brompton Rd. Eas walking to Hyde Park.  Loved it. "
April 2015,"Comfortable, stylish, nice location","After a long week of business travel, I spent two nights at Belgraves on my own dime, extending my stay in London. Overall, my experience was very good. I would return to this hotel.  Location: Excellent, if you like to be away from the craziness, but within short walking distance of tube stations and major tourist sites. I discovered too late, but there is a small grocery store (Waitrose) two blocks away which is very convenient for snacks and beverages.   Room: Excellent. Stylish and comfortable, even if a little bit small. I had a room on the 10th floor sharing a wall with the elevator which I thought would be a problem, but it wasn't at all. The window opened and air conditioning kept things very comfortable.  Food: Excellent. Expensive, but isn't all of London?  Service:‚Ä¶"
March 2015,Warren Makes It Worth Your Money,"There are great hotel managers, and terrible ones.  Warren at Belgraves made it his personal mission to see that our family of 4 (here for business), requiring  2 rooms, would be comfortable for a 2 week stay. While our teenagers had to move rooms more than once, as space is very limited during events in London in June, Warren never made us feel petty about our preference for the kids to have two beds.  Further, he and all of the Belgraves staff were as family from Day 1 -- arranging great dentists for an emergency procedure; a lawyer/notary to close some US business, all the while we slept on the finest comfortable beds with luxury surrounds.  THEN..we were faced with a different Belgraves face -- one individual who not only was unpleasant, but insisted when our sons move rooms‚Ä¶"
March 2015,A great hotel,"My wife booked as a surprise for my 30th birthday and we had a lovely stay. Right from the outset the staff were very kind and friendly and took care of my wife who was 7 months pregnant. They upgraded our room and had a little birthday cake suprise for me as well.   The hotel is clean, smart and just the right size so they don't lose the personal touch. The room was great; very comfortable and smart.  It's in a fantastic location which is walking distance of most attractions, shops, bars etc and quiet enough so you can escape some of the hustle and bustle.   We only stayed for one night over a weekend but would definatly stay again and recommend to others.  The only thing we didnt make use of was the bar/restaurant because we had reservations booked elsewhere but it looked‚Ä¶"
December 2014,Wonderful place to stay!,"We spent 9 nights at the Belgraves.  It is a moderately priced hotel (for London).  The Belgraves is in a stunning neighborhood, within walking distance of public transportation, and has extremely helpful staff.   Our room was perfect. The hotel is in a quiet location, so traffic and street noise did not disturb us. The concierge helped us plan our daily itinerary; they made reservations, ordered a few tickets, and explained how to use the subway. With their assistance, we saw London on our own. We ate once in the restaurant; the food was very good.  Breakfast was not included in our room rate; we found a wonderful local restaurant (Patisserie Valerie) which was located just a few blocks away. The Belgraves does have some exercise equipment which is well maintained. We will‚Ä¶"
January 2015,Very friendly,"it was our first time and for sure we will visit the hotel again .  The stuf have a very nice vibe , they are very friendly .  I wish all hotels are like this . The room are very clean .  My kids love the place .it is a unic hotel .               "
March 2015,excellent lastminute booking,"Its usually pot luck when making a last minute booking, but this was a real treat. Excellent hotel, beautifully and very stylishly appointed, very attentive and polite staff, great room with excellent shower and view over the little green space at the crossroads. Not close to any tube stations but set in a quietish location. Would thoroughly recommend it."
February 2015,"Great hotel, very friendly staff",The hotel has a very nice style and the staff is very friendly and helpful. It is located in a lovely neighbourhood. Good value for money in London. I will definitely come back next time I'm in London
March 2015,Nice nights stay,"Stayed overnight whilst eating at Heston's ""Dinner"" about 1/2 mile away. Friendly check in staff, clean room, great location, nice continental style breakfast. quickly and efficiently resolved minor issues. Free parking overnight outside on the Sunday night we stayed! Would go again."
March 2015,Home Away From Home,"Just returned from another week at Belgraves in London. Whether it was being greeted by name by Riccardo when we got out of our car upon arrival, or the personal attention by all members of staff, we are always made to feel welcome and important when we are there.  The Concierge staff, Ben (Head Conceirge), Violetta and Diego, were extremely helpful and took care of all our needs with efficiency and a smile.  Our suite was spaciious, comfortable, clean and ready for us upon arrival. D√©cor is modern and cool.  We enjoy the area around Belgraves which is quiet for central London. We will return to Belgraves whenever we are in London."
March 2015,Outstanding!.... Expensive but outstanding!,"I took myself, my Mrs, Mum and Dad up to Belgraves for a surprise 60th Birthday Trip for my Mum. She'd always wanted to stay in a 5 star London hotel, so that's what we did!  Everything about this hotel was magnificent. The service from the moment we got to the hotel was perfection. So helpful and friendly, willing to literally do anything for you.  We were given a complimentary room upgrade due to it being my Mum's special birthday (both rooms upgraded!). The rooms were magnificent. Had everything you could ever possibly want in a hotel room but I wasn't really that surprised. I've stayed in quite a few 5 star hotel around the world so know generally what to expect and this one is one of the better, more 5 star worthy hotels! The bathroom was really nice and had a fantastic‚Ä¶"
March 2015,Beautiful hotel in a great location with very friendly and approcable staff.,"This hotel is located in the heart of Knightsbridge but isn't the least bit stuffy! D√©cor is gorgeous - very modern with interesting art scattered about. Room (King Size Deluxe) was a good size and as we'd requested an upper floor we had a good view (although it was a very windy day and there was a bit of noise from that). Bathroom was fabulous - bath big enough for 2 and loo screened off. Nice Ren toiletries were a bonus. Bar was very relaxed and a nice spot to while away an hour or meet up with friends. Special mention to the staff who were all - from reception to the bar staff, friendly, helpful but most of all very approachable."
March 2015,Bringing in london some piece of NYC,This hotel over met my expectations. I've been at the Miami one so I had some ideas on what to expect (less nice :-)) but the london one is super cool! Bar and the restaurant are very nice - but food is english only (not my favorite one). Rooms are not too big but still very comfortable. Not giving 5 stars because the open wifi (only option available) was too slow. Will definitely come back !
February 2015,"Great staff, relaxing stay!","Spent 5 nights at the hotel for a quick break from 27 March-1 April. Room was beautiful as usual - the hotel managed to give me my preferred room as I had wanted to stay in the room I stayed in previously. The staff was excellent as well. Everyone was friendly and warm and it was really nice to experience that, especially as I was travelling solo. My first morning, I overslept and missed by in-room breakfast order, but was offered breakfast at a later time once I woke up and the staff was very understanding. Also, the concierge managed to get me tickets to the sold out Alexander McQueen exhibition on short notice, which I appreciated.  The location is great, the hotel is comfortable and contemporary, and the staff is amazing. I really enjoyed my time here and look forward to‚Ä¶"
October 2014,Enjoyable Stay,This is a belated review of a short stay over the New Year. I booked 3 rooms via Lastminute and had a brief delay at check in when the hotel had only allocated 1 room. However this was quickly dealt with by check in staff and overall we had a pleasant stay at this stylish hotel. The location is excellent - a short walk to Harrods and Sloane Street and it suited us perfectly. Service in the bar could be better but perhaps we were just unlucky. Would stay again.
May 2014,Fashionable Hotel in Knightsbridge / Belgravia,"Stayed at the Belgraves for one night in January 2015 on our way home. Beautiful hotel located on the border between Knightsbridge and Belgravia. Be prepared to see Rolls Royces, Bentleys and Aston Martins parked on the street in front of the hotel.  Rooms are beautifully appointed, but quite small for two people. A bit of a struggle to move around in the room with two large suitcases. Bathrooms are very modern with a separate cubicle for toilet and the shower is a walk in open shower that looks out onto the bedroom with a nice rainfall. One complaint would be that the rooms are quite dark as well with the only good lighting in the bathroom. Walkable distance to Harrods and nice shops in the area.   This hotel is also very close to the Cabman's Shelter where you can get an egg‚Ä¶"
October 2014,"Fabulous property, great location!","Just spent 3 nights at the Belgraves in London.  VERY happy with the property, staff and restuarant (and room service!). Clean, well appointed and the location was in a lovely neighborhood close to Hyde Park and plenty of fabulous shopping.  Highly recommend this hotel - and would definitely return to the Belgraves Hotel."
October 2014,Most Excellent Hotel With Great Standards And The Best Staff Attention To Detail,"One of the best London based hotels I have ever stayed in.  There are too many chain hotels like Marriott and Hilton that just blend into bland.  This hotel is defiantly not that. It's stylish, well maintained and very individual.  I felt like true luxury was around me.  Congratulations to the hotel team.  You have a winner"
December 2013,Perfection across the board.,"After my second perfect stay @ The Belgraves, I just had to post a review.  From the moment you arrive, to the moment you depart, the staff @ The Belgraves makes certain that you want for nothing.  Front desk, concierge and bartender(s) all get special props! The care is hands-down the best you'll receive.  Not to mention the comfort of the rooms, many of which provide sublime, calming views over Belgraves Square.  Rooms are terrifically comfortable for working or just relaxing. (I especially love the international outlets.) It's also situated to all my favorite shops, and Knightsbridge tube station.  Needless to say, I can't wait for my next stay!"
September 2014,London Chic,"I stayed at Belgraves for one night and wish I could have been there for much longer! Camila at check in was very sweet and was able to check us in before the guaranteed time. The room was excellent, the bathroom massive, and I loved the bay windows with the lovely couch. The room was a nice size and quiet which was great. It had the great feeling of sophistication without being pretentious. I'll definitely be back!"
October 2014,Wonderful Birthday Surprise,"Until my son pulled up outside, I had no idea that I was going to the Belgraves for an overnight stay last Saturday as part of my 60th birthday celebration.  We had driven up from Somerset and arrived, as we thought, too early to book in but it seemed that it was no trouble to take our rooms early.  In recognition of my special birthday, we had all been upgraded to King Superior rooms, my husband & I on the front of the hotel overlooking the square on the 7th floor.  It was lovely!  Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff and they were friendly and attentive.   After a trip to Harrods, we returned to get ready for the theatre to find a beautifully presented chocolate birthday cake slice, complete with hand written message from the hotel, waiting - yummy!  It was a‚Ä¶"
October 2014,You couldn't ask for better,"The hotel is beautiful, chic and modern through welcoming. But it's all about the staff. Everyone there is engaged in helping you achieve whatever you need. I learned everything I needed to know to get to the financial district during peak hour from Brian in the restaurant. Kathryn helped me find hair products that I'd forgotten and took the time to find out what time the shop down the road opened so I could get there before my meeting. Nikki in room service created a special pot of tea for me when I arrived sick with the flu and took the time to check on me later. It's the best experience this business traveler has had in years. I will surely be back. I'm planning my next stay already. "
October 2014,Great staff and service,"Great location close to shopping on Sloane street. No excess luxury, the room was a little dark, the mattress could have been softer, and my bathtowel had a big hole in it. But the room was clean and comfortable enough, and we enjoyed our stay. Were upgraded to a Premium room, so avoided the glass wall between shower and bed (which is a stupid trend, I think). They made our bed twice a day, and we had fresh towels every time we returned. The best feature of this hotel is the top notch service throughout. Everyone very friendly, helpful and efficient. Did not have dinner at the hotel, but lunch, snacks and cocktails were very tasty. The breakfast was simple but good. Superfresh croissants. Would definitely stay again."
July 2014,Trendy laid back sophistication,"I've just got back from spending 3 nights at this wonderfully eclectic hotel. From the moment of arriving I felt welcome, fortunately my King Premium room was ready, lucky as my flight into London arrived at 7am. A stunning room with view over the park, everything was just right, free wifi, delightful blue LED lights in bathroom for night lights, REN toiletries and one of the most comfortable beds with proper pillows. The terrace is stunning, done in diiferent shades of grey with walls of green ivy, perfect for that glass of Savignon Blanc to meet friends after shopping at nearby Harrods, Harvey Nic's and Sloane Street. Each and every member of staff were so friendly, it felt more like being ""at home in London"" This is definetly a place to stay! Many thanks to all of you!"
November 2014,Excellent! Quiet Location but close to Everything!,"If you want a great hotel in a great location, then stay here.  The staff is very friendly, the concierge took care of our every need, and the room was very comfortable and had a great view (room 905). You're close to the Knightsbridge Tube station, and the walk is easy from many locations (we walked from Mayfair back to our hotel).  If you stay here, I would recommend lunch at The Pantechnicon (2 minute walk from the hotel), and breakfast at Harvey Nichols (about a 5 minute walk) was quick and delicious.  If you want chocolate or delicious macarons, go to Pierre Hermes (just around the corner).  My husband and I remarked every day what a great location the hotel was in. We'll definitely stay here again.  We were celebrating our anniversary and the Belgraves staff surprised us‚Ä¶"
November 2014,Lovely hotel for a suprise   trip to London!,"My partner booked this hotel for us to stay in whilst having a weekend away in London. Upon arrival we were greeted by lovely staff, our room was just lovely and we were provided with a bottle of champagne on ice! The cocktails from the bar were delicious, felt really lucky to be in such a lovely place. On our last morning we had breakfast In the hotel, very pricey but lovely. Will definitely return and will also check out their hotels in other countries. "
November 2014,Lovely hotel!,"Our trip to London was to celebrate my husband's 50th by having a meal at Petrus. The location of this hotel was just perfect for this as well as later when we went to Leicester Square as the tube station was only a 5 minute walk. We could not fault the service we received from the minute we arrived with friendly staff, valet parking (extra cost @ ¬£45  but worth it) and then later when we had been in the room (an upgrade to a king suite, room 402 - lovely!) for a while, a knock on the door to find a personalised piece of cake complete with candle being presented to my husband for his birthday, a really thoughtful touch that we appreciated. The hotel is really well presented, exceptionally clean and modern but still retaining an informal atmosphere thanks to the staff who‚Ä¶"
November 2014,What Hospitality is all about.,"I first stayed at the Belgraves in May of this year. I had a few unimportant issues about the room which I took the time to explain to the front desk staff when I checked out. I was pleasantly surprised when I received an email from the management the following day saying that they had been attentive to my remarks and that they would remedy the situation the next time around. When I booked a superior room three weeks ago, I was upgraded to a King Suite. I must say that this one of the few hotels where they go out of their way to make a customer feel special. The restaurant is very good and the staff very attentive and friendly. I would certainly recommend it."
November 2014,Convenient luxury,"I stayed here for one night before going to Oxford for a Harper's Bazaar event at the Chic Outlet Shopping village. No wonder they chose this hotel for international journalists to stay in. It's small and exclusive but it's also very sophisticated. Obviously it's located near Harrods, in a super posh neighborhood ... but it's also a walk away from London's amazing parks. I think it's great for just sleeping and dining... didn't look like much fun..and was even borderline boring.. for 1 night, it's great and convenient...but i don't think i would stay longer than that...for business, it's perfect. i did however, reallllllly enjoy the breakfast downstairs."
November 2014,Used to be a lot better,"Whilst the hotel itself is lovely and the rooms are great. There has definitely been slide for the worst in terms of the service.  Certainly you would expect more considering the price.  The staff seem to be all fairly new and there is a lack of ""character and charm"" about the service provided.    There are certainly better places in the area to stay....."
November 2014,A London gem!,"Stayed here recently on my wedding night! We had just one evening booked, and the staff made us feel like royalty throughout our stay! I love the whole Thompsons hotel group aesthetic, and this one of theirs in London is fabulous. Low key chic and quiet glamour are the order of the day. For us, after a long frenetic day- we collapsed into the lovely restaurant late in the evening- the manager and his waiters were fabulous- funny, cool and attentive. I'd highly recommend their burger, and don't be put off by the expense of the wines- they are more than worth it! All in all- this is one of london a coolest little hotels in what is unarguably one of the most gorgeous neighbourhoods of the city. Book now!"
November 2014,Luxurious hotel in a fantastic location,"We booked 2 rooms for a 1 night stay as we were moving to a larger apartment to accommodate our large family for a long stay in London.  Our rooms were luxurious, decorated in the highest manor. One of our rooms was an accessible room (for disabled) which meant the bathroom was overly large and spacious which helped with our kids.   The staff were all faultless. From the concierge, to the boys out the front, friendly reception staff and restaurant staff too.  The lobby is dark, sleek and impressive. First impressions do count and The Belgraves got it right.   We had dinner in the restaurant because our kids were tired after a long day of travelling from the Netherlands and we were blown away by the friendly service, speedy delivery of the food, recommendations from the staff and‚Ä¶"
June 2014,"Great hotel and location, consistently enjoyable","I have stayed at the Belgraves 3 times in the last 6 months, always for business, and it has been consistently wonderful.  The location is amazing, a few blocks behind the Berkeley Hotel but half the price while still close to Sloane Square and Harrods/Harvey Nichols.  The hotel decor is stylish and offers a nice bar and separate restaurant.  The rooms are terrific ~ newly decorated with white marble bathrooms, rooms have cosy/natural/sexy/lightly masculine decor ~ and the gym is very good too.  The only thing missing is the lack of a spa, but it's hard to have everything.  The staff is highly professional in every capacity (front desk, spa, concierge, room service).  I'll definitely be staying here again."
November 2014,Consistently good,"I have stayed in the Belgraves several times and am really pleased to make the same consistent quality experience every time.  The staff is extremely well trained and go out of their way to be helpful, from reception, concierge, events, to room service and bar. The rooms are very cosy and well designed, and always impeccably clean, often with a nice view to the communal garden and square.  The breakfast and lunch is delicious and offers many healthy options, no unusual request has been declined.   All the above has made the Belgraves my favorite London hotel."
July 2014,Designed for sensuality,"We stayed for just one night, regrettably... It was such a beautiful hotel - I would have loved to stay longer!  The room was gorgeous, plush and chic, comfortable and inviting, with great attention to detail.  In keeping with most London hotels, the room was not large although certainly not cramped, and it was beautifully designed.  The bed was one of the most fabulously comfortable beds I've ever slept in, and we both had a fantastic night's sleep.  However it was also one of the most perfect beds for playtime too!  The bedlinen is fabulous and all adds to the sensuality of your stay.  One review I read commented on the dim lighting, but for a romantic sexy stay the lighting simply added to the deliciously sensual experience.  Loved the big mirror over the bed, loved the sexy‚Ä¶"
June 2014,Another excellent stay,really can not fault this hotel. The staff are laid back but very attentive. Best nights sleep I've had this year!  Great breakfast.  Steak wasn't ideal but didn't spoil my trip. Look forward to returning next year
June 2014,Great hotel!,"This was my second time staying at the Belgraves this year and the hotels did not disappoint! Great location, rooms are very nicely appointed, staff is amazing! Location is on a quiet street but close to everything.  I highly recommend."
June 2014,Excellent service,We spent a weekend in London at this hotel recently and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. It's a nice mix of upmarket chic and friendly staff. Plus it's in a great location for west end destinations.  The staff are lovely and the service is excellent. I would recommend the Belgraves for a shopping or sightseeing weekend in town.
June 2014,business trip,A very nice surprise as I did not know the hotel. Great atmosphere. Nice crowd. Great design. Friendly and impeccable service. spacious room and great bathroom. Has parking. Good food at the restaurant.
June 2014,Best Spot in London,Walk distance to tube station and many attractions. Staff is very helpful and friendly. 3min walk to a starbucks!:) Concierge service is brilliant they arrange everything for you and they haven't disappoint us. Will be back again for sure! 
June 2014,Superb hotel with top top service,"My wife and I stayed here for one night ona lastminute.com top secret deal and we were delighted with the choice that we had made. Although the bedroom wasn't the biggest (typical central London), teh king size bed was very comfortable and we had all of the luxuries you would expect from a 5 start hotel. The bath was huge, the complimentary toiletries were lovely but best of all the service was first class. Although everybody from concierge, the bar and reception were brilliant I'd like to highlight Bryan, who served us at breakfast as a great example of how service should be delivered. He was out of this world, very courteous, couldn't do enough for us and had time for a brief chat. We'll definitely be staying here again. Thank you Belgraves. Oh, and teh 1200 checkout was‚Ä¶"
June 2014,Overall very nice hotel in quiet well-located neighborhood,"The hotel is new, and very tastefully appointed. Hip but quiet. Nice bar, limited restaurant service, but you don't want to eat in your hotel when you are in London anyway ! The rooms are very nice, on the smaller side, but spacious enough. The only real complaint I would have is the lack of light in the room, it is almost funny it is so dark, like the designers forgot about it, when the hotel was build... I would go back, great location, quick access to all London has to offer."
May 2014,"Elegant, Understated, Sublime","This has got to be one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. Let me tell you why‚Ä¶  With none of the pompous airs of larger hotels, this gem caters to guests who seek and appreciate the best things in life, but shy away from the ostentatious flash and vulgarity of conspicuous consumption.  At first sight, the hotel looks like a regular, smallish boutique hotel. But, as you begin to experience your stay, you become aware of all of the attention, refinement, and care that go into making sure the experience of every guest is simply fantastic.  Only items and products of the highest quality are used to furnish the rooms and bathrooms. I especially loved the richness of the towels and bathrobes. Room service is a real treat‚Äìfrom the presentation, cutlery, and linens, all the‚Ä¶"
May 2014,Restaurant ,"We did not stay at the hotel despite having seen one of the rooms. We enjoyed a lunch at the restaurant and have to say that despite being empty, the food was absolutely delicious and the staff very friendly. I seriously recommend this place for a quiet lunch and the heart of Belgravia."
May 2014,Stunning Hotel...,"The Belgraves is one of the most stylish hotels I have stayed in and I will definitely be recommending to anyone looking for a room in London.  The rooms are super 5* and have a chic, modern look.  The location is fantastic, and only a short walk away from the amazing shops Belgravia and Sloane Street have to offer.  The bar at the Belgraves has the most perfect atmosphere for relaxing and sipping cocktails with friends, and the staff are exceptional.  I will be a frequent visitor!"
May 2014,Posh Belgravia without any pretense,We stayed three nights at the Belgraves at the end of our UK trip and it was absolutely perfect.  We were upgraded from a superior to a deluxe room on the 9th floor.  We had a small balcony with a great view of the London Eye -- spectacular day and night.  The hotel is a convenient walk to Sloane Square and the Tube as well as lovely shopping on King's Road Chelsea.  Only one small hiccup that was solved amazingly well.  The chambermaid mistakenly threw out an item that was not trash and the hotel actually found it!  Incredible above-and-beyond service.  Special recognition to the concierge staff as well.  Everything was professional and lovely.  Make sure to walk to Motcomb St. for lunch at Ottolenghi and to Thomas Cubitt for a charming gastropub experience.
May 2014,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel for 1 night on a Saturday, had booked a King Superior room but was given a complimentary upgrade to a King Deluxe room upon arrival, wonderful! All of the staff were lovely and made us feel very welcome during our stay. The room was absolutely spotless, stylish and very spacious. The whole hotel had a very luxurious feel to it without being pretentious or trying too hard. Will definitely be returning to this hotel when next in London!"
May 2014,Private Party,"I recently celebrated my 40th Birthday at Belgraves and I couldn't have hoped to find a better venue or service in central London. The Snug area of the bar was allocated to us all evening, and the drinks and canapes flowed! There were 42 people in attendance and everyone commented on the quality of the food and the charming nature of the people looking after us. Throughout the whole event, including the planning, I was very well taken care of, and thank you to everyone for making it a very special event. A special thank you to Marianna who is the perfect party planner. I'm now trying to think of another cause for celebration so that I can come back!"
May 2014,Fantastic Hotel...but....,"I am giving the Belgraves a 5 star rating,  The hotel is fantastic... from the door staff (dressed casual) to the check-in, everything is perfect,  You are treated like a friend, not a customer.  In fact, this is what makes the hotel so special.  In London i have never met so hospitable staff,,,well done to all.  The room was a great size for London and quite funky (jellied sweets in the mini-bar...mmmm).  However, the air conditioning was an issue.  It was the hottest day of the year and the air-con was not working - if you turned it on it was set at 30 degrees.  my room was like a sauna.  I did mention this to reception on day 1 and they said there was major works going on and would be sorted that night...unfortunately not!  Despite this, i would not hesitate to recommend this‚Ä¶"
April 2014,You Have To Stay Here !,"I booked this hotel at the last minute for a weekend in the capital.  The Belgraves is one of the coolest hotels I have every stayed in, and I couldn't recommend it enough to anyone who wants relaxed luxury in one of the most beautiful areas of London. The service, ranging from' the most stylish Doorman you will ever see' to the Bar Hostess, from the Breakfast Waitress to the Receptionists local knowledge was exceptional.  It is a rarity to be acknowledged so openly by all members of staff, which speaks volumes for the hotels' ethos of excellent customer service. The rooms were spotless and extremely comfortable with everything you would expect in luxury hotel. You need to put The Belgraves on your ""must go to"" list..........."
April 2014,Best luxury hotel in London,"The Belgraves is a sleek, trendy and unique hotel in the posh Knightsbridge neighborhood in London. It ticks all the boxes: great food, amazing design, perfect location and friendly service...if you are not on a budget, obviously! The rooms are very comfortable despite being quite small, so I would recommend to opt for a king premium or a studio suite. One of the great assets of this property is its bar located on the mezzanine floor, which is the perfect place to work, meet, chill, eat and sip a drink, not to mention its beautiful, yet friendly and professional, waitresses."
February 2014,My favourite hotel in London!,"The best value-for-money hotel in town, in my view. This hotel is highly recommended for its cozy, modern, clean rooms, the high-level of services offered by the extremely friendly staff and of course its hidden gem: the terrace! I've stayed there in my last 4 business trips to London and it almost felt like being at home! Looking forward to my next stay there Highly recommended even for business travelers!"
April 2014,My favorite hotel :),"Really it's was a very nice night's with a Thompson hotel I extremely recommend this hotel for everyone looking for modern ,cleaning,friendly,amazing and wonderful hotel. Everything was over my expectation hotel staff never find  like them they are amazing,location,rooms, cleaning, lounge and wifi."
January 2014,Amazing time,"We had a amazing time, When we arrived we were upgraded to a better room which was great, had a great view from the balcony of the London eye and Big Ben!  We then asked if we could have the full English breakfast instead of continental and pay the difference, but to our surprise we didn't have to pay for the difference and this was included! Absolutely great environment/ atmosphere and the room d√©cor was really nice. It was a surprise for my partner and he loved it! Thank you for being so kind and courteous!"
October 2013,Great Place,"Cozy, modern rooms, nice location, and wonderful staff highlight the Belgraves.  We stayed for our 30th anniversary and our first visit to London, and it was a really nice place to call home for a few days.  We arrived early but they had a room ready for us with a nice view of The Shard and Big Ben.  Room Service made us breakfast ahead of the posted time several days in a row, and the restaurant and lounge were both top notch.  I would definately stay there again."
December 2013,Great Hotel....Great People,"We arrived at the hotel early, before official check in time.  Our allocated room was not ready so another room was found immediately.  This set the tone for the stay, nothing was too much trouble, the reception staff were friendly, helpful and interested.  The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the Knightsbridge tube stop in Belgravia.  The hotel is not at all pretentious, there is quite a chilled vibe.  The bar follows the same theme with guests and locals meeting here.  The interiors of the hotel are stylish in a modern way and the hotel must have been fitted out recently as the decor seemed fresh and new.  I went to see the Concierge to book some theatre tickets which she sorted out quickly and efficiently.  Whilst we were talking I mentioned it was our wedding anniversary.  When‚Ä¶"
December 2013,STAY HERE!!,Just a wonderful top notch hotel all around ... The best part was the staff and how accommodating they were.  Mathia and Anita were very warm and welcoming and everyone made me feel right at home.  The rooms are beautiful and well appointed.  The bar scene was very cool with a nice mix of locals and tourists!
December 2013,Great location and hotel!,"Great location, really nice friendly and helpful staff, good breakfast, great design, everything spotlessly clean and an excellent night's sleep as the rooms are so quiet.  Highly recommend the Belgraves and would like to return soon!"
December 2013,Really loved it,"Haven't stayed here but i did visit it! Lovely design, great restaurant and an even greater mesanin! The rooms are really nice and good size! They have all the utilities you need and the staff is extremlly friendly! Shout out to the girls from sales! Great hosts!"
December 2013,"Great Experience at Belgraves - Lovely hotel, great ambiance and charming staff","Really loved this hotel in a beautiful neighborhood...easy to get cabs fro hotel and easy walk to Sloane Square for shopping and the tube to get anywhere. This is a special hotel with welcoming staff and a great vibe. Room Service was excellent, and the hotel gave us a birthday cake for my daughter who was celebrating her 18th... Rooms are very well appointed, and the bed was extremely comfortable. No room in London is going to be vast unless you pay for a suite, but I found the room a good size, the couch nook was a nice touch. I love the location and the ability to walk through gorgeous squares and just enjoy the neighborhood. Super staff and super comfortable"
December 2013,Excellent Stay,"We stayed at Belgraves this weekend to celebrate our anniversary. From start to finish it was a brilliant experience. The staff are some of the most helpful and attentive I have experienced, they could not do enough for us during our stay. At check in, during conversation, the receptionist asked us the reason for our stay, we mentioned our anniversary, and when we came back from our day of shopping we had champagne on ice, fruit, and a note from the staff wishing us congratulations. Lovely touch. The shower was lovely, very modern design.  Overall, we had a really great time!"
December 2013,Friendly Unpretentious Vibe,"What I liked:  The location: 10 minutes walk to 3 tube stations. Knightsbridge, with its restaurants, shops etc is your oyster.  The check in: I arrived at 10 am and was given a room straight away. Others seemed to have a similar experience and my own room was serviced early while I was at breakfast. So there seems to be a better than average chance of getting an early room. Checking in and out were friendly and efficient.  The bar: Very inclusive warm vibe and top notch cocktails. It is a small bar. Though there are seating areas, I kept to the bar and had some very pleasant chats with friendly and interesting people. The bartender made great martinis of various kinds. The Vesper was of course shaken. The classic gin martini was of course stirred...(Yes, I do have childish‚Ä¶"
December 2013,Good value and modern,"Its a good value hotel, the rooms are a little small but modern and great location, ticks all the boxes. Its you want style on a budget this is it for sure, with a nice bar on the 1st floor for meeting etc too"
December 2013,Perfect Location,"We discovered this hotel through Visa Luxury Hotel Collection. Stayed here for 6 nights and were greatly impressed with location, friendliness and helpful of hotel staff. First location: it's in a quiet more residential neighborhood but walking distance to many attractions such as Buckingham Palace. It's also walking distance to Knightsbridge area and Slone Square for catching the underground which we did for getting to attractions further away. These locations were also good for dining and shopping. Also walking distace to Victoria Coach Station where we were to meet for a tour to Windsor Castle.  The staff always remembered us and were exceptionally polite. They arranged for a taxi for us at 5:30am when none were nearby. We also bought our Tower of London tickets there saving‚Ä¶"
November 2013,"Outstanding service, amazing view","It was difficult to pick the three best things about the Belgraves.  From beginning to end the service was outstanding. The room was very comfortable, maybe a little the small side (normal by London and New York standards) the use of mirrors and the amazing window overlooking West London gave the feeling of openness and space. We were on the 10th floor and the view was breath-taking at night. I would also highly recommend staying in one night and trying the room service, it was delicious, by far the most diverse menu I have encountered. The locations is central, walking distance to Sloan Square and Harrods.  The bar served great drinks and was packed on the weekend.  The gym was well maintained and offered 3 cardio options, a mat area, free weights and a multi-use weight‚Ä¶"
December 2013,Fabulous hotel,I stayed with my daughter at Belgraves back in October and had a fabulous stay.  The hotel is super nice and all the staff are extremely helpful.  We were upgraded to the King Suite which was so nice.  I would definitely stay here again
December 2013,great location,"- the hotel is super nice/ good taste -  in a great location - great views from the top floor - issues : not all the bathrooms in the standard rooms sea the same - the configuration of the bathroom in room 908 is non completely comfortable,  quite off!t he shower has a angle , so the actual area tos gower is quite small and narrow and dark! - the other room and i stayed before was different and comfortable -  this was the deal breaker for me  not sure if it is because of the fire place in the lobby to because of the smoking bar, but couple of days to smell of cigarette in the hallways was intense/ unacceptable  for a hotel listed as a non smoking hotel-- maybe someone was smoking in his/her room?  - staff is friendly and helpful  - continental breakfast is excellent, good‚Ä¶"
December 2013,"Stylish, Friendly and Great Location","We stayed at the Belgraves for New Years Eve and had a great time. The staff were helpful and friendly as soon as we stepped through the door. The rooms are very modern and stylish but also comfortable and inviting. The location was great for us, a short walk from both Sloane Square and Knightsbridge - there's lots of nice boutiques, restaurants and cafe's hidden here which is great. We spent a lot of the evening in the hotel bar which was fantastic! Great decor, super cosy and delicious cocktails. If you are staying here, be sure to check it out for a drink.  Belgraves is a fabulous and friendly hotel with lots of style."
November 2013,Super London Hotel,We stayed at the hotel in the run up to Christmas staying in their Penthouse suite which was very spacious separate lounge and dinning room which was very helpful. The suite had three bathrooms with fantastic views over the London skyline. In a nice quiet area walking distance from Knightsbrige shopping area and Sloan square. The staff were of the highest standard very professional and helpful we had a wonderful four nights at Belgraves and the food was suburb. A hotel I would recommend to high end travelers.
November 2013,Brilliant weekend at Belgraves hotel between Christmas and New year,"Had a lovely stay at the Belgraves Hotel for the weekend between Christmas and New Year.   We (2 parents, one 13y old son) arrived early on Saturday to drop off our luggage, and immediately received a very warm welcome by the friendly and efficient staff at the reception. This was an excellent way to start the day. The entire hotel is beautifully decorated, the lobby and lounge bar provide a cosy private club or even private living room atmosphere, the rooms are efficient and stylish.  The decoration of the entire hotel together with the staff genuinely makes you feel at home. After a day filled with shopping and sight seeing, we met with friends (2 parents, one 3 year old) who live in London, at the hotel and went for dinner in the hotel restaurant.  Not only was the food‚Ä¶"
November 2013,Fantastic hotel! Excellent customer service! A gem!,"How refreshing to find a chic hotel with excellent levels of service, comfort and dining that strive to make each customer feel special.  We can't wait to go back as we didn't want to leave.  It was all perfect from a Bellini in the lounge style bar (that was more like sitting in a gallery) to the most comfortable bed in very quiet rooms (even on New Year's Eve!). The Pont Street Restaurant provided the most beautiful brunch and the Cornish crab cakes Benedict were both creative and delicious.  Our lastminute.com gamble on an unknown hotel was not a gamble at all and gave us a beautiful memory of a New Year's break.  Thank you Belgraves Hotel. We will be back!"
October 2013,great weekend !!!!!well done,"have just returned from a great weekend in london staying at the Belgraves .The hotel was situated in a really convenient location ,we received a very warm and proffessional welcome.our rooms were ready early and we could unpack and get straight on with the shopping!!!!!!!the rooms were well decorated and clean with great design flourishes and lots of extra attention to detail to make our stay comfortable.the staff were all really helpful and we felt that nothing would be too much trouble!!!!even when i rang when i got home and realised that i had left something behind in the room !!!!! the cleaning staff had handed it in and it is now on its way back to me !!!! well done to all concerned!!!!   a great hotel !!!!!one to go back to !!!!!!!!"
September 2013,Great night,I was yesterday with a bunch of people the first time at the bar. First we where outside in the cigar terrace which was truly amazing. Afterwards we moved inside and I have to say many thanks to Abigail who looked after us so well the whole night. We will come back ! 
August 2013,A nice city brake,"What a lovely hotel, very smart. The rooms were cool and a weekend that was ment to impress most certainly did with this hotel. The day time bar tender didn't really know what he was talking about but drinks in the evening most certainly made up for it. Didn't eat dinner there but breakfast was good munch with a glass, or two, of champagne after a heavy night before. Easy to get to the main town. I would love to go back again. "
September 2013,Top,"Everything is good, welcome, front desk, porter, super friendly staff, smilling and ready to help. great room, clean well equiped and comfortable.  certainly one of the best hotel in london! Thank you I will be back"
September 2013,Back again,"Stayed again at the Belgraves while visiting my daughter and once again, felt very comfortable and happy with my stay.  The staff addressed me by my name immediately which is a big plus. My request for a room on a high floor was honored and I found myself in a quiet corner on the top floor--perfect!  I absolutely love the bar for a small salad in the evening with a drink beforehand so I was disappointed to learn that there was a private party scheduled the evening of my arrival! Had my drink in the lobby but really missed the tranquil ambiance upstairs.  Still my go-to hotel in London, eyes closed..."
September 2013,Saturday night treat,very nice hotel - everything spotlessly clean and the staff very helpful.  Breakfast very good and again staf very efficient. overall the hotel is beautiful - very modern.  But the room we stayed in was very small - a superior room with Kingsize bed - we had to shuffle around each other for space! We would stay again but definitely book a large room!
September 2013,First class,"We stayed here despite living in London - a night away from the kids with room service! I was incredibly impressed. The hotel has a lovely restaurant, great bar and incredible service: requests were dealt with incredibly quickly and efficiently and nothing was too much trouble. The staff from receptionists to concierge to doormen all care and go the extra mile. Prices for extras were reasonable given the location and quality. Its in a great location. As a London resident, I would recommend tourists to stay in this area rather than in Mayfair - everything is nearby (shops, museums, tourist attractions). It also appeared well equipped for business with good wifi and working area in the rooms. Excellent."
August 2013,Fun alternative to large chains,Usually stay at large hotels and tried the Belgraves.  Boutique feel with all the amenities. Room was small but with great layout. Convenient power outlets and good wifi for the business traveler. Very friendly and attentive staff. Restaurant had wide range of interesting options. Ceviche was outstanding
August 2013,A perfect experience,"It was on a total whim that we booked a night in this hotel for my wife's birthday.  (Thanks to the Impulse Deals on SecretEscapes.com. We arrived fairly late in the evening, although the bar was still open.  Being a little peckish, this was ideal.  Food options are amazing.  Service is prompt, but not in your face.  Food lives up to its description on the menu. Rooms are luxurious - from the bed linen, the toiletries, the thick fluffy towels to the glossy mags available in the in-room patio overlooking the square. We ambled downstairs the following morning, and were treated to a feast.  Great continental breakfast, and the cooked options are equally good.   One of the best omelettes I've had in a long time. There are so many distinguishing features to this hotel, but the art‚Ä¶"
July 2013,Stunning interiors,"This place attracted me with its interiors. The rooms really are swish. Marble clad bathrooms and smoked oak timber plus the most comfortable beds I've slept on in ages. The service was perfect everywhere from the door to the reception, the restaurant, bar and housekeeping staff stood out for their friendliness and willingness to help. I had a superb solo meal in the restaurant on the first night and was discreetly but so attentively served. Location is brilliant. Five minutes from sloane square. Highly recommended. "
February 2013,Perfect!,I've been in this hotel 2days ago.The staff was really kind and the room really clean with a great mini bar and a wonderful king size bed!!!!!I'm used to travel and in London this is the first hotel that I can recommend with no doubt!!!!!!
August 2013,fantastic night at the bar,"My friends and I had an amazing night at the Belgraves Bar.  The bar looks stunning, very stylish and classy.  First, we had some drinks on the outdoor patio, where we were served by this great italian waiter - Daniel. Unfortunately, the patio closed quiet early, so we had to move to the bar, which wasn't a big deal, because we immediately got another nice table, although they seemed very busy at that time. From there, we were served by this nice young lady Polia, always smiling and very courteous. She really took her time to recommend us a few cocktails, which were fantastic indeed! Later on, we ordered some food, which was a little bit disappointing. It was good, but just as good as any other bar food and a little bit too expensive. Afterwards, we wanted to buy some‚Ä¶"
June 2013,Great cocktails,"Went on a Thursday night with some fiends, for a quick nightcap, loved the place , great service and delicious cocktails ! i would defitnitely recommend the Belgrinni, really tasty and not too sweet .       "
May 2013,Wonderful Stay at Belgraves,"Normally I just use these sites to read the reviews but wanted to add my comments, Stayed at the Belgraves in a King Suite for a week with a small child, Hotel is excellent, modern, stylish but still family friendly. Staff was exteremly courteous and friendly. Cannot beat the location in a very quite and charming area but perfectlt situated in central London. Rooms are a bit on the small side but that was expected for central London. However, all rooms were beautifully furnished. Suggest booking the King Suite for a bit more room. I will definetely return and they made my London trip very special. Thanks Belgraves!"
June 2013,A gorgeous stay in a fabulous place,"What gem of a place. I wanted nothing more than a good night's sleep and I have to say I was blown away by this hotel. Amazing design coupled with a team of fabulous staff. Woke after a tremendously welcome sleep thanks to great comfy bed and gorgeous linen to the best view of London - ask for a high room if you can. The luxury detail here is worth every penny. If you're after a good design / boutique experience in a great part of town - book here.  Great bar too, great vibe. Thanks Belgraves."
June 2013,"Fantastic Stay, We Will Return","With little notice we decided to take a short break to London and after reading a review in Conde Nast Traveller decided to book The Belgraves Hotel.  This turned out to be a great decision!  A small boutique hotel, in a great quiet neighbourhood, very cool, smart, clean and welcoming.  Our room was small but very nice with everything we would possibly need. We found the staff to be very accommodating and genuine in there commitment to ensuring we had a great stay. Particularly when we went down for breakfast were the service was excellent and the young manager was all over the service ensuring everything was spot on, which it was. We had room service, which again was excellent and prompt. The Porters were pleasant and helpful and dealt with our car effortlessly.  Only slight‚Ä¶"
June 2013,Place to be visited by all,"I just moved near the area and was pleasantly surprised when I visited the Belgraves bar. I was warmly welcomed by a waitress and was well looked after for the night by ""Abegail"". I was unsure of what drink I wanted but Abegail recommended that I try a cocktail and to help me with my decision brought I few tasters which I highly appreciated. After my delicious cocktail I decided to sit at the bar where again I was well looked after by ""Pavel"" who was very knowledgeable and continued to serve me superb drinks. Overall I had an excellent evening which I didn't expect I'd have and ill defiantly be returning again very soon and spreading the word."
July 2012,A gem with some mini flaws,"The Belgraves is a gorgeous updated modern small boutique hotel that we could love if not for a few flaws.    At this price range we should not have to plug our hair dryer into the outlet in the bedroom and use the mirror over the bed.  The restaurant tries hard but the service is slow and the food is just adequate at breakfast. And, we'll even forgive them for the total technology breakdown of the day as this can happen to anyone. Finally,  unless you're 200+ lbs, you will need help to open the sticky front door. Lol. Staff are helpful and attentive at all times. We would go back as this hotel is close to everything  'downtown'."
May 2013,"Yes, this is a good one","I usually don't really bother about reviewing places... but I must admit that I use this website to get a feeling of places I stay at. Well, I thought, this time, instead of always using without giving back, I'll do the right thing. So, here it goes: The belgraves is a beautiful hotel. If you like to stay in cosy, nicely designed places, as I do, this hotel is for you. Gorgeous ambience generated by judiciously chosen ambi-light, nice palette of colors, select furnishings, wood under your toes, marble bathroom. I loved it. Go for the king premium. The staff is tip top, nice and smiling, as it should be but rarely is. The location is fantastic. The restaurant is good too if you don't want to move too much, but really, why wouldn't you move? this is London! My feeling as I left‚Ä¶"
May 2013,A fine stay,"It was a last minute decision and not sure if it was the right one.  However, upon arrival our expectations were satisfied and s igh of relief that we did make teh right decision.  The studio suite we stayed in was wonderfully spacious enough for our toddler girl to feel at home and the bathroom was excellent.  What I liked was the two cubboards so my wife and I didn't have to share.  The amount of light in the morning coming into the room once the blinds were opened is welcoming and the view is marvelous.  The location of the hotel is very convenient as well as peaceful.  Everyone was friendly and helpful.  All in all a very pleasant stay."
July 2013,At home in Chelsea,"The Belgraves is one of these really nice surprises, unique in its genre, located where you would expect it the least. It has the personality of a Kensington trendy hotel with the luxury of a Mayfair palace. Our room was a Junior Suite over looking the small private park. We loved the bathtub enclosed in glass and allowing you a peak at the city. The location is ideal for those who want a proximity to every tourist attraction but want the feeling of retiring to their residential neighborhood at night. The food was great. Indian and Continental flavors on the menu. A hype bar, busy but not overcrowded. And a short stroll to Amaya, our favorite Indian 1 Michelin star restaurant. A final touch is the cool looking doorman / butler, always ready to fetch something for the kids in a‚Ä¶"
July 2013,"Good, but the devil is in the detail!","Won a stay at Belgraves through Mr and Mrs Smith and so went with high expectations.  First impressions were great, we arrived early and so our room wasn't ready - not a problem as we checked in anyway leaving our bags  and set off to see the sights. Staff were helpful, making sure we had everything we needed when we checked in and directing us to the nearest tube station (about five minutes away in Sloane Square).  When we got back everything was ready for us and we were shown to our room. The room was good and all we expected from a high end boutique hotel. Great view looking over London towards the river - St Paul's, The Eye, The Shard all in view. Now the first criticism - excellently stocked mini bar including some pleasurable items from Coco de Mer but no tea and coffee in‚Ä¶"
July 2013,Great stay,"London is last leg of our Europe holiday and I must say that it ended with a bang with our stay at Belgraves.  Belgraves is a small luxurious posh boutique hotel. Very conveniently located (nearest station is either Knightsbridge or Sloane Sq, about 5-7mins walk). Staff members made a load of difference -  always welcoming and quick to ask if we need anything.   The room is of good size with contemporary and stylish interior design. My only gripe is that the lights are bit dim. The bed is totally totally comfortable which is so important after a long day out. The bathroom is great and the amenities are sufficient.  By the way, the hotel is near to Harvey Nichols and many other luxurious brands. Another plus point.  Will definitely recommend it!"
June 2013,Fantastic Hotel,"Having stayed at the Roosevelt in LA and The Thompson in NY, I know this chain, so was keen to try The Belgraves.  I booked directly from Sydney and spoke to a delightful French girl called Camille.  She was the first person I met when I arrived at 6am on a Wednesday morning.  From the moment I walked into the hotel, nothing is too much trouble for this groovy, young, but very professional group of staff.  Everyone remembers your name from reception, down to the young guys at the main entrance.  The two young waitresses in the bar are just a delight and everyone has a really friendly demeanour about them. I opted for the Deluxe room and wasn't disappointed, although I stayed in one with only a shower for the first week, the second one had a bath, which I preferred.  My room had‚Ä¶"
July 2013,Perfect Hotel,"We really enjoyed the stay and every detail of the hotel. The hotel is located very central and close to almost everything, but situated at a calm spot. I can fully recommend the hotel and the location."
June 2013,wonderful week at Belgraves,"Greeted with smiles by everyone,my husband and I felt welcomed and comfortable from Day 1.Concierge and staff made arrangements,suggestions and gave info that made our week flow flawlessly. Delightful morning breakfast started our day of sightseeing and we returned to the Belgraves to relax in the stylish lounge over drinks and enjoy wonderful nights sleep. The quiet elegance of Belgravia added to the overall atmosphere. The staff's attentiveness, professionalism and friendliness truly made staying at Belgraves and our week in London memorable."
April 2013,Hotel Excellence,"Belgraves is a perfect example of excellence.  From the crisp, clean and contemporary decor through to the clear customer orientated team, we can highly recommend.  My husband and I visited recently for a weekend to celebrate our wedding anniversary and it was a fantastic experience from beginning to end.  The staff are very friendly and personable without being insincere or intrusive, this balance can be difficult and they had it just right.  The suite was perfect.  The space was nicely laid out, plenty of room to move around, the views through two aspects were incredible and the bed very comfortable."
June 2013,"Funky hotel, young staff, great location, small rooms","Ive stayed in this hotel on business and for a romantic anniversary. For business I wouldn't really recommend it but otherwise it is a great hotel with the following benefits: - incredible location  - good value for its proximity to things - friendly staff - views are nice if you ask for the higher floors - funky hotel lounge/bar with a great outside terrace - good food at hotel restaurant/room service  Disadvantages: - rooms are small (dont be fooled by the way they name each room. i.e. standard room is called ""King Superior"") - they charge for internet!!! - not very generous (we were celebrating our anniversary and they had promised to take care of us, i did not get an upgrade nor any gift, bottle of wine, roses, chocolate, nothin!!) - they add service charges on your final‚Ä¶"
June 2013,Fav hotel in London!,"After staying in hotels all over London this is my very, very favorite! I love the small cozy feel of this hotel and its rooms.  The hotel is also located in Belgravia, which quickly became my favorite area of London.  Belgravia is not only beautiful on its own (surrounded by gorgeous white homes, unique boutiques, cute little restaurants), it is also just a quick walk to Knightsbridge (where Harrods and other high-end shops are located) and Buckingham Palace.  The rooms are a bit small (typical for Europe), but very comfortable....and not to mention, the bathrooms are gorgeous. Also very clean and new rooms...felt like an American hotel with a European soul.  Everyone at the hotel was very helpful -- great at recommending restaurants and activities.    Quick tips:  1.‚Ä¶"
June 2013,"Small, but Well Appointed and Luxurious","After many years of staying at the St. Martins Lane, I decided to give the Belgraves a chance, given that it is close to my office.   I was surprised by just how small the property was when I arrived, but what it lacks in size, it makes up in service and comfort.   Tucked away in the middle of upscale Belgravia, the location is short walk from Sloan Sq. and Victoria tubes, as well as a number of cute neighborhood bars, restaurants, coffee shops and pubs.  The service here was extremely warm and helpful.  There is always someone around to help you and they are on top of their game without being too overbearing.   The standard rooms are small, but typical by London standards.  I was impressed to see that they were able to fit in a sitting area, desk and queen sized bed while still‚Ä¶"
February 2013,"Bar at Belgraves, a good time had by all.","My friends were taking me out for my Birthday, and they brought me to the belgraves hotel bar, which is a very stylish bar indeed.   the staff recommended we sat around in the snug they called it. a great place for small group.  the staff were excellent and efficient. the selection of whiskeys were among the best i had seen, and several of them went down beautifully.  the onion and balsamic popcorn they give out was amazing, the truffle one were not im afraid to say.  All in all a lovely little bar and i will be returning, mainly due to the friendlessness of the waitresses."
May 2013,"Liked everything about it, and will go back soon.","My wife and I stayed at Belgraves last weekend while passing through London.  We had stayed in (and liked) the prior hotel at this address, but had not come since Belgraves opened.  This is an excellent, thoroughly modern hotel whose staff members are cordial, capable, and eager to provide go service.  On arrival, we needed a good bit of assistance, which desk and lobby staff provided promptly.  Things worked as they should throughout our stay.  Our room was altogether comfortable.  We had a pleasant view of Belgravia Square.  We ate two breakfasts in the hotel, both excellent and both well served.  London is never inexpensive, but Belgraves' prices seemed fair to us, and consistent with the market.  We will go back soon."
April 2013,Unexpectedly cool,"Stylish and sophisticated in this previously staid corner of Belgravia, this Hotel covers all the bases. The rooms are chic and sleek. The interior design is contemporary yet comfortable. The beds are sleep inducing and I cannot wait to come and stay again. Breakfast was delicious too, by the way. I have never seen such an extensive menu at that time in the morning! Welcoming staff for whom nothing is too much trouble."
April 2013,Loved the Hotel,"Let me start with saying i LOVE Thompson hotels  and the Belgraves was no exception. Wonderful ambiance, the entire staff was very nice and helpful, room service is typically quick, fun bar/lounge upstairs... food was delicious weather it was room service or in their restaurant.  Everyone greets you hello and is quick to ask if you need anything.  It's a little bit of a walk to the tube (closest is Knightsbridge) but it's in a great location, pubs around, lots of great (expensive!) shopping. Loved the electronic blinds and they do a wonderful turndown service.  Would stay again and they definitely add that nice personal touch during your stay. Would definitely return."
April 2013,Their Staff May My Stay,"Having stayed at hotels around the world, I'm often surprised by the lack of interest that many hotel staff show in their customers and in their profession. No such problem at Belgraves, the team from the front desk, restaurant, bar and events team were amazing - great personalities, top of their game.  The hotel was comfortable, well set and felt like home. I was there for a meeting and we couldn't have asked for more from the events team. Thanks to everyone for making our stay memorable."
April 2013,"Great location, everything else is average","4 point review: -You cant beat the location, right in the center of town a short cab ride from victoria and a short walk to Hyde Park.  -The rooms are small (even by city standards) and I was quite surprised by how low the ceiling is! The bed is comfy and there is really nothing else of note in the room. No tea/coffee maker  -The service levels are good, I do think they did get stuck in between trying to seem very young & funky and at the same time keeping up traditional standards of service. Dont think they have got their act together yet - One annoying bit, everytime I ordered room service the would commit for 20 minute delivery time (which is very fast) but would end up delivering in 30-40 minutes which is normal. Why make the promise if you consistently fail?"
March 2013,Good job,"I stayed at Belgraves for one solid week in April for an event. I also booked some friends there at the same time for greater convenience. They gave me a great room with a view, the service was excellent. It's got a buzzy hotel lobby with switched-on staff. While they showed me no price flexibility, they really delivered the goods and I would be happy to go back. Unbeatable location, minutes from Sloane street."
February 2013,Top dollar location...shame about hotel,Stunning location...just behind eaton sq not far to harrods....elegant boutique type of place...trendy...porters wear ranch hand type of clothes...nice staff at reception.....room very nice but dark...down lighters had been blanked over making it impossible to get made up etc....window blind wouldn't stay up which didn't help light situation...shower door made terrible cracking noise...very alarming...no tea/coffee facilities ...no water provided after first night...room not turned down on second night and not even made on day three...window would not shut...keeping you awake at night...wifi ¬£15/25 per day...please we are in 21 st century....bar shut sat night for private function...the only bar....no breakfast included..grand total ¬£1454 for a bed....how can they justify‚Ä¶
March 2013,Boutique possibly at its best,"I stayed at the Belgraves last week for work and thoroughly enjoyed my stay based mainly on the service provided by the staff. Upon check-in, I was provided with a thorough description of the hotel's amenities and benefits in a way that encouraged me to feel very welcome. I even received a follow up phone call about 30 minutes after check-in to confirm that everything in my room was to my liking. Throughout my stay, I was greeted by my last name and asked about how my day was going or if I needed any additional assistance.   The room itself had all of the little touches that you would expect at a great hotel, including an fine REN toiletries, high threat count towels and bedding. The wifi and in-room technology (tv, stereo, lighting) worked consistently without fail and was‚Ä¶"
March 2013,Excellent Choice in Prime London Area,"This is a very nice hotel in the Westminster area. Clean, modern & efficient. Comfortable rooms, however, are rather sparsely appointed. Convenient to many embassies, Hyde Park & government offices. Top notch restaurant (reviewed separately). Good breakfast. Great staff. "
January 2013,My favourite London hotel,"I have been to London several times, but this is definately my favourite hotel now. The service is great, the hotel interior is stylish, but not too ""designed"" with a warm and friendly atmosphere. The location close to Knightsbridge and Sloane Square could not be better. And above all i never slept so good before. These beds are a dream! Thanks to the whole staff for a wonderful stay!"
March 2013,"Chic, Modern Luxury","Stayed in this hotel for two nights at the end of February, and was glad to have picked it. It is definitely a five-star hotel, without being stuffy.The service was fantastic, the staff were polite and attentive but not snobbish. The hotel has a nice atmosphere - it is trendy and chic - but also relaxed. Our room was clean, light and spacious (for London). It had an enormous shower with an overhead ""rainshower"" function, which was great.  Location wise it is around a 10 minute walk to the King's road so it is a great location but it is very quiet at night for central london. Hopefully we will be back soon!"
January 2013,Much too expensive compared to what you get....,"Stayed in this hotel for the first time this weekend and I¬¥m not impressed.....  My husband came a day earlier and was told that his only card was not working (this card was used all over London the whole week....) When I came the next day I wasn¬¥t even greeted before I was asked for my credit card to pay my husbands bill. (the other nights were prepaid) My husband felt treated like a criminal..  So to the hotel itself. Positives: Very good location, nice bar. Negatives: Tiny rooms, nothing extra (no coffee/tea etc), cheap quality small towels. Out of our three nights we had a turn-down service once! One evening (they came 18.30) we asked them to come back in an hour (they did not) and next evening they did not show up at all... This happened also to our friends in next room. ‚Ä¶"
December 2012,Superb,"I can only agree with many of the other reviews about this hotel, it sets standards of service that you will struggle to find anywhere else...at any price.  When i booked i mentioned that it was for my wifes birthday, which was obviously taken note of as they had kindly left a delicious personalised birthday cake and a bottle of champage in our room.   The room itself, a Thompson suite, was on the 10th floor and afforded us magnificent views across London. It was very tastefully decorated, and the bathroom was big and luxurious.   The staff were fabulous at every level, and we were always addressed by name whenever we entered or left the building...which is always a very nice touch.  We found the location to be really convenient for us, it was a few minutes walk from some great‚Ä¶"
December 2012,"Average Hotel, Wanna Be Hip, in a Great Location","My business partner likes this hotel very much, to the tune of staying about 100 nights per year.    He likes the location of the hotel, smack in the middle of the nicest residential area of London, relatively quiet, but with easy access to close by luxury retail, good restaurants, etc.    It is the old Sheraton that was bought out by Thompson Hotels, and redesigned to be hip, now attracting a bunch of hipsters hanging around the second floor bar in the late evening.    Hipsters reject the culturally-ignorant attitudes of mainstream consumers, and are often be seen wearing vintage and thrift store inspired fashions, tight-fitting jeans, old-school sneakers, and sometimes thick rimmed glasses.  For me, I have had bad experiences at the hotel but I am assured by the young,‚Ä¶"
December 2012,Hotel Excellence,"This hotel sets standards that others should look to follow! Israel, our doorman was just wonderful from the moment we arrived and greeted us by name each time we returned. All other. Front office staff always had a friendly and genuine smile for us as we walked by and couldn't have been more helpful. The decor on he lobby, bar, corridors and rooms is warm and inviting, and the rooms are both superbly appointed and very comfortable. Food and service in the restaurant was also outstanding though the decor was not as inviting as the rest of the hotel. Frankly that didn't matter as the food and service more than made up for it. This hotel is the best I have ever stayed in and I can't recommend it highly enough!"
December 2012,Better than home away from home,"We would come back to the hotel after going out and be greeted by the doorman who remembers your name.  This hotel is taking the concept of service to a new level.  Every aspect was spot on.  The rooms are new, modern and tastefully decorated. How good is this hotel?  I was sad to leave because all the people working at the hotel treated us like friends not clients."
January 2013,"Great experience, most helpful front desk and concierge","Awesome experience the moment we got out of the taxi to the moment we got our bags to leave London. Very helpful, pleasant doorman.  We added a member to our party mid trip and changed rooms; they couldn' have been more accomodating or helpful in the move.  The room was clean, mattresses firm, plenty of pillows, good temp control.  The room had a nice little sitting area, large windows overlooking a little park.  WIFI was pretty good, easy to plug in US power cord.   Sabin at concierge desk was super proficient giving advice, making dinner reservations.  And another member of the front desk saw us on the Eurostar to Paris and spent 30 minutes to provide a detailed itinenary of must see/eat places in Paris.  She couldn't have been sweeter and her recommendations were spot on. ‚Ä¶"
December 2012,Defining Hospitality!!,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Belgraves, a Thompson Hotel and I wanted to share what a wonderful experience it was.  Everyone there, from the front desk staff to the concierge, to the bartender made me feel welcome from the moment I stepped through the door.  As someone who travels extensively for work, Belgraves is now my home away from home when traveling to London.  The location as well is perfect for walking, window shopping, dining options and just enjoying the neighborhood."
September 2012,Beauty at The Belgraves,"My husband and I recently spent a perfect night at The Belgraves. We loved the location of this hip little gem - easy to walk, cab or tube to many great dining options as well sight's and shopping during the day.  We loved how the neat little location made it feel like we were living as locals in a chic London neighborhood.  We'll definitely be back on our next visit to jolly'ole London and will recommend this hotel to friends and family!!"
December 2012,"great hotel, friendly staff and good food","I recently stayed at the Belgraves and had a wonderful stay. From the moment I checked in the staff were very friendly and welcoming. It is a very modern hotel and the bar was really buzzing when we had a drink before dinner. The food in the restaurant was also excellant, just a shame the restaurant was a little quiet. I would really recommend this hotel."
April 2012,Nice Stay,Received a warm greeting and felt good energy here. Rooms were smaller than we expected.  Bed and linens good but towels a bit scratchy.  Room service was prompt but food was pretty bland and disappointing.  We would definitely stay here again but would need to upgrade to a suite to have the space to be comfortable.  Great location too!
April 2012,Bar Spectaculare,"I was at the Belgraves bar last Saturday night, and it appears it is the new place to be seen in London. Spectacular drinks, perfection of service (If you see the bar manager, a German guy who I think was called Marcus make sure you deal with him, he was vamazi) and a fantastic atmosphere with all the beautiful people.  I cant recommend the place enough, check it out."
August 2012,great hotel,Spent a weekend in Begravres during January 2013. Hotel is new and well designed. the lobby the Bar in the first floor are very trendy. we booked a standard room which proved to be a little small. would go for the larger rooms next time.
November 2012,Very good hotel with a comfortable feeling,"Belgraves Hotel is a very comfortable hotel with good room sizes and great staff.  Brand new comfortable and homey rooms, One of the most comfortable beds I have slept in hotels. Location is 5 minutes away from Sloane square, Harrods or Kings road. Highly recomended."
October 2012,A surprise location in LONDON!,"I had the pleasure of visiting the Belgraves Hotel in Knightsbridge, London just before Christmas. The staff were extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the property and the area! The sales manager showed me various rooms at this prestigious location - which were all BEAUTIFULLY re-done. Not updated - but completely re-done to a 5 star standard! The Thompson Suite (at the corner of the building) has marvelous views even from the BATHROOM - believe, which is where I shall opt out to stay on my next (frequent) trip over to LONDON! The Belgraves is virtually a 5 minute walk to Sloan Street (compares to: Wilshire Blvd. - L.A.) and Knightsbridge High Street. Its a 10 minute walk to the prestigious Harrods and Harvey Nichols department stores. I understand that the restaurant will‚Ä¶"
October 2012,A great hotel!,Everytime i visit London i stay at the Belgraves Everything is perfect! The staff working makes you feel home they are great! The room are very nice& clean! The bar is trendy The location cannot be better Can't wait to go back Marc D.
October 2012,Great Design and Staff,"At first we were a bit apprehensive on account of some of the early reviews, but any concern turned out to be unfounded. We were given a brilliant corner suite which was thoroughly modern yet familiar and welcoming with lots of touches that gave the room a lot of warmth, especially the hardwood floors and a love seat and desk in two alcoves, separated by see-through curtains. The layout is inspired and truly practical and for London, the room is large. There were two massive built-in closets with enough room to accommodate a stay of several months. The staff were incredibly friendly, cheerful and knowledgeable. The one thing we noted was the hotel did not provide any free drinking water, but when we mentioned this on check-out, the water we had used from the mini bar was not‚Ä¶"
October 2012,the best lounge bar!,"wish to thank personally the director of F&B - ryan -   for a wonderful evening and congratulate him for an impeccable service and quality. This was one of the most exhilarating tasting experiences I have even had. Pavel (our mixologist for the evening) and Marcus really spoiled us and made our evening memorable.  The belgarves will definitely become my stop by place now to meet colleagues, friends and have my business meetings.  Thanks you again, we are most grateful for the hospitality your showed us and the absolute delicious drinks and snacks.  a place worth visiting!"
October 2012,A very lovely hotel,"We recently stayed at this hotel for two nights and it was a lovely experience.  The room was spacious for London and the finishing was beautiful, especially the floors and the shower, a delight.  The staff were so welcoming, enthusiastic about the product and keen to assist.  They were also very helpful and concerned when my husband became ill on our last day.  As someone else mentioned the location, while very central, is in a more residential area, so it is a bit of a walk to restaurants and the tube station.  I also wish there was complimentary water in the rooms.  This just feels a little mean, when everything else about the hotel is so generous.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and hope to stay there again on our next trip to London."
October 2012,"Great location, service and food","This hotel was great, we spent there 5 days with my family and the service was excellent. The hotel has great location, walking distance to Big Ben and other tourists' attractions. It is pricy but everything in London is pricey. The food in the restaurant was delicious, the breakfast is not included so you have to pay but again the food was very good so it is worth the price. Just do get continental breakfast, it is much better to order something from the menu.  There is nothing bad I can say about this place, everybody was very helpful and friendly to the point that when I had a migraine at 3 am and went down to front dest asking for some pain killers I was told they are not allowed to have any drugs at the hotel, but they can go to a pharmacy and buy some for me. I was so much‚Ä¶"
October 2012,Wonderful hotel,"I stayed for one night on a business trip and must say the hotel was lovely. The hotel was clean with a large sized room. I was upgraded free of charge by the front desk so I guess the room was a bit bigger than the double I originally paid for. There were no wall to wall carpets in the room which is common for UK (and for me is a big ""yuk"" factor). Instead there were lovely wooden floors. Gorgeous bathroom with bath and shower. The hotel uses REN products which adds a nice touch. I would definitely return to this hotel for business purposes but also on a familiy trip as the location is great for vacation. 5 min walk to Sloane Square and King Street. A great addition to London's hotel selection!"
February 2012,Truely amazing,"I stayed in this hotel recently while on a business trip and the hotel was truely amazing. If you want a great hotel, thats excellently designed and is a true experience to stay in then i genuinely recommend this hotel.   Keep in mind that London is an old city and the hotel sometimes feel like old generation hotels, but this hotel is cutting edge.  The beds are comfortable and the rooms beautiful. This is London so the rooms are small, but not smaller than the suual London rooms.   Hotel staff are amazing and very well trained.   The food is great, I recommend you have the scrammbled duck eggs for breakfast.   Location is the only problem, its not very close to any tube station, but still the nearest one is walking distance away. Knightsbridge tube station is about a 10 minute‚Ä¶"
February 2012,Good deal,Stayed for 3 days while attending the London Book Fair. Very nice newly opened hotel so all the interior is very modern. The rooms are not very big but very well laid out and look great. The beds and mattresses are very comfortable. Bar and lounge area look great and the outdoor smoking area is very well designed which is very unusual. Breakfast was good. The location for my purpose was not good but overall it¬¥s fine. Bought the stay on www.jetsetter.com and it was a great deal for a 4/5 star hotel. Would not buy at the regular rate but for what I paid it was great.
June 2012,"Service, Service, and More Service!!!!","We stayed at the Belgraves Hotel for 8 days and 7 nights for the Olympics. It is located in the heart of Knightsbridge, one of the most exclusive areas in London. We had reserved a car to pick us up but they were late and could not find us.  So we took a cab which turned out to be the cab ride from hell from Heathrow. To say the least, my husband and I were not in a great mood to begin our hotel stay given a long flight from the U.S. coupled with the cab incident.  We arrived about 10 am at the hotel and were greeted by two very nice young doormen. They took our luggage from the cab and open the door to the hotel for us.  This was the beginning of a very wonderful stay.   From the time we set foot in the hotel until the day we left, we were treated like royalty. The concierge‚Ä¶"
May 2012,You will enjoy your stay,Best concierge service you will get in a hotel.  Great location. Quiet.  Rooms are not the biggest but they have the Best beds. Friendly staff.  You feel home. Once you stay here you will want to come back.
May 2012,Great hotel!,"The hotel offered excellent service and a very pleasent stay, defientely a hotel to try if you havn't and I will be returning shortly. The staff were excellent and really tried to make sure your needs were catered for. Great US serrvice in the heart of London!"
May 2012,a memorable stay at the Belgraves,"This is by far the best hotel we have stayed in in London! Welcoming and helpful staff from arrival to departure, well appointed rooms with excellent facilities (the shower is to die for!) and the most comfortable bed ever.... It is in a side street which means a quiet and peaceful night ahead... What else can I say except go and see for yourself, you will not be disappointed! And another thing..it was a special occasion for me and my partner and we were upgraded to a studio suite! It has never happened to us before in London!"
April 2012,Shelter from the Storm,Great Hotel. Staying here a few nights as our layover turned into an open ended stay thanks to Hurricane Sandy! But not to fret. We made the right call by booking a suite at Belgraves and are really enjoying the place. The staff is attentive and neat. The rooms are well appointed. The shower is AWESOME! Only complaint is the daily Internet access fee....no worries we have 3G.
May 2012,A jewel of a hotel,"This hotel has much to commend it, including great location, design and friendly employees, particularly the very eager, welcoming bell staff. It's not inexpensive -- and the approximately $22 daily charge for internet service was ridiculous -- but the overall value is pretty good. Plus, the showers are phenomenal, with awesome water pressure, stable temperatures and intuitive controls."
April 2012,Amazing Luxury Stay at The Belgraves,"I have never written a review on TripAdvisor, but my stay at Belgraves, forced me to have to write one. I had the most amazing stay at the Thompson Hotel. Unbelievably great service from check in to check out. From Julian at the door who personally addressed me every time I entered and exited the hotel, to the other staff at the door, to the front desk staff, to the concierge, I literally couldn't have asked for any better service. I communicated a proposal would be happening during my trip, and they made us feel so comfortable and took care of us more than I could have ever imagined. We were sent a complimentary bottle of champagne on the first night, and the room they placed us in was amazing. We purchased a King Premium room, and it was great. It featured a nice foyer area,‚Ä¶"
April 2012,Just perfect,"Attentive staff, well designed rooms, the room was 'pin drop quiet' and the bed was a bed 'to die for'.  Belgraves really does define a boutique hotel.  Combined with its quiet residential setting in one if the most beautiful sections of London's Belgravia, this hotel is great!"
April 2012,Cool ambiance and strong service; a couple small details missing for five stars,"I booked Belgraves via Tablet, and got a cheaper rate than the Thompson Hotels website, just as an FYI for other travelers. The hotel is very chic, with strong service. From the bell staff who met me at the cab to the front desk staff, everyone was very helpful (almost too much so - I only had a small bag and they insisted on bringing it up to my room for me). The rooms are well appointed, but as other reviewers have said, not all that large - although in line with other London accommodations. The bed was comfortable and linens fresh. Although small, I appreciated that the a la carte breakfast prices were not astronomical, and that there was actually a wide selection of a la carte items, even for the room service breakfast - you didn't have to buy a $20 meal. The two nits I had‚Ä¶"
March 2012,"Lovely Stay at The Belgraves, A Thompson Hotel","A lovely boutique hotel in the Belgravia area, London. I arrived on the opening day of the hotel opening on 1st Feb at 10am, We Received a very warm welcome by Nikkolas and the front desk staff, i booked a King Premium room which i did like when i walked inside.I was only there for a short 2 night stay with my wife and so gladly happy i chose the Belgraves, Room was very nice and cosy but small but i was satisfied, i chose the walk in shower bathroom as requested and my request was granted. Only thing was the bathroom was very small but then again you don't expect them to break it up and rebuild for you. Overall how the bathroom looked i was a satisfied guest. The Decor was very nice, The marble bathroom was nice along with the amenities. most of the time i used the room service‚Ä¶"
December 2023,New and well worth trying,"I was really impressed by this hotel. Everything smells new and the staff are just settling in, but it's a total WOW. Outstanding design, wonderful use of glass in all areas, and rooms that deliver everything you need when on business in London. Not cheap, but I am thinking of treating my wiife to a weekend there. It's special."
October 2021,The Staff Make Belgraves,"I have just returned from a 3 night stay at Belgraves and cannot praise the staff highly enough.    For me the stars of the show were a lovely, blonde Polish waitress who served me lunch on one day and dinner on my last evening, she was attentive and a total professional. So she may recognise herself in this review I want to say that I told her about a wedding I am due to attend in Poland in June and she told me all about the amazing restaurant in Shoreditch which is part of the same chain.  The other stars were the eternally cheerful and attentive doormen who really did make you feel welcome after a day of London pavement pounding and the delightful female concierge who saved  my life by checking me into my flight the night before I left and printing out my boarding pass.   ‚Ä¶"
November 2023,Loved The Belgraves,"We were only there for one night, but wished it could have been longer.  I had booked the hotel quite some time ago through the website and had a prepaid rate for a deluxe king room. We were surprised when we checked in they had upgraded us to one of their corner suites. The staff and Nicolas, in particular, couldn't have been more accommodating. They got us into a restaurant that was impossible to get into and made our arrangements for our transportation to the airport in the morning, without hesitation.  The room, we thought, was beautiful. Yes, the lighting is a bit tricky and could be brighter, but all in all, we loved the room.  The marble bathroom was gorgeous and very light with all the windows and loved the shower. The location of the hotel is superb.  A short stroll to‚Ä¶"
November 2023,"Very nice staff, tiny and unpractical room","The hotel is newly opened so the reception, restaurant and rooms are fresh and modern. Nice design and colours.  I had a room with a double bed but would not call it a double room. I'm happy that I was travelling alone as it would not have been space for two people. It was hardly enough space to open the suitcase. The room had a big wardrobe which was a waste of space as the wardrobe doors hit the bed and could not be opened properly.  The room was very badly lit. I ended up removing the lampshade so I could read in the bed. I normally don't have any problems with my sight.  There was no kettle in the room so tea/coffee had to be ordered from room service. I tried it one day and it was delivered quickly.  Nice and well functioning bathroom.  There is no breakfast buffet in the‚Ä¶"
November 2023,Fantastic New Hotel,"We booked this hotel for a night's stay for our honeymoon through Hotwire and were blown away by the service we received. The staff in the hotel went out of their way to make sure that we had a great stay and upgraded us free of charge as we were on our honeymoon.  We stayed in a deluxe double room which was trendy, clean and comfortable and just what we were looking for.  The food in the Hix restaurant was top notch and they even gave us a free cocktail for being newlyweds.  Can't fault this hotel for a couple of any age but equally we wouldn't hesitate to take our young daughter there either."
November 2023,"Nice overall, but...","... this hotel has the potential to be much better value for the money. As it is, Belgraves is in one of our favourite parts of London, a beautiful quiet area close to so much that we like, Sloane Square, Saatchi Gallery etc. So Belgraves is a winner in terms of location. It's also a winner in several other areas: the staff are great, and the concierges, one French, one Italian, are superb: they're cheerful, knowledgeable, and go the extra mile to help, in almost any language it seems. The doormen are ubiquitous and attentive, the front desk staff are very helpful.  The hotel has been recently renovated, and it's now a high design boutique hotel that features some decent contemporary art and high end finishings: it's stylish and attractive. The bar on the mezzanine is a great‚Ä¶"
November 2023,"try this new hotel: fabulous location, lucky find","Belgraves' unbeatable location -- with its posh shops and expensive luxury hotels -- makes this hotel's reasonable prices and stylish modern decor a truly lucky find. The hotel, with its 85 rooms, feels like a private (but unstuffy) club, and the neighborhood was a joy to walk around at night -- a leafy, peaceful and still part of central London.   The entrance is flanked by tall walls of lush ferns and greenery and then cantilevered steps to the second floor cocktail lounge, with cozy seating arrangements in a cool luxe setting with inoffensive contemporary art, jewel toned colors and textures. (The only offensive part was the slightly juvenile/uninteresting music.) There is a cozy outdoor terrace in the back. Didn't eat at the gold-toned restaurant but the chef, Mark Hix, has‚Ä¶"
November 2023,What could be a fabulous hotel ruined by the fact that the lighting in the room is totally inadequate,"The Belgraves has all the makings of an excellent hotel. Good staff, very well designed rooms and well thought out facilities and ammenities. However, what they were thinking when they designed the lighting in the rooms, is quite beyond understanding. The ambient light, even with all the lamps turned on, makes it impossible to see what you are doing. One also cannot leave the curtains and blinds open in an attempt to make the room brighter with natural light since the room we were assigned was overlooked by at least 5 other rooms. Unfortunately would not stay there again for this reason and urge the management to at least change the upgrade the wattage in the lamps in order to throw more light on the situation."
November 2023,New hotel in a very good location,"Very good location in the best part of London in Belgravia. Very nice area to walk around and very close to high end shopping (designer stores, Harvey Nichols and Harrods).  The hotel is still very new and both the staff and facilities need to ramp up. There was a problem with air conditioning but it was solved with a temporary solution. Service in the restaurant was pretty slow and waiters seemed to be inexperienced.   But the staff was very friendly in general and they made our stay very enjoyable! We were travelling with 2 young kids and we were also very happy to be upgraded to very comfortable connecting corner rooms."
November 2023,nice hotel,we stayed at the belgraves for one night and found the hotel style quirky yet contemporary in design the staff were great and couldnt do enough ...the only thing that needs to be taken into consideration if staying here is the shower ...if you are friends or family i could imagine there would be an embarrassing situation when showering !! the walk in shower is literally a clear glass screen visable in the bedroom apart from that we just loved the whole vibe and decor and those small finishing touches
December 2023,A pleasant stay,"Belgraves is perfectly located for any business or leisure trip, a short walk to Knightsbrige, Sloane Square, South Kensington or Hyde Park.  The service is very friendly and welcoming and the staff always available.  The concierge is particularly helpful for any last-minute request.  The hotel is nicely furnished, lively at night and the restaurant worth trying.  The only drwback is the small size of the rooms which can become quite boxy if staying for many nights."
October 2021,Fantastic hotel in great location!,"The Hari is a fantastic by hotel in a great location. Top notch service from everyone, great restaurant and room service, very clean and updated rooms. Location is perfect if you want to walk to Mayfair, Marylebone Hyde park and Sloan street shops. Would absolutely recommend!"
November 2023,The Hari is an undeniable Gem in Belgravia,"From the minute you step into this gorgeous boutique hotel, you feel very much at home. A cozy and modern hotel located in a beautiful neighbourhood, 10 minutes walk to Hyde Park, Harrods and KnightsBridge shopping district. The bed is extremely comfortable and the rooms are super clean. The staff are so lovely and welcoming especially Claudio at the front desk who made us feel right at home.  I have become a regular , and cant think of anywhere else better to stay at in London."
November 2023,Perfect London stay,"Second time staying here, it was just as amazing as the first time. Everyone working at the hotel is incredibly friendly and all are very attentive. The rooms are cozy and modern. And the hotel is located in a relatively convenient location despite London being generally difficult to get around when compared to NYC. HIGHLY recommend staying here if going to London on vacation or business!"
November 2023,A great first London visit,"The Hari, amenities and staff, was great. You couldn't ask for a better location, easy walking to plenty of shops, sights and restaurants as well as tube stations.  Our room was super comfortable with a very welcoming bed at the end of the day.  Don't neglect breakfast. Believe it or not the porridge is a thing as are the pancakes.  Thanks Hari!"
November 2023,Highly recommend this hotel,"I stay at the Hari quite regularly simply because I continue to have great experiences there. It's an excellent boutique hotel! Belgrave Place is a relatively quiet square but it's ideally located. The hotel is relaxing and the staff (many of whom have worked there for a number of years) are very friendly. They are also attentive and professional. Although not overly large (London, like many capital city hotel rooms typically aren't), the rooms are of high quality with stylish modern decoration. The beds are exceptionally comfortable and I always get a good nights sleep."
November 2023,Wonderful hotel!,"This was our first visit to The Hari. It won't be the last. The service was amazing... from the Front Desk to Guest Services to the door men. Everyone was so friendly.  I mentioned that it was my wife's birthday and they prepared the most fantastic balloons, cake and flowers - along with some lovely notes. It was such an unexpected - but wonderful surprise. Nobody could do enough. It really is a fantastic hotel. Highly recommend."
November 2023,Amazing service at the lounge and I would thank Angelica and Sergiu for their hospitality,"Their service is absolutely top-notch! The staff is friendly, attentive, and goes above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience and would especially thank Angelica and Sergiu. Whether you're enjoying a cup of coffee or indulging in their delicious menu, you can expect nothing but exceptional service. I highly recommend checking out The Hari Lounge for a memorable and enjoyable time! üåüüëå"

November 2023,The hari visit.,"Very beautiful bar. Great place for a gathering, amazing, quick service. Would definitely visit again.  The staff were very helpful. And the lounge was very nice. The atmosphere in general was just excellent.   The food and coffee were delectable."
December 2023,Great Hotel to Saty,I have stayed recently at The Hari and it was my first time vesting London. The staff are very friendly and CLARA‚Äã LEFRANC Guest Relations Manager is an amazing person who shared special wishes with me and celebrated by birthday.  
October 2021,Fantastic hotel in great location!,"The Hari is a fantastic by hotel in a great location. Top notch service from everyone, great restaurant and room service, very clean and updated rooms. Location is perfect if you want to walk to Mayfair, Marylebone Hyde park and Sloan street shops. Would absolutely recommend!"
November 2023,The Hari is an undeniable Gem in Belgravia,"From the minute you step into this gorgeous boutique hotel, you feel very much at home. A cozy and modern hotel located in a beautiful neighbourhood, 10 minutes walk to Hyde Park, Harrods and KnightsBridge shopping district. The bed is extremely comfortable and the rooms are super clean. The staff are so lovely and welcoming especially Claudio at the front desk who made us feel right at home.  I have become a regular , and cant think of anywhere else better to stay at in London."
November 2023,Perfect London stay,"Second time staying here, it was just as amazing as the first time. Everyone working at the hotel is incredibly friendly and all are very attentive. The rooms are cozy and modern. And the hotel is located in a relatively convenient location despite London being generally difficult to get around when compared to NYC. HIGHLY recommend staying here if going to London on vacation or business!"
November 2023,A great first London visit,"The Hari, amenities and staff, was great. You couldn't ask for a better location, easy walking to plenty of shops, sights and restaurants as well as tube stations.  Our room was super comfortable with a very welcoming bed at the end of the day.  Don't neglect breakfast. Believe it or not the porridge is a thing as are the pancakes.  Thanks Hari!"
November 2023,Highly recommend this hotel,"I stay at the Hari quite regularly simply because I continue to have great experiences there. It's an excellent boutique hotel! Belgrave Place is a relatively quiet square but it's ideally located. The hotel is relaxing and the staff (many of whom have worked there for a number of years) are very friendly. They are also attentive and professional. Although not overly large (London, like many capital city hotel rooms typically aren't), the rooms are of high quality with stylish modern decoration. The beds are exceptionally comfortable and I always get a good nights sleep."
November 2023,Wonderful hotel!,"This was our first visit to The Hari. It won't be the last. The service was amazing... from the Front Desk to Guest Services to the door men. Everyone was so friendly.  I mentioned that it was my wife's birthday and they prepared the most fantastic balloons, cake and flowers - along with some lovely notes. It was such an unexpected - but wonderful surprise. Nobody could do enough. It really is a fantastic hotel. Highly recommend."
November 2023,Amazing service at the lounge and I would thank Angelica and Sergiu for their hospitality,"Their service is absolutely top-notch! The staff is friendly, attentive, and goes above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience and would especially thank Angelica and Sergiu. Whether you're enjoying a cup of coffee or indulging in their delicious menu, you can expect nothing but exceptional service.

Belgrave Place is a relatively quiet square but it's ideally located. The hotel is relaxing and the staff (many of whom have worked there for a number of years) are very friendly. They are also attentive and professional. Although not overly large (London, like many capital city hotel rooms typically aren't), the rooms are of high quality with stylish modern decoration. The beds are exceptionally comfortable and I always get a good nights sleep."
November 2023,Wonderful hotel!,"This was our first visit to The Hari. It won't be the last. The service was amazing... from the Front Desk to Guest Services to the door men. Everyone was so friendly.  I mentioned that it was my wife's birthday and they prepared the most fantastic balloons, cake and flowers - along with some lovely notes. It was such an unexpected - but wonderful surprise. Nobody could do enough. It really is a fantastic hotel. Highly recommend."
November 2023,Amazing service at the lounge and I would thank Angelica and Sergiu for their hospitality,"Their service is absolutely top-notch! The staff is friendly, attentive, and goes above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience and would especially thank Angelica and Sergiu. Whether you're enjoying a cup of coffee or indulging in their delicious menu, you can expect nothing but exceptional service. I highly recommend checking out The Hari Lounge for a memorable and enjoyable time! üåüüëå"

Would absolutely recommend!"
November 2023,The Hari is an undeniable Gem in Belgravia,"From the minute you step into this gorgeous boutique hotel, you feel very much at home. A cozy and modern hotel located in a beautiful neighbourhood, 10 minutes walk to Hyde Park, Harrods and KnightsBridge shopping district. The bed is extremely comfortable and the rooms are super clean. The staff are so lovely and welcoming especially Claudio at the front desk who made us feel right at home.  I have become a regular , and cant think of anywhere else better to stay at in London."
November 2023,Perfect London stay,"Second time staying here, it was just as amazing as the first time. Everyone working at the hotel is incredibly friendly and all are very attentive. The rooms are cozy and modern. And the hotel is located in a relatively convenient location despite London being generally difficult to get around when compared to NYC. HIGHLY recommend staying here if going to London on vacation or business!"
November 2023,A great first London visit,"The Hari, amenities and staff, was great. You couldn't ask for a better location, easy walking to plenty of shops, sights and restaurants as well as tube stations.  Our room was super comfortable with a very welcoming bed at the end of the day.  Don't neglect breakfast. Believe it or not the porridge is a thing as are the pancakes.  Thanks Hari!"
November 2023,Highly recommend this hotel,"I stay at the Hari quite regularly simply because I continue to have great experiences there. It's an excellent boutique hotel! Belgrave Place is a relatively quiet square but it's ideally located. The hotel is relaxing and the staff (many of whom have worked there for a number of years) are very friendly. They are also attentive and professional. Although not overly large (London, like many capital city hotel rooms typically aren't), the rooms are of high quality with stylish modern decoration. The beds are exceptionally comfortable and I always get a good nights sleep."
November 2023,Wonderful hotel!,"This was our first visit to The Hari. It won't be the last. The service was amazing... from the Front Desk to Guest Services to the door men. Everyone was so friendly.  I mentioned that it was my wife's birthday and they prepared the most fantastic balloons, cake and flowers - along with some lovely notes. It was such an unexpected - but wonderful surprise. Nobody could do enough. It really is a fantastic hotel. Highly recommend."
November 2023,Amazing service at the lounge and I would thank Angelica and Sergiu for their hospitality,"Their service is absolutely top-notch! The staff is friendly, attentive, and goes above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience and would especially thank Angelica and Sergiu. Whether you're enjoying a cup of coffee or indulging in their delicious menu, you can expect nothing but exceptional service. I highly recommend checking out The Hari Lounge for a memorable and enjoyable time! üåüüëå"

December 2023,Great Hotel to Saty,I have stayed recently at The Hari and it was my first time vesting London. The staff are very friendly and CLARA‚Äã LEFRANC Guest Relations Manager is an amazing person who shared special wishes with me and celebrated by birthday.  
October 2021,Fantastic hotel in great location!,"The Hari is a fantastic by hotel in a great location. Top notch service from everyone, great restaurant and room service, very clean and updated rooms. Location is perfect if you want to walk to Mayfair, Marylebone Hyde park and Sloan street shops. Would absolutely recommend!"
November 2023,The Hari is an undeniable Gem in Belgravia,"From the minute you step into this gorgeous boutique hotel, you feel very much at home. A cozy and modern hotel located in a beautiful neighbourhood, 10 minutes walk to Hyde Park, Harrods and KnightsBridge shopping district. The bed is extremely comfortable and the rooms are super clean. The staff are so lovely and welcoming especially Claudio at the front desk who made us feel right at home.  I have become a regular , and cant think of anywhere else better to stay at in London."
November 2023,Perfect London stay,"Second time staying here, it was just as amazing as the first time. Everyone working at the hotel is incredibly friendly and all are very attentive. The rooms are cozy and modern. And the hotel is located in a relatively convenient location despite London being generally difficult to get around when compared to NYC. HIGHLY recommend staying here if going to London on vacation or business!"
November 2023,A great first London visit,"The Hari, amenities and staff, was great. You couldn't ask for a better location, easy walking to plenty of shops, sights and restaurants as well as tube stations.  Our room was super comfortable with a very welcoming bed at the end of the day.  Don't neglect breakfast. Believe it or not the porridge is a thing as are the pancakes.  Thanks Hari!"
November 2023,Highly recommend this hotel,"I stay at the Hari quite regularly simply because I continue to have great experiences there. It's an excellent boutique hotel! Belgrave Place is a relatively quiet square but it's ideally located. The hotel is relaxing and the staff (many of whom have worked there for a number of years) are very friendly. They are also attentive and professional. Although not overly large (London, like many capital city hotel rooms typically aren't), the rooms are of high quality with stylish modern decoration. The beds are exceptionally comfortable and I always get a good nights sleep."
November 2023,Wonderful hotel!,"This was our first visit to The Hari. It won't be the last. The service was amazing... from the Front Desk to Guest Services to the door men. Everyone was so friendly.  I mentioned that it was my wife's birthday and they prepared the most fantastic balloons, cake and flowers - along with some lovely notes. It was such an unexpected - but wonderful surprise. Nobody could do enough. It really is a fantastic hotel. Highly recommend."

You couldn't ask for a better location, easy walking to plenty of shops, sights and restaurants as well as tube stations.  Our room was super comfortable with a very welcoming bed at the end of the day.  Don't neglect breakfast. Believe it or not the porridge is a thing as are the pancakes.  Thanks Hari!"
November 2023,Highly recommend this hotel,"I stay at the Hari quite regularly simply because I continue to have great experiences there. It's an excellent boutique hotel! Belgrave Place is a relatively quiet square but it's ideally located. The hotel is relaxing and the staff (many of whom have worked there for a number of years) are very friendly. They are also attentive and professional. Although not overly large (London, like many capital city hotel rooms typically aren't), the rooms are of high quality with stylish modern decoration. The beds are exceptionally comfortable and I always get a good nights sleep."
November 2023,Wonderful hotel!,"This was our first visit to The Hari. It won't be the last. The service was amazing... from the Front Desk to Guest Services to the door men. Everyone was so friendly.  I mentioned that it was my wife's birthday and they prepared the most fantastic balloons, cake and flowers - along with some lovely notes. It was such an unexpected - but wonderful surprise. Nobody could do enough. It really is a fantastic hotel. Highly recommend."
November 2023,Amazing service at the lounge and I would thank Angelica and Sergiu for their hospitality,"Their service is absolutely top-notch! The staff is friendly, attentive, and goes above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience and would especially thank Angelica and Sergiu. Whether you're enjoying a cup of coffee or indulging in their delicious menu, you can expect nothing but exceptional service. I highly recommend checking out The Hari Lounge for a memorable and enjoyable time! üåüüëå"

October 2021,Fantastic hotel in great location!,"The Hari is a fantastic by hotel in a great location. Top notch service from everyone, great restaurant and room service, very clean and updated rooms. Location is perfect if you want to walk to Mayfair, Marylebone Hyde park and Sloan street shops. Would absolutely recommend!"
November 2023,The Hari is an undeniable Gem in Belgravia,"From the minute you step into this gorgeous boutique hotel, you feel very much at home. A cozy and modern hotel located in a beautiful neighbourhood, 10 minutes walk to Hyde Park, Harrods and KnightsBridge shopping district. The bed is extremely comfortable and the rooms are super clean. The staff are so lovely and welcoming especially Claudio at the front desk who made us feel right at home.  I have become a regular , and cant think of anywhere else better to stay at in London."
November 2023,Perfect London stay,"Second time staying here, it was just as amazing as the first time. Everyone working at the hotel is incredibly friendly and all are very attentive. The rooms are cozy and modern. And the hotel is located in a relatively convenient location despite London being generally difficult to get around when compared to NYC. HIGHLY recommend staying here if going to London on vacation or business!"
November 2023,A great first London visit,"The Hari, amenities and staff, was great. You couldn't ask for a better location, easy walking to plenty of shops, sights and restaurants as well as tube stations.  Our room was super comfortable with a very welcoming bed at the end of the day.  Don't neglect breakfast. Believe it or not the porridge is a thing as are the pancakes.  Thanks Hari!"
November 2023,Highly recommend this hotel,"I stay at the Hari quite regularly simply because I continue to have great experiences there. It's an excellent boutique hotel! Belgrave Place is a relatively quiet square but it's ideally located. The hotel is relaxing and the staff (many of whom have worked there for a number of years) are very friendly. They are also attentive and professional. Although not overly large (London, like many capital city hotel rooms typically aren't), the rooms are of high quality with stylish modern decoration. The beds are exceptionally comfortable and I always get a good nights sleep."
November 2023,Wonderful hotel!,"This was our first visit to The Hari. It won't be the last. The service was amazing... from the Front Desk to Guest Services to the door men. Everyone was so friendly.  I mentioned that it was my wife's birthday and they prepared the most fantastic balloons, cake and flowers - along with some lovely notes. It was such an unexpected - but wonderful surprise. Nobody could do enough. It really is a fantastic hotel. Highly recommend."
November 2023,Amazing service at the lounge and I would thank Angelica and Sergiu for their hospitality,"Their service is absolutely top-notch! The staff is friendly, attentive, and goes above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience and would especially thank Angelica and Sergiu. Whether you're enjoying a cup of coffee or indulging in their delicious menu, you can expect nothing but exceptional service. I highly recommend checking out The Hari Lounge for a memorable and enjoyable time! üåüüëå"

November 2023,Wonderful hotel!,"This was our first visit to The Hari. It won't be the last. The service was amazing... from the Front Desk to Guest Services to the door men. Everyone was so friendly.  I mentioned that it was my wife's birthday and they prepared the most fantastic balloons, cake and flowers - along with some lovely notes. It was such an unexpected - but wonderful surprise. Nobody could do enough. It really is a fantastic hotel. Highly recommend."

,The Hari is an undeniable Gem in Belgravia,"From the minute you step into this gorgeous boutique hotel, you feel very much at home. A cozy and modern hotel located in a beautiful neighbourhood, 10 minutes walk to Hyde Park, Harrods and KnightsBridge shopping district. The bed is extremely comfortable and the rooms are super clean. The staff are so lovely and welcoming especially Claudio at the front desk who made us feel right at home.  I have become a regular , and cant think of anywhere else better to stay at in London."
,Perfect London stay,"Second time staying here, it was just as amazing as the first time. Everyone working at the hotel is incredibly friendly and all are very attentive. The rooms are cozy and modern. And the hotel is located in a relatively convenient location despite London being generally difficult to get around when compared to NYC. HIGHLY recommend staying here if going to London on vacation or business!"
,A great first London visit,"The Hari, amenities and staff, was great. You couldn't ask for a better location, easy walking to plenty of shops, sights and restaurants as well as tube stations.  Our room was super comfortable with a very welcoming bed at the end of the day.  Don't neglect breakfast. Believe it or not the porridge is a thing as are the pancakes.  Thanks Hari!"
,Highly recommend this hotel,"I stay at the Hari quite regularly simply because I continue to have great experiences there. It's an excellent boutique hotel! Belgrave Place is a relatively quiet square but it's ideally located. The hotel is relaxing and the staff (many of whom have worked there for a number of years) are very friendly. They are also attentive and professional. Although not overly large (London, like many capital city hotel rooms typically aren't), the rooms are of high quality with stylish modern decoration. The beds are exceptionally comfortable and I always get a good nights sleep."
