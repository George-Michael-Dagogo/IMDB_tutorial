September 2023,Wonderful experience ,"I had the pleasure of spending a week at the wonderful Milestone Hotel in London. It was my first trip to London, I was by myself and the hotel couldn’t have been more welcoming! The hotel is located in a great neighborhood, the decor is stylish yet comfortable and the rooms, bathrooms and beds were all first rate. My days would start with a delicious breakfast and end with mouthwatering dinner whether it be in the restaurant or from room service. The Stables Bar is a great place for interesting handcrafted cocktails or a pot of tea, especially after walking thousands of steps all over London. The hotel is also very close to the train stations which I after some initial reluctance on my part, I found the trains pretty easy to navigate. Most importantly I have to compliment the…"
September 2023,Charming hotel with wonderful staff!,"A charming boutique-type hotel…..lovely spacious rooms and the common areas were beautiful.  The cozy little bar with a hunt/polo theme was our favorite, and we had several casual meals there.  The breakfast room/library was also beautifully appointed. The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful!  From the doorman to the bartender, they were all very accommodating and welcoming.  A wonderful experience!"
August 2023,"Our London ""home"" in a great location!","This was our fifth stay at the Milestone, which has become our London ""home"". I found the Milestone via Trip Advisor in 2016 and we love returning! The staff (many of whom we have come to know, since they stay long term) treated us like family from trip 1, day 1-attending to every need, large and small. They have helped with transport, bookings, reservations, room needs, recommendations. Whether housekeeping behind the scenes or greeting us at the desk, the door, the concierge stand, or in the wonderful and warm dining room, we can sense the care for every guest. The consistently high quality breakfast offers plenty of variety and I would recommend including it. The Kensington location is terrific-walking distance to 3 Underground lines and multiple bus lines to get anywhere in…"
August 2023,The VERY Best!,"My family has had the occasion (and great luck) to travel to London several times a year for the last decade. We tried many different lovely hotels but once we found The Milestone our decision was made. From the warm welcome to the farewell of each trip, our stays have been perfection. Many of the staff have been there since our first stay and have developed a wonderful relationship with our daughter, having watched her grow up. Of course, as you can see in the photos, every single room is unique and gorgeous.  The afternoon tea is not to be missed. Try a picnic in the park that they prepare and set up for you. Don't miss dinner at the always delicious restaurant. Relax in the spa. Treat yourself to a bespoke cocktail in the bar or conservatory.  Each time we go, we find a new…"
September 2023,Superb,"Excellent hotel staff are amazing so homely and friendly it’s so quirky they all know your name too, we will definitely be going back, nothing is too much trouble for them if you ask the cocktails in the bar are amazing. Zen who shown us round the hotel is fantastic too"
September 2023,Milestone Hotel - superb experience,"The Milestone is superb - we experienced outstanding staff from the moment we arrived - Doorman, desk staff, Concierge, bar and dining room staff and managers. Everybody was oriented to assist you and make your visit effortless.  The decor was beautiful throughout. We were favored with an extensive tour by the Night Manager and learned so much about the history and interior design features.  The English Breakfast whould not be missed."
August 2023,Unbelievably spectacular. Treated like royalty. Fabulous stay.,Simply glorious. Fantastic service. Great people. Excellent food. Superior in every way. Stunning. Exceeded all expectations. We cannot wait to go back. The people treated us like royalty. The afternoon tea — everything.
August 2023,Wedding anniversary stay,Wonderful service could not reccommend this hotel and its staff highly enough we stayed two nights over our 30th wedding anniversary the lady on the front desk Alice  and several other staff really made us feel very welcome we will definitely like to stay here again
August 2023,"Wonderful service, great location!","The Milestone is a wonderful hotel in Kensington right across the street from Hyde Park. My wife and I stayed there for a week for our anniversary. The staff bent over backward to make our stay incredible. Our flight arrived early in the morning before our room was ready (we knew this would be the case). The staff immediately helped us with a spot to get cleaned up from traveling and stored our luggage so we could start exploring the city. The hotel is an easy walk to the tube station as well as an easy walk around Hyde Park, to Notting Hill, and many other nearby stops.  Throughout the week, the hotel helped us celebrate our anniversary with a special cake, champagne, and well wishes. We ate at the hotel and did afternoon tea. The food and restaurant service was impeccable. …"
August 2023,Wonderful London Stay at the Milestone Hotel,"The Milestone is amongst the very best of the many London hotels we've stayed at. As soon as you enter the service is clearly at the very highest standards. Afternoon tea was lovely and all the staff made a real effort with us and our 8 year old daughter. The hotel feels intimate and full of character. The rooms are spotless, spacious and beautifully furnished. It's in a great location for visiting Kensington, Hyde park and the big national museums. Would certainly recommend without any hesitation. Thank you Milestone and all your team!"
July 2023,Just wonderful! ,"The Milestone Hotel has a very special place in our hearts. 13 years ago my husband proposed to me in one of the beautiful suites, and when we returned this year for our anniversary and a family wedding in London,  we were blown away when we opened the doors of our room to find it was the exact same suite. All the memories and all the emotion came flooding back and we were made to feel so special and pampered by the wonderful staff and their hospitality at this incredible hotel. Not only is the location fabulous, the beds luxurious and the rooms beautiful designed, it’s all the personal touches that make this hotel so special. It wasn’t by luck that we were staying in the same suite we were engaged in, they just knew and surprised us.  We loved the flowers and hand written note…"
September 2023,A Perfect Honeymoon Experience! ,"Very thankful to The Milestone for making our honeymoon extra special.  The accommodations, the location and the historic building itself were all outstanding and the service and the staff were truly world class.  Their attention to the little details of every aspect sets them apart from other locations I have stayed.  Highly recommended.  "
September 2023,True British Flavor and Service That Goes Above and Beyond,"So many London lodging have lost their British flavor, attention to the smallest detail and staff that emanates caring. Not The Milestone. We formerly had stayed at a variety of hotels, the best  being The Stafford and Hotel 41, which is a sister Red Carnation Hotel Collection property to The Milestone, but more boutique-y. Hotel 41 does  have a spread of edibles included in the rates and an honor bar. However, based on a strong recommendation from our travel agent, we booked The Milestone and had the best London hotel experience ever. From the uniformed doormen who learned our names and even walked down the sidewalk with us to give directions, to the helpful front desk and efficient concierge team, to veteran General Manager Andrew Pike and fabulous bartender Angelo, we were…"
August 2023,Welcome Home,"“Welcome home”, not welcome back. That is how personal the Milestone has become. What can we say. Personal experience. Great people. From the stories about fishing with Steve the doorman, to true tales about WWII with Joe the Conceirge, to conversations about Scotland with Steve the dining room mgr, everything about the Milestone is personal and fantastic "
July 2023,Vintage charm and understated luxury,"The hotel is the perfect blend of sumptuous elegance and intimacy. All the superlatives you may have read about it in other reviews are true to the last letter. It is a place that exudes exclusiveness, where all staff treat you with utmost care (I would just like to mention Leo Forte whom I met one morning at breakfast and who provided me with valuable recommendations). The vintage decoration in the room, in the restaurant and the foyer is magnificent, very atmospheric, yet not overdone. The personalized gifts I found in my room upon arrival were just another touch to the memorable stay I had in this hotel. Needless to say, the area where it is located (South Kensington) includes many tourist highlights worth exploring. "
September 2023,Incredible Stay,"It was an incredible stay for us.   I can't remember a better hotel than this so far in my life.  Our stay was from September,23rd - 30th, 2023. We felt very welcomed there. It started with our arrival at Heathrow, where we were welcomed by our driver (we used a car with driver, since my girlfriend uses a wheelchair), to the kindly Portier (both Steves), the concierge, reservation desk etc. . The whole staff helped at any possible time with manpower, knowledge or answers, especially since my girlfriend had to use a wheelchair. A great thank you to the whole staff again. Enjoy fantastic and delicous drinks and food (i can especially recommend the after noon tea ;) ). The location right to Kensington Park makes it even better (friendly people there, clean and really relaxing). We…"
September 2023,What an amazing time!,"I am just home from an incredible week in London. What made our trip even better was where we stayed. I can't say enough about it! From the bed, blankets, pillows, to the helpful wonderful way the staff greeted us. It was amazing There were even live carnations in the elevators! The Milestone Hotel has it all. You've got to experience it yourselves! "
September 2023,Dedicated and friendly staff.,The Milestone is a great hotel to stay at in London.  What made it especially pleasant was the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff.  from the concierge to the housekeeping staff everyone made sure our needs were met. 
September 2023,Best hotel!! Our stay was just wonderful!!!,"I loved this hotel!! My friend and I spent 3 nights in this beautiful hotel!  Perfect location, right across from Hyde Park.  From the moment we checked in, everyone was so nice and friendly!  Our room was beautiful with wonderful candies and/or cookies, so good!!! First night we ate fish and chips and yummy cocktails in the hotel bar…delicious!! We also had dinner in the restaurant Cheneston..fabulous!! Then we had the most beautiful Afternoon Tea, champagne and highly decorated desserts, sandwiches and scones! It was sooo good and our server was so attentive and just the best! When I’m in London, I will always stay at Milestone!"
September 2023,Faultless stay for our visit to the AA Hospitality awards,"As hoteliers, this hotel deserved all of it's accolades, now our favorite place to stay! A genuine welcome from the door to the housekeeping team.  Spotlessly clean, attentive but relaxed, friendly and professional.  The best breakfast, quality ingredients, beautifully presented, delicious!  Wish you had  stayed longer, but we will be back and 100% recommendation for the Milestone Hotel - The Best of the Best! "
October 2022,Exceeded my expectation!,"My room was upgraded - I had an amazing view to the Kensington Gardens. I was welcomed with a glass of champagne, provided with a bath salt, and sent a box of house made biscuits (best ever biscuits in my life). The service was beyond great! THe personnel is exceptional!"
October 2022,Great Service & Attention to Detail,We had an awesome stay at The Milestone. I've worked in hospitality all my life and the staff there was fantastic. I wish I could remember everyone's name but Zen at the Front Desk and Grant in the Restaurant were awesome; above and beyond. The Housekeeping crew were great too. Truly a 5 star experience!!
October 2022,A night to remember!!,"We stayed at The Milestone and from the start the service was fantastic, car porters ready and waiting for us, staff to take out luggage, all well dressed and extremely polite.   This was also the night we got engaged outside the Royal Albert. I spoke with staff a few days before and mentioned I planned on proposing, without hesitation they put a plan into place and while we were out that evening they covered the room with rose petals and chocolates, also champagne!   I couldn’t recommend the hotel anymore highly, everything was brilliant and without fault, we are even looking to book our next stay. "
October 2022,An exceptional hotel in a perfect location.,"The Milestone is truly outstanding in every respect.  The rooms are spacious, comfortable and well-maintained.  The atmosphere is warm, welcoming and highly  responsive to the needs of each guest.  All of the staff are polite, friendly and professional.  We travel frequently but the Milestone is our all-time favorite place to stay."
October 2022,Wonderful hotel and staff!,"My husband and I had the best time staying at the Milestone! We were so warmly welcomed and treated like royalty. The staff helped us in any way they could and the service was fantastic! The hotel was warm, comfortable and beautiful! Just what we were looking for!"
October 2022,Impeccable,"This is a true gem of a boutique hotel. You will not find friendlier or more attentive staff in London. The rooms are lovely and the location is perfect for parks, palaces and the best museums. I have stayed in many London hotels and this one feels like staying with (very well appointed) friends. I can't recommend highly enough."
October 2022,Great Boutique Hotel,The service was impeccable. The staff was excellent. The hotel’s attention to detail made the stay enjoyable.  The daily breakfast was included. The bartender made tasty drinks.  The whole feel of The Milestone was warm and cozy.  I would highly recommend this hotel. It was wonderful!
June 2022,Once in life time trip,"We travelled from Australia to the UK - London. First time ever in London after over 60 trips around the Sun, so we wanted an experience, to stay somewhere special and in a great location - The Milestone Hotel ticked those all the boxes and more. Located just minutes from Kensington Palace (SW corner of Kensington Gardens) Close to underground, bus stop almost at door step. And of course Royal Albert Hall just down the road.  Living in such a modern World - staying at the Milestone Hotel was like almost taking a step back in time. The day core was right out of the 1910' or 20's (I think). The service was also straight out from that time.  We felt like we were living as part of Downton Abbey. All the staff from the doormen, to the General Manager (Andrew); the service desk to the…"
October 2022,A true gem,"I loved my experience with Milestone hotel, from the moment I checked in. The staff was friendly and welcoming.  Enjoyed a welcoming drink prior to arrival, got upgraded to a spacious suite with great amenities.  Great dinner experience with cozy Cheneston's as well, where food was delicious and well presented. Enjoyed a drink in the intimate Stables bar during my stay. I would definitely recommend trying their old fashioned! Breakfast at the Park lounge was great, with their cozy and warm sofas and chairs, overlooking the Royal Kensington Gardens.  Very classy hotel with an old English charm, would definitely come back!"
September 2022,Milestone Hotel is a perfect home away from home,"We love this Hotel, always a great welcome and friendly service. From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave anything you want is no problem for the staff.  The evening meals are excellent. My wife is on a low salt diet, and this was achieved without any fuss, yet she still had flavour in the meals, which is not achieved at most restaurants.  Beautiful wines at reasonable prices.  The servicing of our room was excellent, and discreet.  Looking forward to our next visit."
December 2022,Excellent service,Callum in Chenestons Restaurant went over and above in looking after us when we took a 98 year old rather deaf and slightly confused old lady for lunch on 27 December.  The food was totally delicious and we were able to enjoy it all the more knowing that when she dropped her an earring he was there to crawl under the table etc.  As the restaurant was not so busy he was very happy to chat with us and charmed all of us.
November 2022,Always good,"Just a short stay this time at the Milestone. Perfect customer service and hospitality at its best.  As we are used to with any of the Red Carnation hotels. However please correct the grumpy asocial people who are guilty of noise pollution. Ridiculous how an older man watched some films on his phone with no one of the staff telling him to behave! Probably some rich guy they were afraid of correcting. It annoyed all other guest and ruined our breakfast experience. Good manors is something money can t buy. Just an exception off course because that doesn’t represent the iverall excellent experience you will get at the milestone. Coming back again soon, this time to check out Hotel 41."
November 2022,Our third stay at The Milestone Hotel,"This is, without a doubt, one of the finest hotels in London. Impeccable service, exquisite décor, and a staff that other hotels must envy. Its unique Kensington location allows you to casually walk charming side streets and mews, discovering unique local restaurants and pubs void of tourist trappings. My wife and I spent Thanksgiving week with friends who experienced their first time at The Milestone. We will be back again next year."
December 2022,A delightful surprise!,"From the moment we pulled up it was clear that the staff was outstanding.  The evening manager was exceptional and kept insisting that he buy us a welcome drink.  Each staff member  was warm and personable.  The room was lovely, cozy, well appointed and had several nice extra touches… lots of water, fruit, etc.  We stay at 5 star hotels all over the world but have not often been as “wowed” as were were at the Milestone Hotel.  We cannot wait to return!"
December 2022,Still the best ,"Second time here. Last time, six years ago, was so great that I was ready to be disappointed. I was NOT. This is really a fantastic hotel. We stayed in a suite and a double room this time and although I have stayed in places with more luxurious design and better functions in details, the staff is what really lifts this hotel to master class! They all seem to genuinely like their jobs and that transmits to a friendly, correct and personal service, from Steve the doorman wishing us welcome back home after a walk, to almost everybody knowing our name to the great breakfast staff taking care of every wish with a  smile and a nice comment. We also had quite a lot of need of help from the concierge to arrange an activity with nanny for one of my daughters which they solved 100%.   I…"
December 2022,Magical vacation,"One of the best hotel I have ever been to. Great service and everything is so clean, good food and a wonderful atmosphere. This is a unique experience for London highly recommended don’t miss the beauty and luxurious place! We’re having a wonderful vacation because of this experience"
November 2022,Fabulous Hotel,"OMG, what a great hotel!!!  It was formerly a mansion & is very warm & inviting.  We were there to check in early & room was not quite ready so had complimentary drinks in their magnificent bar.   So beautifully English traditional.  We made reservations for formal tea the first afternoon.  The room was gorgeous with a fireplace, heavy draperies, beautiful fabrics.  The service, champagne, scones etc were wonderful.  Great location across from Kensington Palace.   Close to Royal Albert Hall, Natural History, Victoria & Albert Museum.  We walked to Harrods.  Staff made reservations for us when needed.  We had a yummy dinner in our room one night & tea service twice.  Our room had a couch & two chairs & a large luxurious bathroom & again beautiful fabrics.  We stayed at the #1…"
November 2022,Comfortable and homely with a real touch of luxury,We were made to feel really welcome at every turn. The service was exceptional (as were the cocktails). The room was spacious and spotless and the bed was like sleeping on a cloud. Every staff member we came across were friendly and accommodating and went out of their way to make our staff very special. We can't wait to come back.
November 2022,"A special place to celebrate a ""milestone"" birthday","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Milestone Hotel. The staff made us feel so welcome and special. Our rooms were beautiful, comfortable and had everything we needed. A highlight for us was our full English breakfast in the charming dining room. Special thanks to the friendly doorman, who always gave us the best advice on how to get around in London. We would love a return visit someday!"
November 2022,Amazing Afternoon Tea,"I used to live just around the corner from The Milestone. The first thing you notice is how nice it looks from the outside. I went here with a friend of mine for afternoon tea and we weren't disappointed. The room where we were served was elegant yet very cosy and inviting. It has a very relaxed atmosphere and the staff were attentive and polite. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who planned to go shopping around the Kensington area and wanted to finish off with a wonderful afternoon tea and amazing surroundings. It was quiet on the day we went, and I'm wondering if it's always like that - so nice to find a quieter place to enjoy good food when you've spent the day in bustling London. Definitely recommend!"
March 2023,"Great staff, great location.","Excellent service, happy to help with any request. Great rooms with very comfortable beds including nightly 'turn-down' treats. Rooms were well sound-proofed too. Very good location on Kensington High Street.  Plan to go again soon."
March 2023,The Milestone is Simply the best if you want comfort and 5 star service in London.,"From the moment you get to the steps of the hotel you are greeted with a big smile and the hospitality gets better with every passing moment. We stayed in the Ruhlmann suite which is a corner suite with great views of Kensington Palace. The showers and bathtub were beyond inviting and the turndown service made you look forward to your time in the suite. However, i must say that it is the service that makes the Milestone stand out from all other hotels that i stayed at in London. They always go above and beyond to show that they truly care about your stay and that your visit is second to none. I have stayed at many other properties in London but am very happy to call the Milestone my home away from home and will stay no where else! Shout out to Leo and Angelo!!! simply the best…"
March 2023,Luxury & Service Compliment One Another,Staff were second to none. Room was sumptuous and we were made to feel at home. We always try to stay in a Red Carnation  Hotel when in London as  you know the level of service  will be too class. Can’t recommend Milestone highly enough. Had a fantastic stay and will definitely be back. 
February 2023,Just Fabulous,"Fabulous stay at the Milestone. Thank you to all the team. Front of house were fantastic from the door men, concierge and reception. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and we were kindly given an upgrade which was very much appreciated. Lovely welcome drink on arrival to the room as well. Thank you, will def return very soon. "
February 2023,Our go-to-place in London,"Just came back from a wonderful stay at the Milestone Hotel in London. Have to say that this was one of the best, if not the best, hotel experiences that we’ve ever had in the UK. The service truly is five star - and it is that way throughout the hotel - from the folks who greet you at the entrance to the reception and the restaurants to housekeeping - everyone makes you feel genuinely welcome and appreciated. I do not know for certain of course, but somehow it feels there is a great team spirit and vibe among the staff which gets reflected in this exceptional customer experience. The hotel itself is beautiful with a long history (used to be a stable servicing the Kensington Palace way back in time - thanks doorman Steve for that tidbit of info) and now obviously a truly…"
February 2023,Exceptional Stay at the Milestone Hotel,"We just had a truly special stay at the Milestone. First, the hotel is absolutely beautiful. Second, the service, from the doormen, to the front desk, to the concierge, to the restaurant staff - is the best, the most personal, I have had at any hotel I have ever stayed. The entirety of the staff are engaging, friendly, knowledgable and truly go out of their way to make your experience special, and are clearly empowered to do so. I can rattle off so many examples during our 5 night stay including 1) little treats that were left in our room to welcome us and each night at turndown; 2) the entire restaurant staff recognizing and proactively accommodating a dairy and peanut allergy  within our family even creating a whole separate vegan sandwich/desert plate during our afternoon…"
February 2023,A true gem in the Crown of London hotels,"Whilst being amongst the glitterati of 5 star luxury London hotels, the Milestone stands out for combining the relaxed atmosphere of a beautiful Kensington home, with fabulous bedrooms, great food and service but above all, the friendliness and professionalism that sets Red Carnation apart from the rest. A stay that always seems to exceed expectations."
October 2022,Home away from home!,This hotel is an absolute gem of Kensington!  We had a splendid dinner at the Cheneston's and the staff cannot be more friendly and professional.   The bar team made cocktails tailored to our taste and was always reachable.  Breakfast portion is generous and delicious. Would definitely recommend the omelette.
September 2022,Honeymoon in London,"My wife and I had the most exceptional stay at the Milestone!  Every detail was taken into consideration and the staff truly go out of their way to make you feel like a welcome and honored guest.  The experience is the best of both worlds--lush and luxurious, yet cozy and full of personal touches.    Situated directly across from Kensington Gardens, the location is peaceful and charming, yet just a short walk from the vibrant shopping district of High Street Kensington and access to both District and Circle underground lines.    Could not recommend more highly!"
October 2022,Great hotel,My husband and I absolutely loved our four night stay at Milestone Hotel. The staff really went above and beyond to make sure our stay was wonderful. We had delicious breakfast every morning and enjoyed dinner and afternoon tea. The front desk and concierge associates were friendly and helpful accommodating our jet lagged sleep schedule. Would recommend staying here again.
September 2022,Beautiful hotel with exceptional service,"Great customer service, facilities and bar. The rooms are very well appointed and comfortable.  Despite being in central London the noise is minimal from nearby roads. The staff go the extra mile and are very helpful. The pool, restaurant and bar are great and would definitely stay again."
August 2022,British hospitality at its best,"The Milestone hotel was my home during Notting Hill Carnival 2022. I‘m glad I found this small jewel, which is as luxurious as it is cozy. My room was very beautiful, clean and tidy. The daily cleaning was very attentive and thorough. The interior is stylish and beautiful The 24/7 room service with delicous dishes saved me sometimes when I got back hungry. Next time I hope to explore more of the culinary possibilities as they look promising, but during Carnival I was often just exhausted when returning or too late. The Spa is basic. There is a Finnish sauna and a pool with a counter-current system. It‘s definitely not a wellness hotel, but completely ok to relax a bit. Thanks to the exceptional service, they managed to organise a wonderful sports massage on a Sunday at very…"
September 2022,Extra Touches and Exemplary Service,"I have been to London many times and seen many luxury hotels but, to me, The Milestone is by far the best of them all. The building is absolutely magnificent, quiet, with a typically British elegance.  Breakfast is fantastic and the afternoon tea an unmissable experience. Being hosted  in this hotel makes you feel at home away from home, thanks to the staff of an amazing standard."
August 2022,Perfect Stay with Exceptional Service,"My family had the pleasure of staying at the Milestone  on a recent trip to London.  The location is wonderful, just off Kensington Gardens and a short walk to both Kensington Palace and Hyde Park.  The service here is personable, professional and something all hotels should aim to achieve.  Every person we interacted with made us feel like an old friend and made an effort to get to know us better.  They treated us like royalty.  They also made special efforts to recognize and ensure my 12 year old had a great stay.  We will be back!"
September 2022,A lovely and special gem!,"From the moment we arrived at Milestone Hotel, we were greeted by Steve and instantly felt welcome. We had flown in early morning and were delighted when we were provided with an early check-in. We only stayed one night during a layover but wished we had been able to stayed for longer.   The room was spacious with a comfortable bed, there was a huge TV with a variety of shows and movies to watch, the bathroom was beautiful and the finer touches throughout the hotel and room made for a memorable experience.   The location of the hotel is perfect. We enjoyed a walk through the gardens opposite the hotel in the morning. We cannot wait to stay here again in future."
September 2022,London Visit,"What a lovely experience!  The team at the Milestone was very helpful and attentive and went the extra mile for us and made sure that we had what we needed. Even when they could jot accommodate a hosting tea, they arranged for it at a nearby hotel. My mother loved it! Thank you!"
August 2022,"Exquisite, we'll be back!","Staying at the Milestone was like coming home.  The moment we walked through the door we were treated like family!  There wasn’t one member of the entire staff, from the front desk to the concierge to the restaurant servers or bartender and right out to the doormen, that weren’t welcoming, helpful and working with smiles on their faces. Service throughout the hotel was impeccable.  Without a doubt we will return !!"
January 2022,A place that deserves more attention,"The best of the best. Customer service was outstanding and nothing was too much trouble. We felt like we were walking on air. Thank you to all the fantastic staff that clearly take pride in their work. We're planning on returning this year, and it can't come soon enough!"
February 2023,Magical. The place to stay in London.,"We stayed at the Milestone for 4 nights.  We had very high expectations from the reviews and the hotel website and we were not disappointed. The hotel is superb. Clean, comfortable and beautifully decorated. The staff were friendly, helpful and professional. We felt right at home. The afternoon tea was excellent. We also tried the bar which was also very good. The Milestone is our new address in London."
January 2023,Great cocktails,"Stopped by for a quick cocktail and ended up having more than planned! The bar service is fantastic and the cocktails did not disappoint, the most delicious cocktails I’ve had in London in a long time, I cannot wait to return!"
July 2022,Stunning,"The hotel is beautiful and has a boutique feel to it. The decor and appointment of our room was amazing, we loved the little touches like the fabric walls and individually decorated room. The staff are extremely attentive and friendly, they literally could not do enough for you. The complimentary drink upon arrival was unexpected but gratefully received after five hours of travelling. The attention to detail was beyond anything I have experienced anywhere and I travel quite a bit, the one thing that I loved was the ice cube in Las Dos Fridas drink- simple but so classy."
June 2023,Trip to London,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Milestone hotel, and I felt compelled to express my utmost appreciation for the outstanding hospitality and remarkable experience your esteemed establishment provided"
June 2023,A fantastic stay!,"My family and I just had such a magnificent time at the hotel!  The staff could not have been nicer nor more accommodating.  When we needed space for an after concert party, Leo and his staff even made special arrangements for us.  Our boys, 5 and 9, were left little presents.  The breakfast was amazing.  Our only regret was that our stay was so short."
May 2023,A little happyness in London,"The Milestone Hotel is a red and white brick building opposite Kensington Park and is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in. Location it’s a stone’s throw from the park and palace, Royal Albert Hall and Harrods. Our arrival by taxi from Paddington caused a minor commotion as the driver wanted cash as his card machine wasn’t working.  The doorman and reception charged the £22 fare to our room and paid the cabbie. Reception accompanied us to our first floor room and explained how everything worked and the 24hr Stable Bar – think Cheers – provided sustenance for the weary travellers who had forgotten how horrendous London traffic can be – queues were blamed on the new cycle lanes. The chocolates left on the pillows at turndown melted a little bit but housekeeping changed…"
May 2023,Fabulous hotel!,We came to stay the night before my daughter’s wedding and were treated superbly. We were given a room upgrade which was lovely and nothing was too much trouble. The staff were extremely attentive and the hotel itself was beautiful and luxurious!
May 2023,"Idyllic,  Intimate & Beautiful Hotel",We booked this hotel for our son & future daughter in law’s stay for the weekend of their wedding & I have to say that both the staff & the hotel were impeccable. The food was excellent & all the staff went out of their way to make us all feel so special.  Luxury in abundance.
May 2023,MISS,"This hotel was amazing , the staff were very attentive, friendly  and would help  you in any way they could without hesitation  The suite that we stayed in was out of this world, extremely clean, all your needs catered for and a very comfortable room  The small kindness of gifts on our pillow and in the room was exceptional and made our stay even more special,  with that personal touch The facilities were great and the meals in the hotel were outstanding We would definitely recommend this hotel, we could not fault it, and the location opposite Kensington park was perfect  We hope to visit again one day "
May 2023,A fabulous stay at the Milestone ,"Had a fantastic stay at the Milestone Hotel- I stayed for one night on the Sunday  when it was Coronation weekend, but wished I stayed more than that.  It's a beautiful hotel, and afyer checking in, I got shown round the hotel.  I was very impressed with the customer service - the little things like having a coffee delivered to your room after your wake-up call, tea, coffee facilities, box of biscuits, turn-down service - ensuring that you enjoy your stay.  I had dinner in the hotel (I had £70 credit for food and beverages) and used this for dinner - the chicken pie was delicious and the honeycomb ice cream was delicious too.  I really enjoyed my room which was a superior queen room.  I will definitely stay in thr hotel again."
May 2023,Best 5 Star Hotel Experience in the UK,"Exceptional experience in the best 5 star hotel i have stayed in (UK).  From the moment we were greeted at the door, handing over the car keys to have the car parked, to the moment the car was returned a couple of days later was a fantastic experience. The Welcoming was warm & professional.  The Room it self was over 2 floors.  Beautiful looking shower room.  The Bed was so big and comfortable.  The Wall to wall mirrors was a nice surprise bar a few windows.  Considering the location, it was so peaceful and quiet.  The TV quality was excellent.  A real bug bear of mine when you stay in nice hotels.  We had full access to SKY and BT. Sport.   The Breakfast was excellent.  I really couldnt fault the stay and would highly recommend to anyone considering in staying in a nice Hotel…"
April 2023,Amazing Place and People!,"This is a grand old hotel.  Frome the first day we walked in, it felt friendly.  Everyone was friendly and fun. Steve (the Doorman), Steve (concierge), Dino, Renato, Tim (the Doorman), Grant, Fran, and Claire were some of the funnest. The afternoon tea was grand, and their signature sandwich was very tasty.  Compliments to the Chef.  This is one of the places that we will try to come back to."
April 2023,Our best experience in years,"The service was so good that now we have been spoilt and will find it hard to like any other Hotel. Everyone was super pleasant and warm. It felt like we were staying with family (the good ones). The whole experience was top notch. Be it the rooms, the afternoon tea, the Bar and the dining. We absolutely will be going back again "
July 2022,"If you like to be treated as royalty, you should stay here.....","My wife and I travel a lot for pleasure and always try to stay in nice hotels.  This was our second visit to the Milestone and it was every bit as good as the first visit, if not better.  The staff go out of their way to make your stay as enjoyable as possible.  Everyone from the doormen to the food and beverage staff, to the housekeeping staff did a wonderful job of making our stay unforgettable.  The concierge staff is beyond compare as they worked tirelessly to help us with the events and activities that we wanted to enjoy while in London.  The Milestone will always be my first choice of hotels to stay at when in London, and if you enjoy being pampered and made to feel like royalty, you will stay here as well."
July 2022,Exceptional In Every Way,"My daughter and I had been to tea at the Milestone a few times and loved it in the past, so when planning our July 2022 visit we decided to book our week long stay there. The hotel and staff greatly exceeded our expectations. We booked a Deluxe King/Twin and stayed in room 103 - extremely quiet, interior view. A front desk staff gave us a quick hotel tour and escorted us to our room and acquainted us with its features and offered us a welcome beverage - room service also delivered a mini welcome cake and biscuits with our champagne. The bathroom was well lit, had ample towels and built in nightlight - great water pressure in shower/bath. Bed linens were luxurious -  housekeeping visited twice a day -  we enjoyed turn down service  and the lit candle in the bathroom. Two robes…"
July 2022,This hotel and staff should not be missed!,"From getting out of the cab... to making our way to reception... to a brief and useful 'tour' ... to our being taken to our room. and on and on... EVERY PERSON was professional, personable, capable and attentive. We've stayed all over the world at top hotels and this is one we'd return to when we return to London. EVERY aspect was A+++."
July 2022,Friendly fussy hotel,"the staff went to great lengths to make our family feel welcome. the location is lovely for visits to museums, parks and high streets. views of Kensington gardens were lovely and the boys reported that the breakfast was delectable. dated glam decor retained some charm"
June 2022,How do you spell perfection?,Perfect in details large and small They couldn’t do enough to make us feel welcomed and comfy.  From the welcome cake to the turn down treats that changed nightly to the linen bed mats so one’s feet do not have to touch the carpet as one puts on the provided slippers.  Experience luxury in a splendid location across from Kensington Palace.
July 2022,Great hotel,"Great hotel great location excellent friendly staff and it’s gorgeous.  Kensington is also a great neighborhood to visit, Sade with lots to do and lots to see. Highly rrecommend all day!! If you go tell them we said hello lol."
July 2022,Wonderful stay !,"Our stay was truly amazing! The wonderful staff was really kind and the service level is extremely high. Everything comes together if you have the privilege to spend some days at this wonderful hotel. The service, the room, the amenities, the little things make a difference. It feels like spending time with family abroad. When in London this is the place to stay!"
July 2022,Exceptional hotel!,"The hotel is beautiful, in a great location and the staff was nothing short of spectacular!  One of the best hotel experiences we have ever enjoyed!  Highly recommend.  Close to the tube, right across the street from Kensington Palace/Hyde Park."
July 2022,A Week at the Historical Milestone Hotel,"Words cannot describe the magical week we had in London. Our family of 4 began our holiday at the beautiful and magestic Milestone Hotel. We have travelled to many countries and stayed at many hotels, but we have never experienced the level of service as we did at the Milestone. We flew in from Australia at 6am, went straight to the hotel. They welcomed us with complementary breakfast and coffee, because our rooms were not ready. If you come to London for the history, then you must visit the Milestone. The breakfast room is just beautiful. The details in the furniture, colours, walls, pictures are just stunning. The service at the front desk, concierge, doorman, dining room and at turn down service is sheer perfection. So generous, genuine and so accommodating, nothing was too…"
April 2023,A perfect Milestone stay,"From the moment we were greeted at the door, we knew The Milestone would be our home away from home. The impeccable staff made us feel so welcome, and the service provided was always extended with warmth and a smile. Hotel staff is a reflection of management, and this carefully curated crew takes their cue from the delightful and charming GM, Andrew Pike.   The rooms were inviting, with wonderful beds, antiques throughout, beautifully appointed marble bathrooms, and every amenity one could want.  If morning tea or coffee is your thing, just ask, and a huge box containing cups, kettle, a French press, and drinks will be provided. The lounge, restaurant, and bar make you feel like you’re in an English manor house, and the servers are happy to chat with you about sightseeing, or…"
March 2023,Loved this hotel!,"Recently stayed at this beautiful hotel in the heart of Kensington...location and condition of the property were amazing, but it was really the staff that took the experience to another level. Truly everyone was helpful; however, there were a few team members who stood out including Renato, Steve, Tim, Angelo and Victoria. Next trip to London will definitely include a stay at this wonderful hotel."
April 2023,Amazing Wedding reception!!,"My husband and I had our wedding reception at the Milestone. The service and food was impeccable and the staff were just fantastic. Right from the attention to detail  and all the help they provided, could not fault them at all. The events coordinator, Emma was fantastic and so so helpful with the planning and organisation of the day. We were on a tight budget, where a lot of other venues we looked at were so inflexible with certain things and made us feel like we had to pay and arm and a leg, the Milestone worked within our budget (within reason of course) to help us achieve what we wanted on the day.  Really felt like they went above and beyond to make our day that extra special.  Highly recommend them for small parties, weddings and events!!"
April 2023,My 3rd time staying here and it is like a second home. Just a great place to stay.,"This is my 3rd stay at this hotel. That is because  I really like staying at the Milestone. Whenever we've been out for a full day in London, coming back to the hotel is very comfortable and relaxing. Getting a drink from Lilo in the bar is something I look forward to every day I am there. The staff at the hotel are all very welcoming and friendly, and the location is  good with nice rooms with views over Kensington Gardens. The breakfast room is very cozy, and the bedrooms are all really quite nice. They run a great operation.   "
February 2023,"More than amazing, words can’t explain","Amazing amazing amazing!!!!! Me and my fiancé booked for one night for our anniversary and… well!! i’ve never enjoyed myself more!!!!! When we entered we were introduced with lovely staff with smiles (Heather at reception and Zen who gave us a building tour and entry). The hotel had upgraded us (for free!!) from a standard room to the Mistinguett Suite (!) and it was more than beautiful- the room was lush with a balcony, in hotel fresh homemade cookies and tea. They also gave us a free cocktail each upon entry (both of which that aren’t on their bar cocktail menu).   My fiancé had left a booking note that it was for our anniversary and when we arrived after our meal our room had been tidied and been set up with chocolates on the pillows with rose petals, candles too, and a plate…"
January 2023,Our wedding at the Milestone Hotel,"In January this year we got married at the Milestone Hotel, and let me tell you, It was the best decision we've made!  The ceremony, reception, dinner and the party were all held at the hotel and we cannot complain about one thing. Everything was well organised, food was delicious, staff was incredibly attentive and our wedding suite was just stunning.   Emma, our Banqueting Executive, was in constant communication with us throughout the whole process, making sure that everything was organised as we requested, and nothing was a problem for her. She really tried to accommodate every request we had.  So, If you are looking for a small wedding venue, combined with british luxury, this is it. Don't look no further!  "
March 2023,Amazing!,"Amazing service and accommodations.   Super location, within walking distance to some really good restaurants.  Didn’t dine in much except for Breakfast - but that menu is outstanding. Concierge & Staff go above and beyond expectations. 5-Star hotel all the way."
April 2023,Great stay in early April,"Beautiful spaces in this hotel. Moderate sized well appointed room  Exceptional service staff Exceptional meals Easy access to bus, underground within a few blocks. Cross the street to Kensington Park and Palace The fitness room is bright and well appointed with jacuzzi/ pool room attached. Sauna  Highly recommended hotel- we will stay again!"
April 2023,Luxe in London,"What an absolutely wonderful hotel. Everything was perfect. The hotel is spotless with the ideal blend of historic charm and luxe, modern decor and amenities. My daughter and I were treated with such kindness. We had high tea which was fabulous and decided to upgrade to a room with a view of the park. Truly incredible. The hotel is perfectly located near the UnderGround…we were able to get everywhere with ease. There is a Santander bike spot 2 blocks away so we were able to rent 2 bikes and cycle Hyde Park…a highlight of our trip. The Milestone is a true 5-star hotel. I can’t imagine a better way to experience London."
February 2023,"Luxurious in many respects, but missing the RCH personal touch","My wife and I had a 3 night stay at The Milestone recently, at a rate of £430 per night for bed and breakfast. The Red Carnation brand is familiar to us, having stayed 15 times in 6 properties from their portfolio previously. The brand gives us a number of things that we require as guests in a hotel, including luxurious surroundings, a peaceful night’s sleep on a quality mattress and bedding, good food and wine, but perhaps most important of all – quality, personal service. All this doesn’t come cheap as rates usually start at around £250 in all hotels in the portfolio. The brand has also started adding an ‘optional’ service charge per night recently.  Having stayed at Summer Lodge in Dorset during August 2022, we decided to give The Milestone a try for the first time since the…"
June 2022,Exceptional hotel,"We visited the hotel in late June for a one night stay. It was one of the best hotel experiences we ever had. We were upgraded to a beautiful suite and the staff could not have been nicer. When we were booking in they enquired if we wanted refreshments sent to the room and they organised a very early breakfast for us as they knew we had to be at the airport at the crack of dawn.  The suite was very elegant, with very comfortable beds and situated in a very quiet part of the hotel.  The location is great, directly opposite Hyde park and down the road from the Royal Albert Hall. We will definitely book this hotel again."
June 2022,"Lovely Hotel, First Class Service","My daughter and I stayed here for a week on a post-pandemic trip to London to celebrate her birthday and make up for all the fun we didn't get to have during the pandemic.  I could not have chosen better than this lovely hotel to serve as our home base.  Everything about it was just perfect.  Every employee provided wonderful service.  The room was spotless and so comfortable.  Kensington is a charming part of the city and provides easy access to all parts of London you might want to visit.  I was especially struck by how much the staff cared about us.  Such nice touches as ensuring my business meeting one afternoon went off without a hitch, sending us off to the airport with a box of pastries, tea and coffee sent to the room on an early morning tour day, helping us with…"
June 2022,Delicious afternoon tea,"We were lucky to be treated to afternoon tea at the Milestone today and it was delicious.  There is a full tea menu available.  The selection of sandwiches was excellent and the signature chicken sandwich particularly tasty. The cakes were all fantastic, my favourite being the lavender and Earl Grey macaron especially created to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee. We finished off with great scones jam and clotted cream.  Lastly, the staff were friendly and attentive. I would highly recommend this for a special treat."
June 2022,the staff was incredible,The rooms were comfortable and we loved the location as well.  Hyde park is directly across the street and we really enjoyed walking through it on our way to various parts of London.  You can always get a taxi easy from this location.  The breakfast was great and the team even better.
June 2022,Superb,"I heard of the Milestone from my cousin in London.  It did not disappoint.  High class amenities with detailed oriented service.  Right at the Kensington High Street, you can go shopping or go for a walk in the park.  They have a pool, gym and a sauna.  American style outlets in the room for American guests was a great touch too.  Do the Afternoon Tea if you can!  It was incredible."
June 2022,Perfection,"What can you say about a perfect stay being taken care of by some of the best of the best in the hotel industry, except everything was perfection  From the staff to the food, the rooms to the bed and pillows I cannot fault anything   Rarely am I sad to leave a hotel but I was when I had to leave the Milestone  I cannot imagine staying anywhere else when in London"
May 2022,I didn't want to leave,"I can't express how much we enjoyed our stay at the Milestone. I'm very picky but can't find a thing I'd complain about. The service was over-the-top friendly and impeccable. The employees treated us like family. Jose the concierge planned our days and made reservations to some wonderful restaurants. He also went overboard when he retrieved and shipped my husband's cell phone from the train station lost property office. He wouldn't take a tip for that!   The room was beautiful, well appointed, comfortable and solidly quiet. The hotel was just lovely. Breakfast was delicious.  I can't wait to stay again on my next trip to London."
May 2022,Excellent service,"We chose Milestone to be the venue of our special day and we’re glad that we did. The service that was given was fantastic! Leo was very responsive with all the queries and made sure that everything went according to plan. He even accomdated our last minute alterations which was a very big bonus.  I also commend the amazing and friendly staff, they always make you feel that you’re valued and give their 100% best. A thank you is an understatement for making our special day more special and memorable. Milestone is definitely a highly recommended hotel, with a very accomdating and superb staff. You will surely find your stay worthwhile."
May 2022,A home away from home,"We arrived for a 2 week stay to find our 2 BR Residence already supplied with plenty of food in the fully equipped kitchen, including washer and Dryer and dishwasher.  With a little exploring, we found several food stores, the Goat Tavern and a wonderful little Italian restaurant just down the block.   Many of our favorite museums are within a short walk.  If we needed to go further afield, the Kensington High tube station and bus stops were very convenient.  All of that was wonderful, but the very best part of staying at the Milestone was the staff!  To a person, each was unfailingly helpful from a bucket of ice and a lemon in our apartment daily at 5 PM to directions and recommendations as well as attentive listening to our adventures at the end of the day.  I really can't…"
June 2022,Amazing Hospitality,"We just checked out of the Milestone after a wonderful stay. Starting with the service and hospitality, it was simply perfect. Everyone working at the hotel including Jose and Steve are so generous and kind. Our room was very unique and comfortable. The Milestone truly makes you feel at home and I would highly recommend this hotel. Next time I am in London, I would like to return!"
January 2023,Excellent service and great cocktails,"I went with my friends to have couple of drinks and the drinks were amazing along with the staff. The ambience of the bar itself is amazing. I will like to praise victoria and angelo for thier lovely and warm service, I am definately gonna go back again."
December 2022,"Fabulous hotel and staff, memorable stay","Enjoyed a fantastic few days during the second week of December 2022 at this amazing hotel.  I have stayed at other Red Carnation properties in London and they are all amazing.  I have always wanted to stay at the Milestone and was thrilled that I was able to do.  Everything was exceptional and I can highly recommend a stay here.  Firstly, I was to visit London at this time with my best friend with whom I had travelled to London (and beyond) for 30 years.  This would have been our 30th anniversary of travelling as our first stay was in London early December 1992. Unfortunately, she was diagnosed with a terminal illness at the end of August and sadly passed away at the end of September.  Initially I did not feel like going ahead with the visit to London but decided to go ahead on…"
December 2022,Quintessential London Hotel,"Whenever I travel to London, I make a point of staying at a different hotel every time I go, just to get a different experience every time am there.  That is now going to change, as I will be staying at the Milestone Hotel for all my future visits to London.  In addition to the hotel being incredibly charming, the staff was above and beyond accommodating and helpful.  The Milestone is a perfect representation of London."
January 2023,One of the Best Ever,"I’ve stayed over 1000 nights in hotels across the world and I can honestly say Milestone is in the top 5.  The most differentiated aspected was the service over our 5 days there. Everyone was so kind, pleasant and attentive. Highly recommend."
December 2022,Milestone Offers Top Notch Accommodations and Service!,"Loved my stay at The Milestone Hotel! From my room, which was beautifully decorated and very posh, to the amazing staff who always greeted me with a smile and were so helpful in helping me navigate the city above and beyond what was expected, I cannot say enough great things. Food was excellent too! Would suggest trying the Eggs Benedict for breakfast and, if you're looking for a late night bite, head to the lounge and order the to-die-for Wagyu Brisket Burger (sooooo good!). Their Old Fashioned, served in a smoky cloche, is a showstopper too. All in all, I highly recommend staying at The Milestone and hope to visit again soon!"
December 2022,"High Service, High Comfort","We have learned that the first three days after arriving in the UK from the States demand the most pampering — the shattered sleep schedules, the weariness, the need for the most comfortable beds, darkest rooms, and most helpful service. The Milestone has become our go-to retreat.   We have been continuously surprised at how the entire team goes out of their way to provide the highest service, even little acts of kindness for bleary travelers. This culture of caring drives the entire team without exception.   The quality of the facility is top drawer, from spa to bed pillows. The rooms are quiet, even those looking out over Kensington's busy high street to the Park. We have found them to be without fault. Its location is extraordinarily convenient to shopping and business, yet…"
December 2022,A True Gem in The Heart of Kensington,"A true gem in the heart of Kensington right across the street from Kensington Palace. Room/Suite was outstanding, Dining superb, afternoon tea delightful and the staff was most accommodating. Highly recommended! If you are in London, stay here and thank me later."
December 2022,A Home from Home in the heart of London,"From Steve's truly 'Londoner' welcome at the front entrance of this wonderful establishment  - and (currently) my favourite in the Red Carnations Hotel Group - I know why it was worth returning to such a family-oriented Home from Home.    I'm very grateful that you made my return stay extra special and gave my Mother a wonderful time full of memories she will talk about for years to come.    Thank you Emma (Front Desk), John (Concierge), Grant, Paolo, Donna (Restaurant), Heather and Lilu (Bar) and the great Bobby (Maintenance).     They all helped to make my stay fantastic.    I'm looking forward to returning again soon."
August 2022,Outstanding Service,"The Milestone is our hotel of choice when visiting London. The staff and the service they provide are outstanding and we are on a first name basis with most everyone we interact with: Zdravko, Zen, Steve, Tim, Lillo, Angelo, Leo, Renato, Yulia, Claire, and Heather. The food and bar service are excellent, the rooms are comfortable and well appointed. We love staying at the Milestone."
August 2022,Perfect!,"A truly *perfect* hotel experience, with some of the warmest, most personal service we have ever received! We stayed in July/August for five nights, dined in the restaurant and also had afternoon tea.  There are so many things to celebrate about this gem of a property -- a generous room upgrade, fantastic breakfast in the beautiful Cheneston's, above-and-beyond turndown service -- but one fun anecdote in particular: my son mentioned to one of the staff members that his birthday fell during our trip and we would be taking a steam train outing to celebrate. We returned home on his birthday evening to a birthday cake, a steam train toy, and a very sweet personalized birthday card signed by 15 of the staff. My son was so overjoyed and felt really special! We've barely departed but…"
August 2022,Wonderful hotel!,"Milestone has this special atmosphere and brilliant service that makes us come back again and again. Great location opposite Kensington Gardens, friendly and caring people, luxury feeling. We will be back😄"
August 2022,Afternoon Tea,We had a lovely Afternoon Tea at the Milestone on our London visit. The staff were extremely kind and accommodating. The property was charming. The tea service was excellent. The food and presentation were excellent. We were served by Tatiana who took good care of us and kept us entertained as well.
August 2022,THE Best Boutique Hotel in London Bar None!,"The Milestone Hotel, in London's Kensington neighborhood, is exceptional in so many ways, and at the very top of the long list is their customer service. Every member of their staff loves their job and their colleagues, which translates into an environment that feels like an extended family is welcoming you into their luxurious, mini palace, and their one-and-only priority is for you to have a perfect holiday experience.  The concierge staff is particularly gifted at their craft, and the location, just opposite Kensington Palace & Gardens, is perfect. An oasis of luxury wrapped in the warmth, kindness, and gratitude of a close-knit, happy family. Book your stay early. Both The Milestone Hotel, in Kensington, and its sister hotel The Egerton House, in Knightsbridge, were fully…"
July 2022,Home away from home,"From the moment my husband and I stepped into the lobby, we were made feel welcome and at home. The receptionist showed us around, made sure to introduce us to the wait staff in the restaurant and in the bar, all of whom welcomed us by name when we came back. The attention to detail throughout the property (restaurant, bar and the room) were unparalleled - and we can hardly wait to come back for a longer stay."
July 2022,We splurged and spent two nights here,We really enjoyed this hotel. We could afford it because COVID had lowered prices at the time. Staff was wonderful. Just a beautiful hotel. The only downside was that it wasn't particularly close to anything except the Kensington Gardens. But that's a small issue. We are really glad we stayed here.
November 2021,An oasis of luxurious calm!,"A truly excellent hotel offering an oasis of luxurious calm in the centre of London. Situated opposite Kensington gardens and less than half a mile from Albert Hall, the Milestone offers everything one could reasonably expect from a great hotel. Attentive and helpful staff, great rooms, leisure facilities, fine restaurants and a cosy bar. Marvellous!"
July 2022,You will feel special!,"An amazing boutique hotel. You will feel special and appreciated. Loved the open bar area and the breakfast. The rooms were cozy, patted, with a bidet. They have a nice rain shower. Close to everything. A cool night club in front. This is my place to stay in London."
July 2022,Thank you Milestone Hotel,"Most cosy, hospitable and beautiful hotel in London, amazing location on Kensington Park, with stunning views of the park. We were blessed to spend 8 magical days (7 nights) at the hotel over the last week of December, the rooms are spotless and comfortable, the beds are warm, the public areas are delightful - especially breakfast room and bar - but the most important ingredient is the impeccable service of the  kind and friendly staff!! Thank you Milestone hotel team for helping us to enjoy a wonderful family holiday in London!! (if I have to mention some limitations - pool and gym are quite small, but worked fine for our needs) "
December 2022,As always a wonderful stay,While visiting family in London my wife and I have stayed at the Milestone many many times over the last 12 years . We have stayed in practically all the rooms and the apartments. We have never been disappointed in anything. We are always made to feel at home and taken care of by the wonderful staff. As a retired architect I appreciate the careful design. Our grandchildren think breakfast at The Milestone is the best. The Milestone has organized fabulous birthday teas for our grands in the hotel and  in Kensington Park. 
December 2022,Outstanding Christmas stay,"We stayed here for 4 nights in the Princess Suite over Christmas and my partner and I both agree that it was the best Christmas stay we’ve ever had anywhere. The Milestone totally nailed it with their amazing staff and their outstanding food. It is the staff that sets this hotel apart from others - everyone is so friendly and attentive - nothing is too much trouble. We stayed here a few years ago and we think it was even better this time (and it was a hard act to follow). We had the afternoon tea which was exquisite (the Mistress tea was recommended and did not disappoint), we loved the Christmas Eve Dinner and thought having Carol singers was a lovely touch but the best for me personally was the Christmas Lunch along with a visit from Santa and a Harpist. Outstanding food and…"
July 2023,Perfection,The British sure know how to do it right.  Everything from the rooms to the staff were on point and their attention to detail was perfect.  High tea was delicious and fun and all our meals memorable.  I would move in here if I could!
July 2023,"Quintessentially British hotel, great location, great service",The best service I have had from a hotel stay. Nothing is too much trouble. All the staff were extremely knowledgeable and go out of their way to ensure you have a perfect stay. The breakfast was outstanding and we spent a leisurely 2 hours enjoying it without feeling like we had to leave.
May 2023,Much better return 3rd visit ,"We returned to The Milestone Hotel at the request of the management, after a very disappointing second stay for a 40th birthday at the beginning of the year.   Happily, our experience was much better the third time around. Check-in was pleasant and although there was no initial offer of a welcome drink, this was rectified once we called room service to order a coffee after settling into our rooms.   We stayed in two interconnecting king rooms which were beautifully decorated, one of the rooms having a fabulous view of Kensington gardens. A pre-arrival request for birthday decorations in my daughter's room had been fulfilled by the hotel and executed to perfection. A little cake and a personalised card from the hotel manager were very much appreciated and helped to make my…"
June 2023,Wedding 💍,"A massive thank you to The Milestone Hotel for hosting our wedding. We were very fortunate to frequent this place over the years so thought it the ideal place to host our special day. From the organisation, food, flowers and service, everything was lovely ❤️👌🏽 If your looking for a  venue to host a small intimate day we would definitely recommend. a special thank you to Emma and Leo for their exceptional service!"
July 2023,Very nice,"There really is only one thing keeping this from being the perfect hotel in London.  They need to bring back the buffet breakfast.  As it is breakfast is absurdly overpriced and takes forever.  That said, it's the only thing about the place which isn't incredibly well done.  The staff is friendly and attentive and the rooms/location were great.  Great location with a short walk to Whole Foods, the Swan pond in Kensington, not far from the tube, etc."
July 2023,MAGNIFICENT,At first we were a little uncomfortable with the fuss but we soon realised it was just plain impeccable service that is unmatched.  Being from Australia you hesitate with our dollar being times 2 but if you can afford it is worth every penny.  The rooms are thoughtful and so comfortable with the housekeepers being second to none with personal touches.  The highlight of our stay was the Stables Bar which has so much charisma and history and the cocktails are as good as I’ve had anywhere in the world.  Look forward to enjoying it even better next time. 
May 2023,The Milestone Hotel in the heart of London,"Outstanding hotel - location, service, and the full experience. Our room was very nice and comfortable. The staff was very polite and helpful. We hand our breakfast included in our package. We’ll  stay there again on our next visit. "
July 2023,What a Treat to Stay at the Milestone!!,"The Milestone was such a treat for our trip to London!  It's truly the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in.  The rooms are beautiful, the beds were so comfortable, the food is fabulous, and the service is the best I've ever had at a hotel.  The staff was so kind and accommodating.  We loved the treats they left for us during the turn down service and a few special treats as we attended Wimbledon and the staff made the experience really special.  The location was perfect as it's right across the street from Kensington Park.  If you have Tea in London, The Milestone is the place to have it.  It was such a treat in the beautifully designed restaurant.    We will definitely be back and I would recommend The Milestone for a vacation or a business trip.   It's the very best!!"
July 2023,Best hotel stay ever.,"The best hotel me and my wife has ever stopped in.  The staff were amazing the room was impeccably clean. The breakfast was fresh and well cooked We both couldn’t fault anything, which is a first for London. We would recommend this hotel without hesitation.  10 out of 10."
June 2023,The most lavishly beautiful welcome to London,"From the tiny copy of Jane Austen classics and mint chocolates on the bed at turn-down service, to the remarkable and unique dining experience at Cheneston's downstairs (try the pie!), this historic, elegant boutique will become a holiday hallmark. Located just a couple of minutes walk from High Street Kensington tube station, the suites are magnificent (we stayed in the The Noel Coward Suite and it had the most incredible bathroom!), and the staff are one of the friendliest, most hospitable bunch I have encountered (and I travel a lot! I was offered hand-written notes with recommended sights to visit and foods to try). If you're looking for a beautiful, luxury stay with all the English bells and whistles, this one is for you. We will return."
January 2023,BEST BIRTHDAY TEA EVER!,"A couple weeks ago I was visiting London for my 40th birthday with over 20 women from the States. I contacted the Milestone and several other venues to see who could accommodate our group for a High Tea. Not only was the Milestone the most communicative and not price prohibitive, but their facilities looked amazing from the pictures; so it was an easy choice to make.   Then over the months leading up to the event, the staff was so helpful and kind, I was confident I make the right choice. From flowers to dietary restrictions, they were able to handle everything! (They even found nondairy butter for one of my friends who has a severe dairy allergy).   The day of the Tea the staff was extremely professional, friendly, and helpful. Every single woman in attendance raved and…"
January 2023,Better than Home away from Home,"When our 9 and 11 year old heard we were going to London for a quick trip they asked if we were staying at ""the amazing hotel that brought us cookies and tea"". You can't help but fall in love with the Milestone Hotel. From the minute the door opens with the warmest greeting and that those in the Hotel are truly happy to see and help you. We travel a lot and I can assure you this a rare thing for hotels these days. The effort and care is consistent with every stay (and we keep going back) and each person we come across. Andrew Pike and his Team are truly special, thank you for always ensuring we leave happy and excited for the next visit."
January 2023,Lovely London Stay,"The level of attention and care was second to none.  Each staff member was engaging and thoughtful- they knew our names.  The rooms were spacious, VERY clean.  Location was perfect!  Close to museums, parks, shopping, the Tube…  We were pampered, and made to feel as if we were special guests.  "
January 2023,Our new favourite London Hotel!,"We have officially found my new favourite London hotel! The Milestone in Kensington.  After much searching online and wanting to discover a different place from our two other (now former!) favourite London hotels, I came across this incredible find. I booked a beautiful king deluxe room for 3 nights to celebrate my husband's birthday as it looked traditional, cosy, classy, had all the facilities we wanted and most of all, it looked special. It did not disappoint! From the point of booking and discussing details over the phone with the booking team to the clear and friendly email communication prior to our visit, it left me excited in the lead up to our stay!  From the warm and welcoming arrival, the beautiful exterior of the building and history of the hotel we walked in with a…"
January 2023,Beautiful hotel great location,"My first visit as I usually go to hotel 41, I thought this hotel was charming with beautiful rooms. I will definitely be back at some point and highly recommend it. The conservatory and bar area are quaint and cosy, the breakfasts and meal we booked were of a high standard."
January 2023,Surpassing my expectation every time!,"As always, The Milestone Team surpass my expectations every time.   From the warmest of welcomes at the Front Desk by Lenora, to the accommodating manner when I arrived extra early.   To the fun and intimately familial conversations with Steven at the front door.    I was very grateful that Lenora and Lino offered me the use of the conservatory to host my meetings, and Callum furnishing me with a lovely (complimentary) pot of tea and your delicious cookies pack.  It was an absolute pleasure to meet Zen again, as she'd supported me with pre-arrival preparations.  It only got better and better as my stay progressed.     The beautiful upgrade was a lovely surprise and even more special was the little gift so expertly wrapped in red tissue.   So thoughtful and above and beyond the…"
January 2023,Beyond the excellence,"We  had dinner at the hotel and we were simply astonished by the extreme care for the client, by the excellent cuisine and , last but not least, by the settings of the table, including silver or Sheffield underplates . When originality meets tradition that’s the Britishness we love and that must not be lost. The very kind employees let us visit the rooms and we are thinking of staying there when in London: as I wrote in the title they are beyond the excellence. Sometimes dreams come true."
January 2023,What a fantastic weekend celebrating my wife's birthday,"I'm not sure I can add more than what most people have said about this hotel, except for simply ""Wow"".  From the moment we arrived, you are treated with such warmth.  Sam, who checked us in, took us around the hotel explaining the history of the hotel and you could just tell the passion he had for it.  You instantly feel apart of the family and the hotel is just so eloquently decorated, and feels so warm and cozy.    We had booked a deluxe King which was sufficient for us, as we were planning on being out majority of the time.  The room was lovely and again the quality of the finish and decorations was amazing (maybe just firmer pillows would be nice).  Sam was very happy to show us how everything worked.  As we were celebrating my wife's birthday, Sam kindly offered us a…"
January 2023,Wonderful Bar,"Few days ago I went with my friends to the Bar at Milestone , the place looks Beautifull! Cocktails were delicious , but the Best thing was a service! Victoria bartender was fantastic, great service with a smile !  Angelo ( I Hope I wrote name correctly) bar manager was also fantastic! Highly recommended!"
January 2023,Absolutely the BEST ,"For a top of the line meal the Milestone cannot be beat. The atmosphere is awesome. The wait staff is top notch. The prices are at the top end as well. We had dinner and our waiter, Angelos was absolutely the best!! He’s from a well trained British service that leaves nothing to chance. His attention to detail is impeccable. The food and presentation were out of this world. For a special occasion I don’t think you could do any better than the Milestone!"
March 2023,An AMAZING afternoon Tea experience!!,"A wonderful Afternoon Tea! The staff were helpful, friendly and went above and beyond to ensure we had all we needed/wanted. A great time was thoroughly enjoyed and the beautiful settings of the hotel made it a luxurious event celebrating my mums upcoming birthday. The Afternoon tea was fresh, scrumptious and the best I’ve had in London yet! I would recommend anyone to try it and I look forward to returning to try out some more of their food menu. Thank you Milestone Staff x "
April 2023,Beautiful Afternoon Tea - Fantastic service,Beautiful afternoon tea at the Milestone hotel yesterday. The highlights for my was the delicious chicken sandwich rolled in almonds and the black sesame seed macaroon - but in all honesty the whole offering was great and there was an abundance of food. The service we received was great and nothing was too much for them. 
March 2023,Wonderful experience,"Our recent stay at Milestone hotel and residences was excellent. Hotel staff including front desk, house keeping were outstanding . The service was very attentive, we especially appreciated the thoughtfulness of the Front desk, concierge and restaurant service staff who arranged for our breakfast and coffee in “to go” containers when we were running late for a day trip. We look forward to staying at Milestone residences again in future. "
March 2023,Best hotel,"Pleased with my visit to this hotel. The staff was very friendly, efficient, helpful. They greeted me every time, help find transportation and provided good places to visit. The room was fantastic, they kept it clean. The tea experience was wonderful."
March 2023,Felt so special going back,"Went back for couple of drinks in the Stables Bar, met with some of the familiar faces. They truly know how to care for the guest and staffs. Thank you for coming to say hello Mr Pike, Tom and Pranav. ND"
March 2023,My Favorite Place To Stay In London,"I could not have been more pleased with my visit to this hotel.  (A second visit to the Red Carnation Group).  Staff was superior!  All were friendly, efficient, helpful courteous, and yes, kind!  They remembered my name and greeted me, by name, each time I returned for the night.  The room was fantastic and tea/breakfast/dinner, wonderful.  Highly recommend this hotel!"
March 2023,Utterly gorgeous,"An absolutely delightful experience from start to finish. The care and kindness shown to my little girl and I made it feel like home.  I honestly cannot rate this hotel and the staff highly enough. We walked into a gorgeous room, which had a vast array of the most magical little touches. The staff went to great lengths to make my daughter feel comfortable, explaining how things worked and being generally loving and attentive.   The service here rivals the Savoy and we will most certainly be back..  Thankyou again"
March 2023,The Milestone is a London Must,"  The Milestone is synonymous with high quality service, sumptuous state-of-the-art accommodation within an impeccable period-held property maintained to a sensitive high level of detail and attention with a respectful nostalgic nod to a bygone era of historic luxury London. For the best English Breakfast in quality and service in London not forgetting The Milestone’s reputed Afternoon Tea with a unique sandwich included, designed by the Founder and President of the Red Carnation Hotel Collection Bea Tollman, to be enjoyed in a quintessential English setting, look no further. The characterful Stables Bar offers a great setting for memorable Cocktails savoured. It’s for all these reasons we have found reason to check-in no less than 60 times in the last 12 years and counting. You…"
March 2023,Wonderful stay,"We recently stayed at this hotel during a weekend trip to London and we absolutely loved it! The staff were so friendly and welcoming and couldn’t do enough to make sure we had a wonderful stay. So many thoughtful touches. We love that the hotel has kept its old world charm and traditional elements. The cocktail lounge and restaurant are beautiful. Our room was quite small (we just booked a superior queen) but quiet with good air conditioning. Next time we stay we would go for a king room. Good location for us, close to the museums and tube station as well as Kensington palace. We will definitely be back! This hotel has great reviews and they definitely deserve it. The staff are what really makes this hotel stand out! 5 star ⭐️"
March 2023,Pampered Experience at the Lovely Milestone Hotel,The service at this hotel was top notch and the rooms were beautiful.  We particularly liked the Stable area which was right off the bar.  It was a small room where our family gathered and enjoyed an excellent late meal and hand crafted cocktails.  The hotel was in a nice area across from Kensington castle and park with beautiful homes and embassy buildings nearby.  I would recommend this hotel to others who travel to London for work or pleasure.
October 2023,Husbands 50 th. ,The Milestone is so friendly welcoming and the staff couldn’t do enough for my family and I and my dog Meg !  We celebrated my husbands 50 th birthday and it was simply amazing.  What a lovely way to celebrate.  Many thanks Clare Tony and of course Meg !  Xx
October 2023,Truly 5 star experience,"My experience at the Milestone was every bit the 5 star experience I was hoping for. From the doorman's greeting and immediate attention on the way in to the doorman seeing us safely into our taxi on the way out (and quite literally every single member of staff I saw in between) everyone was warm and welcoming, helpful, cheerful, knowledgeable and just plain wonderful. Everything was clean. The food was fantastic. Attention to detail within the rooms and without. Stylish and classic combined. Truly a terrific stay! Highly recommended! Enjoy!"
October 2023,Top notch experience!,We enjoyed an incredible week at the Milestone. Their afternoon tea was amazing and quite filling and the room it is served in is really quite opulent. Our dinner there was probably some of the best food we’ve ever had in London… truly delicious. The bar is so much fun and very much like an exclusive private club. The staff was incredible…always there to help with our every need. We will be back to our new “home” in London very soon I hope!
October 2023,One of the best hotels that we have stayed in! Highly recommend!,"We had a fantastic stay at The Milestone! The highlight for us was the staff. They were very friendly, helpful, attentive and extremely well-trained. Nothing was too much trouble.  All areas of the hotel are luxurious and well cared for. Lovely touches in our room. We ate breakfast and afternoon tea at the hotel and both were delicious. Great location opposite Kensignton Gardens and less than a 10 minute walk to the tube station. Will definitely be making a return visit!"
October 2023,Amazing experience ,"This hotel is literally the best I have ever stayed in. The room left me speechless, it was absolutely beautiful. Immaculately clean and luxurious. The staff were all very warm, friendly and welcoming, they catered to my every need. Nothing was too much trouble.  The chamomile tea is a must. I was sorry to leave and will be staying whenever I return to London.   "
October 2023,It Takes One To Know One:  SUPER!,"I stayed at the Milestone for 6 nights in October 2023 with relatives.  My family is in the hotel business in the U.K., so I can sense a quality establishment within about 90 seconds of walking in the front door.  This hotel and its offerings:  from rooms to cuisine is superb.  Mr. A. Pike, G.M., has one of the most professional, yet warm, staffs whom I have ever encountered.  I am going to miss some names, here, and I apologize in-advance; but shout-outs to:  Tim, Andrei, and Fran at the front; Sophia in the executive office; Messrs. Ahuja and Fraser, Managers; Chakira, Aurela, & Zen, Reception; Leo & Paolo, Dining Room Mgrs. extraordinaire; Dorina & Denis--the wonderful ambassadors of breakfast.  When one works in the hospitality industry, you don't forget names, as you can…"
October 2023,Far exceeded expectations!,"Our stay at the Milestone Hotel in Kensington far exceeded our expectations.  My husband and I came to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  Every member of the staff was unfailingly friendly, welcoming, and helpful.  Our room was extremely comfortable, and I especially appreciated the delicious clotted cream fudge that was frequently left during turndown service, one of many thoughtful and welcoming gestures. The housekeeping staff did a fantastic job, our room was immaculate.  I enjoyed staying at the Milestone possibly more than any hotel I have visited.  We hated to leave."
October 2023,The best of authentic London,"There are so many nice new hotels in London so the Milestone is easily overlooked. We chose it because we like interesting and unique over fancy and this one hits the right spot. It is quintessential British luxury and not just international hotel standard luxury. We have stayed here before and each time was satisfactory so we chose it again for our three week grand European trip. For frequent travelers to London, the location is ideal as you feel like you are in a more real part of London. Knightsbridge, Mayfair and Picadilly are for tourists, but those of us who know London enough love the Kensington area.  The hotel is quirky but exceedingly tasteful. You will definitely not forget it. It also has this very authentic London charm with its narrow corridors, dark nooks and…"
October 2023,A true gem right on the High Street,"Beautiful room in a perfect location across from Kensington Park. Staff were all incredibly helpful, down to the smallest detail.  Two blocks from the Royal Albert Hall.  Though located on the High Street, rooms were very quiet.  Would certainly stay here again."
September 2023,Royal Experience,Our stay was beyond our expectations. The staff were so very kind and thoughtful. Everything was very personalized. Coffee service in our room. Breakfast was perfection. Ate in their bar/pub and was gorgeous. Dinner was amazing. Never experienced this type of gracious accommodations. Highly recommended. 
November 2022,Fabulous hotel and staff,"Amazing hotel and staff .. everyone was so lovely. Couldn’t fault It from start to finish. Clean, beautiful and had everything we required for are stay in London  We will definitely be back and will recommend it to friends and family. Very good location."
November 2022,An Absolute London Delight,"Wonderfully charming cozy English hotel with a staff that is thoroughly helpful, friendly, and professional in every way.  Luxurious, not in grandeur, nor opulence (although the hotel is beautifully finished) but in gracious, sincere hospitality where you are charmed and delighted to be here at the start and end of everyday.   I can think of very few hotels in the world,  where my wife and I share these words every time we check in “it’s good to be back”."
June 2022,A true home away from home,"What can I say about this hotel when everything is perfection. The staff become family and take care of their guests with utmost care and professionalism. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed. Howe keeping does a wonderful job, turn down service is a joy to come back to. We enjoyed breakfast daily, had a great afternoon experience and dinner on a couple of evenings I will not stay anywhere else when I visit London"
November 2022,Charming Hotel and Staff,"We love staying at The Milestone when we're in London.  The entire staff is charming and so kind.  When they say, ""Welcome Home!"" when you return each day, it's just the nicest thing because they seem so sincere.  Every interaction we had from the front desk staff, bartenders, concierge and cleaning staff was exceptional.  The hotel is across the street from Kensington Park and close to all sorts of shopping and restaurants--there's not a better location in all of London.  We love everything about this property and can't wait to return."
September 2022,The best location and service in London!,"The Milestone is a beautiful boutique hotel steps away from Hyde Park, Kensington Palace and a beautiful stroll to Buckingham Palace and a convenient Underground station. But you will want to spend as much time as possible in the Milestone itself. The rooms are decorated with lush fabrics and have incredible bathrooms. The Stable's Bar, The Park lounge and Cheneston's are all superbly decorated and serve delicious and creative drinks and food. The best part of your stay will be meeting and talking with the staff that are helpful and attentive."
November 2022,A hidden gem!,"This hotel was recommended by a friend who had described it as a hidden gem.  He was absolutely correct! it's a terrific location with great staff, everyone was welcoming and super helpful and engaging.  My room (106) was gorgeous, beautifully appointed with lots of lovely features. The stables Bar is very reminiscent of Ralph Lauren, cosy and intimate staffed by a super team who could not do enough for me. All in all a brilliant recommendation!"
November 2022,A wonderful stay at The Milestone,"An absolutely fantastic stay at The Milestone! The hotel itself was beautiful and there was very clear attention given to each and every detail. The room was spacious and very comfortable. I would have to say my favorite space in the hotel was the conservatory, decorated beautifully and you can’t beat the natural light.   I will say what really set the hotel apart was the staff. Every person I came into contact with was exceptionally and went out of their way to be helpful. It really was a huge value add and made me feel right at home."
November 2022,Hidden Gem,"Classic, boutique hotel with an old world charm and attention to detail that I a hidden gem in London. Superb location right by Hyde Park and the shopping district in Kensington Highstreet. Delicious highteas. The perfect gift for a birthday. Highly recommend as a getaway."
October 2022,Quintessential English Hotel,"The quintessential traditional London experience.   We had a superar stay.  The staff are excellent throughout the property:   Reception, Concierge, Housekeeping, Bar and Restaurant staff were all friendly, attentive and professional.  We continued our trip at two other properties and the difference in service was considerable.  The property itself is well appointed and well kept, providing a fantastic view to traditional London hotel quarters.  This time we opted for a suite and stayed at the Venetian Suite.  Very posh, spacious, comfortable, and traditional with modern high quality amenities.  High Tea, drinks and food were also a 10 out of 10.  The only downside to staying at the Milestone is eventually checking out and leaving.  A memorable stay."
October 2022,"Genteel, luxurious hotel in a great location","The Milestone is a lovely, Victorian-style hotel that goes above and beyond to serve its guests. There is an abundance of staff ready to fulfill every whim. The beds are comfortable, and the food is good. That said, our bedroom was a little small and the bathroom a little large. The bathroom was  1/3 the size of the bedroom."
April 2023,Cant wait to go back!,From start to finish our experience was first class!   The staff could not do enough to ensure your stay was memorable 10/10 we will definitely be back.  Location was also very good with great transport links.
April 2023,Great Experience and Service,I had a wonderful experience at The Milestone Hotel and Residences at my first trip to London. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel is very clean. I also had a nice experience dinning in. It is near a train station and one of the Royal gardens. I would definitely recommend to stay at The Milestone Hotel. 
April 2023,One of the best in London,"Absolutely nothing negative to say about this property. Great friendly and attentive staff, fantastic breakfast menu, amazing location. Comfortable and quiet rooms. We were in the King deluxe room for 5 nights which offered daily bottled water, turn down service and a welcome gift . Would highly recommend this hotel "
April 2023,Our 2nd home in London,"We consider this Hotel our 2nd home when we come to London, since all services provided have always been excellent.  The staff are always helpful and friendly ready with a smile and have an eye for detail.  "
April 2023,Top shelf hotel,"We have traveled to London many times and this was absolutely the nicest hotel we have ever stayed at there.  From the moment we were greeted at the front door, given a tour and shown to our rooms the service was outstanding.  The hotel is beautiful and historic with a fabulous bar.  Located in the Kensington neighborhood meant an easy walk to so many good restaurants and easy access to the tube.  We were sorry to leave and look forward to our next visit there."
July 2023,Perfect,"Superb in every way . Food and drink and attention to detail was amongst the very best . Every member of staff made the effort and did it with a warmth and a level of engagement that I have rarely experienced elsewhere .  Beautiful building , beautifully furnished .  Couldn’t find a hole to pick even if I wanted to …… perfect"
July 2023,One of the best!,"The hotel staff and attention to detail exceeds expectations. This hotel was recommended by our travel agent and we had the best experience. The furnishings and decor are exquisite. From our wake up call followed immediately by our choice of coffees delivered to our room each morning,  truly a first class experience. The breakfast was delicious each morning in a beautifully appointed, intimate dining room. Truly one of the best hotels we’ve stayed at in our travels over the years."
June 2023,MILESTONE HOTEL - THE HOTEL THAT CARES!!!!!!!,"The bathroom was simply beautiful and our room was amazing thanks, we've never stayed in a hotel that goes so far out of its way to help you, nothing was ever too much trouble or too much of an inconvenience for the staff and I'm in a wheelchair.   When it came time for us to leave, we asked for taxi numbers but they had someone go outside and hail a cab for us.  WE FELT LIKE ROYALTY AND WERE TREATED AS IF WE REALLY ARE ROYALTY FOR OUR ENTIRE STAY!!!!!!!!!!  MILESTONE HOTEL 🏨 WE WILL DEFINITELY BE COMING BACK!!!!!!!"
June 2023,Great place to stay in London,"The Milestone Hotel experience was excellent for myself and my family. The staff was very attentive to our needs, and no request went unanswered.  Breakfast was an event every morning and we enjoyed it immensely. It began our day like the sunshine we experienced for our nine days we stayed there. My grandson loved the pool, the afternoon tea and the Stable bar with the delicious hot chocolate, served with his favorite cookies. He adored the doorman, Tim, whom gave him special attention. This hotel was one of the best I have ever stayed at and we enjoyed our time. "
June 2023,Best hotel in London,"A pretty well located Hotel with all the english flavor! As soon as you wake up you can take a stroll in hyde park, or look for an event to attend at the Royal Albert Hall which is just a 5 minutes  walk from the Milestone All the staff is very amicable and helfull. "
June 2023,Exceptional Boutique Hotel Opposite Kensington Gardens,"The Milestone is an excellent boutique hotel in the heart of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea just opposite Kensington Gardens with the most delightful and guest oriented staff, beautiful and thoughtful guest rooms and bathrooms. Walkable to great attractions, shops, and dining. Would come back in a heartbeat!! "
June 2023,Fabulous Staff,"We are regular to London and have stayed in some fab places but the staff here in this boutique hotel make your stay so memorable and worthwhile you wouldn’t want to stay anywhere else, everyone you meet is just so helpful and kind, the service is impeccable, thank you for having us recently for an overnight stay, from the doorman Tim, the pleasant concierge team, the reception staff, the restaurant team, the bar tender and lovely waitress’ just everyone including housekeeping are just so kind, we loved everything about it apart from the size of our bed but I guess this comes with the booking of the room,  booking.com where cheaper than booking direct which we much prefer to do but it’s worth calling the hotel directly to book in, we will be back …"
June 2023,Best hotel in London,"My wife and I stayed for 1 night at this fabulous hotel to celebrate my birthday. What a treat it was! Everything was perfect, lovely room, lovely bathroom with the BEST shower and bathroom products, the most delicious breakfast and most of all the incredible staff. Everyone made us feel so welcome and valued. Nothing was too much trouble and all done with the perfect balance of friendliness and professionalism. It’s not the cheapest place you’ll ever stay at but I urge you to make an occasion of it and book a night there; hang the expense and enjoy it!! We will definitely be back."
May 2023,British Luxury,Enjoyed our four day stay here. The Hotel offers a convenient location with impeccable service. The afternoon tea service was wonderful. The English Breakfast served daily was delicious. The evening turndown service was the highlight.
May 2023,Exceptional Service and Support at the Milestone Hotel in London!,"We had a lovely stay at this wonderful boutique hotel in the Kensington area of London. We appreciated the fine service and support from the stellar staff at the Milestone.  Location was ideal and breakfast was divine!  We also enjoyed tea in their sunroom, drinks in their famous bar and fine dining in their restaurant.  This was certainly a trip and vacation to remember made all the better by truly exceptional people working at the Milestone including Grant, Beliz, Renato, Joe, Dino, Mohammed and Mansour.  Thank you."
April 2023,Milestone experience,"The Milestone is a beautiful, small hotel that is conveniently located in London and has superb service, including an outstanding restaurant. Afternoon tea with grandchildren was delightful. We strongly recommend this hotel!"
April 2023,An excellent hotel,"Our stay here was excellent.  From the moment we arrived, the staff were welcoming, knowledgeable and helpful with our questions and needs.  We will stay here each time we are in London.  One evening, we were planning to walk to a recommended restaurant.  We asked about directions and the concierge walked with us to the restaurant.  This is a beautiful, well-run, comfortable hotel.  We highly recommend it."
February 2023,Not worth the money,The reviews of this hotel sounded amazing! We thought we would treat ourselves at the end of our Europe trip and book this hotel for three nights.  We got to our room and it was tiny! Wayyyy too much furniture for a hotel room! Definitely not needed. We had no room to open our suitcases. There was no view and it only had a double bed. We asked to be upgraded to a bigger room which swiftly happened. The next room had a much bigger bed and view of the park. (Still too much chunky furniture and no room for luggage) We could have stayed at a major hotel chain with bigger and better facilities for a much cheaper price. Upon checking out the bill said it charged 15 pounds a day for tips! We asked for this to be removed.  There is no coffee machine in the rooms  No mini bar  Not worth…
January 2023,Great hotel with friendly staff,"Have been to the Milestone many times. Returned once again in January 2023 and we had, again, a lovely experience. Great service, lovely friendly staff, charming view from our lovely room with all mod cons. Lovely breakfast room, great location. Will be back. "
April 2023,Almost Speechless,"My stay here at the Milestone was above and beyond anything I could have dreamed of. I'm almost left speechless at how wonderfully we were treated and how incredible the accommodations were. The building itself is impeccably decorated and transports you back to Victorian era London. The breakfasts were divine- smoked salmon eggs benedict every day please! The location was perfect, just across from Kensington Palace and beautiful Hyde Park. I can't recommend this hotel enough, and I'm already planning my next stay there! And a special thank you to Andrew and all of the other staff that helped make my trip a dream come true<3"
February 2023,Exquisite 8 course tasting menu in Cheneston’s Restaurant,At a recommendation from my brother in law we decided to give the Milestone a go for dinner.   We arrived early for our reservation and had a drink in the Stables Bar. Lilo was a terrific host and very hospitable and we tried the smoked old fashioned which is a must try!  Paolo the restaurant manager came through to introduce himself which we thought was a very personal touch. Him and the team looked after us and recommended we tried the new tasting menu that had recently launched.   We were blown away by the quality of the food and the attentive service. A hidden gem found right on our doorstep.
February 2023,Disappointing return visit..,"Recently returned from a 3 night family staycation to celebrate a big 40th Birthday. We were so excited to return to The Milestone Hotel after being blown away by our initial visit last year. Disappointingly, there were no bells and whistles to speak of at check-in this time, no offer of a welcome drink etc.. The receptionist didn't reference that we were return customers, instead she repeatedly apologised for the slow computer system when trying to authorise our credit card for incidentals. It was disappointing not to get that home from home welcome that we'd been so looking forward to since booking this stay last year!   After check-in was completed we made our way into the lounge area for our champagne afternoon tea reservation. Unfortunately, the cold and impersonal…"
February 2023,5 STAR HOTEL AND SERVICE,Myself and my partner recently had a night in London and decided to book this beautiful hotel due to the close proximity to the royal albert hall. The hotel and service was immaculate from start to finish. The staff really go above and beyond to make your stay memorable. I loved the quirky old english style to this hotel and the room was just breathtaking. Thank you so much for an amazing stay. Hope to visit again in the future
February 2023,The best hotel stay ever,"My wife and I traveled with our 18 year old son to London for the first time and were warmly greeted by the front desk staff and night manager, who offered a host of valuable recommendations for our stay. Our junior sweet room was lovely and beautifully appointed, with excellent, comfortable bedding. The hotel ambience was exactly what we had hoped for, the food was delicious, the service was exceptional . I could not recommend a hotel more highly and our family is already scheming to find a way to return in the near future. "
January 2023,Favorite Hotel in London!,"The first thing you’ll notice upon arriving at this beautiful hotel is the excellent service and generous staff. We were fortunate enough to stay at The Milestone Hotel for the first half of our honeymoon trip and truly enjoyed our stay. Our room was quiet and quaint, and we had a beautiful view facing Kensington Gardens. The staff also helped us celebrate the occasion by gifting us flowers and other surprises. It was a wonderful and unique experience.   We thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast services & morning teas at The Milestone and always looked forward to a nightcap in the beautiful parlor and bar. The staff was so kind and friendly - and it was a pleasure getting to know everyone. On top of everything, it served as the most perfect location for all of our daytime activities…"
February 2023,Best hotel in London,"The first thing you'll notice on arriving is that the service is uniformly excellent - warm, helpful and thoughtful. The hotel itself is also beautiful, with clear attention to detail throughout. The rooms are wonderful and all have their own distinct character; the food is great; and no visit is complete without going to the fabulous Stables bar, which has a truly imaginative drinks list curated by award-winning bartenders! I would never stay anywhere else in London."
January 2023,friendly and beautiful Hotel.,The hotel was beautiful and the area where it was situated was perfect - just a short walk to the Royal Albert Hall.  The rooms were so quaint and beautifully decorated.  The bed was comfortable and very cosy. The service was wonderful from reception to turn down staff.  Everyone was so friendly and pleasant and let us know where everything was.  Breakfast was beautiful with a good range of different options on the menu.
January 2023,Outstanding London vacation,"From the moment the bellman welcomed us by name to the moment we were wished a safe trip home, the experience of staying at The Milestone was simply an awesome experience.  Words can not clearly explain the feeling of hospitality each and every member of Mr. Pike's staff extends to their guests. We have stayed in many beautiful hotels in London and around the world. The Milestone is at the top of our list - we have already made plans for next post-Christmas holiday. The residence we stayed in was perfect for our family- it was a joy to sit in the living room with the fireplace going while we enjoyed room service and a delicious pot of tea. You truly want to stay there all day. The front desk was most hospitable. I can not thank all of the concierges for their courteous and…"
January 2023,Another Trip To London,"The Milestone is like going to a families house. This was our second time staying here & of course the service is 5 star and above. The staff was outstanding I surprised my wife with flying my daughter and son in law over for here birthday and the staff was great at helping me plan it and keep it a secret. A couple people I would like to give a shout out to. Joe from concierge, Tom the first office manger, the ladies and gentleman in the dinner room and the ladies at the front desk where all superb. This hotel maintains a level of British hospitality that is hard to beat. Until next time!"
January 2023,Why Go Anywhere Else?,"We have stayed at the Milestone Hotel numerous times but this was our first stay post-COVID.  I was concerned that the Milestone's standards of elegance and first class service would have suffered since the pandemic.  But to my delight, the hotel remains the same wonderful hotel that I remembered!  The staff is only too eager to assist with any plans--even before arrival.  Dino, the concierge, made our dinner reservations for us a week before our arrival!  Grant, the server/manager of the breakfast rooms, got us off to a terrific start with hearty breakfasts and sound advice.  Spencer and Steven made sure we had plenty of bottled water and taxis to drive us around.  There are many hotel choices in London, but why not stay in a truly British hotel with impeccable service and…"
May 2022,Overall satisfaction.,We felt you were totally taking care of us.  At no time did we fell we were alone.  We were to leave several days ago but because of our exposure to  Covid we were not able to return to the US.  Now we can we are almost saddened.  We will return.   Thank you.
May 2022,Ann Forkey,"I have just found my new favorite hotel in London! The “Milestone Hotel and Residences” in Kensington was wonderful. From beginning to end everything was perfect- the location was phenomenal (being located directly across from Kensington Garden and Palace), the interiors were exquisite and the food was delicious, but most important was the service. The staff were a very friendly well trained group of professionals who made me feel like I was at home.  I absolutely loved staying there and can’t wait to come back again soon. I can’t thank them enough for making me feel safe and sound at their beautiful hotel!"
May 2022,Tea time,Wonderfull place nice workers delicious pastries and generous quantities  They even suggested a take away bag because we couldn’t finish all the dishes They offer skones also home made It’s also well placed I totally recommend 💯
April 2022,Rooms matters,"We stayed in a deluxe queen. When we first arrived we were given a room with a small ""queen bed"". The first room to us was really small and the bed seemed the size of two twin beds. We would have really regretted our stay. That is why I'm rating the rooms average. The first room we had should be for single travelers or a different category. We asked to move and luckily there was a room available in the ""same"" category. It made all the difference not only was the bed bigger but also the room itself. Beyond that the staff were helpful, responsive, and friendly. The warm breakfast was great. The hotel is in a nice area by stores, shopping, and restaurants. It felt safe to walk around and close to the subway. The hotel is nicely styled. Not large and grand more of a boutique feel.…"
April 2022,Just wonderful,"My wife and I were celebration our 45th anniversary in London and we chose to stay at the Milestone based upon out sons and daughters-in-laws recommendation.  The Milestone was everything we could have expected and more.  Everything was just perfect from the time we arrived until the time we departed.  It is a great location, private enough yet accessible to everything.  I cannot say enough about the staff, the entire staff, from doorperson, to front desk, to concierge, to dining room, to bar tender, to household staff.  Friendly, open honest, more there to be your partner and facilitator rather than servant.     Mt wife coordinated with Jose (concierge) and Jose organized our entire trip itinerary, no small task, especially since this was our first trip to London.  We had out…"
April 2022,Fabulous for people and pets,"The Milestone met all the requirements you would expect for human guests. The staff were polite and attentive. The room was exceptionally comfortable - we had a suite which had a two seater sofa, two chairs, a small table, a window seat, a desk and office style chair. It was all very well appointed, and the included breakfast was lovely.   We also took our dog, who is anxious and a little stand-offish with people. When The Milestone say they are ""pet friendly"", they're not exaggerating. We had to notify the hotel in advance (as you might expect) that we were bringing a dog, and there was an extra ""pet deposit"" to pay, which isn't a surprise.   Some hotels will put guests in shabbier rooms if they are bringing a dog, but that wasn't the case here at all. Our room was furnished…"
April 2022,One of the best hotels in which I have ever been,"The hotel is extremely cosy. The overall structure is elegant & takes you behind in the Victorian age.  The staff is extremely warmful: they made us feeling as at home (or better).  The quality of the breakfast is extremely high, as well as the service at the tables."
April 2022,Home from Home,"Just a lovely place to stay, very friendly and welcoming but highly professional staff at every turn. The hotel is in a nice location, just across the road from Hyde Park and very near Kensington Palace. The Royal Albert Hall is a short walk up the road from the hotel. The restaurant, bar and conservatory are great places to relax and enjoy food and drink and the service is simply exceptional."
April 2022,Iconic and practical,"The Milestone is both luxurious and cozy. The staff is helpful, warm, and made every detail of my stay perfect. I was in London on a solo vacation and staying at the Milestone felt like coming home! The dining areas are especially gorgeous and will instantly make you feel like you have done London right. I look forward to bringing my family to the Milestone next time! The smoked salmon at breakfast was the best smoked salmon I’ve ever had - and I’m a New Yorker so I’m picky. The concierge Fran helped me mail an important package on my last day there and it was such a relief to have his help. Absolutely five stars."
April 2022,Perfect Hotel & Perfect Location,"Faultless Visit- sheer detail made it a perfect trip to the capital. Super impressed with the staff who went above and beyond to ensure we were well looked after. Champagne on arrival, chocolates, homemade cookies, and the most wonderful Doorman (Steve) who made our trip even more special with the added kindness that was never expected.  Olivia on reception also deserves a special mention as she was so welcoming and friendly and made the checking in process smooth and efficient.   Thankyou for a wonderful stay for my Hubby’s 30th. We will be back and wouldn’t dream of staying anywhere else when in London!   10/10- breakfast too!   Many Thanks- Holly & Lawrence Carter"
April 2022,"Elegant Oasis, in London","We stayed at The Milestone for a week. The doorman (James) made our stay feel like we were at home---he quickly learned our name,  offered great local travel advice, and always welcomed us back to the hotel. The bar is cozy, the restaurant great food....The service people overall were very attentive and helpful. Seemed like everyone was ready to help with anything, yet never intrusive. I would STRONGLY RECCOMEND."
March 2022,Long weekend stay for wife and her sister,"I used to live 10 metres down the road from the Milestone, in Kensington Court, and popped in a number of times for a meal or afternoon tea. I booked my wife and her sister 2 nights there for a weekend escape to London from Finland and they loved it. Fantastic period property, gorgeous interiors, excellent service - and of course the location is splendid for being in the heart of RBKC."
April 2022,An excellent stay,"Wow! What a find. We stayed at The Milestone as we were attending a concert at the Royal Albert Hall.   Generally we tend to stay in larger hotels when in London so all the facilities and services are at hand.  Well The Milestone offered every facility you could possibly need and more.  What sets The Milestone apart is the highly trained staff who not only seem to anticipate your every need but do so with a smile, humour and a lot of personality. Stephen, the doorman sets the scene but every one we met was friendly, kind and caring, especially to our parents who joined us on this stay. And a shout out for the people who also maintain great standards including housekeeping and great cooking.   Our room, although I thought on the small side, had every possible amenity. The bed was…"
April 2022,Afternoon tea,"We went to The Milestone for afternoon tea on Sunday and had the most superb experience. The staff were simply fantastic and were so kind and welcoming, as well as attentive to us, and especially to my children, whose birthday tea it was. They made it such an incredible experience, suggesting the girls tried various teas as well as bringing out an extra treat in honour of their birthday, and they absolutely loved it. Everyone we met during our short visit from the super waiting staff to the doorman and concierge, was very kind, professional and friendly. We would highly recommend the hotel for afternoon tea."
March 2022,The Milestone is a Gem,"It was like stepping into a storybook as we enjoyed our time in the delightfully classic Milestone Hotel.  The rooms, the lobby, the amazing staff, High Tea .. all was amazing .. My wife kept calling it the “Mary Poppins” hotel. I cannot recommend it more - they  even arranged for us to get our Covid-19 pre-departure test for our flight home.  The Doorman was a delight (Steven) and Fran the concierge .. all of them .. top rate .. there for you to make your stay amazing.   When you are in London .. stay at the Milestone!"
March 2022,Nikah blessing and dinner,"Thank you to the amazing Leo Forte and his colleagues for the most incredible service on Saturday. We had booked for a Nikah blessing conducted by our Imam, followed by a small champagne reception and dinner for eight - we booked the Oratory room, which was the building’s original chapel. Now a gem of a dining and ceremony room - wood panelling and plenty of original features.  This truly was one of the best customer service experiences I have ever had. Everything was of the highest standard, everyone was so professional yet incredibly friendly. And all so patient and flexible - from the timings, to our niece ordering her fifth mango juice of the evening :)  It was the most special day for us and our family - the memories will last a lifetime.   I can’t recommend this hotel…"
March 2022,Wonderful hotel on a top location,The hotel is all in English style. Very nice decor. With modern comfort. The super staff made us feel very much at home. We had a room with a view on Kensington Palace and park. Even had 2 bathrooms for the 2 of us. It was very comfortable an clean. Cannot think of beter place to stay at this side of London. We would very much like to come back.
March 2022,Mrs Karen Cairns,"Absolutely wonderful, the staff are so friendly, very attentive and nothing’s a problem. Highly recommended,  Great location. The room bright and airy with all mod cons and a lovely turn down service. Breakfast awesome and set us up for the day Will now be our go to hotel when staying in London"
March 2022,Going back in time….,"We spend two nights at this old style, traditional hotel. The first impression was a bit of a disappointment with a relatively small room but during our stay the place grew on us. Staff was friendly.  Considering the small number of rooms (43) there is a really nice gym. Unfortunately, you had to book as only 1 person was allowed there at a time due to Covid. Was a bit of a nuisance that you had to plan when to go but I assume it will change again.  There was a nice restaurant area serving breakfast with a big variety, for both the continental and hot breakfast. The hot breakfast was a huge disappointment as the food was not freshly made but was reheated. Day 2 we opted for the continental which was much better (recommendable)."
March 2022,The most wonderful stay!,"Celebrating my 50th birthday with my sister as well as Mother’s Day! The whole team were so kind and welcoming and could not do enough for you. They made us feel so special and at home.  The minute we arrived in the taxi and Steve said ‘Welcome Home’, we just knew it was going to be a wonderful stay.  Everything from the quality of the food, the Noel Coward Suite (with the most fabulous bathroom and views), to the reception, concierge, bar and restaurant staff. Finished the weekend with a gorgeous lunch in The Oratory which was a complete surprise!  Andrew; you have a gorgeous hotel and must be so proud of your fantastic team! We did not want to leave and are missing Steve’s great sense of humour already. Cannot wait to come back! Thank you so much. Lisa and Tina x"
February 2022,Home away from home,"Myself and my husband had a delightful stay at milestones. Nothing was too much trouble. Room was very comfortable and had a fantastic night sleep. Lovely view over Kensington palace. We had breakfast at the hotel and there was plenty of choice and was cooked very well. All the staff in the hotel were extremely friendly and attentive. Would recommend and would certainly stay again. Hotel was in great location for Kensington palace, Albert hall, South Kensington and harrods."
February 2022,The best service we’ve ever had,"My partner and I have have stayed in many hotels across London and  we can honestly say that this by far the best hotel we’ve visited. This is almost entirely down to the quality of service and the quality of the team, who are second to none. Worth every penny and we will be back as soon as possible."
February 2022,5* Experience,"This was my second stay at the Milestone and it certainly did not disappoint. I stayed for 2 nights in November 2021 and am already keen to go back. The charm and grace of the hotel is second to none. The staff are warm, friendly,welcoming,professional and nothing is too much trouble. The Afternoon tea with bubbles was tremendous, my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I opted for a romantic turn down service one evening, it wasnt as good as I was hoping as there was a bottle of Champagne, 2 chocolates and a floating candle, in fact my husband didn't even notice anything different but I did book it last minute so I blame myself. It hasnt put me off opting for the service again. I'm hoping to return in February and am so looking forward to my next visit."
November 2021,Luxurious and Homely Yuletide 5* Experince,"The Milestone indulgent luxury afternoon tea (with bubbles of course) has been the opening scene to our Christmas celebrations for many years. Superbly olde English in style, elegance and family warmth, there is nowhere else quite like it! The quality of patisserie and service excellence, that is both warm and efficient (not robotic like some 5 star venues), is of the highest standard. We will be returning 2022 of course!"
December 2021,Doesn’t get any better ANYWHERE!,"Remains my favorite hotel in the world. The unique charm cannot be duplicated.  What impresses me most each visit is the difference the staff make in my stay. Starting with the GM, Andrew Pike, the service is impeccable and all his team make you feel part of the family.  As I’ve traveled the world for business and leisure there is only one Milestone and it’s greatness has me planning my travels around being a guest!"
December 2021,Long Overdue,"Andrew & Staff  Here I sit on Christmas morning of 2021 and all I can think about is the two Christmases that my Wife and I have missed not being in London and especially spending them at The Milestone. I want to thank you for the memories that you and your staff have given us. I can honestly say the Milestone is truly at the top of its game. From arrival to departure the service is flawless. The amazing atmosphere created by staff during the holidays is brilliant. Our meal on Christmas evening in the Cheneston’s Restaurant 2019, was simply superb. Kudos to your chef. As we close yet on another year of uncertainties, our hopes and hearts look to traveling once again. Cheers to 2022 and hopefully another Holiday dream come true at, The Milestone!     With kind regards, Steve and…"
December 2021,Christmas Came early for us!,"I was hoping to keep this 5 star property the best kept secret in London!   I have reviewed dozens of hotels and restaurants in London over the last 25 years, but I cannot remember when I thought an experience was so deserving of an excellent review!  Having been recommended by some friends to stay at the property we booked two rooms for our Christmas shopping weekend, upon arrival at the Steve greeted us with a warm welcome, this warm welcome continued at our check in desk with Aurelle, our luggage was immediately taken to our to exquisitely appointed rooms, this property has the boutique feel of opulence which has been lost in the more well known 5 start hotels in central London, I certainly have paid considerably more for far less quality,style, and service at other…"
December 2021,This is rare praise - Staff was truly outstanding and property embodied classic British ambience,"I am truly feeling privileged to write such a glowing review. Its rare, as I travel globally and often, so this is really saying something. My colleague and I were in London for a week of meetings and incredibly busy.  The staff - great personalities, remembered our names after the first day, helped us with anything we needed. I could name many of them but then I would have a long list! What surprised me was the true feeling of caring - I know this may sound odd but this team did not make us feel like they were working at a job. They made us feel as though they were happy with what they were doing and each individual was a professional and bent over backwards to make sure every detail of our stay was catered to. Do I need to tell you that is so very rare these days? So kudos to…"
December 2021,Deserves more than 5 stars!,"Excellent customer service from all staff, Nutten, Fran and Mansour were great. Very attentive, helpful , friendly and at our service. Nutten showed us several rooms before my wife agreed to one. They allowed early check in snd late check out. Overall anazing ghrought!"
December 2021,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful service, just right for an anniversary trip","First, I have to confess that this is the only hotel that I've ever stayed in in London, so I can't compare to other options, but it was a perfect experience so I can't imagine how any other hotel could beat it.  From the very first moment, every staff member was extremely courteous and helpful. Just very sweet people who seemed to like each other a lot. My wife were in London for our 25th wedding anniversary, so the friendly, caring environment was greatly appreciated.  The room was beautiful, the bed was extremely comfortable (firm but not too firm), and it was quaint, but large enough to feel roomy. The walls had fabric stretched about 1/4"" from the wall...I don't know if that's a typical English thing or not, but it really gave the room a luxurious feel.  We had breakfast in…"
December 2021,Milestone,"I had a wonderful and unforgettable time at the Milestone. The hotel is elegant; I loved learning about the history of the place. The staff were so kind and attentive, tea time is a must, and the view is beautiful. I cannot wait to go again!"
March 2022,Victoria P,"I had the privilege of staying at The Milestone Hotel this past week. To be frank, this is the best hotel I have ever stayed at. The staff are extremely accommodating, and go out of there way to help their guests. In addition to this, the hotel is absolutely breathtaking. I cannot express how wonderful my stay was at The Milestone, and look forward to coming back!"
March 2022,Exceeded very high expectations,"I have walked past this hotel many times and always wanted to stay there. Often this leads to disappointment. But I’m glad to say that we felt the warm welcome as soon as we stepped through the doors. The staff were wonderful. Friendly, professional and attentive. The glass of complimentary champagne was a lovely surprise  The room (free upgrade) was extremely comfortable and spotlessly clean. The bar was inviting. Cosy and welcoming and I could have watched Lilo making cocktails and smoking whiskey all night.  We will definitely be coming back! Can’t recommend enough."
March 2022,A Wonderful Anniversary weekend,"It was several years since we last stayed at the Milestone and this trip has reminded us of what we have been missing. We could not have been welcomed more warmly, the staff have all been exceptional and the whole place is traditionally elegant and classy.  A wonderful anniversary weekend and hopefully we will be back again this time next year!"
March 2022,Amazing place,"loved this hotel, you feel completely comfortable,  they cant do enough for you and it really feels like a happy team.   We had both dinner and breakfast here, again it was lovely the chef goes above and beyond and you can taste he/she looks their work."
March 2022,A home from home,I have been visiting the Milestone Hotel for some years now and every time I arrive and get that warm friendly greeting I know I have arrived at what I now call my home from home. Service is always warm but discreet you are always made to feel welcome and nothing is too much. Accommodation is excellent and it is in a wonderful location. Food is always good whatever you decide on and a good wine cellar is on hand too. My husband and I just love it at the Milestone.
March 2022,Quintessentially British Home from Home. A pure Delight!,"I truly felt that this was a quintessentially British Home from Home.  It was a wonderfully RELAXING first visit to you.   The Spa facilities were great and a lovely treat not usually found in Boutique London hotel.   Angelo in the Bar was fun and attentive.   Your Team are a credit to the Hotel, and couldn't do enough for me - they made me feel very special,  as if I was the only one at your Hotel.   I'm so pleased I chose to stay with you, and am very much looking forward to my stay at Rubens next month, now I know it's part of the Red Carnations Brand."
February 2022,Wonderful Experience,"My wife for for my birthday 2020 got me tickets to see a show in London weekend of 05/02. We wanted to stay in London and the company i work for have done work over the years for Red Carnation Hotels, so we decided why not try the Milestone.   From the moment we walked in we felt at home. We was welcomed in by the concierge who directed us to the desk and to Arella, who was absolutely wonderful in her approach and level of service. She was so courteous to ask what we were up to and gave recommendations on places to eat and also said if we needed any restaurants booked that they would be happy to book on our behalf.   She showed us to our room, showed us everything and even arranged some drinks to be brought up to our room. We then returned from our walk about and early evening…"
February 2022,It is rare when your expectations which may already  be high are completely exceeded.,"Family trip that had been put off for  18 months due to covid and finally made it to London. Used to live in London and have been back many times since moving back to the states.Have stayed at many hotels in London for pleasure and work but this was first time at The Milestone. The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful from booking to concierge, front desk, restaurant and barmen. The rooms are quite nice--better than portrayed in the photos; well decorated clean comfortable and view of the park was stunning. We looked forward to coming back to the hotel after days out for a nice drink in the bar. It was like coming home. Absolutely loved this hotel."
February 2022,"Elegant and charming, with a warm welcome","A well apointed bedroom with views over the Park, nicely decorated with an air of sophistication, matched by all the principle reception rooms. The staff couldn't have been more helpful and the hand written welcome note from the manager Andrew Pike was a lovely touch. Class."
December 2021,Delightful lunch,"Had the most wonderful lunch at the hotel. Everything about it was exquisite. The quality of the food was exceptional, the service absolutely top class and the ambiance was delightful. The Irish Coffee (which can be so hit and miss even in the vert best restaurants) was absolutely delicious. Highly recommend for a memorable experience. "
February 2022,"Absolutely superb , first class all round","Absolutely first class , have been here a few times now and every time they raise the bar , really wouldn’t go anywhere else now when I’m in London, super suite , very special service from all the staff, amazing cocktails, Just a really great experience all round, well done"
January 2022,Fabulous weekend away,"Me and a friend had a lovely weekend staying at the milestone. All the staff were absolutely wonderful and went out of there way to make you feel at home. Absolutely no request was to large for them. The rooms were decorated beautifully and ours had a great view over the Kensington gardens and the palace.   It is located very close to Kensington high street tube station, so very easy to get around. Lots of nice cafes and restaurants close by. We will definitely stay again. Thankyou"
January 2022,A Christmas to Remember,"We spent five days at The Milestone, our fourth visit to this unique hotel during these challenging Pandemic times, it is so convenient for the Royal Albert Hall.  All the staff at this hotel we have experienced are exceptionally efficient, friendly and very personable. I have stayed in many luxurious hotels around the world but the Milestone is now our firm favourite. Concerns that our Christmas Dinner may not be as indulgent as one would have at home,  were soon forgotten. Every meal was outstanding as was the service and entertainment, Carol singers Christmas Eve, a Harpist played during our Christmas dinner and even Santa made an appearance  bearing more gifts on this  memorable Christmas Day, for not just the kids. A truly exceptional hotel that has exceeded our…"
December 2021,Fab food and staff,"My friend and I went for afternoon tea here; the amount and quality of food was incredible - we couldn’t finish everything! But I’m mainly writing this review to thank the concierge Steve, he helped us park, had a laugh with us and made us feel so welcome. Thank you so much Steve, From the girls who struggled parking x"
December 2021,Lovely Hotel,"Re visited the Milestone as it was handy for the Royal Albert Hall. Remains one of the friendliest upmarket hotels in London. Very welcoming, with a glass of champagne on arrival. We had an unusual room heavily mirrored with a bathroom down a short flight of steps. Was interesting though perhaps not quite what I had expected. Very comfortable and we had a lovely stay. The bar remans cool but very traditional. My kind of place. Could have sat drinking cocktails all evening. Breakfast is exceptional. Overall it is a lovely hotel, one of my favourites in the capital."
February 2022,A charming hotel in the heart of Kensington,"What a wonderful hotel this was for our two night stay in London. We arrived early on Saturday at approximately 11:45 and were greeted by a very friendly receptionist (Heidi) who said our room was ready. We had the Princess Suite and were so impressed by everything. The decor was very tasteful and we loved the fact the hotel had gone to the trouble of organising a tiny dressing gown for a 8 month old. The breakfasts are plentiful and delicious and nothing is too much trouble. Likewise, we had a three course meal for one of the evenings and had some of the most delicious food we’d ever tasted. We hope to come back!"
February 2022,"Not so good in parts, overall though a nice stay. I would come again.","Try and keep this short. All in all, the hotel was a nice stay. Great little details are part of the stay. The interior is nice. They’re the odd flaws with decor, which I’ll add with photos. With 5 star the interior should be on point and you need to be hiring people who can do diy well. So not good in parts. The car service that’s part of the hotel, you have to prebook, which it doesn’t say that on the booklet in the hotel, so that needs to be corrected. The cocktail I had, wasn’t good. The guy behind the bar is poor at what he does. Not a good time as the bar at all, didn’t finish my drink and I just left. My partners was ok, but it was a simply gin and tonic, so how wrong can it go, the presentation could have been better. The service was very slow. The bar snacks came late…"
October 2021,A brilliant stay,"This was a short stay but thoroughly relaxing. The hotel is english mansion style (but in London) with outstanding service. Particular thank you to Angelo in the bar who was fantastic snd made some great recommendations.   The hotel thinks of everything, something I like. The staff are not fussy or overbearing but friendly and engaging. Despite spending only 24 hours here I came incredibly relaxed after a fairly stressful week.  Stayed in a studio room which I’d highly recommend. The room felt spacious and was very comfortable. I think the beds are savoir- they were very comfortable anyway! Needless to say the room was spotless and turndown was excellent.   The whole hotel is charming. If your definition of luxury is the very latest technology, a huge pool etc, this isn’t the…"
November 2021,Afternoon Tea was fantastic,"Visited The Milestone Hotel for Afternoon Tea with my mother. We had an absolutely fantastic time, the food was delicious and they were generous with their portions, we were so full we ended up taking some sweet treats home with us. We were served by Leo and Paulo and they were so welcoming and we felt extremely well looked after. Would recommend to everyone. Thank you all for a very special time."
October 2021,Amazing Hotel,"October 2021 my self & my partner stayed at the Milestone Hotel with four of our friends. The Staff are so good & very professional , the rooms we had were all 5 star, loved the bar small but so cosy. Fantastic Breakfast with great waitstaff.  This is without a doubt one of Londons best Hotels and I have stayed in a lot of London hotels so have some experience in selecting which are the best.  You wont go wrong at the Milestone, Kensington  Steve & Julie UK"
September 2021,Fantastic,"We were greeted by a very pleasant receptionist ,we were early so we were shown to the bar and given complimentary coffee and homemade biscuits. Our room was fabulous. We were there for 'A Night of Sparkling Enchantment' run by the hotel. It started with afternoon tea with a magician.To say the tea was amazing would be an understatement. Our chauffeur driven private visit to the Tower of London to see the Crown Jewels was a wonderful experience. We returned to the hotel for a beautiful meal accompanied by wines.The whole afternoon and evening was fantastic,we felt spoilt and special the whole time. Our room was lovely with a fantastic view of the park, it was luxurious. In the morning we had a good breakfast,there was great variety and it was good to be served not a buffet. Mr…"
July 2021,Overall wonderful stay....,"This is a very well located property in excellent condition even though its a bit older. The staff are friendly and helpful and the overall appearance is elegant. Our room suite was clean and comfortable.  There is no question that I would stay here again on our next visit to London throughly enjoyed our stay with yourselves, a special mention to Tara, John, Angelo, Pankaj and your wonderful housekeeping team.   An extremely well run and excellent establishment, well done to the management."
October 2021,Livia & Ataur Wedding Reception,"I had my wedding reception at this hotel and it was an amazing experience! All the staff are very friendly and helpful and Leo had everything in control, he made my wedding night absolutely smooth and perfect! The Windsor suite was decorated the way I dreamed. I will definitely celebrate here every year my wedding day and I can’t wait to try again the food prepared by Daniel, which was absolutely delicious!!"
October 2021,Ataur & Livia Wedding Reception,"This hotel and it’s staff are absolutely amazing, they could not be any more helpful, such lovely and very nice people, they made us feel like royalty. We celebrated our wedding reception here with family and friends and the experience thanks to the hotel was absolutely 5 star. I enjoyed Avery minute of and will be coming back every year to celebrate my anniversary here. Leo Forte was the best, he made us feel so comfortable and had everything under control. He went above and beyond with everything, from the welcome, to the food and the decorations, I honestly cannot praise him enough. Angelo was amazing with the Sabbrage and allowing me to try, a memory I will forever cherish. The food was amazing thanks to the chef Daniel and his team. This hotel has been the best I have been…"
October 2021,JimG,"Great find, small clean, amazing service. The Stables Bar hosted by Angelo made it a unique and pleasant visit. He loves making cocktails. Makes a Old Fashion using a unique blend of scotch and whiskey 🥃"
September 2021,Outstanding hotel with loads of English charm!,"We had a marvelous stay at The Milestone Hotel!  The doorman Steve enthusiastically greeted us upon arrival and check-in was super easy with friendly and welcoming staff.  The hotel itself is charming with English “touches” everywhere.  Hotel was immaculate and felt very safe with their Covid precautions.  They gave us a complimentary upgrade on our room to a king size bed.  The room was clean and updated with an extremely comfy bed and pillows.  The room had an outlet panel that allowed for American plugs so super helpful for hair straightener and charging our iPhones without having to use a voltage converter, even though we had brought one.  We didn’t spend a lot of time at the hotel as we were out and about seeing the sights of London, but did enjoy a few drinks in the bar…"
August 2021,"Amazing wedding and a lovely stay, thank you so much!","The team at Milestone helped us organise our small, intimate wedding after COVID ruined our plans for a big countryside wedding.  I just wanted to say both Leo and Angelo did an amazing job and we'll be customers for life. Couldn't be happier with it."
September 2021,Absolutely outstanding venue for a private dinner,"We were looking for a venue to host a private dinner for 24 people to celebrate two “significant” birthdays. From the first contact with Milestone they could not have been more friendly, efficient and professional. The interior of the hotel is very elegant and reminiscent of its private home origins. Suggestions for organising the evening which began with drinks in the Lounge followed by dinner on three tables in the Windsor room were very helpful. On the night everything from the greeting of guests by the doorman, through to the service in the Lounge and then the dinner were very organised. We had been offered a choice of menus for the guests to select from and all of them have commented on the quality of the three courses, the Amuse Bouche and the Pre- desert. A very enjoyable…"
September 2021,a lovely return....,"We haven't visited The Milestone for a few years, and happily returned to this beautiful and excellently-run hotel.  It is everything one expects of a 5* and more.  Andrew and his entire team, from housekeeping to maintenance and front-of house to dining are a credit to the prestigious Red Carnation Group.  Safety measures are carefully observed without being intrusive, and attention to detail is key.  Thank you all for a wonderful stay."
September 2021,Afternoon Tea,"Went here for afternoon tea. The room where tea was served was much smaller than I expected and was really only big enough for 4/5 couples. This meant that we could hear other people’s conversations, particularly two gents who were talking loudly while having tea , which was a bit off putting. However, that is where the criticism ends.   The staff were very polite and went above and beyond to make the experience really nice. The selection of sandwiches and cakes was fantastic and delicious. There was a variety of teas to try and we were offered top ups of all refreshments- if you can manage it. We were too full!   I would definitely recommend this hotel for afternoon tea."
September 2021,5 star hotel with 6 star staff.,"The Milestone hotel truly lives up to Bea Tollman’s saying ‘You can build a palace, but it means nothing if you don’t focus on your guests. All guests want to feel special’…. The staff were very successful in this. Making my partner and I feel that we were the only guests and totally special.  An awesome hotel, steeped in history and an individual uniqueness."
August 2021,Two night stay at the Milestone Hotel and our wedding day!,"The team at the milestone and I worked together the last few months in preparation to the wedding day and we felt special throughout.  Leo and his team were absolutely amazing and definitely offered five star service. Leo assisted us with the wedding planning, he went above and beyond to ensure the day went exactly as planned, he even allocated us the perfect guest room - which made me relax on the day as I needed the extra space to do hair and makeup.   Daniel (the chef) custom made the dinner menu and the food was absolutely perfect! It was the best Beef Wellington me and our guests have ever had. We have not stop getting compliments about how great the service and the food was.   Thank you to Leo, Daniel and their teams for making my wedding day extra special to me and my now…"
August 2021,"Excellent stay, charming hotel and fabulous team","Lovely welcome by Tara and the concierge team plus a welcome drink of champagne. Room 303 with small balcony. Intimate room with ""hidden"" wardrobes. Loved the décor and history the Stables (bar). Angelo in the bar è molto bouno. Ruinart champagne offered, a favourite of mine.  Housekeeping prompt and efficient.  Very comfortable bed and quality linen. Probably the best hairdryer I've ever used in a hotel of this standard, with socket and mirror to hand. A superficial point perhaps but important to me! Peaceful outside with very little road noise (Sunday night).  Breakfast very good in beautiful dining room. Enjoyed the cartoon artwork.  Steve the concierge is knowledgeable, friendly  and has lots of suggestions. Very welcoming.  Great location. Highly recommended. Much enjoyed. …"
August 2021,Simply amazing,The Milestone is my favorite London hotel and look forward to staying here every visit we have to UK. All the staff here are absolutely lovely and so kind. Breakfast is fantastic with a lot of options. Comfortable and quiet rooms and perfect location.
August 2021,Amazing Stay,"We just got back from another amazing stay at the Milestone.  We stayed a week, had two rooms, one for me and my wife and the other for our two daughters, 11 and 14.  This was our third stay in 4 years.  So we can definitely state that COVID has not changed the experience at the Milestone.  Still the same friendly staff, that truly make you feel like you are coming home.  The hotel was as usual very clean and the rooms taken care of every day. The restaurant was great, had breakfast every morning and dinner one night.  Really would not know COVID had changed anything other than the staff wear masks.  The breakfast buffet is gone but you can still order anything and they bring it to you.  They were very attentive to our daughter's food allergies.  And the concierge team did an…"
July 2021,Utterly divine in every way!,"My mum and I stayed at the Milestone this weekend and it was utterly DIVINE! We were celebrating my graduation, and the hotel went above and beyond to make it super special. The staff were all charming, especially our main host Quentin, and the lovely doorman Tim; all very attentive and it was top class service. The hotel itself wasn’t missing a thing- our room had the most beautiful views of Kensington gardens, and everything was pristinely cleaned with all the tip top finishing touches. The spa was also beautiful, and the breakfast was amazing. I couldn’t recommend this hotel more, whether that be for friends/family/couples, and I will absolutely be returning. Thank you for the perfect stay!"
July 2021,A Perfect Location,"I had my sisters Bridal shower on 3rd July this year.  The team at the Milestone hotel were absolutely impeccable. They were perfect, they made us feel so welcome and went out of their way to accommodate all of our needs. From helping us load items into the car, to receiving items for the Bridal shower before we arrived at the venue. I cannot fault a single thing. I would personally like to thank Leo for all his help from the start of my enquiry to finishing my event he went above and beyond so thank you Leo. We had more than enough food and drink which guests boasted how lovely and delicious it was. The venue was perfect and I hope to use it again in future as the staff and experience at the milestone  hotel Left such a lasting impression on me and my guests. Thank you so much…"
August 2021,Afternoon Tea,"There are about a zillion places to have afternoon tea in London, but we chose this place because it had good reviews and the pictures looked good.  When we arrived, the doorman knew our names and welcomed us in - a little touch that made us feel very welcome.  The building and interior are stunning, and we were welcomed into a cosy room straight out of the 1920s and about as plush and luxurious as you get.  The food was magnificent and plentiful. Lots of sandwiches with interesting fillings and beautiful cakes. We were told to let them know when we wanted the scones as they were baked freshly for us, and indeed they were as they were served warm with home made jam and thick clotted cream.  The table setting was stunning and the staff were both attentive and friendly, but not…"
August 2021,GREAT AFTERNOON TEA FOR THOSE WITH ALLERGIES,"I have a milk allergy so finding an afternoon tea suitable has been hard, however milestone were fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff. Felt like royalty. The rod was amazing and to be able to have such a variety of cakes was brilliant. We will be back!"
July 2021,Lovely stay and staff.,Staying at the Milestone Hotel was absolutely delightful. The staff were absolutely lovely and so attentive. Access to the pool and sauna were a lovely treat. I would definitely recommend staying here.
July 2021,Delightful afternoon tea,"Had champagne afternoon tea before visiting the Van Gogh exhibition. Best afternoon tea we’ve had in London. Excellent sandwiches, freshly made scones and also strawberries in addition to the fabulous selection of cakes. Would highly recommend and looking forward to our next visit."
July 2021,Perfect from start to finish - Very friendly,"We arrived for the Wimbledon weekend, and the minute we walked up to the front door, we were treated with amazing service and friendliness.  Front Door man was expecting us, and parked car as arranged. Front concierge and every member of staff were so friendly an helpful .  Free glass of champagne each taken in bar once we packed ( spent tens of thousands in the Dorchester for double + the money and never had a sniff of a free drink ). Bar food was excellent.  Sky TV in room. Room was perfect, water and chocolates each night on turn down service. Bathroom very big .  Breakfasts amazing. Decor beautiful.   Thank you for everyone at the Hotel, who made our stay an amazing experience, and we will now use this as our base in London... perfect in every way.... could not recommend…"
June 2021,Delightful hotel,"An unexpected 2 nights in London meant a  hotel booking to a hotel we have never stayed in . Any london trip from now on will mean staying at the Milestone . In a time where covid is an excuse for bad service, the staff at the Milestone were exemplary . Nothing was too much trouble  The stables bar is beautiful , the rooms are luxurious , the location is perfect and the service is 1st class  See you again soon"
July 2021,A true 5 star hotel,"Perfect in every way. Each staff member is exceedingly kind, going above and beyond to make your stay exceptional. Can not say enough kind things about this hotel and their staff. The location is perfect. The decor, beautiful. Everything in perfect order."
July 2021,An amazing place to stay,"We had a great room with amazing decoration and a lovely ensuite bathroom. The beds are huge and so comfortable. The hotel is in such a great location in London within easy walking distance of many tube stations. The decor is brilliant throughout the hotel - very unique. I love the Stables Bar and the Oratory. The bar staff are very knowledgeable, providing a great list of cocktails and drinks. The whole staff make this a very friendly hotel. I will definitely be back."
July 2021,A fabulous night away from home,We had a fantastic night at The Milestone. The staff are extremely helpful and always have a smile. The room was fabulous providing a great break for us and our dog. we left very well fed and watered having had a very relaxing stay.
July 2021,Hidden Gem,"From the start of my booking to checking out after our stay, the staff at The Milestone have been explementary.  The Chesterton Restaurant far exceeded our expectations with my mother saying ""this is best meal I have had in ages"".  It was very easy conversation with all the staff and nothing was too much trouble especially when we turned up in The Stables Bar at 21.50hrs asking for a dessert which was thoroughly enjoyed by my Mum and Brother, a bottle of organic red wine (delicious) and a bowl of twiglets for myself.  But as a few of the staff are Italian the evening was rounded off by them qualifying for the next round of the Euros.  Danny and Jose  (Concierge) were very knowledge of the area and had a very warm welcome when you come and left the hotel.  This was far better…"
June 2021,"Best high tea in London, again","Visited the milestone after a while for afternoon tea. We used to be regulars with dew years ago and it was fantastic. Glad to say it is even better now! Kudos to the team, we had an excellent afternoon, my guests thoroughly enjoyed it."
June 2021,The best hotel in the world,"There are many things one could say about this hotel: central location, stunning decor, great bar and restaurant. What really makes this hotel better than any else is the staff. They really put the heart in what they do and make your staying memorable.  Leo was really professional and made us feel important.  Steve the doorman is the best, so funny! And prepare to be amazed when you go to visit Angelo and Giacomo at the bar!"
July 2021,Top class,"Absolutely fabulous, totally recommend this hotel, the staff are at the top of their game , professional, friendly, helpful and genuinely care about the guests. The cocktails in the bar are top draw , my suite was very good . Well done Milestone you win my vote , Thank you for everything"
July 2021,They go the extra mile at The Milestone Hotel and Residence,"We spent 3 nights from the 22nd July to 25th July, it was my 70th birthday on the 23rd and my wife`s  67th birthday on 24th, and I can honestly say that from the moment we entered the hotel, to the time we left there was nothing they wouldn`t do to make our stay special. I would like to say a BIG thank you to the reception for all their help, and the restaurant staff for their excellent service and great breakfasts. I would also like to thank the manager for my birthday cake and drink.   Thanks again for a great time."
July 2021,"Classy, Elegant, Traditional, 10/10 service","A beautifully stunning hotel, where you are made to feel welcome the moment you are at the door.  The service the guys throughout this hotel provided was incredible, they honestly could not do more for you, it was a pleasure to be treated like that, wherever you are in the hotel.  Be sure to book the pool and the sauna facilities on/before arrival, the room/hotel has stunning decor and is beautifully kept. The restaurant area is class.  It was also great to see Andrew the manager in the foyer, at the front of house talking with guests, this shows guests are important and appreciated.  My wife and I were here for our anniversary and it was made to feel special. With Kensington Gardens on your literal doorstep, and the High Street round the corner, You are in for a treat staying…"
June 2021,Faultless from start to finish…..,Faultless From Start to Finish  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left the service was fantastic. We were welcomed home and it felt like an oasis amidst the buzz of a reawakening London. We were celebrating what should have been our honeymoon and the staff treated us like royalty from beginning to end. Breakfast was sublime the room was spotless and we will definitely be back.   Thank you to all the team at The Milestone. We can’t recommend you enough.
June 2021,Simply superb,"What a simply delightful experience! Stayed for two nights, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The room was a good size for a London hotel, with beautiful, comfortable duvets, pillows and linen, an attractive and well stocked bathroom and more than enough storage space.  All food and drinks were spot on and the dinner in the main restaurant was superb. My other half had the Dover sole, and me the lamb..both tasted exquisite and were partnered with cracking wine, ably advised by the attentive yet discreet waiting team.  The spa / gym is open (you need to book) and the bars are open too.  Finally, from the moment you are met at the steps, until the moment you depart, the service is impeccable.  Will be our go to London hotel for sure, from now on, as the location is perfect too. 5…"
June 2021,Excellent,"Excellent hotel. Great location in Kensington. Fabulous staff, couldn’t do enough for us. Lots of character. Spotlessly clean. Delicious breakfast. No tea/coffee in room so when I called reception they brought some freshly brewed drinks straight to our room."
June 2021,An incredible experience all round,"We could not recommend this hotel enough. The staff are absolutely wonderful and so welcoming. We bought our dog and he was treated just as special as we were. He got his own bed, bottled water and a towel. We opted for a pet sitter and because there was not one available, Fran at the hotel stayed and looked after him for us, which we were truly grateful for. The bed was one of the comfiest beds I have stayed in. The room was lovely and sparkling clean. We even had a drink at the bar and that was lovely too. This hotel made our weekend away. Whilst it was our first time staying at this hotel, it will not be our last."
July 2021,Above and beyond,"Well, where do I start, the hotel service was amazing, the night staff where so helpful. The kept the spa area open after hours for me as it we were newly weds. The hotels rooms are impeccable, clean, comfortable. The bathrooms are WOW! Powerful shower and hot hot water! AC rooms. Would 100 % recommend. And can’t wait to be back again! Thank you Milstone staff.   Mr and Mrs Tariq"
July 2021,Excellent service and generosity,Nitin was very helpful during my visit to hotel. I didn't stay there but needed help and he went miles to help me. Jose Was very generous with directions to help me during my time in London. I will be back soon.
July 2021,Hospitality at its finest,"We had the chance to celebrate our wedding anniversary and having started a new job down the road, this was a perfect venue and timing. On arrival all the front of house staffs including Lorena, Tara and Steve welcomed us, very pleasant and smiling. We went for a drink to the bar, my husband tried the signature old fashioned - it’s an experience you’ll never forget. Angelo the mixologist does a fantastic job to showcase his expertise, you got to go to The Stables bar. We then headed to The Cheneston’s restaurant - very cozy with a grand Victorian decor with wooden panel and lovely caricatures. Grant and Paolo were simply brilliant they explained the menu very well, did check back, offered options and genuinely serve with care. Kudos to the chef for the great British menu they…"
June 2021,First class service,"A real home from home. Service was memorably good. Every member of staff made you feel welcome and looked after, from the lovely doorman and reception team to the waiting staff and housekeeping. I stayed with my young son and they upgraded our room free of charge on arrival to a beautiful suite overlooking Hyde Park. They let us check in early at 7am and re-configured the room to accommodate twin beds. The breakfast was delicious and rooms beautifully clean. This was our first visit to a red carnation hotel and will definitely not be our last."
June 2021,Champagne and Good Cheer,"Champagne afternoon tea to treat my niece. How fabulous to be back in the luxury of my favourite place!  Everybody was so pleased to welcome us and make a fuss of us both. Predictably the afternoon tea was perfection (as always) and Leo and Andrew were on hand to attend to us. Thank you to The Milestone team, cannot wait to return again very soon"
June 2021,"Excellent service, outstanding food a great hotel to go and visit!","I didn't end up staying at the hotel as I live relatively closely, but I have been there a number of times for drinks. This time round we decided to stop by for dinner, the 5 course tasting menu served up by the chef, Daniel, was phenomenal! My partner is also a vegetarian and it is safe to say this didn't dissapoint.   The service led by the manager Leo was fantastic , we also had Angelo serving the drinks (I have had him serve me when I have gone previously) and he has picked out the perfect drinks every time (I am one for trying new things so like hearing the suggestions from the bar staff). One of my favourites was a smokey old fashion but with barrel aged taquila, unfortunately I am allergic to whiskys, and this is the perfect alternative, arguably one of the best drinks…"
June 2021,Hotel stay,"We had a fantastic and memorable short stay at the hotel. The service was first class with and staff very attentive. Incredible food , decadent breakfasts and fantastic cocktails too. Highly recommended."
June 2021,Brilliant Hotel with outstanding service and attention to detail,"I have been to the Milestone Hotel many many times and every time i am astounded at the level of service and attention to detail provided.  On this particular visit to the Milestone we were greeted in the usual friendly and inviting way by the doorman and staff in the reception. Upon arrival Leo escorted us round the hotel showing me the what's what and who's who before we enjoyed the incredible six course tasting meal from the new menu. The Executive Chef, Dan, out done himself on this occasion and i can honestly say that it was one of the best dining experiences i have ever had.  As always after the meal I was handed over to Angelo and Giacomo in the bar and was further treated to the new cocktail menu experience. These two gents really know how to put on a show, from the fun…"
July 2020,"Great hotel, friendly staff, amazing old fashioned!","Had a lovely time, was treated with great reception and enjoyed our stay. Great facilities, would definitely go back. Old fashioned in the bar a must have, ask for Angelo! If you need recommendations of local area Leo was more than helpful too."
June 2021,Beautiful hotel with excellent service and experience,The Milestone delivers an exceptional experience through its staff and its accommodations. The rooms are quiet and beautifully appointed. The food service is excellent. We enjoyed our complimentary full breakfasts each morning in the dining room along with an incredible hotel-catered picnic in Hyde Park for our family. Make sure you visit Stables Bar for a pre or post-dinner cocktail in what has to be one of the coolest bars in London.
June 2021,Amazing welcome home!,"Returning to The Milestone for the first time in 15 months - what an amazing experience! I could not have been more warmly welcomed back, given a beautiful suite, glass of champagne on arrival, staff were as ever really friendly - all asking after my family (remembering the names of my children) and the GM even had a cup of tea with me.  Could not more highly recommend this welcoming, discreet hotel."
May 2021,Attended a themed Evening - with unexpected bonuses.,"This was our first venture 'back into the real world' and we chase this opportunity as it was clearly an intimate environment and experience, therefore number controlled. It was clear on arrival that the staff were genuine with their greeting. So much so that we decided to take afternoon tea , unexpected but such a pleasure. The service was impeccable and quality excellent ( better than the so called best in London of 2019 we experienced not far from Trafalgar Sq ). The room  was quaint and just about in expectation size wise., it overlooked the Park. The feel of the Hotel is very exclusive but without the potential price tag you might expect. As this was our first time, it might be more expensive under different circumstances. The themed meal was expertly presented and the room…"
April 2021,Amazing building in perfect location,"Staff are very professional and kind. They made our stay memorable. Very high standards in all kind of services. Room was spacious and bathroom was stunning. Everything was just perfect, we had a wonderful stay and look forward to coming back here."
November 2021,Home from Home,"After  a really hectic few months, my husband and I were looking forward to spending a few nights at the Milestone Hotel, it did not disappoint. All the staff pulled out the all the stops to ensure we had a really comfortable break, their attention to detail was excellent in all departments.  My welcome card read Welcome home Mrs P and that’s how it felt. We had a wonderful stay and came home refreshed"
November 2021,Home again !,"I absolutely love the Milestone, the team, the ambiance.  I cannot imagine staying anywhere else when I am in London;  this time was no different.  The fact I can bring my dog as well just makes it even more special.  She was treated as well (if not better!) than me. Her own bed, bowls and treats.  Just wonderful.  There are so many good points and so many fabulous staff to mention -  from walking through the front door, to the bar where my dog could join me, it is all impeccable."
November 2021,Fantastic Christmas Weekend,"After a trip to Winter Wonderland walking through the doors of The Milestone was like walking into a home from home.  We stopped into the stables bar for a couple of drinks and were served by Angelo - fantastic service, amazing atmosphere!  My partner had the Milestone Traditional which comes in its own smoke filled bubble and was a joy to experience.  I had the Valkyrie drink and the Rocking Horse - both as beautiful as they were delightful.     The room was just stunning!  A level of class and comfort unmatched so far in my time in London.  The bed was so comfy we almost overslept!    All service was impeccable and calm - you forget they are there until you need them, and then they’re there happy to help.   Can’t recommend this place enough and will most definitely be back…"
November 2021,Festive Afternoon Tea,"This was my second visit to The Milestone ‘post pandemic’ and this time I tried their take on a Christmas afternoon tea. wow. I type this from my sofa and I still feel completely and utterly indulged.  The service team were fantastic, the lounge was full but the team were still attentive, smiling and taking care of all guests with ease.  We tried several teas and enjoyed a half bottle of champagne.  The selection was outstanding and by far the best Turkey sandwich I have ever had.  Kudos to the milestone team, especially mr Ahuja who took my booking, greeted me and my family on arrival and even checked on my table."
November 2021,Love this place!,We love visiting London and it’s such a treat to spend a couple of nights in this lovely hotel so we can enjoy the nightlife too. It’s ultra posh but also ultra friendly. The staff are wonderful and nothing is too much trouble. The rooms are all beautifully furnished and there are spa treatments available for footsore shoppers. The food is great - both in the formal dining room but also in the bar and library - a real treat is to take afternoon tea by the fire. Thoroughly recommended!
November 2021,Classy Comfort,"We have visited The Milestone on a number of (special) occasions and it is always a joy. The staff deliver friendly and excellent service and the surroundings are so comfortable. Located in the heart of Kensington, a short walk from the Albert Hall and Kensington Palace, it’s a perfect place to explore west London. The museums are just a stone’s throw away and Kensington High Street provides a good range of shops, plus good transport links to the rest of London. The hotel is beautifully appointed and the food is excellent at any time of day. Its a lovely place to come home to after a hard day’s shopping. I wouldn’t stay anywhere else."
November 2021,Standards maintained despite restrictions,"An opportunity arose, between restrictions, to revisit this hotel for a couple of nights. We were pleasantly surprised to find that on the face of it nothing had changed, by way of the service, accommodation or dining experience - despite the inevitable shortage of staff due to previous furlough and lay-off requirements. We were unencumbered during our stay and made to feel that nothing was too much trouble."
November 2021,A real treat!,"We recently attended the Royal Variety Performance at the Royal Albert Hall and this hotel came highly recommended and definitely lived up to lofty expectations. Attentive and extremely personable staff, clean cups with each refreshed coffee pot, outstanding breakfast, superb service, cases being taken to our room and suit and dress covers hanging in the wardrobe, bed turned down at dusk with bathroom candle lit and sweets on the pillow, friendly stables bar staff with excellent cocktails both alcohol and alcohol free. Our bedroom was spotless and everything catered for. This really was a real treat!!"
July 2021,Soulless and sterile ,Firstly the good the suite we stayed in was fantastic with all the amenities One could wish for Unfortunately we stayed here while very few were booking this hotel and the staff service suffered For instance at lunch I ordered a club sandwich and had to listen to the waiter having to convince the chef he should make it as it wasn't on the reduced menu The breakfast was a strange affair as with so few guests it was served in a side room and service was not up to the standard we would expect from a 5 star hotel Room service was also lacking presumably due to reduced staff the maid was persistently trying to come into do the turndown service at 5pm and when asked to come back later would return 5 minutes later All In all considering we paid full price for the top suite we found the…
October 2021,Charming and luxurious,"We were attending a long-awaited concert at the Royal Albert Hall and wanted to stay overnight in close proximity.  I am so glad that I chose The Milestone and feel that I need to organise another trip to London to experience the kindness we encountered there!   From our welcome on arrival until our departure, my friend and I found that the staff were so friendly, interested and efficient.  The Manager had left a personal welcome card and unfortunately we did not meet him, but I feel that staff training comes from ‘the top’ and a splendid attitude prevails.  The room was very comfortable, my only concern that there was no ‘walk-in’ shower which I prefer.  I should have checked!  Otherwise, the beds were so comfortable, plenty of amenities provided, it was quiet.  The little…"
April 2021,The perfect home away from home!!,"We love The Milestone Hotel. For the past 12 years, it has provided a home away from home for my parents  when they visit us. Starting with a warm welcome to every need being met with a smile, the service is always outstanding.  The rooms are unique and beautifully appointed. The restaurant is delicious and the Stables Bar is one of the best in London. We cant wait for it to re-open and for many more visits in the future."
April 2021,Milestone Hotel London,"We have stayed numerous time at the Milestone Hotel over the past 12 years. We began in the cozy rooms overlooking Kensington Park when we had no grandchildren and most recently have stayed in the residences with one or two of our six grandchildren for consecutive overnights . Every time it has been utter perfection. The staff always goes above and beyond. My husband and I are accustomed to the best and the Milestone never disappoints. As one of our grandchildren said, “No one ever wants to leave the Milestone.” It is very true."
November 2020,Outstanding service,"I stayed at the Milestone Hotel in November for business but was blown away with the service and the attention to detail. From the moment I entered the building to the moment I left, everything was taken care of and I felt completely at home. I was nervous about travelling during a pandemic but the staff made me feel very comfortable and safe. The food was also excellent and delicious. I would love to come back when it is allowed and I will definitely be bringing my family as well."
March 2021,Virtual Mothers Day experience ,"Me, my partner and our mums recently enjoyed the Milestones Virtual Mothers Day experience.  We particularly loved the immersive demonstrations by Head Chef Dan and the mixologist Angelo. Both of our mums were blown away by this and they can not wait to visit the hotel next time they are in London visiting us both.   Angelo- we will see you in May for a long over due cocktail!   Thank you to all! "
February 2020,"Room not ready, no table at breakfast",I stayed here a while ago but only just got around to leaving a review.  We stayed here for a weekend to see a show and take in the sights of London.  Upon arrival our rooms were not ready but that wasn't too much of  a problem as we were offered a drink in the bar so we relaxed in the bar for a while.  We came down to breakfast the next morning only to be told there are no tables o we would have to eat our breakfast at a coffee table in the lounge.  This is totally unacceptable for what was supposed to be a special weekend so altogether very dissatisfied.
December 2020,Fabulous staff,The last time we stayed it was my birthday and the staff made me feel very special indeed! This time we stayed during Tier 2 restrictions. We were goign to a concert and the staff went above and beyond to ensure we could get food before they had to shut the kitchen. We really appreciated it!  We had a warm welcome which was lovely during these trying times. It really is a very special place.
October 2020,Traditional Afternoon Tea,"In the current climate it was a very pleasant experience to take afternoon tea in this hotel.  This was made even more so by knowing that every attention had been made to social distancing and sanitisation before, during and after our visit, however subtle and discrete.  The selection of teas remains extensive (we have visited before, but omitted the champagne on this occasion) and the sandwiches, pastries and cakes are sublime.  We would particularly recommend the cheese cake (made to the owner's recipe, we're told).  It cannot be easy running such a service at this time, with reduced staff and additional responsibilities, but this did not detract from the ambiance or experience in any way."
October 2020,Such A Special Visit - The Best Afternoon Tea,"I recently visited The Milestone Hotel for a special Afternoon Tea with my mum. It had been a long time coming as we had been waiting for The Milestone to reopen after lockdown, so we were very excited to make the special visit down from The Cotswolds.   The Afternoon Tea was fantastic from start to finish, all the staff are so warm and friendly and instantly made us feel safe (masks, hand sanitizer, social distanced tables). Pranav and Tom made us feel particularly welcome.  The food was incredible, my favourite was the chicken sandwich with crushed almonds (to die for). The scones and pastries were brilliant, kudos to the Chef.  Pranav had excellent tea knowledge and recommended The Mistress Tea (a really nice citrus blend with Bergamot).  We also met Leo, the Food and…"
October 2020,The best afternoon tea in London!,"I recently had the pleasure of visiting the Milestone Hotel for afternoon tea and it was certainly the best afternoon tea I have ever had! The entire experience was fantastic, from just making the reservation to the actual visit itself.   Firstly, the Park Lounge is a lovely setting to enjoy an afternoon and we were certainly made to feel very welcome by Pranav, who made sure we enjoyed our experience and was kind enough to show us some of the beautiful suites in the hotel.  The selection of sandwiches, scones and cakes were explained to us as well as all dietary requirements noted carefully. All of the food was delicious and we especially enjoyed the scones. I was particularly impressed by our waiter, Tom, who had a fantastic knowledge of tea and recommended several different…"
October 2020,Always a treat,"It is always a treat heading into Kensington however in a time of such uncertainty and protocols I was slightly apprehensive as I headed into London to visit my usual Afternoon Tea spot.  This being said, all those nerves disappeared as I entered The Milestone, it was absolutely magical as always.   As I entered, the team there offered me hand sanitiser, kindly helped me with their ‘track and trace’ and took me to my table. Our waiter, Tom, suggested that the lockdown period had allowed the chef to enhance the Afternoon Tea offering and he was certainly correct. The new additions to the stand were fantastic, especially the sandwiches. The spinach bread used for the Cheddar sandwich was appealing both on the eyes and on the palate, whilst the soft herbs in the creme fraiche…"
February 2020,Best stay,Best service and the best hotel ever. It had everything included from a swimming pool to a gym to a lovely breakfast and an incredible bar and restaurant. All staff is so attentive and eager to please. The room 507 is lovely as it oversees the park. We loved our very brief stay and will return ASAP.
February 2020,Superb luxury hotel,"Wow what a stunning hotel it’s just over the road from Kensington Palace and The Royal Albert Hotel is just up the road. Hotel was immaculate. Hotel staff were fantastic they was very friendly nothing was too much trouble they couldn’t help you enough I felt like royalty they carried our cases up to our room, opened the doors we got a welcome drink on arrival and as it was my birthday they even presented me with a birthday dessert. It’s an easy location to reach via tube or taxi. Great bar with plenty of choice of drinks from soft drinks to cocktails. The breakfast was amazing ordered room service it’s was delivered on time and it was cooked to perfection. Would highly recommend staying here"
November 2019,Never dissapoints,"This is a, somewhat, delayed review having stayed at the Milestone at the end of November. Regrettably, illness prevented my submitting this review earlier. I must add that my illness was nothing to do with the hotel.  A truly outstnding hotel that never dissaponts. i am unable to find fault with any aspect of the hotel and we look forward to returning soon."
February 2020,BAR SERVICE GREAT,"I been in the bar with a friend, for a couple of drink, the bar manager Angelo was great, very kind ,friendly, warm professional and  lot of knowledges. Nice atmosphere, bar service excellent and drinks delicious! I’ll back 100%  Keep going guys"
February 2020,One of the best afternoon teas in London,"Lovely afternoon tea served by Antonio, was even given extra smoked salmon sandwiches which are the best I’ve had!  Great hotel with friendly front of house staff greeting you as you enter the hotel.  Can’t wait for my next visit."
February 2020,Superb birthday & valentines weekend,"Stayed over the valentines weekend, superb food both in room and private dining, service excellent. Upgraded to the Park Suite, luxurious & spacious with attention to detail. Lovely small spa area which we had to ourselves. All staff very helpful, polite and professional at all times. They went out of their way to make us feel welcomed & ensure a wonderful stay. Highly recommend."
February 2020,Very special place,This was our second stay at The Milestone Hotel and from the moment we arrived to the moment we left our stay was perfect in every way. Customer service is second to none. We had our dog with us and were made to feel welcome and included. Room service sandwiches arrived promptly and were delicious. We ate in the restaurant for the first time and enjoyed the intimate atmosphere and delicious food. Thank you to all the staff! We want to return. Just need to save a few pennies first.
February 2020,Absolutely fantastic,"Can’t rate this hotel highly enough, we absolutely loved it.  The one thing that stood out the most was the staff.... each and everyone was super friendly and helpful with a big smile. Nothing was too much trouble..... we have stayed in lots of hotels all over the world from 0 stars to 7 stars and the staff at the Milestone are by far the best. Special mention to Steven the doorman- what a lovely welcome (Thank you)   We had afternoon tea which was lovely   The room was fairly small but perfectly formed with lots of little extra touches. Bathroom was large and spotless (only slight criticism was the shower flooded the floor when used)   It was quiet with good non noisy aircon and a lovely breakfast  Definitely one of my favourite hotels!"
February 2020,Just like it should be!,"Wow! Yep, they've figured it out. I love this hotel.  Service is remarkable.  Hotel is immaculate.  Perfectly located and elegant.  Stay here if you enjoy old world charm and a personalized welcome from the staff each day and tea/coffee brought to your room each morning.  Mr. Carson (Downton Abbey) would be proud.   Do not stay here if you require fast paced party atmosphere and like to talk on your phone during meals and in other quiet places.  Please go somewhere else- thank you."
December 2019,It’s a milestone of superior and superb hotel services,"Wonderful Hotel with great hospitality and warm welcoming from staff, particularly from Mr. Blake Sur..  What a great person among other great staff who let us feel we are at home..  Mr. Blake truly deserves a great & special appreciation for all the amazing support and guidance during the whole process of our hotel experiences: pre-booking, during booking confirmation, at check in, during our stay, at the check out, even after the check out.. Big thanks to him and all other great and friendly staff!   I & my family stayed 11nights (Dec 20 -31, 2019) as a 1st time at this hotel using 3 connected suites & rooms. Based on such amazing experiences, the milestone will always be our 1st choice when coming to London.. and we will always coordinate through Mr Blake Sur.. who has been…"
February 2020,Amazing - I rarely repeat hotels but I will for this place.,"Amazing - I rarely repeat hotels but I absolutely will for this place. I usually like to try different places. And in London, there are so many great places. But my stay at the Milestone was perfect. All the details are in place. So many hotels claim details but then fail to deliver or deliver in a mediocre way. Not so with the Milestone. Charming place, kind and helpful but unobtrusive staff, detailed and well-appointed rooms, relaxed and beautiful environment. So I’ll definitely be back!  And one more thing... usually in these kind of “high class” places, I feel they look me over and size me up as someone who doesn’t rank and doesn’t belong so I end up with sub-par service. Not so here. They were very nice and I didn’t get that snobby, judge-y feel at all.   Kudos to everyone…"
February 2020,The Milestone Hotel,"The Milestone is old world charm, its historic, elegant, the decor has beautiful rich furishings, and expensive original art. They have all the modern conviences. The rooms are large, comfortable, fireplace (that's right), private balcony, artwork. They have an indoor pool. They are located opposite Kensington Palace & Gardens, and accress to Hyde Park, Holland Park. They are in the middle of row after row Poppins white washed mansions. I enjoyed Stable's bar, and Cheneston's restaurant."
January 2020,The milestone hotel ,"Excellent hotel , hospitality, staff !   I would like to extend my thanks to Blake Sur for an amazing hotel experience, I appreciate the hospitality and The milestone will always be my second home.  I will always be loyal to the hotel as it’s my favorite hotel in London and in particular, Mr Blake Sur is the only reason why I keep coming back!   Wish you all the very best and keep up the good work. "
January 2020,Afternoon tea,"We had an amazing afternoon tea here. Nothing was too much trouble for Leo, Silvia and the team. They were so lovely with the kids (even when they got very excited!). Couldn’t recommend more, thanks so much!"
January 2020,Excellent Service!,"To Tom and the team at Hotel Milestone, thank you so much for such an amazing and enjoyable stay. You guys went above and beyond to make our stay so so pleasurable. We truly appreciate it! Great hotel, with great rooms, overlooking the gardens and so close to everything! The room service and the hotel room itself was extremely nice and beautiful. The staff in the hotel were really attentive and left us little gifts and notes based on our conversation and made us feel really really special. Nothing to fault, it was such an amazing stay and Tom and his team made it all really nice for us, thank you so much!"
January 2020,The Milestone goes the extra mile.,"Following our retirement we wanted to stay in a 5 star hotel as part of our celebratory trip to London. After a long career running our own company we understand that customer satisfaction is the bare minimum standard, but customer delight is what we should allstrive for in business. And customer delight is precisely what this very special and focussed hotel delivers. Thank you everyone at the fabulous Milestone 👍"
January 2020,50th BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS,"AMAZING. We both absolutely loved this hotel. From the moment we entered the hotel we was made to feel very welcome and special. The staff are very attentive, happy, helpful and welcoming. They made so many nice little extras and an upgrade (added bonus) for my husbands 50th birthday. My husband will now have a nice memory from his weekend away and how special they made him/us feel and I thank you very much. I highly recommend this beautiful, personal feel hotel, so glad I made the decision to book here,   we will definitely return in the future. You will not be disappointed if you stay here."
January 2020,Mrs simpson,"We stayed here for my sons 21st birthday, the hotel and staff are outstanding, nothing was too much , the reception staff were fantastic, the breakfast was freshly prepared with fantastic service from a waiter . We were upgraded the rooms were beautiful and was presented with homemade biscuits, a lovely touch. Highly recommend this hotel it has the whole package."
January 2020,Fantastic!!!,Fantastic hotel with best possible service. Very kind personnel!! Nice rooms and comfortable beds. Gym with sauna and small pool to relax in. Excellent breakfast! I felt like a queen and will come back!
December 2019,Disappointed and surprised. Nothing special at all.,"I can not understand why this hotel scores as highly as it does. It seemed to us to belong in a bygone era, and we are young. The service was stuffy an unhelpful. There was lots and lots (and lots) of staff, but they were tripping over each other and seemed put out if they had to help. You had to ask for everything and when you did it was done for you with very little grace. The dining room as just strange. We were sat in this horrible, cold, uncomfortable room and the experience was just so indifferent. The food was fine, but when you compare the cost of this to what else we had when we were in London you do feel regret. The condition of toilets near the dining room were in a very poor condition, it seems cleaning doesn't take place after a certain time. This was a treat from…"
March 2020,Deserves 6 Stars,"We chose The Milestone hotel as we thought it would be the ideal venue for our very small wedding and it was the best decision we’ve ever made (apart from getting married)! We were looked after so well by the whole team during our two night stay and nothing was too much trouble. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and we were very kindly upgraded to an amazing suite in honour of our special stay at the hotel. It completely surpassed all our expectations – and they were high to start with. I honestly can’t fault anything. The food was outstanding, we loved learning about the art of sabrage and the cocktails were delicious. I will be recommending The Milestone to anyone who wants an extra special stay in central London. We can’t wait to celebrate more special occasions there in the…"
February 2020,"Excellent - in every respect: the location, the room, the service, the bar, the ambience","Having stayed at many of London's five starts hotels over the past decades, this one is by far my favourite. The location is quiet and beautiful, next to the Kensington Gardens, and conveniently central. The size of the hotel and its ambience makes you feel at home instantly. The employees, every single one of them, are highly professional, hospitable and friendly. I strongly recommend this hotel. And yes, the bar! You have to visit the bar! "
March 2020,"Amazing service, beautiful room and delicious breakfast","The service is first-rate. Someone was always around to help or be friendly. The breakfast was absolutely delicious. I didn't have dinner here but would do so next time based on the breakfast.  Though expensive and was a reach for me, I would love to stay here again."
January 2020,Fabulous hotel in a great location,"Second visit to this wonderful hotel. Fabulous location.... especially for the Royal Albert Hall. We had the afternoon tea, which was excellent. All the staff go out of their way to be helpful. Rooms are immaculate. Also used the Valet parking, which was reasonably priced and hassle free. The breakfast was amazing too. "
November 2019,Wonderful British Experience,"If you're looking for a wonderful hotel filled with English charm, the Milestone Hotel is the place for you. The location is perfect - directly across from Hyde Park in the heart of Kensington, The rooms are lovely and the staff could not be more accommodating. The Milestone combines the historic feel of old England with modern amenities. Five stars in every category!"
March 2020,Look No Further,"For those of you looking for the best hotel, the best experience, the best home away from home extraordinary experience, look no further than the Milestone Hotel in London, England. Their exemplary service, accommodations, food, offerings, and concierge access and care will be one of the highlights of your experience and stay in London. Connor at the Concierge desk took such a genuine interest in researching events and plays in the area for my daughter and I to enjoy. Within in minutes we had the best seats at the Lion King and with another request for Lady Diana memorials, he had printed off and mapped out our route along with our following days to make the most of our three days in London. Tim, the doorman, helped us with securing and locating our drivers and David and Antonio…"
January 2020,A home in a Hotel,"In very simple sentience with a full of meaning, milestones hotel is the best hotel in London’s  you can  enjoy the stay with your family, friends, work . You feel that you are in your home , a lot of caring, happiness, smiling, delicious food, relax spa ... & a lot ... , they make a very romantic & family birthday night, love to go there again very soon ."
February 2020,"Incredible hotel, wonderful staff, intimate bar, perfect for families!","The entire Milestone team was incredible!  Our room was beautiful and the staff went above and beyond to ensure our family had the trip of a lifetime. Our kids got to make their own ""mocktails"" in the beautiful bar and even put on the bartender jackets! The room was second to none and entire experience was one of the most memorable experiences of our trip. We will definitely return!"
February 2020,Superb Luxury small hotel with best London location,"We stayed  3 nights in this gorgeous hotel and we had a great time! Very friendly staff, wonderful rooms, lovely breakfast, everything was stunning! The location of the hotel is the best location in London. Many thanks to reception and concierge staff, especially Mrs. Georgiana Jercan who made our stay an unforgetable one. In summer we have 2 trips to London and undoubtedly we will stay to this wonderful hotel who already made us feel part of Red Carnation's Hotels family!"
January 2020,Incredible - couldn't recommend more,"Stayed recently at The Milestone Hotel after numerous year of visiting London. Was given a beautiful. quaint queen room with everything that you could wish for with so many beautiful little touches.   The front facing team are all so incredibly attentive, kind and caring. It would be a crime to name just a few when they all treated me and my partner like royalty. It felt as if we were making friends for life, not visiting a hotel.  The food, across the board, was phenomenal. Room service breakfast was amazing, the perfect start to the day and almost as good as the huge buffet offering in the restaurant. Afternoon Tea was decadent and we definitely enjoyed the option of walking in Kensington Gardens afterwards. The Stables Bar is so full of old world charm but with modern and…"
September 2020,Best Afternoon Tea in Kensington,"Milestone in my view has one of the best high tea experiences in West London. The savory sandwich selection is exquisite and delicious, the chicken and mayo surely must be one of the best I have ever had, while the sweets are also exceptional especially the cheesecake. Highly recommend."
October 2020,PERFECT Afternoon tea!,"Fabulous afternoon tea, following time spent exploring Kensington. My expectation was high and was exceeded in every way - the quality of the tea and the choices available, the setting with the sofas and fireplace, but I especially love the way the staff have a wonderful combination of super professional and yet so friendly. Made it such a memorable visit. Best afternoon tea I have ever had!!"
February 2020,Quintessential English Afternoon Tea,"Lots of hotels offer a good afternoon tea but if you want a memorable experience in classy surroundings then head to The Milestone in Kensington. It’s proper posh without being snobby and the friendly staff go out of their way to look after you - a real treat, either as part of a special celebration or at the end of a hard day’s shopping. Great location if you want to shop in Kensington, visit the museums or enjoy an evening at the Albert Hall, all of which are in walking distance. "
September 2020,Fabulous Afternoon Tea,"How lovely to be able to go back out after lock down - and how fabulous to experience The Milestone's afternoon tea.  Some luxury after all this madness.  I really enjoyed the great selection of teas, and tried something new.  The pastries were, as always, so moreish it didn't help my ""lock down weight"" but the indulgence was worth it. I really hope to be back there again very soon - if not for dinner then another afternoon tea!"
September 2020,Best afternoon tea in London! ,"Truly a memorable afternoon with a fabulous afternoon tea experience. The scones were to die for and the service was good, especially Tom! Highly recommended for the quality, service and atmosphere.  Can’t wait to return. "
September 2020,Amazing Afternoon Tea experience,It was our second time having Afternoon Tea at the Milestone and it did not disappoint!   Leo and Tom’s service was impeccable throughout. They made all four of us feel at home and no detail was left unturned. The food was amazing especially the pastries. Our compliments to the chef! All the Covid protocols are  in place as you expect and the ambiance was just right. Afterwards we enjoyed a tour of the hotel by the duty manager and a wonderful walk through Kensington Gardens which is opposite to the hotel.   We will be back around Christmas  for your festive tea with our children and look forward to the cupcake decorating!
September 2020,Afternoon Tea: Terrific,Fantastic.. Great service. Fantastic food. Unlimited tea and superb selection. Dog friendly. Child friendly. Elegant spacious room. Highly recommended. A return visit for us and we will be back. Just opened September 2020 for afternoon tea. Love the place.
July 2019,"Good, not great.","I stayed here a few years ago b/c I believe they’re managed by the same group as Egerton House, which is one of my all time favorite hotels. This experience just wasn’t as great, so I think I’ll go back to my old standby, instead. Customer service was fine, but nothing outstanding. Same with the room. It was pretty small and cramped, although lovely. "
August 2019,A true find,"Recommended to me by a friend - and I, now too, would highly recommend The Milestone for a wonderful experience in Kensington London.   Visited to attend a friends wedding so spent some a few nights there pre and post wedding celebrations. The location was perfectly  situated across from the park with shops and tube station close by. The rooms are lovely - giving the perfect balance of old world style with spacious and very clean, high quality presentation. The extra touches made it for me, like the curated confectionary turn down service each night. The breakfasts (and food in general) were outstanding.  Truly what sets this apart is the service. The team there are world class; welcoming, attentive and genuinely want to make your experience the best it can be. Will certainly…"
February 2020,The Hotel for Queens & Kings,"We stayed in the Milestone Residence for a full weekend, and again the service, the atmosphere, the room, the park view everything makes the experience really unique! It is like to be in London in 2020, but not really there, it is more a living book of history with all the amenities and advantages of XXI Century!  I forgot to say that we got upgraded to my favourite room! Thank you! Staff is very professional and helpful in any single aspect and need. The underground SPA was indeed useful for relaxation. But above all the breakfast experience is super amazing, so many choices available and  so nice to have it in  private as part of the room service.  Really recommended!"
November 2019,Traditional afternoon Tea,"We were bought a traditional afternoon tea as a gift from a friend. We received a lovely traditional friendly welcome, and were introduced to our waitress. The room we were in was empty (which was a shame as I love to nose 👃). It was nicely decorated and not too fussy and really lovely and clean. We were given a table for two in the corner. I had already let them know that one of us was vegi and they were excellent with communicating this. When the sandwiches and cakes 🍰 were brought over they were very good and put the two cakes that had gelatine in on a different plate which I appreciated. The sandwiches were good, cakes 🧁 were good lots of variety, and after that there are scones ! The scones were better than the cakes in my opinion. Its worth noting that they are happy…"
November 2019,Work and Tennis,"I was in London for business and I stayed 3 night onto the Milestone Hotel. Absolutely fantastic. Typical English space...the room was very elegant and refined...toilet with bidet...everything clean. Fantastic English breakfast...I went to the O2 Arena to see ATP finals and when I came back...in the room I found some sweets in the shape of a tennis ball...great! Special thanks to Natalia Crudele ... very friendly, helpful and attentive to detail ...and the barman Angelo ...also very friendly and available!"
November 2019,Just when you think a hotel can’t get any better,"It had been almost two years since we last visited The Milestone. Two years too long.   Just when you think a hotel can’t get any better (I’ve given them 100% in the past) The Milestone does.   Their attention to detail is remarkable. The rooms are beautiful. The bar and restaurant are olde worlde without being stuffy.   But it’s the staff that make the Milestone magical.   From the first welcome back (using our name) to the final enthusiastic wave off, every member of the team gave 110%. And the bar staff? 150%!  They are amazing. Making a G&T becomes a work of art, pouring champagne perfection and if you really want to see a show, order a Milestone Old Fashioned - Wow!!   We stayed two nights in a club suite room overlooking the park. It’s a clever two story design with a…"
October 2019,Well now!,"This was an excellent hotel. We mentioned that we were celebrating a special occasion, and you'd have thought they were celebrating their own instead of helping ours be special. They decorated our room for it, gave us a kind welcome card, and left us all sorts of biscuits and other treats from their kitchens to help us celebrate.  The staff here was so attentive and helpful, even for just a one-night stay; it impressed us very much.  The room was just beautiful, we'd have been happy to stay longer. Very comfortable, huge bed; sofa; desks; not wanting for space at all. The common areas of the hotel were also striking, with gorgeous dark hardwood everywhere, fit for a pipe-smoking Oxford don.   The location is a really (famously) pleasant part of London; it's right on Hyde Park,…"
November 2019,Lovely!,"Great location, comfortable rooms, tastefully decorated, delicious breakfast and high-tea. But the BEST factor of this hotel is the service. Everyone is helpful and friendly. They remember you by name and always greet you with a smile. Highly recommend it! "
October 2019,Milestone Birthday Celebrations,"We recently treated our best friends to a surprise weekend at The Milestone for a very special birthday.  I emailed ahead of our visit and every request and more were seamlessly in place . We have enjoyed many wonderful weekends here, but this was our friends first visit.  To say they were overwhelmed at the warmth, kindness and attention to detail by every member of the Milestone team is an understatement!!  From the moment we arrived , everyone greeted us and wished our friend Peter a Happy Birthday, we were led to the fabulous bar and were given a wonderful glass of champagne, the weekend just kept getting better and better. There was a birthday card in the room and a wonderful birthday cake was delivered at afternoon tea!  We cannot recommend The Milestone highly enough, if…"
October 2019,Amazing Service and Staff!!,"Stayed at The Milestone in early October.  From the minute we arrived all of the staff were outstanding!  Kudos to Leo, who arranged for a delicious full breakfast in a lovely dining room while we awaited our room and also recommendation of Ffiona's Restaurant for dinner.  Each staff member was so welcoming and gracious.  Great location in Kensington across from Hyde Park.  Asked for ice for a sore hip and received 2 ice packs, which helped tremendously.  We look forward to staying at The Milestone again ... absolutely 'the best'!!"
October 2019,Outstanding!,"I have stayed at several luxury hotels but I have never experienced anything remotely close to the amazing treatment I received at the Milestone Hotel in London.  From the moment I arrived, I was greeted, by name, by multiple staff members in the lobby.  I was afforded every amenity I could imagine and I never lacked anything at anytime.  Everyone--from the doorman to the concierge to the housekeeping attendants to the front desk staff--everyone was superior in all aspects.  The smiles, effervescence, and cordiality were unsurpassed.   I offer a special thanks to Ronald Kawere for his splendid service, and commendation to Jonathan Raggett for having such an exceptional staff.  I will recommend this hotel to everyone who visits London.  It is superior."
October 2019,Bob A,"We stayed at the Milestone in early October 2019 and had a wonderful stay!    The staff went out of their way at every level of service.  The front desk, concierge staff, doormen, housekeeping and waiting staff were all gracious and helpful.   The breakfast was fresh and delicious. Fresh coffee and delicious buffet and menu items.  The turn down service was accompanied nightly by English candies and/or scones.  Fresh flowers and beautiful artwork are located throughout the hotel. Beautiful location near Kensington Palace.   We highly recommend this hotel if you prefer a traditional ambiance over more trendy hotels.  We look forward to visiting again.  Bob and Lori A"
November 2019,The best hotel service I’ve ever received,"I can honestly say, our (my wife & I) weekend stay at the Milestone hotel was amazing. The team were outstanding, really considerate and courteous...but not the fake type you normally see by really genuinely trying to do their best for you and you felt it. They were faultless from the reception desk team, to room service to the gentleman who bought my bags up! And a special mention has to go to Fran who instantly made us feel at home and as if there wasn’t anything he wouldn’t do for us. Definitely the best hotel team and service I have ever seen or experienced. This hotel doesn’t deserve 5 stars...it deserves 6!!!!!  Thank you again to the team, you made our anniversary weekend extra special!"
December 2019,Top service,"Me and my husband stayed in December and had a lovely experience. We traditionally stay in a london hotel in december to enjoy the christmas period. This year we stayed here and by comparison, this hotels service excelled. Top marks for service!!"
December 2019,"Lovely vacation, great location","Visited in December and had a wonderful stay.  Historic, yet inviting property conveniently located.  The staff  exceeded my expectations, everyone was professional and pleasant.  I very enjoyed my visit.  Thank you."
December 2019,I never wanted to leave!,"I absolutely loved my stay at The Milestone. From the second we arrived the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome.  The Hotel itself is charming and full of character. We stayed in the Jungle room and although not decorated to my taste, the bedding was very good quality and the bed itself was very comfortable. There was some lovely personal touches in the room, like fresh biscuits that tasted exquisite. We had cocktails in The Stable lounge in the evening and after a recommendation from the bar staff had one of the most delicious cocktails I have ever tasted. It wasn't something I would've ordered myself so I'm so pleased they made the choice for me as I now have a new favourite tipple, the Tramonto. The location is ideal for sight seeing and of course shopping.…"
December 2019,Amazing ! A wonderful place to stay....,"We spent just one romantic night at this lovely old townhouse hotel, it's truly gorgeous inside, very ""olde English"", cosy and opulent. Our room was just beautiful - 105 - and had everything we could possibly want. We were told the rooms were small, but this wasn't small at all, and the bathroom was very large indeed. Don't forget to ask for your ""tea and coffee box"" if you like to make tea in your room ! It's all very cute, and we were gifted some delicious home made biscuits in a box, some gift tea bags, and a Christmas soap ! The welcome was lovely, I was shown around the hotel and the room, staff are personal and friendly, but wholly professional. It was quiet, and serene in the hotel, no noise, or parties, or sounds of other people at all. I would love to return soon...."
December 2019,YESS WE MADE THE BEST CHOICE 🔥,It feels like you are part of the family. Wonderful place to stay in front of Kensington Palace. Service is a high priority at this place. It feels like a hot bath every time you are pampered by the staff . I will say go and try this top hot spot
December 2019,Amazing staff,"I had a fantastic stay at Milestone Hotel in December. The room, bed, duvet, chairs, TV screen, bathroom etc was very good. I believe there were in all eight towels in the bathroom, two of them really big and fluffy bath towels. And two bathrobes. Both the room and the bathroom had beautiful décor.  All guests receive a welcome drink in Stables Bar. New guests will also get a tour of the hotel, guided by the butler (yes, the butler).  Do say yes to tuck down service. You’ll get a lighted candle on the bath tub and sweets on the bed (I got a box with nuts and dried fruit the first day and tasty small meringues the next). You also get bottled water, new towels and the bed made ready for sleeping.  What impressed me most at Milestone was the attitude, enthusiasm, attention to…"
December 2019,Stables Bar - Awesome,I've been to many bars in many parts of the world but the cocktails and service here are second to none.The bar itself is such a lovely quiet place to relax in and the staff are amazing knowledgeable and helpful.  I loved one of the cocktails so much I tried to recreate it at home and failed miserably. I emailed the bar and not only did I get a reply within 5 minutes but it was good enough to give me the full recipe.  Everything in this bar and hotel was fantastic. Cannot recommend it enough.
December 2019,Amazing first stay!,"The entire staff at the Milestone was friendly, competent and so welcoming. After checking in, I was shown to a comfortable and tastefully decorated room with design personality. Little touches like small gifts of cookies and tea made it feel like Christmas. I loved the breakfast and even though I was traveling alone, was engaged in conversation by the dining team. Any request was immediately seen to. The cozy Stables bar had 2 incredible bar staff concocting some really special drinks. And as I checked out, there were more cookies for the road. I can’t wait to stay here again. "
December 2019,"Great location, beautiful setting and perfect service","We go to London at least couple times a year and have stayed at various hotels. The Milestone is hands down our favorite place to stay! The location (Kensington) is not far from Paddington station, making it easy to get to and from Heathrow Express - it's also close to the subway, and just a walk away from a shopping area. However, the hotel itself is right next to the park, providing the proper an escape from the hustle bustle of London. The service is attentive and personable - it felt like they personally knew you versus you being one of many guests. Definitely try the hotel breakfast - it's pretty phenomenal! We will most definitely come back to this charming hotel, thank you for having us!"
December 2019,Wonderful Hotel and team,I stayed at this wonderful hotel for one evening last week. The attention to detail and natural engagement of the front of house team at this hotel is A rare and welcome treat these days. They just know how to do the small things that make a difference so well.
October 2019,Perfection in Kensington,"Absolutely fabulous hotel. Beautiful in every way from the room to the lobby to the bar and the restaurant. Great service, wonderful friendly staff. Had a delicious, delightful afternoon tea, a light breakfast and drinks and coffee in the bar. Perfection!! Wonderful bath and soaps and shower gel in the bath, comfy bed, delicious nighttime sweets. Fabulous location a bit away from it all, but not to far from Kensington tube station. Highly recommended!  "
October 2019,A magical experience in this jewelbox hotel and charming neighborhood,"I just stayed here and cannot recommend it highly enough. There was a snag with my original flight so I had to postpone my trip, and they rebooked my hotel stay free of charge. Everyone was attentive without hovering, the facilities were top-notch, and the morning breakfast spread, which was included with my room, was delicious - even included a fresh green juice. It’s right across the street from Kensington Gardens, near the tube, in a lovely neighborhood that feels like you’re really living in London. Can’t wait to return!"
October 2019,London’s Secret,"My wife and myself had the pleasure of staying at the boutique hotel on the 4th October, from the moment we arrived we could not fault the service we received from all the staff at the hotel, I would also highly recommend the old fashioned tequila cocktail and if your a couple I would also recommend the romance deal as well.  I would like to of kept this hotel secret to others but it just wouldn’t be fare not to say just how good this hotel is"
September 2019,Simply Amazing!,"From the beginning to the end of our stay the staff and services at this red carnation hotel were far exceeding all expectations. Superb location,always helpful happy staff. I have stayed around the world in many many boutique hotels and this is by far the finest. Our Bellmen Tim and Zdravko as well as the management thank you! World class."
September 2019,Phenomenal stay at The milestone,"My mother and I first visit to London will be a stay to remember because of this wonderful hotel. They treated us like royalty. I cannot wait to come back to stay at this hotel. Everyone here all contributed to our stay but a few names that stood out are Concierge Zdravko and John. They are very charming, professional, caring, and gave wonderful customer service. Anything we needed or asked for we were given or directed to. Very knowledgable about the area. The food was also phenomenal, and the room service was very individualized and made us feel special. Every night we returned back to the room it was fixed with chocolates and rose pedels with wonderful music playing. It cannot get any better than that! I most definitely recommend this hotel!"
September 2019,Excellent stay at The Milestone,"Thank you to Mr. Blake who arranged an extremely nice room for us and made sure we had a great experience at the hotel. We visited The Milestone for both business and pleasure. It was our second time staying there and we had a great experience again. The service was fantastic, from the welcome drinks, to the complimentary fruits and sweets. Natalia checked us in and made sure everything was to our liking and Zdravko was kind to give us a complimentary box of breakfast treats to take to the airport since we had to leave at 5:30 in the morning. The service was exquisite and the staff went out of their way to please their guests. We had a fabulous stay and will definitely be back again! Thank you Milestone!"
September 2019,Charming ,"Our first visit to the Milestone - and it was a real joy. We had an exceptional room and the entire staff was most accommodating. Special kudos to Tim, Tom, Jose, Fran, Zdravko and Natalia for making us most at home and answering to our every need. We enjoyed a high tea and probably won’t eat again for a week. The hotel is right across from Hyde Park and Kensington Palace - so it’s quite convenient to a myriad of places. A special accommodation - we’re so grateful we were led to it! Would recommend it to anyone who wants to have access to a plethora of sights - and sounds. Hope to see y’all again very soon!"
August 2019,The Royal Treatment,My family stopped off in London for a few days on the way back from Greece and stayed at The Milestone Hotel for 4 nights. This was our first time staying at this Hotel and I am now rearranging trips so that we may stop over in London for a couple nights again just to stay at The Milestone.  The location is incomparable as it is across from the beautiful Kensington Gardens (where my husband ran every morning) and Palace. The Hotel's ambience transports you back in time without compromising on present day amenities. The rooms are luxuriously appointed and true to English history with beautiful paintings throughout the Hotel. My boys loved the traditional English breakfast and dinner fare and my husband the Old Fashioned with the aromatic smoke at The Stables Bar. I loved that my…
September 2019,High Tea,"The Milestone was a lovely place for High Tea in the late afternoon.  The atmosphere is absolutely beautiful.  The staff at the Tea were amazing.  Very welcoming and met every single need or request we had.  We enjoyed several wonderful teas and delicious treats.  Everything was absolutely amazing.  Would highly recommend the Milestone.  Now that I have found this gem, I look forward to visiting again and this time staying overnight."
August 2019,The Milestone is Miles Above the Rest!,"Our first night in London we stayed at the Milestone Hotel!  What a wonderful experience!  The rooms were lovely and appointed well.  They might be a bit small, but they make up for that in service!!  The staff could not have been more courteous and truly made me feel like I was home!  Teddy the Doorman was just a delight.  The concierges (I wish I could remember their names so I could give them individual credit!) were absolutely outstanding!  They recommended places to see, local pubs for dinner, and much more and never once steered us wrong!!  If I am in London, I will never stay anywhere else!!!"
November 2019,Lovely oldy worldy hotel in Kensington ,Step back in time with this old hotel with wood panelling but had modern touches with pool gym. Breakfast menu is fantastic and is served at your table with everything you can imagine and served on china with silver coffee and tea pots plus small buffet. Staff are all friendly and doorman excellent.  It’s a great hotel with nice clean rooms just off Kensington high street and opposite Hyde park close to Kensington palace 
October 2019,Absolutely wonderful,"After spending a week at this exceptional hotel i can't say enough nice things about it.  From the minute we arrived exhausted from a journey from Alaska the staff pampered us.  Then half the way thru the week i tripped and fell at a tourist site,  and in  need of ice and such they  took incredible care of me.  The room was always immaculate, their standards are extremely high.  I don't usually write reviews but truly i want to share with you that if you pick this hotel you will be making a great choice!  We will be back again for sure.  Extra thanks to Jose, and Natalia and the lovely ladies who took care of our room. Bravo"
October 2019,Lives up to its rating!,"We spent two nights recently and from arrival to departure you are looked after superbly, nothing is to much trouble. Everyone is very friendly and lots of little touches make this hotel stand out from the crowd.  If you like five star service but, in a place that feels like home, then this is definitely the place for you"
September 2019,One of the most AMAZING hotels I have stayed at!,"From the minute you walk into the Milestone Hotel you are looked after. I practically live in hotels and this is by far one of the BEST I have ever stayed at. Their attention to detail, customer service and the luxury of the entire hotel is amazing. One of my favourite things was how friendly and caring the staff were and how they would listen, help and go above and beyond to get the job done. They take excellence to a whole new level."
October 2019,Fabulous!!!,"Upon our arrival with total jet lag, the staff immediately made us feel at home.  The Reception Mgr., Ms Byrne, immediately made sure we were comfortable until our rooms were ready since we arrived early a.m.  and the Food & Bev. Mgr made sure we were fed.  The staff was like family and the facility was gorgeous with a wonderful location.  We were there a week and so sad to leave.  I have never stayed anywhere that had staff who seem to care so much and I felt pampered by everyone.  Would definitely stay here again!"
October 2019,"Superb comfort, beauty, service and peace at The Milestone Hotel","From the moment we arrived at The Milestone, our every need was taken care of. We were made to feel very welcome by the doorman, reservation desk attendant and concierge.  Our beautiful room on the top floor looked out to Kensington Gardens.  Treats were in every corner of the room in pretty boxes - chocolate, dried prunes and English tea.  The bed was extremely comfortable, and the bathroom large with luxurious thick towels and bathrobes.  And the room was so quiet!  Turndown service in the evening was very nice, as our bed covering was rather heavy and bulky - someone whisked it away and stored it for us until the next day! Breakfast was delicious, and we could order anything we wanted in addition to the continental breakfast of meats, smoked fish, fruit and pastries.  My…"
October 2019,"Great Location, beautiful hotel, wonderful service","We loved everything about our stay at the Milestone. First of all, the staff is so friendly and helpful—from the cheerful “welcome home” we got every time we entered, to the directions and restaurant recommendations during our stay, to the personalized welcome notes left in our room—we felt genuinely taken care of!  Every meal we had at the restaurant was delicious; staff spoke very highly of the shrimp stroganoff, and it did not disappoint. So tasty! A real highlight of the stay though was definitely the Stables Bar!! Angelo and the bar staff not only make outstanding cocktails, but truly create a fun and friendly environment. Thanks for such a wonderful experience!"
October 2019,Wonderful Fall 2019 Visit at The Milestone Hotel,"I reserved 3 rooms for our party of 5 consisting of friends and family.  We stayed for 4 days.  I booked via email with the Milestone and had numerous questions regarding our rooms, prices and accessibility.  Their reservation staff fully responded to all of my questions with every email and within 24 hours.   They even included pictures of the potential room features that I wanted to know about in advance.  Upon our arrival, our expectations were more than fulfilled for all five of us:  with a personal tour of each of our rooms, detailed questions answered, item requests for the room and travel questions about London answered and/or fulfilled (also done in advance via email), a complimentary drink in the bar and a full English breakfast everyday in their cheery restaurant each…"
August 2019,Beautiful boutique hotel in London,"We chose the hotel because it was in a quiet area of London  - Kensington - across from Kensington palace. We have been to London quite a number of times but had not known about it. We decided to try it. But what a treat when we got there. From check in to check out. Every single detail was attended to. The rooms were incredible- we had suites which were two stories, even the soaps looked like they would have been bought at Fortnum and Masons. There were two types of robes - one for lounging and one for after a bath. For turn down service they lit a candle and placed it at the ledge of the bathtub so there was a dim light at night. The restaurant was great. We had breakfast - wonderful - and an amazing dinner. Every single person was friendly and helpful - from the doorman to…"
October 2019,The most wonderful hotel in London,"The rooms are beautiful,location perfect at the park and the staff all fantastic. They went out of their way to make our stay the best vacation.I highly recommend also their  chauffeur service-Colin and Nahir are both delightful and knowledgeable. The dinner,tea and breakfast--all the best.. A must for a night or a month.."
December 2019,Lovely lodgings,"Spent five sumptuous nights in this lovely hotel which reminds you why nobody beats the British for customer care.   Treats each night, lovely linens, down pillows and comforters and a location to die for. But I most appreciated a concierge who knew the town and made terrific restaurant and theatre reservations and a doorman who greets you with a smile whenever you return.  Will stay again when I come to London."
December 2019,Exceptional & Detailed Service,"We stayed at the Milestone Hotel based on the wonderful online reviews and everything mentioned was accurate. The service was amazing and the staff were extremely polite/helpful in all aspects. Tim (one of the doormen) was extremely kind, was always interested in our daily activities and was able to help us with any questions. The hotel was very enjoyable and the rooms were very nice as well as the daily breakfast. I would highly recommend this establishment to any visitors!"
November 2019,Soujourn at the Milestone,"My wife and I spent 4 nights at the end of November at the Milestone. Our stay was fantastic!  The quality, care and attention the staff bestowed on us made us feel at home.  After such a marvelous experience, we plan to return to the Milestone next year.  I would recommend this boutique hotel to anyone with a discerning eye for quality who values intimate, highly personalized interactions."
November 2019,Never stayed at a hotel that was half as good as The Milestone.,"We returned to the Milestone for our third visit. I was impressed that all the staff members who had been so helpful on past visits were still with the hotel -- it speaks well of a hotel that it retains quality employees over time. Leo, Peggy, and Natalia were particularly helpful (Thank you!). I would say the quality of staff and their attention to guests is the best of any hotel in which I have stayed. It is genuinely impressive.  A number of the rooms had been renovated since our last stay; the hotel is obviously trying to stay fresh and current. We were in the Matisse Studio, an upgraded room, which to my surprise was decorated with genuine Matisse prints, an unexpected luxury.   We stayed for a full week and enjoyed Thanksgiving dinner at the hotel restaurant. This is a…"
October 2019,Excellent but.....,"Dear Staff at the Milestone, you are all wonderful. You treated us as Yank family. Kind beyond belief and giving in time, advice and patience. We have never been treated like Royalty and had to come to you and London to experience the royal thing.  Thanks for making my wife’s birthday special. I highly recommend you. I can’t wait until I again don’t plan a vacation and end up in London... God Save the Queen.  Pip, pip and all that stuff.  Irv and Fanny Danesh Your former colony (Birthplace of the American Navy) Marblehead, Massachusetts"
September 2019,Top  Hotel in prime location,"We spent 5 nights at the Milestone Hotel and without realizing it also spend an additional 2 nights at another of the Red Carnation Hotels, Hotel 41.  Breakfast is excellent, service, food quality and everything.  Probably the highlight for us at the Milestone.  The other highlight is the concierge, several gentlemen whom know exactly about the surrounding area and there are no shortages to excellent recommendations for dinners, lunches, pubs and so forth.  Their street side service with arrival or departure from any taxi or Uber is also excellent.  Exactly what one wants from a concierge and front of house.  Rooms are also well furnished and a nice style but notably small and the furnishings very unpractical for the size of the room.  Lamps in front of TV's, a plethora of…"
October 2019,Most wonderful afternoon tea,"I stayed at the Milestone hotel in mid october and found it to be very convenient in Kensington. It still has the ""british charme"" the larger brand names are sometimes missing, The rooms are individually styed and all comfort is available. On demand you even get a set for coffee/tea preparation. The staff are polite and knowledgeable and you can feel the personal athmosphere. Will come back!"
October 2019,An excellent hotel,"My daughter and I visited for her 10th birthday treat and had the most wonderful experience here. From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty, there was not one detail that was missed; from the birthday plate and mini gifts, to the decorate your own cupcake and the kind and welcoming staff. I could not have wished for a better day, the service was absolutely impeccable. Thank you so much for making this day so wonderful!"
October 2019,Wonderful Experience,The old Victoria era in today's world  There is nothing negative to say about this hotel is a 5 star from rooms to service  Congratulations to the staff for making our stay a relax and enjoyable holiday
June 2019,brilliant hotel,"After passing by this hotel numerous times during trips to London as well as taking high tea in the lounge a few years earlier, we decided to book in to see if what we had built up in our minds was indeed the reality of it. In a nutshell, it was and so much more. The staff was wonderfully accommodating, kind and helpful from the moment we arrived until the last goodbye the following day. Our room was upgraded to a newly renovated suite, which was beautiful and very comfortable. No amenity was overlooked and we were treated like royalty. Drinks and appetizers in the bar were wonderfully innovative, delicious, and presented in a lovely way, as was breakfast the following day. Sadly, we only stayed one night but on our next visit, we plan to stay longer. If you are looking for a…"
October 2019,50th birthday and Silver Wedding Anniversary,"one of our best hotel experiences ever. service was superb. food  & cocktails delicious. their dining restaurant, chenestons, was a real discovery. afternoon tea was a delight. looking forward to our next visit."
October 2019,Now #1 on our list.,We had a joint celebration of my wife’s 50th birthday and our silver wedding anniversary and wanted to make it special. We were made to feel extremely welcome right from the start with a really nice glass of champagne before being taken to our room. There were many thoughtful touches in our room and in the hotel too numerous to mention during our four day stay. We are not exaggerating in saying this is probably the nicest hotel for quality of service and ambience we have ever stayed at.  Nothing was too much trouble. We are already planning our next break and we will be definitely be staying at this hotel again. Thank you for making our stay so memorable.
October 2019,Hotel Management At Its Finest,"We’ve been fortunate to stay in some memorable hotels, but the Milestone clearly notches in as our #1 choice.  Our stay was nine days in one of the multi-bedroom residences.  Unassuming from the exterior, the DNA of this well maintained, luxury hotel is absolutely first rate.  Most importantly, the staff from the doorman to the restaurant servers were friendly and helpful.  Their hospitality set the tone for entire visit.  The bedrooms had the standard items you would expect … sufficient lighting, multiple power outlets, ultra-clean bathroom, safe, thermostat on the wall, writing desk, firm mattress, and good linens.  Unexpected were the light dimmers, motorized curtains, and the blue, motion sensor controlled, overhead nightlight in the bath – a surreal experience.  Our…"
October 2019,"A beautiful, classic hotel.","I stayed at the Milestone from October 7th - 11th.  Let me first begin by stating that I have family in the hotel business in England--so I know a few things about how an English hotel should function successfully.  That being said, the Milestone is run very professionally, and the hallmark of all the staff is kindness.  I realize kindness doesn't usually correlate with ""professional,"" but the staff, here, shows genuine kindness in all of the verbal and offerings details that impacts one's stay.  The interior is immaculate.  The decor is gentleman;s club, but not stuffy.  The dining experience is the equivalent of any Michelin-starred London restaurant--thanks to the chefs, the wait staff, and the two fine maitres d'hotel, Messrs. Paolo and Augustin.  Mr. Ahuja is the best front…"
October 2019,The best 70th Birthday ever!,"The Milestone is like waking up in Downton Abbey where your staff is concerned about your happiness, health, comfort and satisfaction.  And, your staff is wonderful!  They even made me a birthday cake!  My travel mates and I are still talk about our delicious breakfasts and the kind, considerate service.  We highly recommend this hotel; it’s a great experience."
November 2019,Impressive Hotel in Every Aspect,"I’m not a huge fan of small or ‘boutique’ hotels.  Any type of descriptive label, deliberate or not, in my personal opinion is a euphemism for hiding a deficiency.  Not that Milestone advertises itself as a boutique hotel, and in fact does not come across as having this grandiose and pretentious air other hotels sometimes have.    Having had to change our plans from staying in Zurich to London instead, I found myself looking at last minute hotel availability in London.  With decent last-minute availability, numerous hotels came up and Milestone peaked my interest due to its location and great online reviews.  I was a little hesitant to book it due to its apparent small size (more on that later) and availability (as opposed to other hotels that were fully booked), but went ahead…"
November 2019,Great service and location,"First the great: the concierge and door men are awesome! They make you feel welcome and at home. The location is right across from Hyde Park. My only regret is I didn’t bring my cold weather running gear. Over our stay we had breakfast, tea, dinner, and drinks at the hotel and all were wonderful! I would say the tea was the best! Highly recommend!  The “ok”: The rooms are on the smaller side and although we had an upgrade with our credit card they couldn’t accommodate. The room service did a good job but she would pound on the door for turn down service while we were getting ready to go out. She would seem annoyed that we were still there.  All and all: the people, food, and location make this hotel 5 stars!"
November 2019,Impeccable service and generous hospitality (just as they promise).,"My wife and I stayed here on the first night of our honeymoon in 1969 before flying off to Portugal the following day. As we arrived at 9pm and left early the following morning we saw little of the hotel then and had always said we should stay there again one day. 50 years later, as part of our Golden Wedding celebrations this month, as I had booked for us to see Jools Holland at the Albert Hall, I thought I would book a two day stay at The Milestone. So, I contacted the hotel and arranged this as a surprise for my wife. I am so pleased I did (and, I’m pleased to say, so was my wife) as we both found the hotel to be well beyond any expectations we may have had. The location is, of course also excellent and convenient.  From the moment we arrived and the reception we received the…"
November 2019,Outstanding Hotel in London,"I recently stayed at The Milestone for a business trip for three nights.  This was my first stay at this hotel but had stayed previously at other Red Carnation hotels in the city and always had been impressed.  The Milestone didn’t let me down.  The hotel is located in a fantastic area across from the park.  The property is spotless and well maintained with common areas that make you feel like your at home and not in a hotel.  The room was absolutely wonderful, very comfortable and functional with a bathroom I fell in love with (I want the fixtures for my own home).  There was plenty of room to relax and work and the got a perfect night sleep.  Housekeeping was outstanding and everything was spotless my entire stay.  The amenities in the room were first class.  One of the main…"
October 2019,Felt Like Home,"I normally prefer the big fancy hotel chains, this hotel has changed that for me. Everyone knew my name almost immediately. My room felt like home. The bar is exactly what I’d dream up if I could design the perfect place to have a meal and glass of wine after a long day.  The breakfast, which was included, was incredible.  Perfectly located across the street from Kensington Palace, walking everyday in the park was a joy. Shopping all around. Can’t wait to return. "
July 2019,London getaway,"My wife and I stayed at the Milestone in mid July and had a wonderful experience.  The service was outstanding and I've stayed at plenty of hotels over the years. When we arrived we were greeted at the entrance by the staff who were gracious and attentive. We were given a tour of the hotel which I have never experienced at any other hotel. We were escorted by Fran to our room which was beautifully appointed and the staff left a handwritten card welcoming us to the hotel (very classy). The concierge staff were happy to set us up with tickets for any events we wanted to see. We had a wonderful meal(s) in the hotel restaurant. Champagne Afternoon Tea was a two hour event (a must). Also, we had a romantic turndown service which did not disappoint! When I London, stay at the…"
December 2018,Christmas in London,"The Milestone was lovely in every way. The staff makes one’s stay very personal. It’s a special charming hotel.Great location. Beautifully decorated. We loved gathering for a delicious breakfast everyday. Heading out to enjoy the city, and meeting again in the evening for a perfect cocktail in their little bar. We walked easily to shopping and dining in the neighborhood. We loved everything about the Milestone."
September 2019,Amazing hotel,"I only had the pleasure of staying here for one night as it was an anniversary celebration and we were going to a Proms concert at the Albert Hall and this hotel is about a 5 minute walk away. Stayed in the Meghan Suite. Amazing room, died and gone to heaven type of room. Separate dressing room, massive bathroom and the most comfortable bed. Treated like royalty. Nothing was too much trouble, fabulous staff and treatment. Called us all the time by our surname which made us feel special and it's little touches like this that make this hotel so fabulous. Great bar, great drinks, although we had clearly outstayed our welcome in the bar in the evening as the barman stopped the music, turned the lights on and started yawning.  It was 11.30pm, and we were the only ones in the bar so…"
July 2019,Fantastic F&B Experience - truly London's best hotel!!!,"I was lucky enough to experience the Milestone's Champagne Afternoon Tea with my partner. What an experience. From arrival, Steve the Doorman swiftly assisted with parking our car, even though we were not residents of the hotel, he personally introduced us to the F&B host by name, and they took us to our seat in the Park Lounge.  The Park Lounge is full of charm and character, the ideal setting for Afternoon Tea, with fantastic views of the Royal Kensington Gardens.  Sandra, our Host was ever so engaging, but knew her boundaries and wasn't 'over the top' - which is sometimes the case in top London Hotels. She was natural and seemed truly caring, whilst accommodating our needs efficiently.  The pastries and scones were to die for, and Sandra explained the flavors and options…"
August 2019,Afternoon tea birthday celebrations ,We visited as a family of 12 for afternoon tea for my husband’s birthday. The whole experience from booking to the actual event was flawless. Chloe was amazing accommodating the booking requirements and there were a few changes. Leo looked after us and nothing was too much trouble. Peggy was great when we left. The conservatory room was the perfect setting. The children loved the princess and prince tea and even got to decorate cakes. Thank you for making this an unforgettable birthday where the professionalism and care was top notch. The venue was beautiful and the staff are a credit to this venue. 
August 2019,Outstanding service and location in London,"We recently travelled to London and stayed at this charming hotel in Kensington. The staff was outstanding and went well beyond our expectations to make our trip special. The concierge desk was amazing and very helpful, all of the recommendations were spot on. The breakfast was delicious and staff was most accommodating. Our room was beautiful and impeccably cleaned everyday. It was the highlight of out trip to London and we will certainly go back."
July 2019,Friendliest Staff and Amazing Hospitality,"We stayed as a family of 4 adults and 4 children first in the three bedroom residence and then in three hotel rooms. We Have traveled many times to London and stayed at top hotels in the world but Milestone Customer Service comes definitely on the top of the list. Each request on the guest preference form was fulfilled. Each room is designed uniquely and has very posh interiors, high quality beddings and top notch toiletries. The location is close to Museums and Kensington Palace. The breakfast is superb variety and delicious. They even arranged an Indian Veg menu for our family breakfast. The afternoon tea is a must try. The concierge team goes out of the way to assist. Special mention for Blake Sur from Reservations, Tara from Reception and Vanja from Breakfast team. Can’t…"
July 2019,Highly Expensive but it worth for this experience,Expensive but really beautiful hotel in London. Beautiful rooms equipped with every comfort with huge double beds with balcony. Fantastic bathroom with all the necessities. Buffet breakfast to make the double banquets envious. Very nice swimming pool Great service and staff. In front of the structure there are many restaurants
August 2019,5-Star Birthday Weekend,"As a frequent traveler for both work and pleasure, I have had the opportunity to stay at many 5-star properties globally...nothing quite compares to this one! I was blown away by the staff and how not a detail went unnoticed - truly a 5-star experience! I recommend booking a picnic in Hyde Park (across the street) if you have the opportunity during this seasonal offer. It was a delight and the staff again were super accommodating. I will definitely return to this hotel - which I will call my new home in London - very soon!"
July 2019,Fourth Fabulous Milestone Visit from USA,"The Milestone is the essence of English style and graciousness.  Location superb (across from Kensington Palace and Embassy Row), Rooms are elegant (recently renovated with amazing bathrooms on par with Plaza NYC), and Tea in the conservatory is the Best in London.  But what brings us back “home” Again and Again is the staff......a dream team of hospitality experts focused on YOU.  Our favorite server, Grant, has consistently gone above and beyond to enhance our hotel experience—-even to have Chef “whip up” a fresh batch of scones for the kids at 10 PM.  In concierge, Jose and Giacamo are well respected in the city, getting us dinner reservations impossible, even scoring front row theater tickets 1 hr before a show.  This week we received a box from Anna in housekeeping, my…"
July 2019,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!!","I connected with Katie through the website when I discovered the Wimbledon package offered by The Milestone.  This was a year in advance!  Katie and others patiently emailed me through planning our trip - firming up dates, making reservations, etc. Everything was fabulous. Fran greeted us and gave us a brief tour of the hotel. Teddy took care of our bags. Natalia helped us at the desk and was also the last person we spoke to upon our sad departure. Antonio helped us several times at our meals - including the amazing Afternoon Tea!  Thomas, the bartender, was so attentive to learn and call us by name. And this is how we were catered to throughout. An absolutely lovely experience.  Clearly many of the guests routinely experience this kind of service, but for us, it was a…"
June 2019,Charming Luxury with Outstanding Service,"My family of 4 recently stayed at Milestone Hotel during a trip to London. We had originally booked two rooms but when we arrived we had been upgraded to a residence which had two bedrooms, a living room, kitchen and two bathrooms. The hotel is in a great location in Kensington, opposite the Kensington Palace and a short walk to the tube station. It is a boutique style hotel with very traditional English decor and perhaps one of the most charming breakfast/dining rooms I have ever been in. So pretty but having teenage boys, I could not get them to agree to take any pictures in there. We were very happy with the accommodation, the quality of the fixtures and linens but more than that, the service in the hotel is outstanding. Every person we encountered went out of their way to…"
June 2019,Uncompromised Service Excellence,The staff was memorable. The tea was perfect. The sleep was peaceful. The environment was dreamy.  My team stayed there on a business trip. We began the sessions with exceptional tea and ended them with brilliantly mixed cocktails.  I will never forget my time at the Milestone and will only stay there on future trips to London.  -Nick Ace
June 2019,Anniversary stay -best anywhere ever !!,"Stayed 2 nights as a couple and can only say this was an indulgent treat from start to finish - quite honestly best hotel experience ever ! The hotel is priced higher than we would normally pay however worth every penny . The rooms are individual and stylish in a luxurious way - the dining experience at dinner and breakfast faultless - special mention to Paulo . Food in Chenestons restaurant superb ! However have to mention the Service from staff was unrivalled - all staff from Reception , Concierge , Restaurant and Bar simply could not do enough for us. Location is excellent - I would not hesitate to strongly recommend - cannot wait to go back"
June 2019,The Elegant Hôtel.,"A dear friend recommended the Milestone hotel for our stay in London.  The minute I entered the hotel lobby I felt in love with it. It’s so elegant, full of art pieces and quite.plus it smelled like roses. I was not disappointed at all. I loved the cleanliness, decor, quietness and the lovely restaurant and bar ( the breakfast was so good ) and I had dinner and their lovely restaurant and it was very good. The people working in this hotel are so sweet, friendly, at your service and professional. I would highly recommend this hotel for couples who appreciate the classic English Decor and love ❤️ art work. Thank you 😊 Milestone team for making my visit so memorable.   Maha Alatta.   KSA, JEDDAH  June 2019"
June 2019,"Very polite, professional, kind staff",We stayed at the Milestone for three days and it was nothing short of excellent. We loved our vacation and the staff was especially kind and easy to talk to. Breakfast was wonderful and afternoon tea was excellent. We would love to stay here again!
June 2019,FANTASTIC HOTEL ON EVERY LEVEL!!,"My husband and I spent three nights at the Milestone, and I wish we could have stayed longer. It’s an older, traditional English hotel, and every single staff member that we encountered made us feel like very welcomed guests.  The room was lovely, beautifully appointed with every possible amenity, and the bed was comfortable, too. The turn down service provided wonderful surprises each night!  The breakfasts were huge and fantastic! There was a lovely buffet of fish, cheeses, cereals, fruit, breads and pastries...and then there were full hot choices to go along with that! Everything was served so beautifully, and the staff really aimed to please.  A wonderful experience."
June 2019,The best,"After the long trip to London we were incredibly happy to arrive at the Milestone and find such an amazing  hotel. We were welcomed so warmly, given hot tea, and personally escorted to our room. The food was fantastic and you'll never find a more inviting and charming little bar. The location is perfect and we were able to get around London with ease from there. We cannot recommend it more highly and from our experience it blows away the larger and more well know hotels in the city. We will go back for sure."
June 2019,A Gem in Kensington,"This was our second stay at this lovely hotel. The service staff are all lovely and provide excellent, friendly service. Our room was lovely and cool and we were given a welcome drink. My car was valet-parked by Steve the doorman who also hailed a taxi for us when we wanted to go out. We stayed here as it is only a few minutes walk to the Royal Albert Hall where we were going to a concert. The breakfast is great : a buffet of cold items and cooked-to-order breakfasts. We both had the full English breakfast which was outstanding with eggs cooked any way, a delicious sausage, black pudding, bacon, tomatoes and mushrooms....and bubble & squeak! This is a super comfortable hotel to which we will return."
June 2019,Sheer perfection!!,"Exceptional service and uncompromising attention to detail! We loved every moment of our holiday there, and cannot wait to return! Special thanks to Steve for his lovely pub recommendation and to the team at the Stables Bar for their relentless pursuit of perfecting my favorite amaretto sour. The concierge desk also assisted with my needs for a last minute hostess gift, an emergency fix for my husbands broken glasses, and I could keep going with how helpful they were at every turn. Well done, well done indeed."
June 2019,Best Hotel anywhere,"You will not find better service anywhere than here at the Milestone, just across the street from Kensington Palace. The rooms are all decorated differently, very quaint, with fabric on the walls. Everyone in the hotel is extremely friendly and helpful. We called for coffee in our room, and it came in about 5 minutes. The concierge recommended two excellent restaurants for us. This was our second time staying here, and it will not be the last. Would not stay in any other hotel in London. Highly recommended!"
June 2019,Unbelievable experience!,"A wonderful place to stay.  Enjoyed the rooms and the food!  Service was exceptional.  The staff including Mr. Nik, specifically, was simply amazing.  We even took a photo with the door man.  He was so funny!  Sorry, forgot his name.  The location is fabulous and you can walk to Kensington Palace, Hyde Park and many other attractions.  Enjoyed the walk around that area which is a lot more quieter.  It also about 2 min. walk to the London Tube's Kensington station.  Lots of shopping options around the hotel too.  The evening tea experience was out of the ordinary.  Might want to dress a bit formal but not mandated.  One has to experience it at least once in their lifetime!"
June 2019,Milestone Hotel 6 Star services,"Have traveled the World and stayed in the best places, but this hotel and its staff was above 5 star. we had a mix up with one of our bags and it was left at the port and the Concierge handled the entire situation expertly, efficiently, and politely"
June 2019,Ship to shore,"We ended our 12 day cruise in Southampton and were looking for a central London hotel to transition back to dry land.  The Milestone was the perfect spot.  Located across from the park in Kensington the hotel, provided convenience, comfort but most of all impeccable service.  We arrived mid morning and wanted to maximize our short stay in London.  The room was still being serviced so the staff gave us a key to the spa where we freshened up before heading out.  Room was prepared and bags delivered.  The Milestone is a grand old hotel, with modern conveniences.  The staff is first rate.  And the complimentary cookies are outstanding"
June 2019,The Milestone is special!,"And what makes it so special is the lovely, hard-working staff who exude enthusiasm and exert every effort to assist and please their guests. The neighborhood is fabulous as well as you are central enough to all with the quaintness and charm of the Kensington neighborhood. Our room was spacious and comfortable with every amenity- great products, linen, shower, etc. We loved enjoying an evening cocktail at The Stable bar- (Thanks Angelo and company!) The breakfast is beautiful with lots of choices and we had room service deliver our morning coffee at our request each day. We overheard another guest say that they've stayed at many places in London and now only return to The Milestone and we can understand why."
May 2019,Back again,We stayed in the Royal Studio for 8 nights. The place deserves its high rating. Spacious and elegant. Well trained staff. Excellent location. Can’t wait go back. Convenient to Tube. You will not be disappointed.
May 2019,Only the Best for You,"I'll start with the thing that will make you come back every time you are in London.  Every single person in this hotel wants to make your stay perfect.  They do not make you ask; they ask you!  When it comes to the room, there is just nothing they seem to forget.  With Breakfast added you won't have to eat again for the day!  Superlatives could not do it justice.  You must go to The Milestone yourself.  They will not let you down.  Enjoy the room, enjoy all the little extras, experience afternoon Tea and having a drink in the bar is a cozy romantic must.  Everywhere you turn they provide service with warmth and the pleasant satisfaction that they know how to do it and know you are having a wonderful stay.  I could go on and on.  My wife and I will go back to London just to stay…"
May 2019,Wonderful Wedding Anniversary,"My wife and I had a wonderful Wedding Anniversary for 30 guests in The Windsor Suite.The food and wine were delicious , the flowers beautiful and with friendly , efficient staff the evening was a huge success . Thank you Suzie and Team Milestone !"
May 2019,wonderful boutique hotel,"My first impression wasn't that great.  I didn't love the room first.  My husband requested a quiet room, and that's what we got.  The room was on the top floor overlooking a courtyard.  The windows were smallish and  the ceiling rather low. But the bed was wonderfully comfortable, and it was very quiet, indeed. Every night we received really nice goodies on our pillows.  The stuff was wonderful - not snotty but warm and personable. Breakfast was just outstanding!  One of the best breakfasts we ever had.  The pancakes and french toast were simply outstanding, so were the smoked fish in the buffet and yogurt.  And last but not least was our breakfast waitress .  I think her name was Eleonora.  She lit up every morning with her smile and warmth.  The rooms where breakfast was…"
May 2019,Fantastic On All Counts!,"We recently spent three nights at the Milestone and I wish it had been more. We stayed in the Princess Suite which was just lovely with its French balcony. The bathroom, linens, toiletries, and bedding were all luxurious. There were also some charming extra touches like little snacks every night and printed social cards. The breakfast was more than generous. The hotel is a very charming boutique hotel. What really stood out was the staff. We had a great time with the bartenders who not only mix great cocktails but are also great conversationalists. The concierge staff was excellent and very helpful even before we arrived. When we needed something (e.g. laundry pick up), the staff showed up immediately. Needless to say, the Milestone has become our go-to hotel in London. "
April 2019,Always five stars,"I have stayed at the Milestone on multiple occasions, on business and pleasure and with family and by myself.  The location,rooms and amenities are excellent.  The staff are the best.  They go out of their way to look after you and make your stay memorable.  If you want personalized attention, responsiveness and an overall great experience choose the Milestone."
March 2019,Best Value in Town,i went with a friend and stayed at the Milestone for 5 nights!!! yes it might be more than you would usually pay But what you get for your money is far above the less expensive hotels. just the quality of the people and their willingness to help and be accommodating is worth the price of admission. Jose & his concierge crew are really priceless. they assisted us in getting play tickets and restaurant reservations and recommendations (which were right on the money) i got home and couldn't stop telling my husband how wonderful our stay was at the Milestone. the breakfasts-the beautiful bar-the pickup service from and to the airport- and on & on--Now my husband is upset he didn't come too!! treat yourself and stay here-- great location as well!!!
March 2019,Very good but there are areas for improvement. Overpriced for what you pay for. It certainly wouldn’t be my perfect hote,"The hotel, the staff, the restaurant were excellent the room service was appalling. The hotel was very good, the reception with the the exception of one girl whose English was not good were excellent. The bar staff, the restaurant staff, the housekeeping staff were all excellent, however on arrival we were offered coffee etc. We accepted the coffee as we were unpacking our clothes etc however after half an hour after unpacking our coffee still had not arrived. We rang and requested the coffee be delivered to the bar finally after about ten minutes the coffee arrived in the bar. On Saturday evening after having a few drinks in the bar we went to our room and requested coffee in our room again we were told it was going to be about 45 minutes. - Not acceptable!! It was 11.00pm on…"
March 2019,The perfect stay,"This small but “perfectly formed” hotel provides home from home luxury. Personal & friendly, with the correct amount of professionalism. An oasis of calm & style. We cannot recommend it highly enough."
March 2019,Wonderful hotel! Great location!,"I had the wonderful opportunity to spend several nights at this splendid hotel. I have stayed at some of the more well known top end hotels in London that all know, but it was my first time to stay at a Red Carnation branded botique hotel. The Milestone is very cozy and the treatment from arrival to exit is as a family member.  I love the little touches, a candle in the bath  when you return in the evening, the dragons on the sill in the breakfast (at night fine dining) room, the delicious freshly baked cookings when check in. But the real treat is the engaging and friendly staff, who welcome you heartily and make you feel at home from the moment you arrive with the doorman, to the friendly and personalized check in, to the very kind and thorough concierge team that can set up…"
March 2019,The best hotel of our trip!,"On a recent trip to London, Oxford and the Cotswolds, we had the pleasure to stay at The Milestone. It was by far our favorite hotel of this trip! The service was outstanding, the hotel was well appointed and the food was excellent. I recommend it highly."
March 2019,Wonderful Experience,"I had a four nights stay three weeks ago with my family. We enjoyed the best level of deluxe studio in all services. perfect in food and beverage (beautiful scene every night), specially tea hour, typical english. Very good international staff. It seemed a dream..."
October 2018,Fantasic Hotel,"fantastic hotel !!!  This was the best hotel ever.  it was brilliant,  luxurious and it was so clean and tidy.   the staff was fantastic and friendly.   I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone.  What a not great holiday"
March 2019,Afternoon Tea with Children,"My friend and I had afternoon tea with our young daughters while we were visiting London.  The staff was incredibly welcoming and treated our girls like princesses.  The tea selection was wonderful and the food was delicious.  The atmosphere and location were perfect and charming, exactly what we'd hoped for.  When we visit London again, I wouldn't hesitate to return!  I highly recommend an afternoon at The Milestone Hotel!"
January 2019,Outstanding property located directly,"Outstanding property located directly across from Kensington Gardens. The entire staff was simply incredible... made us feel at home and welcome... quick with a ‘hello’ and a smile... and always accommodating. If we could rate the staff and 11, we would"
August 2019,Birthday weekend at The Milestone,"I travel extensively through work, designing bespoke wardrobe for fine hotels around the world.  We stay at fine properties and meet excellent staff in many hotels. That said, The Milestone stands above all in the effortless sincerity of the staff and their attention to every detail. I cannot put into better verbiage the Impeccable service and friendly disposition that made us feel at home. From the beautifully decorated rooms, each unique, to the Stables bar, to the Butler service picnic in the park....I will be back!"
August 2019,Awesome Hotel,"We've stayed here 4 times in the past 3 yrs.  Hotel is beautiful, rooms are all different and very clean.  Some are typical Euro small rooms, but all we've seen are adequate and with King beds.  Full, cozy bar with excellent, creative bartenders.  Breakfast added to your room rate is worth it.  Onsite restaurant & room service are excellent as well.  (Try the Pot Pie).  The Milestone Staff:  I would give them a 6 out of a 5-Star rating as ALL of them go above and beyond normal expectations.  Trust them to help you with theater, dining and attraction recommendations/reservations.  We usually  take more home than we bring and they're great at shipping whatever doesn't fit in our carry-on luggage back to the US.  Highly recommend The Milestone."
April 2019,London hotel,Lot of hustle bustle with loads of tourists. Stayed there just one night after booking via a hotel app......reasonable. Breakfast was not included but restaurants are reasonable and bar prices are okay for London.
July 2019,Paradise,I booked the hotel for its location and was blown away from the time Steve took our car until he handed it back some three days later. Service was outstanding - décor amazing - quality of food and drink superb - staff exceptional - rooms spacious and luxurious - we seriously thought we had arrived in paradise - have to say a special mention to Steve who greeted us - parked our car and returned it safely and acted as our guide for whatever we wanted.  This will be the first of many visits - Thank you all so much
July 2019,Blown away,"My wife and I travel a lot and only stay at 5-star hotels. Out of all the hotels we have been to in the past, including various Aman properties - which are regarded to be the best in the world - the Milestone Hotel has blown our minds in terms of service quality. From Steve the legendary doorman up to the lovely housekeeping ladies, the front desk staff, concierge, barmen....everyone is so incredibly friendly and kind. This really stood out. The rooms are comfortable, the premises very oldskool but nicely upkept. The Spa is tiny but fine for a city hotel. But the service quality tops anything I have ever experienced, especially in the UK. We were stranded in the UK due to bad weather and were not exactly in the best mood, but the moment we arrived at the Milestone things changed…"
July 2019,Best Hotel Stay in London,"My husband and I stayed on a friends recommendation. It was so lovely and such wonderful staff that we stayed there again, a few weeks later.    Attention to amazing details, makes us want to come back. I loved all the special little things that they do... from precious notes and nice gifts of tea or cookies!   Room upgrades and a great concierge who is a generous wealth of information."
July 2019,21st birthday celebration,"Wow, wow, wow... sadly we have just left the Milestone Hotel following another visit. If you like to go unnoticed (or cared about) in a hotel, then do not stay here. The Milestone is for people who want to feel special ( that does not mean that the service is intrusive). The staff are incredible and make you feel valued and welcomed, each and every one of them.  We have stayed here and at other Carnation hotels. All are great but the Milestone just has something extra special and that is exactly what we wanted for our daughter on her 21st  birthday.  The suites are different styles but both of ours were stunning. Such comfortable beds and pillows, quiet rooms with unobtrusive air conditioning. Sparkling bathrooms with lots of lovely Penhaligon lotions and potions. Great bar…"
July 2019,Milestone hotel,"I do not consider this hotel as five star hotel Great location fabulous breakfast Furniture in the room were old and rusty On the first day we arrived early and we were very tired asked them if they had a room ready they did not say yes or no Keep saying shortly... we waited from 930 to 1 pm We did not mind to get an answer yes or no but they were so unclear My son also found a hair in his breakfast Barely got an apology Beside the receptionists the rest of the service were great twice a day housekeeping  The location is great close to park, train,.. "
July 2019,Charming and superb!,"Fabulous welcome at check-in - included mini tour of the property.  I was extremely late because of traffic and needed a shirt rapidly ironed - this was immediately taken care of.  The room was extremely comfortable with excellent toiletries provided by Penhaligon's.  Bar extremely welcoming, with complementary glass of champagne on the house.  Unfortunately I arrived rather late and left very early to catch my flight, however, I saw enough to very much want to return!"
July 2019,Superior London Hotel,"We stayed at the Milestone Hotel for three nights.  The experience was outstanding.  If you want a definite English hotel experience this is a place to go.  The staff is attentive, thoughtful and caring.  Service was superior.  The rooms are well equipped with modern conveniences.  We could not be happier with our experience and would recommend this hotel without hesitation."
March 2019,Anniversary Trip,"My husband and I stayed at this extraordinary hotel for 3 nights for an early 30th anniversary trip.  I cannot say enough for the caliber of the staff, from the doorman, housekeepers, front desk and the great concierge staff.  From the minute we stepped into the hotel we were greeted by name.  Mathilda at the front desk was lovely and promised to provided restaurant suggestions for us on our trip to Paris.  On the morning of our check out we found them under our door.  Each day we were left a delicious treat at night.  The highlight were cupcakes made for my husband to commemorate his attendance at a Manchester United match we planned to attend.  I can’t think of any other hotel that has gone above and beyond like the Milestone.  We also loved  Timothy the concierge and his…"
March 2019,Afternoon Tea,"We had afternoon tea here and it was delightful. The staff treated our children like royalty, the food was delicious, and the atmosphere was unbeatable. The location is in the heart of Kensington, which is such a beautiful spot in London. Right across the street from Kensington Palace. Will definitely book here again!!"
July 2018,How it should be everywhere,"Excellent on quality, service etc. Never failing I have now been here twice with my wife without kids and you feel welcomed. Every question is answered to your satisfaction, concierge is great , everything spot on. The whole red carnation group is to be preferred above the big chain hotels. That is off course If you want a charming old school english high quality personalized hotel experience. Thanks for having us and we will be back again. "
April 2018,"A lovely and surprising extension of great personal care by hotel, to guests","I was first at the Milestone in the 1970's, at which time it was not a luxurious hotel, as it is now, rather it was a solid entity, on the #9 Bus route, which would bring you to the center of the city. Across the street are the Kensington Gardens, where Harry and Meghan reside. The milestone now has similar amenities that more famous named and more expensive hotels towards the center of the city.  A good and comfortable place to stay, the presence of a hall porter, a restaurant on premises, and if I remember correctly, a typical ""English breakfast"" offered.  Interesting experience"
February 2019,Beautiful hotel,"Have just returned from a quick one night stay at this lovely hotel. The staff were all exceptionally helpful and friendly and really couldn’t do enough to make your stay enjoyable.   The hotel is truly beautiful, everywhere spotlessly clean and decorated and furnished grandly. Our room had a lovely view over the park. It was furnished beautifully but all the furniture was quite large and took up a lot of floor space which did make it a little cramped. Also the bed, which although very comfortable was extremely high making it quite difficult for my petite mum to get on and off easily without some help. However the very many thoughtful touches and the lovely large bathroom with a plentiful supply of toiletries made it a very comfortable and pleasant stay.   "
February 2019,Magnificent Experience,"First of all, I must admit I am biased to spending time in the RCH Collection of hotels as each has it's own distinct and glamorous experience.  I was staying at Summer Lodge in Evershot and met a lovely couple who recommended the Milestone and I had yet to stay there so I was able to make a reservation at the last minute and the last room and I was so delighted for so many reasons.  It was truly a priviledge to be able to spend two nights at this magnificent hotel with the finest doorman I have ever met who welcomes you with open arms and then you are whisked away to reception where Noola and Tara are there to greet you with warmth and  friendly hospitality.   The team makes you immediately feel at home and nothing is too small or large for them to accommodate. They are so…"
February 2019,A London Gem,"I recently had the opportunity to stay at The Milestone Hotel in London. Having heard about it I was eager to experience to for myself. Located in Kensington, going forward The Milestone Hotel will be my go to property in London. Each and every member of the staff knows your name and the service they deliver is superb. Greeted upon arrival by the Bellmen Stephen or Patrizio, we were made to feel like we had arrived home.  The Concierge Desk is the most professional I have ever worked with and they are indeed knowledgeable about the all things London whether it be transportation, dining or theatre. Shout out to Giacomo, Jose and Timothy( I hope I haven't forgotten anyone). Each morning we were greeted in the dining room by Eleanor who went out of her way to make sure we were…"
February 2019,A Royal Palace well beyond expectations!,"When I generally go to a hotel with a very high ranking, I simply expect that something has to go wrong as I generally believe the grading of my fellow travellers to be way too generous, instead my preconception went completely wrong with Milestone! Everything from the booking, to the special requests, the stay, the staff, the room, the view, the breakfast in the room, the sauna and the gym, all  was simply stunning and perfect!!!! I have no words a just felt like a royal myself! Anyway trying to be a bit managerial and a little bit less carried on by the emotions, I think this management has taken the strategic choice to have a higher number than average of staff and that has as a  first consequence the ability to deliver such a spotless service!  More importantly everybody is…"
January 2019,Special gem of hotel,Wonderful celebration stay at this gem of a hotel in central London!  The team were so helpful and the room was just lovely and comfortable - we all had a fabulous time and night out at the Royal Albert Hall - just along the road - seeing cirque de soleil Totem - very special experience for all - just 10/10 ! 
February 2019,Valentines ,"My other half booked us a night here to celebrate Valentine’s Day ;) wd went to see cirque du Soleil .... ( not their best show ) but it didn’t matter as the hotel was exquisite !! Room was fabulous , best hotel bed we’ve ever stayed in ... just immaculate with gorgeous decor and crisp sheets ... decor was of high standard throughout and the staff are amazing !! Can’t fault a thing . We will be back but for longer than a night !! Great location !! Highly recommend. "
May 2019,Favorite Hotel in England,We returned for a second stay in last 6 months last week. We usually never stay at a hotel twice as we like new experiences but will choose the Milestone every time we return to London. Staff is simply amazing as are the accommodations and location.
May 2019,Elegant Hospitality,"Walking into the Milestone is like breathing hospitality.You feel like you're staying in an elegant Victorian home.They anticipate all the things that make for a lovely stay - the aroma that greets you at the door, remembering your name, a lighted candle on your tub at night, different treats at bedtime, and wrapping your charging cords to name a few. They answer, ""Of course we can do that"" to any request. I especially enjoyed chatting with Thomas at the bar one evening - well done!"
January 2019,visited the bar at this historic hotel,My daughter and I randomly went into this hotel to have a refreshing gin and tonic- what a treat it was. The bar has a horse racing motif. The service was excellent and the drinks excellent. They were a bit pricey but hey you only live once!
May 2019,Personal Experience make the difference!,"The Milestone ‘has it all’, with great location, food, and appointments... but the quality we most appreciated was the staff.  Whether it was the concierge service or Thomas in the bars, people knocked themselves out to make our stay memorable and stress-free.  We’ll surely return!"
May 2019,Well cared for ,"I can not say enough good things about this hotel. I would never stay anywhere else in London. Not only is the hotel beautiful and In an excellent location but it’s the staff that make you feel welcome and cared for.  Our trip was riddled with airport cancellations, lost important baggage and an event that had tickets delivered prior to our arrival. They changed our reservations easily to accommodate or day late arrival. Greeted us when we checked in with such kindness and caring. When luggage was lost the whole staff stepped in to help us. They went above and beyond in assisting us.  Besides the amazing staff and location, the amenities were wonderful. The fitness center, pool, restaurant on site, bar, were enjoyed. The treats in the room were delicious.  I can not thank the…"
April 2019,Best stay in London ,"This boutique hotel is next to the Kensington Palace and has a long history. The decorations are tasteful and also have clear but subtle connection to London itself, including sketches out the Matisse era and paintings of horse racing and tennis game. Occasionally the royal family may come to afternoon tea or dinner. The service is excellent and the concierge desk was very friendly and truly wanting you to have a good time. They helped us planned most of our activities during our stay. The afternoon tea was the best, period. We also enjoyed the daily breakfast - the variety, quality, and service all made a top experience. It’s a place we want to go back again. We had a studio room featuring Matisse sketches and paintings. Everything contributed to an experience that is rich in…"
May 2019,Afternoon tea experience ,"I enjoyed Afternoon tea as solo traveler and what can I say - staff was very welcoming and caring, atmosphere and interior send me a few centuries back in the past and created a needed feeling, and the tea, sandwiches and all sweet cakes were excellent, only problem - too much to try everything 😊"
April 2019,Milestone Hotel WOW!!!,"Son got married in hotel, fantastic service, rooms outstanding. Could not ask for better. Staff so pleasant and helpful. Organisation was perfect from start to finish. Food also outstanding. love the ambience of the hotel rather than ultra modern. Highly recommend this hotel for anyone of any age. Hotel staff and organiser made the perfect day for our son and guests, nothing was too much trouble. Rooms amazing all the facilities needed where there."
December 2018,Best Hotel in London,"We were warmly greeted at the front lobby, and escorted to our fabulous room.  The staff heard we were celebrating my wife's birthday so they laid red rose petals in the shape of a heart on the bed cover, and supplied the room with sweets prepared on site.  Every night upon our return from touring London, we stopped in the intimate cocktail lounge staffed by the gregarious and talented barkeep mixoligist Giorgio and the attentive waiter Giacomo.  Ask for his special cocktail: ""Remember the Maine"" and he will explain the significance of each ingredient.   You will be for  a treat if you are lucky enough to try their afternoon High Tea.  Talk about a high society experience.... Wow.  One night we had reservations to see Phantom of the Opera at Her Majesty's Royal Theater…"
December 2018,"Excellent stay in warm, friendly and charming environment","I stayed at the Milestone Hotel in late December celebrating my wife’s 60th birthday. We had stayed here a few times over the last decade. We were pleased to see that the standards of service have remained extremely high over the years.  I just love this hotel. There is a great ambience about this hotel - warm and friendly in a charming environment.  The major point of difference  for me is the high level of staff service - friendly, polite and professional!  The rooms are all unique and very comfortable with all the required amenities! The attention to detail is superb.  The breakfast is excellent with a wide variety of choices. The dinner I had on one night was OK but I would recommend eating out somewhere else as London has such choice available.  I did not use gym and spa…"
December 2018,Great visit...again,"We really enjoy the hotel.  The food is quite good and the service is good.  Housekeeping is immaculate and the facility is very well maintained.  I think breakfast has lost a little of its ""english charm"" as the service is not as good as it once was but the food is good, especially the full english breakfast and we had to use room service because of early tours and it was on-time and very well prepared and served.  We have stayed here four or five times and will again."
January 2019,"One week trip to London, filled with sight seeing and exploring.","Our stay at the Milsetone Hotel exceeded our expectations! The entire staff was so welcoming and helpful. The Concierge staff was superb. Our room was comfortable and very well appointed.  Breakfast each morning was perfect with a wide assortment. We had dinner one night at the hotel and it was a delicious meal with exceptional service. The location of the hotel was a definite plus. We were within short walking distance to the underground railway, nice restaurants, shopping, Hyde Park and Kensington Palace We recommend this highly and are looking  forward to going back. We cannot say enough positive about the Milestone Hotel and they way we were treated."
December 2018,Magical!,"We stayed here for a week over the Christmas period. Truly a magical stay. The hotel per se is lovely but it is the service which makes it world class. The whole staff goes the extra mile to make your stay a memorable one. Special mention to the bar staff.  Rooms are of high standard, food is excellent, gym/spa area is small but functional. Lots of little treats such as chocolate were offered to us each day, and we also received Christmas presents! Thanks to all and can’t wait to be back! "
January 2019,"Great Hotel, Outstanding Staff and Incredible Location!","We stayed at The Milestone Hotel from 22-26 December for a Christmas break in London and the facility and staff truly exceeded our expectations. The hotel's location, directly across from Kensington Gardens, was incredibly convenient. Our room (305) was spacious, quiet and very comfortable (kudos for one of the best hotel mattresses we've ever experienced). Hats off to Steve, Pedro, Magda, Patricio, Raul, Mathilde, Tara and the rest of the Milestone team for making us feel incredibly welcome and 'at home' during our stay."
December 2018,"Cozy, Convenient, and Convivial","A small hotel on High Street Kensington on the southwest edge of Kensington Gardens offers convenience to the parks, tube station, and posh shopping.  The atmosphere is more like ""home"" than ""hotel.""  Yes, rooms are small by American standards, but more than adequate and are in excellent condition. The service staff are very friendly, responsive, and attentive.  For example, I bought a book, laid it on my bedside table - the turn down service inserted a Milestone bookmark for my convenience.  Each evening a new taste treat was laid on our pillows.  A newspaper started each day. During our stay we both had a bout of stomach bug - the staff responded with medications, ginger ale and ice without our asking.  The restaurant and bar have a strong menu for such a small property.  We…"
December 2018,Fantastic hotel and staff,Gorgeous afternoon tea home made scones and pastries. Fab choice of teas and lanson champagne all in a stunning setting next to Kensington palace what more can you ask for! Restaurant looks smashing too. 
December 2018,"Beautiful Hotel, Amazing Service",My family and I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights. The hotel is immaculate and the staff are wonderful .  The breakfast was great !  We felt as though we were home being away from home .The rooms are decorated with beautiful Furniture and drapes . The bed linens were wonderful  as well as the bath towels. I have traveled to many places and this is the nicest hotel I have been in . The location is great . The staff was always there to help in anyway .  I would highly recommend “The milestone “!  They also have a small resistance pool in the work out area . My 6 year old granddaughter loved it . You were able to turn on the resistance button or Keep  it as a regular pool.  I would look into this hotel if you  are planning  on going to London L.B  from New Jersey .
April 2019,Amazing stay,"The Milestone Hotel sets a high standard for service anywhere in the world.   From the person at the door when you arrive with your luggage, who actually seems to be expecting you, to the women who beautifully clean the rooms and leave treats on your bedside, we felt warmly welcomed and pampered by all.  We stayed in standard rooms, which were a nice size and had every amenity you could need.   My request for adjacent rooms was accommodated with no problem.  The beds were very comfortable.  The hotel is in an excellent location, right across from the park and near several Tube stations.  I will definitely return to the Milestone Hotel."
March 2019,Beautiful afternoon tea ,"We stayed here to celebrate our Silver Anniversary. We where very lucky in receiving an upgrade, which was a beautiful split level suit. We attended an event at The Royal Albert Hall, and on returning, spent some time in the bar, then when returning to our room it had the most beautiful romantic turndown, candles and rose petals everywhere. Breakfast amazing, and we dined in the restaurant one evening, which was lovely, great food and staff very friendly. The following two nights of turndowns, where more simple, just a couple of chocolates in a bag on the bed. The only minor niggle, which we didn't report, was that we used a tall tumbler for water on the first day, it disappeared and we never saw it again! Our 2nd night, we had scones left in the room, and while the napkins…"
December 2018,Great service but spa disappointing ,Old fashioned charm of an English Hotel. It was very cold in London when I visited and the down stairs area were not warm. The Spa area is a disappointment and the bar was small and quirky. The service and friendliness of the staff was memorable. 
January 2019,Fantastic experience,"We stayed for one night at this  lovely hotel as we were visiting the Albert Hall for a show. It was a straight, easy, flat 10 minute walk from this hotel. It’s a great location just opposite the wonderful Kensington palace and park. Our room was pleasant even though the decor was a little dated and we faced the back not the park. The small gift and the box of biscuits were a nice touch. The bathroom was very well done and the bed very comfortable.We were very impressed with the young and enthusiastic staff who looked after us so well during our stay. We particularly felt the bar staff were so professional and pleasant when we went for pre show drinks. Later on  when we arrived with our family after the show  there was a lone barman . He was both knowledgeable charming and…"
April 2019,The Best Stay,"The Sabrage experience was amazing followed by a superb lunch, all of the staff were great but David went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed the whole experience.  Just fantastic day out, if you get chance to do this please do"
April 2019,Service with a smile,"We were privileged to stay at the Milestone for five days during our visit to London. The staff is professional, super friendly, and extremely well trained--whether at the front desk, at tea, in the restaurant, at the bar, the doorman, concierge and housekeeping staff. We were so well taken care of, we didn't want to leave. Our junior suite room was clean, plenty spacious with a view of Kensington Palace and the park"
April 2019,Perfect,"Couldn’t fault either the accommodation or the catering, but we were particularly aware that the smiles which accompanied the service were perfectly genuine and could not just be a requirement of a 5* hotel."
April 2019,"""Royal Treatment""","This was the best hotel ever.  it was brilliant,  luxurious and it was so clean and tidy.   the staff was fantastic and friendly. Outstanding property located directly across from Kensington Gardens. The entire staff was simply incredible... made us feel at home and welcome... quick with a ‘hello’ and a smile... and always accommodating. "
April 2019,Great Experience,A long overdue thank you to the amazing staff at The Milestone Hotel.  Visited with my Mom for a wedding and we were given the royal treatment to make us feel special. Would recommend highly.  Five Stars and then some.
September 2018,Lovely Hotel,"My wife and I spent several days there last September.  Having never been to the Milestone (or London, for that matter), we had no idea what to expect.  The hotel was lovely, and the staff couldn't have been nicer.  Our room was on the small side, but it was well appointed, and the bathroom was large and very modern.  The bar area was a little cramped, but the overall comfort, the food and the service more than make up for it.  The location was perfect.  We could easily walk to the many parks nearby, or catch a cab and quickly be just about anywhere in the city.  As previously mentioned, the staff was wonderful, and always quick to answer questions and give advise to first time visitors.  We can't recommend The Milestone highly enough."
April 2019,Perfection,"This lovely hotel covers all aspects from the moment you arrive. Every department is outstanding, from the doormen through to the meticulous housekeeping team. Our room, 303, was like a home away from home & we would particularly like to thank  Connor & Giacomo, the Concierges, Nik at reception & Sandra, Eleanor & Magda in Chenestons restaurant who welcomed us every morning & provided warm, friendly & professional service. We come from Australia & always choose this hotel to come to after a long journey. For us it is perfect."
March 2019,Best Kept Secret in London,"My wife and I recently concluded a five night stay at the Milestone and wanted to share our experience.  As soon as we arrived we could feel the sincerity in their welcoming manner.  The doormen were attentive and personable and check in was smooth.  We were met by the guest relations manager Peggy who showed us around the hotel and who throughout our stay was always helpful and cheerful, feeling more like a good friend to us than a typical manager.  Our room was wonderfully well appointed.  The location of the hotel across from Kensington Park was ideal and the hotel’s breakfast was a great way to start our day’s adventures.  The concierge Giacamo and Jose were always very helpful.  I can’t express how wonderful everyone was and how much we look forward to our next stay at the…"
February 2019,Great hotel in excellent location,"My only disclaimer is that The Milestone isn’t a total “secret”. I see plenty of 5-Star reviews for this outstanding property on Trip Advisor, but when one speaks to friends about hotels in London, there just aren’t that many people who are familiar with it. Most Americans stay at familiar chains, you know, the big ones. The Milestone is a part of the Red Carnation group of 5-Star hotels in the UK and Europe. It is also a member of the “Leading Hotels of the World”.   This was my first time at The Milestone and was recommended to me by my brother who is in the travel industry. From the moment I entered the lobby to check-in, it was obvious that this is a truly special place. There is no glitz, just a highly refined, very British, well run hotel that immediately became my home…"
February 2019,Milestone = Marvelous,"Wonderful service, excellent onsite restaurant, and very comfortable and spacious rooms. A few minutes walk from the subway station and many restaurants and shops; steps away from a bus stop. Great view of the Kensington Gardens, which are just across the street."
June 2019,Excellent in every way,"I’ve never felt more pampered on a trip to London. Sincere, caring, genuine staff and a lovely hotel. Dining rooms beautifully appointed and quaint at the same time. And within walking distance to just about everything. We loved the Milestone."
June 2019,"Incredible Hotel, Incredible Staff!","Old world charm.  Attention to detail. Beautiful towels, bathrobes and silky linens. Excellent concierge service.  Helpful with reservations, directions and travel tips. The staff were courteous, knowledgeable and exceeded expectations.  They have a charming breakfast restaurant with deliciously prepared choices. Located within walking distance of the tube.  Superb experience."
May 2019,Perfect location for the Albert Hall,My friend and I spent a week at the Milestone.  It was perfection!  The staff was so kind and attentive and fun!  You could tell that they really wanted you to have a nice time!  Bravo to the Milestone!  My very favourite hotel in a London!  Will definitely be back!!!  Can’t wait!!!❤️
January 2019,The best hotel in London,Every time I visit — it’s like coming home. Best staff. Amazing food. Best tea in London. Cross the street and visit Kensington Palace. I’ve stayed here on business and with my family and it always inspires. 
January 2019,Just fantastic ,"We were here for our wedding anniversary, for the second time, and were really spoiled by the staff and management again. Last year, owing to works, we had to move to the sister hotel - Egerton House so we have an idea about both. In my opinion The Milestone wins hands down. You’re made welcome at both but The Milestone just seems to fit like a favourite sweater and we feel so very comfortable the whole time we’re there. I doubt we’d stay anywhere else."
January 2019,Fantastic experience made entirely from the staff,"I do not normally write reviews, but a one night stay at the Milestone deserves all the praise for an exceptional service. From the moment we arrived we felt like every member of staff REALLY cared, they were informative and enjoyed a fun banter showing interest in us and the reason for our stay. Afternoon tea served by the delightful Eleanoir, was only to pleased to accommodate the request of a marmite sandwich and green pea sandwich, only as fun but the chef duly obliged round of applause for keeping the customer happy. The hotel states that it aims to provide rooms and accessories as a “home from home” which they achieve in abundance. Cannot praise the staff enough thank you each and everyone"
July 2018,Amazing experience at the Milestone Hotel,"From the moment my family and I arrived in July (my husband and our two teenage sons) we were greeted and treated like royalty.  Our youngest commented at the end of our 5 night stay that they have ruined any future experiences at any other hotels, because no other place would ever match the care we received.  Our rooms were lovely, overlooking Kensington Park, and there was absolutely no road noise.  The food in their restaurant was amazing and the service was wonderful.  We will definitely stay there again and have already told all our friends about our experience there.  The entire staff is excellent."
January 2019,Operates like clockwork,My second great experience at The Milestone. Excellent attention to detail in the rooms - like home made biscuits as a welcome gift. Wonderful service with every interaction with staff. This hotel is run by an absolute operator.   Thoroughly deserving of their rating. 
December 2018,A picture perfect wedding,"My daughter was married and then held a small family reception and wedding meal at The Milestone in mid December. I cannot praise all of the staff at The Milestone highly enough. From reception desk, to event planning, food services, the hotel staff and hotel stay I cannot think of one negative comment. The premises are lovely and the food and beverage were superb.Thank you for making such an important day and hotel stay absolutely perfect."
January 2019,One word WOW !,"After a one night stay on business at  the milestone hotel I just had to write a review. After a long journey I was greeted at the hotel by a gentleman named Teddy with a lovely smile who instantly came and got my luggage off me and helped me into the hotel. As i walked into the hotel there was the most beautiful smell and fresh roses all over the foyer. I was given a glass of champagne whilst being checked in and given a tour of the hotel whilst my luggage was took to the room. The room was fantastic with extra special touches such as homemade biscuits and fresh flowers and the bathroom was to a high standard with penhaligons toiletries and fluffy towels. As I made my way down to the spa I was greeted by a lovely lady called ""Moy"" who made me feel most comfortable and gave the…"
December 2018,Anniversary trip,"We stayed at the Milestone for our 30th Anniversary in December and had the perfect vacation. The service is unbelievable. From an upgraded room to the special notes, treats and beautiful turndown service every evening we felt so pampered. The staff at this hotel couldn’t be any more welcoming! The concierge found fabulous theatre tickets for us and was always quick with great suggestions for outings. The intimate lounge for cocktails and the afternoon tea will not disappoint! We will most certainly stay here when returning to London. "
January 2019,Just perfect,"This is amazing hotel. High service level shown as should be. Not more not less)) Locationis very good in the city, car parking not a problem here. Helpful nice staff. Clean big room on the top floor, perfect view. Good breakfast. Highly reccommended."
June 2019,Nothing short of perfection,"We, regrettably, only managed a 1 night stay at the Milestone Hotel but it was perfect in every way. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left enjoyed a level of customer service only experienced at the finest hotels in the world.We were impressed by every single member of staff we met but particular praise must go to Pranav Ahuja (Front Office Manager). Pranav is a class act and he epitomises the art of exceptional service. If you are used to staying at higher price hotels do not underestimate the Milestone. If you are more accustomed to a more budget priced hotel the Milestone will prove to be excellent value and worth the extra.    "
May 2019,Wonderful stop,We loveeeeee this place. They go above and beyond. So hospital and accommodating in every aspect.  The bar - stables- is wonderful and the bar tenders are very knowledgeable. Ask for any drink and they will make it for you.
May 2019,Truly a gem of a boutique hotel.,"Stayed at Milestone for 4 nights at the end of May.  Everything about the stay was absolutely delightful.  They have truly perfected the element of service across all staff.  The rooms were charming with attention to small details everywhere.  Luxurious bed linens and bath towels, elegant décor and spacious bathroom was more than I had expected.  Turndown service was a different surprise each night.  Concierge staff were so knowledgeable and equally helpful.  Formal tea was the best I've had.  Dining room menu was exquisite and the food presentation and flavor could not be beat.  Best meal I had in London.  Special thanks to Leo, Food & Beverage Service manager, for his helpful expertise.  The bar area is small and charming with craft cocktails made to order.  I highly recommend…"
May 2019,LOVE IT,"We arrived at the hotel to celebrate 10th anniversary  and my husband  50th birthday. From the first moment we entered, we were greeted with a wonderful warmth, which included a brief tour of the hotel's facilities. The room we booked (Superior) was charming with a super comfortable bed, a luxurious bathroom and complimentary  treats for the double celebration. Breakfast was also excellent and included plenty of options. , I think we'll go back there at the first opportunity. Thank you very much for the perfect vacation.  "
May 2019,Fabulous lunch in a peaceful environment,"Went to lunch at the Milestone hotel this week. The food was absolutely amazing.  I had the sashimi to start which was gorgeous, followed by the pea and mint risotto.  My particular favourite was the vegan meringue and berry dessert.  The meringues were made from chickpeas.  The waiters and waitresses were fantastic and so informative about the dishes.  It was quiet, but I love it like that.  Very tranquil in the centre of London - nice to get away from it all.  It is expensive, I was there for a work lunch but would be a lovely treat for a romantic night out or special occasion."
May 2019,Elegance and warmth,"Our time spent at the Milestone could not have been more lovely.  Each and every staff member served us professionally and warmly.  Our room,  the food, the restaurant, bars, the champagne sabrage, the flowers, the gifts of fruit, scones, sweets that met us each evening all helped to make our stay there a perfect one.  We simply cannot wait to return."
May 2019,Another Great Stay,"We had another excellent stay at the Milestone.  We stayed four nights with our two daughters.  This time we did two connecting rooms.  It was great to have two rooms connected, it basically became a suite since there was an outer door that can be shut from the rest of the floor.  We had a large king size bedroom in a corner of the building.  Very spacious and the bathroom was very nice.      What really sets the Milestone apart is the service from everyone that works there.  From the concierge, the front desk, dining room, housekeeping, everyone is looking to help and gets to know you on a personal basis.  They have an ability to anticipate what you will need rather than you asking which you just do not find in many hotels.    Highly recommend the breakfast, amazing every day. …"
November 2018,Friendly Boutique Luxury.,"I do like to sample new hotels when I stay in London and have been looking at the Milestone for a while. It is wonderfully situated for the shopping on Knightsbridge, Kensington Gardens or the Road Albert Hall. It is small enough to be quite intimate yet large enough to feel like a proper hotel. The rooms are quite small but well appointed and the staff really feel like a big family and do seem to care quite genuinely about the hotel and this is reflected in an excellent level of personal service. The restaurant is small and cosy. We didn't dine but had an excellent breakfast. We were here in November '18 and liked it so much we re-booked for January '19."
February 2019,A wonderful return visit,We stayed here last year and it became our home away from home in London. The hotel is lovely but what takes it to the next level is the people and the service. Everyone knows your name and the warm greetings are sincere. Nothing is too much trouble. Do not miss the Stable Bar!!! A big shout out to my bartender buddies. See you again next year!
February 2019,"They deserve 6 stars! Amazing, warm, nice and professional hotel.","I stayed for a long weekend at the Milestone Hotel for my 50th birthday. Service was spectacular from reservations (thank you Celene) to the concierge (Giacomo who knows the city by heart and has endless patience) and the staff everywhere including Leo and the ladies at the restaurant. I decided to fly on my own and was received warmly. Little treats and a cake expected me in my room (gorgeous and tasty). The experience was fabulous from beginning to end. The hotel is clean, impeccably run - I was asked at to my experience and feedback repeatedly. Last but not least - upon check out I was given a sweet bag of biscuits and a bottle of water for the journey. This clearly proves attention to details. The only challenge I had as a foreigner was that I really did not know how to tip…"
January 2019,Milestone Hotel in London,"We stayed at Milestone hotel for four nights.  We were very impressed with the hospitality and the service we received.  The rooms were fabulously done, and the service was excellent.  The staff all knew us by name, and they went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. They serviced the room twice a day and replenished all the toiletries and left chocolate on the bed every night. Breakfast was included with our room and had a great variety of choices in a buffet style but we also had an option of ordering from a menu (without charge). They also had complimentary drinks when we arrived.  I would highly recommend this hotel whether for pleasure or business. It is very accessible to public transportation (both by bus and tube) and walking distance to many shops.  You…"
February 2019,Defines excellent service,"All those excellent reviews are well deserved. What makes this hotel truly standout is service - everyone is really coming out of their way to be helpful, and management has very well thought-through additional amenities and offers (e.g in flight picnic, help with flight arrangements etc). The property itself is a fine historical building, rooms are pretty though on a smallish side (as it always is in downtown London)."
January 2019,The best London hotel that I've stayed in....by a distance!,"I've stayed in dozens of hotels in London and hundreds around the world....mainly 5* and mainly the upper end of that.  What makes this hotel special is the staff. They are superb. The hotel is gorgeous, very comfortable, has that old-world feel but all the modern gadgets that you need and has some incredible history to boast about, but the staff go the extra mile and then a lot, lot further.  I mentioned that my rugby team was playing on the Friday evening and I got a good luck card with a ""Rugby Bible"" in my room a few hours later. Incredible.  The boys in the small but incredibly cosy bar were superb. Top marks.  The hotel's butler was simply a great source of info and an incredible host. Top marks too.  The staff in the restaurant (both I spoke to were Polish) were great…"
December 2018,Lunch,"Absolutely fantastic hotel, run by people who care about their guests and love their jobs.  A brilliant place to come and be looked after.  We had lunch in a private dining room that has been used by several of the royals!, "
February 2019,Amazing afternoon tea and wonderful staff,"My friend and I went to The Milestone yesterday afternoon and I just had to write about the exceptional service we received from our server Eleanor. She was knowledgeful, polite, informative and could not have done more. As my friend is a vegetarian and I am not, they organised a fully vegetarian stand for us both to pick from, and separated any non-vegetarian sandwiches on to a separate plate. Amazing food, all incredibly tasty and what you cannot finish is boxed up and given you to to take with you. Overall a wonderful experience, with special thanks to Eleanor"
January 2019,Absolutely the best overall high tea in London,"My 22 yo daughter and 18 yo son took our first ever trip to London and my daughter's request was to have high tea.  The Milestone was near our hotel and although it was a huge splurge for a single parent like me, it was absolutely, hands down the high tea experience of a lifetime and one of our favorite meals in London.  Even my 18yo son, who rolled his eyes when I told him we were going, walked away wanting to return, which is no small feat! From the moment you walk in the door, you are impressed with the quiet elegance of this gorgeous, historic hotel.  The library is the perfect backdrop for the most delicious tea service I've ever had, excellent pastries and scones, but the chicken salad sandwiches are simply to die for!  I would be remiss not to mention the incredibly…"
January 2019,Caring staff,"The hotel felt luxurious, comfortable, personal, interesting, the list goes on and on. Most noticably for us, the staff were attentive, personable and couldn't do enough for us. The afternoon tea was delightful and Thomas who served us was absolutely charming. Breakfast was in a light, attractive room where the fire was lit. Again, the staff were personable but not over the top. The Stirrups Bar was cosy and we completely forgot we were in the centre of London."
December 2018,Most wonderful hotel. ,"I agree with all the great reviews.  The Milestone is several cuts above the others.  The hotel is lovely, rooms very smartly appointed, etc.  But it is the staff and the little things which really set this apart.  From the moment you walk into the beautiful lobby, everyone calls you by name.  They not only tell you where to get the bus but walk out the front door to show you.  The sweets on the pillow are different every night.  The small gifts upon arrival, the welcome cocktail, the wonderful bar tenders who explained the fancy drinks they were making, the wonderful breakfast ( included and fabulous), the twice daily total maid service- everything is above first rate.  Don’t miss tea by the fire, champagne in the bar, or the lighted candle on the bathtub at night.  All…"
December 2018,"'No request too large, no detail too small'","My fiancé and I came to stay for one night and we had one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had. This quaint, cosy hotel offered tiny details at every turn and, at Christmas anyway, we felt as if we were staying in a perfect little dolls' house!  We were offered a glass of bubbles upon arrival, and the check in (and out) service was quick and efficient and the staff were extremely warm and helpful. Fortunately, our room had been upgraded and we were given a suite with a corner sofa living area. Looking at my photos, you would've thought we were there for many nights, but all of these tiny touches were placed in our room and throughout the hotel within one night! The bed was comfortable and I had a lovely bubble bath!  We were out at an event in the afternoon, but we…"
December 2018,Warm and welcoming luxury - fantastic!,"We stayed for 1 night in a junior suite (The Viscount Suite) and it was without doubt one of my best hotel experiences ever.  Some of the highlights:  + The Viscount Suite is stunning; beautifully furnished and decorated, spacious and with lovely views of Kensington Palace. The four-poster bed was fantastic. Several seating areas.  Beautiful paintings. There was also a big group of orchids. Huge TV. Snacks/nibbles provided for arrival and after turn-down.  + Excellent staff, especially the doormen and in the bar. We were always addressed by name by the doormen throughout our 1-night stay, very impressive. Everyone always met us with a smile and a very warm approach.  + I had quite a few parcels sent to the hotel in advance of our stay. This was handled perfectly.  + Top-quality…"
October 2018,Family hotel,"This is the best hotel i stayed in my life, all the staff in the hotel are very friendly and they welcome you when you arrive at the hotel. you feel like home, i always feel that i am at home with the family. Its both a family and a business trip hotel. all the staff treat you as a person not as a number in the hotel. and they always try to help you if you have any issues. i recommend if you go to London to stay at the milestone hotel. the hotel is like a 7 star hotel, and is always the best."
December 2018,Fabulous boutique hotel ,"My husband and I just checked out of The Milestone Hotel and I wanted to evaluate it on TripAdvisor as it deserves a fabulous review.  If you’re the type of person who appreciates the personalized attention and old fashioned, traditional and more formal atmosphere that a boutique hotel has to offer, search no further. This hotel will be perfect for you. And, it’s location in Kensington is wonderful and convenient.  Our hotel room was extremely well appointed and immaculate. The bathroom was large although our queen sized bed and bedroom were on the small side. But, it was sufficient for our needs and the extreme attention to details and services far outweighed the size of our room.  I honestly cannot say enough wonderful things about this hotel and it’s staff -especially Tim,…"
November 2018,"Health club with Fiona Keane- BEST TREATMENT EVER- jet lag treatment, TRY IT!","This November I had the opportunity to stay at the Milestone alongside my husband over Thanksgiving. The Milestone was a magnificent choice to stay during the holidays, it was cozy, we were well taken care of, and the William and Kate residence is BEAUTIFUL.  The stag was extreme moly helpful and accommodating, even booking us last minute reservations when our fell through on Thanksgiving.  My favorite experience with the hotel was actually the SPA! This was only a 4 1/2 day trip for myself and I was handling the jet lag alright, but my skin was dry and of course my body a little exhausted. I noticed there was a full jet lag treatment which all hotels seem to offer, but I thought why not, it’s a holiday...  This. Was. INCREDIBLE. I actually should have reviewed sooner, but I’ll…"
November 2018,Cannot speak highly enough,"My girlfriend and I initially visited the hotel in early November. Despite having to wait only minutes for our room to be available, we were offered a free drink of our choosing whilst we waited. Nice touch!  After we'd checked in and started to enjoy our stay, I sadly received an urgent phone call regarding the health of a family member. It was so urgent we had to leave immediately having only been at the hotel for perhaps an hour or so. The receptionist (Peggy) and the rest of the staff were extremely understanding and efficient with how they helped us depart. So much so, they didn't charge us for the stay and allowed us to use the night at a later date at no extra charge. Wonderful service.  We rearranged the night for a month or so later, and as to their word allowed us a…"
December 2018,Great hotel fab location ,"What a delight to stay here. The staff, decor, room, all perfect. We stayed in the sister hotel 41 recently as it was voted no 1 hotel to stay on trip advisor and we found this far better. Great location for exploring, lovely afternoon tea too. We would def stay here again "
November 2018,"Our special ""home"" in London",We love this hotel.  What a very special place.  We are made to feel so welcome by all the staff and this special care continues throughout our stay.  The bedrooms and suites are all unique and everything about them is first class - from the bedding to the amenities to the room service and housekeeping.  We never want to leave.  The breakfasts are amazing - anything you could possibly wish for and we also enjoy dining in the restaurant for lunch or dinner. We are looking forward to returning next Summer.
December 2018,Another PERFECT visit. Attention to detail still impressive,"We were at the Milestone back in May of this year and we just could not wait to return. This time we brought along some friends to see this charming hotel with world class service. As always, this hotel never disappoints. Service and charm is consistent and world class. There are a lot of lovely 5 star, triple diamond hotels around but then, there is this hotel, the Milestone. ""World class"" is still not good enough to describe the hotel and the people who work there. The attention to detail is so scary, I love it! Just amazes me how the staff do what they do on a day to day basis. Special shout out to Giacomo and Angelo who were the bartenders when I was there in May and is still there today. They are just AMAZING and I love just talking to them and getting to know them. We so…"
November 2018,Lazy afternoon,Intimate hotel that feels cozier than the Baglioni nearby. Nice afternoon tea service. Convenient location just near Kensington Garden. Multiple little cute spaces to have cocktails or tea. Worth the visit. 
November 2018,Prince Harry and Princess Megans escape digs from LA FROG (Prince in Training),"Prince Harry, and Megans escape digs: Prince Harry and Princess Megan, have a huge dilemma WHERE TO GO WHEN MUMS (Her Majesty the Queen of England) is away, well not spoiled for choice, The LA Girl who would be A Princess, and actually live happily ever after, chose our little Milestone Hotel to be ever so delighted with the same things this former LA boy ok FROG in Prince training delighted in.   1.  Sumptuous interiors, replete with so much charm it made me kind of gasp when I went in the front door. 2. Warm, friendly and filled with youth staff that still made me feel an air of surprising superiority and dripping in wealth.  YES I WAS REALLY WORKING MY BLUE BLAZER, and GOLD BUTTONS. 3. I remember someone once said first impressions are just important for those who experience…"
October 2018,One of the best afternoon teas I had.......,"One of the best afternoon teas I have had .....  We booked afternoon tea for my aunts 80th Birthday.  The tea was superb, the service was great and the staff helpful and friendly especially Jack and Sandra.  I would recommend a visit."
November 2018,Milestone Birthday Celebration,"I went with my daughters to celebrate two milestone birthdays and we couldn't have picked a more perfect spot.  The location, staff, rooms, amenities, turn-down treats, restaurant, bar, and, well, everything including the birthday cake that came from the hotel with balloons all made for a very memorable trip.  Our driver, Colin, all those at concierge and reception desk, and everyone else anticipated our needs and ensured that we were well taken care of.  We would highly recommend the hotel for anyone who wants to feel pampered."
December 2018,Amazing hotel,"One of the best I have ever visited. Very clean rooms, amazing food quality and most important the most welcoming staff. Amazing location facing the Hyde Park.  It simply makes you feel home away from home. "
October 2018,Perfect in every way,"I stayed at The Milestone with my parents and brother. All of the employees greeted us by name and made us feel so welcome and comfortable. Each of the rooms had unique decor, but always lovely. The breakfast was truly a stand out. It is served in a beautiful fireplace room and nearly everything you could imagine was available on the menu. I really enjoyed everything about our stay at this quintessential British hotel!"
December 2018,Spectacular!,"Outstanding customer service, beautiful surroundings and delicious food, what more could you wish for from a hotel?   We hosted an evening wedding and reception in the Milestone Hotel and everything was truly magical, we really couldn’t wish for anything more.    Our every need was catered for and nothing was too much trouble. All members of staff were professional, helpful and friendly.   Celene, our contact from initial enquiry and throughout the preparations was a dream to work with and organised everything to perfection.   Another key member of the team was Leo Forte, a charming man who will go far in the hospitality industry, he ensured everything ran smoothly on the night and was on hand the following morning to assist with the departure of our guests from the hotel.  …"
December 2018,Exceptional hotel,"What do you want from a hotel? Think really hard, close your eyes, make a wish, tap your heels together three times and, hey presto, The Milestone appears in front of you.   There’s nothing I can add to other positive reviews. This is simply the best hotel I’ve ever stayed in. Good, old-fashioned customer service at its finest. Treat yourself. You won’t be disappointed. Exceptional."
November 2018,Great stay at a marvellous hotel!,"My wife and myself went to London one week ago to first (my wife’s choice) look at a musical (Wicked - which was very good in fact) and then Spurs vs Inter at Wembley on Wednesday (great game - fantastic team ....) - my choice...   And we stayed at the Milestone hotel, it was absolutely first class - all the way. Very nice rooms, great food, lovely and pleasant staff! Surpassed by no one! We will love to come back - and even the door man was very nice even though his favourite team (Liverpool - poor guy) lost that evening - while my (extremely splendid) team Spurs won .... "
November 2018,Wonderful Stay at The Milestone Hotel,"The Milestone Hotel is a ""must stay"" for a traveler to London. It is a quaintly British hotel that is beautifully decorated to reflect its character. That in itself is reason to book this hotel; yet, the service and hospitality of the entire staff are what sets this hotel head and shoulders above any others we have experienced. From their greeting at our arrival, we were pampered with congenial room service (no extra charge) and nightly turn-downs with sweets tucked on our pillows, welcomed guidance from the concierge and yes, the doorman. Everyone was so friendly and so genuinely interested in making our trip to London a memorable one. The Milestone anticipates its guests' every need.

November 2018,Enjoyable Stay,"Very accommodating staff, friendly and courteous. Was staying here for 2 nights and it was a wonderful experience. Though it was a tiring day for me bu this place makes me feel relaxed and comfortable."
November 2018,"Classy, classic and warm with outstanding service","Upon arrival, we (three families) were greeted with a smile and courteous, efficient and friendly front of house staff. The room was very nice, and we had an adjoining room for our kids which was also lovely. Everything about the hotel, from rooms to furnishings and art around the hotel, oozes class. Nothing was too much trouble for the team there and this seems to be at the core of the Red Carnation group's values. Breakfast was lovely and it was intriguing to see how popular the English afternoon tea was as early as 1pm - it did look impressive and authentic.  The Royal Albert Hall is within walking distance as are shops and Kensington Park is the other side of the road - I had a lovely walk through. If you like modern, tech-friendly (the WiFi was good) automated hotels, this…"
November 2018,Brilliant and super experienced Fiona at the Health Club and Great authentic experience,"I was staying in The Milestone for a week, greatly located! Prove a strong feeling of home and luxury care about guests.  Super experienced Fiona at the Health Club does excellent massage, bringing you in life back after busy week, highly recommended! "
November 2018,Always Brilliant,"Not missing a beat after a year's absence, I was greeted by name at the door and warmly welcomed back by the staff in the lobby.  Love the location across from the park and the wonderfully designed and comfortable suites, but it really is about the people.  Returning to my room from a run while it was being made up, the housekeeping staff immediately stopped what they were doing to provide me with a bottle of water.  When the concierge overheard me tell the door man that I left my phone at Selfridges, he was on the phone immediately trying to track it down.  My ritual of a nightly Negroni with the bar crew is like hanging with friends.  Just the best."
October 2018,Welcome return to the finest place in town,"Stayed for a weekend last month and very pleased to see that everything was just as good as the previous visit. Staff are extremely courteous and welcoming and attention to detail is spot on. Enjoyed the champagne afternoon tea and there really is far too much to eat in one sitting - no problem, if you like, the staff will box any remainders for you and leave in your room. Everything was very pleasant and looking forward to returning when we next have to be in London."
October 2018,GOLDEN WEDDING CELEBRATION WEEKEND,"Two weeks ago we spent three nights at the Milestone Hotel celebrating our Golden Wedding Anniversary along with our close family.  We found that the hotel definitely lived up to its five star luxury rating, but being a relatively small boutique hotel we had much more personal service than one would have experienced at a larger more impersonal chain establishment.  The staff looked after us all from the moment we arrived to when we checked out.  The rooms were opulent and classically furnished, and the breakfasts were some of the best we have ever enjoyed in a hotel.   Our Celebration Dinner was lovely with our every need catered for including the likes and dislikes of our rather awkward five year old granddaughter.  Nothing was too much trouble for every member of staff.   Our…"
September 2018,Treated like Royalty,"Our stay at The Milestone Hotel and Residences was fabulous!  Upon arriving, we were greeted at the door, had a lovely check-in experience, and then received a personal tour of the hotel on the way to our room.  The room was breathtaking! The staff really went above and beyond to make us feel like royalty--even throwing in free drinks at the bar!  The bed was comfortable, the breakfast was delicious, and the personal touches were much appreciated.    The location is excellent!  We were within walking distance to shops, restaurants, Hyde Park, and Kensington Palace.  I can't say enough wonderful things about this hotel!!"
November 2018,50th Birthday Celebration,"Had an amazing stay. Hotel was of the highest calibre. Customer service and attention to detail were exemplary. Staff were very friendly, helpful and attentive. Would definitely recommend it and will be definitely returning."
October 2018,A special Weekend,We stayed at the Milestone Hotel for a long weekend to attend a concert at The Royal Albert Hell which is within a short walking distance as is Kensington Palace. From the moment my 2 friends and myself walked in we were made very welcome by the friendly staff. Our room was something special and there was nothing left that couldn’t be done to make our stay very comfortable and enjoyable. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were very clean. We experienced Afternoon Tea on one of the days and so happy we did. My friends and myself were treated like Princesses throughout and will definitely be back.
July 2018,A lovely and exclusive taste of old school London 5 star Hotel,"Staying at the Milestone is really like being at home, only more expensive. Rooms are of very good class, They differ in size and views but on both our stays we have been very happy. they are roomy with big bathrooms and a great feel to them. The bar and the restaurant are pleasant in all ways if not with a partyfeel. The staff are supernice and friendly in the bar especially. we watched World cup football in the bar with other guests. Very nice. Breakfast i top class but my only negative comment is that breakfast staff appear a bit unconcentrated, forgetting things and being a bit off a couple of them. Best is the Conciergeteam and frontdesk and bellboys/men. All with a fantastic friendly and happy approach to their job, to service and to their guests.  The location is good if…"
September 2018,One of the best!,"Couldn’t say anything negative. Luxury service, beautiful rooms, great hotel indeed! I love the antique decor, it looks very luxurious.  We will definitely come back the next time we visit Kensington again."
September 2018,Incredible Hotel and Staff,"I had the pleasure of spending four days in this lovely hotel. We had Afternoon Tea in the Park Lounge that was marvelous, and the service was top notch. We greatly enjoyed the appeal of the Stable Bar in the hotel and spent time there relaxing at the end of the day. The Milestones location if fantastic and has great restaurants like the Cheneston with in their hotel, and more in walking distance."
October 2018,The Milestone is a Treasure,"We have stayed in many lovely hotels all over the world, for our business and for our personal travels as well.  The Milestone is without a doubt our favorite hotel we have ever stayed in! Staying for about a week gave us a mere taste of the graciousness of their staff, their dining experiences, and lovely rooms.  So much so, we can’t wait to return to London for a second visit to stay @ The Milestone again.  We were absolutely taken with London and the countryside as well. Our 25th anniversary celebration in UK/London could not have been more delightful. The Milestone is a Treasure to behold!"
October 2018,Afternoon tea ,"We went to this hotel for afternoon tea and I have to say it was absolutely marvellous! The service was impeccable and we were predominantly looked after by David. He made us feel very welcome and we wanted for nothing, another stomach would have been helpful.  Great tea selection with champagne on offer if we had wished to indulge but to be honest I prefer beer. I selected the Assam tea, the others Darjeeling and Afternoon Tea. All delicious.  Great sandwich and cake selection plus scones which were freshly baked for us while we ate the cakes and sandwiches.  Scones arrived nice and warm.  Would definitely recommend this hotel for afternoon tea. "
October 2018,Gorgeous Hotel,This fabulous hotel had impeccable service. Beautiful rooms. Lovely service. Small but functional gym. Scones and treats brought nightly to the room. Also loved the library and all of the different sitting rooms. 
September 2018,The Cheniston Room at the Milestone Hotel,"I regard this as one of the best restaurants, if not the best restaurant, in London. It has a bar very well stocked with premium spirits and an excellent barman. The restaurant is quiet and the food and service are of a very high standard. It is the only London restaurant I have found at which one can get a madeira after dinner."
October 2018,Dad and Daughter High Tea ,"This was a lovely place for high tea. It is pricey. But i had a great time and experience with my daughter. We had the traditional tea service, selected two different teas, were treated to traditional sandwiches, pastries and the best scones baked to order I have ever had. The tea area is small but oh so cozy. We were never rushed and stayed and bonded for almost three hours. Its right across from Kensington gardens where we wandered to after for a nice walk. This was very good."
August 2018,Superstar Service,"I been stayed at milestone hotel in Kensington. It was a great experience. Service was excellent. Housekeeping ""Maria Caldeira"" did a great service. A big thanks to Maria. My wife was so happy.  Thanks milestone team for a wonderful service.   "
September 2018,"Great Small Hotel, Great Location","We recently spent 9 nights at the Milestone Hotel in Kensington, London. We could not have been more pleased; with one exception I'll discuss shortly. The hotel is right across the street from Kensington Palace so from our room we had a view of parkland, Although we were on the 4th floor the windows were so well insulated that traffic on Kensington High St. was inaudible. We were in the Viscount suite which was large and charmingly decorated with victorian period  furnishings including an exceptionally comfortable, massive four poster bed. The one problem was the bathroom. Beautifully decorated with stylish colors-it was in our opinion too small. In addition, and we had been warned, there was no separate shower, plus the access to the tub/shower was not easy for a mobility…"
September 2018,All hotels should treat you this way,"From the time we entered the hotel we felt at home.  Each staff member was willing to do whatever was necessary to make sure our stay exceeded expectations.  The common areas were always full of fragrant floral displays, our room was clean, comfortable and up to date.  Breakfast was included in our stay.  Each morning the staff was wonderful and the food plentiful and delicious.  Well located for west enders right across the street from Hyde Park and close to the tube if you choose public transportation versus a cab.  If this works for you location and cost wise this is a place to try."
October 2018,Get pampered,"Great location: the parks (Kensington & Hyde Park), the restaurants of all kinds, in or out, the shopping even at lower prices( UniQLO,TKMAXX) the nearby tube. Greeted by name when you arrive, lots of smiles and they really care about you. Enjoy a real English breakfast in a former chapel. Order your own paper. Seat comfortably and order a night cup."
October 2018,Great hotel,"I spent 1 night at The Milestone Hotel in London in October. As I arrived, I was greeted by a very nice doorman, then checked in immediately into an upgraded room. It was a studio room, called Margaret Rose, with a charming decor and a splendid view of the park. When I wanted to go for a walk, the gentleman from the concierge helped me to find my way and recommended some good restaurants in the neighborhood. I also had a splendid breakfast (included in the room rate) and a wonderful traditional afternoon tea. I know there are many hotels in London, but this hotel and its staff were great to me in every way and I will return."
October 2018,Home from Home,This hotel is such a haven in the frantic city. The décor is so homely and the staff are amazing seamlessly making sure every detail is attended to and they are all do friendly. Afternoon tea is a must and eating in Cheneston's restaurant is so relaxing and the food wonderful. Then you must have a cocktail in the Stables bar such a cosy space.
April 2018,Service 2nd to none,The attention to detail and personal service is what will bring us back. The front desk and bellmen remembered our names and what our plans were for the entire 5 days we stayed. The dinner was amazing at the restaurant and the room was very much 5 star.
October 2018,"Exceptional, refined luxury",The best asset of a company is arguably your staff.  Well get prepared for an exceptional and warm welcome from the Milestone Hotel.  Not only are they warm and welcoming but they simply cannot do enough for you to ensure a phenomenally enjoyable stay.  Check in was effortless and we were shown around so we could achieve maximum value from the stay.  The Hotel is spotless and the room certainly didn’t disappoint.  The bed was very comfortable and almost everything you need is in the room including a spacious bathroom.  I didn’t have an iron which would have been useful but maybe if I had asked it could have been done quickly.  Breakfast was delicious with the usual array of wholesome breakfast foods in a plentiful buffet.  Hot food is ordered and was very good including the…
July 2018,Not just a hotel but a home,"We had an extended stay experience at the Milestone Hotel during the month of July in one of the newly renovated residences with our family of 5.  This was our second trip to the Milestone hotel.  Our first was in 2015 and after a short four days we knew we couldn't wait to return.   In finding out we had a long stay in London, we were pleased to learn about the residences.  We had the benefits of lots of space, a kitchen (actually 2) and washer dryers (2 of those too!) while still getting to experience the wonderful service and amenities that the hotel had to offer.   Our stay could not have been better.   The room was perfect, the location was perfect (across from the park for morning excercise and close to the tube), and the service was above and beyond.   The staff truly…"
September 2018,Stately Hotel,We spent two nights at the Milestone Hotel and had two adjoining rooms.   From the moment we arrived we felt very welcomed.   We were shown our rooms and the hotel common areas along with breakfast room.    We were offered a complimentary drink in the conservatory with snacks.   Our rooms were beautifully designed with very clean bathrooms stocked with an assortment toiletries.  We took advantage of tea service in the afternoon which was delightful.  So many choices!!!   Travelers should take note that a 12% tip is automatically included on your bill in the bar and tea room.  This is totally acceptable but if you are normally tipping 20% on the table you might find it helpful to know ahead.  All very trustworthy staff which were kind and helpful.  Lastly we need to mention the…
September 2018,"It's the best, but always goes above and beyond","I've raved about The Milestone Hotel on this site before, and didn't figure I had to gild the lily with a second rave, but here I am.  We get to London two or three times a year, and our trip month last month was to meet up with friends to help celebrate the 25th anniversary of Ffiona's Restaurant just over on Kensington Church St. (see big ol' rave review of Ffiona's) and our dear friend Ffiona Reid-Owen.  Of course we booked The Milestone, arriving unusually early in the a.m. -- who knew airlines and London transport could be so efficient? -- and, as you might expect, were greeted with the standard, ""We're so sorry no rooms are ready yet.""  I can get pretty petulant, but my wife persuaded me to be an adult and have coffee in the hotel library, not unload on the desk staff at…"
October 2018,Fab Afternoon tea!,"We didn’t stay at the Milestone Hotel, but stopped in and saw their lovely tea room, so made a reservation.  We loved it!  The room is intimate and charming, the staff are so friendly and accommodating, the food was delicious!  We had the Royal Tea with champagne which made it even more festive.  There’s an excellent selection of teas, too.  It was a very relaxed setting.  Will definitely go back next time we are in London!"
August 2018,World-class Hotel,"We recently had the privilege of spending three nights at the Milestone.  Everything was truly outstanding.  The rooms were more than comfortable and the staff could not be better.  Absolutely everyone we had contact with, from the doorman, front desk and concierge, to the waiters and bar staff, were among the most helpful and genuinely friendly we have encountered at any hotel.  The attention to details such as providing a different small treat in our room every day, lighting a candle in the bath during the evening turn-down service, and even wrapping the cord to our cell phone charger with a small Velcro tie they provided, put them in a category far above the ordinary.  We're looking forward to returning to the Milestone the next time we are in London."
August 2018,Second time here and can't wait to come back.,"I love the Red Carnation Hotels - they just get it right. I have stayed at 3 in London but the Milestone is my favorite. Every detail is thought out and every staff member helpful. The rooms are on the small side but comfortable. Small rooms are common in most hotels in European cities so nothing new here. Bathrooms are large and great amenities. I love that the room is completely refreshed, not just a turndown bed, every evening when we were out to dinner. Breakfast is lovely with great service and dinner superb.   Location is great - just across from Kensington Gardens where you can stroll along or ride bikes. Shopping is around the corner on the High Street. I taxi's or Uber'd everywhere so can't comment on location of public transport.  Can't wait for an excuse to come back."
August 2018,Top Hotel - great location,"We stayed 2 nights at this hotel (with our dog) and the experience was excellent ..the rooms , bar, dining / breakfast area are good but what really stood out is the friendliness /attentiveness of the staff everything with a genuine smile and the intension to make you feel at home"
July 2018,Great hotel,"My family and I recently returned from a 2 night stay at this lovely hotel.  Upon arrival, we were warmly welcomed by the staff and immediately felt happy that we had chosen to stay at this boutique property. Location was perfect-close to the Hop On.Hop Off bus stop and well within walking distance to wonderful restaurants and shops.  The rooms were beautifully decorated and spacious with all the amenities you would expect at a 5 star hotel.  Charming bar with a friendly bartender.  Excellent breakfast.  Helpful concierge.  My six year old granddaughter was made to feel special throughout our stay.  Highly recommend this wonderful hotel in the Kensington section of London."
July 2018,Classic and stylish hospitality,"when a was a teenager i was sometimes allowed to accompany my father on his business trips to London. I found the Hyde Park hotel ( now the Oriental Mandarin )where we always stayed wonderful, with its large baths and its bar where you were immediately recognised. I have kept a fondness for Edwardian atmosphere reflecting the idyllic world of P.G. Wodehouse. I wanted to give my youngest son a comparable reminiscence on our visit to London and fortunately we found this we found this warm, courteous welkome at the Milestone hotel. Every small detail is thought of. I liked the small stacks of books everywhere ( some proved te be from libraries in the USA),which give a homely feeling. Every detail is thought of. The breakfast could not be better. We partied very contended father and…"
August 2018,The Most Amazing Hotel,I have grown up going to London and in many different hotels. I was lucky enough to be referred to this hotel for my holiday. I couldn’t express more how amazing the entire experience has been. It is the most excellent service that exceeds expectations every time. They have been wonderful with my boys and it just has been a delight to stay here. Location is perfect and the hotel is quintessential British elegance through and through. Make this a destination. If you can’t stay here- splurge for the High Tea or a gin and tonic in the charming bar.
August 2018,Six stars,"This establishment is more deserving of a six star rating! The attention to detail in every facet is absolutely flawless. I return time and time again to The Milestone Hotel. How I could never tire of its exquisitely charming interiors and the impeccable service provided by its staff. Having being resident in London for 8 years, The Milestone Hotel is my preferred venue of choice for celebrating special occasions. The Red Carnation Hotel Group has perfection defined in The Milestone. A special thank you to employee Leo and his colleagues for making a recent visit particularly amazing!"
August 2018,Can’t be better,"I’m always a fan of West London, although this is the first time I stay in Milestone hotel.    The Kensington district is pretty and convenient, of course very safe as well. From the time we check in, everyone is very professional and great, they remember our names and make us feel home every day.   The hotel is soooo beautiful, check the salon! You can’t miss a tea time here.   Our room is classic and spacious, as well as luxury bathroom. Night shutdown service is also well set, love candies given every evening.   Breakfast is served with buffet & à la carte, I enjoy my traditional benedict on English muffins.   I will be back with no doubts. "
July 2018,A wounderful hotel !,"A really nice hotel with great service and staff. Good location close to the park, easy to get around by tube, bus or taxi. British charm and identity without the staff being intrusive. Luxury feeling, nice breakfast, comfortable rooms and beds.  We will certainly be back!"
August 2018,Milestone Hotel Kensington London,"If you ever want to feel special this is the place to stay!  We had a standard room but it was on the 5th floor overlooking Kensington Palace Gardens.  Super comfortable bed, scones delivered to your room for afternoon tea, breakfast so many choices.  I felt like a princess."
July 2018,Feels like Home,"The Milestone is a fabulous hotel located near Kensington Palace. We loved the location near the park for morning runs/walks and it was in close proximity to many great restaurants. It is a small hotel with GREAT amenities. Top notch service from the doormen to the concierge to the friendly bartender! The rooms were well equipped and cozy. There is a gym and steam on site. It felt like a reprieve from the hustle and bustle of London. The doorman greeted us each time with ""Welcome Home!"" Highly recommend over the bigger name hotels."
September 2018,MadameKK,We had an excellent  champagne afternoon tea. We love the scones.Very friendly staff. Great with the children. The girls had their princess and decorated their own cup cakes. Very nice ambience. We will be back!
September 2018,New favourite!,Stayed in September. Was so impressed by the hotel and in particular the service. Each and every member of staff were very caring and passionate about the hotel and proud of the property. The place is very traditional and charming and the team really went the extra mile to ensure the stay was perfect!
September 2018,Beautiful hotel with the beautiful staff and the best dog-friendly hotel,"I took my little dog to treat ourselves for a couple of days. All the staff were so friendly and nice to my dog, who had everything she wanted in the room including yummy dog room service! She also enjoyed running in Hyde Park so the location was perfect too! The second night was my birthday and I got a lot of beautiful cakes etc. from the hotel. We enjoyed every minute of our stay there and would definitely come back!"
March 2018,Overlooks Meghan and Harry's Castle,"Every room and suite in this elegant boutique hotel is different--and charming-- plus the view from some is of Hyde Park and Kensington Palace, where Prince William and Prince Harry and their families reside. Love the antique furniture, myriad of paintings and especially the cozy bar with its life-sized jockey attired in silks, an homage to when this building served as a stables for the palace."
September 2018,Top notch service,"Stayed here sadly for only one night (wish I could have stayed longer). From my arrival at the hotel to my departure, everyone knew my name and was super friendly and truly wanted to make conversation with me.  I did not receive a welcome drink, but received a free room upgrade a suite and received delicious cookies and tea upon arrival into my room. The Penhaligon's amenities are excellent! The room wifi was great, and the gym was excellent. The hotel is located right across the street from Kensington Gardens. There is a tube stop just a block away. Lots of stores nearby. I will definitely try to stay again if I come to London!"
September 2018,Home away from home,"Stayed for 5 nights. Previously stayed at their sister hotel Egerton which we loved so wanted to try Milestone. Very English decor, more so than Egerton. Rooms on the small side but very cozy. You get to like the hotel more every day. Nice treats every night at bed downturn. The concierge Giucomo was very friendly and helpful. Patient with all the questions. The doorman( sorry forgot his name) was very friendly. First day complained about the noise of the ac. The manager apologized, fixes it and offer us dinner in their restaurant. This is customer service!!  Would definitely stay again."
September 2018,"Location, quality, and customer service!","The Kensington area is a great location if you prefer to be close to Hyde Park, which is a gem in the middle of bustling London. Milestone provided warm and welcoming, but not intrusive service. Everyone is friendly and happy to help, and seem happy to be there. The room (Kensington Garden Suite) was immaculate with beautiful traditional British decor, quiet and comfortable. The genuine character of the building is breathtaking and the upkeep is admirable. Would definitely stay here again. "
August 2018,Cosy and welcoming hotel,"Staff at reception and bar very welcoming. We arrived late and the person at reception keep us around offered a nice welcome drink and explained everything (he tried to welcome us as much as possibile). The room is really nice, we had a deluxe. With everything needed. We had dinner with them. Was late dinner so only few plates were available. The were quick and food was good. It's a cosy hotel with a little cosy tea room, nice restaurant for breakfast. Looks like traditional english. We liked the style. Our waiter was Angelo, very nice guy. Even id was late he gave us a very good service. Breakfast buffet is small but you can order a la carte. The young blond lady at breakfast I suggest you to correct her way to do. She is not smiling and she is not very welcoming. We asked for…"
June 2018,My Absolute Favourite Hotel!,"I was lucky enough to stay at this charming hotel for a working week. The night porter helped me with my luggage on my arrival. He brought it straight to my room with no delay. I enjoyed an excellent Full English breakfast with one of my colleagues and got on with a hectic schedule at work. We took coffee breaks and ate all our meals at the hotel. as and when time permitted. One evening I had a chat with Malcolm, the resident pianist, who plays differing classics for the diners entertainment. He asked if I had a request and played them superbly. A really nice touch as I tucked into my fish dinner! Many people came to the hotel for meetings, afternoon tea and Champagne lunches. There’s always something going on and interesting people to chat to.  In short the staff are all…"
August 2018,Truly 5 Star!,"My girlfriend and i have stayed at other hotels within the group and have always been so very impressed by the quality and personalised nature of the hotels and the incredible level of service that you receive. The Milestone was no exception and once again the service was incredible from opening the car door, to checkin, to tour of the hotel facilities and room. The smallest details are what make this hotel special, a personalised welcome message from the manager, a plate of fresh fruit, everyone remembers your name and so it goes on. The room was fantastic, everything you need and more besides. Restaurant was excellent, food great, service was attentive as you would expect with out being over the top. We have been fortunate to stay at other 5 star hotels in London, but we keep…"
February 2018,A great hotel,"I have stayed there twice, and it is a very good hotel. It is very well run with good service and an attentive staff.  It is also in an area with good walking to shops, restaurants, hair sales and even palaces :)"
July 2018,Absolutely outstanding,"I stayed here with my family after the hotel came highly recommended by my parents. I was extremely impressed with the service from the moment we walked in. We were greeted every time we walked in and out of the lobby. The building and the apartment were GORGEOUS, the amenities endless - not to mention the basket of treats and wine left by the hotel! The hotel is conveniently right across from Kensington Palace and Hyde Park, and down the street from a tube station and Royal Albert Hall. I left some items behind after returning to the states, and within an hour of calling the concierge, he had made arrangements to ship them back. I was blown away by the kindness and friendliness of all the staff; they always went above and beyond to make us feel safe and welcome. The staff even…"
July 2018,Simply the best,"We stayed here as a couple last fall and brought back our kids this summer so they could  also experience London and the tremendous Milestone. 6 of us, all adults stayed in the 3 bedroom residence, each with its own bathroom. BEAUTIFULLY decorated, comfortable and as always we were once again blown away by the incomparable service and staff. So lovely to have a small kitchen to use, and the lounge area was perfect to gather and enjoy each other's company after a long day of exploring. The location is absolutely perfect -  literally across the street from Hyde Park and Kensington Palace, 5 minute walk to the Tube station, and a comfortable walk to Royal Albert Hall and the V&A museums.Our breakfast each morning in the dining room was phenomenal. Even when there was one tiny…"
June 2018,There are Five Star Hotels than there is The Milestone Hotel,"Everyone that works in the hospitality industry should stay at The Milestone Hotel because that is how it is done.  From check in to check out this hotel is nothing short of outstanding.  The staff is pleasant and always willing to help assist you in any way to make your stay five stars. From the doormen to the front desk to the maid service everyone is professional and friendly and made me feel right at home.  Located close to the subway, Hyde Park and the legendary Royal Albert Hall this hotel is close to everything you need during your London visit.  I also ate at Cheneston's Restaurant and my meal was one that I will not soon forget.  I enjoyed my time in London and staying at The Milestone Hotel made it even more memorable."
July 2018,World Class,"A treat for my mum - a wonderful hotel in London with a night at the Opera  From the boys on the door, to reception to the restaurant and housekeeping.  Everyone showed world class customer service.  I run my own business delivering training and development to businesses on how to be strategically the best they can be.  The hotel is like watching a masterclass on one of my courses.  Many congratulations and thank you so much.  We will be back soon"
June 2018,WOW!,"I was recommended this hotel by a friend who works in Palm Beach. Didn't know I was in for a treat! My family and I were treated like royalty, and the staff made our stay very memorable. Service and food were fabulous. Neighborhood is quiet (better than Mayfair) but central enough to find a cab in seconds or walk to stores. Amenities in the room were first class. This hotel is across the street from the Kensington Gardens and at walking distance from the Kensington Palace. Mayfair is 10 minutes by car. If you are looking for quality Hospitality at a reasonable price, The Milestone Hotel & Residences is it."
May 2018,Absolutely outstanding hotel,"The Milestone is in an ideal location across from Hyde Park with easy access to all transportation options.  The staff were the friendliest, most professional we have ever experienced.  What an idyllic stay!  Especially outstanding was the concierge and his staff -- both before we arrived and throughout our visit.  Each time we arrived back after a day, all the staff greeted us with, ""Welcome home,"" which they truly meant.  Every one of the common rooms is a gem.  Full breakfast each day and dinner were wonderful treats."
May 2018,A wonderful nostalgia visit,"My previous stay at the Milestone was as a 12 year old in 1959. We used to live around the corner in Prince of Wales Terrace. My family stayed at the hotel for 3 weeks. The dining room then was in the basement and they had the best spaghetti dishes in town. It was a marvellous hotel then. My wife and I stopped by on our recent visit to London. We were given the most charming welcome by the doorman and concierge, They encouraged us to explore the hotel and see all the wonderful improvements. The dining room (no longer in the basement!) and the meals are superb. The Milestone is a classic, elegant and very friendly hotel. It is in a classy and convenient location. We look forward to our next stay."
August 2017,Beautiful hotel,"Lovely people at reception, house keeping and restaurant, they take care of every detail to make sure you are fine. The restaurant at hotel was very good. Breakfast can be better but overall I had a good experience staying at Milestone hotel. Welcome drink was a plus."
June 2018,Best. Hotel. Ever.,"The Milestone Hotel is hands down my favorite hotel of all time. I've stayed in numerous upscale hotels, and I've never received the level of customer service that I received while staying here. My husband and I stayed here for a portion of our honeymoon, and it was superb.  The establishment itself is beautiful and highly maintained, and the location is convenient. Breakfast can be served to your room every morning at no additional charge, and their food is absolutely wonderful. We also had afternoon tea one of the days, and we had a blast! Such a perfect date. They brought us so much food we couldn't finish it all, and their tea is exquisite. Every staff member we came into contact with was kind and smiling. We let the concierge choose our dinner location every night, and they…"
June 2018,Like coming home! ,"Such a lovely stay! Incredibly attentive staff, who greet you by name each morning and night. Like staying with family across the pond! We had a 2 adjoining rooms, perfect for families. Rooms have everything you can need, including adaptors. "
May 2018,Honeys trip,"This was my second time at the hotel & they did not disappoint. We were so impressed when we where their last you we had to come back. Every room is unique, the staff is excellent & the concierges are exceptional. We asked the concierge for more authentic cuisine for dinner & they sent us to small venues & large just “perfect”. Location is great just across the street from Kensington Palace. "
June 2018,Amazing afternoon tea,Took my relatives from the USA for a very special afternoon tea with my two children aged 9 and 6. From the moment we arrived the staff could not have been nicer or more helpful. It was very posh but they may us feel comfortable and relaxed and put a special effort into engaging the children !!! The afternoon tea was so special and absolutely delicious !!!  Then they offered to decorate cupcakes with the children which was amazing and so nice - the kids had a ball. We were not rushed in any way and we were offered bottled water on leaving as it was a very hot day !!!  Their service was 15/10!!! Never have I felt so welcome and relaxed anywhere with my kids especially as it is a beautiful hotel!!! They treat their customers with elegance and such thoughtfulness!!!! I'm going back…
May 2018,PERFECT! Attention to details-AMAZING!,"Stayed at this amazing hotel with all it's amazing staff in May. The best way to sum up our experience is: ""London was not on the travel list for 2019 BUT due to our stay at the Milestone this May, we are looking into booking for May 2019 and the Milestone is a must!"".    The level of details and care, the attention to details that the staff puts into each and every guest stay is so amazing it is beyond my comprehension. I just soaked it all up and loved every second of  being made to feel like i was someone important. I highly recommend having cocktails at their chic, cozy, classy little bar- we got the smoked old fashion every night we were there. I think we started a trend the few days we were there as other guest saw us having those and ordered a few themselves. If you are…"
June 2018,Perfection,"Wow what can I say .... What a wonderful hotel, from the greeting at reception, the welcome drinks on arrival and the exceptional, attentive service from the staff on hand, at all times, this is the best hotel I have stayed in for a long while.  The location was perfect for our evening at Kensington Palace and breakfast the next morning was excellent.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who loves perfection ... We will definitely be back soon."
May 2018,Best Birthday Afternoon Tea ever!,"While staying with friends in London in May, we booked an Afternoon tea experience here.  It was fabulous & we all felt like royalty throughout the 2 hr event.  The beauty of the hotel was matched by the fabulous staff.  After toasting with champagne, the food arrived, with lovely presentation.  The hardest part was what tea to choose!  They also presented a birthday cake, with the appropriate singing, as a special surprise! We had mentioned that we would like to view some of the other parts of this magnificent hotel and Pedro graciously lead us on a tour.  He was full of information and we even saw 2 of their suites which were lovely.  (Thank you so much Pedro!).  Steve, the Doorman,  kept us entertained as we were taking pictures.  (Hope you caught a fish the next day!)  This…"
October 2017,Magnificent Accomodation at the SW Hyde Park Entrance,Amazing hotel!  Service is top notch - there is literally nothing they will not do for you. Amazing staff!  Hotel interior looks a bit dated but as I heard it is due for a major renovation. The pool could be larger and it would be nice to have a sauna or two.  Breakfast was magnificent - everything top notch.  Great for couples and solo women travellers!
May 2018,London Luxury,"My husband and I just returned from our trip to Great Britain. This is my first review of a hotel. I cannot begin to describe our stay at The Milestone...the hotel, location and accommodations, could speak for itself. It was the staff that made this hotel stand out from the numerous other “5 star” hotels we have stayed at. The attention to detail is what makes The Milestone so special. We happened to be there the weekend of the royal wedding. Every night they would surprise us with special treats during turn down. The eve of the wedding they had two little three tiered cakes (same flavor as Harry’s wedding cake) in our room inviting us to join them in watching the Royal nuptials downstairs with the other guest! The staff, from bartenders to doormen, all referred to us by name…"
May 2018,London home!,"I've been staying at The Milestone for years now, whenever I come into London for a nice long weekend of shopping or fun - its been so long it feels like my home away from home at this point. I usually get a better room rate by calling the hotel directly. They have a nice fitness center, indoor pool, spa, and fantastic restaurant. Favourite hotel in London without a doubt."
May 2018,Best of the Best... London Hotels,"Great location across from Kensington Gardens and a short walk to the Palace. An excellent hotel with a most attentive staff. I liked the very comfortable room, the dining room, and the service that was received. It was a most memorable stay."
August 2018,Excellent in every way,"Having stayed in other Red Carnation properties in London, I decided that we would make our first visit to The Milestone to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday. I was confident we would be well looked after, but our expectations were exceeded once again.   After the warm welcome at the door and friendly check-in, Pedro gave us a guided tour. Having arrived early, we were glad to have time for lunch and shared a delicious club sandwich in the Stables bar before being introduced to our room.   As ever, the room was beautifully appointed and decorated with a comfortable bed and a good shower. Within minutes a knock at the door brought a welcome card from the Manager, and a gift box of homemade cookies from the chef.  We returned to the Stables bar for a cocktail before heading out to…"
June 2018,Amazing boutique hotel in Kensington,"I want to start off by saying i researched a lot of hotels before choosing the Milestone. We always stay at nice hotels, however much bigger in size typically. I was curious why this hotel was ranked so high. I don't believe the photo's do it justice.  before i start i want to point out that our experience at the hotel was worth a 5 star! the only reason i gave it 4 stars was because once we got home 14 days later from a cruise, they charged me for using the mini bar! it was like 50 Euro in my room, and 75 euro in our other room. (we had two rooms) we never even opened the fridge. We felt like this ruined our awesome experience in a way and is the only reason for the four star rating. they did reimburse us after a few emails, but i typically don't watch my credit card statement…"
September 2017,Perfect,"Exactly what you would expect from a London hotel. Directly across from Kensington Palace. Terrific bar downstairs. Super comfortable bed, room. It has a thoroughly british feel. Service impeccable. most highly recommended."
August 2018,Bangin!!!,"Visited the Milestone tonight for the second time and somehow the experience was even better than the first! I arrived before my mate and sat in the Stables Bar and had the great pleasure of being served by Leo who was so stellar! I initially opted for a rosé champagne, but after asking to take a glance at the cocktail menu Leo asked (as if psychic) “do you like tequila?” I, a huge fan of tequila, nodded with enthusiasm and Leo said he’d get me a Beso Nuevo- one of the bar’s bespoke Patron cocktails made with champagne. To top it off, he said he’d make it especially with rosé champagne! When the drink arrived (on a tray of rose petals of course) I took one sip and was transported to some sort of pink heaven. The rest of the meal arrived (a chopped salad and some kadaif encrusted…"
July 2018,Trip down memory lane,"This was a much anticipated and long overdue return visit to this incredibly special hotel. It was a joy to find that everything was just as we remembered it - best described as a country manor house in the heart of London, full of olde world charm and impeccable hospitality. We couldn’t have wished or asked for more from our visit, with every effort to make our visit an enjoyable one - we have fallen in love with the Milestone all over again and cannot wait to return again very soon. A special THANKYOU goes out to Grant, food and beverages manager, whose genuinely warm welcome, generosity of time and attention to detail made our visit a truly memorable one. This is an absolute must for anyone wanting a fine dining experience with first class service in beautiful surroundings."
July 2018,Very Special High Tea,"My family had a very special high tea at the Milestone today. From the minute we walked in the door all the staff, especially Tim, made us feel so welcome. They went out of there way to ensure my daughter had a great time. The food and service was excellent. I would highly recommend to anyone!"
July 2018,Make you feel welcomed and comfortable,"The staff was very welcoming and professional.  Pedro and Jose went above and beyond their duties to accommodate, as did the rest of the staff.  Room was clean and comfortable, good location to walk around and see the sights!"
June 2018,Luxury in Abundance,"The Milestone hotel is a wonderful gem! Just across from Kensington Palace/gardens, you cannot ask for a better location, and within easy access to the tube to explore other areas in London. From the moment you arrive, you are treated like royalty. Your every need is anticipated by the staff before you even realize you have one. Our room was delightful, and every evening there was a little gift at turndown service. It's those small details that made our stay amazing. No 2 rooms are alike, they each have their own charm and personality, something I truly enjoy.  A huge thank you to Andres, Fran, Nik and Magda for going the extra mile, time and again to make our stay the best one yet in London. We will surely be back!"
July 2018,Amazing hotel and the perfect venue for an intimate wedding,"My wife and I decided the Milestone would be our perfect venue to get married in a small ceremony with our closest family. It didn't disappoint in any way. We have both stayed in top end hotels before but the service and genuine care taken by Milestone staff is unparalleled.  Everything was perfect on the day, all the little details they took care of made it a very special occasion. Every member of staff was brilliant, the food was amazing and the rooms were faultless. Every member of our families felt the same and none of us can speak highly enough of the service we received. We expected big things but even those were surpassed.  In short, whether it is for your wedding, a holiday or just a one-night stay, we highly recommend this wonderful hotel!"
February 2018,Lovely weekend in London,"I stayed here with my little girl on a half-term trip to London. The hotel is beautiful and the staff are simply the best. A nice added touch was that they all had learned our names and greeted us personally whenever we went in or out. We had high tea in the restaurant - one kids and one adult, though we could have probably both shared the children’s version and been stuffed! (They did helpfully box it all up and take it back to the room for later.) The cakes and little sandwiches are just amazing and we also did the cupcake decorating. The lady who helped us was very patient with my little girl, who wanted to make the tallest cupcake ‘in the world’, which was quite a slow process. :) There are games and bits you can borrow from the hotel. I phoned down to ask for Scrabble and…"
May 2018,An incredible stay,"Ever since returning home, I just cannot stop raving to everyone I come across about my time at the Milestone Hotel. I have quite literally created this TripAdvisor account just to share my experience. It is that outstanding.   The staff at the hotel is unlike any I have experienced anywhere else in the world. Genuinely warm, helpful, and caring. The pride that they take in their work at the hotel shines through and is infectious. This of course all starts at the top. I had the pleasure of interacting with Andrew, the General Manager of the hotel, who greeted guests by name and did everything in his power to make sure that our experience in London was magical.   The breakfast every morning was some of the best food that I have found in London. I must also recommend the afternoon…"
April 2018,Best Breakfast during our Stay in Great Britain,"My wife and I had breakfast here based on a recommendation. The restaurant is small and primarily caters to hotel guests so we had to sit in their parlour (very nice and comfortable). In short, this was the best breakfast and service we had during our stay in Great Britain. The continental part, included a number of different breads & pastries, cereals, yogurts, and juices. Their croissants (my favorite) were especially noteworthy. My wife also had eggs Benedict which she really liked. I had the English breakfast which included 2 eggs, potatoes, sausage, bacon, and blood sausage. For drinks, I had juice and coffee and my wife juice and tea. WE stayed over 1 1/2 hours and were not rushed in any way. Service was impeccable - they made you feel like royalty.     Definitely will…"
May 2018,Excellent Hotel,"An excellent hotel with a most attentive staff. We liked the room, the dining room, and the service we received and plan to stay there whenever we are in London in the future.The concierge and doorman were especially helpful in making reservations (former) for restaurants and touring and finding taxis (latter)."
May 2018,Best Afternoon Tea in London,"I live in London and love afternoon tea, and this is the best place I've been. Beautiful surroundings, excellent service, incredible food. They do everything they can to make your visit special - they let my 7yo decorate her own cupcake. And as we were leaving, it was pouring with rain and they *gave* us an umbrella! Just gave it to us!   I loved it will definitely be going again."
May 2018,Best hotel  in London ,"The Milestone Hotel is in my opinion the best place to stay in London. Everything from the welcome we received , to the food we ate ,  to the beautiful rooms we had the pleasure of staying in was faultless and absolutely excellent. We were treated like royalty and cannot wait to go back . The afternoon tea is exceptional and so is the breakfast. I would 100% recommend this wonderful hotel . "
May 2018,Today's Royal Wedding Giveaway!,"By Gods Grace,   I was 1 of 5 lucky winners on the Today show picked to attend the Royal wedding in London, and to stay at the breathtaking, exceptional customers service, and overall Gem .   The head of the opulent 56 all suite luxury hotel is Andrew... He always greeted you with the biggest smile, warmest hugs, and loudest laughs. There never was a no during a stay, simply more so ""let make that happen"".    We experience only the best of the best... From Caviar sandwich's and English Tea at High Noon, Triple Chocolate Ganache, with raspberry mousse on the side. etc etc etc...   Wake up calls came with Fresh hot tea , shortbread and a sweet note... One of the very personal touches that I love about this place is all the fresh flower... Most of all the flowers are Red , but you…"
May 2018,Likely to Return,"London is so big that often your choice of hotel is determined by what part of it you plan on visiting. This is in a prime location for luxury tourism, at the corner of Kensington Gardens. All the top stores and many top restaurants are within 1 mile. Of course you have Princess Di’s Kensington Palace across the street.  We liked the hotel’s small scale and cozy, intimate feel. But no expense has been spared. The room was sumptuously furnished and very quiet.  The staff is enormous and well trained. That said, they neglected to clean our room one day until we returned and brought it to our attention. And what was the point of inquiring at check-in whether I would like a newspaper and then not delivering one?  The breakfast offered a big menu in addition to a large buffet. We did…"
May 2018,Fantastic hotel,"I visit london for work regularly and I stay at many hotels in the city and this one is a really amazing one. I love the boutique hotel design and the decorations has  a clear personality, details everywhere, refine luxury with a distinctive British stile. Amazing rooms !!! The service is also amazing and the food experience was also incredible. I will be back for sure "
May 2018,"Sumptuous Surroundings, Incredible Staff, Perfect Location",We recently visited and were so delighted with everything about this beautiful property. Can't say enough good things about the staff; concierges were friendly and knowledgeable; wonderful historic building; lovely buffet or full breakfast; delicious meals attentively served; exquisite decor throughout with every convenience; black and white conservatory is stunning; located directly across from Kensington Gardens and Palace and convenient to much of London's sights.  We can't wait to go back.  Many thanks to each and every one who made our stay so perfect!
May 2018,An Amazing Experience,"From the minute I arrived at the MIlestone the staff treated me like family and went out of their way to make me feel comfortable. They rushed my room so I could get in mid day, brought me tea and offered to do anything they could to make me more comfortable. I thought this impeccable service was just a lovely way to greet me but it lasted all four days I stayed there! Every morning a latte was delivered to my room and wherever I went in this very charming boutique hotel someone was there to lend me a hand! I can not recommend this hotel enough if you are going to London. I have stayed at many lovely spots but The Milestone really takes the cake! The room was well appointed and so comfortable. It was very difficult to leave. Honestly the finest experience I have ever had in…"
April 2018,Ms. Kathy Mohr,"Absolutely the most excellent service. Beautiful accommodations, friendly and caring staff. They go the extra mile to take care of you and make you feel at home. My daughter and I will definitely return here and consider them home away from home."
May 2018,"Absolutely lovely, perfect ","Some things are hard to express that's also the stay at this hotel. Words are not enough for the experience one gets here.  The rooms are perfect, we stayed in the smallest queen room and whilst it being tight with the space it's so cosy! The bathroom is large though and turning on the roof shower is just magical. 5 stars are 5 stars here, from body products to robes, chocolates to hand written welcome messages it's all there.   I can absolutely recommend the taxi service the hotel offers too, whilst more expensive then normal the experience and quality is fantastic. Afternoon tea needs to be experienced and is a real treat, 2 hours quickly fly by.  One thing I want to mention, we are a couple enjoying a fancy trip for once and when the staff noticed the ease and openness we…"
April 2018,Superior in EVERY way,"This is my second review of The Milestone.  We first visited twice in 2017 and returned in March and April of 2018.  First, the staff is superior.  We did not expect to return to the U.K. after 2017  due to canine vaccination requirements.  I explained this to the staff when we left, that we could not return.  Considering this, I couldn’t believe that so many of them remembered my name and the name of my DOG almost one year later.  It is easy to assume that they read a client list or were provided with client cards but in all fairness, most of them were visibly surprised to see us arrive.  They remembered the small things such as my final farewell when we last parted, the make and model of my rental car from the previous year, and other various aspects specific to me and my…"
April 2018,A Special place!,We had four nights at this very superior hotel as part of our special overseas trip.  The hotel is visually spectacular in every way & in every nook & cranny. The decor & furnishings are truly  regal & plush. Our room was very beautiful with a small staircase up to the bedroom area from the doorway & bathroom. There was good storage space & a very comfortable king size bed. We were at first surprised there was no tea making facilities but that was quickly remedied. The bathroom was large with shower over the bath but not much storage space for makeup or toiletries as the only shelf was full of items from the hotel. Towel supply was abundant & thick & fluffy.  The only issue we had with the bathroom was the shower over the bath. I would normally specify a walk in shower but I had…
April 2018,"Charming, discreet and excellent red-brick 5-star in Kensington","As the final “leg” of a “bucket-list” road trip of the UK West Country, I had decided to spend 3 nights in London at a 5-star property to conclude my 3 week odyssey in the lap of luxury.  I wont even mention the half dozen or so of the usual suspects that entered my head but, when thinking of what I hoped to achieve during these final days, I realised that re-visiting my old stomping grounds of Notting Hill & Kensington where I had lived in a flat (in NH) for several years during the mid 70s whilst working in London was going to be my #1 priority. There were, of course, many options in the area including some big-name modern-ish places but I was determined to stay in a hotel which typified the red-brick classic charm of a traditional late 19th century, established property.  The…"
April 2018,A home you wouldn’t want to step out. Be treated like royalty.,"We spent a few nights in the Paris Suite at The Milestone Hotel and Residences. The suite was luxurious with well thought through touches. Nothing was missed out. Our charging cables were all over the place and Housekeeping velcroed them tidy.   The Penhaligon toiletries were fabulous and upon checking in a butler came to our room and offered a selection of Crabtree & Evelyn full sized body soaps to use during our stay.   There were two bathrooms in the room. One fitted with a WC, bathtub and two wash basins and another with a shower and WC. The bedroom window overlooks Kensington Park and Palace.    I like the resistance pool and gym in the basement. It is also where the spa is.  Two private showers are located here and L’occitane toiletries with plush towels and bedroom…"
April 2018,Brilliant London retreat,"Wonderful hotel and staff in a lovely part of London, ideally located for Kensington Palace, Hyde Park and the Royal Albert Hall with Harrods only a 20 minute walk away or 5 minutes by cab. Great local restaurants and cafes."
April 2018,Indescribably Wonderful!,"Words almost escape me when thinking about my stay at The Milestone Hotel last week.  The opening welcome from the doorman set the tone for a fantastic stay. Each staff member really outdid themselves to extend that welcome throughout our 5 day trip.   The food in the dining room and my single experience with room service was delicious. Overall the service was quiet, effortless and excellent.  The Milestone is located across the street from Hyde Park and we looked across at Kensington Palace from our 5th floor room.   I would stay again in a heartbeat and will recommend to all my friends who visit London."
April 2018,Fabulous hotel!,The Milestone Hotel is in a wonderful location away from the hustle bustle of Piccadilly but a short cab ride to all the major attractions.  It is located across the street from Kensington Palace and the lovely gardens of Hyde Park. A boutique hotel filled with old world charm.  The staff is outstanding and ready to help with anything you might want or need.  Great concierge service too.  The breakfast room is delightful and the food delicious.  Did not have the Afternoon Tea but it is in the charming sitting room and looked lovely.  Rooms comfortable and well appointed.  A definite place for your next stay in London!!
April 2018,Magnificent Milestone!,"Not only are the rooms and restaurants exceptionally beautiful but the staff is the best I've ever encountered. Tim, Connor, Laura and especially Waddie are so gracious, thoughtful, accommodating and professional. I love this hotel and if not staying here I will make a point to stop in to say ""Hello"" to the outstanding staff."
April 2018,OUTSTANDING,"The most incredible experience ever.  What fabulous staff.. thank you to Leo, Peggy, Nuala, Nik, Connor, Tim, Giacomo times two, Angelo, Wadie , Jose and Steve and the whole team... NEVER HAVE WE EVER ... can’t wait to come back. We have stayed in some magnificent hotels in our lifetime. Some 7 star rated hotels and the MILESTONE far surpasses any of those experiences. HIGHLY RECOMMEND it..."
April 2018,No complaints,"Friendly helpful staff, quiet clean rooms and good food, near to museums and galleries,  decent transport links to central London and further afield. The area has lots of shops and restaurants nearby and is interesting to walk around."
April 2018,Perfect a Second Time,"We stayed at this hotel last year and when we decided to go back to London, The Milestone was the natural choice.  The service provided by the hotel staff is far superior to any previous experiences.  They greet their guests by name and are always willing to be of service. The staff is the epitome of graciousness and professionalism.  The rooms are lovely and very clean and well kept.  The location is great, with many fine restaurants near by. We hope to return."
March 2018,I am in love with this hotel!,"Milestone is one of the rarest and most beautiful hotels in Kensington. It is charming, unique, atmospheric and top quality. I have been coming here on different occasions for many years and I also experienced the afternoon tea. I can say that the staff in the hotel is absolutely wonderful. They make you feel at home, very cosy, appreciated and looked after. I remember the lovely lady called Malina and a gentleman Augustine. What I love especially is the pianist Malcolm who plays wonderful music in the evenings. It is a true pleasure to be at this hotel! A wide selection of teas, food dishes, drinks and everything you can dream of. Very worth visiting if you want a sense of comfort, luxury, old English style and impreccable service. Thank you!"
April 2018,Perfect Afternoon Tea with excellent service,"I do love a good afternoon tea and I'm slowly moving around the elegant hotels in London sampling afternoon tea, one hotel at a time!   I've been to several LHW including Ritz, Landmark, Cafe Royal & Browns so to tick The Milestone off the list was a welcomed treat.  It was a belated Mothers Day treat and on arrival we were greeted by Tim (concierge), a very warm welcome and he acknowledge to my mum that she hoped she was a having a lovely belated Mothers Day.  We sat in the lounge and had a lovely corner table by the window, just perfect. We went for the Royal Afternoon Tea, for an upgrade of £1 from the champagne afternoon tea you got strawberries and cream and 1/2 bottle of champagne.  Our waitress was Aysha, she recommend teas for my mum who for the first time was trying…"
March 2018,Perfect afternoon tea with a toddler!,"Our afternoon tea yesterday was absolutely fab. There are few places that cater so very well for a very small person (2.5 years old) so you can sometimes feel a little on edge taking them to certain places. However, absolutely no worries about that here, our son was treated like a prince - even being treated to his 'little prince' tea. Thank you for letting him decorate his own cupcake and for looking after him so it really felt like a family afternoon out rather than dragging him where we wanted to go! We will be back."
March 2018,The Milestone Hotel - a true gem!  My new #1 choice in London.,"To echo the well articulated reviews on The Milestone - this establishment is truly remarkable.  We just completed a 3 night stay over Easter weekend and the service quality and attention to detail was well beyond expectations.  From our welcome tour of the hotel with the butler, special touches from the turndown staff including a small army of chocolate Easter bunnies and other assortments each night, Afternoon Tea that was everything you would ever hoped it would be as a non Afternoon tea crowd, three separate fantastic breakfasts where the menu choices are broad and well executed, and one extraordinary dinner at Cheneston's, to the warm greetings at our every departure and return - the whole staff deserves special recognition for their level of execution.  Stayed at another…"
April 2018,Marvelous Milestone,"We spent 2  nights at this wonderful hotel. Staff were very attentive, friendly and always had a smile. Our stay was during the Easter Weekend. The Hotel had delicious displays of Chocolate Bunnies and eggs all over and we were treated to 2 Chocolate bunnies on our pillows at turn down. The attention to detail at the Red Carnation Hotels really makes guests feel special. Jose at the Concierge was most helpful and informative and so was Nik at Reception. Thank you for making our stay a memorable one. Looking forward to our next visit.   "
March 2018,Simply the best in London Kensington,"rooms and suites have charactor. good food and good service.   Breakfast is one of the best in london, very fresh yet healthy. The chicken sandwich of the afternoon tea is the most unique and tasty.   Location is superb, and perfect for business events."
March 2018,The Milestone Hotel -- outstanding experience from start to finish,"My first visit to the Milestone surpassed my wildest expectations.  Somehow the staff seem to know what you want before even you know it -- and they are a constant, happy presence on the property. I couldn't have been more pleased with the service I received, or the beautiful, spacious suite in which I stayed.  A few highlights for me:  Fiona Keane -- book a massage or spa treatment with her at your first opportunity. I had what she described as a 'relaxing massage,' (and what I described as 'the best massage I have ever had, hands down). She put me in an absolute trance, and I can only describe her work as miraculous! I will seek her out the next time I come to London.  The Milestone's restaurant, Cheneston's, was incredible. I sat at a cozy table next to a roaring fire (it was…"
April 2018,Stay in London,My wife and I recently stayed at the Milestone Hotel for about a week while in London. The entire hotel staff was terrific and the stay was great. This is a class hotel - the restaurant was 5 star and I would highly recommend if you are looking for a romantic white table cloth evening. One highlight were the best martinis we had ever had at their bar - we actually wrote back and  they gave us their recipe. If you are looking for a memorable visit stay at the Milestone.
May 2018,"Beautiful, great location, fabulous staff",My wife and I have experienced a number of other 5 star hotels in London and we choose to keep coming back to the milestone.   It is thoughtfully and beautifully decorated maintaining the character of the hotel.   The staff are welcoming attentive and go to great lenghths to make you feel special and your visit perfect.  The luxury king and delux studios are both nice with the studio having more space.  It has a great location directly across from Kensington palace/park.  We look forward to our next trip.
May 2018,Fabulous facility and staff,"We recently enjoyed four nights at the Milestone, and enjoyed every minute. The staff is incredibly friendly and proefessional. The breakfast food and service was superb. They went out of their way at every turn to ensure our stay was memorable. True luxury across the board!"
May 2018,Exceptional experience in an hotel filled with class,"The Milestone was filled with character, class and a quality second to none. Everything was tastefully done with each part of the hotel promoting the aforementioned. The variation in the rooms offered created a choice for the client which catered for everyone's needs without compromise. The staff were also excellent across the board with any request being dealt with efficiently and with an air of friendliness-nothing was too much trouble. We were upgraded from the luxury king room to a delux studio which was great. We are now about to book another stay in August."
May 2018,Classy,"We came in late one night for cocktails, and left very satisfied, wish we had come earlier.  Waiting staff were very friendly, and made us feel at home, putting on music and chatting with us.  Would love to come back soon."
May 2018,Wonderful Experience,"The Milestone Hotel is a true gem.  The hotel and staff are second to none.  The service was perfect.  Leo, Laura, Angelo, Giacomo were outstanding.  Everyone gave such personalized attention to me that at times I felt like the only guest.  Keep up the great work! Sam"
April 2018,Perfection,"It is obvious from the moment you step from the car that the staff here strives for perfection and it is achieved! Beginning with the butler, Francis, who was charming and utterly welcoming. We loved our quiet room with the spacious bath. The breakfast was absolutely outstanding with wonderful service from Sandra. In the evenings the bar was small, but so much fun!! Watching the cocktails get mixed was such a fun show, try the ‘Smokey Old Fashioned’, wow! Need a great black taxi? Steve is your man! This doorman is the employee that puts this lovely, lovely hotel above all others! We had the most wonderful 6 night stay here, fabulous!"
May 2018,A Lovely Place in London,"We spent 2-9 May at the Milestone in room 408.  Milestone is one of the best hotels we have stayed in 39 years of travel together.  It was indeed perfect.  The entire staff is a delight.  They were excellent in every way.  We loved the restaurant and bar food, too.  If you want a lovely stay, you must experience The Milestone Hotel.  Great location and two blocks from the tube."
April 2018,Felt like a Queen!,"What can't I say about the Milestone. The attention to detail and personalized service is top notch. I felt like I was the only guest in the hotel. From the doorman Patrico to the bartenders in the cozy stable bar to the concierge, wait staff and desk staff. Everything was just lovely and I cannot wait to return!"
May 2018,Above and beyond,The staff at milestone go above and beyond. The concierge Sonny and Connor were amazing! They met every one of our needs and more!! Travelling with 2 kids under 2 made easy thanks to these guys! Nothing we asked for was too much. I would highly recommend The Milestone Hotel ☆☆☆☆☆
March 2018,Near perfect!,"Exemplary service - from our initial welcome, being shown to our room, receiving our welcome drinks - the whole experience surpasses expectations and creates a fantastic experience.  This is my 3rd try if a Red Carnation hotel group chain - all have been brilliant   We had a lovely little room overlooking the park - perfect!  The bathroom was small, the shower was a small cubicle - but all presented beautifully.  We went out for the night and came back to lovely treats - again, all wonderful.  Then I tried to sleep.  I don't know if the walls are thin, or if it was next door being loud, but I ended up knocking on the wall at 1:30am because I could hear their tv perfectly and couldn't get to sleep.  They turned it down, went to sleep, then they and one or two rooms on our corner…"
March 2018,The Milestone Hotel... WOW!!!,"I am a person who is very much set in their ways and don’t welcome change.However, last Friday was my girlfriends Birthday and i decided to step away from our usual hotel of the Lanesborough or The Berkeley and I did some research online. This hotel came up as one of the top 10 most romantic Hotels in London.  Let me tell you it did not disappoint! from the moment we pulled up outside we were welcomed by a charming gentleman who made us feel instantly at home. Upon check in we were told that they had upgraded us to one of their most beautiful suites.. ( it was stunning and certainly one of the nicest rooms I have seen in London). We were then greeted by the hotels manager Leo who was enthusiastic and vert professional. They made the stay memorable from a beautiful strawberry…"
March 2018,Exceptional Massage Therapist at The Milestone,"I arrived at The Milestone Hotel on a flying visit from Australia, bent and immobile with lower back pain. The hotel is lovely, with possibly the warmest and most welcoming staff of any hotel I have stayed in (Nuala was exceptional). However, this review is about Fiona Keane, the massage therapist who treated me at the hotel. Fiona treated me twice during my brief visit, with extraordinary results. Her assessment of my problem was spot on, and her treatment thorough, extremely effective and even enjoyable (which isn't always a given!). She advised me as to what I needed to do to address my problem in the immediate and longer term, and since my return to Australia has been in contact to check how I am doing. In my experience, this level of treatment is exceptional, and I cannot…"
March 2018,Absolutely Fabulous,"The hotel was charming, very clean and had a good vibe.  The staff was overwhelming wonderful on every level without being intrusive. The bed and linens were extraordinaire.  We highly recommend The Milestone London to London travelers and locals for The Stable Bar.  "
March 2018,Amazing hotel,"What an amazing old hotel, impeccable service and unbeatable location, there is nothing they could improve. Yes it’s an old building being adapted to modern demands but there is nothing they could do better, we have stayed in many top hotels and this one is hard to beat - so much character and the staff are wonderful, The location is fantastic, close to the tube and across the road from Kensington Palace, can’t think of anywhere else I would want to stay in London."
March 2018,Wonderful stay!,"My best friend and I stayed here for 4 days and loved it! The location is perfect with lots of sights and great restaurants within walking distance. The Park is across the street and Whole Foods is a block away. The staff is really amazing- darling Peggy checked us in and took care of us for the rest of our stay, checking in with us daily. I had emailed concierge Tim prior to our visit and he was so responsive and helpful- beforehand and during our stay. Doorman Steve was a doll- helping us through the crazy snow each day and trying to retrieve our lost Uber driver- Steve went above and beyond. Davide and Grant were so personal and took great care of us at tea time and meals. The food is delicious- particularly breakfast. Our twin bedded room was perfectly appointed with 2…"
December 2017,Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!,"My friend and I stayed at the classic luxurious hotel on 11th of Dec to 15th of Dec, 2017. We have a pleasant stay at the hotel. Staff are so friendly and helpful, especially the professional Dutch young man (sorry I forgot his name) at the concierge. The room is spotless and everything in details, The housekeeper also wrapped our USB cables neat and tidy. We will stay in again in the future. Thanks 👍👍"
March 2018,I Really Want  To Like This Hotel,"Everyone loves this place. It is in a fantastic location, impeccably designed and furnished. Nice friendly folks. Yet I have stayed here twice and I just can’t warm up to it. It’s mostly the little things—bad water pressure in the bathroom sink, too much furniture in the room etc. the furniture issue is because in their quest to make it “British” they put two big chairs in front of the TV so you cannot watch from the bed. It makes the nice room crowded. A missed wake up call, too salty soup, uninspired sandwiches, an hour later for a replacement remote make up my stay. I did write an evaluation and Andrew Pike the GM got right back to me with apologize and offer of a free room next stay. Classy! So maybe I am just too picky. Anyway I will give it another try but cannot recommend…"
April 2017,boutique luxury hotel,"I have traveled most of the world, and as most of my reviews (past and future) read, luxury is a must, the Milestone hotel took it a step further.  no matter how you travel, you will always feel special in the hotel, it is beyond amazing, no room is like the other, each has its unique design and decor which adds more of a wow factor. the staff are on a whole other level, i have been to so many hotels, but i can't see myself going to any other place when i am in London Other: great location, Staff, rooms, tea time, restaurants near by, shops near by. and much more."
March 2018,My New Favorite Hotel!,"I have stayed in luxurious and not-so-luxurious hotels for more than 50 years all over the world, and my new fave— in the luxury category— is the Milestone in London. Why? It has a sense of history and tradition; each room is decorated beautifully in a unique and colorful style that combines the traditional with the whimsical; the staff is genuinely welcoming and helpful; the service is efficient to the nth degree— and at the Milestone I feel as if I am staying in a hotel version of Downton Abbey!"
October 2017,Milestone Hotel,"A wonderful experience. Fantastic room and amazing service. Great facilities. Live entertainment in the evenings.Close to Hyde Park, shopping , buses and metro. Thoroughly recommend. Best boutique hotel ever."
November 2017,This is one of the best boutique luxury hotels in the world,"I have been visiting the Milestone Hotel for more than ten years now, but it had been a couple of years since my last visit for a variety of reasons. Upon my return, I was reminded that this is one of the best luxury boutique hotels in the world. It is just fabulous in every way. Every member of the staff goes above and beyond: Doorman, front desk, waiters in the bar, room service and housekeeping (I had the loveliest conversation with one of the maids when I asked where she was from.) In the bar when I was really tired and was going to have a glass of wine before going to bed, they brought me special snacks. The doorman offered me an umbrella when it was lightly raining. The front desk was charming and welcoming. The rooms are lovely, the spaces are warm and wonderfully…"
July 2017,Fabulous hiotel,Great food and service- lovely bar and breakfast room Location is one of the best in London- walking by distance to Kensington Palace and Harrod's! Great restaurants in the neighborhood and wonderful sights.
November 2017,Excellent afternoon tea ,"My wife and I had a wonderful afternoon tea today at the Milestone. It was a surprise for my wife's birthday tomorrow and the staff made her feel very special, even bringing a cake and candle with happy birthday! The service was very personal and the food excellent, the surroundings and decor were intimate. We would thoroughly recommend the Milestone and hope to be back soon! Thank you."
October 2017,Well situated across from Kensington Palace. Great Service,"This was a lovely boutique hotel directly across from Kensington Palace. The staff was fabulous-almost too solicitous. My room was very, very nice with great amenities. Breakfast was terrific. The concierge was one of the best as he was knowledgeable as well as friendly. I would compare this hotel to some of the finest in London and rate it quite highly. My only ""beef"" was that my room was not ready for the early check- in that overseas guests need.  However, for a 100 pound upgrade there would be a room ready. I decided  to wait which was only for 30 minutes during which time they nicely gave me some coffee. I would recommend this hotel and I would certainly return. Very expensive."
November 2017,Afternoon Tea,"My family and I spent a couple of hours at this marvellous hotel. We arrived a little bit earlier by taxi, and was greeted by their doorman. Since we arrived ca 40 min earlier I asked him where the nearest pub was located. He told us not to bother with that one, but if we could make the effort of walking a couple of minutes he could recommend one. Then he said “as a matter of fact I show you the way” Three minutes later we arrived at the pub, while showing us the way he told us a few interesting things about the neighbourhood. FIRST CLASS SERVICE! Btw the Afternoon Tea was excellent and the staff was top notch. Highly recommended. "
November 2017,beautiful boutique hotel,"We stayed here as an experience gift from my sister so we had a package with dinner and breakfast as well as a beautiful room for the evening.  The Milestone is a classic classy hotel. The room had one of the biggest tv's I've seen in a hotel for a long time, a comfy bed, nice bathroom with lovely toiletries and nice big towel."
October 2017,Heaven missed,"I don't visit London often...... big mistake...... I didn't revisit my favourite and stay at the Milestone Please don't make make the same mistake. There is only one hotel that offers beautiful individually appointed bedrooms, restaurants, relaxed areas, cloakrooms and even corridors!!! Staff who are chosen for their professionalism. One is made to feel soooo very welcome. Peggy, Connor and Tim on the welcome desk reminded me I had made such a HUGE mistake not staying with them.  My other favourite being d'Angleterre in Geneva. The Red Carnation Group have Service tapped Location, location.... easy for most things needed See you soon dearest Milestone"
October 2017,Warm ambiance and attentive staff to the smallest detail.,"The room is  an amazing Master Suite with lovely windows overlooking Kensington Park. The furniture is very warm and the amenities are perfect. The friendly, high standard of the staff and their attention to our needs is gratifying; making the Milestone our home for one week away from home."
October 2017,5 star hotel with a down to earth attitude ,"We stayed at the Milestone to go to the Royal Albert Hall. It was a five minute walk so very handy. The hotel itself was delightful. They had thought of every little detail, try the aromatherapy pillows they smell lovely. The staff were very friendly and helpful. It was a great hotel for a birthday surprise. Don't forget to ask for the tea tray! "
November 2017,Excellent,"Very friendly hotel. Nice building. Beautiful architecture. Good location, close to public transport. Great menu with excellent food, especially dessert. Very good service and great staff. Clean nice comfortable room."
December 2017,Amazing staff,"As this was my first trip to London I found the Milestone staff incredibly helpful and friendly.  Having few plans for my three day visit they did everything from efficiently planning my days and providing tips on where and when to be for the best experiences, to directing me to the most delicious fish and chips in London.   The hotel itself is small and luxurious with cozy nooks throughout.  I hope to return soon."
September 2017,Lovely stat,Visited first time to London... The check-in process was so quick and they escort us to the rooms. After some rest we choose to roam the hotel the artiticture is mesmerising..we like the furniture and things that they got its is world class the hotel serve us like we did not our family. Great staff and services...food was great and even rooms was breath taking We definitely we come back
November 2017,Perfection,"This was our third stay at the Milestone and, as usual, it exceeded our expectations.  The staff are extraordinary.  They go the extra mile in all they do.  The entire hotel is immaculately kept, the food at the hotel's restaurant is excellent, and the afternoon tea is quite spectacular.  For us, there is no where else in London that we would consider staying."
November 2017,"Exclusive London hotel, a place you must try when staying in London","I have to say from the moment we entered the hotel to the last final farwell we found this hotel very welcoming, professional, amazing luxury hotel in a great location in London, with some proper old English interior. Do not expect a large modern hotel, expect a small luxury paradise instead, sometime quirky but very interesting. Our room was a great room with so many nice little gifts to welcome us, which is normal in this modern times. This place takes you back to how a hotel should be, as you will be looked after while you stay. We stayed in 204 which was a really nice quiet internal room towards the central lightwell, so nice and quiet. Highly recommended hotel. Oh, I recommend the smokey whisky, which is served in a very elegant way. Cheers!"
November 2017,Wonerful Csutomer Service,Stayed for one evening as I had a meeting nearby. Apart from the beautiful building and characterful rooms what struck me the most was the excellent service throughout the hotel. Everyone I encountered was pleasant and helpful and they seem to have really genuine staff. Great location also and highly recommended.
November 2017,Best Hotel ever ,I have been into many hotels none of them get closer to the experience I got from this hotel. Check in  Check out  breakfast  Room  Bed  Bathroom  Staff  Everythings was wright  and in it's place  I loved all the staff all of them were very polite and Willing to help me to make my visit to London the best ...  Thank u very much for all staff   U deserve to be #1 hotel in london 
November 2017,One of the best,"We arrived at the Milestone tired and weary, we left refreshed and happy. What made the difference? The staff; they make you feel at home, take a genuine interest in your welfare, go above and go beyond the expected to meet your needs. For example, we asked the concierge for the location of a good Italian restaurant. He recommended one nearby, called to make sure we could get in and had one of his assistants walk us over.  One afternoon the hotel manager greeted us by name as we waked in, asked if we were being well taken care of and we were. From the barman to the doorman, concierge and reception staff, they all go out of their way to remember who you are and make your stay an enjoyable experience.  As for the hotel’s facilities, the public areas are comfortable and plush, the…"
November 2017,Beautiful home away from home,"We returned to The Milestone again & are enjoying 6 lovely nights here. The hotel is just as good as last year, with warm & attentive service, lovely food in Cheneston's restaurant & immaculate housekeeping. We have a few more days here but want to give special thanks to Andrea, Jose & Conor, the Concierges, Teddy who greets everyone at the door with warmth & humour & Sandra in the restaurant. We'd never stay anywhere else."
November 2017,Delightful London Surprise,"First time stay at The Milestone so we did not know what to expect. Location is excellent (near Kensington Palace. Hotel is beautiful in the classic sense of Old London - heavy woodwork, leaded glass windows and fine details. The delightful surprise was the staff. WOW!!! These people are fantastic. No detail too small. No request unwelcome. We were greeted at the curb by Steve, in top hat, tails and regalia. Rain or shine, he was out front to take care of our needs. Leo at the front desk was the fixer. He jumped on any issue no matter how minuscule. Andrea the Concierge, knows everything about London. His recommendations were excellent.  David selected our wines and he knows his trade. Edgar took care of us in the dining room where the food was superb and the service impeccable.…"
October 2017,Favorite Hotel,"Favorite hotel hands down in London!!! We have been coming for years, word has got out, unfortunately. Prices have gone up.  But......it’s absolutely worth it.  Splurge for a suite if you can. Location? check!, Charm? check! Dining? check! Amazing staff? check! Feeling like you are in London? check!!!"
February 2018,Small five star hotel,"Small five star hotel opposite Kensington Gardens. Public rooms furnished in English country housecstyle. Bedrooms very comfortable, clean and well equipped. Read milk supplied in room fridge for tea and coffee making. High level of personal service. Excellent breakfasts. Dining roon very traditional with polished wood. All staff very helpful and pleasant. We will return."
February 2018,Absolutely exceptional. Made my birthday so special!,"I have been to the milestone for afternoon tea twice now. Both times I have been blown away by the absolutely exceptional service. The hotel is clearly high end, but you are made to feel so comfortable and special. The hotel knew my favourite cake, carrot and pistachio, from a review I had written before and even baked it for me as a birthday treat!  The tea itself is delicious and the park lounge is so unique - small, personal and quiet. I have been to so many places for tea but this one is tops. Anyone I have recommended it to fully agrees :) I can't thank the Milestone enough for making my birthday so special. THANK YOU!"
April 2017,Amazing! Just amazing!,"The best service, unuque and comfortable rooms, beautiful building.  Fabulous bars.  This is a classic high end London boutique hotel in two old converted townhouses. Good location close to Kengisington park and to shopping and the tube. Stay here!"
February 2018,Seamless Boutique Service... Perfection,I stayed at The Milestone for the first time with a friend last week for a mini break in London and to attend the Fashion Week Festival. The first thing that you cannot deny is the outstanding service that the staff provide. Immediately I was greeted by doorman Steve with a 'Welcome Home' smile and conversation flowed with the Concierge and Front of House team from there.  I was shown around the hotel to familiarise myself with the facilities and was greeted with kindness by the GM Mr Pike. I believe it was a young girl called Penny or Peggy(!?) who showed me around and she was so gracious and enthusiastic about the hotel - it was the brief history lesson of the building and charming stories of the past that made you feel like you were part of something special.   My room was…
February 2018,Sets the standard for excellence,"Stayed here last weekend and had a terrific time. Hotel staff are exceptionally good. Room was very welcoming and well appointed and attention to detail was evident in all aspects. Had dinner on the Friday night - the dining room is very small but the food and the service were both top notch. Try the dover sole if its on the menu, it was superb.  If you have a car then use the NCP across the road at the Royal Gardens Hotel. Looking forward to returning again for another stay."
February 2018,Outstanding Customer Service,Stayed here 2/9/2018 for five nights truly a step above any other hotel I've stayed at. Will always be were I stay when I go to London. The entire staff here needs two thumbs up. See you all sooner then later.
February 2018,Best hotel that I have ever stayed in! Customer service was incredible!,"The Milestone is literally my favorite hotel that I have ever stayed in.  It is impossible to put the quality of their customer service and the beauty of their grounds into words.  They truly treat their guests like royalty. I recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a perfect London experience.  It is certainly pricey, but I found the higher prices to be worth the many benefits that come with staying at the Milestone.  They also run pricing promotions throughout the year!  Pros:  -There were countless memorable aspects of our stay at the Milestone, but if I had to pick, I would say that the employees at the hotel were the most memorable part of our vacation.  They were so welcoming and personable.  They were also so happy to do anything to help make our vacation more…"
February 2018,Simply the best Hotel in London,"Though I have travelled the world and stayed in many great hotels, never before have I been compelled to write a review. The hotel itself and even more so the staff were truly astonishing. If you ever wish to be treated like a King, then this is simply the only hotel in London for you. The staff paid such attention to every little detail and in such a subtle manner. Though there were many other guests. they truly made me feel like I was the only one. Many thanks for such a fantastic stay and rest assured I intend to be back many times in the future. Jim Murphy"
February 2018,Wonderful!,"My my 4 night stay here last week was fantastic, and the service was fantastic. The room was amazing and the room service impeccable. One evening I dined in the hotel restaurant which was most enjoyable and immersive & can highly recommend the scallop starter and venison mains.   The staff went out of their way to ensure I had  pleasant stay - even when I mentioned that I had back trouble and had to stretch regularly, they even left a yoga DVD and player in the room. Before I left they ensured I had a hot beverage (it was about 2 degrees outside). Very thoughtful.   The staff were as tentative as anywhere I've been... ever! Location is top notch and right across from Kensington park. All in all it was a delightful stay and would highly recommend this hotel."
February 2018,Service will leave you speachless!,"This hotel is simply incredible.  Was my mothers first time out of the country, and she accompanied me while I did some business.  Wanted her to have a real British experience, but never anticipated the greatness that is the Milestone. I've stayed at many 5 star hotels, and yet this one creates a new 10th star in my book.  Not only was every detail covered, but details I would never think of were covered.  EVERY staff member is amazing, but my mom fell in love with her bartender friend Angelo. Every staff member knew our names by the end of just the first day.  The details in service blew me away on our last night yesterday.  We were running short on time and I asked Jose and Connor where I could get my little guy at home a Paddington Bear without taking a train ride to…"
February 2018,Cosy elegance with first class service,"We had a fabulous stay. My wife and daughter were in London to see a show and the hotel helped to make the trip so much more special. The staff were all, without exception, superb, helpful and genuinely friendly. The room had a view over the park with Kensington Palace dominating. So much so we were inspired to visit the Diana exhibition there that morning. Lyla loved to be in the room where Queen Victoria was born, and another where she was told she was Queen.  The room was spacious and yet cosy. All the small touches which separate a truly exceptional hotel from a great one. The notes, the robes and slippers laid out, the treats. The supplied bedtime reading was a new and very charming perk. The sofa bed for our daughter was soft and huge, she was out like a light. I would…"
October 2017,Luxury and Lovely,I highly recommend The Milestone hotel. Great staff and fantastic hospitality. Very charming and classy rooms. Location is great near to Kensington Palace. I have very pleasant stay and great time and memories. It's gonna be my first choice whenever I am in London again.
December 2017,Luxury and charm!,"I'd absolutely recommend and stay at the Milestone again! From the minute you walk in the door, you are treated with absolute care. The staff is unfailingly friendly and helpful and will assist you with anything you need. The rooms are warm and cozy and lovingly decorated, with comfortable beds and duvets. The bathrooms are spacious for London (though the shower heads are a bit weird, honestly, because you can't adjust them); the toiletries are lovely (I especially loved the lip balm). The rooms are old-fashioned, in the best way; very little noise can be heard outside your room. Breakfast was wonderful, with a continental spread and breakfast cooked to order. The cozy Stables Bar is a brilliant place to have a nightcap. We didn't have an opportunity to use the gym or the…"
January 2018,Small Quaint and Lovely,My husband and I both love the Milestone Hotel!!!  Directly across the street from Kensington Palace small quaint and the service is impeccable they are truly the consummate hosts.   If there is a service you require and they don’t have it they will find a way to get it for you.  We have both been many places and this will definitely be one of our top 5 favorite destination Accommodations.  Ben Seger and his entire staff made sure that we were completely taken care of!  
December 2017,Fantastic festive afternoon tea,"My brother booked afternoon tea as a Christmas treat for my 88 year old father. I was lucky enough to be invited along too. My parents had spent their wedding night at the Milestone 65 years ago, so it was especially poignant for him.  Both food and tea were delicious. The excellent and attentive service from Davide in the restaurant and all the other delightful members of staff made for a lovely afternoon.  Thank you very much. "
August 2017,Perfect!,From the moment you walk in you are made to feel like one of the family.The reception  and all their staff are so very friendly and relaxed. They give you all the help you need and it is obvious that this is something they enjoy doing.  The Milestone is well situated in the central area of London within an easy walk of all the main sites and attractions.
December 2017,Best service ever!,"I arrived way earlier than expected on a cold December weekday just as the first snow flakes started to fall. I had booked the hotel after I could not get into Hotel 41 which was full. I was not disappointed. The service levels from the time I arrived till I left are by far the best I had ever seen or experienced, in fact its better than the 41, which is a benchmark when it comes to service. Its the personal touch like a cup of coffee while you wait for the room in an amazing lounge thats feels like a upmarket house. Speedy assistance to get a suit pressed for the my evening function. Room well thought out with all the extras and very homely, brilliant bathroom and all very clean. There is a lot of little things for free that make the experience even better. Breakfast has a…"
October 2017,Beautiful,Lovely hotel couldn’t fault it at all. Had a lovely weekend. Will be recommending to friends and family!  Will be visiting again very soon.  Gorgeous location and not too noisy! Room was just what we had pictured and net our expectations
November 2017,Love this Home from Home!,"Entertained clients in the Oratory - a small private room which doubles up as either private dining or suitable for intimate weddings or civil ceremonies.  Amazing service and food - what more can you expect from a 5* hotel winning so many accolades!  it is expensive, but you get what you pay for, and if  you want to impress, this is one of the best places to do so in Kensington."
December 2017,Excellent ,"I’ve stayed in some amazing hotels around the world, but none that has the staff and level of service that this hotel has...everyone went above and beyond to make this a comfortable and welcoming experience for my husband and I, who were travelling with our 3year old..excellent "
December 2017,TRULY WONDERFUL,"Excellent in every sense with the most professional service from staff who were a joy to meet.World class from check-in to check-out.  The Milestone offers the welcome, comfort and style of a lovely country house with it's fabulous interior and a situation overlooking Kensington Gardens. An oasis of luxuriant cosy peace in the heart of London.  Our bedroom and bathroom were perfect with no detail overlooked. Dining options range from a fantastic formal menu to light snacks and even a midnight feast.  The staff make this hotel what it is and were unobtrusively on hand to assist in every way . They even mentioned a stay that my late mother had there several years ago - which was very touching."
November 2017,Special Place,"The service here is just amazing. The hotel has so much character. After 1 day all the people that worked there knew my name and when I went back on a second trip, they remembered me. The breakfast is one of the best meals I had while in London"
February 2018,Valentines day,After travelling such amount of places... you find super quality hotel from London... We practically live in hotels for the past 3 years... and This place just went straight to the Top 3 We ever visited!! Amazing room.. incredible service and staff!! Highly recommend to visit! We will return for sure
December 2017,A wonderful place to stay.,"If you're looking for somewhere with great service, beautiful rooms, a central London location with a spa - as well as a touch of old fashioned England - look no further! This hotel (a long time favourite) delivers on all fronts. And if you're interested in history, you'll have that too.  The Milestone combines beautifully decorated and sumptuously cosy, antique filled rooms with twentieth - century comfort. And then it does more: it thinks of every little thing you may need, or want, just to make your stay better. It's one of the reasons why I go back again and again."
February 2018,Truly Exceptional! Perfect Hospitality!,"We just returned from too brief a stay at The Miletsone. From the moment we stepped out of our taxi, we were greeted with great warmth, genuinely hospitable and warmly polite staff, toured through the gorgeous main floor lounges, pub, and elegant dining room.  We were ready for luxury after 2 weeks of skiing in Italy and touring Amsterdam. Our room was the perfect haven, neutral colors, upholstered walls, complimentary champagne delivered to us while we settled in, and fresh flower accents everywhere throughout the hotel.   The bath was quite clean, and fully outfitted with sparkling fixtures and an abundance of piping hot water and plenty of fluffy towels, and lovely amenities. Our arrival was later than expected, so we chose to dine in the glorious dining room - incredible…"
February 2018,Great hotel,"Stayed at this hotel due to work. Great hotel, great staff, room was clean and cozy. Next time i visit uk i Will guarantee I will stay here. Great service and service minded staff. I’ll come back soon again"
February 2018,The Spa Treatment at The Milestone,"I just had the most amazing facial, Fiona is a master masseuse. It’s been a long time since I left a facial treatment feeling completely rejuvenated. The creams, the oils, the face and neck massage was such an experience like no other. Fiona was just amazing. I walked out of the spa my face looking and feeling like velvet. Thank you Fiona!!"
February 2018,Afternoon tea birthday treat,"Well we had a wonderful afternoon, the staff simply couldn't do enough for you The hotel is just beautiful, and so very English The tea sandwiches , scones and cakes were exquisite and the customer service first class Thankyou for looking after us so well My sister and I had the perfect afternoon  "
February 2018,Superb!,"I have stayed in many luxury hotels, large and small, and I must say that The Milestone is at the top of my list. The hotel is lovely and we'll appointed. Room, dining room, lounge and bar are wonderful. But what sends The Milestone over the top is the above and beyond service!! Everyone knows your name and nothing is too much to ask. My friend the doorman, knowing that I ride my horse, walked me to a lovely equestrian store nearby. We come to London every February and this will be our go to home!"
February 2018,"Most attentive and friendly staff, great experience",Located a short walk from Kensington Palace and the Royal Albert Hall this amazing quality hotel has the best staff we have ever experienced - their attention to detail and service was second to none. Even to the point of putting a velcro strip around our Iphone charger cable!  Unexpected treats for my birthday to! Magnificent... We will be back! .
March 2017,Relatively unimpressed ,Booked this as a weekend away with friends quite a while ago but only just got round to reviewing it.  Upon arrival our rooms were not ready which was slightly inconvenient but they gave us a free drink.  The worst thing was when we went down for breakfast the next morning we were told there was no tables but we could eat breakfast In The coffee lounge The tables are so low and totally unsuitable- not impressed 
February 2017,Over priced to keep out the riff raff,Quiet but nevertheless enjoyable near to Hyde Park and Ken High Street for shops and etc. Expect a large bill for what ever services that you have here. Great interior and surprisingly cosy. Parking can be a real nightmare in central London so plan ahead and use public transportation   
December 2017,Very nice and cozy tea,"Went here with a lovely friend and her daughter joined us a bit later. The hotel is nice enough looking and the tea service was as good as tea at The Ritz but half the price and local to where my friend lived. Sandwiches very fresh and the usual salmon, egg salad, cucumber, ham and cheese - tasty cakes and patisseries - oven hot scones with all the delights that go with them. 9/10 and easy to park nearby in a side street!"
January 2018,Afternoon tea,We enjoyed afternoon tea here after having stayed at the hotel before and loving it. It is a quintessential English topnotch establishment. My dream is to win the lottery and move in here someday. Tea is fantastic and not overly fussy. Lots of choices for tea and very accommodating for a party of 4 with one vegetarian. All of the sandwiches and pastries were so beautifully made~we commented that it is a treat to eat food that has been made so artfully. Save room for the warm scones with jam & clotted cream!
December 2017,Old World Charm,"First time at Milestone but not the last. Old school hotel with lots of charm and a top shelf, extraordinary staff and level of service. (Left jumble of power cords out one day but returned to see staff had neatly wrapped them up with hotel-supplied ties.)   Every room in hotel seems different but are filled with interesting decor. Hotel bar was cozy and food and tea at Milestone were pretty special. Wish more American hotels provided this level of detail and service because my Milestone Hotel experience was a joy."
December 2017,Our London home for our son’s wedding.,"We stayed in two of the apartments for two weeks from before Christmas until after New a year. December 30th, our son was married.  The groom’s 86 year old grandmother, who need a wheelchair outside, was with us.   We could not have found a better place to call home for this two weeks.  The apartments are beautiful, comfortable, and well stocked. The staff was very attentive, but really kind.  We were able to relax and celebrate, but not feel stuffy and too formal. Every request we made (and there were many) was met with a smile and made to seem easy - even when we knew it wasn’t! There were many relatives, friends, and wedding party members staying in the hotel with us. There were too many last minute reservation changes, but again, the staff handled them with grace and ease.…"
June 2017,basic business stay,This is a small room and it is 5 mns from the tube and shops and restaurants. It has a basic breakfast and though the lounge areas are updated the rooms are not. My room was tacky and had a strange sell.
January 2018,British charm and subtle sophistication,"If you want a perfectly elegant and unpretentious stay, The Milestone is for you. Our family of 3 stayed for a week after Christmas and over the New Year. The apartment (#6) was spacious and fully equipped for our long visit. The staff are kind and welcoming and all knew our names after just a day or two. Within a short walk are many great restaurants, although the food at the hotel is wonderful, so there is no need to explore if you choose to stay close to home.   The bartenders are on their game, offering tasty snacks and craft cocktails for those enjoying the warm and cozy rooms by the bar.   We were all made to feel like family. And there were many families there, along with some international business types. Common areas are beautifully appointed and always full of staff…"
January 2018,Mrs,"Best hotel i’ve ever stayed at. Great service, the best restaurant, excellent room service, friendly staff....everything was just perfect. Will from now on always stay here when visiting London. Ritz will never see us again. Special thanks to The Milestone Hotel."
October 2017,Lovely!,"I stayed here when I spent four days in London. The hotel is beautiful and the staff is really nice and attentive. The room service and afternoon tea are great. The hotel is right near Kensington Palace and the Victoria and Albert Museum. The best part about the hotel is the food, especially the Belgian waffles and honey comb icecream. Stay here!"
August 2017,Amazing place and people,"What a wonderful hotel We had looked at other high end hotels in the area and chose the Milestone. Our room was wonderful and so cozy. Each room is unique and ours was a bi-level with great shower, tub and heated towel rack. The bed was super comfortable and they even set up a small bed for our 9 year old daughter. We all had beautiful robes waiting and they even had one for our daughter. Each day there was a nice treat on her bed for her. Great location. Another highlight was the staff. They knew who we were and they set up a special tea and dinner for our children. The bar staff were great and looked after us and got the ""cosmos"" perfected. I wish I could remember their names (two from Italy and one from Germany) We also loved the choice of beer. The one from Namibia was great…"
October 2017,Truly one of the best hotels in the world,"From the minute you arrive at The Milestone Hotel, you feel completely welcomed and happy.  The staff goes above and beyond to make you feel comfortable and well cared for.  This is a professionally run, deluxe hotel that will give you a 5 star experience.  Our room, the services, the staff, and the breakfast - everything was perfectly done.  Every time we entered our beautiful room, we felt like we were in an English country manor house and had been given the best room!  I would also like to add that the hotel had been particularly accommodating to us.  We did not originally book at The Milestone, but at a nearby hotel at which we had a very unpleasant experience.  Not only did The Milestone find us a room immediately but their welcoming atmosphere made us feel completely…"
October 2017,The Ultimate English experience,"When you go to England you want to have an English experience, right? Well, look no farther; this is it. Within minutes of checking in, every staff member knows your name. the room is large and yet cozy. The bar is charming and well stocked. Afternoon tea is classic and wonderful. Smashing!"
September 2017,Amazing aperitivo,My girlfriend and I have been at the stables bar for a pre dinner drink. Lovely atmosphere and wonderful cocktails! Angelo never stops to surprise with his concoctions. The canapes were deliiiiicious!! We will def be back!
October 2017,I love this hotel,"I seriously love this hotel. I was able to stay here one night back in 2011 and I swore to myself I'd be back one day. Well this year I was able to come back for an entire week to celebrate my second anniversary with my husband. We had such a magical week in London and most of that comes from staying in this hotel. The location is fantastic, the room spacious (We got a Deluxe Studio), and the service perfect. Both my husband and I just can't say enough about this place. Everyone's very helpful and accommodating. It's simply the best place to stay in London. Highly recommend."
December 2016,Britain's traditional Hotel by Excellence ,"This is a magical Hotel, my family has been traveling to this hotel for many years.  The topical English place to have the best stay in the British way.  The afternoon tea, the bar , the Restaurtant the typical English scenery. Right in front of the park.   If you want to enjoy a Hotel in London, this is it.    Don't miss the best traditional style.   "
September 2017,Immerse yourself in true British tradition,"This is a 5 star boutique hotel with a long and interesting history since its original construction in the early 1800's. It is utterly British, charming and dedicated to your service. All the public areas were quietly busy throughout the day and evening with people obviously there knowing the Milestone reputation. At the end of our dinner in the restaurant one evening, Prince Harry and Meghan came in for dinner in the private dining room. No surprise- Kennsington Palace, his childhood home across the street, was lovingly decorated by the people for the 20th anniversary of Diana's death- a very moving sight.    The story of the Milestone Hotel was posted in our room and gave us an appreciation for the preservation efforts of the Brits through so many decades. It also explains the…"
October 2017,Excellent service but sense of narrowness haunted us,"I want to agree with all the reviews praising the staff hospitality and professionalism. All our requests met immediate response, we felt care during all our stay. The location is ideal when you are to explore neighborhoods - Kensington, Chelsea, Knightsbridge and probably Mayfair. What really surprised - pretty compressed spaces in lobby, dining hall, other public areas. Tiny superior rooms where queen bed occupies two-thirds (or even more) of room space. Imagine if you are two in this room. Yes, the hotel occupies a historic English country manor style building and such features might be expected. Just be aware of that when making your choice."
October 2017,A layover to remember ,"My husband and I stayed at The Milestone on a layover this week.  I honestly can't say enough good things about the hotel.   From the moment you arrive,  every staff member goes out of their way to treat you like royalty.   When arrived in our room,  we were greeted with champagne,  a thank you card,  cookies and a little souvenir.   Later that night we went to dinner to celebrate my husband's birthday and when we got back to our room,  they had placed a pair of slippers on each side of the bed,  lit a candle in the bathroom by the tub and left us a little treat on the nightstand.   To say they go above and beyond is an understatement!  "
October 2017,Service is amazing,"I loved the Milestone Hotel!  The service, location, room size and amenities were all perfect.  I felt the staff went above and beyond and always addressed me by name, even the second I arrived and stepped out of the taxi, how do they do that??  This is definitely the hotel to choose when you're in London.  The location is perfect too, it's right across the street from Kensington Palace and within walking distance of restaurants and shops."
September 2017,Amazing first experience in London,"We stayed 4 nights and it was simply top notch! We had breakfast included, we had one dinner, afternoon tea and a few occasions to sit in the bar at the hotel and everything from quality of food to service was incredible.  We celebrated our anniversary while there and they went more than the extra mile to make it one of the most memorable. All of the staff were helpful, courteous, and definitely know what customer service means.  Our room was extremely beautiful and comfortable.  Loved the bathroom as well. Loved our entire stay!!"
September 2017,The MOST Amazing boutique hotel. Service superb!,We stayed 2 nights and had breakfast included in our rate - highly recommend.  WE ate at the hotel Restauarant the second night - and food and service (again) were excellent. We were greeted by name from the first minute we arrived until we checked out.  We travel internationally 2X a year and this is one of our favorites ever.  The Bar is intimate and charming and the Bartender/restaurant manager - Fabrizio - whipped up a hot toddy for my husband as he was feeing a bit under the weather.
November 2016,I almost don't want to tell you how wonderful this place is.....,"This is an oasis of serenity, and smoothly run in the centre of a bustling city. Thoughtfully chosen wines to go with beautifully thought out menus. A real treat to come here. The atmosphere and the building itself will appeal to overseas visitors, and UK visitors  alike. I look forward to returning."
September 2017,"The service from the staff was exceptional, always felt safe, comfortable and welcome.","The attention to detail by the staff, the furnishings, concierge, waiters, front desk staff, doormen, room service, suite attendants was equally exceptional. Staff got to know us and engaged with us each time we crossed paths. The location of the hotel in the Kensington area was perfect for our visit to London"
September 2017,My Dream and My Home,"Your hotel, your staff, your service, your room (especially apt #1) was amazing. I asked, Is this real?:) You make me feel so special, so happy. this hotel will be my home in London:) If you really want to feel this feeling, pls stay there. Before I checked out, I scored and gave 10, after that the general manager sent me an email to thank you. This also shows the difference. After I checked out, you still make me special,my opinions are important for you. I am really so grateful and thank you very much for all your interest. I hope I ll come again..."
September 2017,Best hotel in London,"This is a return visit for us.  Positioned conveniently opposite Kensington Palace with its beautiful park and gardens, this is a luxurious hotel.  From the moment you approach the doors, to the beautifully appointed bedrooms, this is an exquisite experience.  The staff are superb, welcoming without this patronising attitude that a lot of high class hotels seem to air.  The public area are superb, relaxing and so comfortable.  The breakfast here is fantastic, beautifully presented, with every choice you could imagine.  I really don’t want to shout too loud about this gorgeous hotel as I may find I cannot book in future!!  I can’t wait to return. Thank you to all at The Milestone "
October 2017,The Royal Treatment,"This place is the most service-oriented hotel I've ever stayed in. We just wrapped up a 5 day stay here and feel a little like we are leaving home. The food in the restaurant is excellent, as is the service (thanks, Jack). All of the staff are friendly and helpful. The bar is great, too. A wonderful change of pace from a chain hotel. Will definitely recommend to friends."
September 2017,Superior Hotel,"We had the pleasure of staying at the Milestone Hotel in Kensington for four nights in September 2017. This is  an exceptionally well situated boutique hotel across from Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. Our bedroom was well furnished and meticulously cared for.  All the staff took great care to remember our names and furnish us with anything we might need to make our stay memorable.  There is a cozy bar, lovely atrium room ideal for afternoon tea, a well appointed dining room for breakfast/dinner. And obviously a very good chef running the kitchen. Highly recommended."
September 2017,Magnificent!,"The Milestone sets the standard for five star elegance and over-the-top hospitality.  Every need is anticipated by the staff.  The bar and restaurant are outstanding and the service is superb.  For the business traveler, the hotel offers peaceful rest in a comfortable setting.  For the vacationer, an elegant, romantic setting.  This is my new destination in London for both!"
May 2017,Our favorite hotel in London,"We travel quite a bit. Every time we stay at the Milestone we feel like we have come home again. Comfort is particularly important when you are traveling long distances or when your stay is long. The Milestone staff is extremely concerned with their guests comfort. The rooms are elegant and comfortable with a uniquely British style. The hotel is small enough that the staff know the guests. The location is excellent, just across the road from Kensington Palace, with easy access to the park and a short walk to Kensington High Street shops, restaurants and tube station.  If your stay is long, or you are traveling with your family consider booking one of the fully serviced flats. Another perk for parents is their very good babysitting service, which we used a lot when our son was…"
August 2017,Wedding night stay,"I stayed here the night before my wedding and the night of our wedding with my wife.   We had been in contact with the hotel on and off over the last 8 months or so discussing our stay and which room to have etc as they are all quite different. They were very helpful although our only disappointment was that we asked for an earlier check in so I could get ready prior to the wedding. They said no which meant we had to book another nights stay to guarantee we could have this. As an exception we thought they would have been a bit more accommodating.   Apart from that everything else went very smoothly. Upon arrival back to our room after the wedding the hotel had been decorated with rose petals, chocolates and a couple of glasses of champagne was waiting for us. What a lovely and…"
August 2017,WOW,"My wife and me celebrated 30 years of marriage. The whole stuff was really friendly and very attentive. On the day of the thirtieth anniversary of our wedding, an exhilarating surprise awaited us in the room - we are not going to forget it. The location is very central - about ten minutes taxi driving to most attractions. You must try the bar - Angelo prepares great cocktails."
August 2017,Best hotel experience EVER!!,"We just returned from a two-week trip to England and Switzerland and our stay at the Milestone was the best hotel experience we have EVER had! They totally spoiled us and set the bar so high that other hotels may not ever be able to top it!   It is a gorgeous classic historic hotel in a beautiful location in Kensington.  There are multiple rooms for relaxing including a library, and a solarium with a soothing fountain.  There is a health spa with a pool and exercise equipment to use although we didn't have enough time to utilize it after all the sightseeing we did.  We arrived from Oxford (where I had fallen and sprained my ankle and was having difficulty walking) and their cheerful doorman greeted us and helped me into the lobby.  The entire staff is always friendly and eager…"
August 2017,Lovely spa day,"Came here for a massage and to use facilities for a few hours. Whilst the spa is very small (small swimming pool, sauna, small relaxing area enough for two ppl then gym, changing rooms and massage room) it was perfect for what we wanted and we were the only ones there. The pool had a jet so that you can swim in one place against the current.  Massage was really lovely and the therapist, Moy (sp?) was so welcoming - we both felt so relaxed after. Would definitely go again if in the area "
July 2017,Wonderful stay,It was our first time in London I am very happy to stay in hotel milestone hospitality is too good laundry service is available in the hotel free WiFi Internet access spa is available in the hotel swimming pool is also ervry thing was great fantabulus thank you for feel me like homely 
July 2017,Stellar Experience ,"My husband and I celebrated my 30th birthday and our 8 year wedding anniversary. We went to London, Paris and Rome. We can truly share with you all that no one made us feel more at home than the wonderful team at The Milestone Hotel!! Our experience was stellar, the staff members truly go beyond the call of duty to make you feel at home. From the minute our driver pulled up to the hotel we were given the royal treatment! We truly can't wait to go back and stay again at The Milestone Hotel! We will see you soon Patricio, Ronald, Fran!! To name a few ❤️"
August 2017,Amazing,"Wow, what a phenomenal place.  A really great property with spectacular staff.  I was made to feel extremely special at every single moment.  Kind of awe inspiring how detailed and genuine their interest was in being invested in me as there guest.  Location is excellent.  Common spaces comfortable, cozy and upscale.  I want to give a special mention to Clea who kept me engaged in conversation while awaiting my cab ride to the airport.  Frank and Jose at concierge for especially arranging everything regarding my tickets to a soccer/football game.  Pranav for a fantastic check-in.  Angelo in the lounge was amazingly friendly.  All these amazingly polished staff were spot on with each guest, not just me.  Room was spotless.  Fruits on special treats at check in and throughout my…"
October 2016,The Best,"stayed in Mistinguett suite Wife organised as a surprise for my birthday. The room was fantastic  Champagne was in room as well as cake.We had drinks in race theme bar,great place for drinks.Went to China town for meal and back to Milestone. The staff were fantastic  through  out stay.Next day had cream tea in the most fantastic room .When you step outside the Milestone it make you feel like a million dollars to know you have stayed in one of the world's best hotels.Exspenive but I am sure my wife would say worth every penny. Thanks to ALL the staff."
June 2017,Top Notch Historic Hotel in London!,"Fabulous stay with FABULOUS service. Ask for the wakeup service.  They come knock on your door with a wonderful tray of fresh coffee to help wake you up.  Incredible staff.  We had afternoon tea which was also a wonderful London experience.  The bar area on the patio is a must see. Also, the cocktail under smoked glass is a must order."
July 2017,PERFECTION,"We stayed at The Milestone for three days, just too short. We received excellent service from all the staff, special mentions go to Sandra, Giacomo and Nik. Nothing was too much trouble. The hotel is superbly situated in Kensington overlooking the park. Breakfast was delicious as was the afternoon tea. We shall indeed be back. It was our Oyster Box in the city."
June 2017,Kristin Elias,The staff at this hotel are amazing!  We were so spoiled by all of them. Didn't want to leave. They truly made us feel like family. Clea was especially kind to my teenage daughters. This was truly a treat!  Will definitely return.
June 2017,Summer Time fun with my kids,"a friends recommended we stay at any Red Carnation Hotel. So we did. What a great experience we had, great breakfast choices and cocktail bar. Would love to go back soon and spend another week. We were helped with tickets and reservations to great neighborhood restaurants."
June 2017,The Milestone - Kensington,"A friend of ours recommended the Milestone Hotel prior to us selecting a hotel for our week in London.  Our friends have great tastes and travel often so when we read all the great reviews and it was an easy decision to stay at The Milestone.  Now that the trip is over, we can honestly say the reviews and recommendation even exceeded our expectations.  When we arrived at The Milestone Hotel in London we were greeted with open arms. Pedro was quick to make sure our luggage was taken care of as he began our private tour of the hotel (lobby, restaurant, Stables bar, our apartment, etc.) and it's amenities. We quickly settled in to our new  beautiful “home” for the next week complete with fresh strawberries & cream and a glass of champagne for my sister and me.   Jose and the…"
June 2017,AN EXCELLENT HOTEL TO STAY FOR VACATION OR ANNIVERSARY,"Our family's stay in The Milestone Hotel in London went beyond our dreams. This was an extraordinary experience for our 40th anniversary! The staff were delightful and catered to all our needs and comfort. The location was in walking distance of our family members and some of them joined us for breakfast. The food, amenities and valet parking was excellent. We will be telling our travel agent of AAA Utah to Highly recommend this unique hotel. We have already informed all our family and friends. Can't wait to visit London and stay there again in the near future."
July 2017,Fabulous afternoon tea,"Myself and two friends visited The Milestone on Saturday 1st July for afternoon tea. We were greeted with such a warm welcome - nothing was too much trouble, the service was faultless and the hotel was beautiful.  There is an endless tea menu and the varying platters of sandwiches, cakes and scones were absolutely delicious! We even had to take some home with us in a box as we weren't quite able to finish it all!  The staff can't do enough for you and there was no feeling of being rushed even though the hotel was busy.  A really lovely afternoon, thank you.  "
July 2017,Miles above the rest!,"My wife and I had to come up with plans for a different kind of London trip as the Adele concert we wanted to attend was suddenly canceled and we had booked our flights way in advance with no cancellation option. Staying at the Wembley Hilton across the venue didn’t make sense anymore so we had to pick a new hotel in central London. Great reviews led us to The Milestone Hotel. A beautiful building in a great location right next to Kensington Gardens. When we arrived a bit before checkin time and the room wasn’t ready we got complementary glasses of champagne and chatted with the especially friendly and attentive staff for a while, then were treated to a short tour highlighting the great history of this place. We had booked a deluxe studio room that - like the rest of the…"
May 2017,"Great staff, ok room, poor location","The staff was wonderful. The bartenders, concierge, front office, and servers were all great.  Above all were the bellmen who spent many minutes flagging down cabs, a problem caused by horrible traffic.   Dinner was excellent.  The breakfast was pretty good, although buffet could have been better.  The room was nice, we looked out on the park.  A serious problem was a steep step to the bathroom.  I have bad legs and it was a problem  Location was bad. On the SW corner of Kensington Park there is nothing near by, except K Palace itself. The tube is 0.4 miles away, so a cab is needed. The traffic is very bad, and the bellmen spent many minutes flagging one down  We would happily return if we got a better room and somehow traffic was better"
June 2017,Most Extraordinary Staff we have EVER EXPERIENCED,"The Milestone is a truly charming, lovely, boutique hotel situated directly across from Kensington Palace. The physical charms of the place could be enough, but the staff and the extra touches are beyond amazing. We were there for only 4 days/nights but felt like we belonged, with everyone greeting us by name, serving us beyond what was expected, and bringing surprises every night including a strawberry birthday cake. The turndown services and high tea, the in room accoutrements, everything was perfect. Plus the dover sole in the restaurant was some of the best I have ever eaten.  Kudos to everyone at the Milestone for contributing to such a wonderful London visit."
July 2017,Don't stay anywhere else,Incredible hotel. True 5 star service. The hotel is in a beautiful area just across from Kensington palace. The food is excellent. We were still on USA time and loved that we were able to have food served in the lounge at midnight. Also have the best mixed drinks in london.Can't say enough about this place. Definitely will be back.
September 2017,Extraordinary!,"This isn't just a hotel, its an experience! From the moment we exited the taxi from the airport we were greeted by name. ""Welcome Mr. and Mrs...""  Whether it was simply stepping off the elevator, entering the restaurant for our amazing breakfast every day, or simply coming back from a long day of exploring magnificent London, the staff welcomed us with a smile and warmth we frankly are not accustomed to in the states.  The service was beyond measure in every instance.  Truly cannot say enough about that.  The room was also warm and inviting, and the bathroom was lovely as well with very cushy towels and higher end toiletries.  (I appreciated the lighted magnifying mirror!). When we returned for the day the room had always been attended to and was spotless, and the turn down…"
September 2017,Practically perfect!,"We visited London for the first time, and stayed at the Milestone.  From the moment we stepped out of our cab, we were embraced by the kind and interested staff at the Milestone.  Frankly, I've never experienced hospitality like this in any hotel!  The staff really are interested in each visitor - ready to listen, help, offer advise, and generally do whatever it takes to make your stay perfect.  Even our chamber maid was charming and loving - full of cheer and concern that we were well cared for.  AND - our room was lovely, the bar was charming, the restaurant delicious (I recommend the Dover Sole...). I couldn't possibly recommend this hotel enough!  It's a little expensive, but totally worth the extra cost."
August 2017,Over-the-top Afternoon Tea!,"This review is solely regarding the amazing Afternoon Tea service at the Milestone Hotel. My husband and I were vacationing for the first time in London.  We wanted to experience an authentic Afternoon Tea.  A local person recommended this hotel's TEA which was elegantly served in a beautifully wood paneled library.  From the concierge to the waite servers, we received a royal welcome!  The food was splendid and all prepared ""in house"".  The service is essentially in 3 parts: sandwiches including a house special of chicken breast coated with crushed almonds, followed by warm scones (best I've ever tasted) served with homemade preserves and butter, and finished with at least 10 mini desserts that were as delicious as they looked!   The price was high but well worth it.  We were…"
August 2017,The perfect hotel!,"This was our second stay at the Milestone, and we loved it every bit as much as the first. The location is perfect, the hotel is beautiful, the rooms luxurious and the breakfasts are among the best we've ever eaten, but what really sets the Milestone apart is the staff. We hadn't been back in London for a few years, but we were welcomed back like family and we were amazed at how many people remembered us. It really was like going home. Everyone was warm, gracious and accommodating, and we were treated like royalty. We wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else in London and promise not to wait so long until our next visit."
March 2017,No other place to stay!,"This is one of those reviews that you almost don't want to send because you want the Milestone to be a well kept secret so you  can have it all to yourself.  What a incredible and wonderful boutique hotel.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else in London.  Location--great, across from Kensington Palace, about a block away from the underground, and wonderful restaurants and things to do in the neighborhood.  Accommodations--outstanding, comfortable, every room unique, clean, tea and biscuits to welcome you.  Breakfasts--anything your heart could want.  Service--I have never had better and I have traveled and stayed all over the world.  The concierges were spectacular.  They could get you anywhere, just show them the map and they could explain every line and where to switch.  Their…"
August 2017,THE ONLY PLACE IN LONDON TO MEET FOR DRINKS,"I have been to the Milestone many times over the years, and visited twice in August, 2017 just to have drinks in the bar room.  Both times served by the impeccable Lukas. Always in his white dinner jacket, so friendly and knowledgable..... make sure you have a drink on the bar room to enjoy some old time surroundings and a staff like no other."
August 2017,Afternoon Tea in style for all the family!!,"Just perfect for experiencing a top quality hotel! my husband, myself and 5 and 7 year old! lovely tea and staff took kids to do cupcake decorating.   The tea was lovely although have possible had better at Fortnums but otherwise highly recommended and the staff make it extra special"
August 2017,Back to the Milestone!,"Back for the 2nd time this year, and perhaps a half a dozen previous visits over the last 5 or 6 years.  A special visit as I became a British citizen on this trip.  Repeating myself, but it feels like going home . . . everyone is always nice, and remembers me, and my family (even when the family isn't there they ask after them).  Love being accross for Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park.  I can count on The Milestone to be a no stress zone during travels."
August 2017,One of the best Afternoon Teas I have had!,"We booked the Milestone Royal afternoon tea for a member of the family's 60th Birthday. It did not disappoint in the slightest. A wonderful array of traditional and exciting sandwiches, followed by freshly baked scones and cakes. The champagne was flowing and the service was exceptional. We took our left overs home as they were too good to leave behind. :) ."
September 2016,Amazing service.,The hotel was very nice really liked the fresh coffee or tea delivered in the am. Breakfast was served and very good. The hotel is older but the rooms were very well kept. But the service I must say went above and beyond. They were very accommodating. They helped us book theater tickets. Very helpfully with restaurants and places to see. The location is a little far from the city center but quite and relaxing. There was an Indian restaurant near by which was very good. High tea was also tasty.
September 2017,"Outstanding accommodations, staff and service","When our AX travel agent recommended this hotel, I pushed back because I had never heard of the hotel. I am really happy that we stayed with her recommendation for our first two nights in London. We were booked in the Viscount Suite with a view of Kensington Palace and Garden.  Every member of the staff goes out of their way to make one's stay as nice as is humanly possible. The full English breakfast is exceptional and it includes a full buffet of a continental breakfast before the hot breakfast. You can step across the street to visit Kensington Palace and grounds.  We highly recommend The Milestone Hotel and will return here for a longer stay next year. "
September 2017,Absolutely amazing,"I have stayed at some of the finest hotels in the world....Said with humility but honesty.  The service at the Milestone is the best I have ever encountered.  Had a beautiful suite.  The restaurant is terrific.   But the service....I truly do not have the words to describe it.  The Milestone makes the Savoy look like a Holiday Inn at best!   Truly my favorite hotel---better than Taj, Aman, Penisula...you name it....Thank you Milestone!"
September 2017,Absolute Perfection,"I don't think we have ever stayed at a nicer hotel and certainly not one with the incredible staff we encountered.  From the doorman who chased the cab around the corner to carry our luggage inside to the bartender who set up an impromptu gin tasting for my wife, every person went out of his or her way to make us welcome and comfortable.  Once the staff discovered it was our anniversary, the bar was raised even higher.  Champagne, chocolates, a private dinner in the small dining room -- all with a smile.  I would not begin to single out any one person as all deserve equal accolades.  We had dinner twice.  Both meals were delicious, accompanied by expert, attentive service.   The room (309 I think) was perfect; cozy and spotless.  Kudos to the entire team.  A terrific experience…"
September 2017,Birthday & Gig Stay,"Just returned from a night away from the kids which makes most hotels feel great, but the Milestone went the extra mile with brilliantly warm and friendly staff.  From the moment we were greeted by the doorman, to the reception team through to everyone we made contact with in the hotel, a smile and greeting has never far away.  Our room (302) was lovely with nice details and extremely comfortable decoration and furnishings.  I had organised a bottle of champagne and other little bits for my wife's birthday, which without any prompting arrived subtly and promptly.  They even asked as reception if we were away for a special occasion, which resulted in yet another little surprise of tiny pastries/cakes and a card in our room.  Another nice touch.  We had dinner very early (1730)…"
September 2017,Eight great days at the Milestone.,"This is a wonderful hotel. The staff is extraordinary and the location is great. I have now stayed in four different rooms here, and I must say each room is very different. The rooms are not large, and you may want to upgrade if you can. Be aware that some rooms have the en suite bathrooms down a flight of stairs. If this is inconvenient for you, I would suggest you tell them this in advance, since the hotel is often fully booked and if you don't mention it until later it may be difficult for them to accommodate you with a different room. But in my experience, they will go the extra mile to make your stay an enjoyable one. It is a great hotel."
September 2017,"Second Visit, Still Extraordinary","This was our second visit to The Milestone and it continues to exceed our expectations. The hotel is beautiful - we received a room upgrade and ended up in the Regency Suite - what a spectacularly gorgeous room! The room itself was beautifully appointed, and the bathroom modern and roomy. The rainwater shower is probably the best shower I've ever experienced! The food is delicious and we also had exemplary service at the bar. The Milestone is one of the best luxury hotels we've stayed in - we look forward to a third visit!"
September 2017,Joan,"I have never experienced this level of service! The staff anticipated every need and went beyond my expectations. The hotel is charming and sophisticated, and the staff is friendly and welcoming. Staying at The Milestone Hotel is an experience not to be missed. "
September 2017,Wonderful Two Nights in London,"Even though our stay was brief we thoroughly loved our time at The Milestone! It is probably a tie what my favorite thing about the hotel was - the staff, or the amazing and delicious Afternoon Tea. As far as service goes, everyone who worked at The Milestone was friendly, helpful, and went out of their way to make our time in London enjoyable. I especially loved chatting with Stephen who was hilarious, while Pedro and the Concierge (whose name I'm angry I can't remember) went out of his way to make recommendations of places for us to eat, and helped draw out easy routes on a map for us. And the Afternoon Tea! It was so delicious! So much food! Also the room was clean and cozy, the bathroom luxurious (great tub and mirror!) and room service delicious. Would love to stay again."
September 2017,"Beautiful hotel, sheer luxury","This is a beautiful boutique hotel, opposite Kensington Gardens. The area is fairly quiet for London, and access to public transport is excellent. My room was stunning, with lovely linens, a really comfortable bed, and a gorgeous bathroom. Breakfast and dinner in the restaurant were excellent. Where this hotel scores over many others of quality is, however, the level of service provided by the amazing staff. Every staff member I met was so helpful - nothing was too much trouble. I know where I'll be staying next time I'm in London!"
September 2017,Best Hotel in London,"I stayed a couple of days ago and I just LOVED the hotel. The staff is so helpfull and I loved the Safari Suite (cosi, you have the real impression of being in Africa!!). Spacious and I loved the patio bar to have a drink.  And the view to the parc was fantastic.  Will definitely come back on my next trips! Harmony"
April 2017,City break,"Clean and comfortable rooms a bit dated but did the job. Fair  walk from shops specially when the weather isn't that great and you have a pram to push all the way. Staff have been great, very polite and helpful. Couldn't comment about the food as we didmt use that facility, although other friends that were staying here with us did and said it was good quality and tasty. Would recommend"
June 2017,The Place to Stay in London,"I should start by telling you that this is my husband's favorite hotel ever. And for me, it ranks right there with Le Sireneuse (pre-husband).   The hotel sits right on the edge of Hyde Park, in front of Kensington Gardens (which are in front of Kensignton Palace, a five minute walk from the hotel). It is in the grandest neighborhood in London. In fact, London't most posh residential street is mere blocks away. But that's less important for a tourist. The important things for us were the fact that we could walk to the fabulous museum district, there was a nearby metro stop, and there are lots of restaurants nearby. London is a huge city--it felt to us, probably because we were not familiar with it--bigger than New York, so having a convenient hotel in the heart of this lovely…"
July 2017,The Magnificent Milestone!,"The signature trait of The Milestone is exemplary service and a gracious staff.  The amenities can be found at other hotels, but you cannot find the qualified wonderful staff that embodies The Milestone. The hotel is located across from Hyde Park and Kensington Palace. It is a short walk to the Royal Albert Hall.  Andrei, one of the concierge staff, through his connections was able to get us great seats to the first night of PROMS on the day of the performance.   You may get beautiful accommodations elsewhere, but the service is matched by none."
July 2017,Highlight of trip was our stay at Milestone,"Did not think it could get better than previous visit last fall but it did! Spent a week and entire staff was like family - world class starting with Jose and his concierge team to creative bar staff to front desk to doorman Steven.  Wonderful servers in restaurant be it for breakfast, high tea or dinner.  Have stayed in big and small hotels around the world from NY to Paris to Bangkok. This is as good as it gets. "
July 2017,"Best Hotel, Best Staff","We recently stayed at the Milestone on our first trip to London.  Having done plenty of research, this quaint, boutique hotel was my choice.  It did not disappoint! Steven, one of the doormen, greeted us and made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived.  We had two rooms, and each was perfectly appointed.  The Stables Bar was a favorite stop, and Afternoon Tea, and the pictures your staff took, gave us memories for a lifetime.  Lastly, the location is absolutely perfect.  The Milestone is directly across from Kensington Palace, giving us the luxury of evening walks in the Gardens and quick access to the Diana Exhibit and Royal Albert Hall.  We loved it so much that we are already talking about a return trip.  This is an exceptional and unique hotel that is full of character!"
July 2017,Impressive Jewel in the best location with exceptional service that feels like home... I gave them a 10 or A+,"This hotel is one of the BEST in the world, just the feeling to walk around is unique. Beautiful property, outstanding service from entire staff, great location, excellent food!. They did such a wonderful job that we felt at home!.  I visited with my family and it is impressive how they took care of every single detail. The hotel is charming with lots of history and upgraded to the highest standards. I travel a lot and have a lot of opportunities to see and visit properties, but this one is totally unique! Charming and it offers an excellent experience to all kind of guests.  Business, leisure, single, families, all..The staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and we had a wonderful stay!..."
July 2017,Excellent Hotel,"We were greeted by our names at the curb when our taxi dropped us off and through our entire six day stay. This was remarkable attention regardless if you are having breakfast , dinner or a refreshment in the lounge. Undoubtedly the best staff we have encountered. The service, meals and amenities are the best. I highly recommend this hotel. The location is excellent, across the street from Kensington Gardens, a beautiful park, close to the tube, and there are good restaurants nearby walking distance. The concierge did an excellent job of dinner reservations and arranging daily activities. This was our first vacation in London and this hotel made the vacation GREAT. We will stay here again."
July 2017,Best hotel I've ever stayed at!,"From the food to the service to the location, this hotel can't be beat. Everyone knew our name, even if we hadn't met them yet!  They learn your likes and cater to them.  Also great fitness area. Friendly and fun."
July 2017,Charming small hotel with exceptionally friendly and competent staff.,"I would have given a higher rating had we not encountered a plumbing issue upon checking into our room.  However, the hotel staff was quick to address the problem and moved us to another room for our first night so that the problem could be remedied (a part needed to be purchased and installed).  The hotel management was extremely apologetic and sent a bottle of champagne to our temporary room that first evening.  We were moved back into our original room, which we liked very much, the next day.   When my wife and I appeared for dinner in the hotel restaurant (very cozy and romantic) that evening, we were told that the dinner was on them.  Very considerate and thoughtful.  The hotel is located at the southwest corner of Hyde Park in a very posh part of town.  With Kensington…"
July 2017,'Mini Moon' Location,"We stayed for a couple of days following our wedding at this Hotel is exceptional. We were made to feel at home as soon as we arrived and checked in. The staff are very professional and can't do enough for you. We'd booked afternoon tea on the afternoon of our arrival and it was superb. I have a wheat intolerance and it was catered for, without fuss and my food looked exactly the same as the wheat option so I wasn't made to feel different. The bar areas are a lovely place to relax and the our room was beautiful. We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back."
July 2017,Exceptional - I highly recommend it and I will return.,I stayed in a deluxe  King room with a view of Hyde Park.  It was a great location - lots of green open space and a nice area of London near Harrod's.  I loved the decor - fully renovated but if you like modern decor this is not for you.  Cleanliness 10/10 and does not smell musty- quite an achievement in a building so old.  Accolades to the Housekeeping department.  Service exceptional and memorable.  Staff were polite and warm without being intrusive - they make it look easy but I am sure it isn't and I appreciate the effort involved.  I  felt warmly welcomed throughout my stay.  Almost every staff member remembered to address me using my name.  Every request I made was promptly attended.  Thank you!   The service was much better than at the Rosewood and the Baglioni. This is…
July 2017,Honeymoon,"We stayed at the Milestone for the first two nights of our honeymoon in the U.K. The staff was nice, friendly, and thoughtful. When they learned it was our honeymoon, they dressed our room while we were out to dinner and we came home to rose petals, candles, chocolate, and smooth music on. It was so sweet and thoughtful and we were touched that they went above and beyond to make our honeymoon that much more lovely. We fell in love with London and the Milestone during our trip."
June 2017,Afternoon Tea was our kids highlight of a month in London,Took our 4 kids to London for a month in the summer of 2017... we did EVERYTHING and you know what they remember most? Afternoon Tea at the Milestone Hotel.  If you have young kids (ours are ages 4-10) this is a MUST DO on your next trip to London. The staff was outstanding and treated our kids like royalty (I promise you they are not). We will definitely return next time we're in town.
July 2017,Special hotel,"Just returned from 2 nights at this hotel.  It is an exceptional hotel with wonderful service.  Many small details are included that truly make you feel special:  you are greeted by name each time you enter and leave the hotel, sit in the bar, call reception and room service, etc.  Each day small treats appeared in our room-cookies, fruit, etc.  You are made to feel pampered and the staff can not do enough to make you feel welcomed.  They are attentive without being overbearing. The rooms are clean and beds are comfortable.  Housekeeping is quick to respond to any needs (i.e.. an iron, extra pillows, etc) And of course Kensington is a wonderful area to be in when visiting London-easy transport to everything you need and want to see when visiting.  Also, just strolling through…"
January 2017,Execellent hotel,Wow this hotels is beautiful over looking Kensington gardrens service is excellent i would recommend this hotel nothing was too much touble breakfast was amazing my room had everything you could need or want and evan more thanks to all the staff i will be coming back   
July 2017,Kensington five star hotel with very personalised service,"We loved it here. The hotel overlooks Kensington Gardens and we could see Kinsington Palace from our room. We were given a delightful traditionally furnished deluxe twin room but asked to change as a child in the room above was clearly practising for a tap dance exam. We were given a complimentary upgrade to the Safari suite on the top floor, decked out as if you were glamping in Africa! Masses of towels and Penhaligons toiletries. Rooms perfectly clean. Triple glazed, tea and coffee making kit with fresh milk supplied and kept in the room's bar fridge. Superb breakfasts and dinner in mahogany panelled dining room.  All the staff - reception, concierge, waiters and room maids were utterly charming and couldn't do enough for us. We heard "" absolutely"", "" straight away"", "" of…"
August 2016,Wonderful!,"This is our favorite hotel in London! We have stayed there many times when we have been lucky enough to visit this city. The staff is terrific, the location accross from Kensington Palace is great for a morning walk in the park, the rooms are all unique and beautiful - nothing can compare! Can't wait to return again..."
June 2017,Amazing service and room!,"I loved this hotel location, close to the undergound and many restaurants around.It is in Kensington right by the Kinsington Palace.  The minute we arrived to when we left the service and hospitality was great!  I had a room that over looked the park and it was a great view. I had a deluxe room and it was spacious and had a large bathroom with a tub/shower combo. We also had afternoon tea here and the afternoon teas was great.. the sandwiches were good and the scones awesome. The server at tea was vary knowledgeable with her teas and helped me pick out a great black tea.. even my non tea drinker boyfriend got into it and ordered his own mango tea to try out.  I did not get a chance to eat breakfast as we were out and about every day so early (or me anyways) that i didn't have…"
July 2017,Stunning hotel,"If this isn't the best hotel in London then the best must be very special, attention to detail is second to Noe, staff unbelievably attentive. Our room was fabulous with a small terrace, complementary champagne on arrival and nothing was to much trouble. Breakfast fabulous with a stunning carrot, ginger and orange smoothies the finishing touch, will be back"
June 2017,Very special hotel,"Recently stayed at the Milestone and we could not have been happier.  The staff was incredible - from the front desk, concierge, wait staff, or doorman, each was personable, genuinely interested in our comfort, extremely helpful and took the time with us to ensure our stay was more than pleasant.  Can't imagine a nicer place to stay.  We loved the location and appreciated the view and easy access to Kensington Park.  "
June 2017,Why would you stay anywhere else?,"The Milestone Hotel is my go to place in London.  It's an easy drive to and from Heathrow.  But, the hotel after 6-7 stays the last 3 years has never disappointed and always delighted.  The staff is excellent.  They make you feel so at home.  They are top notch and always want to serve.  It's my experience that at 5-star hotels that I often feel as if a hand is out all the time for a tip -- and here when you tip I felt so appreciated and never expected.  The rooms are excellent old english style with amazing amenities.  The food is just outstanding.  Simple.  Clean. Fresh.  Amazing.  The bar area is wonderful with the black and white garden room.  I stayed for the first time on a vacation with my family and the hotel did everything possible to make it an absolute delight.  From…"
June 2017,Amazing ,Booked The Milestone as a birthday treat and was not disappointed! The room was beautiful and the way we were treated was fantastic. Special mention to Peggy who was really lovely...we will definitely be back!
June 2017,British Excellence,"One of the most gorgeous and unique boutique hotels in the world. Each of the rooms are different and very unique. The bar is wonderful. Tea service is lovely (they even have a special tea for younger guests). You don't have to be staying at the hotel to come for tea or stop in for drinks, so I'd recommend stopping by even if you don't stay here. "
May 2017,Impeccable Service,"This very British establishment features first rate hospitality and  a lovely ambience. The lobby and rooms are a bit small and the restaurant overpriced, but the staff, decor and location are superb and we would not hesitate to recommend this hotel."
June 2017,Wonderful,"My wife, two young daughters and our miniature dachshund have just stayed here for three nights and we couldn't recommend it more.  We were made to feel at home by every single member of staff - all so welcoming, friendly, helpful and professional.  The hotel is beautifully maintained, with attention to detail everywhere, from the decor in the rooms, to the food, to the staff - nothing is too much trouble.  There were so many small touches which we were surprised with that our little girls will remember their stay here forever (paricular thanks to Peggy!). It is wonderfully situated by Kensington Gardens and is also a perfect five star hotel for pets. I am really struggling to think of any negatives, for once.  It is not cheap, but then this is a true five star hotel right in…"
June 2017,5 star accommodation with 100 star hospitality!,"I stayed for two nights as a guest with some friends who stayed longer. What can I say? A fantastic hotel which seemed to cater to any need, want or whim. From Giacomo and Angelo in the bar to Stephen on the door, everyone on the staff was friendly and approachable and all gave us excellent recommendations for activities and eateries. Lilli served us afternoon tea on my arrival and her attentiveness and friendliness was unsurpassed. What a little gem.  Although I didn't use it (this time) the hotel has a fantastic dog friendly policy. As a dog owner myself this is a real bonus in the city. I should add we didn't see or hear another dog all weekend which to me means this hotel offers a discrete service. If you don't like dogs you needn't worry."
June 2017,Spectacular in every way!,"The Milestone is incomparable! The attention to every detail is exquisite, from Jose who arranged transfers and tickets for day trips and fabulous dinner reservations, to Steven who is delightful to talk with each and every time you go out the door, to the fabulous spa. Afternoon Tea is fantastic, as is the morning breakfast. This is a true gem in London! We would definitely stay again, in fact will look forward to doing so!  It is worth it in every aspect!! The area in Kensington is perfect, just across from Kensington Palace and Gardens. Perfect location for walking, dining, strolling the park, and shopping. I can easily see why it wins best hotel in London! It absolutely should!!!"
June 2017,The location is perfect. You can walk across the street to Kensington Gardens.,The staff was superb. Every interaction left us with a smile. Our room was upgraded to a beautiful suite with fresh fruit on our arrival. The location is within walking distance to Kensington Palace and Victoria and Albert Museum.
June 2017,Dreams Do Come True,"This establishment is superior the quality customercare is amazing! I was so looking forward to returning to this hotel and it certainly did not disappoint! It truly is a special haven in busy London. If I could give more stars I would! Thank you once again to the management and staff at this hotel for making us feel welcome guests. It's nice to see that Pedro is still welcoming guests and I have to thank another staff member also I think Kharli- he bought us our room service. But each staff member I have encountered are gracious and the meals served in the dining room are delicious. Till we make another journey to London we will be back to make more memories, until then I shall have to savour the memories of our recent stay. The view over Kensington gardens is beautiful and…"
May 2017,Lovely oasis in Kensington,"We received a lovely welcome as the doorman valet-parked our car for us. Check in was smooth and quick and the delightful staff in this hotel all seemed to know our name straight away. We were given a tour of the hotel and then escorted to our room where a welcome glass of champagne was offered. The room was lovely with plenty of magazines, complimentary bottled water as well as all the usual amenities. A complimentary newspaper and other gifts arrived during our one-night stay. We had lunch in their restaurant ( Chenestons-see my seperate review) before visiting the nearby Science Museum in the afternoon. Other museums are also nearby as is the Royal Albert Hall where we went to a concert in the evening. Kensington gardens and palace are just over the road from the hotel. The…"
May 2017,Amazing Experience,"Wow wow wow. What can I even say about the Milestone Hotel. This was by far the best hotel experience we have ever had. Upon check-in, they gave us a tour of the hotel for about 20 mins, telling us about all of the history which was very cool in itself. Our room was smaller but very nice and it has premium everything. The elevators, stairs, every common area, super nice. They also give all guest any free drink upon check-in which is also cool. This hotel is also right off of the Underground which is easy too.  The dedicated 24 hour concierge here is amazing too, there are a few staff that do this job and all are excellent at recommending things. They can also book things for you at a discount and avoid the lines which is also amazing. They booked us tickets to a show and tickets…"
June 2017,Amazing Small Hotel in London,"The Milestone is probably one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in and we have stayed in a lot of great hotels.  This is a beautifully restored old hotel overlooking Hyde Park with exquisite details in room decor, linens, toiletries and other amenities.  Food is top notch and the bar is classic London pub with a great bartender.  To match the great facility is the amazing staff and incredible customer service.  We arrived by taxi from our flight from Nice France and the doorman greeted us by name, whisked us into the hotel and said I am so sorry but there is someone checking in at the moment so let's go to the bar and I will buy you a drink.  He told the bartender to get us anything we wanted while we waited.  We were served by a great bartender and three times while we…"
May 2017,Perfection,"Just a few days ago, my mother and I returned to the US after a wonderful 3-week trip in Europe.  The Milestone Hotel was a definite highlight of our entire trip.  The property is simply beautiful.  It provided us with the ""old world"" decor and experience we'd hoped for.  During our five-night stay, we had the opportunity to stay in two lovely rooms, each with unique and sumptuous decor.  We felt so pampered by the little touches, including the welcome drink, luxurious soaps, complimentary water, cute slippers, surprise champagne, candles in the bath tub, treats on our pillows, special gifts brought to our room, etc, etc.  The rooms were spotless (the remote control was even sanitized!), the beds very comfortable, and the décor was gorgeous and inviting.  The antique…"
May 2017,Great hotel with incredible service,"The Hotel itself is decorated impeccably for the location and the time period of the hotel. The fresh flowers that are placed in your room daily to the slippers being set up at the side of your bed at turndown service make the quality of the housekeeping above par. They not only turned down the bed and set out the slippers, they left candies as well as turned on the television to a romantic music channel and had candles lit throughout the room. When you wake up you can go down to the restaurant and have a full English breakfast that was probably the best meal we had while we were in London. I know that is not saying much since London is not known for their cuisine, but everything we had was excellent. Fresh orange, grapefruit or pineapple juice accompanied the perfectly cooked…"
June 2017,Paradise found,"The traffic from the airport was horrible and the day was very warm and humid.  London cabs are not air conditioned, so by the time we pulled up in front of the hotel, we were not in the best of moods, however the moment we stepped out of the cab, were greeted by an immaculately dressed doorman escorted up the stairs and into the lobby our moods were changed from flat to almost giddy.  We felt transported into the ideal England, cool and crisp with every visual clue saying that everything was going to be just fine.  The staff was friendly without too much sugar added.  We were given a short tour of the ground floor; sitting room, dining spaces and hallways filled with non-pretentious art and then shown up to our room (303), a very pretty two level affair with the bathroom tucked…"
June 2017,The Milestone London,"This hotel was perfect for our vacation.  Great location, wonderful rooms, and best of all the staff.  From check in to departure the staff handled our every need.  I will stay there again the next time I am in London."
May 2017,The Stables Bar,"Recommended by a friend as a great place for really good cocktails, we were not at all disappointed! A quiet bar tucked back into a gorgeous hotel with a fun ambience and amazing service and bites. The Old Fashioned came out in a clear dome with smoke giving the cocktail a very unique twist on a old classic. The champagne cocktails were fantastic. Looking forward to coming back again someday soon!"
June 2017,Treated like royalty ,"I brought my 13 yr old daughter to London for the first time. We spent 8 luxurious days at the Milestone. It is a beautiful hotel in lovely Kensington. The staff is what makes this place so special. They are knowledgeable, helpful and thought of our every need and surprised us with many treats before we could request them. We cannot say enough about this crew. Tim and Andreas (concierge team) took such great care of us, as well as the bar team, wait staff, doormen and housekeeping. It is obvious that they all love their work and their clients. Thank you for an amazing home away from home! xo Sandy and Grace"
May 2017,Best Hotel I've ever stayed at.  ,"Had an amazing stay here in May. The staff were top notch in their dedication to service.  The bar was small but very comfortable.  Order an old fashioned, it's bare far the best presentation I've ever seen.  "
May 2017,Five Star Perfection!,"One cannot do better than to spend your stay in London at The Milestone Hotel.  The Milestone is a true five star hotel with a staff who are willing to always go above and beyond any expectation to make you feel like a treasured house guest. The Milestone's philosophy is simple and effective - they are the best because they absolutely put the customer first!.  During this trip, we we negatively impacted by the British Airways global IT outage.  The staff at the Milestone did everything in their power to ensure that we were able to rearrange our schedule so that we would not miss any of our planned activities despite losing some vacation time due to the BA debacle.  We would not think of staying anywhere else in London because the Milestone has continuously earned our loyalty and…"
June 2017,"AN OTHER WORDLY  OASIS,THIS IS   BEST HOTEL SERVICE IN THE WORLD","I have been staying  and visiting this hotel for 25 years  and it is only when you stay at this place do you realise how rude and cold staff  are anywhere and everywhere else..The warmth and sweetness and attentiveness of the staff cannot be overstated whoever picks these characters is the best personal manager on the planet ,because the staff has changed over the years ,but the type of personality hired  has remained  .The food is by far the absolute finest quality and value for money in England, you simply cannot find better ,The personal touches and beautiful presentation and service is enough to make you weep with appreciation .It is NEVER  snooty ,pretentious or oppressively trendy .It's a wonderful old fashioned hotel with an intimate atmosphere that is the very definition…"
May 2017,Sublime eloquent hotel,"As usual we researched TripAdvisor and selected The Milestone Hotel and our expectations were far exceeded. In every way, room, food, decor, location and service the hotel was so comforting that it became our friendly relaxing home. We shall return."
May 2017,Exceptional,I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights. This is definitely an exceptional hotel. The staff is amazing no other words to describe their hospitality.  Outstanding room. Indulging bathroom and amenities. Location is beautiful nearby Kensington Palace and Kensington Park.  Definitely I'll come again
May 2017,Recent stay at The Milestone ,"Our stay at The Milestone Hotel was amazing.  You simply won't find a more dedicated, helpful staff anywhere.  I highly recommend this hotel. We will definitely return next time we stop in London and will look for other Red Carnation hotels in the future"
May 2017,"Best Hotel Experience in London in a long, long time","We just finished a week long stay at the Milestone Hotel in Kensington.  We had originally booked another hotel and there were complications with our room.  They referred us to the Milestone.  From the moment we arrived we were treated as special guests.  They found us a large, well appointed room overlooking Kensington Park. The public rooms were a very comfortable venue.  The entire staff is exceptional and went the extra mile to see that nothing was missing for our comfort during our stay.No task was too small, no want of ours went unanswered.  I would stay there again without hesitation and definitely recommend it highly.  The Kourts Los Angeles, CA."
April 2017,Outstanding Hotel,I stayed in this hotel for one night upon my arrival in London.  The staff is amazing and the hotel will spoil you.  My room was tiny but the bathroom was fantastic.  Tea is wonderful.  This is definitely a 5 star hotel.
May 2017,Outstanding hotel,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this beautiful hotel. Located across from the park and close to everything, this hotel showcases the best of England. Beautiful surroundings, very thoughtfully appointed and with incredibly helpful staff. We can't wait to come back and visit. "
May 2017,Prepare to be spoiled rotten!,"Have you ever been spoiled, I mean really spoiled, beyond your wildest dreams? I have, because my husband and I stayed for a night at The Milestone Hotel.  nothing during our stay was too much trouble, the staff were all extreamly pleasant and very helpful.  It felt as though if you so much as sneezed there would be someone handing you a tissue! It felt slightly strange to be given so much special attention as my husband and I are just ordinary family people, but for for one night it felt like a glimpse into how the 'other half' live.  There was lots of added extras, complimentary drink on arrival, lots of quality toiletries and £50 allowance for food in the hotel. These so much thought been put into making your stay as comfortable as possible that we were left wanting for…"
April 2017,Passing through on the way to Barcelona ,"Prepared to be spoiled! From the staff, to the rooms and the amenities the quality of our stay was 5 star all the way. The moment we walked in the door we were treated like special guests with a tour of the hotel and little treats in our room. The staff is so enjoyable and always ready to assist, it would be easy to never leave the hotel. We only had 3 nights at the Milestone, but would not hesitate to stay there again. Wish we had been able to enjoy the afternoon tea. It looked amazing! Next time. Don't miss the bar or the restaurant either!"
May 2017,Why Stay Anywhere Else?,"""No request too large, no detail too small"" is the service philosophy of Milestone, and do they ever deliver!  From the minute that you walk in the door, you are treated as if you are the most important person at the hotel. Every single staff member is customer service oriented and very, very friendly. Our room exceeded our expectations!  The attention to detail in the room from complimentary water to evening turndown is amazing. If you have a request, it is taken care of immediately, and sometimes even if you don't ask. Yes, they are that good!  The beds are wonderfully comfortable and you can choose the perfect pillow for a great night's sleep. Milestone is located in less congested Kensington across from the palace. Tube, taxi or bus are all close by for easy access to any…"
March 2017,Creme de la Creme of English Hospitality,"It is hard to come up with words to describe this beautiful luxury hotel.  The Milestone is truly a five star hotel.  Yes, we have read Tripadvisor's reviews and even so did not expect the level of services and hospitality we received once we're there.  It was our first time in London and the Milestone will bring us back to London several times more.    The Milestone is a small boutique hotel and you'd not notice its charm and understated luxury until you're greeted at the front door, led into the lobby with the doorman enthusiastically telling you what he knows about London.  There're not only  managers at the reception desk but concierge and clerk helping you with your stay.  Another word, the hotel is very well staffed.  And the manager will personally take you to your room…"
May 2017,Simply the best ,"This is some experience! Do you know those rare places where you enter and immediately think: 'this is going to be really good?' This is the ultimate one. The hotel oozes class, tradition, service and friendliness. People are proud of their work and prove they're really very good at it. The breakfast buffet is amazing, all 44 rooms are unique and have a great ambiance. Room service is of the highest quality I've ever seen (believe me I have experienced quite a few). My wife raved about the fresh flowers in the room..  The only little flaws I noticed were the water pressure in our shower and the kind door waiters who were unfortunately a wee bit slow (it got quite amusing testing their friendly languidness however). Nothing to be concerned about, they'll also get that perfectly…"
April 2017,You must stay here!,"If you are browsing on TripAdvisor for a hotel in London, you can stop right now!  You will never find a more elegant, beautiful, friendly, charming hotel.  When we arrived, we were greeted in the most warm fashion.  We heard the 2 best lines one could wish for.  Although it was only 11 am, we were told ""your room is ready and we have upgraded you to a suite""!!!!  As we were tired from the long overnight flight from the USA this was just the best news.  I can only tell you that this set the tone for our stay at the Milestone!!  From beginning to end, they treated us the way you wish every hotel could and would.  There always seemed to be someone there to look after you the moment you needed them, yet no hovering around you either  Room was beautiful, Hotel was gorgeous, food…"
April 2017,"""A Milestone Experience you have to do""","This was our first trip to London and Milestone Hotel did not disappoint. The staff, elegant atmosphere and the service was 5 star. The staff was incredible and knew your name after the first hour you were there. The rooms were beautiful and each one unique with turn down service and a little special treat left each night. Stephen the doorman was delightful, funny and so helpful with everything you needed. It was such a delight to see him each day. The morning breakfast and dinners were excellent. Food was first class. Thank you Milestone for wanting us come back to London next year for s longer stay.   We could of not been more impressed Mr and Mrs White"
April 2017,Love This Place!,"A fantastic hotel with superior service, full of luxury and comfort. Elegant conservatory is the perfect Afternoon Tea destination. I cannot wait to return as it is one of the best hotels that I have ever had tea and drinks in."
May 2016,Beautiful and Clean..,Highly recommend..  The staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was very nice and clean..  Very historic.. Our room had a lovely view...  And places around to walk to.. In a safe area and some Pub's and food..
April 2017,Nice hotel,This hotel has the best rooms. Nicely decorated place. This is one of niceist hotels we visited. Service nixe and polite. Prices are moderate and we will recommande this place. I was  so happy and l 'll come back again.
April 2017,Amazing April Vacation,"We had an amazing stay at the Milestone last week.  We stayed in the Kensington Garden Suite, a lovely split level room.  Our daughters, ages 7 and 10 loved the room.  The service is incredible.  Jose, head concierge, was an incredible resource for the trip planning before we arrived, and of course during the stay (it is impressive when they anticipate what you need before you ask).  From the moment the driver picked us up at the airport we were made to feel special.  Everyone knows your name (yes being from Boston that may sound cliche but it was nice).  We stayed six nights which included Easter.  The Hotel arranged an easter egg hunt for all the kids staying there.  A nice touch.   We thoroughly enjoyed an afternoon tea on Easter.  Breakfast was excellent every morning with…"
March 2017,Red Carnation Collection experience Part 2,"Continuing my Red Carnation Collection Hotel tour: after checking out of the Egerton Hotel I arrived directly at The Milestone, the No2 ranking Hotel of TripAdvisor. It is a much bigger hotel comparing to their sister hotel but the service is just as good, if not better. Directly next to the Hyde Park and Royal Albert Hall, the location is unbeatable. My room was spacious, the bed was confortable and the washroom was very clean. Again like the Egerton Hotel, I had the wonderful surprise romantic turndown in the evening and of course the chocolate covered strawberries! I love their cosy Stables bar and the very stylish black and white Conservatory: Milestone Old Fashioned (cocktail) is a must try. Again the breakfast is cooked as it should, very correct. You can even choose a…"
April 2017,wonderful hotel all around!!,"Fantastic service, good location, amazing breakfast, great specials!  Very comfortable and responsive, enjoyed a late night meal in the cozy bar with Leon, the attentive bartender:), they all go out of their way to be helpful...manager was very amenable...comfortable and worth five stars!"
April 2017,Great place,"This hotel is one of the Great places I've ever stayed in ! The rooms are luxurious and comfortable. The staff goes out of its way to help. The location is perfect. There are not enough adjectives to adequately describe my experience, Can't wait to go back!"
April 2017,Visiting with 6 and 7 year olds over Easter,"WOW! From start to finish! We had heard that the accommodations were top-notch, and that was true. I did not take pictures of our suite as the photos on the site and on Trip Advisor did the room justice.  What pleased me most was the attention and respect that was shown to our kids. From the moment we walked in, they were greeted the same way we were. They were given cute cars to play with as well as some chocolate laid out for the Easter holiday.  We were visiting in order to see ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"" (which was AMAZING!) and the boys dressed up in Hogwarts robes, wands, and house accessories. When we entered the lobby, the staff fawned all over them! They even took pictures. When we returned to our room, the pictures had been printed, FRAMED, and left for us to…"
April 2017,Trip of a lifetime!,"We stayed at The Milestone Hotel for one week while we were in London. Everything about the hotel exceeded our expectations! The entire staff was friendly, accommodating and personable - especially the concierge, Andrea and the doorman, Steven. They helped us find the best restaurants, sights, bus routes and everything in between to help make our trip to London easy and unforgettable.   I would recommend The Milestone to anyone looking to stay in London!"
April 2017,Vacation and London tour,"A terrific hotel to stay. It was centrally located right across from Kensington Palace. The hotel decor was fantastic, the hotel staff proffesional, courteous and friendly. The room we had for our 5 day visit was very comfortable and well laid out. The restaurant and bar were excellent with terrific food and service. My wife and I travel quite a lot and I have not stayed in such a terrific hotel. We have been spoiled and will likely never be lucky enough to stay in such a great hotel again. I would highly recommend the Milestone Hotel to anyone. Great job done by all the hotel staff."
February 2017,passionate people,stayed here for my birthday earlier this year and was made to feel very special. great hotel. lovely spa. food great and lovely people. only gripe would be the parking situation. definately will return
May 2017,25th Anniversary at the Milestone Hotel,"We celebrated our 25th Anniversary at the Milestone Hotel.  Our four days there were perfection.  The staff went all out to make our celebration special.  It is a small hotel so once you check in they know your name and are very good at anticipating your needs.  We ate in their wonderful restaurant the first evening and when we returned to the room they had decorated it with 25th anniversary candles, chocolates, etc.  A very unexpected and nice touch.    Throughout the stay the staff was helpful with tickets, restaurant reservations, getting cabs, directions, laundry and everything that makes being on the road easier.  The room was beautiful with a small balcony and the location just across the street from Kensington Palace was perfect.  Highly recommended!"
February 2017,Safe luxurious pampered stay,"This is the second time we have had Mother Daughter visit to London and been so comfortable staying here with my pre-teen and teenage daughters. We feel like we are staying in a lovely home. And all of the staff goes out of their way to make us happy. From the super yummy breakfast served in the lovely restaurant eatting with silver spoons, to the advice to get around to our slighly odd requests for things daughters have seen on youtubers channels... to white table cloth but feels like a special home dinner (we loved the chicken pot pie and tried the reciepe at home after) and best afternoon tea is at the Milestone. Oh - and a live pianist one evening. Fresh flowers everywhere.Our room was a vision.  Walk out the door and are in Kensington Gardens / Palace entrance wonderful…"
February 2017,Delightful!,"What a treat! Such a friendly and helpful team who make you feel completely at home. Excellent cocktail bar with an extensive list of cocktails. The rooms are amazing, we were upgraded on the day which was a real treat as it was our wedding anniversary! We will 100% be returning!"
May 2017,Superb service and true luxury,"I took my son to stay at the Milestone hotel as we had tickets to an event at the Royal Albert Hall that night. The staff were wonderfully attentive and made our stay so special. Nothing was too much trouble and we felt so pampered. The food was amazing, breakfast and dinner just superb and the decor was so sumptuous and yet relaxed. We had a quick dip in the plunge pool before breakfast, which was a bonus. Cannot recommend it highly enough. "
May 2017,The Staff make the Milestone an incredible experience,"We thought the Milestone was one of the most beautiful hotels we have ever stayed in.  My wife thought the ""attention-to-detail"" of ever aspect was incredible.  However, I thought what made the Milestone such a wonderful experience was the staff.  From our greetting on arrival with Nik, to Andrea the Concierge, Clea, who graciously took us on a  tour of  three suites, Andras our improvised bartender and Steve and Manny at the entrance. Thank you to all!  Mrs. Tollman should be very proud of you as well as the entire staff."
May 2017,Delightful Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon Tea at the Milestone was the perfect choice for a bank holiday indulgence. We felt extremely welcomed, from the initial greeting by our doorman to the attentive nature of all involved in waiting on us. The service was warm and gracious, accompanied by delicious finger sandwiches, (delightful walnut bread), freshly baked scones, (including a chocolate inspired one), and a lovely selection of pastries, we particularly enjoyed those.. The room is rather cosy, an intimate atmosphere which takes you back in time where opulence was the order of the day way back when.   The three of us would eagerly repeat the experience again in a heartbeat! Do go, you'll have the best time!"
May 2017,Absolutely Perfect!,"My wife and I had the very best of times and would highly recommend the Milestone.  The staff led y Leo and Peggy with her shopping advice, Malcolm on the piano and Andrea and Jose helping with travel were warm and wonderful.  I would come back again and love the surroundings.  This is a gem set in the best location next to Hyde Park. The hotel is top rate and the breakfast and High Tea are not to be missed.  From Ohio with love."
April 2017,Comfortable and welcoming ,"We just spent a week at this hotel in London.  It was a perfect choice for us.  The hotel is in a perfect spot in Kensington.  You can easily access public transportation or walk to the many, many attractions in London from here.  It is right across the street from Kensington Garden and the palace, and down the street fro the Royal Albert Hall.  There are many shops and restaurants within an easy walk too.  We had the breakfast included in our stay and it was very nice.  All sorts of items on the buffet and you could also order off the menu.  We did not have tea at the restaurant but did see people enjoying it and the food for that looked wonderful.  What really sets this hotel apart from others is the service.  There is not one thing negative to say...the people who work here…"
April 2017,A true 5 star propertt,"From the moment we arrived to our departure we were made to feel like VIP guests. The room was lovely for my partners young daughter and equally for the two of us.Sumptuous decor a Harry Potteresque cupboard room and beautiful bathroom. We sipped champagne while my partners daughter swam in the swimming pool which she loved having all to herself! All the staff behaved impeccably respectful, and informative nothing was too much trouble and they made us feel comfortable even with an 8 year old. The Milestone was very child friendly.We will book again when we go to visit London next time.Thank you very much to the fantastic Milestone team."
April 2017,Barbara ,"An incredible, luxurious stay at the Milestone for 2 nights. Everything exceeded expectations and the whole staff was wonderful. One of the nicest hotel gyms equipped with a sauna and lap pool as well! "
April 2017,just another FIVE STAR review,"Great hotel!! The concierge & hotel staff were incredible! The hotel is In a lovely neighborhood and the facilities are beautiful. Jose, the concierge planned our stay-recommending places to see and restaurants as well as getting us all the necessary tickets and transportation.  This was a trip to show London to our 8 year old granddaughter and she loved the Milestone. "
March 2017,A London Gem,"Everything here was wonderful, as all the other reviewers have said. Personal attention, beautiful, charming, authentic English surroundings. Great location. Concierge always available and so helpful.  Do not miss having a quick meal or a drink in the beautiful bar area. Excellent service, and apparently, where Ralph Lauren gets his design ides!"
December 2016,A Most Wonderful Experience,"In celebration of my wife's birthday, we spent 8 delightful nights over the Christmas--New Year's holiday period. We couldn't be more pleased in our selection. The hotel is ideally located in central London, close to shopping, restaurants, the Royal Albert Hall and local transportation.  This historic hotel combines a level of luxury and a special atmosphere with a  service staff deeply committed to making one's stay truly memorable  Although our room was a bit small, it was beautifully decorated.  We so much enjoyed our stay at the hotel,we booked a return in October.  AJL USA"
April 2017,Best Ever,"Arrived from the US & was ill. Housekeeping & staff prepared room for me so I could check in early. Middle of the night I needed medical help.  They all but drove me to hospital.  Next day - all from management down were concerned & helpful.  Lots of tea & small snacks.  All treated me like family rather than guest.    Good food for hotel food.    ""Do not disturb"" sign was observed where some hotels it just  means they knock rather than just walking through the door like the French.    Room is extremely comfortable.  Hotel should never place bathroom scales in their rooms.  Gaining weight is last thing I want to think about when traveling.    Afternoon tea was Excellent making this the best hotel."
April 2017,Amazing Hotel and Best Service!,"This hotel was such a welcome surprise. The historic ambiance combined with impeccable service made for a one of a kind experience. Location was perfect. Close to everything there is to see. Rooms are nostalgic and inviting. Staff is on hand at a moment's notice should need anything. Leo, Pranav and Lorena were the most gracious hotel managers I have ever encountered. I hope to stay here the next time I visit London. Love this hotel!"
April 2017,Very high expectations - surpassed!,"I wish this review could from the perspective of someone who is used to luxury travel. However, for my wife and me, three nights at the Milestone, from April 10-13, marked a dramatic upgrade from our usual North American Hiltons, Marriotts and Hyatts.   What I can say is that, since this was intended to be such an unprecedented indulgence for us, I did a ton of research on hotels and, by the time I committed to Milestone, I probably had higher expectations than anyone.  These expectations were surpassed. The hotel is so beautiful and cozy. There are tons of options for having a quiet coffee or drink. Even though we stayed during what was supposed to be a busy time, the hotel was incredibly relaxed, and my wife and I often had the various lounges, studies, and even the piano…"
April 2017,"Boutique hotel, Committed staff","Ended up with a bargain room looking at inner court.  Compact but luxury bathroom and deluxe room amenities made it quite pleasant.  Quiet, adjacent to Kennsington Park, easy Tube connections on major lines.  Staff agreeably solicitous, always chipper."
April 2017,London ,My cousin and I stayed at the Milestone for a week and were blown away .  The service was outstanding. The staff was so friendly and personable . The restaurant excellent!! Loved returning at the end of our day. 
February 2017,Great hotel in great location,"My wife and I stayed there four nights on vacation.  Best hotel I've stayed at in London.  Great location at the west end of Hyde Park.  About a three minutes walk to the underground station.  Staff was incredibly attentive and helpful without being overwhelming.  Lovely bar and sitting lounge to relax in.  Absolutely no noise from the street, occasionally heard someone in the hall but overall incredibly quiet.  Breakfasts were very good.  I had paid for breakfast in advance, otherwise it was terribly expensive.  Great choice of television channels.  Shower was good, although at 6'3"" I had to duck a little.  And praise to the heavens there was an American outlet so my wife could use her hair straightener.  Otherwise there could have been an international incident.  If I had to…"
March 2017,Absolutely Superb!,"I've stayed in hotels around the world, and I've never had a better stay.  The staff was so helpful, friendly and attentive, especially Andrea the concierge.  Lovely room, wonderful amenities, perfect service every time.  I'm recommending the Milestone to everyone I know!"
April 2017,Exceeding expectations at every turn!,"I recently stayed at The Milestone with my three children and cannot rave enough about the outstanding service, gorgeous rooms,and exquisite food!  The staff (high praise to Leo, Steve, and Pedro) go out of their way to make you feel at home.  They are genuine and sincere about it and you can feel the pride they take in their jobs.   Our room was gorgeous and very spacious with sweeping views of Hyde park.  The breakfast was one of the best I have ever had, huge selection!   Room service was fast and delicious.   No detail is overlooked, including fabulous soundproofing of the windows, the most comfortable linens, and beautiful decor.  We can't wait to stay with The Milestone again!"
April 2017,Excellent Hotel!!!,"By far, the best hotel experience to this day!! Amazing staff! Everyone at the hotel was super friendly & helpful. Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable. Looking forward to coming back very soon! "
April 2017,Great stay!,"Used an LHW free stay voucher and chosed this boutiqe hotel.   Checkin was smooth and was quickly shown to my room.   Room was very nice and clean and got a gift from the hotel (for being an LHW member).  Hotel is located near Hyde Park, perfect for a morning walk.  A little mistake with a bar bill at checkout was quickly solved."
April 2017,Afternoon Tea,We went to the Milestone Hotel last Saturday the 1st Of April took all the children for Prince and Princess afternoon tea. Experience was a delight! The staff as so attentive and friendly. They make a mean espresso martini!   Us and our friends were outside in the conservatory area and spent the entire afternoon drinking and eating watching the world go by. Would highly recommend! 
April 2017,My favorite hotel,"This luxury boutique hotel has old world class, impeccable service, beautiful and comfortable rooms, views of Kensington Park from my window. They are great at accommodating gluten free, which is important to me as I have celiac disease. And to top it off, the location can't be beat."
March 2017,Absolutely incredible. Highly recommended,"An amazing hotel, the staff went above and beyond to make us feel very welcome. The room was gorgeous and the food was out of this world. I can also highly recommend the cocktails. We will certainly be returning."
March 2017,Fantastic,"What an amazing experience, the staff were great, couldn't do enough for us, the room we stayed in was gorgeous. Everyone was friendly and welcoming, they even left a present for our son in the room. Strongly recommend people to stay there, we will definitely be back, thank you!"
February 2017,Outstanding Hotel Experience,"The Room: Very clean and elegant. Great space with ample closets. Full disclosure - We had the plumber fix our toilet once when it wouldn't stop running. We never got the bathroom outlet to work, but there were plenty other working outlets available so we didn't report it. We stayed 4 nights and were very comfortable.  The Hotel: CHARMING. We loved ending each evening with a nightcap from the stables bar. Plenty of rooms off the lobby to sit in, each with their unique characteristics. We enjoyed a proper afternoon tea - the chef was very accommodating with my food allergies, even though we did not make advance arrangements. The building has a great history. I recommend allowing them to give you the lobby tour upon arrival.   The Staff: Exceeded expectation. Peggy, Fran, Leo, the…"
March 2017,Wonderful staff,"We loved this boutique hotel - everything about it was superb, the staff especially.  We shall definitely be staying here again.   Our only negative comment was the shower head in our deluxe room was positioned such that you had to stand right against the end of the bath in order to stand under the shower."
February 2017,"Great stay, stayed here for 2 nights!what a lovely place to have been. Clean, descent, with character. Great staff ","We had a great stay here. Wonderful hotel, great location, with class . Excellent service, clean and tidy rooms, .fascinating. I hope to be here some time later this year.. a dream come true.. will be back for sure  "
March 2017,6 Stars For Service Alone!,"We've just returned from a two-night stay at The Milestone Hotel in Kensington. I last stayed here on a business trip some eight years ago and remembered it to be very good then, hence wanting to revisit with my wife. That and the fact that according to Tripadvisor, this is the most highly regarded hotel in London and one of the most highly regarded in the world.   So to give my conclusion on those accolades; Yes, I'd say it probably is.   Firstly, the service here is superb. I have never experienced service like it anywhere in the world. The attention to detail is mind blowing frankly.  One memorable example would be the fact that we were staying at the hotel because we were here to see the Harry Potter play; The Cursed Child. I'd had to wait 17 months since purchasing my…"
January 2017,Amazing stay,Stayed here for a week whilst in London and was surprised by the amazing staff and area. The room was stunning with a great view and is in a great location. Would definitely recommend to anyone staying in London.  
February 2017,Wonderful hotel with the very best of service,"Came here for a naughty afternoon tea indulgence, followed by a cocktail in the bar. Difficult to fault this fantastic hotel, which should be mentioned far more often amongst London's best. The tea was superb; far too much food of course. Scones and finger sandwiches to die for and an exceptionally good array of yummy cakes.  Nothing is too much trouble for the staff and the ambience is perfect in a gloriously traditional and old-fashioned sort of way. Very knowledgeable barman, with an obvious interest in traditional and more off the wall cocktails. The location is also great, close to all the facilities in Hyde Park and a short walk to the museums at South Kensington or the shops at Knightsbridge. Mayfair and the West End are only a little further away. Visit the Milestone and…"
February 2017,They've Thought of Every Detail Except...,"The little things like the floating lit candle on the side of the bath when we returned from an evening out, the personal note from the GM, a gift box of biscuits and tea made this 2-day visit truly memorable.  The only thing missing was anyway of making ourselves coffee and tea in the room.  I know the staff would have delivered it in a heartbeat but...  The room was the perfect size for a couple and the bathroom with rain shower was divine.  Two sets of robes (depending on if you wanted it for after the bath or just lounging) and slippers strategically placed bedside (we didn't take them out of the plastic so they can be recycled.)  While we didn't eat there, we did drink in the piano bar (the young woman was delightful) and the Saddlery after dining out.  Both locations were…"
August 2016,Excellent Stay,"Staying here make me feel like living in the paradise, thanks for amazing service and food cooking are great. We've been here for a stay of a mere one night and the hotel still managed to amaze us to a good extent."
March 2017,Wonderful weekend stay,"Recently stayed at this wonderful hotel. Staff were amazing, couldn't do enough for you. It felt like staying at a good friend's home. Every detail was taken care of and the room was so comfortable. Didn't want to leave!"
November 2016,Interesting place,It's a very beautiful hotel. The staff was friendly and the food was delicious. It's interseting as the rooms style of deco was unique which made it different to me. Recommend this place for anyone heading this way.
April 2017,Mittal,"Very poor rooms , totally wrong presentation, non cooperating management.room allowed to us is fully accidentally prone.i won't recommend this hotel , staff has no control.Henry studio suit they should close it ."
March 2017,Loverly,"Hotel is beautifull, the staff lovely, and breakfast delicious.  The rooms are all different style so everytime is nice to come for the suprise.  The suite is also like coming home so much space   Be back soon  ."
March 2017,perfection ,"we stayed at the milestone in november 2013. and since that time i have been telling anyone who will listen that it is my favorite hotel ANYWHERE. and we have stayed at the four seasons in europe and the u.s. and the de russie in rome. (which is in my top 5 favorites) so i was a bit nervous because it is sometimes true, you can't go back again. but not at the milestone. this hotel has all the pampering of any 5 star hotel but it has the warmth of the best boutique hotels. we stayed in a junior suite on the sixth floor and loved the privacy and sort of secluded feel of that floor. the room was spacious and comfortable with a great shower, so important, and a king bed loaded with pillows! i love extra pillows. room service was fast although it was usually just drinks or coffee.…"
March 2017,Wonderful boutique hotel!,"Loved our stay.  Rooms were lovely, nice bathrooms with big and fluffy towels, turndown service with delicious treats. Great concierge.  So helpful.  Excellent service, professional, but friendly and warm.  Highly recommend.  And, excellent location.  "
March 2017,The REAL crown jewel of London!,"I have stayed a lot of places and traveled all over Europe. This is a home I will come back to again, and again. The architecture is stunning and unique, each room having its own character and personality. The staff is beyond amazing. The food is spectacular, and their accommodation of both gluten free AND dairy free (very difficult) was stunning. Our experience was so wonderful, we didn't want to leave. I cannot wait for another excuse to visit London, so that I can return to this lovely jewel. I could write pages of glowing details but the highlights: 1. Location: over looked Kensington Park; close to the High Street Kensington Station; bus stops less than a 1/2 block away. 2. Amazing food, just spectacular. We ate breakfast there every day, indulged in their marvelous Tea and…"
March 2017,Great Location/ Great Service,"My husband and I stayed at the Milestone Hotel while in London.  The location is convenient, the hotel itself is homey, not too big, and the staff were superb.  It seems that they all recognized us and knew who we were from the time we checked in.  We returned to the hotel after a few days in Italy, and they greeted us as old friends.  They went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed. I highly recommend this as a place to stay."
March 2017,Mothers day afternoon tea,"The staff were extremely helpful, could not do enough for you. The sandwiches, cakes and scones were delicious and we were able to take home in a doggy bag what we could not finish. Highly recommended."
February 2017,Amazing ambience,"the is truly a standout property I have ever been to . the staff is so attentive, the food is really nice. the décor the out of the world . loved this place. it was a good choice for us. will visit the milestone soon whenever in London."
October 2016,"Great location, excellent service",I stayed at the Milestone Hotel with a small group last weekend on a quick holiday trip. We booked the Milestone for its proximity to Hyde Park/Kensington but came to find the rooms and service to be exceptional. Thanks so much for making our stay a great one. We look forward to coming back in the future.
February 2017,Best,"Staying here make me feel like living in the paradise, thanks for amazing service and food cooking are great. Best regarding to the manager and chef who had fantastic good job. Amazing better choice to stay and eat with you"
February 2017,Outstanding,"We've been here for a stay of a mere one night and the hotel still managed to amaze us. From the moment the door of our cap was opened upon arrival through check out, absolutely Top notch. The personnel was extremely nice and courteous, always offered to help us and willing to create a stay as good as humanly possible. The hotel room (I recall it to be a deluxe room) was small, but cozy and very welcoming. We only tried the restaurant for an English Breakfast, which was on point. I cannot imagine myself staying in another hotel in London again, definitely got hooked!"
February 2017,Great experience!!,The breakfast was really good and the staff made the effort of remembering your choices inspite of the number of guests they get. Gave that personal touch. Fun music photography play Activities great....
February 2017,Attentive service,"Multiple stays at the Milestone, always with pleasure and gratitude for the high level of attention and the kindness of the staff.  The public rooms are gracious; breakfasts are wonderful; the rooms are comfortably appointed.  The spa/gym area is small, but efficiently organized."
February 2017,Top hotel,"We spend four nights at this hotel.  It deserves its high ranking.  We had Room 105 - pretty much adjacent to the elevator, but you did not hear it.  The room was reasonably spacious for London.  Nice TV with many channels.  The bathroom was very large and very well appointed.  Spectacular is a good word to describe the bathroom.  We used the hotel as a base for sightseeing.  It's about a five minute walk to the Kensington High Street tube stop.  Very nice neighborhood between the hotel and the tube.  The staff was very professional.  We did not partake in any of the amenities offered by the hotel, but I would expect that they are first rate.  We arrived after 11 PM and registration was prompt and without incident.  It was quite cold outside, but the hotel and our room were well…"
February 2017,Wow. We're spoiled forever. ,"We're still here (me with my 16-yr old son) and may never leave. At the very least, I can assure you we may never have an experience like this again. What a hotel! Or, as the spectacular staff refers to it, our ""home."" This is 5 star luxury, with almost more than we can handle in terms of service.  Rooms are spotless and inviting. We're walking and standing all day, and to come back to this magnificence is just delightful!  The staff is perfect. Every one of them is prepared to help in any and every way. Then we have the amenities including the perfect beds, oversized towels, giant screen TV, a newspaper delivered each morning, and the stillness that allows for a nap when needed.   This place is a treat. "
February 2017,Ooh yea,-Exceptional customer service. Staff is super friendly and superprofessional   -Great design of rooms and lobby. The overall ambiance is on a noticeably high level.  -Great facilities such as swimming pool and GYM  -Location is very convenient
January 2017,Any excuse to experience the friendly atmosphere!,"I am lucky to have the opportunity to visit the Milestone Hotel fairly regularly! ALWAYS such a friendly welcome from all the personnel. If you find yourself in the Kensington area and want a delightful break from the hustle & bustle of the great city - Visit the Milestone Hotel - just for a coffee, a visit to the bar or a delightful meal all served by professional and FRIENDLY staff. (Or of course just to pass the  time of day with Patricio at the door)  "
February 2017,Gorgeous hotel in superb location,"Stayed at the Milestone for our wedding anniversary. The staff were sure to notice our anniversary, we were left with lovely goodies in the room on arrival.   Hotel is in a fantastic location right opposite Kensington gardens.  Will be back again!"
April 2016,Great service,"I stayed five nights and couldn't belive how kind  the staff was! My room was amazing, The room service was 100% reliable.It was such a present to stay in this polite, lovely and sophisticated hotel. Thank you so much and see you soon."
March 2017,Lovely service in a charming boutique hotel,"Just got back from a short 4 night stay at the Milestone. We chose it due to its high Tripadvisor ranking and the service was exactly as all the 5-star reviews described. We were upgraded to a King deluxe room that was ready an hour before check-in time. We had to wait a few minutes but we did so in the super cute stable bar (the decor is probably best described as ""equestrian AF"", haha). The room was really lovely with plenty of space and the bathroom was actually huge, especially for a London hotel. Lots of little extras:  - The wake up call comes with a free pot of coffee or tea. - The turn down service dropped off a little treat every night. - Lovely little buns and jam was left in our room on our last night.  - Umbrellas, slippers, robes and adapters in the room for our…"
March 2017,Everything we wished for ,"We booked this at the last minute because it was recommended on the Royal Albert Hall site. What a great choice.From the moment the taxi door was open by a smiling welcome face to our final greeting from Steve, the doorman, we felt very special and valued. Nothing was too much trouble. We stayed in the very beautifully comfortable Kensington Palace suite with a lovely view over the gardens. We loved the thoughtful treats and excellent toiletries. The breakfast was just amazing. Such a wonderful choice and very delicious too. Try the healthier options the combinations are so good. We ate in the restaurant and again it was excellent- especially the Wagu beef. Oh I forgot to mention the stunning cocktail bar with the best cocktails served by really fun barmen. I could go on about…"
March 2017,Better than the ratings suggest I would give 6 out of 5 stars....,"Stayed here for 2 nights last week. Upgraded to a great room with a large outside patio. The thing that most impressed me about this hotel in addition to the great room and location was the service.  Flawless.  From the red carnation in the room to the candle in the bathroom, the little touches were wonderful. Highly recommend."
March 2017,Consistently delightful,"This was the second leg of our own mini Red Carnation Hotels tour in London as an anniversary treat and being opposite Kensington palace and right across from Hyde Park it couldn't have been in a more magical location. From the minute we were helped out of our cab we were impressed with the excellent service and attention to detail. every last member of staff made us feel like we were a special guest, knew our names and our preferences for our stay, but it never felt gushing or intrusive. The room was very comfortable and beautifully appointed and the rainfall shower in the bath - one of the best I've experienced! The bar was fabulous, the interior felt like an impeccably maintained gentleman's members club from the 19th century and the conservatory was a more modern lounge,…"
March 2017,Breathtaking! ,"We wanted to visit London and so we looked for a hotel where we would like to stay. Although there were plenty of other excellent hotels, The Milestone was the one, which we liked best and our decision was absolutely right. From the beginning of our stay until the end, there was nothing that could have been any better.  The staff was always caring and so courteous. We felt very special.  In some other hotels we have been, the people 'had to be nice' to their guests and you did feel that. But at the Milestone, we experienced that everyone is authentic, honest and truly wants to help you make your stay an unforgettable one.  The food was so delicious. I have never eaten so much good food at one place in such a short period of time.  We also went to the SPA, where you can find a…"
March 2017,So kind and courteous,"We stayed three nights and couldn't belive how kind and courteous the staff was!  Our room was amazing, the restaurant...mhmm...delicious! The room service was 100% reliable and after check in, I got a welcome and happy birthday cake as my birthday was a few days ago! Little token from the hotel. Taste of that cake!!! Wow!!!  Every evening weather forecast on a carte in our room.  Our consierge Timothy was that kind I have never met before! Every question was answered perfectly!  It was such a present to stay in this polite, lovely and sophisticated hotel. Thank you so much and see you soon!"
March 2017,Simply wonderful service and sourroundings - a true delight!,"Although only booked at the last minute and chosen due to its proximity to the Royal Albert Hall, I don't think it's possible to have stumbled across a better hotel in London or perhaps even further afield.  Set in a period property on Kensington High Street, this beautiful hotel lies opposite Kensington Gardens and just a few minutes away from the tube station.  I simply cannot fault the service we received during our one-night stay, with the attention to detail and care on display simply mind-blowing. It seems a little unfair to single out any one member of staff as they were all great, but I think Steven the Doorman probably deserves a mention.  We were very lucky to be upgraded to the Kensington Suite, which is simply wonderful, including a lounge downstairs and mezzanine…"
March 2017,Top Notch Experience!,"I recently stayed at the Miletone Hotel, and had an incredible experience! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London. The location was superb and I was consistently shocked by the level of service that I received from all of the members of your fabulous team. Their efforts to ensure that the welcome was always were warm, questions were quickly answered, and everything was handled at the highest level, was incredible and did not go unnoticed.    Checking in, Georgia was an incredible asset and very helpful to me while getting settled into the work week. Andrea was always warm welcome and had the best advice on some of London’s must see places and restaurants!   Stay, relax, enjoy - the Milestone was certainly a phenomenal experience!"
March 2017,Exceptional Experience,"Our family (3 generations) planned a week-long stay in London making the Milestone our home for the entire week, as I had wanted this trip to bring us all together for a very nice time.  We were given adjoining rooms that we could close off as a suite and were welcomed with a series of wonderful sweets and treats and personalized gifts, including lovely book marks from South Africa for my mother and me, and a plate of personalized tea cakes accompanied by a personal hand-written message of congratulations for my daughters who had just finished a set of exams at their school. These things just appeared in our rooms, like magic, and enveloped us in a feeling of well being. Breakfasts at this hotel were outstanding, from delicious tender haddock to kippers, poached eggs on salmon,…"
April 2016,Best hotel in London,"I stayed at the Milestone awhile back and completely forgot to give it a review.  The Milestone is, by far, the best hotel in London. The service is top-notch and second to none. They went out of their way to ensure we were happy with every aspect of our stay. The rooms are very large (by London standards) and tastefully decorated in a traditionally formal manner. We had dinner at the hotel restaurant and it was fantastic. The location also cannot be beat.  All in all - this is one of my favorite hotels in the world. It's like stepping back in time :-). "
February 2017,Exceptional Service,"If you are looking to be in a large hotel, this is not the place for you, but if you are looking for a taste of London at its finest -  the Milestone deserves a worthy mention for exceptional service.  Since we first arrived everything has been impeccable.  For us what makes this hotel stand out from the rest is the level of personal service from everyone we have encountered so far - from Leo who booked my room, Clea who met us at the door and who made sure our stay was enjoyable, the doormen, the wait staff everyone has been friendly and helpful.  Five stars all the way for this"
January 2017,The friendliest hotel ever!,"I have travelled a lot but I have never received such welcoming and friendly treatment from a hotel as the Milestone!  From the open bar due to our rooms not being ready (it was new years day and guests were late to leave) to the smiles and friendly manner of the staff throughout our 9 night stay, it was almost like staying with long lost family.  In fact one staff member suggested we treat the hotel as our home.  The staff were amazing you could not fault them and the rooms were lovely and comfortable.    Our stay was more memorable  when another guest made one night quite unbearable (no fault of the hotel and not despite their best efforts to shut the guest down).  The manager moved us to the largest suite in the hotel (the Tudor Suite). It more than made up for a bad night's…"
February 2017,Not enough great words to describe the Milestone,"The Milestone has been on my bucket list of hotels for several years.  I had very high expectations, and I was not disappointed!  We booked a car from the hotel to pick us up at the airport.  Our driver, Colin, was great!  He made us feel very welcome and gave us lots of information on the ride to the hotel.  When we checked in, we were told we had been upgraded to a deluxe king room.  The room was so quaint and charming, and the decor was perfect for us!  The room overlooked Kensington Gardens.  It was delightful to look out over the park every morning and evening. I had read so many glowing reviews about the hotel staff, and all of them proved to be true!  From housekeeping to the front desk, the concierge to the restaurant staff, they are all so friendly and ready help.  We…"
February 2017,Charming,"We've just returned from a fantastic stay at the Milestone. If you're looking for a large, contemporary hotel, this is not for you. But if you're looking for somewhere which is full of history and character, where you will be looked after wonderfully, then look no further. The staff could not have been nicer - special mention to the lady who gave us a tour of the hotel on arrival (I didn't get her name, sorry) and Andreas at breakfast.  Lots of lovely little touches - complimentary welcome drink on arrival, sweets and biscuits with turndown, as well as a floating candle. High quality tea and coffee tray (on request). Great breakfast - try the pancakes and French toast!  Lovely room overlooking Hyde Park, on the fourth floor. Each room is unique and has individual decor. Hoping…"
February 2017,2nd Great Stay,This is the 2 nd time I have stayed here and the level of service is fantastic the staff cannot do enough for you a special  Mention to Jose on concierge who is absolutely Fantastic at his job  Small quaint hotel which is definitely worth a visit 
January 2017,Old School Luxury with the pinicle of customer service.,"I travel all over the world and have stayed at many 5 star establishments and have never till now felt anywhere above expectation to write a review. The Milestone deserves it. What made this hotel special was the personal service and the attention to detail.  Having arrived from a 12 hour flight in the morning  to sit in the lounge with a roaring fire, up to date magazines made me feel immediately at home. It was the small touches like a coffee whilst they organised my room, even though check in was only to be 6 hours later. Every staff member from reception, concierge, door man, bar staff, floor manager made the entire experience just so personal, but never overbearing or intrusive. The room was old school charm but cleanliness of the highest order. I smiled that even the TV…"
February 2017,Romantic break,"This hotel is just divine. Everything we could have hoped for. The most comfortable bed, amazing food and first class service-nothing was too much trouble. We had candles, rose petals and champagne in our room and tea snuggled by the fire after dinner-it was perfect. We can't wait to come back."
January 2017,Pristine service!,"We absolutely loved this hotel! We stayed there twice this year. If you're looking for a very traditional British hotel, this one will exceed your expectations. If pristine costumer service is what matters most, this place is for you. The staff at The Milestone Hotel were absolutely warm, helpful, welcoming, with great manners, and respectful. They made us feel at home! We will definitely be back."
January 2017,First Class All The Way,"Very impressed with The Milestone Hotel! First class establishment all the way. It's a cozy and romantic place in great location in Kensington. The staff is very friendly, attentive, calls you by your name, and makes you feel like family. We've traveled all around the world and the customer service here is arguably one of the best we've experienced. Let me give you an example. We had tea time scheduled across town one night. The dress was formal. An hour before we were supposed to leave I realized I forgot the navy blue tie that went with my suit. So, I called down to the concierge, Andrea, and asked for stores nearby that sold ties. I even asked if the hotel had something that I could borrow. He said he was going to speak with the general manager. Three minutes later I heard a…"
December 2016,Treated like royalty but felt like at home!,"What a wonderful small personalized elegant hotel this is right across the street from Kensington Park! We were treated as if we owned the hotel the entire time we were there. Service was impeccable, room was lovely, food was divine.  They even put a British Dressage magazine in my room when they found out I was coming to Olympia Horse Show. Now that's service. When we had to leave at 530 in the morning they had breakfast to go with coffee and tea waiting for us in the taxi. I can't wait to go back!"
November 2016,Luxury at it's absolute best!,"Wow! This is probably the best word to summarise our stay at the Milestone. This is hands down the best service that I have had at a hotel anywhere in the world. From the moment you arrive you are ushered into the hotel with friendly and professional service. Mathieu checked us in and was so lovely; He is a big asset to the hotel! We were upgraded to a Deluxe Studio (The Matisse Suite) and to say it was beautiful in an understatement. We were then given a tour of the incredible hotel and shown all the facilities. The hotel itself is beautiful - grand but refined. If you are looking for quintessential British charm, service and sophistication, then this is the place for you.   The Studio is perfection. Upon entry you are presented with a short set of stairs down into the room.…"
August 2016,"Friendly, polite and very very attentive","The Milestone takes great pride in being quintessentially British. It is in a great location, right across the street from the Kensington gardens and a short walk to any of 3-4 tube stations.  Everyone here is super attentive to detail. We had a lot of folks help us out with our plans for the day and the easiest ways to get around (especially with a toddler in tow).  We've heard great things about the afternoon tea, but unfortunately could not make it. The rooms were great, service even better. We did not want for anything, happy to be back!"
December 2016,🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟,Anything less than 5 stars would be an insult. Hands down the best hotel I've ever stayed in. Then again at the rates charged I would expect that. If your not shy of splashing cash then try it out....
May 2016,Most beautiful hotel and staff! ,"Loved this hotel so much, so beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough for you,really made the stay more memorable! Would go back again 100%! Can highly recommend anyone to have a stay here, worth the money. "
November 2016,An outstanding stay at The Milestone,"My husband and 4 grown sons spent Thanksgiving weekend at the Milestone and it was truly a magical experience! The rooms were spacious, and beautifully appointed with up to date amenities (including the bathrooms), while  the charming decor mirrors the old world style of the hotel. Breakfast, (included with our rooms) was more than substantial ( a beautiful buffet was served and additional menu items cooked to order were available.   The staff was top notch and made sure our stay was an experience to remember and every need was met. Leo, the Duty manager; Jose head concierge;  Andre deputy concierge; Guillaume concierge; Magda, the breakfast hostess and many more all excelled at their jobs!  The Milestone's location is perfect because it is directly across the street from lovely…"
November 2016,Fabulous afternoon tea,"We visited this hotel for afternoon tea to celebrate my sisters 65th birthday there were 7 of us and we were looked after very well. We had a lovely table and the food was delicious and plentiful. All the staff from the young lady who greeted us to the concierge made us very welcome. A very special mention to Fabrizio, Andreas, Lukas and Malcolm the pianist who played all our requests. I would recommend this hotel and would visit again."
December 2016,"Great hotel, great location","Spent two nights at this Grade 2 Listed hotel in Kensington, London. Never been there before although I'm familiar with that part of London. Beautifully presented and professionally staffed, it is everything I expect from a high end hotel. The room was comfortable and well appointed, the food delicious and the location - directly opposite Kensington Gardens (an extension of Hyde Park) and a few minutes walk from Harrods, three of London's great museums and much else besides, made it, for us, a perfect place to stay. BUT - be warned - the huge afternoon tea could sink a battle ship."
February 2016,Absolutely amazing,"I absolutely enjoyed my stay at The Milestone and it is not The last time I'll be visiting.  The service, The style, The suite - everything was Perfect!  I enjoyed three days at this amazing property and it was worth every penny!   They have The most wondeful breakfast and bar as well.   5 Stars is Way underestimated!"
January 2017,A great stay,"This is my second time at the Milestone Hotel, and the experience has been, if possible even better than the first time, everyone makes you feel home, with spacial attention. Is the Hotel i can suggest to everyone looking for something special!"
January 2017,Wow. Just wow.,"We got an upgrade to a junior suite, overlooking Kensington Gardens an Palace. Staff were extremely friendly, funny and helpful. We felt like friends, not guests. Breakfast was great, too. We will be back,"
January 2017,Just fantastic,Brilliant location and interior and the most attentive helpful staff we've ever encountered. There aren't many places we'd go back to but this is certainly top of that list. We were spoiled rotten from beginning to end.
January 2017,Amazing stay,We spent a night at The Milestone during January.  We chose this hotel as it was close to the Royal Albert Hall and also as a special treat for my wifes birthday (one of the those with a 0 on the end!)  We had a fantastic stay.  Upon arrival all staff were very polite and helpful.  We had arrived a little early and were offered complimentary snacks and drink while our room was prepared.  We were also advised that we had been upgraded to a studio room.   Upon arrival at our room my wife had been left a birthday chocolate cake and some biscuits along with a personalised note wishing her a Happy Birthday. We had a great afternoon at the Royal Albert Hall and returned to the hotel several hour later.  Again we were greeted by name at the door and asked if we had enjoyed the RAH and…
January 2017,Wonderful!,"We spent 2 nights at the Milestone and it was a wonderful experience. From the minute we arrived we knew that we had made a great choice. The staff were amazing, the hotel rooms spotless and super comfy and the breakfast fare delicious. I have stayed at a lot of places over the years and this one tops the list. We will definitely be back. Thank you Milestone for a wonderful visit."
January 2017,Exceptional,"Second time at the Milestone - an exceptional hotel in London. Looked after like family from start to finish - nothing is too much trouble for any of the team. Rooms are immaculate, comfortable and quiet and the attention to detail sets a standard few might surpass. Andrew Pike should be very proud.  Thank you again. "
January 2017,Another excellent Red Carnation Hotel,"First time at The Milestone having visited other excellent Red Carnation Hotels and it was a wonderful experience, with personal touches to make the stay extra enjoyable. Super food and helpful, friendly staff. Would definitely go back along with other Red Carnation Hotels."
January 2017,Incredible London hotel,"In the previous year my wife and I have had the good fortune to have stayed at the Savoy, Dorchester and Milestone. When it came to choosing a place to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary we opted rot eh Milestone.   The Savoy was impressive to look at but we weren't made to feel special in any way. The Dorchester treated us like honoured guests, the Milestone treated us like treasured friends, and that includes our large dog. Hence we opted to return to the Milestone for our 2nd anniversary  The moment we walked in we were treated with great warmth from all the staff, from the doorman, the concierge, and receptionists, to room service and in the restaurant. Nothing was too much trouble and when they found out we were celebrating our anniversary we got cards and momentos from…"
November 2016,Brilliant Customer Service,"Thank you for such a fantastic night's stay! All members of staff made the stay incredible memorable and enjoyable, including the customer relations manager on arrival, the housekeeping staff for an immaculately clean and imaginative bedroom, Augustin was such a wonderful host of a waiter for dinner and the smoked salmon and Dover Sole was simply scrumptious! A sensational hotel with amazing staff."
November 2015,Anniversary stay ,"This hotel group demonstrates customer service at its absolute best.   It is literally the best ever experience I have ever had, this and the sister hotels are always 1,2 or 3 on TripAdvisor book your stay to find out why even if it's for 1 night!"
October 2016,Excellent stay,"We arrived late Saturday afternoon and used the valet parking, very helpful and efficient friendly chap, who helped us with luggage and parked the car very easily. Check in, reception very friendly, we had a tour of the beautiful hotel and then to our room, the gentleman was very helpful with our belongings and making sure the room was comfortable. Very comfortable stay our room was very well decorated, very clean and exceptionally comfortable. The hotel made sure our every need was catered too including lavender pillows and memory foam. We used the leisure facilities which were lovely and breakfast was spectacular. A very lovely stay. "
October 2016,Blueprint for outstanding customer service.,"We stayed as a treat for our anniversary. The hotel is gorgeous. Staff are amazing, very friendly and welcoming, but also very professional. The cocktails in the bar are delicious and the room was stunning. Very comfy and well decorated with the theme of the hotel. Pool and sauna well tucked away but very relaxing and breakfast in the morning was one of the nicest I've had anywhere. Would thoroughly recommend and will always use this for stays in London. 5 stars well deserved."
September 2016,The Milestone Hotel to the Rescue,"Everything about this hotel is 5 plus stars. We stayed 4 nights with 2 other couples at Milestone on an Insight Luxury Gold vacation package. We also stayed at a 5 star boutique hotel in Paris. There was no comparison. Milestone is in a class by itself. All of us felt appreciated and comfortable.  The staff are always there to help and make you feel like a valued guest. It's clean, beautify decorated with an excellent breakfast menu. Housekeeping is exceptional but make sure you hang the card on the door saying the room is ready. We forgot one day and it wasn't made up until 8:30 that night. We have stayed at numerous 5 star properties and Milestone is the best."
October 2016,Be spoilt like a treasured friend (and dog),"We arrived in London on a rainy Saturday night after an arduous flight from Rome. Our taxi took us to the hotel where we had our booking arranged located in Bloomsbury. We were ready to unpack and relax after a long day. We were greeted instead by a hotel that was boarded up and closed for renovation. We had never been notified inspite of having a confirmed booking. Time to scramble with a taxi meter running! I had stayed at The Montague on the Garden, a Red Carnation Hotel, previously; so we went there since it was nearby. They had no rooms available but offered to call The Milestone. We accepted their offer of a room on the spot. The idea of driving around London on a Saturday night in the rain trying to find a hotel did not appeal. After a 150 GBP cab fare we arrived at The…"
July 2016,Worth visiting ,"The hotel has all the facilities, which are expected while staying in a hotel.  The people are all welcoming and smiling.  The cafe staff is nice and reception is warm and energetic.  A good stay to remember. "
November 2016,The Best Hotel in London?,"It's so easy when visiting London to fall into the trap of booking the nearest ""chain"" hotel to ones desired location.  I'm so glad that I broke this habit by listening to Tripadvisor and then booking a room at the Milestone.  This charming expression of old-world values is a true gem of a hotel amongst the throng of ""room boxes"" to be found across the city.  Every room at the Milestone is uniquely furnished and appointed and the public areas are beautifully decorated and adorned with traditional furnishings and works of art.  However, the most impressive aspect of this hotel is the superb team of staff who appear to take genuine pleasure in ensuring that every guest is treated like royalty.  I will never again book a 4/5 star chain hotel in London while The Milestone continues…"
January 2017,A Highlight of our Vacation!,"Family of 3 with an 11 year old boy. We arrived in a taxi and when the doorman opened the door, he greeted us by name. They had no idea when we were arriving (and presumably no idea what we looked like). That first impression properly set the stage for a two-night stay in one of the only hotels we have ever raved about. Truthfully, we found the room slightly small, but everything else was 6-star service. Amazingly friendly staff who knew us, multiple people who bent over backwards to assist us with dinner and travel reservations, personal care appointments, the works. Bartenders remembered what we like to drink. Maid service added special touches for each of us. The Milestone was simply amazing up and down. And even when they were fully booked for the afternoon tea, they created…"
October 2016,A wonderful experience,"My husband and I recently spent 2 nights at The Milestone and had a marvelous stay. I selected the hotel due to its proximity to The Royal Albert Hall as we had tickets to a performance. We had previously stayed at other Red Carnation properties so were familiar with the high standard of service and attention to detail, again we were not disappointed. From our initial welcome to our final goodbye the staff were superb - professional, courteous and could not do enough to assist. Our room was comfortable and cosy with so many well thought out details and the bathroom very spacious and well stocked. I loved the nightly turn down service with different sweets left each night. Breakfast was excellent and on our second morning  4 couples arrived at once to an already busy dining room…"
October 2016,Exceptional Stay,"From the moment my wife & I entered the Milestone we were overwhelmed by the courtesy of all the staff. An example & a fantastic gesture was an immediate upgrade in room, due to our Silver Wedding Anniversary celebration (thank you once again).  The attention to detail tells you everything about this Hotel, spotless, articulate, precise and thoughtful. (Rose petals and candles in the bedroom on the night of our anniversary was lovely).  Ideally located for the Royal Albert Hall, the Tube and Kensington Gardens this is an exceptional hotel. "
October 2016,The Milestone Hotel,"The hotel, opened in the 1920s, takes its name from the old cast iron milestone that stands outside and comprises three tall Victorian townhouses, the first of which, No 1 Kensington Court, has fine original features, including carved window frames and a black-and-white tiled floor. It stands on busy Kensington Road, near where it becomes Kensington High Street, with views of Kensington Park opposite. The hotel is small scale: with minimal outside space, cosy public rooms, including a very pretty Victorian style sitting room, and bedrooms on five floors. The decoration, in the style of Red Carnation’s owner and chief designer, Beatrice Tollman, is expansive, generous and elaborate, spilling over into fussiness, especially in such a small space, with flowing fabrics, cushions,…"
October 2016,Wouldnt stay anywhere else in London!,"We stayed for my husbands 50th birthday, and it was fantastic. We were upgraded on arrival. Staff friendly, attentive and there to please the guests (they are passionate about their jobs, and this shows in the level of service received from all)  The rooms are beautifully luxurious, scrupulously clean, and everything has been considered to make your stay wonderful. Turn down service with nightly treats, stunning Penhaligon toiletries and anything extra thats required is seen to immediately.  A  complimentary birthday cake was left in our room, and a birthday card, we also had complimentary champagne during our afternoon tea. A truly magical stay......thank you."
January 2017,Amazing Hotel in the heart of London,"My wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary at the Milestone and our stay was as much an experience as seeing the sights of London.  Right from our arrival we were treated with amazing hospitality, and we could get helpful advice from the personnel whenever we needed it. They went to extraordinary lengths to make our stay great by leaving surprises - like rose petals and chocolate - in our room for us to find upon returning to the hotel. The personnel held themselves up to a very high standard in order to leave a lasting impression on their guests.  Our room had plenty of space and was beautifully furnished. We had a round window overlooking the park across from the hotel - it was quite a sight. The room had was equipped with AC and it as possible to set the lighting…"
January 2017,Always excellent ,"This is the second time I have visited this hotel and it did not disappoint. The moment you walk in you feel important and appreciated without being intimidated. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly and couldn't do more. The rooms are spacious, clean and luxurious without being unfriendly. The welcome drink was appreciated and we will definitely be back again. Thank you for a fantastic stay it made our anniversary special. "
January 2017,Trip Highlight,"The Milestone is anything but your run of the mill hotel in a large city. It is in fact the contrast that makes it so special. Noise is replaced by a peaceful respite. Hustle and bustle is replaced by elegance and charm. Rudeness and dirt is replaced by superb etiquette and cleanliness. There is not a single detail left to chance from the moment the concierge and reception greet you on property. Many thanks to the entire staff for their attention and courtesy. We especially enjoyed our evening final final at the small hotel bar now housed in the former stables. I had the best ""smoked"" old fashion while my husband enjoyed a delightful aged whiskey. Kensington is a perfect location for everything......The Milestone is a special memory of this visit to London and one we would…"
February 2016,Only place to stay in London ,Food great.  Rooms great.  Service great. First name basis with everyone.  People worried about all your needs.  Great location.   You can't go wrong.   Everything has a personal touch and the little things that matter are evident in the care of this hotel.
January 2017,Like returning home,"Another return to the Milestone, this time with our family, et al, of 12.  From the moment we arrived we were warmly welcomed, and even though it was late well looked after.  From the bespoke cocktail mixing exhibition in the bar, to High Tea, to Steve the doorman making my grandson his assistant, with top hat and all, the concierge staff, beautiful rooms  . . . our stay was brilliant."
January 2017,The perfect birthday celebration hotel,"Stayed 2 nights and held an afternoon tea party in their intimate function room. Service was impeccable and made to feel very welcome. Atmosphere is relaxed and friendly. I chose the hotel as it was dog friendly. My dog was allowed in the room, and in an annex for breakfast and the conservatory for a relaxed drink. A real rarity to be able to stay in luxury along with my dog. Food was a good standard for the afternoon tea. I would recommend this hotel and I will definitely stay there again. Perfect location just across from Kensington Palace for a visit or just a walk around their gardens with the dog."
January 2017,Best Hotel in the UK - My Favorite in the world. Easily the best service and staff in the world.,"This is an incredibly classy, unique and very cool hotel - and is the UK's hidden gem.  It is literally like stumbling on Britain's best kept secret. Even many Londoners don't know it.  Traditional and beautiful the rooms are luxurious and super comfortable. The bar and conservatory are private, intimate and cool. The Lounge and restaurant are relaxed and food great. The views over Hyde Park are unparalleled - but even the rooms without the view are so great and all rooms are a welcome retreat from busy days in London.  The service here in my opinion is unmatched - anywhere - I have ever been in the world. And thats coming from the west coast of the US where we are spoilt with service with a smile. I can't praise the staff here enough - they are so welcoming, helpful and nothing…"
November 2016,I wished I lived here!,"An exceptional hotel in London. Rooms are so clean, comfortable and quiet and the attention to detail is awesome! Great stay always satisfied! Thank you guys you always treat me and my family like royalty!"
January 2017,Superb stay!,"We stayed last night for my wife's birthday and had a fantastic time. We were upgraded to a stunning suite with multiple rooms, two fireplaces and a cozy to nook with bookshelves. The service is amazing - possibly the best I've experienced. Keep up the great work!"
February 2016,Beautiful,"I stayed here a couple of times in the past and had a lovely stay. Staff were pleasant and helpful, food was delicious and rooms were cosy and comfortable. Highly recommended. A great location for seeing the city."
October 2016,Great Boutique Hotel and Amazing Service,"My wife and I recently spent a long weekend in London and had such a wonderful time at the Milestone. While the hotel is little pricey, it is well worth it based off of service, location and facilities.  Service -I can only use one word to describe- unbelievable. Everyone was so nice and attentive, it was worth the price itself. You felt a different vibe at this hotel vs. some of the large chains that are available in every city. People would greet you by name and would go out of their way to speak with you and help you get where you needed to go.  Location -The hotel is located on the Southwest corner of Hyde Park and is less than a five minute walk to Kensington Palace. The park is easy to navigate and is so beautiful. As New Yorkers, we loved walking through the different…"
October 2016,Best Service and Cutest Hotel,I stayed at the Milestone for 4 nights on a trip with my friends.  It was one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in and the service was unbeatable - he wake up call in the morning comes with delicious coffee and/or tea and the concierge is extremely helpful.  The milestone truly felt like my home for the four days i stayed there.  I Will definitely be back here again!
November 2016,Traditional and beautiful!,"I am new to Trip Advisor but just wanted to comment at the fantastic service at the Milestone. Went for afternoon tea for my mum's 50th. It was well organised, relaxed & the hotel itself is absolutely beautiful. They even gave us a tour around the hotel after our tea so we could see the rooms and facilities they provide. One of the best afternoon teas I've been to! Definitely recommend. Thank you for the fantastic service! Could not fault it in the slightest..."
July 2016,Beautiful suite,"Stayed for one night for a little weekend break with my partner, and it was amazing.  We had a drink at the hotel bar on our arrival, and were informed there was an error with our booking. They instead upgraded us to one of suites, which was an incredibly beautiful room. It was spread across two floors, with a seating area upstairs as well as ""hidden"" bathroom and walk in wardrobe. Below the mezzanine was the bedroom with huge bed and another luxurious bathroom. All the suite was designed very opulently with an old world feel.  Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, and I thoroughly enjoyed my short stay here. Would loved to have stayed for longer, but will definitely return."
November 2016,Exceptional Service and Great Location,"This hotel has everything you need to make your stay in London a pleasure. First, service is exceptional. The facility is immaculate and the staff warm, efficient and accommodating. Next, the location is ideal - right around the corner from the Tube, lots of shopping, restaurants, attractions and parks. Spent 6 days at the Milestone on business/pleasure and will certainly return the next time I am in town."
October 2016,Wonderful wedding. ,"My youngest daughter had her wedding reception at the Milestone. 6 of us stayed for 2 nights. We were upgraded on some of the rooms, the bride and groom had a suite, which was beautiful.  The whole process of organising the reception was easy and stress free. It was only a small wedding but it still needed to be perfect. We were given a champagne reception by the hotel, a lovely gesture. There were 4 vegans to be catered for and the head chef was brilliant with suggestions. Each of the 5 courses was delicious.  We had 9 people for breakfast, the morning after the wedding, and so were given the use of the room where the reception was held. This meant we could be as noisy as we liked and not upset other guests. There's nothing worse than a group of boisterous people when you are…"
November 2016,Service beyond compare,"The staff of this hotel are always ready with a genuine smile, and will do whatever needs to be done to make your stay the best it can be. Notable are the Concierge Andrea, and the doorman Steven, whom both were the epitome of professional, as well as friendly in help with transportation to and from meetings, restaurants suggestions for business, as well as ideas for downtime based on my schedule and preferences. The hotel itself is comfortable, impeccably maintained,with proximity to whatever your reason for visiting may be. The restaurant offers tea time, the bar is cozy... the  fantastic service is what you'll remember most."
October 2016,Fabulous!,"Unfortunately, our stay was for one night only - we would have loved to have stayed longer at this wonderful hotel.  On arrival, around 1.00 pm, our room wasn't ready so we were escorted to the bar and provided with complimentary champagne - what a lovely introduction to the Milestone Hotel!    We were later escorted to our room which was sumptuously furnished with beautiful fabrics and linens.  A personalised welcome card, signed by the manager, was in the room, together with a box of handmade biscuits, a box of teabags and, rather strangely, a single, beautifully wrapped prune!  Nice touches.  The bathroom was spacious and plenty of fluffy, white towels were provided.  Penhaligon toiletries were plentiful.  We experienced a slight fly in the ointment when we went for a drink…"
October 2016,"Outstanding Hospitality, Loverly Hotel","This may just be the perfect London hotel. My husband and I have stayed in many hotels in London, however none had the client service and hospitality of the Milestone. Everything about our stay was delightful. Matthew in reception was very friendly and did all he could to accommodate us with an early check-in. The room was beautifully decorated and the king bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was a nice size and high quality toiletries were replenished every day. Complimentary coffee was delivered to our room following an early morning wake-up call. What a wonderful detail! The breakfast service was lovely. We had the continental so can't comment on the full breakfast. The coffee was very good as well as the fresh orange juice and all the cereals, yogurts, breads and…"
October 2016,Elegant and friendly,"The hotel is within ten minutes of High Street Kensington subway station and just across the street form Kensington park.  The room was well appointed and quiet.  Room service delivered a paper each morning and turned down the bed each evening.    The concierge was extremely helpful, acquiring tickets to a sold out show and giving exacting directions to various sights.    The food was excellent.  Our day started with a superb breakfast.  Hight tea was also a must.  This hotel will be what we measure other hotels against for excellence."
January 2017,Service and Location are Top Notch,"My friend and I stayed at the Milestone for the first week of January while we visited London. We had a great stay. When we arrived, we were greeted and told that we had been updated to a studio and that our room would be available in a few hours (we arrived in the early morning). We went to the dining room and had a wonderful breakfast while we waited.   Our room was lovely. Very spacious, comfortable, and quiet. There are many services included in the room fee, but we didn't take advantage of most of them. When we did need anything, the staff was friendly and fast to respond. A friend sent a bottle of champagne to our room, and we received a very nice personal note from the manager along with the bottle on ice. There were treats left for us each evening at turn down, and a few…"
November 2016,Best Luxurious hotel with excellent service,"My wife and I stayed at this best luxurious hotel which was classic British style. From the moment we go, we found greeted with warm and best friendly staff. Our best room was beautiful with all the amenities including comfy bathrobesssssss and slipperssssssss. The staff was extremely helpful in planning to our day which made our visit a memorable one. The dining staff provided excellent service and the meals were deliciousssssss. Afternoon tea is a must! One of the best hotels we've ever stayed in."
December 2016,Luxurious hotel with excellent service,"My daughter and I stayed at this luxurious hotel which was tastefully decorated in classic British style.  From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with warm and friendly staff.  Our room was beautiful and cozy with all the amenities including comfy bathrobes and slippers.  The concierge staff was extremely helpful in planning our day which made our visit a memorable one.  The dining staff provided excellent service and the meals were delicious.   Afternoon tea is a must!  One of the best hotels we've ever stayed in."
December 2016,Exceptional Service!,"Everything about the Milestone was beyond our greatest expectations.  I have traveled many places and stayed in 5 star hotels but this trip was extra special.  Everything from the location, staff and rooms were top notch.  I am a stickler for customer service and The Milestone staff did not disappoint.  They are amazing!  We stayed for 8 nights and never got tired of the fantastic breakfasts and the delicious evening treats.  I highly recommend the chicken pot pie."
October 2016,"Professional, personalized, and posh","Booked a stay at this hotel for an anniversary trip to London and we absolutely enjoyed our stay from start to finish. Our original booking was upgraded for us as a nice ""anniversary present"" and we couldn't have been more pleased. Our room had a king-sized bed, large flat screen tv, large closet and dresser, and bathtub large enough to soak in. I'm not sure if they have an evening maid service, but it was so nice to come home after a day of sightseeing to find that our slippers were set out by the bed, an evening treat on the coffee table, and soft music playing for us.   The location is a short walk to the Kensingston High Street underground station and all our taxi drivers knew of the hotel which made coming back home incredibly easy. Across from the hotel is Kensington…"
October 2016,Business or Pleasure Always Exceptional,"Have stayed here 3 times each time surpassing the previous stay for comfort, location, room quality and staff The Cheneston offers superb cuisine, prepared and plated masterfully. Many nights ended with a Vintage Port in the Bar The staff go out of their way to meet every request with a smile and prompt solution! All in all a superb stay every time.   And I love Kensington!!!!"
October 2016,Our favorite London hotel,"The Milestone is our go-to hotel on every visit to London. It is exquisite and the staff and service are exemplary.  It's hard to describe the wonderful experience that the Milestone provides and the quality and decor of it's accommodations. It well deserves its five star rating and while, like much of London, it is expensive, we have found that they do offer deals and have been upgraded on each visit.  Their restaurant is of high quality as is their high tea and evening lounge. Located directly across from Kensington Palace and Park, the home of William and Kate and in the shopping and restaurants of Kensington."
October 2016,Absolutely Excellent! (from a discerning traveler),"We stayed in Oct 16 to celebrate our wedding anniversary and to visit Frieze / Frieze Masters.  Exceptional quality, exceptional professionalism and thoughtful, personal touch in every respect.  Great location.  We have traveled the world and rarely stay at the same place twice.  We look forward to returning to the Milestone.  Thank you Andrea (concierge) and Colin (chauffeur) and team for making our stay so special."
October 2016,Beautiful place,"We have stayed in the Maidstone apartment with our kids. We had 2 bedrooms, a living room, kitchen and used all of the hotel's amenities. Service was amazing and we felt we just lived in London, away from the tourist scene."
March 2016,Milestone Magnificence,What a great stay in a lovely hotel! Location was perfect and main attractions within walking distance....service from the time I arrived to the time I left was amazing and exceptional.....loved my room with a gorgeous view of Kensington gardens.....will return again one day!
September 2016,Wife's birthday weekend ,"My partner and I stayed at the Milestone Hotel, Kensington for 3 nights in Dec 2016.  The hotel is wonderfully historic and the staff are wonderfully supportive and attentive.  Our room was small but very serviceable (2nd floor.)  Please note - the pillows are very soft but the staff will switch out upon request.  Even though my ""dual voltage"" hair appliance did create a small flame and singe my hair, the staff weren't outwardly judgemental and even offered house devices to use or also to purchase a new device (local voltage) like mine for use during the rest of my stay.  Although the hotel kept requesting access to clean our room, for environmental purposes (less water, detergent, electricty usage) we declined access until the end of our stay.  I hope in future the hotel will…"
January 2017,Classic British boutique hotel with 5 star service.,"We came here to celebrate my wife's birthday and it did not disappoint, we did get an upgrade to a wonderful room. Beautifully appointed and set up. The staff were attentive without being in your face. The attention to small details is what made this unique. The hotel tour, the card left in the room, the books left on the turndown service, the candle in the bathroom. I could go on. Magnificent weekend with wonderful breakfast to finish our stay. Never got to the gym / spa, maybe next time. Highly recommended stay. "
January 2017,"Excellent, Homely, Property","This hotel is charming and lovely with staff beyond compare. Every person we met was kind and gracious, friendly and warm, and eager to help make our stay as lovely as possible. Room service was extremely prompt, bar tenders were charming, dining staff gracious and accommodating, and the concierge worked tirelessly to help us with our plans daily. We were traveling with two children making up our plans as we went and they couldn't have been kinder. The entire staff seemed to magically know our names as soon as we crossed the threshold- including the children.  The rooms are British cosy with ample room to circulate and lovely marble baths. The linens are fine and generously supplied. There is free bottled water everywhere you turn, lovely toiletries and flowers as one would…"
December 2016,Perfect,"The Milestone Hotel is absolutely fantastic if you're looking for a cozy place that will take excellent care of you. Anything you need is just a phone call away and will be delivered with a smile and genuine care. We went for our honeymoon; when the butler discovered this, he decorated our room and left us a handwritten letter congratulating us."
November 2016,Home sweet home,"We had a wonderful weekend!  Great hotel, good position the rooms are lovely and comfy!  The staff is polite and very hospital. We had a very romantic weekend and the location is very well connected which for a short stay is really necessary. We definitely will come back. "
October 2016,"The true ""Crown Jewel"" of London","Staying several weeks during the last 2 years in this wonderful historic institution, allowed me to feel more at home each time visiting. An oasis in this buzzing city, nostalgic... the latest house technology is surely not needed, as the wonderful and friendly staff will compensate for anything a person may require or wish for. The breakfast Truly must be one of the best in the world, convincing through the combination of a tiny but very effective buffet plus the more than sufficient a la carte options. Room service is also so tasty, Someone can skip on a restaurant meal outside easily. Overall one of my favourite places to stay, also convenient having the park right across the road, not too many traffic issues  and a large choice of entertainment and restaurants in walking…"
December 2016,Excellent stay...loved it!,"I don't even know where to begin to describe our perfect experience at The Milestone Hotel in London. It was my daughter's and my first visit to London and I couldn't ask for a more wonderful vacation. Every person on the staff is so kind, helpful, and polite. They remember your name, and always are eager to make sure you are always satisfied. From the doormen, the concierge, the people in the various restaurants, housekeeping, room service...they are truly professional and have wonderful personalities. Our room was so elegant and comfortable and it was extremely clean. The hotel is well kept and maintained perfectly. The lobby is very inviting and there are so many adorable and quaint rooms to have a lovely meal, afternoon tea, a drink. It's a real treasure. The best review I…"
September 2016,Yet Again Another Great Stay,"We stayed at the Milestone at the beginning of September for my husband's 40th Birthday, this was our second stay and again it was another fabulous experience. We arrived around 3:30 and our room wasn't yet ready so they gave us a glass of champagne for having to wait (this was on top of our welcome drink). It was so nice to relax and have a lovely glass of bubbly. We were then taken up to our beautiful room which was so well appointed. The point of our stay was to relax and that's exactly what we did. I had a lovely bath in the beautifully large bathroom before getting ready to head out to dinner. Our room had a choice of two different type of bathrobes which was a very nice touch. One thing to note is that we had an issue with the temperature in our room and we flagged it with…"
October 2016,Excellente,Don't miss the chance to visite this nice and elegante place one of the best food is excellent service is one of the best in the world activities are so good you actually enjoy every singel day in this nice place with diferent experience 
February 2016,Amazing hotel!,"The staff was very polite, food was fantastic also. All in All I would rate this hotel 5 out of 5 stars! I was with my family, everyone liked the environment, people were friendly. We spent hours in the cozy lounge area. The hotel is tastefully and thoughfully decorated."
September 2016,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay ,"We appreciated all of the special touches The Milestone provided during our stay. Each day started with a fantastic breakfast where we felt waited on hand and foot. I especially appreciated that they remembered my coffee order after the first morning and not only served me a vanilla latte- light on the vanilla with each breakfast, but also made me one ""to go"" to take with me sightseeing. Each evening we were greeted with soft music, lit candles and special treats in our room. I loved our larger than average hotel bathroom and all the products that were provided. Dinner was beautifully done in the dining room and the hotel itself was so quaint and full of character. We would not hesitate to recommend to others or return ourselves. "
September 2016,A Wonderful Hotel,My stay at The Milestone Hotel was fabulous!! The staff is gracious and welcoming. We walked in The Kensington Gardens right across the street. I will definitely stay there again when back in London!!
October 2015,Fantastic Find,"I chose this hotel because of its proximity to The Royal Albert Hall and what a find! The room I book overlooks Kensington Gardens, what a view to wake up to. I have stayed a number of times (wish it could be more) and have never been disappointed, the room is clean and very well appointed, comfortable bed and very quiet. The staff are fantastic nothing is too much trouble, you only have to ask and if it's possible they deliver. I have also got to know some members of the team, they have been there since I have been staying, another good sign of a happy working environment and good management They show a great interest in what your doing during your stay and look after you so well. It is a relatively small hotel which I like, I find the large hotels very impersonal. I will…"
September 2016,Pleasure / Vacation,"Can't say enough about this outstanding boutique hotel.  Outstanding staff, excellent location and extremely comfortable / warm accommodations and facilities.    From the moment we came through the front door - the staff knew our names and we wanted for nothing.    Dining - both breakfast and dinners were quite good, high tea was super and very much liked the bar!  Would highly recommend."
September 2016,Milestone Hotel,"Simply suberb, there is nothing about this place that isn't first rate, including the daily rate but if you want the best you have to pay for it.  It is a little cheaper for Americans now that the pound is down.  Nice location, right across the street from Kesington Gardens"
September 2016,Amazing Stay!,"My husband and I stayed at the Milestone Hotel for 3 nights.  While there, we were treated like royalty!  It was our 28th Anniversary so while we were out, they had put rose petals on our bed in the shape of a heart and also left some delicious chocolates!  Candles were lit in both the bedroom and bathroom.  Food was also excellent.  The staff, especially Patricio made our stay incredible. This trip was booked through Costco Travel. Thanks to all the staff at the Milestone for a most memorable stay!"
September 2016,Extraordinary Hotel!,"My husband and I stayed at the Milestone for four nights during our recent visit to London. What a treat! Everything about our visit was perfect. Our room was beautifully decorated, the bathroom was updated with a great shower, the food was delicious and the service was impeccable. After a day of traveling, the complimentary cocktail on our arrival was just what we needed. This is truly a unique, service-oriented, luxury hotel. We look forward to returning to the Milestone; our new favorite hotel in London."
October 2015,"Pleasure trip, birthday ","This was three years ago & our first trip to London, bottom line, if you are staying @ this end of london please stay @ the milestone hotel, if you are staying in the center of london please stay @ the ritz, two perfect hotels in a perfect & entertaining & safe city & by the way use the tube & please go to a play "
September 2016,Amazing stay,Stayed at milestone for five days was impressed by the friendly and helpful staff who took care of every aspect with precision and warmth The food was excellent and the pancakes and waffles for breakfast were delicious  The property by itself was amazing and the interiors beautiful Would love to go back again!!!
September 2016,Impeccable,"I did not stay here but visited the hotel for a business meeting followed by drinks in the Stables bar. This hotel is a hidden gem- oozing charm, luxury and character but without being overly stuffy too. All the staff were unbelievable. Cocktails in the bar were out of this world- you must try the old fashioned- the way it is served it awesome! It's quiet and hidden away- thought twice about writing this review- like to keep it hidden and quiet- shhh :)"
September 2016,A Lovely London Honeymoon at The Milestone,"My wife and I had a four night stay in the Harlequin Suite for our honeymoon.  We had a wonderful time at the Milestone Hotel.  It was a pleasure to be in a quieter part of town with easy access to tourist attractions, the Kensington Gardens, and Central London.  The staff, (especially the concierge), made us feel like part of the Milestone family.  We look forward to having the chance to go back and visit London soon.  I would highly recommend this hotel!"
June 2016,First Class Hotel,"We have stayed at the Milestone three times, with the experience getting better each time. The rooms are amazing and beautifully decorated.  My family and I returned to the Milestone in June and we felt like we were returning to our own private hotel, with every one of the staff making my family feel special.  When returning from a long day of sightseeing, the staff will give you a warm welcome and inquire about your day.  It is a boutique hotel with first class facilities, dining and staff.  When in London, we much prefer to stay at the Milestone Hotel, which is very special to my family."
September 2016,Treated Like Royalty!,"A big ""thank you"" to the wonderful staff at the Milestone!  You made my Mom's ""milestone"" birthday a magnificent occasion.  The service was impeccable, the accommodations are beautiful, and the restaurant is world class.  Every member of the staff is kind and helpful; they sincerely cannot do enough for you!  As far as hotels are concerned, the Milestone is absolute perfection.  We loved the Milestone so much that it will be our home away from home when in London.  And, to that end, we have already booked our return visit."
September 2016,Hard to fault - top of the pile,"In a city with so many very good hotels, The Milestone manages to stand high, and certainly up there amongst the greats.   We have just enjoyed a 2 night weekend in London, and it was our first stay at The Milestone - and we sincerely hope to return.   Just about faultless, this property and its staff set and achieve very high standards, but do so in an understated and very warm, welcoming way.   A gem in central London - thank you. "
September 2016,Fantastic first stay in London,"We originally wanted to stay at another hotel, but landed at The Milestone and what an amazing surprise it turned out to be. The staff is incredible, cordial and very polite (everything you would expect from a 5-Star). The rooms are fantastic, quaint, and no two rooms are the same. The details made the difference for us. Little things like a personal note from the Hotel Manager and daily cards with the weather for the next day. A lot of hotels could learn about customer service from The Milestone Hotel. We would highly recommend the full tea service. Book it the day you arrive and prepare for the full experience. We cannot wait to return. "
August 2016,Felt like a valued guest,"We enjoyed our time in London in large part due to this hotel.  Their staff is incredible - from the doorman to the front desk to the concierge, the housekeeping staff, the breakfast greeters/servers - their people set them apart. It wasn't the least expensive hotel but the rooms were spacious, their staff was professional, the location was fantastic - close to a metro stop, the tube, as well as one of those hop on/hop off bus stops. WIFI was great. When we were making arrangements to leave we asked that a cab be arranged to take us to the train station and it was important to us that it was one that took credit cards as we didn't want to have to exchange more currency for a simple cab ride.  The bellman got us the cab, told us they accepted credit cards, got us in the cab and…"
June 2016,"Feeling ""at home"" in London","The Milestone Hotel is perfect in every respect if you are looking for a small hotel with an ""at home"" feeling in central London.  All the staff, without exception, were warm, welcoming, polite, respectful and helpful.  My room was beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean.  Breakfast was, without doubt, the best I have ever had in any country in the world.   In addition to the standard full English breakfast, there was a glorious selection of other breakfast fare available in an adjacent room.   It is close to shops, parks, restaurants, museums and The Albert Hall."
July 2016,"Our ""new"" number one choice in London!","Having stayed at The Savoy, The Dorchester, and lovely private homes in Holland Park, we now choose The Milestone as ""the place to stay"" when visiting London.  We have rarely experienced customer service and attention to detail like we did at The Milestone.  The location is perfect, the staff friendly and knowledgable, and the rooms simply beautiful.  Make sure you take some time to enjoy the bar, whether it's for tea or something stronger, as the people are friendly and the atmosphere just wonderful!  "
September 2016,A True Delight,"A perfect location with exemplary service. From Fabrizio at breakfast to Andrea at the concierge desk to Marco at the bar, everyday was perfection. We felt so welcome, had a fabulous time and can't wait to come back."
May 2016,"Lovely, but overpriced?","I loved the Milestone and the staff were faultless, but we booked two rooms thinking we would have a view of Kensington Palace but instead, had a brick wall view. For AU$550+ a night (without breakfast) it was a bit rich. Although the hotel was lovely (smallish room at our entry level price) and the staff were delightful, I would stay elsewhere next time as it was pushing $1.5-2k a night for the Palace and Park outlook."
August 2016,A wonderful anniversary stay,"We stayed at the Milestone for our anniversary. It was a beautiful and well run hotel with a staff that can not do enough for you. The rooms were beautiful and so clean. We were upgraded to a two floor suite overlooking Kensington Park. And when we returned to our room, the night of our anniversary, there were petals everywhere. Thank you Andrew Pike for a well run hotel."
July 2016,Beautiful Hotel in Great Location,"This beautiful boutique hotel is small and quiet and perfectly located close to good restaurants, high-end shopping, and a tube stop.  The rooms are small, but luxuriously decorated and furnished with every amenity.  In addition, the showers were wonderful and the beds were marvelously comfortable!  We were there for five nights and the staff was so helpful and attentive -- assisting us with tickets, arranging rides to and from the airport, and recommending restaurants.  My first choice in London!"
August 2016,Very British,This is an excellent property.  The staff is impeccable.  Service is outstanding.  The room was very comfortable.  The hotel is in an excellent location near the south west corner of Hyde/Kensington Park.  There is good access to transportation and many dining options that varied from fast food to fine dining.  This is an older/classic building that is in outstanding condition.  The breakfast was delicious.  A bit pricey but the quality was delivered.  We arrived after check in time and our room was not ready.  The front desk provided a very nice room for us to rest and refresh after our long transatlantic flight.  When our room was ready our things were transferred.  This was handled in a most professional way.  You will find a very well trained professional staff.
August 2016,Mrs kitchener,"We booked in on the 26th of August 2016 for our 10th year anniversary I must it was a very wonderful, posh and classy experience we were upgraded to Tudor room very posh and sophisticated, decorated with roses and petals, a welcoming complimentary champagne. Buffet breakfast in the room, the hotel very clean truly a five star experience, I would recommend this hotel 100 percent and I can't wait to go back there."
January 2016,Special hotel,"I recently stayed at the Milestone and experienced on of my best ever stays at a hotel, From the Moment we walked in we were welcomed by the doorman, check in was as quick as possible and we were treated like royalty. The rates at the moment were fantastic, The company recently launched a website offeringl rates for their London Hotels"
August 2016,World class- best staff ever,"Outstanding facilities- top quality staff - Jose the concierge was the best- helped arrive two unique tours. Doorman Thornet walked my wife to and back from the pharmacy. Their restaurant for dinner was outstanding- decor, quality and presentation of food. "
June 2016,Amazing Hotel --Great attention to detail and great staff,"This is singularly the best small hotel in London. Exquisite attention to detail, wonderful staff  who are constantly attentive to their guests' needs, lovely breakfast and afternoon tea. Sophisticated, warm, beautiful rooms. I have stayed at most of the finer hotels in London including the Dorchester and Ritz and this is a better stay and better price. The location-virtually across the street from Kensington Palace--couldn't be better as well."
March 2016,A little bit special,"We stayed here in March for my birthday and I was greeted with a personalised chocolate cake in my room - a fine start to a wonderful stay. Nothing is too much trouble and attention to detail is second to none, although our turn down service was missed on one evening and we also had a very rude awakening with a fire alarm very early one morning (fortunately a false alarm). I can find no fault with the food whatsoever, breakfast, afternoon tea, a very special evening meal - the only problem is deciding what to have. I look forward to staying again."
August 2016,Perfect boutique hotel in the perfect location,"A friend and I stayed at The Milestone for 5 nights and loved every minute of it. The hotel itself is small but our room was good sized with a lovely bathroom. We felt extremely welcome from the start of our stay with most of the staff addressing us by our names from the first day forward. Special service included opening the dining room quite early for a truly fabulous pre-theater dinner. Virtually right across from Kensington Palace and within easy walking distances to pubs, restaurants and shopping, this will be my go to hotel in London from now on!"
August 2016,"Outstanding service, meticulously clean, comfortable, lovely rooms; terrific location","The Milestone Hotel staff is 100% committed to making your stay the best it can be. The location is across the street from Hyde Park (beautiful walking and biking!) and, further down the street towards the Tube, there are good restaurants and shopping.  The traditional decor is inviting, very comfortable, and meticulously cleaned.  My daughter has allergies and I always check floor moldings, tops of picture frames, etc. and The Milestone room was dust-free and gleaming.Our room was on the courtyard and completely quiet (a delightful surprise in an urban venue!).  The toiletries, towels and other amenties are truly first class. Finally, saving the best for last, I cannot say enough wonderful words about the staff, especially Ronald, who greeted us on arrival, and Stevie, the Head…"
August 2015,Great hotel even better staff!,I had the pleasure of staying here for 6 nights during my stay in London and each one of them was memorable.  The doorman Steve was the best!  He was able to help with many facets of the trip from recommending off the beaten path pubs to try for lunch to ensuring I had an appointment at G F Trumper for a shave.  I will definitely be staying here for my next trip to London.
June 2016,"Warmth, Elegance, Lovely Location","Our travel agent suggested this hotel.  What a great suggestion!  We arrived in the morning before the room was ready.  We were offered an upgrade (nice surprise) and directed to the sitting room with comfy couches, tea and breakfast items.  I had been prepared to be grouchy after the overnight flight - but was so pleased with the treatment that I could only be pleased!   The rooms are lovely, the dinner in the restaurant was great, and the staff - from the doorman to the concierge to the front desk ... all were attentive, helpful, and professional."
July 2016,Very  friendly and nice,We just got back from a trip celebrating my wife's birthday and after reading the great reviews that this hotel had I decided to change our reservation  from a different hotel that we have booked .  we were definitely very impressed and happy  friendly atmosphere and great staff .  Location was great  July 2016
June 2016,Luxury place,"Ultra luxury hotel, the staff are amazing and the view great. for the price you get more than you would expect .Our room overlooking the pool was a good fit for us. Minimal sound comes into the room from outside. They have an evening lounge that opens in that area til about 2am. Kindly recommendation"
July 2016,Fabulous family-friendly stay,"I spent two glorious nights at the Milestone with my two boys and cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. From the unexpected upgrade to a larger room, to delicious treats for the boys, from the booking of a lovely sitter for our boys to games and water each time we walked out the door to scooter in Kensington Gardens, their staff was fabulous, responsive and so welcoming. The hotel is beautiful as well as extremely comfortable. We were made to feel as if it was our home in London and what a location directly across from Kensington Gardens! A perfect spot for families. We cannot wait for our next trip to London and our stay at The Milestone! "
July 2016,Lovely,"The Reason We picked this hotel was the location and the reviews, so because of this are expectations were high. We arrived and checked in no issues, we were shown to our room and it was lovely but a little cramped. We unpacked then thought we'd take a nap. The stains on the bed base and headboard were questionable. I felt unhappy as I was disappointed. My husband went and quietly spoke to manager and he came to the room to look. He immediately himself was shocked and stated that this had been overlooked and moved us immediately to a junior suite! The door man and concierge moved all our belongings so we didn't have to do it. The guest recovery was immediate and exceptional. Breakfast was amazing and a treat every morning. Our friends arrived the day after and loved it to. The…"
July 2016,"Negvesky, MD","The Milestone is hands down, one of the finest hotels in entire UK.  The hotel exudes British tradition and elegance--exactly how I wanted my US based family to experience true British culture.  The staff at this boutique hotel are brilliant--- geniuses in hospitality.   Shortened our stay at the Royal Crescent in Bath, when our oldest daughter developed a respiratory illness. We rushed back to Milestone, where they had arranged a first class Private Physician to examine my daughter on our arrival to the hotel in our own room.  We were out of our country and really needed guidance and immediate help, although we were in Bath, the Milestone Managment was the first placed we turned and trusted in an emergency situation----it was a blessing to have the amazing staff of a hotel take…"
June 2016,A Great Hotel Experience,"The Milestone is a wonderful boutique hotel across from Hyde Park.  We were greeted warmly at the car and again by the front desk.  All of the staff are helpful and very nice.  Everyone seemed to genuinely care that we had a remarkable stay. The hotel is beautiful and fascinating.  There is every modern convenience in the setting of an elegant, sort of art deco hotel.  Our room was spacious (Jr. suite), with a balcony and a glorious bathroom!  I highly recommend this location and hotel."
July 2016,Best Hotel in London,"I cannot express in words how magnificent our short stay was at The MIlestone hotel in London.  It was truly the best three days of our two week European vacation.  The individual attention to detail by every single member of their staff is incredible! From the welcoming gifts, to the attention we received on our late arrival at 2am, the daily room service and wonderful breakfast, the delicious surprise birthday cake delivered when we were experiencing afternoon tea at the hotel and my complimentary bottle of birthday champagne, to the concierge desk sending up Pokemon cupcakes to my daughters’ room after discussing the new Pokemon Go app around the city earlier in the morning.  We always felt like we were the only the guests in the hotel despite the other guests around us. …"
July 2016,Amazing stay at the Milestone,"Great service, amazing staff, and great location made for an amazing stay.  Would completely recommend the Milestone for a romantic weekend or ideal location to see the parks and sites of the west side of London."
August 2016,Lovely!!!, I have stayed at many hotels in most continents. This place holds a special place in my heart. Last time I was here I was away from home on a super sad trip during Christmas  and the genuine attention I received  from the staff was outstanding  and went way beyond my expectations. Not only did they go above in beyond in what I expect from a hotel but they took it to a whole level by treating me with genuine decency during a very emotional time for me. I can't say enough good things about this place.
July 2016,"Loved this hotel, did not want to leave",We spent 3 nights at the wonderful Milestone.  The staff here is the best!  They treated us so well!  We were there during some of the hottest days of the year and they made me the best ice tea I have had in a long time.  They were so friendly and attentive.  We enjoyed visiting with them and they truly enjoyed visiting with us.  Breakfast was delicious and there was so much variety.  The room was beautiful and it was so nice to enjoy such a wonderful meal there.  The wait staff were friendly and personable and did a great job serving us.  The concierge was always willing to help and gave us suggestions for dinner and made reservations for us.  The doorman always greeted us.  We can not say enough good things about this hotel or the many people that work there! We are so glad we…
July 2016,The excellent Milestone Hotel,"I have stayed in five star hotels throughout the world, and the Milestone Hotel was one of the best I have experienced! It was luxurious,elegant,  comfortable, and the staff tried to anticipate every need. The concierge was especially knowledgeable and helpful, and the food was also excellent. I highly recommend the Milestone Hotel to anyone traveling to the London area."
June 2016,The ultimate British hospitality,"For travelers who wish to experience a real authentic British experience that you read about in story books, the Milestone hotels delivers it big time.  From traditional breakfast and tea, this gem has it all.  It is not a big grand cookie-cutter hotel with a massive lobby full of tourists but a nice boutique property that's a home away from home. Service is outstanding and décor grand with all the modern amenities, wifi, etc."
July 2016,London Break,"We have been staying at this hotel for years averaging better than one stay per year - the Milestone has never failed to deliver outstanding value. For those looking for a small, intimate, boutique-type hotel that feels more like ""home"" than a hotel, that is well situated for restaurants and the ""Tube"" and with excellent service, this is the place for you.   Much of the staff is long term and they know how to deliver great service. The bar and restaurant are both excellent. Though the address lists Kensington Court, the hotel is actually located on bustling Kensington High Street right across the street from the entrance to Kensington Gardens - so very quite. Walk a 100 yards on the streets leading behind the hotel and it's like entering another world: residential, quite,…"
June 2016,Majestic milestone,"The red carnation group headed by  bea tollman is renowned for its luxury ,attention to detail and ordinal guest relations . Having frequented their 12 apostles in Cape Town  and oyster box / Umhlanga and the Rubens of London ! The milestone delivers !! The cuisine  and  high tea is impeccable . Location is amazing - opposite Kensington gardens - close to central London shopping and sights - well worth a stay !"
August 2016,Exceptional,"I would tell others not to bother with any other hotel in London, but then I would probably never be able to stay myself. We have stayed here a few times now, and quite frankly, it is the best hotel in London.  We ate out at the Dorchester on Saturday, I cant comment on the rooms, but the ambience has nothing compared to this hotel.  It is such a treat to stay here, the staff are superb, attentive without being intrusive, and willing to go the extra mile.  We ordered room service after being at Lord's all day. Not wanting a full meal, just something light, I would be reluctant to do this anywhere else, but at the Milestone, the menu on room service is superb. To top it all we had a fabulous room, a piece of tranquillity in the middle of busy London. My advice, don't bother with…"
June 2016,Summer holiday in London,"We have stayed at large 5-star and other boutique hotels around the world and have to say the Milestone and Red Carnation brand's dedication to service and comfort are among the best.  There we three of us on the trip, my wife and I and our 18 year old son.  We were celebrating his graduation and her birthday.  Every element of our stay was perfect beginning with the car service that picked us up to the butler and concierge teams to the hotel room staff.  We stayed in a junior suite and used a european roll-a-way which was a bed next to our master for our son.  The room was very spacious and we weren't tripping over each other.  The room's appointments were fantastic, quiet and absolutely stunning.  We made plans for Wimbledon, the changing of the guard, and other key sites…"
July 2016,Our new 'favourite London hotel!',"An unexpected treat, selected purely on this occasion, for proximity to The Albert Hall. A hotel where nothing is too much trouble. Small but not lacking in character or service.The staff are helpful, friendly and approachable. Our Guest Room, comfortable, quiet, extremely well appointed and spacious - by London standards. Our only grievance was the lack of tea making facilities in the room. Once mentioned, they promised to supply one on our next visit. Unfortunately only one night's stay on this trip, but it certainly won't be our last. This is one of the very few hotels at which we felt as relaxed and comfortable as we do at home."
July 2016,A delightful High Tea ,"Enjoying high tea at the restaurant was one of the high points of our visit to London!  This traditional experiences in a very classy setting is well worth the price. All the food was delicious and the service very friendly. The sandwitches, cakes and scones left us well satisfied.  "
July 2016,This is the best small luxury hotel in the world ,"I have to travel for work all over the world so over the years I have been to some pretty fabulous hotels. But none match the Milestone.   I had my wedding here a few years ago and yesterday I hosted a party for 40 guests for my Mum. Everything was faultless and perfect. The food, staff, service, room and organisation was so good that it meant that I could relax and enjoy the special afternoon. The staff at this hotel seem to really care about what they do, and they care about their guests too. Nothing is too much.   In particular Grant Cockburn, food and beverage manager, and David and Augustine deserve special mentions. Grant was simply wonderful and actually he helped make my Mum's reception really special. I cannot thank the Milestone team enough. This is a very special…"
June 2016,Delightful,"We stayed here 4 nights in early June. My wife and I both thought this was our best trip to London, ever, and we credit our stay at the Milestone for our epic enjoyment of the city. I used to think that in places like London the hotel doesn't matter. That what's outside the hotel is all that matters. But London is such a large and busy city. It not only has a lot to give, but takes a lot out of you as well - energy, physical activity, brain activity, emotional activity, etc. Because this hotel is located across the street from Kensington Gardens, the gardens are basically your backyard and you can enjoy strolls along and in it at any time. it's a nice break from the plays, museums, monuments, and shopping. And the hotel itself is a bastion of respite, hospitality at it's best,…"
July 2016,How do they recruit such remarkable staff?,Just returned from this hotel. Didn't want to leave. All the team made you feel like a regular guest. As a first time visitor with a dog in tow we could not believe the warmth of the welcome. Chloe checked us in. Pedro showed us around. Benjamin served our dog friendly supper in the stylish conservatory. David served our afternoon tea which was superb. Marvin helped with umbrellas and bag storing. Leo checked us out.  We had a lovely chatty lady who brought us breakfast in the room.  Everything in the room worked beautifully. Even the Sky TV remote was in a sterilized bag! The hotel's attention to detail is meticulous but it was so casual and friendly that Nero was encouraged to sit on the sofa. Thank you to everyone who helped our stay along. Apologies if we missed you by name.…
June 2016,A brilliant hotel in a perfect location that feels like home,"We stayed in the 'Rooftops' apartment - Apartment 6. This is the only one that is effectively three bedroom, with the third bedroom being a lovely little loft room.   This apartment also has an excellent roof terrace that, like the rest of the apartment, is isolated from the noise of the main road and feels like a sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of London.  The staff are excellent, nothing is too much trouble.  Its an old building, meaning the rooms are smaller, the place has age (in a good way). We came to London to feel the history of the place, and this hotel lets you live within that history, in the nicest sense.  We've tried their great afternoon tea (do *not* eat lunch beforehand) and enjoyed their lovely breakfasts.  But it really is about location (unbeatable -…"
June 2016,Great service at a great location,"Our recent stay at The Milestone was fantastic.  The service was top notch and left nothing to be desired.  We relied heavily on the entire staff, particularly the concierge and butler staffs, and were never disappointed with a recommendation.  And while not child- or family-focused, the staff at the hotel went above and beyond for our young children, making the stay much easier and more enjoyable on their parents.  We will certainly be back; it would be difficult to stay in another London hotel."
June 2016,Oh what a hotel! Would love to come back whenever in London,we stayed in Apt. # 4 which is one of the better among their 6 apartments. The apartment was ready before time(they said 6pm but it was ready at 2 when we reached) No request was too much for them. Our continental breakfast was included but they made it a full breakfast. The concierge was wonderful and extremely helpful. Service was excellent. Truly we were pampered.
June 2016,The best hotel!,I can't say enough wonderful things about this hotel.  My parents and daughters and I  stayed at the Milestone Hotel this month and enjoyed every minute.  We ate breakfast at the hotel every day and also ate 2 dinners at the hotel and the food was fantastic.  We also had afternoon tea which was also delicious.  The hotel itself is small but I think that lends itself to letting the staff personalize your stay.  They were welcoming every day when we returned from sightseeing and even surprised us one late afternoon with a delivery of homemade scones to our room.  The staff is so friendly and helpful and can't do enough to make sure that your stay is comfortable.  You can tell that they all love what they do.  The location was convenient to the tube stop and within walking distance…
May 2016,Birthday Decadence,"My husband and I recently travelled to England and Scotland for our 60 birthday celebration.  Staying at the Milestone Hotel was a most fabulous way to celebrate and visit London!  The entire staff was attentive to our every need or question, the food was wonderful and our suite was beyond expectation - nothing was left unattended.  The location by Kensington Place and the beautiful park puts it in quite a wonderful location - close by not too close to everything we wanted to see and do.  Nightly little surprises on our bed, beautiful white monogrammed towels and a comfortable bed made our stay at the Milestone one we won't soon forget!"
June 2016,Excellent Wedding Lunch & Accommodation ,"We decided to have our wedding lunch and spend our wedding night at this hotel after considering many offers in London.  And it was the Best Decision Ever 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉  Many thanks to: Florinda, Ben, Leo & Magda for making such special day even more special."
June 2016,"5 stars, but bring your wallet!","Set literally across the street from Kensington palace and the park, the hotel has impeccable service as one would expect at this level. Now, you are in a major Capitol city, and prices and room size reflects that. But the rooms are lovely, the bath was up-to-date and you have the usual perks. 24 hour concierge, 24 hour room service, restaurant on site, along with a small bar, free wifi, cable TV, complimentary coffee or tea wake up service, and a very helpful and accommodating staff. We did not eat there except for a light breakfast on arrival (excellent) and some room service soup (not good). There are many eating options within walking distance as well as a Whole Foods that has not only a hot food bar, but several restaurants above. We had breakfast and several bowls of soup…"
August 2016,"Lovely historical mansion, perfectly located near parks and  many points of interest","The Milestone Hotel  has wonderful and helpful staff who did everything to make our stay in London carefree and fun. Our room was simply  beautiful and reminiscent of ""Downton Abbey"" elegance, hospitality and service - sans pretention!   The  restaurant meals were delicious and the daily marvelous continental breakfasts were included at no extra cost.  Truly  the best hotel experience I  have ever had."
October 2016,Another Red Carnation group triumph,"We are slowly adding to our Red Carnation group London stays.  The latest was the Milestone Hotel in Kensington.  The welcome was friendly and efficient.  Our room was beautifully furnished with little treats set out for us.  We had a view over Hyde Park, a superbly comfortable bed and a sumptuous bathroom.  Breakfast in bed was a special treat and my Eggs Benedict were outstandingly delicious.  Little touches like having freshly squeezed grapefruit juice give this hotel its well-deserved reputation.  Comfort and service and a light touch of gentility- thank you!"
June 2016,WOW! A lovely high end hotel!,We came for our anniversary and we let them know ahead of time. They were fabulous and upgraded us. The rooms have so much character you feel like home.  If my home was professionally decorated of course! ;) They gave us a tour and told us some interesting history about the building... ask if you dare! We used our chase points to spoil ourselves and spoiled we were! the breakfast was lovely and full of choices. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!
September 2016,Wonderful experience!,"The Milestone is simply a gem. The rooms are beautifully appointed and spotlessly clean.  The small details are delightful.  For example, instead of the usual generic piece of bedtime chocolate, we found a different, beautifully packaged treat every night.  As well, there was always a live red carnation in our bathroom and a small orchid arrangement in our bedroom. The turndown service is exceptional, with fresh towels twice a day if one wants.  The staff is extremely welcoming, professional and eager to help with the smallest request.   The afternoon tea rivals any we've had at Brown's or the Connaught.  The tea room is  small but frankly, the calm and peaceful ambiance was welcome. The food offerings are generous and delicious. I highly recommend the Milestone to anyone who…"
September 2016,Best service and experience ever!,"My husband and I stayed at the Milestone during our honeymoon in London in September for a week, and absolutely loved it! We still talk about how the Milestone had hands down the best service we have ever experienced at a hotel! As part of our trip, we had the chance to take afternoon tea at the hotel, and it was absolutely delicious. Our flight was delayed, and the hotel staff (thank you Ms. Belinda Brett!) who we were coordinating with over email was kind enough to work with the afternoon tea staff for us to take our afternoon tea in between seatings so that we could make our evening plans. In addition to the tea, we also had dinner one night (delicious!) and an English breakfast every morning (seriously amazing with the choices) at the hotel. We discovered that the rice…"
September 2016,Exceeded all expectations,"We've been all over the globe and never really review hotels. This is different. The Milestone is by far the best hotel we've ever seen. Unbelievable personal service, well appointed room, and valuable amenities provided by booking though a Virtuoso agent. The value was very good, having pre-paid. I had told them it was my wife's birthday and they surprised her with a cake after dinner and scattered rose petals in the room for when we returned. The restaurant is first class, genuinely British and the breakfast (Included in the Virtuoso booking) was superb. Prime location on Kensington High Street 3 blocks from subway shopping and across the street from Kensington Gardens where you can jog or rent bikes. The only thing I can't understand is why it is only rated the #2 best small…"
September 2016,"Jackson ""What true hospitality and kindness means""",I recently had the great pleasure of staying at The Milestone Hotel from the minute we walked in the staff was ready and willing to help.I was in need of a gym during my stay the Personal concierge working with me went above and beyond in helping by finding 3 local gyms.The Milestone and it's staff are highly recommended for anyone looking for great service & accommodations.
August 2016,The Best In London,"My wife and I celebrated our Silver wedding anniversary by staying for 2 nights at The Milestone at the end of August. It was perfect. The friendliest staff you can hope for. Clea was delightful taking such good care of us and making us feel very special. She surprised us with a rose petal turn down while we were dining in Cheneston's. A lovely person! Dinner was excellent and Augustine was knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. We stayed in the African room. It was very clean, with quality furnishings in the bedroom and bathroom. Lots of character. Breakfast was great with a big choice available. Thanks also to other members of the team: Teddy, Mathieu and Patricio. They all made a big effort to get to know us by name and we quickly felt at ease with everyone. Finally, thanks to…"
September 2016,Number 1 boutique hotel,The Milestone dereves its rating as the number 1 boutique in London. Everything from the location to the quality of the staff and services is first class. This was our second visit and now we will not stay anywhere else. We were made to feel like returning friends.
September 2016,Great Location oppositie of Kensinngton park,"Great entrance with good conciërge service Personal service, good beds and locaties opposite of Kensington park !  Pool and fitness possibilities . One wheelchair room in ground Floor and pets are very Welcome . Special bar with horse details. "
July 2015,birthday treat,I stayed here with my son and his partner in the African room..excellent service ..i stayed in there room and had to have a put up bed which I didn't mind but I expected it more of a comfy one in standing with such a high hotel.We were going the ritz for afternoon tea but decided to take it at the milestone instead...excellent and we even got..a compliment for dressing up for the occasion.. ..Breakfast was fine except for bacon been over done well worth the treat
May 2016,"Amazing Service, beautiful accomodation and treated like Royalty","We arrived in time for Afternoon Tea (that was amazing) and things just got better and better. The rooms are each decorated differently and all very comfortable and roomy with mine having a view of Kensington Park. Even the trim around windows was historical and interesting, I loved the dragons!!   This is the place to be if you want personal service, accessibility and luxury. The staff make you feel very special any time of the night or day."
June 2016,Outstanding service!,"I stayed at The Milestone and once again received outstanding service particularly from Leo - Duty Manager, Jose - Head Concierge, Matthieu - Reception and the doormen.  The music in the bar was excellent!  Will be back to stay again very soon."
June 2016,"Live like a Queen, or a Princess, at the Milestone","Our stay at the Milestone Hotel in Kensington was superb.  I've never been treated like royalty before but they handled this in a most excellent way.  Everyone that works at the Milestone are the most personable and pleasant people I've met in my travels.  Every day as we ventured out we felt like we were leaving the family at home.  Coming home in the evenings after a day of beautiful weather and adventures, we were greeted by each and every one we passed.  How lovely a visit and we intend to return."
June 2016,Friendliest boutique hotel in London,"Absolute gem. Beautiful surroundings and the friendliest staff. We were in London for a family vacation, spending a week in London and a few days in Paris. The Milestone did not disappoint. The folks there really cared about providing the best experience for our large group. There were twelve of us staying in six rooms and each of us felt like we were royalty. From Andreas help in planning our excursions to Head Doorman Steve Thornett's unmatched knowledge of the local surroundings, you will not find a better place to stay in London."
May 2016,Absolutely fabulous wedding anniversary stay....,"This was our second w/e away since our daughter was born 14m ago. From the minute we arrived the staff were exceptionally friendly and welcoming. The reception staff were helpful and made sure we were aware of all local amenities. We were given a tour of the hotel after which we had a relaxing welcome glass of champagne at the bar. The ambiance of the entire hotel is friendly and relaxing. We were upgraded to a suit which was absolutely fabulous. The bed was extremely comfortable... So much so we returned for an afternoon nap! The turn down service was the best we'd ever experienced and we have travelled a lot. When we returned to our room that evening we were greeted with a handwritten card and an array of complimentary chocolates, strawberries and hot drinks.  Our stay was…"
June 2016,Fabulous stay!,"i was lucky enough for my husband to book a stay at The Milestone (and to see Swan Lake at The Albert Hall a 10 minute walk away) as a birthday gift. My husband knows that The Milestone has become my favourite hotel. It is indeed a beautiful hotel, but what makes this really special is not just the lovely rooms and personal touches, it is the staff. All of whom are efficient, friendly, helpful, courteous and utterly charming. Everyone went out of their way to ensure that we had a special time. We were so absolutely stunned by an upgrade to The Regency Suite, which was positively gorgeous and we felt even more special. Whatever room you choose at The Milestone you will not be disappointed with The Milestone experience. Thank you again to all the staff for making my birthday gift…"
June 2016,Just as Fabulous after two years!!!,"We recently re-visited The Milestone after a two year break, and to our delight every last detail was exactly as we had remembered, from the welcome at the front door, through lunch, dinner, breakfast and our reluctant departure at Reception the next morning! we regard the hotel as an absolute treat and very much look forward to our next visit."
May 2016,Personal service in the heart of London,"I stayed at the Milestone Hotel for three nights in May 2016. I did ask for every discount imaginable at the time of booking and when I arrived, I was given a free upgrade to a Studio Room. It was just lovely. The big difference between this hotel and the others I stayed at while in London was the personal attention in the Lobby from the concierge, the doorman and the reception desk. The staff were really helpful, giving me tips and directions every morning. The hotel is an old home converted and so it's a very English place. Wonderful experience."
June 2016,What a treat!!,"Amazing personal attentive service. Made us feel like royalty. The food was to die for and the room immaculate. No detail left untouched... Beautiful toiletries, gorgeous decor, could not have picked a better place for hubbies 50th Borthday treat"
June 2016,"High quality and fantastic location, but overpriced?","The Milestone is a very good hotel in all aspects: Excellent location, good service, and good standard throughout. However, good is not excellent. The hotel lacks the special touch and very attentive service level you would expect at a hotel of this standard. The price promises excellence, but the experience is not fully there. So what you eventually pay for is good comfort and quality at a fantastic location - close to everything in London."
July 2016,Simply the BEST!!,We stayed at the Milestone for six nights and LOVED it!  The service was exceptional from our very first contact prior to our stay until the second we walked out the door.  Everyone at the Milestone went above and beyond to assure our satisfaction!   Great location right across the street from Kensington Palace and Hyde Park.  We had an absolutely wonderful experience and a great time!
July 2016,incredible,This is overall the best hotel stay. absolutely impeccable!!! It was the first tim that I stayed in this hotel. I hope to come back very soon in London to stay another time in this place. Good job guys!
July 2016,Attentive service ,"We stayed at the Milestone over a weekend, from Friday to Monday. The customer service is really on the ball and they allowed us to check in early, which was great after an early flight. Dinner in the restaurant was excellent and the service in the bar is really professional. The room was a little disappointing though, stains on the walls where the air con is and all of the furniture was getting tired. It also had a dull drone from the lift ( although not bad enough to lose sleep but ask for a room away from the lift) and the faint aroma of old cigarette smoke. Also, no power point in the bathroom, aside from the usual shaving socket which was a little annoying.... Still, given the excellent service, most of this can be forgiven and the hotel is one of the better places I have…"
July 2016,Great stay in London!!!!,Overall the best hotel stay. The staff welcomed us HOME everytime we returned.  The housekeeping staff picked up and replaced towel twice daily what a dream. Jose got us GREAT theatre tickets and made a wonderful resturant pick for Indian food. I would highly recommend and what a great location.
July 2016,Impeccable!,"My wife and I stayed at The Milestone for one night, partly to celebrate a wedding anniversary. The hotel was faultless. Every single member of staff was genuinely friendly and entirely professional. The room was perfect, as were all the little, unexpected touches, such as a chocolate cake to celebrate our anniversary; the mini books (abridged Shakespeare and Dickens) placed on our pillows at night; and even the card placed by our bed showing tomorrow's weather forecast.   Whilst this hotel is not cheap, there is no question that you get what you pay for here. The customer service was the best I had ever experienced at any hotel. We were immediately made to feel welcome and comfortable. We were treated as valued guests.   In short, this hotel is outstanding!"
July 2016,A Crown Jewel!,"This is a very special hotel with a great staff that makes everything possible. It has the dark wood inside and traditional decor which i was not sure about at first,  but loved it within a day. The staff is soooooo amazing!!! The front desk, Chloe is fantastic, the concierge and the bellmen, the kitchen(24 hours!) laundry service--all superb. They were excellent with my kids picky menu desires and made it happen. What a total pleasure!!! Thank you from my heart!!!"
December 2015,Quintessentially British,Perfect location across from Hyde Park in South Kensington. The Milestone is a boutique hotel with beautiful rooms and attentive staff. The back area bar was perfect for drinks or tea. Room service was available (even their late night menu after hours). Their Holiday decorations around Christmas are stunning. Have stayed here multiple times and would definitely go back.
July 2016,Fabulous Luxury Hotel,"Stayed here as attending a concert in Hyde Park, so an excellent location. Received complimentary drinks on arrival. Staff were really nice and helpful, and friendly, which you sometimes don't experience in a hotel of this standard. Rooms were first class. I unfortunately left my room in a hurry and left it untidy. When I returned everything had been tidied up. Luxury toiletries and slippers are also provided. We booked afternoon tea which was of a very high standard and included champagne. The waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the tea, sandwiches and cakes. We also had breakfast the following morning which again was first class and the selection included everything you could possibly want. This is a five star hotel so would not be affordable for everyone but it…"
July 2016,"Wonderful stay, just perfect!","I researched for hours before booking a hotel in London & was extremely satisfied with my choice. We stayed here for a week & the location is excellent. You can see all of the sites within a few tube or bus stops and then return to the tranquility of the Kensington Park area. Next, the staff went beyond to make our first trip to London an amazing experience for my daughter & I. The breakfast & afternoon tea were delicious and once again the staff of servers were so accommodating, they couldn't do enough for us. The staff took a genuine interest, particularly Clea & Chloe, in making sure every part of our stay was amazing. Clea even went so far as to writing my teenage daughter a beautiful card & leaving tennis decorated cupcakes in our room on the night we returned from…"
August 2016,Amazing Hotel,The Milestone is on top its game credit to management and there team warm friendly service always time for us like a home away from home Will stay here again when in London with great bus service just outside the hotel Highly recommend
August 2016,Great experienced,Hello! Visit this and have a great experienced. The staff here is the best! They treated us so well! We were there during some of the hottest days of the year and they made me the best ice tea I have had in a long time. They were so friendly and attentive. We enjoyed visiting with them and and they're all good service. Highly recommend.
August 2016,Pleased we booked it,"We enjoyed our stay at the Milestone Hotel, very convenient for visiting family in Kensington, the room was immaculate, we only had breakfast in the hotel during our stay, the service was attentive and the food was top notch. We will use this hotel as a base again."
August 2016,Most memorable stay on our honeymoon!,"From the moment we entered the Milestone, it was obvious that customer service was a main focus. The entire staff outdid themselves on making sure our honeymoon stay with them was something we would never forget! The only disappointment was that we didn't get to spend more time there. We can't wait to travel back to London and spend more time with the amazing staff at The Milestone hotel!"
August 2016,Great service with attention to detail,From the moment of Rrival the staff made us feel right at home.   The bedrooms and hotel are both beautifully appointed.  Wifi service works without a glitch.   The high marks for the trip however goes to the concierge staff.   They helped us plan our day-to-day activities and continued to plan for us even while we were gone for the day.  The location is great and only waking distance from the Kensington palace and one block from the public transit station. We highly recommend this hotel and look forward to coming back on a future trip.
July 2016,Outstanding Service,We were staying at the Milestone for the first time as we joined friends who are regular guests. The hotel was elegant and our room - up in the roof was both charming and comfortable. The breakfasts were excellent and set us up for the day - which means I cannot tell you about either lunch or dinner at the Milestone. We did however enjoy bar food and drinks in the evening and found the conservatory a very civilised place to watch the Euro final. What really sets this hotel apart however is the staff. Everyone goes out of their way to help and assist. They are all delightful and are the secret to this hotel's overall charm. We will definitely coming back as soon as we can.
August 2016,Wonderful service and good location,"The Milestone prides itself on customer service, and did not disappoint. All the staff were very helpful, and worked to accommodate special requests. The food was good (we only had tea and breakfast, not dinner). One odd thing was that our room (#104) had no place to unpack small clothing - no chest of drawers, and only one small shelf in the closet. We had been looking forward to not living out of our suitcases for our 3 night stay, but unfortunately couldn't do that. I don't know if the other rooms have drawers or shelves, but perhaps they could fix it because it seemed odd for such an upscale hotel."
August 2016,Sorry to leave...and plan to return ,"The Milestone was recommended by our travel agent, who assured us that this would be a nice hotel in a good location.    The hotel proved to be much more.   We were immediately given a tour of the facility by Clea who was extremely personable, and a rush was put on getting our room ready, as we arrived a couple of hours before standard check-in time.    Our rooms were not large, but not cramped, which is all we expect from a hotel in a crowded city such as London or NYC.   Everything was in working order, and turndown service with a delicious late night snack was provided daily.  Breakfast was included and delicious each morning.    The concierges, especially Andrea, were phenomenal.  They were knowledgable and would help with anything needed.  We called Andrea for a private…"
August 2016,"""We are your home away from home.""","The title of this review is a direct quote from the desk person who checked us in.  He wasn't kidding.  This is a luxury, 5-star, expensive hotel, so you expect it to be great.  It was MORE than great because the people were so nice, friendly and helpful. Sometimes high-end London hotels can be stuffy.  Not the Milestone!  The opposite was true and staff is obviously given the permission -- and time -- to converse with guests.  We stayed there twice (at beginning and end of a trip to England).  We had a wonderful room both times, upgraded to a junior suite both times because we booked through Virtuoso, which offers upgrade if available.  Our suites each time were totally different and both very comfortable with sumptuous baths (though I would have liked a shower separate from…"
April 2016,The Best Afternoon Tea in London!,"We stayed at this beautiful hotel last August for our wedding anniversary and enjoyed a superb Afternoon Tea, so when we visited London again for a show and overnight stay, we booked for another late afternoon Tea before we travelled back home.  As usual the staff were very friendly and accomodating and nothing is ever too much trouble! The sarnies, cakes and scones were splendid and they made me scones without currants/raisins which were presented warm with lovely cream and jam. We couldn't eat it all, so they kindly boxed them up and took them home to enjoy.  We are going to stay at their sister hotel in Dorset, Summer Lodge in August for this years anniversary and really looking forward to yet another Afternoon Tea there!  Fabulous hotel, excellent service and staff!! Keep up…"
May 2016,The best hotel ever!,"It was simply amazing. All staff were excellent and couldn't have been more helpful, our room was beautiful and comfortable. The milestone ensured we had fantastic stay. They did this by just doing little things that had a huge impact on our stay such as arrival drinks, or the tour or even just holding doors open for us. During the stay has made us itching to come back, it's definitely my favourite place in the world. Couldn't have asked for better service!! Thanks to all staff."
May 2016,Hotel Worthy of Its Five Stars,"This is the second time I've stayed at the Milestone Hotel. The location is excellent, directly across the street from Hyde Park and Kensington Palace.  This is a truly lovely, small hotel.  The whole staff, from doormen to desk to concierge to room service,  is outstanding - courteous, warm and welcoming.  The rooms are appointed beautifully, the beds and pillows are outstanding and the bathroom was roomy and up-to-date.  We ate in the hotel restaurant on our first night, and it was good, but not great.  Service was excellent; food was ok.  Other than that slight negative, I have nothing but raves for this hotel."
April 2016,The Milestone Experience!,"My wife and I booked a stay here to celebrate our wedding anniversary. From the the first moment we stepped across the threshold to the time for our checkout the service from all the staff was exceptional and flawless. Nothing was too much trouble. After returning to the hotel on the first evening, the staff had decorated our room with rose petals and provided champagne and strawberries to add the finishing touch to a memorable day. Breakfast the following morning was a multitude of choices but I would heartily recommend the full English . We had dinner in the restaurant on the second night and this was well presented and delicious. All in all I we would recommend this hotel for it's excellent location, very helpful staff , comfortable and chic bedrooms and communal areas. We…"
May 2016,Marvellous ,"Stayed here with family before a concert at the RAH.  This is a beautiful hotel with extremely courteous and attentive staff. The rooms were luxurious, superb cuisine and wine list in keeping with a 5*+ hotel and the ambience of the general areas was that of a historic private aristocratic London Town house. This hotel has real character and the staff genuinely want you to feel welcome, nothing is too much trouble, I left my concert tickets in the car after the hotel had parked it for me, only discovering my mistake close to show time, I think that the concierge ran all the way there and back to retrieve them for me.  Can't wait to stay here again and take more time to enjoy the facilities properly. "
May 2016,Home from home in heart of London,"So I booked through Lovetoescape and wasn't sure how it would be....fantastic! Superb Queen Deluxe room, a welcome glass of champagne in the bar, a bottle of champagne in the room too! Service was fab, exactly what you should expect in a boutique hotel. Close to the Albert Hall, Kings Road, and opposite Kensington Palace and gardens...5 mins to the nearest tube and oh yes, plenty of nearby shopping. Would absolutely stay again....everyone so friendly in the hotel....."
June 2016,In 40 years of travel to Europe I have found no better boutique hotel than London's Milestone.,"I cannot describe just how wonderful this hotel is. The staff are so friendly and welcoming treating as though you are a friend rather than a customer - and the service they provide is exceptional.  The room (Kensington Suite) was absolutely amazing - on split levels, beautiful decor & furnishings, overlooking the park & everything you could want for a very comfortable stay in London.  We had drinks in the bar (which used to be the stables) and sat in the conservatory, which was very pleasant.  In the evening we drank in the bar and this is cosy and comfortable.  The hotel is not huge like many of the hotels in London and the public rooms on the ground floor meander around so as you feel like you're in a home rather than a grand hotel. Breakfast was very good with a good choice…"
June 2016,Caring Staff with Thoughtful Amenities,"I can only imagine what the level of service must be directly across the famous Knightsbridge Road from the Milestone at Kensington Palace, the official residence of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. However I doubt it is better or friendlier than that at the Milestone. Rather than list superlatives let me just say that the ambiance, the rooms, and the restaurant are all 6 Star. In the forty years I have been visiting the UK I have never found a more comfortable, friendly, and luxurious hotel. The restaurant is outstanding I might. Those Americans who might be concerned about haughty or snooty behavior at such an elegant manse need not worry. Everyone is treatred equally regally. Absolutely the place to stay in London!"
May 2016,Wow! Now that's what I call service!,"Enjoyable one-night stay. Arrived after a long flight and the staff was helpful in getting us settled. Lots of small treats in the room (tea, cookies, etc.) and we appreciated the complimentary coffee with our wake-up call. Small but elaborately decorated room. Perhaps could use a little refreshing in some areas, but it's a historic hotel. Kensington area has a lot to offer and is closer to LHR than some other hotel options in the city."
January 2016,Always charming with superior service,Fantastic service all around. We felt like royalty and experienced firsthand the famed British hospitality. The whole place had a charming and cozy feel to it while staying elegant at the same time. The staff are a great asset to this hotel! Stayed for more than a few days and not once had I even the smallest complaint. Thumbs up to the management and staff!
April 2016,Can't wait to come back!,"We stayed in the apartments this April for the entire month. The apartments are attached to the Milestone and they have their own door in the foyer so that you can enter and exit without going through the lobby. We had groceries delivered several times while there. The hotel handled it perfectly. There was new staff this time with notable learning bumps (consistency with room service was an issue). The newer staff made minor variations to menu items. When you find something that's wonderful to eat, changing it isn't a good thing. Example - eggs benedict plate differed based on who took the order. Staff that had been there longer didn't have this issue. Everyone was friendly. There was one major issue with hot water in the apartment - we kept running out. With 4 adults showering,…"
June 2016,Amazing,"We booked the Milestone based on Trip Advisor reviews and it absolutely exceeded expectations!! The staff goes the extra mile every day to make the hotel a home away from home. The attention to detail is incredible, the breakfast outstanding, and the service personal and impeccable. We were so comfortable and well cared for that I cried when we left! For future trips to London we won't stay in any other hotel!"
August 2016,Amazing service and experience!,"I have stayed in the Milestone on numerous occasions and absolutely love it here. My hubby booked this as a surprise for my 60th before we flew to Dubai. If I had to go home after my stay here I would not have worried. We were very kindly given an upgrade to the lovely Safari suite. Sooo comfortable with the best bed ever. We had breakfast on both mornings. Excellent We ate here the 1st night and done the afternoon tea on the 2nd day both were delicious. Tasty canapés were served in the bar. Staff are fantastic and they truly make this hotel what it is, they really go the extra mile. Thank you to Steven on the door for you little chats and to Leo who gave us a tour of the hotel and then took us to our room. It truly is like a home from home and I could go on and on but just…"
May 2016,Perfect for the Albert Hall,"As we walked into the milestone we were given a tour of the hotel which was really good and interesting. We were then shown to our room and were offered welcome drinks and complementary biscuits made by the chef. The room was amazing and felt so luxurious, especially the bathroom! When we came back from our evening meal there was a cake left for me which shows that the hotel really cares about their guests. The breakfast was amazing! I had an English breakfast and my partner had eggs Benedict along with the continental breakfast. All the staff were so welcoming and made the stay amazing!   However, we did experience some difficulties with payment but I have gone to the bank to sort this out."
June 2016,Heavenly hotel,"Just five minutes from the Albert Hall, the Milestone Hotel is the perfect place to stay after a great show.  We stayed in the Safari Room with a view over the Park, service was friendly and attentive and we had an excellent meal in the hotel restaurant. There were a couple of nice touches, a free glass of champagne (Laurent Perrier) and a box of goodies in the room.  It was my wife's birthday and we were made to feel very special. "
April 2016,"Amazing, Life's Greatest Moments Experience","I chose the Milestone for its location.   Close to my business needs and Kensington Gardens, where I wanted to walk when I could.  I loved this hotel.  The staff was so warm and impeccably professional. I arrived late in the evening, and they offered me a glass of wine in my room, on the house.  How sweet! I never ate there, nor did their pricey (!) afternoon tea, but I enjoyed my stay immensely.  "
December 2015,A perfect weekend,"This review is long overdue - our family stayed at the Milestone over Christmas 2015 for 8 days and I cannot say enough about this hotel.   The staff was absolutely impeccable and felt like family.   The General Manager, Andrew Pike, was amazingly accommodating and gracious to ensure that our every need was attended.  His staff from Andrea, the concierge, to Chris, the Sommelier to the doormen, to the maids, to the front desk - they were all amazing.   This was our first Christmas away as a family and it could not have been more memorable.   They brought the children hand-wrapped gifts on Christmas eve and Christmas morning and even delivered fully loaded stockings for the kids at midnight!  Every meal that we had at the hotel was wonderful and every evening we spent sleeping in…"
April 2016,Another lovely stay,Really exceeds expectations everytime we stay. Nice and central so location works well for walkers too.  If you are new to London the staff are very helpful with useful information and concierge were fantastic at last minute tickets to Lion king. Thank you!
May 2016,"Fantastic Service, perfect location","What a charming hotel. From the numerous professional staff who seem to enjoy their jobs to the cozy room and luxurious bathroom, we loved our stay.  Each afternoon a fresh snack was delivered to our room.  The staff recommended a fantastic restaurant that was walking distance.  Speaking of walking, what's better than being right across the street from the park? Did I mention how quiet our room was? I look forward to my next visit."
February 2016,Weekend Away,"Had a fantastic time with my hubby, staff very polite and professional.  Whole hotel clean and cant wait to return later in the year. Food excellent and would recommend anyone to go and stay for a weekend"
May 2016,Fabulous stay!,"One night of luxury courtesy of the friendly staff and wonderful venue.   We stayed in the Jungle Room on the 4th floor with a great balcony. We booked through Secret Escapes but I would not have been upset at full price. At the price I paid it was great value!  I'd stay again anytime, thanks. "
May 2016,AMAZING! ,"I couldn't fault this hotel in anyway at all! The place is just breath taking, in all sense. From the minute you walk in the door you are greeted with a smile...   I went to celebrate my birthday and many other occasions along with my husband and the hotel did an amazing job at making it even more special! The room was just beautiful- I have never stayed anywhere that amazed me everytime I walked in the room.. I just couldn't believe how beautiful one place could be!  Thank you to all the staff at the hotel for being so friendly. It makes a place even better.  Jose on the concierge was nothing but helpful and picked a beautiful steakhouse for us to eat at on the Saturday! So thank you.  I can not wait to come back and stay again! It was just the most amazing weekend I have had…"
May 2016,Glorious afternoon tea,"Great traditional and old fashioned small hotel. Very warm welcome by dedicated staff (3 for 18 guests). Good presentation of the product, great selection of teas, champagne, cocktails etc. Fabulous surrounding. Delicious sandwiches, cakes and scones. Very good customer care throughout the experience. Pity for the limited bathroom facilities forcing to queue. Also, loads of service traffic through the main door and lounge."
May 2016,Wow Outstanding !!!!!!,"We had a night away from the children, to celebrate my friends special birthday.  From the moment we got to the hotel, the staff were amazing! We entered the room and my friend had been made a beautiful birthday cake and a personal birthday from Fran the butler.  The service,food and friendly staff was second to none!   We would highly recommend coming to the MIlestone, you will be treated like a VIP.  Thank you everyone for making our evening so very special."
May 2016,Lovely Place !!,"Really lovely place to stay, all staff we encounted were a pure pleasure, they could not do enough for us. The rooms are stunning and everything is in the right place, all the extras are of the best quality, I really wanted to stay longer. We were on a special deal which was fantastic, however the normal rates are probably a little out of our price range, so Thank you the Milestone team. Bryan & Susan Webb"
October 2015,simply the best,"Excellent location, confortable rooms, lovely atmosphere.   The Restaurant (Chenneston's) is high quality and gorgeous.  A remarkable afternoon tea which is offered in a very pleaseant lounge.  In a few words: Simply the Best!"
May 2016,A big birthday and the Dixie Chicks,"We recently spent a lovely weekend at the Milestone Hotel. It is sublime.  We arrived to a flurry of exceptional staff who took us to our room overlooking the park.  The rooms are luxurious. My husband was impressed with the amount of towels and the two different types of robe! Attention to detail is everywhere, from the biscuits to the monsoon shower head.  The quote of the weekend was ""everything is possible at the Milestone"" and that is true. If you ask lovely things happen. The husband struggled when ordering breakfast - eggs benedict or haddock. Have both says the waitress. And he did. Delicious.  One piece of advice is have the waffles. Heaven.  We will be back. And thank you to all at this gorgeous hotel. "
May 2016,"Pet Friendly, Welcoming 5* Hotel.","Have just returned from my second stay at the Milestone Hotel, what a treat.  The Milestone is a 5* hotel without the stuffiness that sometimes comes with that. Everyone was very welcoming and seemed genuinely pleased to see us. We initially picked the Milestone because it was a pet-friendly hotel and it certainly was. We travelled with our pet Labradoodle and there were no problems at all. The location is also great, just opposite Kensington Gardens. Highly recommended."
May 2016,Afternoon Tea,"A truly delightful experience. Our tea time was 3pm but we arrived early and shown into the lounge and made to feel very welcome. The whole experience was pure delight.  The service, the tea, the sandwiches, scones and cakes superb and surrounding perfect. Sitting in very comfortable, easy chairs it seemed a world away from the bustle outside in this park of Kensington. This is a small hotel but superb quality throughout and the staff so very friendly and welcoming and not stuffy as some five star hotels can be. Book afternoon tea here and experience this delightful English pleasure for yourself. You will not be disappointed."
June 2015,Absolutely perfect !,"The milestone hotel is in a class of its own . As soon as you walk into this hotel you feel at home , relaxed and welcome . The service in this hotel is 1st class all the staff very efficient and friendly . Our room was perfect and it faced the Kensington gardens we had an amazing view over the park . The bed was one of the comfiest I've ever slept in , the bathroom was stunning and the decor was immaculate. Everything about this hotel is perfect I would recommend it to anybody . Food is amazing , we had dinner , breakfast and afternoon tea while we were here and everything was sublime . Don't hesitate to book this hotel you will not be disappointed. Overall a 5 star hotel that is truely outstanding, my wife and I can't wait to return . "
May 2016,Peaceful with great servi,We stayed 4 nights wanting somewhere near the Albert Hall and Kensington. We had never before stayed at the Milestone but will return. The hotel is quiet with very attentive staff - after only a short while they all recognised us. The room was very comfortable and the bed was fantastic. We had continental breakfast each day which was extremely good and although we didn't eat dinner we did have a snack one evening in the Stables bar. Once again the food and service were very good indeed.   It's fair to say that we were not impressed by afternoon tea and mentioned it when we checked out. In very sharp contrast to most institutions the person doing the checkout took our comments on board and said they would follow up. The interesting thing is not only that they say they strive for…
March 2016,Truly memorable,I took my mother to stay at The Milestone for a birthday treat and from the moment we arrived everything was made so wonderful for us. This truly was a night she will never forget. The staff were the most pleasant and helpful people you could wish to meet. The surroundings were just pure luxury. Everything about our stay here was amazing. I would gladly go back whenever I got the chance and would recommend the place to everybody I meet. Thankyou to everyone at The Milestone for making our trip simply the best experience ever.
February 2016,"Small Luxury Hotel, Top of the Line Service","Great hotel, great location.  Like living in a large, traditional mansion.  Attentive staff to cater to every need.  Excellent restaurant and bar facilities.  We will always return to the Milestone on our London visits."
April 2016,The Lap of Luxury,"Our first stay at the Milestone Hotel 4/4-9/2016 was one of pure delight. Upon arrival a quick check-in was followed by a tour of the public rooms - bar, dining room, library and the conservatory where we grabbed a quick bit to eat and then off to our room.   Our room had a king size bed, small seating area and a full modern bathroom with tub and an a wonderful shower. Excellent towels and bathrobe/slippers were there for your comfort. Twice daily maid/turn down service made sure the room was always in perfect shape.  We included breakfast in our room reservation which I recommend since breakfast at London hotels can be unreasonably priced by American standards. Having it included allowed us to choice between dining in the our room or in the dining room. We chose 'in room…"
April 2016,Fabulous Hotel,"This hotel is great, it is in a fantastic location with really friendly staff who go out of their way to help you, nothing is too much trouble. Rooms are fab with everything you need, make sure you ask for Tea and Coffe in your room. Toiletries, robes, slippers all in the room for you to use along with complimentary bottled water. We got this hotel on Secret Escapes so got a good deal for B and B, would visit again if offer came up. Breakfast was good with choice of cereals, fruit, meats, cheeses, yoghurts and hot cooked choices. Would recommend this hotel to all."
March 2016,"Family of four, including 2 teenagers","This hotel is superb in every regard. The decor, the service, the amenities, the warmth and the taste of it all is exceptional. The rooms are lovely, as is the bar, restaurant and inviting lounge.?Truly a gem and across from Kensington Park and 5 minutes from beautiful Hyde Park. The staff is both friendly and professional. couldn't ask for a better place. Quiet and tasteful luxury. A great value as well."
April 2016,Stunning hotel in great location,"Excellent service , made to feel very welcome , room was lovely with great view of Kensington gardens. Welcome drink was added bonus and enjoyed our cocktails. The evening meal and breakfast were superb . Would live to stay here again when next in London . As husbands birthday we had champagne , strawberries dipped in chocolate and a lovely card waiting for us in our room. Location is ideal , 15 minute walk to Harrods and great local shops a couple of minutes away. We used the pool and sauna and both spotlessly clean as was the whole hotel .Have stayed in hotels in Kensington before and would say that The Milestone is the best ."
April 2016,Brilliant!,Partner took me here for my birthday. Great from start to finish staff polite and attentive. complimentary drink on arrival. big soft beds and sky tv in the room.  Really good personal service. would stop at this hotel again in a heartbeat.
February 2016,"Truly, our home in London","My wife and I are fortunate enough to get to London at least a couple of times a year.  We used to stay at a Kensington business hotel that while adequate, was never ""special"" for us. We'd walk by The Milestone on our way to the Kensington High Street tube station, and I'd say to my wife, ""Some day.""  On the next trip, half a dozen years ago,  my wife took me to tea at The Milestone, and that was the deal maker.  Our next visit was our ""some day,"" and from the moment we checked in, bleary-eyed from our overnight flight, to our departure four days later, The Milestone never disappointed.    From the warm greeting by Patricio or Stephen, the doormen who are now like family, to the always helpful and considerate front desk gang, to concierge Andrew's always helpful -- sometimes…"
April 2016,so friendly and helpful,"My wife and i stayed at the Milestone Hotel from the 5th to the 8th April 2016, Loved the hotel and all the staff were really friendly and could not do enough for us to make us feel welcome, we were offered an introductory tour of the hotel.  We stayed in the royal studio and it is the first hotel we have stayed in where the walls were completely covered in a material wall covering, the hotel is right opposite Kensington Palace and Gardens and a 10 minute walk to the nearest tube station."
June 2015,Fantastic Hotel,We stayed last year here and we had so much fun. The receptionists are helpful. They are so very cheerful. We love the breakfast. The room is clean. We would like to thank the housekeepers who cleaned the room daily.
April 2016,As good as ever ,"This is the second time we have stayed at the Milestone, the first in January.  Yet again our stay was perfect with added attention to detail for my partners birthday.  All the staff at this hotel are fantastic making you feel very at home without being over attentive.  We will continue to return and enjoy what feels like our London home. "
April 2016,"Nice, cosy and friendly",I loved my stay at the Milestone Hotel last week and I am coming back next week. The ambience is so nice and relaxing. The rooms are beautiful decorate. The service and the staff is flawless. It is so easy to feel at home here.
April 2016,Impeccable service and unique rooms,"Only one night here for a birthday celebration, but would return without hesitation.  The staff all provide truly excellent service.  You feel that nothing would be too much too ask, yet they are not intrusive in any way.  A birthday card appeared in the room after they heard we were celebrating a birthday, and that was whilst we were enjoying complimentary welcome drinks in the bar."
April 2016,Great Hotel and excellent service,Stayed here for long weekend break and what a great place it is. From the warm welcome and very helpful staff to the homely surroundings and comfortable room this is a great small hotel on the edge of Hyde Park. The food was excellent and the afternoon tea sublime. We look forward to planning a return visit to this gem of a hotel. 
April 2016,Can't stump these people!,"A great 5 star boutique hotel located opposite Kensington Palace & Gardens and just down the road from the Royal Albert Hall has a staff that cannot do enough for you!!!  We had booked a total of 3 rooms that had different lengths of stay.  The staff handled the room changes and other requests like it was nothing. This is the hotel's strongest asset.  The staff always there to help, but never feel intrusive.  This is a classic British hotel with dark wood paneling and padded walls.  We had king rooms overlooking Kensington gardens and couldn't hear the traffic right outside! If you are looking for traditional with that personal touch, look no further than the Milestone Hotel."
April 2016,My favourite hotel in London - amazing location,"The Milestone is perfect in all but one way, I was staying there on my own...!   The hotel is small and because of this very personal and exclusive, but The staff at Red Carnation manage to make you feel so welcome and at home and its so unstuffy and warm and welcoming   The setting and the hotel building and of course the decor all give you such a strong sense of place, and you will feel like you are in London. the location was perfect and I enjoyed the spring weather and walking in Kensington Park. So close to Royal Albert Hall and the museums as well as shopping on Kensington High Street.    I loved the food, ate the Wagyu beef with black truffle hollandaise and hand cut chips...  I will stay there again, this time with my partner... its my favourite hotel in London"
April 2016,Luxury and amazing customer service,Amazing comfort and luxury in a wonderful setting. Amazing customer service by excellent staff who should be commended for their outstanding hospitality. Our experience and enjoyment seemed to matter and nothing was too much trouble to ensure we have treasured memories of a memorable time at the Milestone. 
April 2016,Absolutely fantastic!,"I've stayed at The Ritz and The Savoy, but none of these compare to The Milestone Hotel in terms of service. We have had an absolutely wonderful stay from start to finish. The staff is friendly and always ready to help. The restaurant and bar employ only top professionals. You really can't go wrong. We even decided to stay an extra night. Although we had to switch rooms because of this the staff took care of everything for us, we only had to switch keycards and make sure everything was properly packed! We WILL be going back! The sooner the better!"
March 2016,Outstanding Hotel,We have just stayed at the Milestone for a second time and we cannot fault it.  Staff are extremely helpful and friendly.  Hotel is spotless and very comfortable.  Rooms are tastefully furnished.  Food superb.  We are both gluten free and they even supplied gluten free cookies in the room - so thoughtful.  Would not hesitate recommending this Hotel - well done the Milestone.
July 2015,Pure Opulence,My husband proposed to me at the Milestone Hotel. It came as a complete surprise. From start to finish the suite he booked and the service we received was excellent. We stayed in an African themed suite. The entire suite had candles and rose petals including in the bath tub. We had champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. Breakfast the next morning was delicious and served to us in our suite. Yes it is expensive and you pay for all these extras but it was worth it for a once in a life time occassion. I definitey recommend the Milestone for a special occassion.
July 2015,A Majestic Hostelry,"Absolutely oozing charm and refinement. Just a tiara's toss from Kensington Palace, home to Prince William and his wife Kate, the Milestone is an Edwardian home from home. Every room and suite has a different design, and Kensington High Street and Harrods are just a short walk away. A boutique hotel with great style!"
May 2016,Perfect!,"This was our second visit to The Milestone and  I hope it won't be our last. Every member of staff was welcoming,professional and committed to making our stay enjoyable. The room was gorgeous and the little extra touches such as the hand made biscuits made the experience extra special. The food was delicious and the complimentary canapés served with our drinks were great. We  highly recommend this hotel."
May 2016,The great reviews are true,"We were in the Mystinguette suite for 3 nights. The great reviews are true, this is a very elegant hotel with excellent hospitality. All the staff do a very good job making you feel at home. A special mention for Andrea, one of the conciërges, for excellent help arranging dinner and brunch at two different places.  We found the location fine, visiting the Tower, the Eye, Harrods and all sorts of sights in Chelsea and Knightsbridge. "
May 2016,4 Nights & 5 Stars!,"We enjoyed our 4 night stay in the Mistinguett suite to celebrate our anniversary before traveling onto Monte Carlo for another 4 nights at the Hotel Hermitage, a larger 5 star property.  We chose the Milestone for our time in London due to it's great location but mainly because of it's a smaller, boutique type hotel which was a great contrast to the Hermitage. After this trip,  we'll definitely be staying at more boutique type & Red Carnation properties.given our great experience at the Milestone.  Prior to arrival, we received an email requesting details like favorite colors, drinks, reason for visit, pillow menu, etc.  It's worth the time to fill this form out - the information was certainly put to good use by the staff.   Upon arrival we were greeted by the super friendly…"
May 2016,Classic old school English,"Always a wonderful stay. Boutique hotel, attentive and solicitous service, wonderful food and a welcoming staff. Better every time. Can't say enough about this very special place. The library is a great place for an after dinner drink. The hotel is located across the street from Kensington Park and Kensington Palace.  Beautiful place for a stroll. London Whole Foods is a block away. How convenient!"
April 2016,Beautiful tranquil boutique hotel,"We spent an amazing weekend at The Milestone to celebrate a very special birthday with friends from US. We were welcomed by Patricio on arrival and made to feel welcome by all the staff. We had a beautiful room on the third floor overlooking Kensington Palace and gardens. Every possible need was met,crisp Egyptian cotton sheets and goose down pillows,the bathroom was well equipped with Penhaligan toiletries and lots of thick white towels. We had complimentary champagne and a delicious lunch.Breakfast was a really an amazing affair,so much choice I cannot begin to list,but it appeared that anything was possible. It really was a wonderful experience,I cannot recommend this beautiful hotel enough! If you want luxury this is the place to stay"
May 2016,SUPERB!,"This old building beautifully preserved and enhanced whilst offering all the trappings of a first class international hotel. Walk into a 'home from home atmosphere' to be met by the most professional,  pleasant & helpful staff you could ever wish to meet! Wonderful dining in plush surroundings and overlooking Kensington Gardens with a 'back drop' of Kensington Palace. My photos don't show fully the splendour of this hotel. Any of my clients that stay here always find it a faultless experience! "
May 2016,Excellent Hotel,We had a wonderful time and the concierge took excellent care of us. Across from Kensington palace and the sunshine followed us from Florida.  Highly recommend this hotel. Cool bar and the room was very British.
April 2016,Most elegant high tea in london,Wonderful tea selection Divine tea sandwiches Delicious pastries Top notch service Kind to children Go every visit to London and go several times a year Grandchild's Christening party held here Respectful and interesting staff from several nations but all with good English
April 2016,Feels like home,"I loved staying there above all for all personnel tried to make me feel like home. I got upgraded upon arrival to deluxe king, room was serviced twice a day, it was bright and very comfy and cosy. Bed was huge and very comfortable. Location is perfect since tube is like 150m away and Kensington gardens is just across the street. Lot of restaurants and shops are near by. Wifi works perfectly which was important for my business."
March 2016,"A Lovely Hotel, with very professional and attentive staff!!","Mr Andrew Pike the general manager has a good marketable product on offer with this hotel, backed up by a very well groomed and professional team of people! We stayed here at the Milestone over the weekend March 19th, we had booked our stay thro ugh secret escapes and when it came to check in we were luckily enough to have received a room upgrade to the royal suite, which was room 209 on the second floor, the room was traditionally  furnished with all the five star extra's that you would expect!! Including a comprehensive and well stocked mini bar, two sets of robes, one for the bathroom and another for general wear when in the room, complementary water, biscuits (home made by the chef!) and we also received a welcome and complementary bottle of Champagne, in fact this was a…"
March 2016,Very special birthday treat,"We cannot recommend this hotel enough for when you are looking for luxury, great service and amazing location. Fantastic attention to detail. Our car was whisked away on arrival to be parked without fuss. The champagne afternoon tea was an experience in itself, a real joy. Then we found we had been upgraded to a suite as our visit was celebrating a special birthday. Wow- utter luxury. When it was time to head off to the theatre for Mamma Mia, a taxi was hailed for us by the extremely helpful concierge team in seconds. We returned to a beautifully prepared room and hot chocolate. We slept very well in our four poster. A sumptuous breakfast was served in the morning with everything we wanted. I can highly recommend the eggs benedict. A magnificent hotel, the staff are all very…"
February 2016,Service - at its best,"Stayed here in Feb 2016 as a party of 4. We were going to the Royal Albert Hall to see Cirque De Soleil, and the location is spot on for that venue.  I cannot rate the level of service highly enough. Doorman greeted us like old friends, and arranged valet parking for our car, ideal in London.  Reception booking in was swift and welcoming. We were shown to our rooms and offered a tour of the hotel. Welcome card and gifts in our rooms. Our guests had the African room, and we were opposite in a lovely room too. Welcome drink served in you room or in the lounge as you preferred.  Breakfast was excellent. All in all, perfect hotel and location for a London break."
March 2016,A wonderful stay,"We are a middle aged couple visiting London for leisure. This hotel is perfectly situated for visiting the Royal Albert hall and museums.This was our first stay at the milestone but it certainly won't be our last. From the moment we arrived the staff were professional, attentive and sincere without being overpowering. The hotel felt warm and friendly, this is not a modern hotel, the decor is very traditional, lots of wooden paneling, mosaic floors, polished brass all to a very high standard. We had a superior room, enhanced by the attention to detail, fresh flowers, a small box of biscuits handmade by the chef, a handwritten note from the general manager to welcome us and at ""turn down "" time a candle by the bath and a card on the bedside giving the weather forecast for the…"
March 2016,The Milestone does it again!,On a recent business trip to York England we discovered Adele was in concert in London during the stay.  My wife had deliberated about making the trip from York to London but was hesitate in traveling and staying alone in London.  I told her contact The Milestone as we have stayed there previously and had become our hotel of choice when traveling to London.  We contacted the hotel and Joshua and Andres were able to secure tickets for her and my sister who flew from the states just for the concert.  They felt safe traveling and once again the hotel staff were looking out for them.  The kitchen even sent up cupcakes with images of Adele on the top!  Once again kudos to Mr Pike and his staff for an excellent stay.  The truly is our home away from home when in London no question…
March 2016,5 stars all the way!,"We booked this hotel through a secret escapes offer and we hadn't heard of it until we booked. What a place! We stayed 2 nights when visiting the city to catch up with friends and do some  of site seeing.  As the weather was nice, we caught the tube to Gloucester Road and walked to the hotel. Only  10 minutes.   The area round the hotel has some lovely old buildings and right  near Hyde Park.   Walking up to the hotel you can tell it is going to be a great experience. We were greeted at the door and our cases were taken in for us. We were checked in, asked about our plans in London and taken on a mini tour of the hotel.  Our room was a superior King which was beautiful. A good size and nicely decorated. A chilled bottle of champagne awaited us alongside a welcome card and…"
March 2016,Luxury in Kensington,"Just a short walk from the Royal Albert Hall, across the road from Kensington Gardens, this hotel is not cheap. You get exactly what you pay for, a beautiful room in a luxurious setting. Many rooms are themed, and there is an indoor swimming pool. You can take a relaxing afternoon tea with sandwiches, scones and cakes, all freshly made by the hotel's chef.  Whether you stay for a night or your holiday, the service is excellent and you  can be certain you will not be disappointed. Many celebrities choose the hotel, and the lounges are comfortable to sit in on a rainy day and just enjoy the ambience."
March 2016,"Perfect service, great location, fabulous facilities.","We can't recommend this hotel enough, from the moment we entered the hotel we were treated with the most amazing customer service and it continued to the point we left. Nothing at this hotel has been left to chance, the rooms, facilities have been so well thought through to give customers the best experience possible.  The little touches mean a lot, when we returned from the Adele concert we were treated with Adele cupcakes!  This is now our hotel of choice when visiting London.  Absolutely world class!"
March 2016,I second (or third or fourth) everyone's comments,"I'm not going to say anything here that you haven't already read.  The hotel is clean, beautiful, centrally located, really ornate and comfortable, and elegant.  And the sweets they put out at night are unreal.  But I'd say it's the service that stood out the most for me.  They were some of the nicest people I have had the pleasure of meeting.    If I HAD to say one thing...the walls are slightly thinner than I expected and you could hear doors slam and hallway people.  Luckily, it's not a ""young"" hotel, so most of the people who stay there are families, there for business, or ""higher end"" so you're not going to get a bunch of drunk kids running around at night.   Worst thing was the slamming of doors.  Ask for a room at the end of the hallway to mitigate."
March 2016,Gorgeous quaint hotel,"Just had an excellent weekend stay at this marvellous quaint 5 star hotel The hotel is well positioned, minutes away from Kensington palace, Royal Albert Hall and Kensington High Street. All staff are friendly and helpful and keen to help and enhance your stay   Dinner in the hotel was great as was relaxing in the bar and lounge.   We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a king room which had lovely views across Kensington Park. The room itself was well equipped, quiet, clean and comfortable. Lots of nice little touches too.  The only minor point was that there are no tea & coffee making facilities in the room although we believe you can request a complimentary tray we didn't get round to asking for one.   Overall, our new favourite London hotel!"
March 2016,Beautiful hotel with excellent service,"Amazing hotel!!! The room is perfectly decorated, luxurious and clean! Very good airconditioning as well and curtains are fabulous. Perfect location! The bathrooms are very nice as well! The staff are very friendly and extremely helpful which is a huge plus to all travelers. The hotel is absolutely complete ✅✅✅✅ Their tea is to-die-for! Never had tea this good in my life!!!  Would give it a 5 star but some areas in the floor and ceiling creak abit. But its fine! "
March 2016,The Milestone Hotel Kensington,Superb hotel with impeccable service. The staff are very attentive and the hotel has a very warm and homely atmosphere. Superb central London location within a stones throw of Kensington Palace. Fantastic value for money.
March 2016,Exceeds expectations,"The best breakfast we have ever eaten, just about everything you can imagine is cheerfully offered, including honey and lemon for a sore throat.  The dinner was simply perfect but the most outstanding and unique thing is that everyone seems genuinely happy to be there, ""I have never worked anywhere like this before"" is a quote from a smiling member of staff. Bea Tollman, the owner, has much to teach the hotel industry."
February 2016,A Magnificant Hotel,"My husband and just returned from 3 nights at the Milestone Hotel in London. What a magnificant place! Our room was charming, immaculately maintained, and overlooked a beautiful Kensington courtyard. The staff were attentive, friendly and gracious. We loved the heart-healthy breakfast buffet, followed by a number of hot,  delicous, breakfast selections that were perfectly prepared. We worked out in the small but more than adequate exercise room, walked in the park, and ate dinner right down the street 2 out of the 3 nights of our stay.  The location, across from Kensington Palace and adjacent to embassy row could not be better, and though I never spotted William or Kate, I know I will never stay at any other hotel in London. We give this hotel a 5 star rating.  Teri Heyden,…"
March 2016,Perfect!,"Arrived to be greeted at the Taxi, bags taken into the hotel and shown to the front desk. All staff were lovely, once checked in we were given a tour of the hotel. Then shown to our rooms. Both rooms were very different, both absolutely gorgeous. There were little perks that made the stay even better, nice toiletries, biscuits etc. Food was lovely, had breakfast and Lunch and both meals were so tasty! we all wishes we had stayed another night! Will definitely be going again. The hotel has dome very interesting history behind it to, which is detailed in each room."
November 2015,Elegance at its' best!,Attention to detail is the hallmark of any luxury hotel. The Milestone from the incredibly unique architecture to the tea service elegance is personified. The staff is beyond courteous and the best of the best professionally. The Milestone is not a place to stay for the faint of heart as it completely captures the soul from the excellence of the cuisine to the intimacy of the bar. Across from Kensington Palace who could ask for more !
February 2016,A lovely stay at the Milestone,We stayed at the milestone last Sunday and was greeted by the manager who showed us round and gave us a beautiful room (all the rooms at the Milestone are lovely)  We had a delicious dinner in the restaurant and a lovely breakfast the next morning  We cant wait to return it is a very special place
March 2016,Drinks only - we did not stay,We popped in for a drink whilst passing as it looked so warm and welcoming. The gentleman on the door was very friendly and welcoming as were the waiting staff and the piano man was excellent. We were given free canapés with our drinks and spent a lovely couple of hours in there. Would thoroughly recommend!
February 2016,Fantastic! A very special experience.,"From the moment we arrived when the gentleman picked our bags out of the taxi, and welcomed us, the whole experience was very very special. Never have we had such special treatment from a hotel, from the reception staff, the concierge, who gave us a tour of the hotel before taking us up to our room, and personally explaining the facilities there, the exceptional bar and restaurant staff, to the excellent food and atmosphere. It is a real haven in London, feels more like a country house hotel, and a lovely relaxing place to spend time in. The staff genuinely feel more like friends! Thank you, we'll definitely be back as soon as possible!"
January 2016,Consistently amazing!,"This is the third time I have stayed at this hotel. We continue to be amazed by the service, the atmosphere and the attention to detail by the folks at the Milestone.   I'll keep this review simple, but if you are looking for a charming hotel, and you're not so focused on mega-hotel amenities, then you should consider the Milestone. Many of us have high stress/energy lives. The charm and the ambiance of this hotel has an ability to instantly take you out of that world and provide an experience that is just so refreshing.   The hotel is also very well located, about a 5 minute walk from a tub station. There is local shopping, pubs, restaurants, etc etc.   I've stayed at the Milestone three times over three years. Most of the same people are still working there. That tell me they…"
May 2016,Cosy and professional,"Very warm welcome after a long journey back to London. Professional staff, comfortable but rather cluttered room(king sized deluxe apparently)- but still comfortable. Good breakfast apart from quality of scrambled eggs...Altogether enjoyable."
April 2016,"Stylish Boutique Hotel, Wonderful Staff, Disappointing Food","My wife and I stayed in the Red Carnation group hotel in Dorset, and were so impressed that we booked a night in the Group's Milestone hotel for our next visit to London.  We loved the wonderful boutique style of the hotel, with its quality furnishings, and fabulous rooms. But we were overwhelmed by the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. We have never been treated so kindly and made to feel so important to the hotel, in any hotel that we have stayed at in our ( very long) lives to date. This included a tour of the hotel and its public rooms on arrival with an explanation of the hotel's history, We loved the style and comfort of our bedroom, which had everything that you could want. So why only a 4 out of 5 rating ? Simply because, the dining room and our dinner did not…"
May 2016,"Excellent design, friendliest service","My expectations were high based on reading reviews. The formality (staff in tails; elegance of property) suggested stuffiness, and yet the staff were so friendly and helpful and accessible/down to earth) that we felt relaxed and comfortable. They couldn't help us enough. Liam, who checked us in and out, and Leo at the front desk, were delightful and hospitable. Patricio the doorman was always there and very helpful. We wish we could remember everyone else's name. Everyone on staff went out of their way to be friendly, and it seemed sincere. They hire staff who are naturally ""people people""; they all seemed to get along well with each other, too. We also liked the small resistance pool and sauna, after a long day of walking in London. We stayed here during a conference across the…"
April 2016,Classic British Charm.," Our stay at The Milestone was absolutely wonderful.  We were given an apartment perfectly suited to our needs (few stairs as we were traveling with 91 year old Mother).  The staff could not have been more welcoming and attentive.  Thoughtful details abound.  Breakfasts were an elegant and delicious way to start the day.  Dinner in the dining room was superb.  We also enjoyed drinks and snacks in the Stables bar, and light meals were served as we sat by the fire in the living room. We also had a family reunion and amazing Tea service in the Oratory.  We made use of the Hotel's Range Rover, and enjoyed the great location across from Kensington Palace.  Overall, this was perhaps our best hotel experience, ever, and we have The Milestone's extraordinary staff to thank for that.  We…"
April 2016,"Red is the colour, carnation is the flower","This is the fifth time we have stayed at a Red Carnation hotel in London. Its always our choice of brand when we have no specific event planned.  The hotel, like the others in the chain where we have visited are all old buildings, superbly refitted. The room (deluxe king) has everything you might need in an emergency and more besides. Wonderfully comfortable bed and pillows.  But as always with this brand its that little extra: The staff are exceptional. Staff tell us they love working for Red Carnation and I believe them.  What else to add? Its all good."
May 2016,Splendid!,"Brought my daughter here for a four night stay in London. What a pleasure; the staff could not be more accommodating. Just a five minute walk to the High Street tube station. Very beautiful neighborhood. This is very much more like staying in your home, rather than at a hotel. You do pay a five star price for all this, but, you get a proportional experience. There is a lot of walking here, and, lots of stairs. The hotel is in excellent repair. However, the scale of things, hallways, elevators, bathrooms, is quite a bit smaller than in the US. The clientele is very much of a high caliber; quiet place with a very dignified air. Definitely would recommend for a luxury stay in London!"
April 2016,Cocktails in the Stable Bar,"We stayed in an apartment a couple of minutes walk from the Milestone Hotel.  We were looking for a nice place for cocktails and found the Stable Bar to be very inviting so we relaxed for a while.  The service was great and we ended up having snacks and a sandwich and a few additional cocktails.  We recommend this cozy spot if you want a quiet, lovely place."
April 2016,Beautiful Place Must See Memorable,"We were staying in an apartment half a block away on a recent trip to London, and the very first time we passed the hotel, my boyfriend and I remarked upon how absolutely adorable it was - a British porter outside in uniform, picturesque ivy- strewn gate, brick building.  We looked up the hotel online to see that its ranked #2 out of all the hotels in London, and while there wasn't much information on the website regarding Stables, the bar, we planned to drop by at some point, for a cocktail."
April 2016,Always excellent!,"We stay at The Milestone at least once a year. Each time the staff is overwhelming and excellent! It has become a home away from home for us. Try the Breakfast in the room, it's fantastic. Nearby Royal Albert Hall , Kensington Palace and the shops of Kensington High Street you have a lot of possibilities for shopping and leisure. "
April 2016,"Beautiful hotel, full of English charm","My husband and I stayed here for 4 days after finding the apartment we had booked was not at all what we expected.  We absolutely loved this hotel - the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, and went out of the way to make up for our previous disappointment, to ensure we left London with a positive experience. The room was absolutely charming, and we loved the fact that all the rooms were decorated differently - we stayed in the 'jungle' which had a beautiful private balcony!  We also ate in the restaurant one evening, and the food and service was wonderful.  We have definitely left London with a very positive impression, and will stay at the Milestone again. "
March 2016,Fantastic Service,"One of the finest experiences I've had in a hotel. From the moment the staff greeted us we were well taken care of. For our first night in London we wanted to go out to a local pub but found the hotel bar, The Stables, so charming we decided to stay in.  The reason for 4 stars in place of 5, is that our room needed some minor cosmetic repairs. "
March 2016,Love this hotel,"We stayed here for 3 days as part of our honeymoon. Our room was AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL! We stayed at the Margaret Rose Suite. We were welcomed by the most romantic decorations! Chocolates everywhere, lit candles that smelled so good! The staff were also amazing and helpful! They even gave us free champagne! Just awesome! The hotel looks super nice too. Can't complain. Although there was some creaking that scared me, the rest of our stay was just perfect! "
March 2016,Andrew ILLINGWORTH ,We found the whole experience to be one of fantastic standard in every way - my wife and I really enjoyed our stay the staff could not have been more helpful - the location is superb - we enjoyed our visit to Kensington gardens  The full English breakfast was s great start to our day - teddy the door man made our stay 
March 2016,5* Stay,"Our stay at the Milestone hotel was fantastic. Our room was spotless and extremely comfortable with a king size bed and had everything you needed for the perfect stay. We had lunch in the hotel before heading out and the food was superb. We decided to have our breakfast in our room, and again the breakfast was superb. The hotels attention to detail is top notch. We will definitely be returning."
March 2016,Thoroughly enjoyed my stay,"Stayed in Apartment # 5 (two bedrooms, two baths, kitchen, living area, fireplace). They stocked the fridge with juice, bread, jam, bottled water.    We enjoyed our dinner at Chenestons (Milestone restaurant) and the Stables Bar is the best.  The staff are very high service.  Thanks to Fran, Leo, Liam, Fabrizio, Graham and many others for making our stay so comfortable."
March 2016,wonderful stay ruined by horrid experience,"When we arrived at the hotel our room was not ready, so we had to wait in the bar whilst it was cleaned and prepared. It was a minor inconvenience and we didn't mind at the time.although the hotel seemed perfect in every way whilst we stayed, it was not long after we left before we had the first telephone call leaving a message to say we needed to phone the hotel urgently. On doing so the member of staff said he was embarrassed to ask but did we find a Pandora bracelet in our room as a previous guest had left one , when I said of course not as we would have handed it it straight away he asked perhaps on the coffee table? I said definitely not and he apologized for asking.  I was a little upset that what had seemed ike a perfect stay was now marred by the thought that we might…"
March 2016,great hotel,"stayed here on buisness, great staff, great food, very clean.. will come back. the beds are real comfortable and free wi fi, was very quiet to no disturbance from other rooms and tehre are lots of places nearby."
January 2016,best hotel,"This is simply the best hotel in London. I have stayed at many others, including the Connaught, and they do not compare. The service is perfect, the staff friendly and hospitable, and the bar is one of the best. They broght over the staff from the bar at the Halcyon, and it never misses. Walter the bartender is the best! Great small hotel, good breakfast, great box lunch to beat airplane food for the trip home.The personal touches are wonderful, winter includes a hot water bottle in a silk cover and candles in your room at night for turndown, along with a reading light and a nougat. Carolyn King can be proud of her staff, they do a wonderful job. Nice small health club in basement and it is across the street from Kennsington Gardens for runners. There are not many hotels that…"
April 2016,22nd Birthday Treat,"So this is my first review on tripadvisor, and it's safe to say it's worth taking the time out of my working day to do so. I booked a 1 night in a Queen room at the hotel (via booking.com) for my girlfriends 22nd birthday - on the requests I mentioned that it was her birthday and any extra would be appreciated. We got to the hotel around midday and although the room wasn't ready, which it wasn't expected to be, the hotel took our bags off us at the door and offered complimentary champagne and upgrade to a king room! What a way to welcome the guests! My girlfriend had brought a bottle of bubbly to celebrate which we opened in the evening before going out. I left the bottle in cold water in the sink (as you do) and upon return the bottle was in an ice bucket, candles and rose…"
April 2016,Friendly Character,"This lovely hotel just screams character from every corner. The buildings have an intriguing and interesting history including many characters that have lived and worked there throughout the centuries. The staff throughout the hotel were simply wonderful. Help and advice was always at hand during our stay in an extremely friendly and expert way.  Breakfast was simply outstanding. Choice, quality, variety, served in a room that felt, in a good way, as if we had been transported back in time. Situated close to The Royal Albert Hall, close to Bus and Tube connections and just across the road from Kensington Palace and Gardens, an ideal location. Do not miss this place, fantastic."
April 2016,Afternoon tea fit for a princess,"I booked afternoon tea for my 5 year old daughter and me. We chose the Milestone Hotel as they do a special children's afternoon tea and I wanted the experience to be a good one for her. My daughter is quite grown-up for her age and behaves very well, but I was concerned that she might not be made to feel welcome. I needn't have worried. From the delightful doorman to the lovely waiting staff, the pastry chef and the concierge, everyone made us feel extremely welcome and my daughter was truly treated like a princess.   The decor in the Park  Lounge is quite formal and very intimate, so I would not recommend it for children who are younger or have trouble sitting still for long periods of time, but we loved it. It was calm and peaceful with a great view of the park. I had the…"
April 2016,Best Hotel,"Having stayed at many five star hotels in London we can only describe The Milestone as the best for lots of reasons. We have stayed in Red Carnation Hotels before in the UK and abroad and have never been disappointed. The staff and service are second to none, friendly attentive and knowledgeable. The location was excellent and easy to access all parts of central London. We stayed for three nights and were upgraded to an apartment which we greatly appreciated- it was spacious, comfortable and had all the extras that one could wish for with excellent complimentary Wi Fi. We would definitely stay here again"
March 2016,40th Wedding Anniversary,"We were made welcome from the dot go and a tour of facilities(except spa)so cannot comment on that area.We went up a floor via lift to our Room which was well furnished and quaint, comfy bed ''oldie worldy feel''.everything you need in the room. Dinner was good in the authentic restaurant, service excellent The whole Hotel has like a ''Dickens'' feel about it.The Doorman Stephen was very freindly and helpfull as was all the staff really.My wife and I were really pleased we chose the ''Milestone'' for our Celebration and the Suprise of Flowers,Chocolates and Candles etc in our Room when we retired to Bed,Great touch and well done.! Location of Hotel is spot on for Parks,Tube,Theatre,Restaurants,Pubs,Palace and Museums.So if you are looking for a great Location and a bit of…"
April 2016,Amazing milestone,"We enjoyed 2 wonderful nights at this hotel. We had a super king room, it was cosy and beautifully decorated with rich vibrant colours. It was very clean, house keeping and the reception enquired if all was to standard - which it was. Our room wasn't ready on check-in which was ashame - but we had a brief tour of the hotel and took lunch in the conservatory. We had a 3 course meal included, though the options were limited, we enjoyed our meal both nights. The breakfasts both morning were a real treat and I must say the soufflé pancakes were incredible. This is an amazing hotel, which is worth every penny.  What really makes the hotel are the staff, who are from every corner of the world, they were so friendly.  This is a hotel which isn't pretencious, where every guest is…"
April 2016,Lovely Hotel,"Such a lovely hotel! The staff are very polite and welcoming, the room we stayed in was gorgeous - and the shower is amazing!!! I struggled to get out :o)   Upon arriving to our room, we were offered a complimentary drink of our choice. Scattered around the room were little gifts, all addressed to me including a welcoming card.   Unfortunately we didn't eat at the hotel so didn't experience the restaurant.   Would definitely stay again and strongly recommend it! Xx "
March 2016,Best Authentic Hotel in London,"Everything about this place was exactly what you would hope.  Doorman excellent, helpful and friendly.  Every person ( at least 6 that I met ) at the front desk was great.  Our waitress for breakfast every day was great.  Both concierges helped make the trip fantastic.  The location is perfect.  Coming back at 10:00 pm after a long day and having tea and the best fresh scones was the best way to end our days.  The rooms are small which is expected but very nice and comfortable and other than a rest or to sleep you shouldn't be in the rooms anyway.  Too much to see and do and explore.  Will definitely stay there again if we go back to London.  Thank you Milestone for a perfect place to stay on vacation with my wife and 3 kids!!"
April 2016,Felt like a guest of the Queen!,"Beautiful facilities, incredible service, and great location directly across from Hyde Park and Kensington Palace!  Our rooms were lovely, comfortable, and so peaceful.  The staff was absolutely the best of any hotel I've ever visited-- the doormen Fran and Steven, Leo at the front desk, Joshua and Tim the concierges-- everyone made us feel incredibly at home and attended to every need.  At one point, we left to walk in the park and Joshua literally ran after us down the street to give us an umbrella.   In addition, Cheneston's restaurant was absolutely fabulous-- the menu, the food, the service, and the setting.  We didn't want to go outside!"
March 2016,Wonderful one night stay,"My brief stay was delightful, a gorgeous room stocked with everything you could possibly need, attentive and charming staff, a delicious breakfast.  The Milestone is an oasis of calm and tranquillity in the heart of London.  Highly recommended!"
March 2016,Wonderful.  ,"Another wonderful time at the Milestone. A belated birthday treat for me from my Mum. We were joined by my youngest daughter and fiance. Both rooms were gorgeous. I had a welcome back card waiting for me, a lovely touch. The extra little treats, teabags (my favourite)  home-made biscuits and sweets make you feel special. On our return from the Royal Albert Hall there was a birthday card and yummy strawberries dipped in chocolate waiting for me.  My daughter felt guilty as she had left her room in a mess before we went out for the evening and on our return everything had been tidied.  The awesome staff are what really make your stay special,  always friendly, helpful and attentive.  I am looking forward to returning again in May. "
March 2016,An excellent mini-break,"We have just had a very enjoyable 2 night stay at The Milestone.  All was superb - from the deluxe double room, the home made cookies waiting for us, and the amazing French toast served for breakfast.  We dined in on one evening and were treated to a lovely meal.  Also a perfect location, close to the underground and a stones throw from Kensington Gardens - perfect for a leisurely stroll.  What stands out most though is the staff - so attentive and engaging, nothing was too much trouble - a breath of fresh air!  I am sure we will return.  Cathy R."
March 2016,A gem!,"I can wholeheartedly recommend this hotel.   I think the most important feature of a really great hotel is its staff and Milestone did not let us down in this respect. All staff we met during our 3 night stay were very friendly, fast and professional but also informal in a pleasant way. It also seemed they enjoyed their work and had a good time together.  The hotel is beautifully decorated in a very traditional British way, full of nice details in rooms, restaurant and public areas.  Some examples of great service: morning gowns were available in the room in the right size for my kids, clearly prepared based on given check in information. Teddy bears and puzzle books as gifts along with a box of cookies. An EU electric adapter ready in the room and when we asked for an extra it…"
March 2016,The London Hotel of One's Dreams,The hotel seems as if it has been plucked out of a story book.  It is the London that one envisions in one's dreams.  The rooms are intimate and beautifully appointed.  The service is over the top!  A special kudos to Stephen and Andreas for making our stay so special.
April 2016,Classy and inviting,"We had the most amazing time in London for our anniversary.  It was made even better by having a warm and comfortable place to rejuvenate after a long day of sightseeing.  The Milestone Hotel is a quaint facility in Kensington.  It's location is convenient as there were places we wanted to see within walking distance (Notting Hill, Kensington Palace and Gardens) as well as a tube station a short walk away.  The room was extremely comfortable with turn down service every night that included a treat, bottled water and lit candles. We had a beautiful breakfast daily in the downstairs restaurant (continental and English were offered) and nightly cocktails in the lounge area which felt like home. One morning we had to get up early and they provided a wake up call with coffee…"
March 2016,Take me there again,"Excellent service, clean and crisp room, amazing facilities, superior dining experience and very good location. We have enjoyed every part of our stay at the Milestone and couldn't fault a thing ! Cannot but look forward to come back."
January 2016,Amazing service at The Milestone.,"My family and I truly enjoyed our stay at The Milestone Hotel. The service was excellent and some of the best I have experienced anywhere in the world. The employees sincerely seemed to care that their guests were taken care of and happy. As a runner, I loved the location across from Kensington and Hyde Parks. The added perks of wonderful chocolates and treats in the lobby as well as in our room upon arrival and every evening was a wonderful touch."
March 2016,Excellent,"Location - Kensington a few minutes walk to the high street, tubes, bus stops and a stones through from Kensington Palace. Check in - Superb, room wasn't ready we were very early offered a complimentary drink in the bar. Room - Amazing, everything you could want for, luxury towels, luxury bed linen, complimentary home made biscuits in room .tv, ipod docking station. complimentary water.And spotless Breakfast - Best pancakes I have ever tasted. service superb , small but lovely restaurant.

March 2016,Great place for a glass of Champagne!,"Our first visit here will be the first of many! Excellent service from all staff in hotel and  Stables Bar. Relaxed, tasteful and comfortable surroundings. specially good for couples and small groups. Bar staff make fantastic Cocktails! Intimate, friendly and large helping of quality, well done The Milestone!"
March 2016,I loved to stay here,There is so much to tell about the hotel. Check in by friendly staff was pleasurable. The room was spotlessly neat. They offered complementary beverages with the wake-up call. There is a lot to choose about the room to make you comfortable like pillow menu. I simply loved to stay here. 
February 2016,The Royal Treatment,"Such a charming and unique hotel it’s rather hard to describe but here’s a go.  Décor Very English –traditional and impeccable.  Our room was cosy, well equipped and spotless.  Many of the furnishing are proper antiques. SO many little sweet touches, like cookies in the room and candles lit in the bathtub when they turn down.  It’s a home more than a room.  Staff EVERYONE treats you like an old friend, from the moment you arrive till when you leave and they come to say farewell.  You feel like royalty!  Value For the location and level, the prices are excellent, many meals and around £100 for TWO!  Location Can it get better?  Views of the park and moments from all that London has to offer  Cheneston's Restaurant Sunday Afternoon Lunch - Excellent traditional meal served in a…"
March 2016,Best stay every!,"I loved this hotel. I would come back over and over again. There are not enough words to describe everything: starting by the check in and the tour of the hotel done by Frans, following by the abundant details in the room ( a flower, some Easter chocolates, and even some prunes by the bedside1 ) following with the wake up call with complimentary delivery of your choice of beverage to your room  ( what a way to wake up! )  . The bar has a english sense and  delicious drinks prepared by Plinio and Marcos. The afternoon tea with piano music on the background amazing, Jose the concierge helped us in every need we had. For breakfast I had the most fluffy pancakes ever done and the eggs benedict looked amazing. Dinner was great served by Francisco ( I think ) in a beautiful cozy…"
March 2016,One of the best hotels in London!,"We stayed here for one night recently and it was fabulous.  I have stayed at many top London hotels, including the Ritz, Claridges and the Savoy and this one is undoubtedly in the same category.  We were lucky enough to be in the Kensington Gardens Suite which was beautiful, on two levels, spotlessly clean and with every amenity you can think of.  It is the little touches which make this hotel so special - homemade cookies in your room etc and on turndown we even got a little book and a booklight each - amazing.  But it is really the staff here that make this hotel.  Every single member of staff that I encountered without exception was friendly, professional without any elements of snobbery that you can encounter in 5* hotels.  All genuinely friendly and wanting to make our stay…"
March 2016,"Great, great hotel","If you are looking for  a 5-star hotel w old world charm and outstanding staff and service, this is where you should stay. The hotel is located directly across from Kensington Park, has access to both Notting Hill, Kensington and South Kensington restaurants and is close to several convenient tube stops."
December 2015,Superb.,"We stayed here in the New Year. One of the nicest hotels in the area. It Even accepts pets. We bought our new German Shepherd puppy to stay with us and everything was first class for him including a dog menu , feeding/water bowl, toys and even his own bed. fantastic.  The facilities for us were  just as good, including my own birthday cake,champagne, treats, balcony, lovely comfy bed and anything else we could possibly need.  The staff here are exceptional, they really do go out of there way to help you. I did have one problem with the breakfast one morning. They were full so we sat in the front area and ordered breakfast and proceeded to wait, and wait. I think the waitress forgot we were there because I'm sure in the best of worlds it does not take 40 minutes to make an…"
February 2016,Outstanding!,"A first class experience with incredible staff on hand to service your every need. Wonderfully attentive, friendly and helpful. The hotel is small and perfectly formed. Food was exceptional value for money too. All in all a wonderful stay. We will certainly be back!"
February 2016,"So impressed with this lovely, exquisite, small, ""hidden gem of a Hotel"" !!","Located opposite Kensington Gardens/Kensington Palace.  We wanted somewhere within easy access of the Royal Albert Hall and special, since we were celebrating a 70th birthday with family and friends.  We were not disappointed.  Only 45 beautifully appointed rooms, decorated in totally individual styles and themes.  Public rooms all stunning, staff ., without exception, welcoming, courteous, pleasant, very helpful and nothing was too much trouble.  Restaurant/dining rooms fabulous and a great bar with super cocktails!! Very good breakfast and they are also open for afternoon tea.  We really cannot wait to stay there again.  We think that nowadays it's rare to find somewhere that is the real deal .. This one has it in spades!!!"
February 2016,Amazing hotel,"We booked through Secret Escapes and got a very good deal, but this in no way what so ever was reflected in the service we got, from the moment we entered everything was perfect. Someone rushed to open the taxi door for us, and help with bags. We let them know we were celebrating our anniversary and were upgraded to a Junior Suite, which was beautiful. There was a lovely outdoor terrace, if it was sunny that would have been lovely! Our rate included champagne in the room, which we chose to upgrade. There were delicious home made biscuits in the room, and we were offered a complimentary welcome drink, more champagne! The room was beautiful, every little touch was thought of (shame the ipod docking station was for the older iphone/ipods- but that is the only insignificant thing i…"
February 2016,Faultless stay,"Booked to stay in the milestone for one night and was upgraded to a Junior Suite. Room was immaculate. Staff were friendly, helpful and approachable. We both had a beauty treatment which I would wholly recommend. The resistance pool was more of a large sized jacuzzi but this does not affect my rating as it was still lovely to relax in there before using the hotels' sauna. The room service menu was very varied and fairly priced. In all I would highly recommend the Milestone. It's like stepping back in time and a gorgeous place to escape for a night or two. We'll definitely be back."
February 2016,Fab relaxed afternoon tea,"I visited for afternoon tea with some former work colleagues and was not disappointed.  The choice of sandwiches, pastries and teas was great and we made it an extra treat with a glass of bubbly.  One of our party has several food allergies so we'd asked for a vegan option which I thought was a bit of an ask for an afternoon tea menu but they went right of their way with specially baked bread and scones and some really imaginative and tasty alternatives to the cakes, pastries and fillings, it must have been all designed from scratch for this one person which was very impressive.  The service was second to none, attentive, friendly, informed and relaxed and the setting was lovely.  We were right in front of a roaring fire and the room was relaxed and comfortable and we did not…"
February 2016,Best hotel I have stayed at in London,Just back from this fantastic hotel.  Everything about it great and nothing is too much troulble.  All of the staff are amazing...so attentive.  The rooms are lovely and lots of little extras which make your stay feel special.  The food was excellent and served in beautiful surroundings.  We can't wait to go back.  Thanks for a great weekend
November 2015,Tea and tour..,"Although we were unable to stay at the Milestone this visit we have stayed at the sister Red Carnation property the Montague on the Gardens. I wanted to check out the Milestone and it is superb with the charming English decor we love to find in England and the special services this brand offers. Our visit was on a very rainy day and we arrived drenched but taken instantly in hand by the front staff. Coats and umbrellas dealt with we toured the bar and other public rooms, several suites and longer term apartments (very reasonable for London) then in for tea. I've had tea at the Ritz, the Shard and in Windsor near the castle. The Milestone served up all the best sandwiches, pastry and unique desserts. Scones are brought out hot and fresh. The  tea room is like something on Downton…"
February 2016,Best Afternoon Tea in London,"We went to the milestone for afternoon tea for my wife’s birthday accompanied by our 4 and 6 yr old boys.  We all had an amazing time .  The boys couldn’t believe it when they got their own cake stands with sandwiches, scones and cakes and we also had an absolutely sumptuous feast!  Highlights for the food were the hot scones and the chicken sandwiches.  Go with an appetite, we went for the 1pm tea and skipped lunch and we still couldn’t finish everything (I did try)!  The location right opposite Hyde park and about 5 minutes walk from the Princess Diana Memorial Playground make it an ideal location for a day out with kids. Lovely!"
February 2016,Absolute gem in Kensington,"A very comfortable & cosy hotel in leafy Kensington next to the park. We were greeted on arrival, showed to the room & offered a welcome drink. The welcome was most gracious thanks to the Front Office team from the Concierge to the Receptionist. The breakfast was lovely & we managed to walk around to explore the next day. A must visit again!!"
February 2016,Best service in London!,"We were in London last week and we decided to give the Milestone Hotel a try as we usually stay in another hotel in the Kensington area.  It was a great decision!  The hotel is extremely welcoming and helpful.  From the moment we were greeted at the door until checkout, we were pleased.  The staff couldn't have been more accommodating or pleasant.  The concierge was quick to find just what we required, even helping my husband to get flowers for me for Valentine's Day."
February 2016,I wish I could give 10 stars!!!,"The Milestone is absolutely fabulous!  I read many reviews of this hotel and then went to the hotel's website.  Then I was sold!  We stayed 5 nights and we were enchanted every day.  The staff was so accommodating and professional.  Our favorite time at the hotel was breakfast with the charming and ""quirky"" (that's an inside joke!) Devon, Immaculata, Magdalena and Jack.  They started our day off on the right foot.  Of course, we cannot fail to mention the Saddle Bar with Fabrizio II and Palido (spelling???).  Fabrizio Russo, the beverage and food manager, made sure we received the best service possible.  The concierges, Jose and Joshua, were so helpful in securing reservations for us at the most wonderful restaurants.  The location of the hotel is wonderful--just across the…"
February 2016,Every detail is catered for,"A great hotel in a great location with friendly staff who think of everything. Lots of nice touches - welcome drink, offers to book your night out, everything you need in your room. This doesn't stop when you're leaving - even water for your journey home. "
February 2016,the friendliest people in London work here,"The warmest and most professional people in London all seem to work here. They kindly make you aware of the facilities without it seeming like pushy selling, and they seem to take a genuine interest in your day whilst putting you at ease. There might be many beautiful rooms to stay in nearby, but the competition would have difficulty in bettering the atmosphere the staff create. The room was beautifully clean as was the communal areas. The bar felt luxurious and we were attended to without being interrupted, or feeling like a sales pitch was underway. It was a real treat to go to the milestone as it was more than I might usually consider spending on myself- but I felt a million dollars, and the memories I have of my visit are priceless."
February 2016,A perfect location with welcoming and friendly staff,"The perfect location for us catching a show at the Royal Albert Hall. The staff were all superb, incredibly attentive without ever feeling over the top. The whole experience was filled with many small surprising details which made our stay memorable. We will be returning. It was also nice to have a walk around Kensington Gardens, directly opposite, before checking out."
February 2016,The magnificent Milestone,"A beautiful hotel with friendly attentive staff. They make your stay truly special with lots of little touches that really make it 5 star. Great location, just 5 mins walk from the Royal Albert Hall and just a stones throw from Kensington Gardens for a leisurely stroll. The Stables Bar had a great atmosphere and dinner in the restaurant was very nice. Will definitely return and would recommend anything me to stay. "
December 2015,Family Christmas in London,"Staying at the Milestone Hotel was the Christmas gift that just kept giving. From the moment we checked in, it felt like a Charles Dickens novel and Eloise-at-the-Plaza kind of magic, for the children and adults. And for two weeks, this was our home. Though the hotel is impeccably maintained and beautifully decorated, we felt comfortable walking around or taking a book and sitting fireside. No need to tiptoe around as if you were in a museum. For our children, ages 9 and 11, they were encouraged to explore hotel, play hide-and-seek, and chat with the staff. Within a couple of days, our children knew everyone’s name, and the staff knew theirs. It was a safe place for my husband and I to get a pre-dinner drink at the bar and have the kids meet us later. Sometimes we’d find our son…"
January 2016,Amazing staff and service,We booked through Secret Escapes as a Christmas present for ourselves and stayed in mid January.  We have been lucky enough to stay in many hotels in London for weekend breaks but no other hotel has staff that are both professional but warm and welcoming as well without being over familiar.  So helpful too. They have got the balance just right.   The attention to detail in the hotel is perfect. Breakfast was delicious and perfectly cooked.  We had a thoroughly enjoyable stay and we will definitely return and recommend to our friends and family.
February 2016,Hard to beat!,"We stayed overnight at the Milestone hotel, travelling from Essex to the City for a weekend break.  From the point of arrival we were given excellent service & made to feel very welcome. We were shown around the hotel before being taken to our room where we had been given an upgrade. There was a bottle of champagne in the fridge & chocolate hearts & rose petals on the bed for valentines. Home made cookies & tea were also boxed up along with a little bag of prunes.(that's a first & made us smile) The attention to detail really made our stay extra special and the care and attention was like nothing we have experienced before. The hotel was spotlessly clean, but also homely & comfortable. We had a meal in the Cheneston's restaurant where the food & wine was delicious, the waiting…"
February 2016,Perfect,"A wonderful boutique hotel. My wife and I love it and can't wait until our next stay. Though it was the first time we stayed at the hotel, we had visited before on several occasions for afternoon tea and dinner. We had high expectations and they were surpassed. A massive thank you to all at the Milestone for creating such a wonderful experience."
February 2016,Perfect!,"When we booked tickets for Cirque du Soleil at the Royal Albert Hall, I noticed an offer for the Milestone on Secret Escapes. Given that it was a great location for getting to the show, I booked it. We thought the hotel was superb, from the moment we stepped out of the taxi. The service is exceptional. The building is stunning. The room was immaculate & we loved all the little touches like the handmade bookmark, chef-made biscuits, bottle of champagne, candles lit in the evening..(personally, I loved the sanitised TV remote control!!). We usually don't sleep well in hotel rooms but we did here. The room was cosy & quiet, & the bed was comfy. The breakfast was absolutely delicious. We cannot fault this hotel & will certainly be back - can't wait, & next time we will stay longer!…"
February 2016,"Superb, faultless, delightful hotel - just perfect","I cannot praise this hotel and its wonderful staff enough. We booked a last minute stay at the Milestone Hotel to not only celebrate our 20th anniversary, but to also do some sightseeing as a family. The staff were so very friendly and welcoming (Steven in particular was a true English gentleman - he always had a beaming smile even in the freezing cold temperatures outside) and the service and attention to detail was second to none.  There are so many things I could say, but in summary the location was perfect, the breakfast was delicious and the rooms were delightful."
January 2016,Wow!,"Booked through Secret Escapes as a Christmas present for my wife. Probably the best hotel we have stayed in!  Paid a very good price through Secret Escapes, but this made absolutely no mark whatsoever on the level of service received.  As soon as we walked in the staff were attentive and very nice. At the reception desk, we were upgraded to a King room and all the details were dealt with efficiently and to an excellent standard. We were then given an optional tour of the hotel where we were given a brief history of the hotel and shown the various main rooms (restaurant, bar, etc) before being shown all the way to our room. The room was exceptional. The bottle of champagne on the side (part of the deal) along with a personal, handwritten, card (envelope and all) and a few little…"
February 2016,THE Boutique Hotel in London,"My partner booked an overnight stay for us as a treat, and what a treat it turned out to be! We had eaten at the restaurant last year before visiting the Albert Hall and been charmed by this quaint, boutique hotel, so we arrived with high expectations.  We were not disappointed in any respect. The service at the Milestone is second to none. From the moment we arrived, we felt thoroughly spoilt.  On arrival, we were offered a welcome tea or coffee, with homemade biscuits. Our beautifully appointed room had more biscuits, bottled water, fresh flowers,Penhaligons toilettries. Simply wonderful.  We had drinks in the bar before dinner. Again, with faultless service, a fine Port Ellen scotch, delicious canapés; we didn't want to leave.  But we did, as dinner beckoned. We had dinner…"
February 2016,Afternoon Tea,"Great service and a wonderfully cozy way to spend Valentine's Day with my family. We had a reservation for 5pm and arrived an hour late because of horrendous traffic. They graciously accommodated us anyway and we enjoyed our tea, delicious scones and sandwiches by the fire. "
August 2015,Best Unexpected Layover Ever!,"I had and unexpected layover in London with my husband and four kids last August en route back to the US from Italy. We were lucky enough to snag a couple of rooms at the Milestone through our American Express card.The hotel manager could not have been more kind and accommodating. We arrived harried and weary from 22 hours of delays, cancelled flights and rerouting. My kids were past the point of hungry and approaching anarchy. The manager sent complimentary food and drinks to their room and paid for our food and Guinness (desperately needed) at the pub. The rest of the staff and the hotel were truly superb! Our room was over the top hip,well appointed and comfortable. The beds were excellent. I don't often go to London but would book a trip there again just to stay at the…"
February 2016,Unashamed luxury,"We have stayed at other hotels in The Red Carnation Group around the world and our experience in all of them has been characterised by service excellence, attention to detail and unashamed luxury. The Milestone was no exception. The hotel adhered fully to the group's statement of ""Core Values"" which is on the Red Carnation website. A wonderful weekend stay! I have reviewed the Cheneston Restaurant separately."
February 2016,short break,"This is probably finest hotel we have ever stayed at, and the welcome we received on arrival was second to none. We were given a guided tour of all the amenities and shown to our room which was beautifully appointed with classic period furniture and a Super king size bed.  The hotel is situated on Kensington High St overlooking Kensington Palace and is ideal for exploring the park, The Albert Memorial and Royal Albert Hall. Our 3 course dinner, which was included in the price, was excellent and from the extensive menu. As we had let slip that it was our anniversary, when we returned to our room we found that not only had the bed been turned down, but the whole room had been decorated with rose petals, tea lights and chocolates. To say we were delighted would be a complete…"
January 2016,Boutique hotel extravagance at it's absolute best!,"We stayed over at the Milestone Hotel for one night while touring about London. Checking in was professionally conducted, and a breeze. There after Fran took us to our suite, The Harlequin Suite, and introduced all the amenities. We declined having our bags unpacked for us, as we were only there for the one night - and mores the pity! Everything in the room was as you would expect it to be for such an exquisitely rendered establishment, and there is nothing we could possibly complain about. We had a blast, and even enjoyed a late-night feast of hot chocolate and ice-cream! Breakfast was another satisfying repast, and we especially enjoyed conversing with Devon, who ran the room. Nicely done Red Carnation Hotel Group, we feel honoured to have experienced your hotel, and it will…"
January 2016,Amazing/fabulous ,Had an amazing time here from the moment we walked through the door to the moment we left. It's an oasis in the centre of London. Our room was perfect everything you could want. Had a 3 course meal which was delicious I actually couldn't eat it all which was a shame. Breakfast equally as good. The staff are an asset to the hotel there was nothing you could want for they went above and beyond all expectations.  A 2nd visit is a must but more than one night would be fabulous 
January 2016,Wonderful hotel,Stayed on a Saturday night in January. Requested an early check in and room was ready when we arrived at 10am. Staff were lovely and very helpful. Hotel in a perfect location opposite Hyde park and near tube stations and lots of shops. Fabulous breakfast too!! Will definitely be back!
January 2016,An outstanding hotel,"We recently stayed only one night at the Milestone to see the London Luminiere, and would have liked to stay there a lot longer.  The difference between one 5 star property and another in London is often the staff attitude, and this is where the Milestone scores from check-in to leaving.   The receptionist, cannot remember his name but he came from Durham, was friendly, interested in why we were staying in London and offered any help he could.   On check out he remembered why we came, and asked  what we thought of the event. We stayed in a standard room, which, although not large, is extremely comfortable with a selection of Matisse prints and understated décor.   The bathroom, with Penhaligon toiletries, is a good sized, but a walk in shower would have ben preferable rather…"
January 2016,Very welcoming staff,"My husband and I have spent three wonderful nights at the Milestone hotel we were offered an upgrade to a King suite (Savile Row room) .  This was our first stay at the Milestone and the staff made us feel very welcome and they were very helpful throughout our stay.  The room was stunning with wonderful views over Hyde Park, made all the more pleasurable with the bottle of chilled Moet champagne.  My husband who is a very light sleeper was disturbed by noise during the night,, again the staff could not have been more accommodating and helpful.    It was my birthday the next day and we went out for the day, on our return I found in our room a lovely Birthday card and wonderful Birthday cake from the Milestone and the offer of another upgrade to a Junior suite which we took them…"
December 2015,"Great Staff, Great Location",We stayed for a week between Christmas and New Years 2015 at the Milestone Hotel and we were so happy that we did.  The staff could not have been more accommodating and the facility is beautiful.  The hotel is perfectly situated directly across the street from Kensington Garden and an easy walk from the tube and shops.  The greatest asset that the Milestone has is it's staff.  Everyone there was so pleasant and helpful to our family.  There was no request that we made that they did not quickly and efficiently accommodate.  If you get the chance to book a room there do not hesitate.
January 2016,Brilliant Holiday,"We stayed for a week over New Years at Milestone Hotel, one of the Red Carnation Boutique Hotels, located across from Kensington Palace. Wow! The British hospitality and personal service was impeccable. The proper staff was superlative in ensuring we were enjoying our visit on many levels throughout our stay. A highlight experience was the Afternoon Tea at Milestone, positively regal!   The concierge's recommendations were fantastic; especially resturants and the  ""Big Bus Tour"". The staff on the tour were extremely gracious, informative, and entertaining.   In closing I want to thank the doorman, butler, front desk, waitstaff and the concierges for a positively ethereal experience. It's evident that the management have a corporate culture with the highest level of service!"
January 2016,Bliss,"Just had a night at the Milestone and what a wonderful short experience it was, lucky to start with as we were offered an upgrade which was very welcomed. Apart from being beautifully decorated and furnished what makes this hotel outstanding are the staff. It seems red carnation are a good company to work for and it comes across with the cheerful and exceptionally efficient workforce who do everything to make your stay memorable. One of the best hotels I've been to and I can't sing there praises high enough."
December 2015,Wonderful surprise,"We stayed recently and we could not be made more welcome or treated any better. All hotels should be like this , we could of stayed in the Royal Kensington which is a stones throw away from this hotel but chose the Milestone out of curiosity and  we were not dissapointed. Sadly we could only stay one night, I would gladly move in permantly.we had a cocktail in the bar in the evening served by two excellent bar staff in white tuxedos and bow ties , definitley from a different era. The breakfast next morning was superb with freshly squeezed fruit juices, not from a carton. Already planning my next stay. Thanks to all the staff at the Miestone."
December 2015,Delightfully British Hotel,"From the very first minute we felt at home...the parlor as familiar as my own living room. The dining room served delicious food, and afternoon tea was wonderful. Service of the highest standards and very friendly staff who will do anything to make your stay enjoyable. The hotel is impeccably clean and cozy, albeit the rooms are fairly small. It has become our hotel of choice when visiting London."
January 2016,Excellent service,This is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed. Clean and classic. I stayed in the Kensington Garden Suite which is a split level suite through large floor-to-ceiling by window full of an air of romance and femininity.  All the service are comfortably provided. Make me feel like home.   I'm looking forward to go back.
December 2015,Fabulous,"My wife and I recently had a wonderful stay, and the hotel far exceeded my expectations. From the first minute to the last the staff was courteous, friendly, and efficient; the result was to make my wife and I feel special. Our overall experience is the stimulus for annual visits to London and repeat stays at The Milestone. Fabulous!"
March 2015,Dream hotel,ultimate in service and thoughtfulness.  Having spent almost 30 years travelling extensively for business this is my favourite in terms of things a top hotel can control - service.  Understated style and character are the perfect backdrop to deepthinking meetings.
December 2015,lovely,"very attentive staff, a lovely hotel, a great shame there isn't a no phone rule during breakfast, but could not fault the staff or the hotel. our Christmas stay for  olympia horse show was very special, however we would have also loved to have hired the Bentley to collect us alas I think that would have been enjoying ourselves too much!"
January 2016,"Ouch, room very noisy on this trip","Third review of this hotel...first two scored five but this time the room was really noisy from some kind of mechanical equipment in the building directly abutting the Hotel (It was room 109).  We were supposed to have an upgrade room, and it had a wonderful view and great decorations, but the noise was all night long, every night.  Surely the hotel is aware of this and, given that it appears the hotel was not at all crowded, they should have either warned us or, more properly for their price and reputation, never put us there to begin with.  Sadly, while we love this property, we cannot abide by such treatment of a repeat customer.  Goodbye Milestone, we will miss the hotel but not the noise."
January 2016,Milestone Magic,"One would imagine staying on top of ""the best of"" hotels lists worldwide must be exhausting business. Proving once that your establishment deserves all the accolades is praise enough indeed. But keeping up that level of intensity and perfection year after year is a feat few hotels can boast. The Milestone does it with style, humility and grace. From the warm curbside greeting you receive at that lovely corner in Kensington; to the effortless check-in at Reception; to the most helpful and creative Concierge desk; to the informative introduction by staff to your room or apartment; to the tantalizing and delicious meals and one of the finest afternoon teas in London, all set in a grand English country style--you are guaranteed to be properly pampered. The hurly burly of High Street…"
December 2015,Outstanding service and delicious Christmas Eve dinner 2015,"Our family enjoyed a truly memorable Christmas Eve dinner at the Milestone dining room. The dining room itself was small but beautifully decorated. We were offered canapes and drinks in the drawing room in front of a roaring open fire - this was a real treat.  The meal itself was innovative yet traditional at the same time - goose with trimmings, interesting entrees, lovely bread and delicious desserts/puddings.    Thank you to the staff who made this night so special for us."
October 2015,Historical place,"You'll feel yourself like a king while entering that palace, very luxurious Victorian décor, staff are helpful and the management is doing its best to make the stay pleasant .One of the best luxurious hotel in London ."
March 2015,Romantic night away ,"Me and my husband stayed here before my son was born. Fantastic hotel, and extremely helpful staff.  Very welcoming, and lovely.  Great location, opposite Hyde park.  The only downfall was the room size, was very small, not much floor space. Luckily we travelled light :-) "
January 2016,The devil is in the detail,"This beautiful hotel has it right in so many areas, but  it is the staff who take it to another level, everyone we encountered was friendly, respectful and professional , and looked like they liked working there. our lovely room had everything we could think of, fresh flowers and a package of homemade cookies to enjoy with our tea, and I mean everything, even a pair of scissors to deal with a loose thread on my dress, someone has take  great interest in what will be useful.a hand written note from the manager, and a small welcome back gift made it feel like you were staying with friends.the bottle,of champagne in our room was cold and on ice for our arrival.and a tray so we could make our own tea and coffee arrived within minutes, dinner taken in house was delicious, imaginative…"
December 2015,Wonderful boutique hotel,"I stayed at this lovely hotel for five days at the beginning of December with my six year old son . I frequently travel to London and have stayed in various five star hotels over the years but this was my first stay at the Milestone . I was looking for a child friendly hotel close to Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park and saw the wonderful reviews on trip-advisor and decided to book. I am so happy I did , the hotel lives up to all the praise it receives from reviewers.  I really cannot find fault with anything. We were upgraded upon arrival to a beautiful suite. There were so many little touches that made it so special, champagne for me on arrival and sweets for my son , complimentary canapés delivered to our suite, a different sweet surprise on our bed every evening as part of…"
November 2015,Getting better all the time and exceeded my expectations again,"We stay here regularly, and truly once I walk through the door I breathe easier and relax, it feels like home. This time after a rather hectic period all the right notes to celebrate so many wonderful things were delivered beyond expectations. All the staff, in particular Devon at breakfast, Jose who secured tickets to the sold out shows, everyone was amazing. So friendly. But wait there's more! Don't miss out on having a facial with Fiona, she is amazing and how she manages to deliver such an amazing experience in such a small space beggars belief. If we could have managed to get my hair sorted life would've have been perfect."
December 2015,5* Afternoon Tea,"I have just returned from the Milestone Hotel for my daughter's 12th birthday celebration with 4 of her friends. We were overwhelmed with the visit. The girls experienced many Wow moments, from their own pot of hot chocolate and their very own cake stand full of delightful sandwiches and delectable pastries (nothing too fancy for their taste). We were booked into the conservatory, because at the time of booking, it was available. We were aware that we would share this room with others, but on the day, had it to ourselves. The children had the Little Princess tea and this was plenty for their appetites; an adult tea would be far too much for them.  The staff are incredibly professional, but far more importantly, they have a warmth and thoughtfulness I have not seen at other…"
November 2015,"As near to perfect ""British"" you will find . ","If you are a visitor to London and want a perfect 5 star British experience then look no further than this lovely hotel . I have lived in London and worked here in the past and wasn't aware of this stunning hotel until I booked through the Leading Hotels of the World. Every member of staff is so well trained and professional that you know you are in a superbly run establishment. It is situated opposite Kensington Gardens which is perfect for a walk if you enjoy doing so and easy access to everything that London has to offer . The bar area is unique and quirky, the prices are normal for London but you get the most fantastic canapés. We had a lovely breakfast in another quirky area but very nice . It is easy to see why this hotel is so highly rated ."
November 2015,Third time staying here and it just keeps getting better,"We've chosen the Milestone for a two night stay in London three years running now and I'm still struggling to find the right words to describe how good it is. I can't find a single thing about the place that isn't absolute perfection - it's the best hotel experience imaginable. I've stayed in other luxury hotels around London - including the Savoy among others, but they can't come close to the experience of the Milestone. The obsessive attention to detail with everything and the unbelievable level of service. Every member of staff will bend over backwards to make you feel welcome and to help out with anything. For me, it's their level of service that sets the Milestone above all the others - I've not experienced such high quality customer service anywhere else, from any other…"
October 2015,Amazing Experience,"Not very often does a hotel experience far, far exceed expectations, but the Milestone is one lovely hotel which does.  It is a lovely grand lady with wonderful amenities.  Very unique and special; a total home-like feeling.  Each area of the down stairs is special and different.  The breakfast are is charming and the food fabulous.  The tea was lovely; the best I have had in London and that includes The Ritz.  Took my daughter there for her first tea experience and she was so excited and felt to special..Service was terrific and everything about the Milestone is grand scale on an intimate level.  Not to be missed!!!"
November 2015,Another fabulous time. ,"I stayed at the Milestone again this weekend. I was with my Mum, brother and sister-in-law. We were upgraded to an apartment. What a great start to the weekend ! We arrived early (09.30) and so was pleasantly  surprised to find the apartment ready for us. The flowers we ordered for my Mum (birthday treat) were already waiting for her.  Everyone is always so cheerful, polite and nothing is too much trouble.  Another 2 members of the family popped in for breakfast on Sunday and we all enjoyed wide variety of hot and cold food.  We have already booked another visit for March 2016.  Lovely people and a lovely hotel. 😃  "
September 2015,Fantastic ,It was an absolute pleasure to stay at this hotel. Luxurious rooms with everything you could possibly want or need is at hand or a phone call away. Beautifully soft beds and lovely linen which was fresh and clean. The whole room was spotless. Delightful staff who will go out of their way to accomodate you. Will definitely return. 
November 2015,Fabulous Hotel !,"We recently had the pleasure to stay at this gem of a hotel and thoroughly enjoyed our stay on our first trip to London.  First off, I have never experienced such an attentive staff before in a hotel as I did at the Milestone.  From check-in, to the bartender and restaurant staff, the concierge, housekeeping…everyone was so pleasant and eager to make our stay a pleasant one.  The quality and design of the hotel common areas and our room were a delight, with small added touches that I have not experienced at other luxury hotels that I have stayed at.  The staff made room for us at their afternoon tea one afternoon on short notice, and it was both charming and delicious, and something you should definitely consider if you staying at this hotel.  It was just a wonderful hotel…"
November 2015,Best Hotel with 5 star true British touch,"Excellent location , superb room service and great cozy traditional British rooms with finest room amenities. Rooms are very clean with  nice furnishings . Value for money and great feeling when you stay here. Break fast is good too expensive . High tea you need to book in advance , presentation at high tea is superb . TOO expensive. But good experience to have one while you are at this property. All staff are very professionally trained and very good knowledge of the London and surroundings . Check in front desk staff are dressed nicely but not that friendly when you check in you see they still lack to offer  the 5 star reception to the guests compare to other 5 star facilities . If you are booking this hotel pl have them included your breakfast . Not too many variety for…"
September 2015,Perfect Escape,"The Milestone Hotel is extremely comfortable and luxurious but not at all intimidating. We thoroughly enjoyed our several nights here and never once heard another guest.  The staff were professional and unobtrusive with no silly attitude. Our room was amazingly clean, beautiful, and chocked full of amenities.  We experienced highly polished staff behaviours in actions and deeds, all evidence of significant training investment.  We chose our visit based on TripAdvisor reviews our experience was born out as suggested by others. Well Done."
October 2015,The Milestone-a most welcoming experience.,"This hotel is as close as I have come to a true British experience.  The ambience is definitely old world charm.  The service is beyond welcoming and attentive.  The bed linens pressed and crisp cotton, the mattress and pillows-perfect for the good night sleep that one needs to be up and about to take in all the sights that only London can provide."
October 2015,The staff is the best!!,"This hotel is on the Amex Fine Hotels program and is also rated highly on Trip Advisor.  Both are well deserved as this hotel exudes class from the moment you arrive, and it doesn't let up through the entire stay.  Chloe, Fran, Pedro, Devon, etc. all are great representatives and made us feel welcome and had fun with us at the same time.  The food there is excellent too. Their chicken pot pie is a must, as well as their wagu burger and the breakfast waffles. The beds are comfortable and room amenities are nice.  One thing to be aware of is, as a tall person, the ceiling in the shower does not leave much room because the tub is a step up.  I made it work, but someone taller than 6'3"" is going to have a tough time standing up without hitting the ceiling.  I would stay here again…"
August 2015,A fantastic afternoon tea,"We took afternoon tea on Sunday 31st January 2015 it was absolutely wonderful, stunning hotel excellent staff and the food was to die for. My advice dont eat the day before and be thankful Hyde Park is across the road as you will be grateful for the walk.   We will be back!"
January 2016,Hope to return!,"This was an anniversary weekend and the excellent reviews were not exaggerated. We also had their afternoon tea and the GF version was amazing. The mattress was very comfortable (I'm picky), the service was excellent. Good location. We didn't have a park view but for me, this was a plus as our courtyard room was very quiet. Yes this is a pretty expensive hotel per night, but definitely worth it. Do not hesitate to book if you don't mind spending a bit."
January 2016,Return Visit,"After considering other options in London we decided to return to the Milestone Hotel for a second visit in November. Needless to say, our stay in the hotel this time was as faultless as the first visit.   As before the service was outstanding with the staff making an effort to engage guests in conversation and understand their needs. As rooms are in various shapes, sizes, and with different decor we were asked if we were happy with the room we had when we first saw it.   The room itself was very nicely decorated. We had elected to go for a room that had a small downstairs lounging area but in retrospect we should have taken a room with a single floor that had more space around the bed where we spent most of our in-room time anyway.   If one is looking for charging, warm place…"
November 2015,Wonderful hotel and welcome,"From the moment we arrived at the front door we were made to feel welcome and special at this delightful hotel which is both luxurious and full of character. Andrew and his team have thought of every detail (including, for my husband, a birthday cake and card!); it is those touches as well as the very high standards at The Milestone that make it such a wonderful place to stay.  Our stay was too short and we would love to return one day. JML and JML"
January 2016,1st Class,What a charming place to stay from the warm welcome at the entrance  and to all the staff in all departments  they really do make you feel special  rooms were spotlessly clean and tastefully furnished would sure use again.
September 2015,The previous reviews sum it all up,"Wanting a special hotel that would accommodate two relatively elderly people and a very pedantic 5 star traveler is always difficult. For trips to London, especially when wanting to visit the RAH, I have now found it. This is the standard that all other 5 star hotels in London should be striving for. A mixture of opulence, unobtrusive and subtly attentive service, every need catered for and a happy and relaxed environment. Together with the assumed immaculate cleanliness, calm atmosphere and superb rooms, this venue ticked all the boxes. My room service breakfast was prompt, warm and perfect (full English). I have written a separate review for the Restaurant where had our evening meal - excellent. If I wanted to be extra pedantic, the only moments when I felt a little extra…"
January 2016,Best boutique hotel,This hotel is a gem in a busy city. We stayed there for four nights with our teenage son.  We met a lot of interesting people who were guests including Jeff Bezos of Amazon!  Which my husband was thrilled about. The staff there are over the top amazing and caring.  The rooms are elegant and comfy.  We will stay here again as it is in a super location to Kensington palace.  
June 2015,Exceptional Service,We visited this hotel for dinner last week and was met with accommodating and friendly staff. We were running late and this was no problem for them which is rare in other London venues.  The meal was tremendous so huge compliments to the chef and in particular the cheesecake for dessert. The staff go above and beyond to ensure you are enjoying your experience and were attentive and conscientious with two staff Augustine and David deserving a special mention for their hospitality.   The atmosphere was warm and welcoming and the hotel design was beautifully decorated with attention to detail in all aspects.  We would recommend this luxurious hotel as it was such a memorable experience and in a great location too. Thank you for  a great evening.
January 2016,Fantastic!,"Me and my wife visited this hotel on the weekend to celebrate out anniversary.  From the moment we arrived, to the moment we checked out, we had a wonderful experience in this well deserved 5 star hotel.  The room was well equipped, immaculately clean and beautifully decorated, with a particular attention to every detail.  The butlers and staff were attentive, helpful and went out of their way to provide us with an enjoyable stay. In particular, I had the impression that the staff very much enjoy their job and actually DO want to assist, unlike other places we have visited.  Nothing was too much trouble for them and they really did care about our experience and comfort.  I would imagine that this hotel has a Michelin starred chef as the breakfasts were amazing, and the food…"
January 2016,A Wonderful Hotel in the heart of Kensington,"The Milestone hotel was truly the best hotel experience of my life. I was taking some special friends of mine for a weekend to London to watch the final Ashes Cricket Test match and while we enjoyed the spectacle ( despite and England defeat ), the icing on the cake was the hotel, its staff and wonderful ambience.  I cannot rate highly enough the people who looked after us during the weekend. From reception, to concierge, to restaurant and bar staff, everyone treated us like we were royalty. Next time, I will have the afternoon tea, the ambience of the drawing room is to die for !"
September 2015,Charming boutique hotel,This lovely boutique hotel across from Kensington Gardens does everything to make you feel welcomed. The employees are their #1 asset and we recommend this lovely hotel without reservation or hesitation.  The concierges are so helpful and accommodating. Well done Milestone!
September 2015,Snug comfort,"We did enjoy our stay at the lovely Milestone Hotel.   However, with no drawer  space and a tiny closet in our Deluxe Twin room, we found our requested AmEx upgrade unavailable, so we lived out of our suitcases for 10 nights in snug quarters.  The room, which faced the Kensington Gardens, was sound proof with absolutely effective blackout curtains.  The bed was firm and comfortable, and we appreciated the bottled water each night.  The bathroom had just enough space for his & her toiletries with a magnifying mirror and large, fluffy towels. The staff, without exception, is first rate and the public areas are charming.  One could not ask for more fresh and delicious breakfast choices in the small attractive restaurant and the coffee was great!   We did dine several evenings in…"
September 2015,Fantastic hotel in London,"My wife and I stayed here recently and very much enjoyed it. The staff were all very helpful and welcoming, we instantly felt at home when we arrived. Two nights after we arrived it was our anniversary, so I had emailed the concierge the week before to ask if he could book a table for us at a very desirable restaurant, which he did, and he got back to me straight away. Our room was very comfortable and quiet, and I especially enjoyed how they put some nice romantic music on for us every night during the turndown service. Breakfast every morning was very nice, and my wife had a treatment at the spa which she talked about for days after. The location was also excellent, just down the road from Kensington High Street Underground and across the road from Hyde Park. We have only been…"
October 2015,"Lovely, effortless luxury if one gets over the sticker shock","I had a lovely two-night stay at the Milestone Hotel in October, 2015. The overall impression was of apparently effortless luxury supported by a strong customer focus. The hotel gets the big and the little things right. The big: pleasant appearance, quiet rooms, a cozy interior feel, a superb location. Excellent wifi on all devices (no limits!). A comfortable bed made with high-end linens. Impeccably clean bathrooms stuffed with amenities – extra towels, extra shampoo and conditioner, drinking glasses galore – all items that have been shrunk or eliminated in even higher-end chain hotels. The little: toffees and other small welcome gifts placed by the bed at night. Free shoe shine. (Images are attached of the multiple electrical outlets and the laundry and shoe shine center in…"
September 2015,"Quintessentially British: charming, elegant and gracious","My opinion is a bit influenced by the room upgrade. That said, the physical facility is English at its most beautiful. It faces Kensington Gardens in Hyde Park. The food in the restaurant is superb, and we had several chances to judge that. Breakfast is fabulous. The staff is as gracious as they could be. Jose, the head concierge, was particularly helpful in securing a piano to rent. I suppose there are other wonderful boutique choices in London, but I have no need to experiment further."
September 2015,Nothing's changed except it has continued to be exceptional!,"Arrived "" home"" yesterday at the Milestone hotel. Had not been there in a little while but received such warm greetings from everyone with which we initially had contact. Maybe they remembered us and maybe they did not but it did not seem to matter in terms of how well they took care of us. The management and team at this hotel truly understand what it means to take exceptional care of their guests. We simply always love coming home to the Milestone. Hard to imagine that there is any other hotel in London that is better than the Milestone."
September 2015,Terrific Boutique hotel,"We recently stayed at the Milestone for three days while visiting London- While not the ideal location to see the main sites in the center of the city the Tube was only a 15 minute walk and very easy to get around. The hotel itself, while expensive, was worth it. The staff was gracious and helpful. We arrived late last Thursday and they served us dinner in the sitting room as the dining room was full and the  bar lounge was busy as well. Bedroom was very attractive. Only small complaint was the elevator recorded message regarding the floor as the door opened- not necessary and distracts from the quiet, and high class, ambiance of The Milestone.  Jack"
September 2015,Stayed for second time in September coming back this week  !,"My husband stayed for second time in September on a trip to visit Universities with my son. He stayed in the Safari Suite, (last time stayed in the apartments) , breakfast was excellent as before..and room was lovely ,. As he is going back this week will be interesting to see if everything remains excellent . I note that some reviewers have mentioned being upgraded on arrival , this has never happened to us even though we are returning customers which is a bit disappointing, will update this review after his stay, will be a great test of consistency! I expect they will continue to impress!!"
November 2015,Amazing experience,"My partner and I recently got engaged and booked a stay with this hotel to celebrate. The hotel staff were amazing and so helpful! In the evening we came back and our room (which was already beautiful) had been decorated in rose petals, candles, chocolates and strawberries. It was a lovely surprise and really made the trip special. Generally, the hotel is gorgeous. There is a resistance pool and sauna in the basement which, whilst small, was not very busy so it was nice to have it to ourselves. Oh, the complimentary hot chocolate is also a very yummy perk! We also ordered off the 24 hour room service and the food was still lovely. Generally, we are very grateful to the hotel for such a lovely stay."
November 2015,Wow!! Simply wonderful,"This Hotel is wonderful. The service, the rooms and all the special touches make this a wonderful hotel for anyone. We arrived with our nine years old son who absolutely loved it. The staff were so friendly, especially Georgia, they went out of their way to ensure that every request was catered for. The concierge took time to explain and book the attractions for us, we really didn't have to do anything ourselves. The hotel itself is fit for a King, just beautiful and the rooms are gorgeous. The breakfast was delicious and the afternoon tea, probably the best in London. Thanks you to all the staff who made this visit to London exceptional. We will definitely be back after Christmas, Thanks You."
November 2015,"Superb lunch, extraordinary service",Went to the Milestone for a celebratory lunch and was very impressed. Decor is excellent albeit that the first floor resembles a rabbit warren but the small dining room we used was warm and comfortable - perfect for our group.   I am always wary of mass catering but the food was first class and well presented.   Most impressive though was the service. There appeared to be more staff than guests all of whom were only too anxious to meet every need. All of them knew how to strike the perfect balance of friendliness and a pleasant chat if appropriate versus decorum and politeness.   I didn't stay at the hotel but on the impressions from lunch have no reason to doubt that this would be a luxurious experience. 
September 2015,The best hotel experience we've ever had! (and I don't say that lightly!),"This is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed out.  It's not just the room, it's the service, it's how the staff engage and operate, it's the little 'extras' along the way (think complimentary evening turn-down service, and mini scones delivered to your room and oh-so-much more).  They are catering to your experience and go out of their way to make sure you are looked after.  It's a high class hotel in every sense - beautifully detailed inside and out.  Even though our room wasn't large it had every convenience we needed, including international travel adapters, complimentary bottled water, and even high speed wifi internet.  The restaurant was exceptional.  We only had breakfast at the hotel (too busy sight seeing) but the food was cooked to perfection.  There were many…"
May 2015,Lovely place,we have a nice experience in this hotel last summer its a very cousy place easy to find it and the reception is fantastic the view pint is very accessible and practical for guest is a really lovely place
October 2015,Great experience!,"We had a great time at the Milestone Hotel and stayed 10 days total. The room was immaculate and attention to every detail was made. The turn down service with floating candle in the bath was just an added bonus in the evening after long days of sightseeing. Every morning we had delicious meals in the restaurant. We fell in love with Devon who waited on us each morning with a big smile and great suggestions on typical English dishes.   Andrea the Concierge gave us great suggestions on getting around town and on how to navigate the various venues. He arranged a play that was fabulous. Every restaurant he suggested was delicious.    Steven greeted us every morning with a smile,  held the door and sent us on our way. When we needed a umbrella he made sure we had it and all this…"
November 2015,Old world luxury & hospitality,"We luxuriated for 7 days in this unique, beautiful hotel overlooking Kensington Gardens. The staff are all exceptional, from the concierges to the skilled bartenders, the waiters to the doormen, and every friendly member of staff in between. Our spacious junior suite (Viscount) had green views and a jewel box interior. It was generously serviced twice a day with care and special luxury touches. The cream tea, cocktails, full English breakfast, dinner (room service and restaurant) were delicious. The experience was personal, care-full, and generous. It is old world, a little eccentric, warm and romantic. You really feel like a welcome guest here, from arrival to departure. An oasis in London. "
November 2015,Nice hotel,"Had a very nice stay lovely room very clean great staff nothing too much trouble. Breakfast slightly disappointing, (had in room) porridge was thick and stodgy inedible, bacon over cooked toast very hard. Overall a nice stay."
October 2015,Superb hotel - and excellent location,"We stayed at the Milestone for our Wedding Anniversary. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, and as we were running late they helped us up to our room quickly, plus provided 2 glasses of complimentary champagne in the room very quickly also.  The room was to a very high standard indeed, and the bed was amazingly comfortable. The breakfast was absolutely delicious - both the cooked options and the buffet selection were superb.  Best part about this hotel is that it is right on the corner of Kensington Gardens, so perfect for an early morning jog around Hyde Park - one of the best things to do on a Sunday morning.  We've stayed before together with 2 children, and a room overlooking the park - and the experience was superb then also."
February 2016,Brilliant!,"What amazing service, every single member of staff made us feel at home.  If you want a world class personal service the experience is worth every penny (if your paying for it!). Thank you to everyone including Andrew the general manager, you really do feel part of the family!"
February 2016,We just keep coming back!!,"I can't rate this hotel highly enough, everything about it from the second you arrive -is absolutely spot on! The staff are super friendly and nothing is too much trouble. The rooms are bright and airy , comfortable and there are loads of thoughtful extras that keep appearing during your stay! The bartender does a mean Bloody Mary too !! Highly recommend , you won't be disappointed!!"
February 2016,Fantastic stay in London ,"What a lovely stay in The Milestone hotel. Very friendly and welcoming staff! Great bar, restaurant and service. This time our stay was with our son of 8..... the hotel could not have been better for him and us! We will definitely stay there again!"
February 2016,Absolutely the best service we have ever experienced.,"This is the most incredible hotel we have ever stayed in, we will never consider another property in London again. The reason for this is the unbelievably attentive service from every single member of the team. From the second we arrived to the moment we left we were treated like royalty. Thank you so very much for the most wonderful night - we just wish it had been a longer visit but we will most certainly be back very soon."
January 2016,Quick layover in London...perfect service and all the comforts,"My daughter and I had a 12 hour overnight layover in London.  Instead of staying in one of the ""airport ""hotels he took the quick cab ride into town to stay at the Milestone.  They went a above and beyond to make sure we sere satisfied with everything. We ordered a late dinner and they brought the our ice cream later so it wouldn't melt while we enjoyed a delicious dinner first."
February 2016,Overnight stay at The Milestone Hotel - Wonderful,"My wife and I stayed at The Milestone Hotel on Saturday Feb 9th. It was booked as a celebration that also coincided with a Billy Connolly concert in London.  From the second we walked up the small number of steps to the hotel we were treated wonderfully well. The checking in process was done with a smile and a genuine interest in our trip. We were then offered a tour of the hotel. This covered its history, a viewing of the exquisite 'tea room' and an overview of the services available to us.  We like to walk and ventured around Hyde Park and the surrounding area. When we returned a selection of home baked biscuits and a lovely letter from the hotel was waiting for us.  In the evening we left for our concert. A great time was had (it was Billy Connolly after all!) and returned to…"
February 2016,Refined Elegant ,Wow! This was our final splurge in London after touring the UK and France for some six weeks. I could not think of a better way to finish our trip. From the moment you step on to the front steps you are made to feel special and welcomed. Not pretentious just a warm welcome from everyone that you encounter! The gentleman that showed us to our suite was magnificent! Our dining experience was beyond excellent. Truly a refined elegant decadent hotel! Can't wait for our return trip when we most certainly will be back. I would rate 5 star plus plus if it were available!
January 2016,Very nice hotel,"Spend 3 nights in end of January but just now have time to write the review. Hotel have great location , nice design . The room was clean, luxury. The food was good with good service. The staff is helpful with nice smile. We had a nice holiday, would like to come back again"
February 2016,Outstanding ,"Exceptionally friendly and helpful, smiling staff, who couldn't have made us feel more welcome. Fantastic food. Beautiful hotel. The complimentary champagne and other treats were a nice touch. Just loved it. So hope we can return. Thank you all at the milestone X"
November 2015,Nice stay,Our overall stay was nice.... Luxurious and lavish ...Good service and good food. The staff is very professional and have a good attitude towards guests. No bad experience at all... Great place for a getaway...
October 2015,Beautiful Hotel & Exceptional Customer Service,"This is a beautiful hotel in a great location on Kensington Gardens near the High Street tube station.  But, what makes this hotel beyond fantastic is the customer service.  The employees of The Milestone go out of their way to make you feel welcome and right at home.  Jose and Andrea at the concierge were incredibly helpful from giving us suggestions in the city to arranging exclusive dinner reservations prior to our arrival.  The staff is extremely friendly, and you can tell they take great pride in making your stay as enjoyable as possible.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Milestone and would definitely return."
October 2015,Apartments are phenomenal but the service is what makes this home!,"We booked here after a bad experience at St. Ermins caused us to flee to somewhere new so I did nothing more than a quick tripadvisor search.   What a gem!!! The service blows the doors off the Ritz, which says a lot. Every single staff member goes above and beyond. It's rather like staying with family or at an exceptional B&B. Upon checkin they upgraded is to an apartment, which I could easily spend a week in. Pedro is fantastic! from the front doormen to housekeeping, it's beyond top notch. Huge accommodations for the city, and every detail provided for. Gift pack for the kids, changed a lightbulb on the desk that Pedro noticed while showing us in. Even down to milk in the fridge for my son (I think they added it after hearing why we left St. Ermins. I was yelled at when I…"
September 2015,Simply perfect!,"I've stayed at a number of luxury hotels in Europe....Ritz in London and Paris, Villa d'Este. to name a few. I don't think I have ever been more comfortable and felt such a sincere welcome as I did recently at the Milestone Hotel in London. English charm at its finest, with no detail overlooked. Dining was superb, and the breakfast exceeded my expectations for such a relatively small, quaint hotel. The staff's personal attention had me in constant awe. Shear subtle elegance without the pompous formalities found in the larger 5 star hotels. I knew after the first night that I would never stay anywhere else in London anytime in the future. Reasonable rates with a 3rd night free through American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts. Simply perfect!"
October 2015,A Home in London,"Another wonderful homely experience at this gem of a hotel. We travelled with two friends to visit the Albert Hall (7 mins walk) for a show. It was our friends first visit to Milestone and they loved it just as much as we do. The overriding feeling you get is friendly charming staff who will offer to gladly help in any way they can. The training behind this brand must be first class and the staff selection is clearly picking the winners as personality shines through. If you have the chance enjoy a long relaxing afternoon tea in the lounge with a glass (proper measure) of Moët Chandon which appears to be the house wine! Breakfast was lovely, we enjoyed the complimentary coffee and tea that I'd delivered to guest as they chose...... No silly room kettles in this hotel! We love the…"
September 2015,Lovely stay!,"We visited for 5 nights and had a truly lovely experience.  From reception to dining to concierge: the staff is wonderful!  We felt relaxed and ""at home"" immediately. Dinner was fabulous at the restaurant and again, the service was impeccable. Loved coming back in the evening and sit by the piano.The location is also perfect."
October 2015,Phenomenal experience,"From the moment we entered the lobby until the moment we checked out, we felt immediately at ease and home away from home.  The attention to service is without fault.  We were traveling with our two teenage daughters, so we booked two separate rooms.  Both rooms were well appointed, bright, roomy & comfortable.  There is a nightly turn-down and tidy service provided at no additional charge.   The rooms have heavy drapes which can be pulled across the windows, eliminating street noise & offending light.  My favorite perk was the professional blowdryer, not one of those horrid things screwed into the bathroom wall...no, this is the real-deal, low noise ionic high velocity hairdryer.  I'm telling you ladies, I was temped to place it in my luggage, it was that nice.  If you have…"
October 2015,Superb Stay!,"Stayed here one night attending a concert at the Royal Albert Hall, a short walk from the hotel.  This delightful hotel is the epitome of a very upmarket traditional English Town House. Friendly, welcoming staff, very comfortable bed room, with large bathroom - 2 basins and a large bath, with luxury bath products.  The one slight disappointment was the lack of tea/coffee making facilities in the room.  Breakfast - what can be said?  The attention to detail was outstanding, down to the individual crudites, and the best cooked English breakfast ever.  Amazing!"
October 2015,RWC 2015,"My third visit and as always brilliant! The room, the service, the restaurant and the bar, superb and without fault. Such a pleasure to be in a great location with everything you could ask for and much more. We will be back and can't wait, such an inviting yet luxurious hideaway in the heart of Kensington."
October 2015,A Gem by the Park,"I never heard of the hotel before this. My travel agent mentioned it to me and I was slightly skeptical. I will never question my travel agent again. It is one of a kind. I felt that I was living in an English Manor. The service was impeccable along with rooms that are so well done.  Forget all the big expensive hotel when you go to London. I felt like I was staying with some friends in London and not in a hotel. The location is great. You are right across the street from Kensington Gardens and close by to Notting Hill,Chelsea and Knightsbridge. They have a very charming bar in the lobby and a great place for a spot of tea.  This is one of the greatest finds of the year."
October 2015,Absolutely wonderful!,"Spent 9 days surrounded by the best service in London, luxurious accommodations and the finest staff of professionals you'll find anywhere. No request too big, no detail too small is a motto they live by 24/7.  They were all one step ahead in anticipating any need.  We'll be back!  "
July 2015,Perfect hotel experience,"We stayed at the Milestone in early July for one week. We had two rooms, one a junior suite and were impressed and delighted by all that we experienced.Though Wimbleton was in full swing and the hotel completely booked, you never had the sense that it was crowded. We were seated promptly for a delicious breakfast daily with the surprise that a la carte choices were included in the price of the buffet. We often had afternoon cream teas in the Conservatory which were a wonderful way to unwind after a day of sightseeing. We ended each evening with a nightcap in the charming little bar. Every staff member we encountered provided nothing short of excellent service. Bellmen, servers, front desk, housekeeping were all professional and dedicated to their craft. The Concierge desk was…"
September 2015,Superb Stay,"We booked our room at the Milestone Hotel through Costco travel and it was one of the best picks ever.  The hotel service was excellent and our concierge, Andrea, was extremely helpful.  He helped us confirm our Golden Tours reservation and ensure that we knew where to go to catch the hop-on bus.  During our check in, one of the staff, Nick, give us a tour of the hotel. It truly is a beautiful property with lots of history.    The food was excellent.  Through our Costco package, each day we got the full breakfast, which also included the continental breakfast items (see pictures).  Everything I ordered was delicious (i.e. waffle, french toast, and souffle pancakes).  We also had dinner at the hotel and that was also really good.    When we return to London, we will definitely…"
September 2015,Outstanding stay in a magnificent hotel.,"This is a wonderful hotel with high standards. The service was exceptional, the whole hotel is extremely well looked after and the deluxe studio room was a total delight. If I must mention the slight problems they are: the sockets for plugs are few and hard to find, usually behind furniture which cannot be moved, making it difficult to use the kettle and the hairdryer; the breakfast is good but not exceptional given the high quality of the rest of the hotel, for instance there was no honey available; the lounge and bar are extremely pleasant but small and so soon crowded. If you can put up with these minor issues then there is nothing else to worry about! They look after you superbly and although this is an expensive hotel it is clearly one of the top hotels in London. If you…"
September 2015,A perfect hotel for a truly English experience ,"This is a great hotel across the street from Kensington park. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  Every room is different with great attention to detail. The hotel has an old style English decor, which makes it even more special.  Breakfast was delicious and the dining room very cozy. There is also a unique little bar downstairs which is cozy and a perfect place to end the day. "
August 2015,Magnificent Milestone makes me merry,"Warm, embracing staff and hotel with excellent location, great food, and more smiles than you expect in London. Don't miss the chance to smile back!    Rooms are beautifully appointed, bathroom amenities of the highest quality (Penhaligon was always my favorite) and lovely restaurant with fairly priced food and wine. Uber cool bar with enclosed gazebo feel for before or after!  Could be the Nike hotel:  just do it.   Great spot for Proms a few blocks away. "
August 2015,A Five-Carat Gem,"With tentative expectations for The Milestone, we were absolutely blown away by the boutique oasis.  The attention to detail given by every single member of the Milestone's staff never ceased.  The moment we were delivered by our driver, I knew that this was going to be special.  As the doorman greeted me, he requested my name and he never failed to use our name when addressing us.  We were greeted by reception and quickly escorted to our beautifully appointed guest room suite.  Every single detail was considered for our junior suite.  We were even provided with business cards that included our name.  To add to our wonderful experience, the hotel has an amazing restaurant and parlor for proper English tea.  The restaurant, Cheneston's, has a wonderful menu, outstanding food…"
August 2015,4 days at the Milestone,"An excellent hotel with all the amenities with a great location across the street from Kensington Park and Palace.  Also, close to the tube making it easy to get around. The room at the hotel was good sized and very clean.  Every day we found little gifts like tea and candy.  We had breakfast included with our stay and we were able to either have room service or go to the dining room.  The entire staff at the hotel seemed to try to go out of their way to be helpful, but we really want to thank the concierges Andrea and Jose who we're always very helpful and had great personalities.  We would like to go back to London and we would definitely stay at the Milestone."
July 2015,The Best of Kensington,"After spending two weeks traveling through England, Wales, Spain and Belgium, we decided to add three days in London. A friend recently stayed at the Milestone and gave it high marks, so we decided to walk in and see if there were any available rooms. We were greeted at the reception by a very helpful young woman who did an excellent job fitting us with the right room. After collecting our baggage, we were given a nice tour of the property ending in our room. I wont say the room number...but we think we got the best room in the hotel. Without too much detail, this hotel could do no wrong. The service: exceptional, the room: better than being at home, the food: some of the best we ate on the whole trip (they even were able to have menus specific for my wife's allergies). From the…"
July 2015,excellent,"This is a great location so walking was was a good option to several areas.  The staff goes above and beyond to make the guests feel like family.    The staff handled everything with sincerity and professionalism.  The restaurants are amazing, food is exceptional and the decor so inviting. The room where afternoon tea was served was attractive and comfortable, the food was more than sufficient in quantity, was wide in variety, and was very good in quality, the tea remained at the right temperature, and the service was excellent. The rooms are comfortable and each one is uniquely decorated in styles that make you want to visit all of them. I highly recommend over nighting at The Milestone Hotel."
May 2015,PLEASURE ISLAND,"I found this hotel purely by chance some years ago when attending an event at the Royal Albert Hall and having suffered grievously from the dire accommodation and non-existent service of an hotel much closer to the venue.  I have never looked back and stay at this place for both business and pleasure trips to London.  The staff are excellent, without exception, the bar is quirky and comfortable, the rooms are havens of respite and the food very good (the menu being underpinned by some long standing favourites of the founder)."
April 2015,fantastic,"The reason I pick Milestone because it is great old hotel. I was there for 3 night and couldn't have gone better. The room was so good and comfy, the staffs were very helpful 24/7. Me and my mom particular like the bar and the cocktails there were amazing. I will stay here again when i back"
June 2015,Service second to none.,This was our first time in London and our stay at the Milestone could not have gone better. The staff were so cordial and accommodating from our arrival and throughout our stay. We particularly enjoyed our room and hight tea. We also were served very well in their bar. We would highly recommend this hotel and staff. We will stay there again when we return.
July 2015,wonderful,"The hotel is a grand old building, but very well maintained and absolutely spotlessly clean.The reception desk staff were so polite, helpful and interested in where we were from and our reasons for the stay etc.  Offering different services including help with restaurant choicesAll in all it was a superb experience.The room where afternoon tea was served was attractive and comfortable, the food was more than sufficient in quantity, was wide in variety,  and was very good in quality, the tea remained at the right temperature, and the service was excellent.  Everyone was extremely friendly, courteous and went above and beyond on attention to detail.  After a quick and very personal check in we were led to our lovely room, the lady that scorted us went into full detail explaining…"
August 2015,Closer to a three star than the third best hotel in London ...,"I am a big fan and devotee of Trip Advisor (I never book without consulting it) and am shocked that this hotel is rated third in London for five star accommodations. Hotel location is great and the staff couldn't be nicer BUT our suite was incredibly cramped and felt tired and dingy.    In some ways, this feels more like a B&B than a grand hotel.  We had booked interconnecting rooms as we were traveling with our kids but got ""upgraded"" to an apartment. Clean enough rooms with renovated bathrooms. The master bathroom was so small the door had to be completely open to slide in.  There was barely room to make it around the bed and not enough space for our very minimal luggage.  In part, we choose this hotel based on the amenities of a pool and fitness center - both big…"
August 2015,Superb!,"We had the stay of a lifetime. It oozes luxury and sophistication.Tremendous facility and staff. Old-style English catering to your every wish or need. 5 stars in every category you could imagine. Food/drink were perfect. Bar staff were very knowledgeable and introduced me to different cocktails. Rooms quiet and richly appointed. We never felt crowded or rushed. The concierge crew of Andrea, Josh, and Jose were beyond helpful and made our daily journeys easy, and effortlessly obtained desired tickets to football matches, palace tours, and shows."
August 2015,"Love this hotel, wouldn't stay anywhere else in London","Whenever in London we always stay at the Milestone.  The building is beautiful and in a great location.  The staff are exceptional, friendly and helpful without being over the top.  Breakfast is yummy.... Try the new veggie option,  Can't find a single fault with this fab place."
August 2015,Fabulous ....,"The Milestone hotel provides a luxuary feel and homelike feeling the attention to detail colours and furniture are warm and inviting the staff are courteus respectful helpful and very accommodating.Our experience with Jonathan concierge and  Katie at the reception desk need a special mention both of them are absolutely professional warm and insightful they made our stay at the hotel complete. Kind Regards, Izabella "
August 2015,Very disappointing,"Some of their rooms are VERY dated.  The front desk clerk at check in was very nice, we tried changing rooms and each room was dated and small.  That evening I asked if we could upgrade for the following night , I was told that it would cost me 500 additional GBP on top of the 400 I was already paying!!! REALLY !!! I went to the room and the front desk clerk called me and said he looked at my reservation and he could do for an additional 300.00 GPB. At this point it was so insulting that we called Leading Hotels and cancelled the rest of our stay and went to The Ritz for a lot less . This hotel is small cramped, and rooms outdate.  The robe in the room had a big hole in it.  We couldn't get out of there fast enough. Don't do it ! They are so many great hotels in London and this…"
July 2015,"Fabulous Hotel, Excellent Service, Highlight of Our Vaction","We stayed at the Milestone at the beginning of a 3 week trip that included many different hotels throughout England and the top favorite of everyone in our party was the Milestone.  We were an extended family of 7 traveling with members ranging in age between 10 and 74.  There was something for everyone at this hotel but the thing that stood out the most was the service.   The staff goes above and beyond to make the guests feel like family.  We truly felt that we were the only guests in the hotel.  From the concierges Josh and Andrea taking care of every little thing, even going so far as to offer to give us their favorite pen, to the breakfast staff asking about how our prior day was, what our plans for the day are and having our breakfast ready before we even asked because…"
July 2015,Family of 4 plus grandmother- terrific stay,We had a great stay in Apartment 1. Very cozy and comfortable.  Had a spiral staircase which with bedrooms downstairs- was a little taxing on my mother n law but she managed just fine. Didn't know that before arrival. Having the apartment was wonderful so we could all be together. The breakfast each morning was wonderful. The staff was great. The cleaning staff did an excellent job but would put our things in cabinets/drawers so we would have to search a little- but did a great job otherwise.  The apartments are great for the space but were quite pricey. Great location. Whole Foods a couple of blocks down. Wonderful having washer n dryer but the dryer takes far longer to dry than American machines so it took forever to keep laundry of 5 going. Glad we stayed. This is a high end…
June 2015,Amazing hotel!,"What a surprising treat.  My children (5 and 9 years old) and I stayed at the Milestone during our first visit to London this summer. It was recommended by American Express and although I'd lived in London a while back, I'd never heard of it. I've been raving about it ever since! Everything was beyond perfection. We arrived early and they offered us a temporary room until ours was ready. We napped, showered, and were ready for an afternoon of exploring. Our permanent room was beautiful & luxurious - they even included robes & slippers for the kids. Restaurant recommendations were spectacular, with special care for our food allergies. The doorman gave us bread to feed the birds in Kensington Gardens one day. Afternoon tea was an experience not to be missed. Breakfast was…"
September 2015,Not quite as good second and third time around,"We stayed at this Hotel back in 2011. We were delighted with the Milestone back in 2011 and without hesitation thought we would stay here again on this trip to the UK. We stayed here in August and September so this review covers both visits. A number of issues occurred during our stay that singularly may not have amounted too much but annoyances kept occurring. On check-in , the porter arrived with the baggage and the birthday cake - my partners birthday was two days later. When I told the porter that it wasn't the birthday, he still persisted I should accept the cake and begrudgingly walked away mumbling perhaps we can freeze it. I noted on our itinerary the the travel agent had noted the correct date of my partners' birthday, I noted that a box of tea had been left as a gift…"
September 2015,Fabulous Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for three nights in September, 2015.  From the moment we arrived by car to leaving for the airport to come home, we has FABULOUS service.  The check in desk had our reservation ready with the most professional gentlemen welcoming you to the hotel by name.  We were shown to our room quickly with the luggage arriving almost before we got to the room.  We ate dinner in the lovely hotel restaurant the first night and had breakfast every morning and all meals were excellent, with the same terrific service.  We had a small problem with a cell phone and the concierge was most helpful in solving the problem.  Everyone from the doorman to service personnel were helpful, cheery and very professional.  I would highly recommend this hotel for any London visitor who…"
August 2015,Hardest Review to Write - Ever!,I have struggled more with this review than any other before. It absolutely should be 5 stars. If it was based on staff alone it would be 50 stars for absolute certainty. So where to begin? I am just wondering why I can't give it 5 stars so let me start with the positives. Every single member of staff we encountered - as we experienced last year in their sister hotel in Geneva - was world class. You could put any member of staff in any Red Carnation Hotel into any other hotel on the planet and they would stand out as the very best without doubt. The location of the hotel is excellent - especially as we were attending a concert in the Royal Albert Hall which is within easy walking distance. The deal that we got for our two night stay via the American Express Fine Hotels and…
August 2015,Fabulous Wedding Anniversary stay!!,"As I am writing this review, I am feeling very sad....and that's because me and my husband felt totally heartbroken to leave this splendid hotel yesterday! So want to go back! I booked this hotel for a weekend away to celebrate our 23rd wedding anniversary and it was a complete surprise for my husband! From the moment we got to the steps of this gorgeous hotel, they treated us like royalty! Nothing was to much! They very kindly upgraded us to a suite called Mistinguett which was beautiful and had it's only private balcony. We had lunch in the lovely bar area, which was delicious and we were treated to champagne!  I booked my husband a massage which he enjoyed very much. The facilities in the suite and the hotel are second to none!! Utterly First Class in every way! Really felt…"
August 2015,Classy ,"The Milestone Hotel is a wonderful boutique hotel for those who are looking for comfort, style and culture.  In search of a restorative place to stay in London, I felt led to The Milestone.  And thank God I was!  The hotel's posh design has a classic and homie feel. Upon arrival I immediately felt relaxed. Although there were a few kinks with my room that had to be worked out, I don't hold it against them. The staff handled everything with sincerity and professionalism. They were one of the best parts about staying here; helpful, prompt and always addressed me by name.  Which is much better than staying in a fancy big name hotel where you are ""just a number.""  If you are traveling solo, with your partner or family, I highly recommend overnighting at The Milestone Hotel.   By the…"
August 2015,Poshly Perfecto!,"I mean the title in a total lovely way!   My family and I have been applied rotten by the staff.  What a perfect mix of helpful and being allowed your own space.  Everyone is so friendly and I have to say, Fran the Butler is really, well, BRILLIANT!   He surprised our family with getting us an even bigger room so my little guy could have space.  Management - make sure Fran gets a raise please!  :)))  Location is spectacular - I mean you are literally down the road from Kensington Palace and there are plenty of spots to eat.  Now, if you are a bit health conscience like I am, you will be pleased to know that a Whole Foods is 5 minutes away and it has a great food court too!  Personally, I now know why this is voted number 1 on Tripadvisor.  now all you have to do is experience it…"
July 2015,Epitome of Elegance,"From the moment you enter you know you are in a very special place. All service is extremely polished and warm. They have a very international staff. You really do feel like you're in someone's elegant townhouse---which this once was. Two townhouses actually. We must thank our travel expert who is affiliated with Virtuoso because we received additional amenities, a very nice room upgrade and chauffeur service to our final destination in London. This hotel and it's staff provided a serene retreat from the noisy crowded bustle of London. Would highly recommend it without exception."
July 2015,"Gentlemen's afternoon tea at The Milestone Hotel, London","A family tradition and indulgence is afternoon tea at four or five star hotels. My wife and I, with various family members, have had very good experiences around the world. However, the Gentlemen's afternoon tea at The Milestone Hotel in London was the best I have had in a long time. The room where afternoon tea was served was attractive and comfortable, the food was more than sufficient in quantity, was wide in variety, and was very good in quality, the tea remained at the right temperature, and the service was excellent. All in all it was a superb experience. Thank you to David who served us, and to my daughter Rhiannon for taking me and her mother."
June 2015,3 Wonderful Days at The Milestone Hotel,"Everything was GREAT from Check In through Check Out. Everyone was extremely friendly, courteous and went above and beyond on attention to detail. After a quick and very personal check in we were led to our lovely room, the lady that scorted us went into full detail explaining all the room amenities. Everyday we had some sort of delicacy from the hotel chef to enjoy at evenings. Every morning our breakfast was beyond formidable, both a la carte, or buffet, waiters at the restaurant were always marvelous and extremely attentive. Hotel surroundings are beautiful, across the street from Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. I can't really find or say anything below wonderful! We wish could spent some more time in this wonderful city and this wonderful hotel."
July 2015,"Gerald Negvesky, MD","The Milestone is an absolute London Gem!  A close sophisticated friend who frequents London from the U.S. recommended it to us.  My family of 5 spent 9 nights in July....Simply Spectacular!  Accommodations are elegant, location is prime( best in London), staff is attentive and graceful.  The culture of the Milestone is that of pure excellence in hospitality.  Entire staff was wonderful, however, Jose and Andrea in concierge and Grant in dining, were among the best in service that we have ever experienced.  The Milestone made each of us feel like Royalty.  We are already planning our return trip next Summer."
July 2015,Lovely in London but something just off,"Please, I don't consider this four star rating a negative at all.  It is a lovely old hotel in Kensington adjacent to the Kensington Palace and Hyde Park, a great, relatively quiet, convenient location in London.  The rooms are nice and excellently appointed in the old city style.  The restaurant was small, but stylish and had excellent service.  The bar was a beautiful, wood paneled and brass railed room with a horse racing theme.  An excellent place to decompress and relax after a day in London.  Where the Milestone really excelled was the service throughout.  Special kudos to Benny at the front desk, Andrea the concierge, Fabrizio, the restaurant manager, and Emmanuel the sommelier.  That being said, after having stayed at other Red Carnation properties, something here just…"
July 2015,Lovely Afternoon Tea at the Milestone Hotel,"We recently had the pleasure of enjoying afternoon tea at the Milestone Hotel in London. We thought it would be an enjoyable experience, but it far exceeded our expectations. The Park Lounge was a lovely setting, and the service was amazing from start to finish.   Once we were seated, our server asked what kinds of teas we liked, made recommendations, and poured our tea. It was delicious! In fact, our 19 year old son declared that it was the best tea that he’d ever tasted and the staff was kind enough to send him off with some to enjoy at home.  Our sandwiches and desserts were next, and they were superb! The presentation was spectacular, and we ate far more than we should have. After having had our fill of finger sandwiches, meringue lollipops, cupcakes with  wonderful passion…"
June 2015,miestone to the albert hall,we have stopped at the milestone at Christmas and when we visit the royal albert hall such as Christmas sing alongs and seeing don mclain it is so convinent to get to and fro it has wonderful facilities & great staff & food
September 2015,What a fantastic Hotel,"What a great hotel in London will definitely be returning when next in the UK.  The service here is excellent, without exception every member of staff I encountered was first class.   In a city where most hotel visits your left disappointed feeling you've overpaid for something mediocre the Milestone really stands out.   Room was a good size, well equipped and very comfortable bed."
September 2015,What a wonderful hotel!!,"Top notch service, the best of the best!!! From check in to check out- not one issue!!!  We have wonderful memories of the lounge, restaurant etc., that we will fondly remember for always. The staff is incredible, they really go out of their way to please!! A true 5 star hotel. What a pleasure. Close to the Underground,,buses and across fro Kensington Palace. Great location."
September 2015,Could Hardly Wait to Return,"We visited London's Milestone Hotel a couple of years ago and gave it top ratings.  So much so, we could not wait to return which we did earlier this week for 3 fantastic days and nights.  I don't know how they could have exceeded our expectations, but Andrew Pike (GM) And his team did it again.  From our greeting with Patricio at the front door to Joshua and the other great concierges to the entire staff.  Our dinner was highlighted by Augustino and breakfasts by Food and Beverage manager Fabrizio.  We are already planning our next visit!  Thanks to the entire staff for making my birthday so memorable."
September 2015,Another Great Stay,"This is the third time we have stayed at the Milestone.  Our stay was delightful starting from the moment we arrived and were welcomed by the warm and efficient staff.  Our early morning flight meant that we arrived tired and hungry.  By the time we had had a delicious breakfast in the hotel dining room our very comfortable two level suite (an Upgrade!) was ready.  We like the location of this hotel.  It is within easy walking distance of the tube and there is an ATM on the way. It is well situated to visit the south Kensington museums.  The hotel itself is very lovely and each room is different.  But it is the staff who make The Milestone a hidden gem.  The concierge, the front desk, the doormen, the dining room - everyone was friendly, helpful and efficient.  We hope to return…"
September 2015,Charming doesn't even begin to describe the Milestone.,We didn't stay at the Milestone but spent an afternoon enjoying the Gentlemen's Tea.  It was a delightful experience and the Hotel couldn't be more charming if it tried. The interiors are exacting what you would picture the nicest English Manor house to look like and we were enchanted with every detail.   In a word the Gentlemen's Tea was perfection. 
August 2015,Wonderful Stay,"Excellent location (close to Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, Royal Albrt Hall, shopping, and underground station..). Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Lovely furniture. Romantic.  No tea and coffee making facilities in the room"
July 2014,Amazing,"Great food, great location, great breakfast, great rooms, great staff. As you have gathered by now this place is great!!!! Seriously, I could not remember something to fault them for.  The restaurant in the hotel is quite pricey but it is a real fine dining experience, I recommend you try it."
June 2015,60th Birthday Treat,"My girlfriend treated me to a wonderful London trip and we stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate my 60th birthday. It is, without question one of the best hotels we have been to. A beautiful, elegant building in a great location. All of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Our room was amazing. The English cooked breakfast was the best ever. There was even a home made chocolate birthday cake in our room upon arrival! We will certainly stay here again. Highly recommend."
June 2015,Good Taste of London,"Great service, great location. Staff was very welcoming on arrival. Size of room adequate for three. Excellent breakfast and had great dinner. About a 12 minute walk from the Underground, near Whole Foods and near the Parks. Highly recommend this hotel."
June 2015,Delightful stay,"Stayed here for the first week of June. Could not have had a more delightful stay at any hotel. They made us feel like one of the family in their home. The hotel is like an old sophisticated Kensington manor house. Everyone from the Doormen, reception, management, Concierge, Bar and restaurant staff and housekeeping were the best ever.  Breakfast was amazing, the Stables Bar was the best ever. They gave us many non-tourist suggestions for places to see and great local eateries. You must try Fiona's a few blocks for the hotel."
August 2014,First Stop London,"This is a much overdue review of The Milestone.  What an absolutely wonderful experience.  My daughter and I took a trip of a lifetime last August.  London, Paris and Rome.  Our first stop, London.  AmEx helped make all of our arrangements and we chose The Milestone based on the tripadvisor reviews.  Last year The Milestone was ranked number 1, has fallen to number 2.  But I can't possibly imagine what the staff could have done better.  Congenial, comfortable and safe.  Not too far from the Tube."
May 2015,Outstanding Service and Elegant Location for Afternoon Tea,"While vacationing in London, I took my 4 year old granddaughter to the ""Little Princess"" afternoon tea at The Milestone Hotel.  From the moment we entered the hotel, all staff members we came in contact with were extremely friendly, kind and professional.  Each person gave special attention to my granddaughter and definitely made her feel as if she were a real princess.  Midway through our tea, she was presented with her own personal chef's apron and taken to a special dining room to decorate her very own yummy cupcake with their assistance.    We were seated in the cozy library close to the main lobby.  It was very tastefully  decorated and provided a comfortable setting.  We received outstanding service during our two hour tea time and tea and hot chocolate were kept refilled…"
June 2015,Nice choice,"Nice location for those who wish to avoid too  much racket and bustle. Nice service, as soon as you don't have (too) young receptionist on the day of arrival. Clean and comfortable, nicely decorated Deluxe suite, but the  cigarettes' smell that comes out of bathroom is unpleasant. The light snacks in the bar, well... This is less than nice. needs reassessment and refreshment. Good wifi, nice evening pianist in romantic and warm atmosphere."
May 2015,Ultimate pet friendly hotel,Great hotel to stay at if you have pets. We stayed one night with our dog and the staff were super welcoming.  Good location for doggy walks over the road in the park. Rooms are a bit busy for my liking and rather on the small size but very comfortable.
June 2015,Amazing afternoon tea,"I took my four and five year old girls to afternoon tea here and it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. The setting was very elegant and fitting for our Princess tea. Our waiter was amazing. He treated the girls like adults, gave them menus to read and just let them pretend they were grown ups. The food sandwiches, cakes and scones were delicious but far too much. I felt terrible that we left so much although they offered to box up my left overs for me. Overall it was a wonderful way to spend an afternoon and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
May 2015,Perfect on every level,"Brilliant location for getting about  some of the smarter areas of London as well as a few miles from some of the main attractions. The hotel was very luxurious in its service, its decor and its facilities - and when we had a problem with the room the manager just got it done with no fuss and minimum disruption or inconvenience. We had both the dinner and breakfast in the hotel and the quality was excellent - would recommend to anyone"
June 2015,Loved Everything,"We stayed 6 nights in June at the Milestone Apartments (apt#1) We are a family of 4 with kids 7 and 11.  We LOVED the Milestone.  Everyone was very nice but still professional  (especially Steven at the door).    The apartment was super roomy and cozy.  It had 2 bedrooms, 2 1/5 baths, lovely sitting room, and a very functional kitchen.  We didn't eat at the apartment as much as I thought we would...but it was nice to have.  We used the washer and dryer every day.      The location was perfect with two parks with great playgrounds nearby, lots of dining options, and a tube station a few minutes away.  The M&S food hall was a good spot for some prepared foods.      Our room rate came with breakfast and it was delicious every day.  It was funny how they interpreted chocolate chip…"
August 2014,"Nice,but not again","Stayed last summer with family. The hotel is very conveniently located, but is small and dated IMO. The service was excellent overall, we did receive a call one night from a woman at the front desk telling us of a complaint of noise from some other guests. I explained there was no one in our room and I had just come down the hall and heard the phone, she was rude and told me to keep it down anyway.  Lots of American tourists here, thanks to Trip Advisor and other lists. The excellent reviews on TA swayed us to try this hotel, but I would likely not choose it again without it having some major renovation."
June 2015,Perfect London Hotel,"I have stayed in London on two other occasions vacationing. The Milestone was by far the best. A beautiful property.  So refined!  The staff always went ""the extra mile"" to accommodate  us. The doorman was always cheerful. The concierge staff  helped us with travel plans. The check in and out went so smoothly.  Reception staff so friendly and efficient.  Also the food is great. We ate all our meals at the hotel because it was so delicious.  When I retuned to the US I realized that I left my IPad in my hotel room. I called them and they said no problem we will send it to you. I had my IPad back within the week!  This is the best hotel in London. You will be extremely satisfied!"
July 2015,Top hotel,"Stayed here for the first time recently on business. The hotel is one of the best in the area, service is next to none - all staff very accommodating and attentive. The hotel is a grand old building, but very well maintained and absolutely spotlessly clean...cleaners seem to work very hard with great care.  Restaurant food amazing..... Was only a flying visit, but am looking to come back soon for a stay with my partner."
July 2015,"Amazing Service, Wonderful Staff, Great Location!!!","My husband and I just arrived home from staying at The Milestone for one night in London.  We had stayed at another hotel for four nights, then went out to the country and needed a hotel for our last night back in London.  We normally stay at branded luxury hotels that we are familiar with, but I really wanted to try something different.  I am so glad I did.  We had a fabulous stay and loved our room.  The best part was the staff, the are so attentive and can't do enough for the guests.  The service is equal to or better than any luxury 5 star branded hotel.  Thank you very much Milestone Staff.   You all are wonderful."
June 2015,Best Hotel Ever!,"When we arrived from the airport via taxi, the doorman greeted us by our name. From then on, everyone in the hotel did the same. It was the most amazing service we have ever encountered. This and the fact that the hotel itself is very unique, in that every room is different. The restaurant is excellent, we dined every morning for breakfast and twice for dinner. Again, impeccable service. There is a small, cozy bar as well. We asked for a balcony for our room, and we had a large veranda with tables and chairs, plants, etc. If you are travelling to London, you have to stay here!"
July 2015,Perfection:  Truly Exceptional Service,"We just spent a week at the Milestone with my 86 year old mother, 6 year old daughter and 16 year old son.  Our party stayed in two rooms.    The staff at the Milestone are truly exceptional from the doormen, to the front desk, to the concierges (thank you Jose and Andrea) and the room attendants.  All have a friendly, can-do attitude and quickly address their guests by name.  Throughout the property you will find minute attention to details making the Milestone a quintessential, bespoke, traditional English hotel.  While steeped in tradition, the hotel includes modern details such as flat screen TVs,  wifi throughout the property, a sauna gym and resistance pool. The Kensington location worked well for our daily outings, and the hotel is right across the street from prince…"
August 2014,Fabulous location and Outstanding service.,Been to many hotels throughout London every time I went. This may be one of the best Hotels in London that grants one of the best luxurious experience. I can't think of a better hotel throughout London.
July 2015,Memories Made Milestone,Ultimate intimate luxury boutique hotel with views of Kensington. Last stayed here 8 years ago prior to most recent visit a week ago. Timeless- the staff from doorman to desk to servers are the absolute best at anticipating and meeting guests needs. Even with teenagers! Close to neighborhood restaurants and shopping in addition to a few touristy spots. Private tours of Kensington can be arranged as it is right out the front door. Thank you Jose!
June 2015,Fantastic place to stay,Me my Wife and Daughter booked a 1 night stay at this prestigious hotel as a treat for our Daughters Birthday as she was going to see Lady Ga Ga and Tony Bennett at the Royal Albert Hall we arrived just after lunch and had booked afternoon tea we were so well looked after nothing was too much trouble the food was delicious the service was top notch the rooms that we had were of the highest standard and everything you needed for a comfortable stay was catered for all in all a great place to stay its a bit pricey but you get what you pay for I would recommend this hotel to anybody
May 2015,Another superb visit to my other home,"I visited the Milestone for the second time in May and it was just as lovely and charming as before.  I have to give a huge thanks to Katie, Ilsa, Kasey, Nik, Josh, Jose, Bruce, Fran, oh my....too many to name. From Katie's assistance with moving my belongings from one room to another, after a slightly less than graceful dismount from my tub, to her smiling face when you arrived back from sightseeing. Bruce telling me where to get the best Chinese, then ordering it and bringing it to me. Josh telling me about comic con and helping print out tickets for several different events. Jose helping me report my lost camera. Fran helping me with my misbehaving TV. Kasey's ever present smile and humor. The rest of the reception staff for providing water and advice, the room service staff…"
June 2015,A must if ever visiting London,"Had the absolute pleasure of spending a night at the fantastic Milestones during our last visit to London. If you are looking for service and quality look no further! With it's great location you can enjoy fairytale views of the enchanting Kensington Palace - be sure to book a room facing Hyde Park! The style and interior design is breathtaking and you feel as if entering another decade upon check-in. Upon our arrival we were shown in to the Stables Bar where we were kindly offered welcome drinks and snacks. During our drinks Mr. Fran O'Hanlon, one of three wonderful dedicated butlers, retold the history of the property and once we've finished our drinks he gave us a tour of the rest of the Hotel. During this conversation I mentioned breafly that I was very interested in the…"
June 2015,Afternoon Tea,"Our experience of afternoon tea at The Milestone Hotel could not have been better. It was a sixtieth birthday family celebration, including two young children, and the staff were extremely accommodating, both when booking and on the afternoon itself. The children thoroughly enjoyed their cupcake decorating experience, dressed in chefs aprons, and the adults were extremely appreciative of the delicious food! Our waitress was charming and attentive and, although not cheap, the overall experience was worth every penny."
June 2015,This place is NOT over rated,"I was a little skeptical at the highest rating and had to try it.   The service is perfect - so attentive, the rooms are so detailed and unique, the breakfast is delicious and the tea time is the best I have had.  I'm so happy I choose this place and highly recommend booking through Amex as your get a ton of perks."
May 2015,Quintessential London,"If you had a fantasy of what the perfect London hotel would be, this is it!  My daughter and I stayed for 3 nights in May and it was not long enough.  Truly a highlight of our extended European holiday.  Perfect location, beautiful property and superb staff. Look for Steven the doorman.  He's awesome. Great breakfast, tea, and fast room service.  A Five star all the way"
May 2015,"Fabulous location, fabulous team","It is so lovely arriving at the Milestone, not only is it homely and aesthetically welcoming it is also something the staff feel immensely proud of which is infectious.  Patrizio welcomed us at the door and Nick and Georgia greeted us on Reception.  Nick speaks the most beautiful English, you could listen to him all day!  Georgia gave a tour of the property, pointing out all the features, opening times etc.  This is such a great touch, I don't know why more hotels don't do it.  The team goes out of its way to make you feel attended to.    The hotel is also in a fantastic location.     My only criticisms are: * it was never explained whether breakfast was included or not, I felt awkward having to ask. * the rooms have way too much furniture in them for the size of the room,…"
May 2015,Superb!,"The Milestone Hotel in Kensington is absolutely top notch. From the moment of our arrival on May 28, 2015 and until our June 1, 2015 departure it was absolute bliss.  The staff, food, facilities and service made our initial family stay in London a memorable and fantastic visit. A special thanks to concierge Andrea.  His restaurant recommendations, Eurostar booking and activity planning is better than any travel agent. He does it all with a big smile and the happiest of disposition. Rest assured you will be so happy if you have the pleasure of staying at The Milestone. It deserves a rating higher than a five star. "
May 2015,We will definitely be returning to The Milestone,"We've just returned home from a 3 night stay at The Milestone, and can fully understand why it is No.1 on TripAdvisor. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special. In fact, even before we arrived,  the lovely concierge team, Jose, Andrea etc organised all of our tickets and dinner reservations for us. Making our stay completely stress free. They even arranged a very special treat for our car crazy son ( a tour around London in a chauffeur driven Bentley). All members of staff were an absolute delight, offering an exceptional service being both friendly and professional at all times. Steven the doorman, always had the biggest smile on his face and was so helpful, even on our last day when he was feeling under the whether. During our stay we had breakfast, dinner and…"
May 2015,"Great Location, Exceptional Service",I choose this hotel because of the reviews and I did not want to stay at the usual big chains.  The staff and our apt. was amazing.  An apt. is the way to go if you are bringing family.  There was ample room for my daughters and my husband.  We all had our separate rooms since I booked the roof top apt.   From the moment we came we were greeted by Fran and Teddy who helped us will our bags and gave us a tour of the hotel and apt.  Andre and Joshua helped us with our tours and tickets.  The bus stop is near the hotel along with High Kensington Underground.  With Kensington park across the street we were able to feel we were not in the concrete jungle.  With the bus lines there are several that stop at the nearby bus station.  We went with Evans Big Bus that along with the other…
June 2014,"Amazing staff, lovely hotel, great location.","We had the pleasure of staying at The Milestone Hotel in London in 2013.  The location is great - opposite beautiful Kensington Gardens and the Palace, near shops and a short walk to The Albert Hall and the Station.  The room was beautifully decorated and with a high degree of comfort.  The staff were amazing!  We felt genuine warmth and consideration. They were only too happy to help us in any way but at no time were intrusive.  A wonderful few days. (Had to put 2014 as no option for 2013)."
July 2015,Best time of our lives,"The hotel is the best we have been here 3 days and love it. I can't find anything wrong which for a hotel is a lot to brag on. Staff is friendly super helpful and just the greatest! Benjamin,Jose,John Andrea Jeffery,the room service staff,and housekeeping are the nicest friendliest people all you have to do is ask. Last Nite we went to a play and at intermission called hotel and asked if we could order a pizza John said no problem. When we got back our special luck we have had since here a staff member who happened to be Italian recommended a place John called and half hour later pizza so good never had any so good. Connie and I had TV on went to change channel got stuck on Milestone commercial. We couldn't shut it off. We love the Milestone but an hour and half of the…"
June 2015,The perfect London Hotel,"I had a wonderful stay at the Milestone. We booked through booking.com, several months before our visit in June. Booking early paid off, the hotel rate went up significantly as we got closer to our travel date.  I had the hotel schedule a car to pick me up at Heathrow; a very friendly driver, who got me to the hotel safe and sound, met me.  When entering the hotel I was greeted by several members of the staff, everyone was very accommodating. Check in was easy; I was made to feel very welcome. The hotel is very clean, with excellent services and amenities. Our room came with free breakfast, which was more than a small buffet of cold food. We were able to order off the breakfast menu at no additional cost. The breakfasts were wonderful, I think we had one of the best waffles we…"
June 2015,A True Five Star experience!,"If one is looking for a superb location, quiet elegance, historic building, unsurpassed service and attention to detail, this hotel ticks all those boxes.From the time you pull up in your taxi you are treated like royalty. The door is opened quickly, your luggage whisked away and deposited in your room magically within a few seconds and you are enveloped in a warm and cossetted atmosphere of sumptuous furnishings, and friendly relaxed service from all concerned. Everyone knows your name and any request is quickly attended to.   This is an expensive hotel but unlike many other hotels of this category you get what you pay for any more... My king bedded superior room had a view over Kensington Gardens and was beautifully appointed. Before your arrival you are sent a guest request…"
June 2015,Fantastic Hotel,"The Milestone is truly a place we will continue to return to. The hotel itself, the Staff, location, everything is perfect. No request is too small and everyone made us feel really special. From the greeting at the door to the last minute getting into the car, the staff is there to help and ensure every need is met. The breakfast was awesome, we still talk about the afternoon tea. I am not normally a person that takes pictures of food, but this one goes into my vacation album. We will be back this year if only there are rooms available!"
February 2015,Favourite London Hotel,"This is literally my favourite hotel in London and one of the best in Europe... Its literally sat opposite Kensington Palace which is a huge part of its charm. Its interior suits its location, very formally English however its flavour is a very cosy comfy English country sort of vibe.. The Hotel serves a traditional English afternoon tea, fabulous cocktails if desired.. Its location to all essential must see's in London and just on top of the West End. The Albert Hall is just around the corner.. I've stayed many times which is usually through the winter and its cosiness and charm makes for a definate return visit, time and time again .. Always a treat .."
June 2015,Great stay ....,"This beautiful, charming hotel is across the street from Hyde Park & Kensington Palace ---- a great location. The view of the Park from our room was very nice. Even being on a busy street there was very little noise. We had a peaceful, restful stay. This is a great location so walking was was a good option to several areas.  This staff really took pride in this hotel & their jobs --- this was obvious each minute of each day. We were always greeted with Smiling Faces & service was tops on their list.  As far as the bar & Restaurant, we found them to be good.  When back in London, we will stay here again ! "
June 2015,Such a lovely hotel,"My husband booked this hotel for our anniversary. From the moment we arrived we felt so welcome. The door man was such a lovely man who was so helpful with offering restaurant ideas and making sure we had a taxi etc. The reception desk staff were so polite, helpful and interested in where we were from and our reasons for the stay etc. Offering different services including help with restaurant choices, ideas of where we could visit in London and areas to avoid due to an event happening. We got shown around the hotel and shown to our room.  The room was lovely, over looking Hyde Park. The bathroom was a lovely size and very clean. Overall I love this hotel and definitely want to visit it again. Would love to bring the children so they can listen to the man playing the piano by the…"
May 2015,Truly a remarkable place.,"Across the busy street, we observe paparazzi stationed at entrance/exit points like bees surrounding a hive. Further up the lush green grounds, there is a long queue of global media personnel, electronic equipment, vans and transmission dishes, protected from the weather by a large, white tent-like tops. The media brandish microphones and cameras, and have already staked out Kensington Palace for a week, hoping to capture footage of visiting royals. Charlotte was born yesterday.   Staying in the Milestone Hotel, we are strategically located and in a far more lush boutique environment than that of the paparazzi. The Milestone was voted the ""Number One"" hotel in the UK and won the 2014 Trip Advisor Traveler's Choice award. it is a luxurious experience. And as you step inside you…"
June 2015,Very poor hotel,"A dreadful place, an old building, two in fact, conjoined and very claustropobhic. In the bar while another customer fell over on the marble floor with hidden steps, we paid £85 for a round of drinks for 7. The food was OK but a chicken pie for £27.00... I mean? It does not matter how rich you are, there are far better hotels and restaurants in London to take your money. Avoid this place as it is expensive and very poor. It is designed to extract the maximum from its customers. Please AVOID."
June 2015,"Fab hotel, fab location, excellent professional but friendly staff","I've travelled to every corner of the world and was surprised to visit my old home town and stay in probably the best hotel ever....breakfast chef definitely the best.  A great welcome from steven in his top hat (who came to my rescue as my handbag broke on the way out!)...4-5 staff immediately on hand when you enter, and its a small hotel.  Elsa went beyond the call of duty and had balloons and a yummy cake waiting for my birthday boyfriend.  I couldn't fault anything! They even light a candle in your bathroom at night....true class."
May 2015,We will always stay here when in London!,"We can not say enough wonderful things about The Milestone Hotel in London.  From the minute we stepped out of our transportation from the airport to even after we had left, the entire staff at the Milestone treated our family like kings and queens!  Our room was ready and amazing!  The room service was fabulous and served so quickly each night and morning!  Each staff member was helpful to a point of going out of their way to assist us!  The Concierge- Andrea and his staff were amazing!  Manny took his time to actually retrieve a package for my son.  If there was a point greater than five stars - the Concierge desk would receive from us! They even assisted us with transportation after we had checked out because of an issue in Paris .  My husband and son enjoyed the  service in…"
May 2015,"The entire staff was truly first rate, especially the concierge and front desk.","This is only my first or second ever review of a hotel on Trip Advisor, but I just have to brag about this hotel. The concierge has an assistant, and they are both almost always on standby, available immediately. The hotel's overall level of service is the best I have ever seen. We used the concierge at all hours throughout our stay, and they exceeded our hopes on every occasion."
May 2015,Happy and friendly staff beyond compare!,"We would gladly have stay longer than our 3 nights! We were upgraded (due to our use of Am Ex Platinum reservation) to a charming room with amenities the best we've experienced in UK: both US AND international power outlets in several places - several with additional power switches to control hotel usage!; bathroom LED ceiling nightlight, 2 comfortable chairs with  ottomans for relaxing and tv viewing; a variety of clothes rods in the auto-lighted closet. The Concierges( Jose, Andreas and Josh) were all exceptional - getting us even the ""impossible"" tickets! Several venues  - all charming - for tea or snacks. Any question or request was handled with enthusiasm. Each mealtime we eagerly anticipated. The conservatory for tea with rains overhead was charming! We felt as tho we were…"
June 2014,Amazing place to stay,"I haven't stayed at the Milestone Hotel for the last couple of years (had to use June 2014) as a date because I wasn't given an option to choose an earlier date.   The Milestone is the best hotel I've stayed in London and I've stayed in a lot of them. The staff are a credit to the hotel & the concierge is the best I've encountered, table reservations for full up restaurants, theatre tickets for sold out shows - nothing is impossible for them.   The rooms have a lovely old world charm but lose none of the creature comforts that one looks for in a hotel. The gym is small but well equipped and with Kensington Palace grounds just opposite the hotel you will be spoiled for choice in case you fancy a jog or a walk outdoors.   Longer stay guests can't go wrong with the apartments…"
August 2014,WOW,we stopped here for a spot of lunch and oh boy was it good! The food was fantastic and the staff were delightful. We will definitely be staying here in the future. The place was spotless and the people were delightful. Recommended
December 2014,Has been a pleasurr,"Me and my wife in this hotel,kind staff large and clean room gave has a nice Experience. Precious help for the early chek in and store bugages on the departure day. Very good advices about restaurants and how to get to city center. We Will come back soon."
May 2015,"Lovely hotel, caring staff, delicious food, ideal location","My sister and I recently stayed at this hotel (13-15 May) to see Eric Clapton at the Royal Albert Hall (10 minute walk). Opposite Kensington Gardens, the location is ideal. The hotel is lovely - our room overlooked K. Gardens, had a blue theme (my sister was asked what colour she liked when booking), the lounge was lush, comfortable and beautifully furnished. Breakfast was delicious - we had it in the hotel every day - it was too good to miss.The thing I would highlight most are the staff, who were all fantastic. My sister is recovering from treatment and currently uses crutches and a wheel chair. The doormen were so attentive - and could not do enough to help - as were all the other staff."
March 2015,Special Treat,"Booked this hotel for a birthday treat for my wife and I from an offer web site. Wanted somewhere quiet, comfortable, good location and with good restaurant.  Well this hotel ticks all the boxes and more. We loved the room, everything you could need was there, all worked and first class quality. Diner was a wonderful experience, perfect lighting, service, food and wine with soft tones of a piano wafting in. Nothing was to much trouble for the staff, very happy team! Worth every penny, will return one day. Oyster Box in Durban also very memorable."
May 2015,Luxurious London Hotel,"We had a one night stay in this hotel - luxurious without being ostentatious.  Wonderful service, excellent location and a very wide range of food offered at breakfast.  The Eggs Benedict were superb!  The location is ideal for Kensington Palace and the Albert Hall.  We incorporated this stay with a visit to Babylon and the Roof Top Gardens in Kensington, which are a five minute walk from the hotel."
May 2015,The quality of quaint,"This hotel is a real gem, from the location, the quality through to the warm welcome from Fran the butler. We couldn't fault anything. Everything was done to perfection, cleaning and turndown service, breakfast (eggs benedict is to die for!), bar (friendly staff), doorman and concierge. An all round wonderful experience."
April 2015,My Dream Hotel,"From the moment we walked in the door, we knew we were someplace special. We were warmly greeted at the Reception Desk, taken on a brief tour of the main floor, and then escorted to our room, where freshly-baked cookies, a glass of champagne and bottled water awaited us. We enjoyed a delicious dinner one evening and a ""proper"" English breakfast each day. Every aspect of our stay at The Milestone exemplified first-class customer service and amenities. I especially loved the lighted magnifying mirror in the bathroom. The concierge, Joshua, was especially helpful in finding dinner reservations and providing directions to various locations, while the doorman greeted us warmly each time we returned. We had the added ""adventure"" of misplacing some jewelry during our stay. I contacted…"
March 2015,Great location for the Albert Hall,"We have stayed in quite a few hotels in this area, when going to The Albert Hall. This is by far the best. Good location, nice rooms, very nice staff, good service, and (very importantly!!) a good cooked breakfast."
July 2014,Extraordinary Find,"This hotel was amazing. When I arrived with my parents, husband and daughter, they told me that they didn't have a room that could accommodate the 3 of us - my parents had their own room. They didn't have my daughter down on the reservation, although I had a copy that clearly showed 2 adults, 1 child. I was a little angry and asked that they figure it out while we walked the palace gardens across the street...boy, did they. They set us up in a beautiful suite for 11 days with no additional up charge. Great room! Great location across from Kensington Palace. Super friendly doormen. We enjoyed our stay and would go back. "
February 2015,Perfect stay,"I surprised my wife with a two night stay at this hotel to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary. We both enjoyed it. From the moment we stepped at the doorways, the staff are all welcoming and very polite. View from our room was fantastic. Room service was fast.  We enjoyed every bit of service the hotel offered. It really lives to its name.  Now, my wife has a new favorite hotel in UK."
April 2015,Unique and lovely room.,"We asked for a room facing Hyde Park/Kensington Palace and gardens and were not disappointed. Although the room was small, the circular window facing the gardens in the step-up area was special and unique and we loved it. The room also had the largest bathroom I've ever had in London. Service was perfect and the hotel Concierge was personable and very helpful at suggestions, arranging side trips and making dinner reservations. If we ever get to go to London again, we will definitely stay here."
May 2015,Perfection on the park,"The Milestone Hotel is a dream worth remembering.  Located in Kensington, the Milestone delivers an amazing London experience. Exquisitely crafted out of three private homes, the hotel's rooms and suites are charming, well appointed and highly functional.  Each of the suites is unique, and it might be worth it to go back and experience each one.  The staff is uniformly excellent from the smiling doormen to the efficient concierge and management. The Milestone packs a lot into a small space - excellent food service, charming bar, good gym and famous afternoon tea. A highlight of the experience is sitting in the conservatory room either under the stars with a glass of wine or with a book and a cup of tea.  We stayed in the Regency Suite, and its amazing copper soaking tub brought…"
December 2014,A brilliant stay,"Stayed 2 nights. We had a lovely room with a 4 poster bed, copper bath, and sitting area in the bedroom. One night we had rose petals on turn down. Service was very good. The hotel is bang opposite Kensington Gardens so very handy for walking in the park or visiting Kensington Palace. Also handy for the shops and restaurants in High St Ken. We ate at the restaurant both evenings and the food was so good I had the same thing both times. Both times it was Superb. Breakfast was also very good. The building is full of period features and atmosphere."
April 2015,"Like home, only better","When you arrive at The Milestone, you are greeted with a warm smile by the doorman, Steven. From the second you lay eyes on him he is your loyal companion that will make the most out of every moment of your stay. Once inside, you are in competent hands that will ensure that you are well catered for. Everything is easy at The Milestone. The check in process, how your bags are handled, and the complementary welcome drink are just examples of services that - at a regular hotel - would feel a little awkward and tiresome but at The Milestone you feel as if you've been let into the home of a  good friends. You are taken on a tour of the facilities and of your room and once the door is shut behind you you feel utterly transported to another time and space. Small things, like the lovely…"
May 2015,"Luxury personified, look no further for the best!","My wife and I stayed at The Milestone for 1 night on Saturday 2nd May to celebrate my wifes birthday which is also our wedding anniversary, quite simply this hotel is luxury personified. On arrival we were immediately welcomed by the front desk team and greeted by our name, we were introduced to the hotel Butler Fran, he gave us a full tour of the hotel and then showed us to our room and explained all the amenities of it, we were pleased to hear we had been upgraded to Junior Suite room 402, the room was luxuriously appointed and had a large bathroom with the highest quality bathroom linen. We were offered a complimentary drink on arrival which we took in the elegant Stables Bar. We had dinner in Chenistons Restaurant, the cuisine was quite simply devine which was served with…"
March 2015,Ask .... and it shall be yours ....,"I cannot imagine a more accommodating place to stay .... anywhere.  Whether we were looking for a quick family dinner within walking distance, the best value in purchasing tickets or passes for London's subway/bus system, information on various museums, more of my son's favorite breakfast items (fresh yogurt and milk in the glass bottles and jars, and the French toast), nearby grocery stores or just a route for a neighborhood walk, the Milestone staff had it covered.  Without question, they were pleasant, funny, knowledgeable and efficient.  They even helped my daughter and her London friends figure out where to get the best deals on a particular clothing line.  The location can't be beat with Kensington Gardens across the street and a ""tube"" stop a block and a half away.  We…"
April 2015,Very comfortable and excellent restaurant,We stayed only the one night but would have loved to stay longer.  They ensured our stay was memorable.  We were celebrating our 20th Wedding Anniversary (China) and the relationship manager gave us champagne on the house and also sourced a lovely china cup and saucer crammed with chocolates as a lovely surprise.  The restaurant was superb.  From start to finish each course was a culinary masterpiece of taste.  I would certainly love to eat there again.  The lounge bar (Stables) was quaint and we had excellent service.  All the staff were attentive and couldn't do enough for us.  It is right opposite Kensington Gardens so lovely for a stroll.  The High Street Kensington is within walking distance.
February 2015,Wonderful Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at The MIlestone for a romantic night away and it was absolutely wonderful. We had a plan to just enjoy the hotel and relax and that's exactly what we did. We had our welcome drink in the bar, our dinner in Cheneston's (which was absolutely lovely), after dinner drinks in the bar and then retired to our room. Our room was a beautiful corner room with amazing views of Kensington Palace and park, it was well appointed with everything we needed including little treats that we were greeted with upon arrival. We had breakfast in our room instead of downstairs and I have to be honest, it was one of the best parts of our stay! I don't know why I don't do it more often when travelling.The selection of food was gorgeous and plentiful and it was so nice to just sit…"
April 2015,25th Anniversary Trip,"The attention to detail that the staff provides was above and beyond. At check in we were treated to champagne and delicious pastries. On our first night we returned to our room to find chocolate covered strawberries and rose petals strewn throughout.  English breakfast was included and was delicious (Eggs Benedict, omelets, soufflé pancakes and pastries and more). The hotel is conveniently located by the Tube, Kensington Palace, shopping and great restaurants.  The concierge emailed us prior to the trip recommending sight seeing locations including an exclusive tour of Buckingham Palace (our trip highlight)which we would have missed had it not been for him (we didn't know this tour was available, thinking the palace was only open in the summer). The staff was friendly and…"
April 2015,"Five Great days at the Milestone, London","Through my travel agent in Ft. Worth, my wife and i enjoyed the benefits of the Virtuoso connection to the Milestone. We are not strangers to London. This hotel left us both very happy and relaxed and thrilled about coming back soon. The hotel is spotless and extremely clean. We cannot think of a single negative element of the facility or the wonderful staff.  Again, the staff made the difference, as all were refreshingly happy and friendly--   The very best i have ever experienced."
April 2015,Most amazing hotel,"We recently spent 2 nights at this wonderful hotel and felt like treasured guests.From the moment we were greeted on the front steps, we knew we would have a wonderful stay.Our room was beautiful with every small detail you could wish for including a view of Kensington Gardens and thoughtful gifts -  a  Birthday cake for my partner and candles in the bathroom.Nothing was too much trouble for the staff.Breakfast choices were supurb especially the Eggs Benedict.The restaurant serves wonderful dishes to tempt and delight you.We would highly recommend this small and unique hotel and would award it with more than 5 stars.Thank you."
April 2015,Across from entry to Kensington Palace/Quiet Neighborhood,"This trip we rented a two bedroom flat, since we had our two grandsons with us for a grand tour of London. The bedrooms were quite small. One bathroom was very adequate, the second one was very narrow. The staff & ambiance are, however, over top. Their high tea is also A+.  Yes, we will stay here again. If you have children with you & are tired at the end of the day, there is a huge Whole Foods one block away with a full food court as well as a M&S."
April 2015,Comfortable stay,"Really nice hotel, rooms were clean and really specious, staff friendly and accomodating, had breakfast one morning and it was also great. Fully recommned this hotel to anyone and hopefully will be back myslef"
April 2015,#1 for a reason,"I can't say enough good things about this hotel. From the moment you walk in you a welcomed by everyone. The rooms are wonderful--all unique, and the beds are so comfortable. The concierge team is the best I have experienced. They were helpful prior to arrival and even more so while we were there. From dinners to theater to a fresh cup of coffee in the morning--simply the best!  If I could give new stars I would."
March 2015,The Very Best!,"I recently stayed several days at the Milestone Hotel.  I wish I could give them more than five stars!  I cannot say enough positive things about the hotel AND the staff.  The hotel was very nice but the staff really made our visit incredible. You can tell from the moment you arrive that the staff take pride in doing their jobs well and make their guests feel very special.   An hour after check-in, they remembered our name and made us feel like old friends!  Each of them went out of their way to help us in any way they could with directions, restaurants, transportation, and I could go on and on.  They always wanted to know if we needed anything or if they could help us with anything.   And they were sincere!  The hotel was very clean, comfortable, and charming and some of the…"
April 2015,Wonderful stay,"We spent Easter at the Milestone (Family with 3 Kids aged 18, 16 and 9) and want to share our incredible experience. From the first hello to the last goodbye you feel welcome here. The staff is so friendly and genuinely concerned with the wellbeing of the Hotel guests. When our son ordered lactose free scrambled eggs on the first day, and we forgot to mention it on the second, the breakfast staff had remembered and placed the order on their own volition. I could not believe it. Nothing is too much and service is always with a smile. The Concierge helped us with a conundrum concerning theatre tickets at a level of kindness which brought tears to my eyes. Thanks again, we will truly never forget. The rooms are charming, the beds dreamy and there is always a little edible surprise…"
April 2015,Outstanding ,"This hotel is an example of hotel theatre at its best. From The moment that you step out of the car you are made to feel like very important guest. The tour of the hotel, the offers to help, the recommendations, the bookings in fact everything was perfect. The team who took care of our every need deserve all the praise they get. I am very happy to give this the strongest of recommendations on every level. Congratulations on your attention to detail folks, it shows. "
March 2015,Fantastic 2 night city break,"A lovely hotel with views over Kensington Palace. Easy access to Albert hall and city by bus or Taxi. The hotel was very clean the beds comfortable, the staff were lovely and friendly made you welcome and at ease and couldn't do too much for you.Plenty of choice for breakfast, buffet and freshly cooked food if required. The room was quiet with a lovely view over to Kensington Palace. We will certainly return next time we come to London"
March 2015,Very welcoming staff,"I recently returned for another stay at the Milestone, it's always a pleasure, the staff are extremely attentive and helpful.  Breakfast is the highlight of the day, concierge and reception staff pay attention to the smallest detail. Another enjoyable stay."
February 2015,The icing on the cake!,"Staying at the Milestone truly made our visit to London just perfect.  Located a bit off the busy touristy areas of London, this boutique hotel will cater to your every whim.  As a family of five, we needed at least two rooms.  We were offered the option of staying in one of the five apartments that are part of the hotel. This option was perfect for us. Attached to the hotel - separated by just a hallway door - we received every service that your typical rooms receive and more.  Gifts for us upon arrival, personalized note included.  This hotel is owned by the Red Carnation Hotels and they take pride in making your experience at their establishment's one of the best hotel experiences you've had. Their managers go out of their way to find out what you like and how they can enrich…"
March 2015,Fantastic Hotel - Wonderful Stay,"We were booked for a one night stay as we were going to see The Who playing for Teenage Cancer Trust at Royal Albert Hall, from the moment we walked through the front door until the moment we left, the staff were fantastic, helping in whichever way they could.  Our room was on the 4th floor, The Jungle Room, so quite, you would not believe you were on a busy street in Kensington.  Breakfast was delicious, as were the complimentary Biscuits delivered to our room.  Thank you for a great stay, we will certainly be returning."
March 2015,birthday treat,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Milestone on a  birthday trip to The Albert Hall and I cannot praise this hotel enough. The premises are quirky and full of character and history and the staff full of knowledge of the past of the premises. On arrival we were given a tour of the premises which is something new to me and helped us to find our way around. All of the staff were excellent, friendly, cheerful, proficient and only too willing to help. Altogether a great visit which made a special occasion even more special. I would rate this hotel as one of the best London hotels I have ever stayed in and can't wait for my next visit,"
March 2015,Wonderful hotel,"Took a short weekend in London, including a night at the Milestone. A beautiful hotel with wonderful and helpful staff, who know the difference been good service and being intrusive. Room was everything it should be, food was as good as expected and nothing was too much trouble  A wonderful hotel"
March 2015,So Relaxing,"This was the first time I'd stayed at the Hotel and it will now be my first choice when travelling to London. I stayed here a week ago in a Deluxe Room. The room was high up on the 5th floor. Even though the room was next to a lift I heard nothing in all the time I was there, inside the Hotel or noise from outside. I enjoyed drinks in the bar on 2 occasions and the friendliness of all the staff was what stood out to other Hotels in London. The hotel is right across the road to Hyde Park, which is great for a walk at any time. If you want a big brash busy hotel don't come here but if you want a quiet hotel that has that extra personal touch, it's the place to come."
March 2015,Birthday treat. ,"I stayed at The Milestone Hotel with my Mother, as a belated birthday treat.  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left nothing was too much trouble. The small gifts and welcome card made us feel special. I was even surprised by  delicious birthday cake. 🎂 We are planning on returning later in the year along with my brother and his wife for a weekend.  The service was excellent but more importantly everyone seemed to be happy in their job.  The breakfast was amazing, a wide choice made deciding what to eat different. I finally chose the vegetarian breakfast..yummy !  Lovely hotel with lovely people. "
March 2015,Our Home in London,"My husband and I travel to London often and we've stayed at a number of London hotels. When we discovered the Milestone, we've decided it's our home away from home when we're in London. We love their breakfast and tea rooms, the staff is genuinely cheerful and friendly, the location is impeccable and we are treated like honoured guests in a very fine home. We are often tempted to go to London just to stay a few nights at the Milestone."
March 2015,Outstanding.,"Simply one of the best hotels I've stayed in. Went to London to watch a show so booked in for two nights. From the moment we arrived,the staff were so helpful,corteous and polite. The room was lovely as was the rest of the hotel. Afternoon tea is not to be missed,but make sure you're not on a diet as there was no frugal offering,we couldn't finish it!!!!  The standards are set high and they achieve them. Would definitely recommend anyone to stay here,we are going back again in May and taking are daughters with us. 10/10 easily. Thank you.  Mr Knowles"
March 2015,45th wedding anniversary,"We had a wonderful stay in the milestone. We could not fault it and we have stayed in many hotels and there would always be something that was not up to scratch. They deserve to have five stars. Thank you to all the staff , for the champagne petals and candles in our room.  Magic.  I recommend  This hotel 100 percent. Kind regards  Florence Fitzmaurice"
March 2015,It doesn't get better than this!,"My wife and son and I were lucky to have spent 9 days in one of the Milestone's apartments, which feature complimentary access to all hotel facilities.  This place is the top of the top.  The staff are generous, delightful, attentive and would do anything make your stay the best it can be.  All the small touches and amenities around the room were the best.  They have thought of everything!  I've stayed at a number of 5-star properties but Milestone was completely in a class by itself.  I can imagine anyone would be quickly warmed to the old-world charm and comforts embraced by their staff and residences."
March 2015,Absolutely stunning hotel and wonderful staff,"Our first experience at this hotel and we will definitely be back.  We came to London to pick up a puppy we had acquired and the hotel was not only accommodating, we a dog bed, water bowl, food bowl, towels for puppy, gift for puppy, name tag for puppy !  The hotel reminds one of the glorious English elegance; lovely wood panelling, gorgeous perfume of cleanness all through the hotel and the restaurant is superb!  Thank you especial to Benjamin and front desk staff and manager for your kindness and hospitality."
March 2015,First class,"We stayed as we were seeing Madame Butterfly at the Albert Hall. The hotel is a short walk from the hall, opposite Hyde Park and near Kensington High St. The building and rooms are lovely and of the Regency period. The staff are excellent. The hotel was featured in the Sunday Times as being one of the best companies to work for and it shows in the care and attention you receive. Genuinely helpful and couldn't be better - well done to the Milestone Team. "
March 2015,Everyone is right.  It's that simple.,"Just spent a week at the Milestone with my son.  Got back last night and I'm already writing this review.  OUTSTANDING HOTEL.  From the minute we arrived to the moment we left, this hotel experience was top notch in every way.    Now for the irony:  Our room was not ready when we arrived and the room we checked into was too small for me and my teenage boy.  The way the staff (Beth you are a consummate pro) handled this situation from beginning to end was flawless.  Let's face it:  Things will go wrong at even at the finest hotels.  The experience you have when things go wrong is far more telling than the experience you have when all goes as planned.  When our room was not ready, we were kindly guided to the gorgeous conservatory and fed a delightful lunch on the house.  When I…"
March 2015,"We felt more like ""old friends"" than like guests!","As a family with two children we had the opportunity to stay for a week in the Victoria&Albert apartment of The Milestone Hotel located directly at Kensington Gardens, London. The apartment was spacious (two bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms, a large living room and a very well equipped kitchen) and we felt that the interior design was typical for Great Britain. The whole staff was incredibly helpful, and we felt well very well accommodated, e.g. my wife and me had some problems with the pillows provided, but when we mentioned this to the concierge, he showed us the hotel´s ""pillow menu"" and we were provided with most comfortable memory foam pillows, thus, in the remaining nights we slept perfectly well! Even short-timed questions as ""Could you get us 4 cards for the musical…"
March 2015,Thank you all so much.,"Dear Andrew and staff.  This hotel is the best of the best.  My wife and I stayed 4 nights at The Milestone, and I do not know how it possibly could have better.  All of the staff(too many to name) were very helpful and accommodating.  Superior service, coupled with a genuine friendly attitude made our stay very memorable. Thank you all so much for your warmth and hospitality. D.Wagner, MD"
February 2015,First class service !! Lovely hotel all around.,We just returned from spending two nights at the Milestone.  The staff was wonderful and they make you feel so welcome.  We had the Matisse room --- ceilings are a bit low and there area few steps down.  It was beautifully furnished. It has small windows and is rather dark.  The welcome note and basket was much appreciated.  We also enjoyed a proper cream tea -- and a trip to the bar was met by a wonderful bartender who clearly takes pride in his job and the hotel  Breakfast a delicious experience.  We would happily stay here again.
January 2015,magic moments,have a goodnight sleep here Plenty to do   You can do all most anything here Night life is amazing local bars Maybe an adventure for you And very disability friendly lifts Ramps   You try it you will have a good time
February 2015,Amazing Hotel,"I arranged this hotel as was recommended by the Royal Albert Hall.  I knew from arranging our accomodation on the phone which was very professional  I would not be disappointed.  We had the 'african' room which was delightful and cosy and the hotel made a princess bed for our 7 year old daughter who accompanied us. As I had notified the hotel of my partners birthday we were greeted with a delicious choc cake and a complimentary glass of champagne along with hand signed cards which was extremely thoughtful and much appreciated.   We were welcomed with warm smiles, and very friendly staff, instantly feeling at home, we had a guided tour by the lovely Georgia Woods, who could not have been any more helpful and at hand to our needs.  She was very professional and friendly and whilst…"
February 2015,Always a delight,"Andrew, Fran, Shane, Manny and all the Milestone team live their pillars of a home away from home. It is always a delight for my husband and I to stay here, they are beyond fabulous and I always feel so welcome. Nothing is too much and given at times I arrive here stressed, it's like a haven where I can recharge. Thanks guys!"
November 2014,Excellent,"Best hotel ever , real treat, staff very very friendly and helpful, i wasn t bothered sightseeing London too much, because i didn t want to leave the comfort and cosy ness of the Hotel. Will go back again,if possible!Highly recommendable, even for the most demanding amongst us..."
February 2015,Characterful Country House hotel in Kensington,"The Milestone is a stunning, comfortable hotel with a lot of history and all the staff are very friendly and welcoming. I like that there are different areas to sit and eat/ drink, ranging from the Stables bar to the cosy tearoom and the retro black and white conservatory. The artwork is amazing and gives the hotel a very personal touch. Everything is very well thought out, with great attention to detail. Finger sandwiches for lunch were light and delicious and my boyfriend loved the cheeseboard- no bland cheeses there! In the evening we had a wonderful dinner, guinea fowl for my boyfriend and gnocchi for me- vegetarians are very well catered for on all the menus here and are not treated as an inconvenience. The breakfast is superb with eggs Benedict and Florentine being a…"
January 2015,Nice location and quiet spot for a stay in Kensington,"I chose The Milestone Hotel because of its reputation and ratings among hotels located in Kensington convenient to where my friends live. Now, of course, I realize that The Milestone is one of the most highly rated hotels in all of London (and Europe), certainly among the boutique set, but the main driver for me was location. The building it occupies has had many lives (the bar was created out of the area that previously housed the stables, for example).  This is a lovely boutique hotel, no question. The rooms are decorated in a traditional English style rather than a modern one, and my deluxe room was very comfortable and reasonably sized. They have satellite TV service, 24 hour room service, and the room layout worked quite well for me. The gym is very small but functional and…"
November 2014,Wonderful break at The Milestone,"I have just returned from a two night break with my Mum at The Milestone Hotel. If you are looking for a hotel with impeccable service, delicious food and a relaxing, comfortable atmosphere, then look no further. When I arrived we were due to have Afternoon Tea, unfortunately my train was delayed, which meant we were late for our our time slot. When I did arrive I was welcomed by Frank and my bags and coat were taken for me, we were shown into the lounge for Afternoon Tea and received a complimentary glass of champagne. What can I say about the Afternoon Tea, it looked amazing and tasted delicious. We couldn't manage it all, and we're given boxes to take away the remaining pastries. Our bedroom was a deluxe twin room situated at the back of the hotel, so therefore was very quiet…"
November 2014,Lovely stay here,"Very Comfortable stay with marvelous breakfast. Lovely Bontique hotel with happy friendly staff, Great location. Would recommend and definitely stay here again. Comfortable bed, great facilities within the hotel and local area. I like the hotel very, very much!"
November 2014,"Totally faultless, best 40th present I could of given myself!","Stayed here for two nights for my 40th, the best service I have ever experienced and I run my own hotel! Regardless of the excellent location you already find yourself you could stay in your room the whole time and be perfectly content. We had already made food reservations in the city so didn't eat there but going off the breakfast I will certainly eat there on my return. A perfect luxurious two night stay, totally faultless."
November 2014,Very impressive problem management,"Having enjoyed afternoon tea on several occasions we decided to finish off a weekend of engagement celebrations by having Sunday afternoon tea at The Milestone for 14 of us. Given the numbers, The Milestone offered us the use of Windsor Suite to make it a private party. Through my focusing on the detail and failing to look at the bigger picture, there was a misunderstanding over the chosen date, which meant our party arrived a day earlier than expected! Fortunately, as hosts, we had arrived half an hour early, and the Windsor Suite was free. Suffice to say the problem was handled in an exemplary manner, and when the remainder of the party arrived 30 minutes later everything was ready, such that I am sure none of the group realised what had happened.  Tea was to the usual high…"
November 2014,Tradition and Quality at its best,"I don't write reviews but I read many. It's time to break that tradition to applaud all those at the Milestone who clearly believe quality, tradition and customer care should not be compromised. It's true, from the moment you arrive to the last farewell nothing is too much trouble. I have been fortunate and been to many ""5 star hotels"" but this is something else, a cross between Cunards ""white service"" quality and being with a warm-hearted grand country family. The attention to detail, gifts in the rooms for my daughters, my mother and my husband ( although WiFi and a good TV was enough for my girls!) and the beautiful dining room and fitness suite allowed us all to be more than content. If you believe in quality, the personal touch and elegance don't go anywhere else."
November 2014,Great place,"Having never stayed at the Milestone we really didn't know what to expect but we certainly could not have wanted a better location nor more attentive staff. This small hotel really made us feel welcome and the afternoon tea was the best we have ever had and yes we have had a few!  The staff were friendly but professional and the attention to detail was second to none, without picking out staff for a special mention, Ben the bar man went that extra mile to make the final celebration of our Ruby wedding that much more special. Would we stay again of course we would, it's not the cheapest hotel but it really does offer something special."
November 2014,A stunning weekend,"I stayed here in March 2014 with my partner as a special treat to both of us (my partner thought I would propose but I did not sadly, did later in year though!)  The welcome Joanne and I received was truly lovely and a special mention must go to our genial and well informed host who showed us round the hotel. Our room was located on the second floor and was furnished to the highest standards with not a thing I noticed wrong or out of place. This was our second visit to a Red Carnation Hotels Group property and the constant standards continued throughout.   We enjoyed a champagne lunch in the Horse Racing themed bar, the champagne, food and wine all of a high standard - we recommend the house white made by the owners!   The Welsh doorman provided expert advice on travel and…"
March 2014,"Service, style and staff","Wonderful location for my visit and though I was an early international arrival, I was quickly made to feel at home and escorted to their library for afternoon tea and within 30 minutes arriving at my room.  That was the beginning of the service I would receive over the next three days.  Attentive, accommodating staff providing the friendliest and most efficient service and always made certain that I had everything I needed.  I enjoyed the traditional decor and the cleanliness of my room and the hotel as well."
November 2014,Excellent Place,"Excellent place to stay and have functions.It can be fantastic facility and building is at excellent form which is actually impressive. Food is good, service is nice, Atmosphere is clean and so is the location.Full suggested by any means!"
November 2014,Excellent in everyway,"We go to London two or three times a year - only place we will be going is the Milestone Hotel - they asked how much we will give them out of 10 - we wish that we could give them more than 10 - fab place you can go over and over again - food, friendliness, rooms, locations, staff - you cannot ask for more - infect you do not need to ask its there for you to enjoy - if you are in London its a ""must"""
November 2014,Wonderful,"My partner took me here for a night on my birthday in November.  All I can say is it is a very special place. The room we had was the ballet room  (I think) blue but beautiful with windows overlooking the park. The staff, room, service and breakfast were all wonderful and I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone. The bathroom was wonderful and the toiletries fantastic. The acknowledgement of my birthday in our room was very special. The owner should be very pleased to know I appreciated what she was aiming at when she showed her personality into the hotel world. More hotels should be like this!"
January 2015,Birthday weekend.,"As a family we spent a wonderfull weekend at the hotel.Every thing about our stay was first class.The rooms were delightful,Staff first class in all areas, we were made to feel very special.We will certainly be returning.Thank all of you."
January 2015,Afternoon Tea at the Milestone,"we didn't stay at this hotel but I booked afternoon tea here after finding out they had a tea specially made for toddlers and I have a 3 year old. The staff were fantastic, helpful, friendly and professional. The tea is the best I have had in London, having previously tried Lanesborough and Harrods. Can't speak highly enough of this experience and will definitely go back!"
January 2015,Princess Afternoon Tea,Very impressed with afternoon tea at The Milestone Hotel. We took our 8 year old daughter and some friends for her birthday. They provided us with very high quality food and service. Will definitely be returning
January 2015,Staff make a stay special....and room surprise too!,"As a special treat for our wedding anniversary we stayed at the Milestone and from the time we arrived to the time we left the staff could not have been more attentive and thoughtful. From dropping the car off for valet parking, a welcome drink, luggage taken care of and to arriving back in our room to find the staff had 'dressed' the room while we were out with some lovely personal touches all made our stay special...we will be back. Great hotel with all the usual refinements you would expect but it's the staff that made it feel personal...."
January 2014,Very nice stay, Well if a little on the rough side I need is serviced at the front desk in the lobby they were a little rude and I didn't care like what they were doing a room and everything was better the room was beautiful had a good time at the pool was amazing and yeah there was so much more to do a lot of people and said this hotel is okay it's really picky for me
December 2014,Rude room service,Poor and rood room services staff not much to chose  Noisy  Expensive not match what you get Stay away from service elevator you won't be able to sleep it is like adril in the bed I prefer Bagilioni hotel
December 2014,Best service ever! Simply outstanding!,"You Know that this is not your ordinary chain hotel when you get a letter before your arrival asking for anything from pillow preferences to yoga mats. As it happened it was our anniversary and the attention from the staff was outstanding and made our stay most enjoyable.  Gifts and personal notes, chocolate-dipped strawberries in the evening. They even made us some hot chocolate to enjoy by the fireplace after a cold evening out. The room was large (by London standards) and had plenty of character and all the comforts you'd expect at a 5-star hotel. Breakfast was also excellent, so we'll forgive them for having a rather small pool. All in all a very enjoyable and memorable stay. Highly recommended!"
December 2014,A fabulous hotel which surpassed expectation,"I booked the romance package deal for my husband's 40th birthday, which included one night's stay, breakfast, pink champagne on arrival etc. I had read the trip advisor reviews beforehand and expected superb service and staff and was not disappointed. Upon arrival, I learnt that we had been upgraded to a junior suite, which was absolutely amazing. The staff were warm, friendly and as my husband commented, always knew what you wanted - taxi; luggage storing; bag for a selection of Christmas themed Chocs from the help yourself bowl on reception - before you even did! Everything about this hotel was 5* quality and we couldn't fault a thing. The decor is beautiful and in keeping with the age of the building. The general atmosphere is one of exclusivity coupled with a unique charm.…"
December 2014,"Splash out, it's well worth it!","Fabulous hotel from the moment you leave the taxi to be greeted by the doorman with a light up smile. All staff were friendly & helpful. The personal touches make this hotel outstanding. Stunning room & huge bed. The gifts in the room, the hand written welcome letter, the huge fluffy towels & soft thick robes. Beautiful breakfast & attentive but not intrusive staff. Thank you!  I could get very used to this standard!"
December 2014,England done well!,"If you are looking for a classic hotel that is not on Park Lane or within the midst of tourist this is your place!  Charming lobby, awesome lounge and classic bar in the back of the hotel.  This hotel has a very homey feel because the staff is truly amazing.  They are there when you need them, but not in your face every time you turn around.  An example of how good the staff is, was one morning at breakfast I overheard a couple trying to order porridge with some items on the side.  After a few moments of the customer trying to organize their thoughts regarding honey, raisins brown sugar and other goodies, the waiter said, ""How about you tell me exactly what you wish and I will do my best to make it come true"".  A few minutes later there were two bowls of porridge and a whole…"
October 2014,Spectacular,"It was absolutely a dream, from the professional but warm welcoming, to the room very tidy and clean, nothing to complaint about it. Great location, a wonderful and unforgettable experience, I even recommended my parents."
June 2014,London's Finest!,"I had recently graduated and was traveled to London and Paris with my mom and aunt. My aunt chose this hotel and I was speechless when we walked into the lobby. This place is impeccable. It started with the a friendly staff welcoming us to town and giving us advice on places to go and eat. The place itself was beautiful from the inside to the outside. There were many little rooms to relax and lounge. The room was the ""African"" room with the decor being just that (cheetah, leopard, zebra, etc.) It was odd and unexpected but it was cozy. I was stuck with the roll away bed, which was surprisingly comfortable. The linens were so soft and warm that it was a great night sleep every night. We dined a few times in the dining room which was just as great as we could have imagined. This…"
November 2014,Everything it promised it would be.,A wonderful birthday trip for my husband. And his first trip to London. Our room was darling. You will sleep like an angel. Great breakfast. Fantastic concierge service. London was shining brightly. This is the place. Book it.
November 2014,Simply The Best,"I've stayed at many London hotels over the years, but since I discovered The Milestone I never stay anywhere else. I stayed there for almost 3 weeks this year whilst having day patient hospital treatment nearby and the friendliness of everyone was amazing - i never felt that I was alone. I was there 3 weeks ago with my wife - the concierge remembered that it was around the time of my birthday from previous visits. In fact it was the very day of my birthday and in no time at all a very choclatie birthday cake was delivered to our room. All of the staff make each guest feel very special and I really don't think you can ask much more - it's taken as read that with this standard of hotel the service, cleanliness, food, etc will be first class, which it is. However, don't all rush…"
February 2015,Living like royalty,"we stayed with our children (7&9 year old girls) and only had positive experiences. The staff was extremely warm and welcoming on arrival and the concierge team was very helpful throughout our stay in London. The restaurant at the hotel was first rate and the high tea was something our girls will soon not forget. The hotel location was ideal across the street from Kensington Gardens a few minute walk to several museums, shopping, restaurants and the tube. Every night we looked forward to receiving a small treat as part of the turn down service. We would definitely stay here again."
February 2015,WOW! This is the best hotel experience I have ever had,"I have worked in hotels and food & drink for a long time now and I have never, ever experienced service like I experienced last night from anyone - full stop.  Every member of staff that I came into contact with knew my name. Plus the (small) big things like the soap selections in the room, quality of brands on show and how guest centric the entire hotel is. It was just incredible.  The team were outstanding - Ben, Augustine (sorry if I got that one wrong), Leona, Marianne, The Concierges, the doormen. Every single one of them is a gem. Knowledgable, helpful, interested in you all with a nothing is too much trouble attitude.  A special mention goes to the restaurant and bar. I have to say the scallops and the steak are the best I have ever had, hands down. The wine selection was…"
February 2015,Flawless!,"Flawless experience in London.  Fantastic location and service in every domain was excellent.  Large room for London with nice amenities.  The ""welcome drink"" in the bar was a nice touch and much needed after traveling for over 12 hours.  Beautiful hotel, we will certainly return."
January 2015,Prince Albert Suite! always and forever,"We arrived in a Bentley, and were treated like kings! we were celebrating our 5th anniversary and  our check in staff, his name was Jose, he was absolutely welcoming and seamless in the process. He indiciated our room was one of the best and proceeded for our bags to be taken up whilst we enjoyed a glass of Moscato, which is my favourite.  Arriving into our palatial suite, we hard our jaws hit the floor, it was certainly worth every penny. The views i wouldve gladly killed for, my bedroom was bigger than my living room at home and the bath, i wanted to drown happily aha!  We informed them we liked to entertain a few friends for a dinner party, they couldnt be more obliging! set up the table in a most efficient and classy fashion. As our guests arrived, each were handed a glass…"
February 2015,The WOW factor,"A beautiful hotel with a fantastic history, the attention to detail and the attentiveness and welcoming given by the staff was second to none.  Just opposite Kensington Gardens, a fantastic location too."
February 2015,"OK, this is really good!",This was our second time at the Milestone and we loved it the first time.  We were upgraded to a suite with a spectacular view of the Hyde Park and Kennsington Palace directly across the street.  The staff is simply great...I am amazed they can remember my name!  The room was impeccable.  Just a really great time in London.
February 2015,WOW...NOT EVEN CHECKED IN YET,"I am compelled to write a review on how exceptional the concierge Jose has been.  I am staying at the hotel in two weeks but have corresponding back and forth with hotel since December.  No request has been too small and I have been a royal pain.  Jose has gone above and beyond in not just answering questions but doing research and getting back to me.  For example,  my daughter is doing a semester abroad and was in need of a dentist for her wisdom tooth.  I emailed Jose and a few minutes later I had a dentist.  He also arranged wonderful theatre seats for me showing me the location of the seats and kindly holding the seats for a day until I could finalize plans.  In fact, the theatre seats were better than platinum concierge could get for me with NO upcharge.   I haven't even…"
February 2015,Outstanding afternoon tea,"We had not booked a stay at this hotel, but arranged an afternoon tea to celebrate a Significant Birthday of my wife!  From our arrival, we could not have been looked after any better.  The service (provided by Alexandre and his colleague) was very attentive, but unobtrusive - we felt that our needs were carefully monitored, but we were left to enjoy our celebration without undue interruption.  The sandwiches, scones and cakes were very obviously freshly prepared, and the cakes were carefully explained (which added to their delicious quality).   Our tea cups were replenished  as soon as they were empty, and pot of fresh tea brought to our table without our having to ask.   We did not feel in the least bit hurried.   The last remaining three or four cakes, which had defeated us…"
February 2015,Full of suprises,"We booked this hotel as we had some work to attend to in London, where we normally stay around Marylebone area. Well, we will definitely be back to this hotel, from the moment we checked in we was made to feel more than welcome, with a drink offered in the conservatory whilst our room was being prepared, then when we got shown to our room, it was lovely, well proportioned, and very well decorated. I would recommend an evening meal at this hotel, as not only is the food very nice, and well priced (especially for London) the pianist was exceptional :) we had a very good night with him, and after dinner decided to return to our room, as we had, had a long day of travelling, etc, and we thought the pianist had retired for the evening, as we had not heard him for around 10 minutes,…"
February 2015,Very mixed feelings,"Positive: The hotel was booked as a Valentine day celebration and with the upgrade to the Princess Suite 501 we thought that everything is going to be amazing.  Certainly the hotel knows how to welcome you from the moment you step out of the taxi: friendly and polite faces willing to show you around or taking care of your smallest of needs.  We passed a rather boring corridor on the 5th floor to be welcomed by the most beautiful suite (facing the back of the building, which is very quiet) I have seen in a hotel: a very large sitting area (as per my pictures), you do not know where to look first.  Every single corner has small touches and not decorated sparsely as would be the case with other hotels: you have little pillows, statues, China,  paintings, orchids etc besides the…"
January 2015,A must stay,"Loved our stay - this hotel was great value for our 2 nights  in London and really well located.  Room was very nice - clean, modern and comfy.A truly first class Hotel with all the genuine service you'd expect, particularly in the City of London. Staff were friendly and Service levels was excellent  We will return without doubt, well done, keep up your very high standards."
January 2015,Stables bar,"I've frequented this hotel many times, and I always write a shining review and the Milestone genuinely is my favourite hotel in London. However I had never tried the Stables bar, and I'm so glad I did. I love a relaxed atmosphere, especially after the hustle and bustle of London. The Stables bar is furnished exquisitely, and the ambiance is lovely with soft music, and they dim the lights at a certain time. I had a few drinks here and the fruit salad with ice cream. Once again I highly recommend the Milestone to anyone visiting London, it truly is a magical experience. I cannot compliment the staff enough, I honestly leave feeling like a king every time."
August 2014,Very very very nice,"Really a fantastic hotel in London. Close to everything, amazing interior design and impecable service across all employees. We stayed here for the weekend and ejoyed it a lot! I would recommend this hotel to everyone without a doubt."
December 2014,Fantastic Hotel,"As regular customers of other Red Carnation Group hotels we thought we would ""keep it in the family"" by staying at the Milestone on a recent family trip to London. We are so glad we did.  We were welcomed, checked in, sorted out, pampered, fed and watered in the best possible way.  Everyone at this hotel was great. I would highly recommend this hotel and I will definitely stay there again.  The location is superb too and there are endless dining opportunities within a close radius."
December 2014,Two days of utter bliss,"Beautiful hotel.  Tons of character. Perfectly located for Kensington Palace and the shops along Kensington High street. The real stars of this hotel are the staff: Fabricio, Ben, Josh  and Teddy to name but a few.. Everyone made me feel so welcome. My two pooches also came along - talk about spoilt rotten: the hotel provides pet beds, towels, toys, pet food and doggy room service if required!! The pets can use 90% of the hotel, but there are restricted areas, which is perfectly fine, for this class of hotel.  The rooms are glamourous - maybe not to everyone's taste, but I love their OTT fabrics and furnishings....  The bathroom was spotless.. The room and maid service was excellent. The food in the hotel was delicious... breakfast was pricey but extremely plentiful...    This…"
December 2014,Wonderful stay,"Stay here for two nights over Christmas.  Met all expectations!  We were upgraded on arrival to two bedroom suite, which was great with kids.  Milestone made stay extra special with many, many special touches.  Many thanks to the Milestone staff for the memorable stay."
December 2014,A Perfect Stay,"Our first stay at this wonderful hotel lived up to the great reviews by others!  The staff at check-in could not have been nicer. We appreciated the early check-in which helped us tolerate our jet lag.  Loved the room with and all its nice little touches and the view of Kensington Palace. Everyone on the staff was pleasant, very competent, and helpful.  This hotel is in a wonderful location, and we enjoyed long walks in every direction."
December 2014,Pampered to perfection,"I cannot say enough great things about this hotel!  From the moment we arrived, we were impressed with the friendly and efficient greeting by the doorman, the front desk staff and Nick the butler. My husband and I stayed in the lovely room 509 and our two teen daughters were in the equally charming room 505. The hotel has achieved the perfect balance of traditional Victorian elegance and charm mixed with modern comforts, technology and convenience in the rooms and bathrooms. Delicious treats were found in both rooms each day. Breakfast in the cozy dining room was superb, whether you order a full English breakfast or simply the continental buffet. One tiny complaint was that during the four days we stayed at the hotel, our family could only eat breakfast together once as there…"
December 2014,Milestone Hotel,"Happy New year to the Milestone again and thank you for making our New Year special yet again. My Re-View 2008 you would think that i would need to write a complete new one on the Hotel yet they cease to amaze me from the first point of arrival to leaving was excellent so if you need to feel special go spoil your self with Fab surroundings and Staff that make you feel so welcome so please go and enjoy time out from normal life my thanks to all the staff that took the time to make it special,  Well were do i begin we stayed at the milestone hotel from the doorman to the housekeeping we was treated as if we was royalty we stayed new years eve and woww what a room it overlooked the park all the little fiinishing touches was fantastic from fluffy pillows to new year stockings how…"
November 2014,Wonderful week in a family apartment,"We stayed in the William and Kate apartment, and it was perfect for our family of 2 adults and 2 teenagers. We appreciated having 2 bedrooms, a sitting room, and kitchen.   What makes the Milestone so special, though, is the outstanding service from the staff. Housekeeping was impeccable, especially considering the size of the apartment. We also received outstanding service from the concierge desk on an almost daily basis. I can't praise the concierge team enough.  We ate breakfast one morning at the hotel restaurant, and it was delicious. We also enjoyed our afternoon tea in the lounge.  I would highly recommend the Milestone to anyone, especially families for the apartment option."
October 2014,You won't be disappointed!,"We recently took our first trip to London celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. The Milestone is a small hotel with fantastic personal service and an amazing staff. Colin picked us up from the airport in the hotel's range rover and his wonderful warm welcome set the tone for the whole stay. The restaurant provides an intimate and lovely dining experience, and the bar was fun. When we returned to our room the first night  whole place was sprinkled with rose petals! Milestone, if you are reading this...... Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
October 2014,"Awesome Service, Great Room, Excellent Atmosphere!","We just got back from a 6 night stay at The Milestone Hotel and are still in awe of the experience that we had. This was our first time being in London.  We booked our stay through Costco for our trip to see the Lions accidentally beat the Falcons (yay!).  Our concierge service was outstanding, EVERY question that we had was answered and pleasantly handled...even the most mundane questions. When you're there make sure to seek out Andrea as he took a little more interest in us (he has Michigan ties).  The room was beautiful and very quiet. The cleaning staff was beyond reproach and just as helpful and friendly as everyone else.  Our package also included a Daily English Breakfast, which was great. The main restaurant, Cheneston's, was outstanding. We had dinner there our first…"
October 2014,Up for a show,We came up to London for a show at the Albert Hall and stayed a night at the Milestone.  This is a special place in London as it it quite a small hotel but the service really is first class.  The staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble.  We were shown around by Pedro when we arrived (thank you) and later in the evening enjoyed an excellent meal  served early as we wanted to eat before the show.  I think the hotel is good value considering the location and the city.  We will definitely stay here again.  One thing to note - I was concerned  about noise in the night as we live in an extremely quiet rural area - I should not have worried the room is well insulated from the nightime city life !
October 2014,Great Stay at The Milestone,"My wife and I stayed at The Milestone from Oct 9-12th then again on October 25th for one night around a cruise from South Hampton. Great all around experience and location, our stay was outstanding. Special thanks to Steven at the front door who was a great help and a terrific chap and Benjamin in the bar who we enjoyed very much spending time with. We expect to be back in May."
October 2014,A hidden Gem in London,"We were recently guests at this hotel and if this was our first stay it definitely will not be our last! Incredibile personnel who treat you like friends and not just a number as other renowned hotels do.  We stayed in room 604 which was impressively decorated.  We had the opportunity of dinning twice at the hotel restaurant which I highly recommend.  Also do not hesitate to spend time in the hotel bar where servcie is more than outstanding. More still, do leave some spare time to enjoy the hotel afternoon tea.  We will be visiting London again in December and although I will not have the opportunity of staying at The Milestone, I intend to go for drinks, afternoon tea and dinner during my stay.  Thank you all for making our short break in London memorable."
September 2014,"Charming Hotel, Great Location, Excellent Staff",My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at The Milestone during a recent London trip. It was highly recommended by friends and it certainly lived up to all the wonderful things we had been told.  The rooms were lovely and spacious and the amenities were above and beyond expectations.  The Manager and Staff made our stay our stay exceptional and were available and met all our requests and treated us royally from the time of our check in to the time of our departure and all time in between. I would definitely stay here again and agree with the other reviewers and their comments.
September 2014,My stay at The Milestone was simply splendid!,"I vacationed at The Milestone/London with my 2 daughters and from the moment of arrival until our day of departure, we were treated like royalty. Truly, this is how the staff made us feel. Upon arrival we were met with complimentary tea & biscuits because our room was not yet ready. Served with real China and a fully-suited wait-staff. Our room was exactly as it was pictured on their website. Our bed was incredibly cozy & comfortable even the twin bed that was so smartly situated at the end of our bed was comfy! I paid for a fruit basket to be in the room and because it was not there upon arrival, there was no charge! Each night we had ""turn-down"" service in which slippers were placed bedside, and candies on the bed (we looked forward to the candies every night), a fresh red…"
October 2014,"Enchanting, cosy, splendidly located London hotel!","Having stayed in several London five star hotels in the past it was indeed a pleasure to have tried the Milestone Hotel. Located just across the road from Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park and seconds away from the fashionable Kensington High Street, this hotel enjoys an enviable location which is very central and yet away from the maddening crowds, noise, traffic and congestion of other more supposedly fashionable areas in London. The hotel's rooms are all individually decorated and furnished and although, as in other London hotels, they tend to be on the smallish side, they are very tastefully finished with rich drapes and soft furnishings and a wonderfully comfortable bed. The room enjoyed all modern amenities and the bathroom was blessed to have a window leading to the fresh air…"
October 2014,A truly memorable stay!,"This is the first time writing a hotel review in many years of travel but felt that our stay at The Milestone was so memorable that we had to make comments.  As other reviewers have written, it is truly a special property with wonderful staff.  Would highly recommend!!!"
October 2014,Best hotel in London,"We have stayed at the Milestone Hotel for many years now. We have also stayed at numerous 5 star hotels such as The Ritz, The Westbury, The Langham, Claridges, Mandarin Oriental to name a few. The Milestone is still our favourite by far.   We stayed there in 2011 for the first time to test run the hotel before we booked it for our wedding. We did not mention it at the time for this reason, we wanted to see how it would all go without the hotel knowing we would have numerous rooms booked. However, it made no difference - their level of service is not determined by the room type, money spent or how busy they are at the time. It is flawless regardless. Nothing was to much trouble.   We came back again to book for our wedding the following year. We booked 7 rooms/suites for 2 nights…"
September 2014,A lovely stay.,"We stayed at the Milestone for a few nights during our wedding in September. Unfortunately the room wasn't quite ready so our suitcases were safely stored for us and we went shopping. On our return our cases were taken to our room and we settled in. We were located on the 3rd floor in a deluxe studio room overlooking the park. The room had nice proportions, was very clean and had a very comfortable bed. During our stay the concierge Jose and head door man Stephen were very helpful and engaging. They helped with getting taxis, arranging bar space and champagne for our few guests and travel information. Breakfast was very good and the service excellent. We had previously stayed at the another Red carnation hotel in Mayfair, the Chesterfield but this is much better. We really…"
July 2014,Elegance with Warmth,"A spectacular hotel in a spectacular location hugging the corner of Hyde Park. However, what made my stay memorable is the level of care and attention I received from every person working at the Milestone. Not once did I feel the warmth was artificial or officially demanded by their job. People seemed extremely proud to be a part of what makes this hotel great."
September 2014,London at its best,"Classic old world style European hotel with luxurious accomodations, a knowledgeable and gracious staff, and excellent geographic location for prime sightseeing. Convenient to world class shopping (walking distance) and the underground (""tube"") for more extended sightseeing.  Highly recommended."
September 2014,"Sophisticated, Superb Service, Simply Sensational","My Wife and I, along with our little Dog, Lizzy, have just returned home from our seventh stay at the fabulous Grade II listed Milestone Hotel which as usual, began with an amazing greeting from all staff present in the Lobby, all of whom we now know, love and respect. The usual complimentary 'Glass of Champagne' was delivered to our room, minutes after we settled in to enjoy another wonderful few days at our favourite hotel in the World. I've said before that the Milestone experience doesn't get better with each stay..as it is perfection from the first time out. Everything about the Milestone is superlative, topped off with the friendliest people who cannot do enough to serve and please you. Nothing is too much trouble, however small or demanding. I find myself using the…"
October 2013,FAVORITE OF AN INDEFATIGABLE TRAVELER,"I for one like to stay at a hotel that has the sensibilities of its culture in the decor. I like palace with immaculate and warm service ( Who needs snooty service when your miles away from home?) I love warm, old world charm and intimacy.  The Milestone is  fondly  noted as one of my favorite places, because it stands up to my criteria hands down.I would highly recommend it."
September 2014,Just Had to Post Again About this Fabulous Hotel!,"I've written about The Milestone a few times before but I feel compelled to be effusive again.   This is a quintessential London hotel right in the heart of Kensington.   Your neighbors across the street at Kensington Palace are Will and Kate!    I travel all over the world on business and The Milestone is my favorite hotel in the world.   Location, service, quality of rooms, dining, tea, ambience-- this place has it all.   If you need anything, the wonderful concierge will be at your service.    The bartender, Marko, is the best around and makes perfect martinis.  I love the rooms-- they are all different and unique.  Some of the standard rooms are pretty small so upgrade if you can for more comfort.     Greatness starts at the top so I have to assume they are extremely…"
October 2013,Lovely Afternoon Tea at The Milestone,"On our first trip to London, we tried to get reservations at the more well-known tea places, but were unable to land a spot; so, we booked The Milestone for Afternoon Tea instead.  Tea was served in a small charming room with a few tables, sofas and chairs off the lobby. The service was excellent, with a nice selection of teas. Our waiter efficiently and gracefully kept replenishing out tea.  The petite finger sandwiches were good, the scones with Devonshire cream, excellent, with quite a nice selection of pastries.   This is not a place to see and be seen, rather a place to come with dear friends or family, relish the quiet intimate atmosphere.  This was our first tea in London, so we are not able to compare it to other places; but, we enjoyed our afternoon here, and, would…"
September 2014,"Service, service, service","If you want a large modern hotel, this is not the place for you. If you want big and modenrn go to the Shangri La Hotel at the Shard.  However, if you want a quintessential small English inn experience, this is the place.  I felt like Bono at the Milestone - total rockstar treatment.  My only regret is that our stay was not longer.  Our room was small but immaculately appointed and clearly recently immaculately redone; I gave four stars, not five, on the rooms, however, because the size of the room was quite small.  The mattress and linens were divine.  Did I mention the great service?"
September 2014,Unexpected service,"I chose to stay at the Milestone for my last night in London. I picked the hotel because it was close to Paddington and the restaurant I wanted to dine at (Petrus). From the minute you walk in, you feel a warm welcome. I had stayed at another Red Carnation hotel (the Oyster Box in Durban) and had the same experience. The service is exceptional. From the welcome drink in the conservatory to the turn down service in the evening, everything was impeccable. It was also an ideal location right next to Hyde Park. I would definitely recommend the hotel to others and would be likely to return."
July 2014,Fabulous find!,"Over the top service, quintessentially British boutique hotel.  Beautiful room, sublimely comfortable bed, unbelievable buffet breakfast.  We enjoyed the hotel's private airport car service---definitely take advantage of that.  We were traveling with our 12 year old granddaughter, and really appreciated the bedroom with separate private sleeping area for her, and the most delicious chocolate birthday cake they delivered to our room for her birthday.  Hotel is convenient to tube station a couple of blocks away, and is not far from Harrod's.  Concierge arranged restaurants for us, shipped luggage back to the US for our son who had studied in London all summer, and even helped with arrangements for us in Italy, where we were headed when we left London!  Lots of small thoughtful…"
November 2014,Five Star in Every Way,"We chose to stay at The Milestone after reading the rave TripAdvisor reviews  to celebrate a special birthday for my wife and wanting somewhere near to the Royal Albert Hall as we had booked for Classical Spectacular there.  The hotel was superb with excellent decor and furnishings and the service, helpfulness and friendliness of the staff couldn't be faulted.  In  particular I would single out Andrea, the concierge, who went to endless trouble to secure a tour of the Albert Hall for us at quite short notice.  We stayed three nights and had an afternoon tea one day and dinner in the restaurant another evening in addition to breakfast each day and, again, it was all top notch which, of course, it should be in a 5* hotel.  If you are looking for really top class service and, like…"
November 2014,Royal Albert Hall Visit,"My darling husband booked this hotel for a surprise for me. When we arrived we were greeted and told at check in we had been upgraded to a deluxe room. Then given a tour of the hotel, before being shown to our room by a lovely gentleman ( PEDRO ). The glass of champagne on arrival was just bliss. We attended the Royal Albert Hall for a show. Knowing we were going back to the milestone was the icing on the cake to finish off a wonderful romantic day. Breakfast before leaving was exceptional. Words fail me to continue, all that's left to say is, WE WILL BE BACK MRS JOANNE GAGE"
January 2014,Milestone Hotel,"This is a wonderful place to stay for a peaceful and luxurious retreat from the city bustle. My husband and I stayed at this marvelous hotel in late August 2003 (honeymoon). We were upgraded to a beautiful room (310) overlooking Kensington Gardens and were thrilled to find flower and chilled champagne awaiting us. The service was consistenly perfect: staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Bathrooms with beautiful caramel marble and Penhaligons toiletries! This hotel is small enough to feel cozy, but it is definitely a luxury hotel in every sense (Leading Hotels of the Wordl and Five Star Dimandon Award)."
December 2013,Great Christmas Stay!,"Our family stayed here for the week of Christmas.  The staff were friendly, professional and very helpful.  We had a ""Christmas tea service"" on Christmas Eve and it was incredible.  We had a Christmas tree in our room that they decorated and they even delivered us Christmas presents.  Great location too - we walked across the street and strolled through Kensington Park on several occasions."
November 2014,MJR- my recent stay at The Milestone Hotel,"Having stayed previously at the Milestone Hotel we wanted a hotel in the area that fulfilled all our requirements. With good memories from our earlier visit the rebooking decision was straightforward. Often a revisit never matches the first visit but this hotel is so different with such  depth to all its services and qualities. Reluctant to leave, we are already thinking of a reason to arrange a future stay when in London as The Milestone Hotel really does specialise in quality and addictive indulgence."
October 2014,Clearly the BEST Boutique Hotel in London,"I highly recommend the Milestone Hotel for their excellent service, décor and food.  From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave there are friendly staff, who know your name, and are committed to attending to your every need.  I was personally greeted by Andrew, the General Manager, who made me feel more at home.  Being an avid National Trust member, Andrew personally gave me a tour of the hotel, showing me all of the wonderful rooms and services that I could enjoy during my visit. Although small, the hotel has everything you could expect for a 5star establishment, a well equipped gym and personal trainer service, spa, swimming pool, and many areas to enjoy fine or casual dining.  I personally enjoyed listing to the skilled pianist!  During my visit I very much enjoyed…"
November 2014,Commitment to excellent service,"I highly recommend the Milestone Hotel for their excellent service. From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave there are friendly staff, who know your name, and are committed to attending to your every need, from concierge, to dining to business and relaxation services. You can't go wrong with this excellent and impeccably decorated hotel. Jamie Turkington"
September 2014,"Best in London, outstanding service, rooms, location","I have stayed in The Milestone many times. One year I was their most frequent visitor. My favorite hotel, certainly in London. Directly at Hyde Park in South Kensington it has a really nice location. All rooms are individually decorated, all in old English style. You will love them even though the rooms are small. Staff is very attentive. I love the place."
November 2014,Amazing Stay,"I stayed here on the 01 November as a present to my wife, the hotel staff and service was superb. they even baked a cake for her at no extra charge. The breakfast is very good, highly recommend the eggs benedict....cannot fault the room and they have full sky tv !!"
November 2014,My favourite Hotel anywhere,"This is the third time I have stayed at the Milestone and I did not think it could get better, but every time it does.  The staff are so dedicated and warm.  The service is unobtrusively excellent.  The food is delicious.  The ambiance is perfectly British in the very best sense.  It is cosy, comfortable, discrete, and I would stay for weeks if I could. Thanks to all the wonderful staff under the leadership of Andrew Pike.  Hope to see you again.  Helen Zille"
August 2014,Superb 5 Star Experience,"We just returned home from an 8 day trip to London where my husband and two teen sons stayed at The Milestone Hotel.  From the time of my reservation inquiry through our departure, we could not have asked for a better experience.  The reservation and front desk staff responded to all my communications in a prompt and courteous manner, and the hotel staff including the concierges and housekeeping staff were amazing during our stay.  The entire staff was kind and helpful and genuinely interested in making certain we had a wonderful stay.  My son celebrated his 14th birthday during our stay and they delivered a birthday cake to his room!  The rooms and the decor of the hotel is very charming old English, and the bathrooms are lovely and modern. My sons enjoyed the workout room as…"
August 2014,Perfect yet again,"I've lost count of the number of times we have stayed here. And it's always a total delight.  The rooms are comfy and stylish.  The public areas of the hotel are welcoming and invite you to linger.  The staff are all, and I mean all, polite, friendly, attentive and excellent at what they do.  I can recommend the spicey Bloody Mary's in the bar, served with amazing yummy nibbles.  The only negative point is my own fault - one night was not enough! I need to stay longer."
November 2013,Possibly one of the best hotels in the UK? Even the world?,"As a frequent traveller to London, I've stayed in numerous hotels - from low budget to supposedly luxury. I actually booked the Milestone almost by mistake, as I'd left it too late and couldn't find anywhere else nearby. From the moment I arrived I was absolutely blown away - by the service and the quality of the entire place. It's like no hotel I've ever stayed in... It was clear we had arrived somewhere special when - at nearly 11pm, when tired and weary from a long journey, a man knocked on my room door dressed in a pristine white suit, brandishing a complimentary glass of champagne to welcome me. On my bed was a 'pillow menu' listing about 15 different types of pillow that I could request for the bed!  Every last detail of the room was sheer luxury, from the hand-written…"
June 2014,Felt Like Royalty,"This Hotel was amazing!! It's a boutique hotel, so remember that when you visit. You wont get a commercial hotel feel at all. Everything is vintage to the hotels history, and the coolest thing is that all the rooms are decorated differently. We stayed in the Kensington Garden Suite, which had a living room downstairs with a very comfortable pull out couch, and a Beautiful master suite upstairs. The bathroom was so luxurious with very nice big bottles of shampoo, conditioner, bubble bath, and lotion. Elegant Bath shower combo with Gold fixtures. The bathroom even had a bidet! Being in our 20's we spent a lot of time getting ready to go out on the town. The bathroom comfortably fit two us in their at a time and there was also a vanity and mirror in the bedroom. Just remember to…"
August 2014,It's like coming home....,"Probably one of the best hotels in the word. We go here whenever we get the chance to go to London. Awesome location, exceptional service. Absolutely perfect in every regards. We are looking forward to our next visit there. We can absolutely recommend this great hotel. "
April 2014,No 1,"Number one on TripAdvisor and you can see why. Very warm, friendly welcome. Cosy rooms, great bars. Only issue is location. Great for sightseeing or shopping but if you want the west end you end up spending a fortune on taxis but overall a very very pleasant stay."
July 2014,A wonderful experience.,The Milestone is a beautiful hotel in a delightful part of London. The facilities were truly excellent and the staff could not have been more helpful or courteous. A hotel to revisit without doubt and I will not hesitate in returning.
October 2013,Had such a wonderful time are returning for a second visit,We traveled once again to London last year and stayed at the Milestone.  All of the Tripadvisor comments were great and we were not disappointed.  From the friendly staff to a wonderful birthday dinner.  The hotel is conveniently located within easy walking distance to the Tube or the buses.  We will be renting an apartment this time around when we stay in again later this year.  The rooms are elegantly appointed.
May 2014,The best kept secret in London,"This was an amazing property.  The staff is extremely professional and goes above and beyond to make your stay very pleasurable. We had a minor problem with our room and it was resolved in a matter of minutes with a very nice surprise for us.  The food was excellent and the pub was spot on with bartender and service.  You will not be disappointed with your stay at this upscale property.  Great location across the street from Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, near the tube."
July 2014,Yes it is the BEST!,"We are regular’s here. We only stayed one night, 2 rooms me, my wife and daughter, this establishment is exceptional! In our opinion competes directly with the Savoy! Different but level of attention to detail and professionalism are there like no other. We invited a friend for dinner in the restaurant same levels of service and quality as we always get. I don’t want to go on but this facility is exceptional, faultless. Another great stay!"
August 2014,Extraordinary experience!,"We have traveled world wide and have found the Milestone to be, by far, the most exquisite boutique hotel in our experience. The property is well located with views of Kensington Palace and across the street from Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens with lots of fun play areas for children. Each guest room is unique and tastefully decorated.  But what makes this such a wonderful hotel is the staff. Your are greeted at the door by welcoming bellmen who escort you into the beautiful lobby and are further greeted by an exceptional front desk staff.  The concierges, Jose, Andrea and Joshua  and the butler, Fran, go above and beyond to help you navigate your way through London and beyond and can answer any questions you might have with such professionalism.  They are truly remarkable. …"
September 2014,Fantastic stay,"Great food, clean rooms and top notch service can not find 1 single fault with this hotel, i was here on business but will be returning shortly. The hotel itself is in a great location for visiting the Kensington Palace which was good it gave me the opportunity to take in some local history. The restaurant is excellent i would recommend it. Thanks Fran for the great service!"
September 2014,A Gem in the heart of Kensington!,I cannot rate this hotel highly enough. A gorgeous building in the heart of Kensington that has so much charm and tradition within.  We had a very warm welcome given to us and the service throughout our stay was exceptional. Staff were lovely and so so helpful. The attention to detail in the rooms are of the highest standard. I  Would stay here at The Milestone Hotel over and over again.
August 2014,Wonderful experience,"We had a wonderful stay at the Milestone Hotel in London.The hotel is in a great location for visiting Kensington Palace,good shops nearby and lovely views overlooking Kensington Gardens. We were welcomed by a very courteous  member of concierge Fran who showed us around the hotel before showing us to the Regency suite. This was a most luxurious suite overlooking Kensington Gardens.There were various luxurious items for our use laid around the room. We had drinks in the beautiful conservatory after dinner with our family and enjoyed the ambience there very much. The staff in the hotel could not have made us more welcome and this made my birthday weekend there very memorable. Highly recommended."
September 2014,5 Star Service,"This is a small intimate hotel in a great location near Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. It is in walking distance from shopping and dining options. The Hotel has intimate common areas in which to relax, read or visit with other guests. The restaurant is excellent .  I strongly recommend you have a dinner there. A generous breakfast is included each morning if you book directly with the hotel. The entire Hotel staff is amazing!  They go above and beyond fulfilling your requests. It is obvious they enjoy their jobs and are invested in making your visit a special one."
August 2014,Wonderful hotel in London.,"Great staff. Great location. Gorgeous, fabulous decor. Very comfortable. Food was excellent. Loved the little Winston Churchill quotes book they left on the pillow as well as all the little treats. Worth the price."
August 2014,It was a wonderful experience,"Though the rooms are a bit small everything else is grand; the staff, the amenities; the breakfast and the desire to please . Everything was personalized and the concierge was excellent. The glass conservatory is a wonderful place for a drink, and the afternoon touches of fruit or scones are lovely to come home to."
August 2014,An excellent London hotel,"This is a really ""nice"" hotel.  The staff are warm and friendly, the decor perfect.  My wife arrived back from shopping in a cab to find she only had ""Old Pounds"" the doorman quickly paid the cab driver and took care of the problem.   The atmosphere is English, calm and understated, you don't feel as if you are in chain hotel that could be anywhere."
July 2014,Best Five Star Experience Ever!,"From the moment we arrived, I knew we'd ""arrived."" We were very early, but they changed our original room to one that would be ready much sooner and offered us tea and biscuits in the lovely front parlor.  Our room was unusual with bathroom on one level and bedroom a few steps up, but lovely bedding and decor.  Loved the different pillow treats each turndown.  Our breakfasts were delicious served in a charming dining room with a fireplace (no need for extra warmth in July though). The bar was so British library. I'm sorry I didn't have time for a drink there.   Our favorite doorman, Stephen, made us feel safe while we watched a 25K person protest on our street.  Very interesting to see something like that for us small town Texas women.    If I ever get back to London I hope I…"
August 2014,Good central location,"We've just returned from a lovely 3 day break in London and can highly recommend it. Giles warmly welcomed us, and there were many thoughtful touches. For example, I asked at breakfast the first day for maple syrup and it arrived on day two!"
July 2014,5 star plus!,My husband and I stayed at the Milestone last week and had a truly amazing experience. The location is perfect for seeing the city but the real gem here is the exceptional personal attention and service from the staff. They remember your name and do everything they can to make your stay perfect. The restaurant and bar is great with an attentive professional staff that is well trained about the food and drinks they provide. We had excellent restaurant and theatre recommendations. We noticed that laundry services was available Monday through Saturday and of course it was Sunday and we were leaving the next morning and really needed some laundry done. The staff had no problem getting it done for us in house. They literally couldn't do enough to make our stay perfect and the…
March 2014,Family,"As we came to The Milestone Hotel we were greeted pleasantly and not looked down on for having 3 children! We had 2 rooms and boy were good, fabulous for space, and the children were allowed to do pretty much anything, not restricted at all. However, I am making this hotel look like a mad mans house with children running everywhere! It wasn't at all like that, behaviour was also on the cards. Due to the hotel looking posh and actually being posh made children become very quiet and well behaved."
July 2014,Exceptional Staff,This was our first visit to London.  After extensive research we chose the Milestone and we were not disappointed. We arrived early in the morning after our flight from Toronto and to our surprise our room was ready.   Our particular room 502 was small and somewhat awkwardly laid out but once we got past that we were able to enjoy the attention to detail and unique beauty of the charming rooms in this quaint hotel.  What truly distinguished this hotel for us was the staff.  Each was incredibly pleasant and focused on ensuring our stay was enjoyable.  The full English breakfast which was part of our package was by far the best breakfast we have had throughout our European travels.  Once again the staff were friendly and charming. Although all are worthy of a mention we…
July 2014,"The Big ""If""...","The Milestone does have issues, e.g., electrical. But any issues are minor and well-taken care of by the cordial staff. So, If you are planning a London trip, and If you can afford it, then you can hardly go wrong in booking a stay at the Milestone."
July 2014,"Fabulous stay, with a few qualifiers...","The Milestone was our home for our first 6 nights on our London/Ireland journey.  Location and hotel services were near-perfect (can't beat the 3 min. walk from the Tube station and the numerous restaurants nearby).  Our Virtuoso package included FULL breakfasts everyday, and we definitely took full advantage (amazing cold buffet and beautiful cooked offerings, including baked cod, eggs benedict, etc.).  Our rooms (202/203) were a little cramped, but we had the constraint of needing 2 adjoining rooms to accommodate our 2 tween-age daughters - and I think they would've upgraded us (again, for the Virtuoso package) if rooms were available.  Rooms themselves were beautiful, if not spacious.  As we are an American family used to more of the spacious, do-it-yourself properties (think…"
July 2014,"Professionally Staffed Mansion in Kensington, Perfect in Every Way","Where does one begin?  Is it the fact that everyone, and I mean everyone, knows your name and your preferences? Or is it the fact that you know their names? Is it the fact that they anticipate your needs and that they clearly enjoy helping you solve your problems? It might be that they treat your 11 year-old daughter like she is one of their own children, and you can see the sparkle in her eyes with every interaction.  It might be that they are helping you make memories and that your family is welcome and cherished.  Could it be the fact that the General Manager and the Deputy General Manager and the Food and Beverage Manager and the Head Concierge and the Head Chauffeur and the Executive Head Housekeeper and the Front of House Manager are ever present and convivial and…"
July 2014,London Vacation,"The Milestone Hotel was the perfect choice for my recent London vacation. The entire staff catered to our needs on a daily basis. There was fresh fruit waiting for me when I returned from my day of sightseeing. The hotel is beautiful, the staff goes above and beyond and the entire experience was more than excellent. I highly recommend this hotel for your next trip to London."
July 2014,Wonderful Afternoon Tea treat for my daughter's birthday,"I booked this princess afternoon tea special treat for my daughter via  email and this was confirmed promptly. We were greeted courteously at the main door and shown into a delightful elegant room. They made my daughter feel like a real princess and they even served her a cupcake with candle on a decorated plate with 'Happy Birthday' with a piano playing the birthday tune in the background.  It was absolutely wonderful. If you let The Hotel know in advance, the princesses can also decorate a cupcake, which was a lovely touch also.  I have been to the Ritz and although on a smaller scale, the staff here were equally as professional and attentive.  Thank you to all the staff at the Milestone Hotel for making our birthday girl and trip to London extra special."
July 2014,great hotel!,great hotel very nice room great service cannot find anything wrong about it really worth it to go there!! very nice location and place where you willspend great time relax and staff is extremly nice higlhy recommended
July 2014,Exquisite afternoon tea,"I arrived at The Milestone hotel, after a long walk from South Kensington. I underestimated the walk and I was left feeling quite out of breath. As soon as I arrived at The Milestone, I was greeted by the doorman, and then upon arrival into the reception I was promptly shown into the park lounge. I was seated in a beautiful position, in front of a large painting, which I have tried to capture in the photo I have taken. The décor is honestly what dreams are made of, I honestly cannot fault it.   The Milestone is a member of The Red Carnation group, and I have had afternoon at The Egerton House hotel before which again was lovely, so there is something The Red Carnation group are doing that others are simply missing! Unfortunately I have forgotten all names of the servers, but I…"
July 2014,Great London Hotel,The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding.  Across from Hyde Park. Consider getting the two bedroom apartment instead of two separate rooms. We will definitely stay there on our next London trip.
July 2014,Wonderful Experience,We stayed at the Milestone the second week of July and had a wonderful experience.  The location is terrific with easy access to public transportation.  The hotel itself is beautiful.  The service from the staff could not have been better.  We hope to stay here again in the years to come.
August 2014,Perfect in every way!,"We had our wedding celebration at The Milestone last weekend and it could not have been more perfect. From the welcome both we and our  guests received to the delicious food, service and accommodation we would not have changed anything. The hotel is in a fabulous location opposite Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and so has good transport links for central London as well as amazing views. We had great fun with Manvee  planning the event and we very grateful to Grant and Fabrizio for putting it all together on the day and making the room look amazing. These guys accommodated our every request with no problem or question. Every staff member we came across was friendly helpful and professional. The day was finished off perfectly when we went back to our room and found rose…"
August 2014,Outstanding,"I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world and The Milestone truly tops them all. My wife and I has 2 nights there on 13th and 14th August and were treated to an upgrade on arrival. The suite was beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough to help. It sounds like a cliche to say we were treated like royalty but I can think of no other way to describe it. From the doorman on our arrival, to the delightful reception ladies on check in, to Pedro who showed us around introducing us to all of the team, to the helpful concierge who arranged a car for us for an afternoon's sight seeing, to the barman who made us a special cocktail as we couldn't decide from the menu.....I could go on. The location of the hotel is literally opposite Kensington gardens and is also convenient…"
August 2014,Great hotel and great staff.,"We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is very nice, our room was perfect. The whole staff is very pleasant and friendly and knew us by name. The breakfast is excellent too! I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to London."
August 2014,Excellent choice for afternoon tea,"We had tea at the Milestone and it was fabulous. The ambiance and service were second to none. The tea was excellent and the sandwiches, cakes, and scones were beautiful and ever so tasty. I would love to stay at this lovely hotel the next time we are in London. It is an incredible property."
August 2014,Wonderful hotel where the staff goes above and beyond to meet your every request!,"We just completed a 3 night family vacation at The Milestone. The hotel is quaint and decorated as a beautiful English home. Each hotel room is decorated differently. We had two rooms and one was more beautiful then the other. The breakfast buffet is great with many options. Continental which included cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit ,assorted breads and pastries or order off a full menu.  The concierge planned our whole trip. Private tours, dinner and theatre tickets. Every choice was perfect! The staff all know your name the moment you arrive and can not do enough to help you.  We had a sick teenager one morning and Andrea ( the concierge) personally made phone calls for us and accompanied my husband to a pharmacy.  The personal service was the best we have experienced in any…"
July 2014,London's best home,"The Milestone is a unique experience in itself. The staff has an acute attention to your needs which makes you feel wellcome and at home. From the moment you arrive to when you leave you have everything is within reach.  We stayed for three nights and enjoyed every second of them. Details like extra thick glass in the rooms to block out traffic noise lets you sleep longer, a magnificent breakfast, the most friendly concierge and a lounge piano player who really knows his stuff made our stay unique.   The Milestone is our new home in London!"
August 2014,Suburb Afternoon Tea,"We had afternoon tea at the Milestone last year & it was suburb. This year we tried a different hotel for tea & while it was nice, it lacked the sophistication & special touches the Milestone offer. So, we went back to the Milestone for tea again this year. The staff are all very welcoming & friendly. They were helpful with the stroller & had a high hair for us. The kids each had their own pot of hot chocolate & their own mini tea tray, which they were thrilled with. Our adult tea was excellent, every item was delicious & beautifully presented. The champagne was also lovely. It'd be hard to try anywhere else for tea when the Milestone delivers such phenomenal food & service. "
July 2014,Simply the Best,"My husband and I stayed at the Milestone for 10 days in late July 2014, our third visit.  The Milestone is simply the best hotel in London.  Outstanding service, friendly and knowledgeable staff, the concierge team was outstanding, fast and very capable.  Be sure to take advantage of the various services offered, including the drivers, like Colin, who took us on a wonderful tour to Bath and Windsor Castle.  The Master Suite where we stayed was extremely luxurious and had anticipated every need and comfort as well as lots of extras mentioned in some of the other reviews.  The location cannot be improved--across the street from Kensington Palace with Kensington Gardens that adjoins Hyde Park--allows for a beautiful view as well as outstanding exercise and picnic opportunities. …"
May 2014,Best vacation ever,"Having recently stayed at the Milestone, I have to say this was the best experience ever. From the minute I stepped out of my taxi and was greeted by the very sweet doorman, who whisked my bags away, and handed me over to the lovely reception staff..I knew this was going to be an amazing experience. Upon checking in, I was informed that I had been upgraded to a beautiful master suite, the Prince Albert suite. It was quite funny that this was the suite I was assigned, because I had expressed to my family that this was my favorite on the website. So, I was extremely delighted. Fran, the butler, took me on a tour of the beautiful Cheneston restaurant, the Stables Bar, the Conservatory and the lovely parlor, where they serve a delicious tea. He then took me up to my suite, which was…"
May 2014,This hotel is excellent in every aspect!,"My friend and I and her son and my two sons and daughter (all boys age 9 and daughter age 8) stayed here for two nights.  It was an amazing experience in every way.  To begin with, I called many hotels in London and this was one of the few that would or could accommodate children with a rollaway bed.  Plus, I felt that they offered a reasonable rate compared to some other hotels.  Then when we arrived we could not believe how beautiful this ""boutique"" hotel was.  The rooms and especially the beds were so perfect and so comfortable, even the rollaway beds were given special attention.  They even left child-sized robes for our children and little gifts for them.  I also want to mention how amazing the service was at the hotel.  Jose, the concierge, arranged everything from…"
April 2014,memorable stay,We stayed here last month for our anniversary as a short break. The place is conveniently located and is a treat to be in. It was worth every penny and the staff and service and attention to detail especially the romantic package was excellent. The interiors were plush and luxurious and we just enjoyed everything about our stay. Very highly recommended and well worth the tripadvisor accolades from before. We will go back there soon.
May 2014,Unbelievable service!!!,What a great hotel!!! Just returned from a weekend stay with our dog and was so impressed with the high level of service. The staff made traveling with a dog so easy! They really went above and beyond in their personal attention shown towards us and our dog. The hotel oozes quality in every way and is from now on our go to hotel when visiting London!
May 2014,nice,"This hotel is just great! Small, stylish, very nicely maintained and furnished and perfectly located in the heart of London. All the rooms are different and the bar at the ground floor has a very charming bar man offering the ""best martinis in town"". The staff is very helpful and the rooms are just perfect. Nothing to complain about"
April 2014,"""Brilliant Stay!""","I came here with my friend.When we arrived we were welcomed by a friendly doorman.All the staff at the Milestone hotel made us feel very welcome.We stayed for a night and woke up and headed downstairs to breakfast it was delightful,we had a full English and were rather full after the delicious breakfast because we couldn't get enough of it.I would advise you to come and stay at the fantastic Milestone hotel.We would defiantly stay here again!!"
May 2014,"Classic, cozy and compact!",I booked the Romantic option: and was it romantic: xxx! Excellent position across from the Kensington Palace Gardens makes for relaxed strolling. Efficient reception and very professional service all round. Attention to detail in the rooms all add up to a great stay: home away from home. The Orangerie is pleasant for a light lunch and the bar is very welcoming with live music in the Library in the evening. Close enough to the Royal Albert Hall to stroll back after a performace. 
April 2014,Lovely stay," I've had the pleasure of staying recently at two of the 4 star red carnation hotels (Montague and Rubens) and so was really looking forward to the 5 star Milestone hotel.  The welcome is warm and friendly but surprisingly my room wasn't ready so it was off to the bar to wait with a complimentary drink.  The bar is great, Markus is very knowledgeable and mixes a mean margarita and although the wait was long it wasn't unpleasant. Unfortunately a couple of the hotel management were having a meeting in the bar and it would have been better it this had taken place in an office ( I really wasn't interested in the gentleman bemoaning the rates at the Rubens).  Dinner was fabulous but very expensive. I spoiled myself with the wagyu beef fillet which was great and the wine…"
May 2014,Excellent Stay,"Had a wonderful 5 night stay at the Milestone. The location was convenient and accessible to all the sights. Having the park across the street is so nice. I walked through it almost everyday. The staff was warm, friendly, and so helpful. We loved the turn down service in the evening. I have never been to a hotel with such exceptional service. This hotel is truly worth every penny."
April 2014,one night stay,From entering through the doors of The Milestone we were cared for so well by the very professional & attentive staff. Every request was dealt with efficiently and always with a smile. In the middle of London this hotel felt like a calm oasis. The décor beautifully traditional. Breakfast was ample and drinking in the bar a pleasure. We made the mistake of turning down a 'turn down' and then seeing our friends room who had. It looked magical. So fellow guests never ever refuse a 'turn down' at The Milestone !
May 2014,Exceptional in every way,"Quintessentially English hotel with Staff that are without a doubt some of the most professional, dedicated, polite and friendly hotel staff we have had the pleasure to meet.  Immediately we were at ease and relaxed.  Afternoon Tea was a delightful experience, our suite was outstanding - clean, plenty of space, beautifully dressed - and our Full English breakfast was second to none.  We will certainly be back!"
May 2014,Unsurpassable,"After a long and eventful journey, my wife and I arrived at the steps of the hotel to be greeted by a very helpful doorman. The check-in experience was something we had only ever experienced at Scottish country hotels; friendly and relaxed, but deceptively efficient. Pedro showed us around the hotel and some of its facilities before showing us to our room, and what a room! We had dinner in the restaurant on the first night and the food was first class, fresh and extremely tasty. A couple of drinks in the bar with a very attentive barman and then a perfect nights sleep.  The breakfast selection was amazing and they had my favourite Haddock and poached eggs, washed down with excellent coffee. An excellent breakfast that set us up for the day which began by walking out the front…"
June 2013,FOREVER,"Typical English hotel, very quaint and elegant, clean, tidy and the food was great!  The waiters are at the top of professionalism. . .  the treatment reserved for us is indescribable, just arrived we were served and revered. Top marks ..."
April 2014,Lovely,"My husband and I checked into the Milestone after spending 4 nights at the Savoy.  What a change of pace!  The Milestone was so quiet - almost a little too quiet but after 4 nights on the Strand it was wonderful to get away from that action.  We were upgraded to a very nice room overlooking Hyde Park.  We were only on the 3rd floor but the way that they have the windows insulated you can't hear the traffic on Kensington High St.  Amazing!   We didn't experience the ""incredible"" staff the way that many other reviewers experienced.  I don't know if it's because we are a younger couple (in our 30s) and it seems as though the hotel attracts older guests.  Regardless, all the doormen were fantastic.  Fran also made us feel very welcome.  And Jose at the concierge was able to find a…"
May 2014,simply wonderful in everything,"My husband and I spent 5 nights at the Milestone Hotel and everything about this hotel and the staff is simply wonderful. From the moment you walk up the front steps it's like being 'at home'. This is not an easy feat for any hotel but the Milestone is not like any other hotel.   The Milestone is a complete oasis in a very busy city. The staff are always expecting you and welcome you home.  The rooms are beautifully appointed and the bathrooms are fabulous. You never have to worry if you've packed everything because the Milestone will have it. The food is exquisite. I would highly recommend you have dinner at the hotel, and please try the pork. It was the highlight of our stay!  We were treated like royalty - the care and attention to detail is something everyone should have the…"
May 2014,Not quite as good as the reviews,"Having chosen this hotel due to its billing as the top one on tripadvisor we had high expectations of our stay. Whilst we had a good time, it did not live up to the hype.  On booking with the hotel you are sent an extensive and detailed questionnaire about your fruit, welcome drink, DVD preferences and room facilities that you would like to be available. Having taken the time to fill this in and email it back to them we arrived in our room to find that all of the requests had been ignored. There was no fruit (stated to be complimentary on the forms), no DVDs, no tea or coffee making facilities and no welcome drink although this was subsequently offered (they clearly didn't know what we had earlier requested).  There are several areas you are shown around and told that you can…"
April 2014,Wonderful Stay,"My adult daughter and I just completed a wonderful 3 night stay at The Milestone.  Every staff member we encountered - doormen, front desk, concierge, wait staff, housekeeping, the bartender - was pleasant and helpful in a sincere vs. professionally nice way.  We selected a package that included breakfast, enjoyed in a different spot each day - the library, dining room, and room service - such a treat.  We met friends for drinks in The Milestone bar before dinner - it's a unique space that offers a few different, all extremely comfortable options to sit, chat, and enjoy yourselves.  The Milestone's location was perfect for our goal of walking almost everywhere - and we tried as much as possible to make Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park part of our route.  It's not easy for a…"
April 2014,"Simply put, Magnificent, Great Staff!",We saved the Milestone for our last night In London since it was our 30th anniversary of our marriage. We made the right choice! We were given a lovely room overlooking the park. The underground was on strike when we were there but it did not matter. Because we were there to enjoy the park and this lovely hotel. Even though the Milestone is lovely from the top to the bottom. It is the hotel staff that makes this a wonderful experience. They address you by name. always have a warm hello. Will go out of their way to make sure you have a enjoyable stay. Thank you to all the fine people of Milestone. Cheers!
April 2014,Wonderful afternoon tea,"On the 27 01 14 we took our granddaughters out to tea at the Milestone for the little princess tea the girls really enjoyed it they thought it was very posh , the staff were all so kind to them  they so enjoyed decorating their cup cakes we also enjoyed the tea the cakes were delicious, Would recommend  and go again"
April 2014,Meeting or exceeding our highest expectations as couple's city getaway,"My wife and I spent very memorable 3 nights at The Milestone celebrating her birthday. We chose The Milestone because it was very highly rated and recommended and was located within of our area of interest. On few of our recent vacations we have sampled different kinds of luxury hotels, classic and boutique types (also in London). We had generated very high expectations for The Milestone knowing that the hotel itself would be a major part of our short vacation experience.  Now reflecting our vacation I must say that the wonderful staff and literally spotless premises of The Milestone really succeed. The vast amount of details that were ""just right"" is mindbogling. Where do I start: the premises, execution of classic luxury style, unique flavour in room decorations, the number of…"
July 2014,A gem of a hotel,"This hotel is like staying in a wonderful manor home.  The staff is exceptionally warm, courteous and helpful.  The location, across from Kensington  Gardens, is an oasis in the city of London.  Our room faced the Gardens and had a small lower level with a lounge and a second television.  The bathroom was good size with a great shower head in the tub/shower combination.  The High Street Kensington tube station was within easy walking distance."
July 2014,great experience,"i ve stayed in five stars hotel all over the world, and this is in the top 2, everything was just simply fantastic. They did everything to make my stay (with my family) unforgettable. i will stay there again any day"
July 2014,The Milestone Hotel,"Just returned from a week at The Milestone Hotel in London.  What a fabulous place to stay.  I felt like I was staying at a private manor, instead of a commercial hotel.  It was lovely, and the staff was so polite and accommodating that I felt like I was an important diplomat waiting to meet the Queen.  It was a perfect visit to London.  I loved the location of the hotel, across the street from Kensington Gardens, and walking distance to Harrods, shopping and some great restaurants.  Cabs were super easy to find, and the hotel food was actually one of the best places to eat in town.  I would highly recommend staying at The Milestone Hotel.  I usually stay at the Four Seasons in each city I visit, as I love being comfortable.  The Milestone is quite comparable to it in service…"
May 2014,Great Service BUT hot water and cramping issues in Room,"I stayed here 11-20 May in room 502. No doubt about it, everyone was exceptionally warm and informative but when I had to call maintenance about the lack of hot water the explanation was unacceptable for any hotel in this category. The technician told me the boiler was six floors below and that I should run it for ten minutes before using. Can you imagine the wasted water? They should have a booster DHW tank every two floors - especially considering its a hotel for goodness sakes. My room was so tiny they had doll house chairs - they were actually unsuitable to sit in for any adult by anyones standard. I've traveled the world and never have I seen such insultingly tiny chairs.When the bed was turned down for the night there was really no clear floor space distance without…"
August 2013,Classic Hotel,The Milestone is one of the best hotels to stay at in London. The services were excellent. Breakfast was delicious and a traveler feels like it is their home when staying there. We would definitely go back
June 2014,Another wonderful stay!,Our 2nd visit this year to The a Milestone. The romantic turndown was very special with champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries. Thanks to all the staff at this wonderful hotel for yet again making our stay so lovely.
May 2014,Traditional hotel in Kensington,"We stayed here for one night at the end of a London/Paris trip before we flew out of Heathrow the next day.  My husband and I are 30 and I wanted to splurge on the last night of our trip.  This is a traditional, mature hotel that I would probably recommend for an older crowd.  Upon our arrival, we booked afternoon tea for that afternoon, which we loved.  The food was delicious, especially the scones, and we had a great time.  That evening we walked through Kensington Gardens, right across the street.  The staff was great and we arranged for coffee in our room with the wake-up call early the next morning.  They also helped us figure out the most economical way to get to the aiport since we did not want to take a private car (we love quality public transportation).  The only…"
June 2014,Fox News and Really Fast Easy WIFI!,"We arrived a bit early on Sunday but the room was ready. We were offered a tour of the facilities and learned all we needed to know. It really is like being in someone's home.    #202 King was a good room on the back side, so quiet.   After freshening up a bit we went down to the Stables Bar to have our complimentary drink. Listen all you dopes, obviously we paid 510 per night and a free drink doesn't matter, but it does. It started a really valuable relationship with the lads at the bar. I'm horrible at names, they were from Italy. They listened to what we liked and made some amazing suggestions. We arrived one day when the lads weren't there and the other bartender knew our names and what  we wanted. Order the mixed sandwiches, really good. And they have Twiglets for bar…"
June 2014,Gorgeous hotel with lots of old English charm,"I have just returned from a mini break to London for my 30th birthday. My husband chose the Milestone as a surprise and he couldn't have picked a nicer place. The staff were lovely and very accommodating I stupidly forgotten a brush for example rang down and they found me one within minutes. Our room was a safari suite and it had great decor, the bed was extremely comfortable. The room was all very clean and we had a lovely view over the gardens I think the only thing people may struggle with is the shower height as fairly low but there is large bath and hose type shower to use.... This wasn't actually an issue for us at all, but thought may help other specify rooms etc.... The afternoon tea was delicious it is fairly expensive but you do get a fair amount of food and…"
June 2014,"Ok hotel, but dont understand its over the top rating","Nice hotel, but a hotel like many others. Small, ""dusty"" rooms, old facilities (bathroom, TV, AC, etc), old (and again ""dusty"") furniture, old windows with bad isolation - i.e.  a typical London, Paris or Rome hotel that attempts to create an ""old Europe"" feel but is simply just old and stuffy.  Service and food are good, but not excellent. There are many comparable hotels in London and I really really dont understand how so many excellent reviews and so few average ones came about. Just because there is a welcome drink? There is really nothing super special about this place - as I said, its good, but definitely not in the top 10 in Lindon. Just the location and the look of the hotel from the outside (esp. during xmas) are really great - but even that has a drawback since the…"
April 2014,Wonderful and Magnificent,"We've just enjoyed a long weekend in London, the highlight of which was our stay at The Milestone Hotel.  It is impossible to criticise or find fault with anything. The staff are warm, welcoming, attentive, friendly - in short, they turn an outstanding hotel into a truly great hotel. The recruitment and training must be extremely fastidious to achieve such brilliant end results.  In future, it will be our home from home when visiting London.  We cannot recommend The Milestone too highly, nobody will be disappointed by their stay.  Theresa Hale and Peter Gamble"
March 2014,The feeling of home,"I recently stayed at The Milestone in London and it is fantastic.  Warm, friendly staff, great rooms and super Afternoon Tea.  I highly recommend this property.  Check out their breakfast fruits in herb and spice syrups.  I'm going to try it at home. All of Red Carnation hotels are great and I consider this one the Star in their Crown in London."
March 2014,The Milestone is more than a place to stay.,"As good as The Milestone Hotel is as a place to stay it's real value is found in the staff.  Of course, the rooms are wonderful, the service outstanding and the location superb, but what really makes the hotel truly five star is the quality and character of the entire staff.  From the night turn down help to the people working the front desk and everyone else who works at The Milestone, the attitude is one of friendliness and concern.  There is always a smile on everyone's face and an overarching concern for the guest's well being.  It's more than good training that is being exhibited.  It is a genuine desire to make a guest's stay at The Milestone truly memorable.  Over the years my wife and I have been coming to The milestone I have come to know many of the people who make up…"
April 2014,Amazing,"This is a top notch hotel, all the staff and very friendly and helpful. There is no snootiness at all. Not a very big hotel but quality through and through.The breakfast was excellent and the afternoon tea first class. We only stayed one night after attending a concert at the Albert Hall (5 mins walk) but we will be back for sure."
March 2014,"One of the best in ""The Leading Hotels of the World""","We just returned from a month in Europe. We stayed at the Milestone for 3 nights. This was our second visit to this fabulous hotel. Everything was just as wonderful as it was the first time. The entire staff was very cordial, knowledgeable and helpful. We had breakfast every morning in the restaurant and dinner there on our last evening. The food is delicious and such good choices. We've stayed in many of the""Leading Hotels of the World"" all over Europe and The Milestone is at the top of our list! The rooms are tastefully decorated and the beds are the most comfortable ever! Love those linens! The location is great--close to a tube station and across from Kensington Gardens and Palace. The staff is very detailed oriented and committed to lending assistance in any situation. They…"
April 2014,surprise weekend away,"This was a surprise organised by my husband as part of my Christmas present. From the moment we arrived to the very moment we walked out of the door it was an amazing experience. The Hotel and it's staff are wonderful. Nothing is too much trouble and I felt we were treated like royalty. The personal touches were out of this world. The view from the hotel is amazing- Kensington Palace and grounds. What better view could you want. Even though it is part of a group of hotels, Red Carnation, it was very personal. The food is well cooked and plentiful and always served to a very high standard. Staff are on hand at all times to offer help and support from booking taxis to telling you about the hotel itself. My husband looked at some of the more expensive hotels in London but this is…"
April 2014,An oasis in a bustling city,"Having just spent four nights at the Milestone to end off a five week European adventure I could not let our stay go without posting my praises for this wonderful hotel.  Everything was exceptional. The food was terrific, we loved the afternoon tea particularly, we were eating leftovers for days. The attention to detail in the hotel is outstanding, there is not one thing I could think of that the hotel hadn't already taken care of. The staff were always courteous and friendly and very welcoming of our young son.   We were treated to birthday cakes, gifts and evening canapés. We felt very special indeed.   Having visited London in the past we know what a gem this hotel is. The location is great, short walks to buses, the Tube, shops, restaurants and of course Kensington Gardens.…"
March 2014,WOW!!! What a treat.,"We were treated to a stay here from our family a few weeks back and wow what a treat that was. Rooms was amazing, adored the location. Fantastic hotel :) I advised everyone to give this hotel a stay, will not be disappointed."
April 2014,A Home away from Home,"Our first trip to London was about 5 years ago. We told our travel agent that we wanted a lovely boutique hotel and she immediately suggested The Milestone Hotel. It was then, as it is now, a truly wonderful experience. The hotel itself is beautifully decorated and appointed. The staff is amazing as  we were made to feel very special. The breakfast is served in a lovely dining room, and high tea can be had in the parlor near the fireplace.Each room is lovely and different. This time we stayed in one of the apartments. It was amazing and everyone was most comfortable. The concierge was great in their selection of restaurants and theater. Kensington Palace is directly across the street as is a nice park for walking or running. The Milestone is truly a ""luxurious home away from…"
April 2014,Pushing the Boat out,"It was our 20th wedding anniversary, so if an excuse to ‘push the boat out’ was needed, this was it.  The Milestone is part of the Red Carnation Group, and we have experienced some of their other London hotels over the years.  A New Year party at the Rubens, and several visits to Hotel 41 in recent years; all enjoyable to some degree and we would go again.   The Milestone is at the end of Kensington High Street, where it becomes Kensington road.  It’s a short walk from the tube or a £20 taxi fare from main train stations.  It’s a busy and at times noisy road, but very convenient for the park and other central locations (museums, Albert Hall etc.). We were greeted at the door by a ‘Traditional Doorman’, rather like many large luxury hotels and ushered inside to the pretty…"
April 2014,Best of the best,"We are first time travelers to Europe, so when we decided to ""go for it"" we consulted, friends, travel experts, and tripadvisor for every city. From Hotel de Russie in Rome to Villa De Este in Lake Como, we stayed at extremely expensive highly rated hotels every step of the way.. and London was somewhat of a last pit stop on our way back to the states. My husband chose the hotel based on tripadvisor reviews. Burnt out from rude Parisians at the Mandarin Oriental in Paris, and tired from a four city trip to Italy, we arrived to the cheeriest, most professional, detailed, comfortable place and people we had yet to experience. I WISH we had spent more time here and less time in Paris. I love, love love this hotel, the staff, the attention to detail, the care they give.. and I am so…"
April 2014,No other place will do,"I enjoyed every second in this luxury hotel. Having never been to England before, it was really a first hand experience I will never forget. The weather was also doing it's best to shine. I felt very lucky to be there at that time. Such enjoyment I will come back and stay here every time I come to England."
March 2014,We love the Milestone,"My mom and I spent 4 nights at the Milestone last month. What we have experienced at this hotel was what ""customer service"" is all about. Every single staff gave a genuine smile and treated us as if we were their only customer. We love that the hotel was not too big and all the staff are attentive and caring. Breakfast was perfect and the afternoon tea with champagne was fabulous. The porter Abdi was very friendly and helpful. On our last day we asked where our favorite cookie shop was located and he went out to buy for us while we relaxed at the lobby. The concierge could fulfill all our requests..from booking the best seats at the theatre to recommending places to visit. There was a personal touch in every details. We would  recommend the Milestone to all our friends and will…"
March 2014,Good stay,"I stayed here with my husband in March 2014, because of the good recommendations here on Trip Advisor. The hotel has a great location, it is easy and convenient to get around, and we had nice long walks in the park and in the area. The hotel has a great service, but sometimes it felt a little too much. For instance, we said no thanks to a few of the offers from the staff, but they did not listen - just insisted, because it ""said so on the sheet"". At breakfast four different people stopped by to check if everything was ok...in just a few minutes. To us it felt a little intimidating. We had booked a room with a view, but was asked if we wanted a bigger room. A nice offer, but with no view we regretted the move. To us, the best thing was the turndown service, I just love it when…"
March 2014,Lovely stay at the Milestone,My husband and I just spent four nights at The Milestone during our first stay in London. From the moment of our arrival until departure our every need was met. All of the staff was pleasant and attentive. We ate breakfast in the hotel every morning and had tea one afternoon. Excellent service and food. We were able to easily navigate the city each day on the advice of Jose and James. They were so helpful checking our daily plan and offering tips. They helped us choose restaurants each evening and secured reservations for us. We enjoyed dinner at everyone of their recommendations. If we travel to London again we would defiantly stay at The Milestone!
March 2014,Wow! Impressed. A wonderful hotel.,"After having stayed in hundreds of hotels across the world the Milestone is in now firmly in my top 10. Could you do better in terms of trendy glamour? Sure, but this hotel goes the extra mile in terms of unbelievable customer service.  This well located (steps from High Street Kensington) hotel is intimate, rooms comfy, the bed sheets are magnificent and big, bright bathrooms all make this a great stay but it's the staff that put the Milestone into a different stratosphere.   From the moment you walk through the door you feel at home, happy and welcomed. The gift of home made biscuits and tea from the chef is accompanied with a hand written note from the exec chef, there was a card from management and then there's the fact everyone knows your name all combine into a lovely…"
March 2014,# One in Our Hearts,"Checking in to the number one rated hotel in London surpassed all our expectations. The Milestone sets the standard for premier service and amenities.  From the moment we arrived to the time we checked out we were 'spoiled rotten' as promised by the very helpful reservationist. From Steve the doorman, to Pedro the butler, to Jose and Joshua, concierges extraordinaire, our every need was attended to with enthusiasm.  Every staff member in the hotel works as a team member to serve the guest.  The restaurant staff, the bartenders, the bellman are all constantly on the ready to help accommodate any guest at any time.  High Tea at the Milestone was elegant and delicious as well as the breakfast served each morning.  It was hard to leave this hotel and re-enter the real world.  We…"
February 2014,High expectations - exceeded!,My wife and I recently had a trip to London and I had a tough time choosing a good hotel …. I  choose The Milestone for a few reasons but primarily based on the reviews on TripAdvisor - the reviews are excellent - I am generally quite cynical about reviews and thought it can't be that good - what can they do that make a hotel experience so special? -  well they can and the do - remarkable service - from each and everyone of the staff -  Well done The Milestone - Many hotels could learn a lot from yours!  not cheap but very very good ..
March 2014,Afternoon Tea with champagne at the milestone.,"I came to know about this hotel as i was looking for a place that has the feel of traditional afternoon tea in London. What a surprise this hotel was and what a revelation. The service starts from the doorman to the concierge to the maitre de of the parlor to the waiter who assisted us through all the tea sipping, finger sandwiching, bite sized desserts we can stuff our mouths with. I also can't forget to mention this was all followed by the flakiest scones with local jam and clotted cream you can eat. That is if you can after eating all the abundant first tidbits they provide you with. At the milestone you feel like you stepped into a bygone era where the tea room feels like your aunts parlor, that is if your aunt was a noble lady and you were in the 19th century. It was cozy…"
March 2014,Wonderful stay!,"Everything about our stay was perfect - the room, the service by all members of staff and the food and drink both in the Stables Bar as well as breakfast in the restaurant. My husband had arranged a romantic turn down while we were at the theatre and it was beautifully done. Thank you to everyone at The Milestone for making our first stay so special, we will be returning!!"
June 2014,Perfect Hotel,This is a perfect hotel with  a very convenient and central location. This hotel deserves to be  the  recipient of a  Travelers Choice. Award. It is such a charming hotel with an exceptional staff.  The service was extraordinary.The room was very nice and comfortable. I look forward to our next visit.
June 2014,An amazing experience,"An amazing experience:  Upgraded free of charge. Fresh fruit in the room Luxury Sheets and Towels Complimentary Champagne, and Bottled Water, and soaps etc Fresh Flowers throughout the hotel. Room cleaned twice a day, even picking our clothes up and putting them on the hangers. Gorgeous Breakfast, with an amazing choice. Room peaceful, and fully air conditioned Gorgeous Shower Turndown service a must have Order Tea or coffee to the room, and get fabulous free biscuits with it (and a flower) Nothing to much trouble Want to know the best places to eat ask desk staff, wonderful local knowledge, want a taxi just ask, want an umbrella just ask, in fact anything we wanted we could have. Staff remembered our names from first time. To much more to list, but in summary if you want to be…"
June 2014,Perfect hotel for daughters's graduation gift!!,"Two weeks ago, my husband and I took our two daughters to London for their high school/college graduations.  We were simply overjoyed with our stay at The Milestone.  Their service is impeccable!  The breakfast was loaded with many goodies, more than ever needed.  The rooms, both deluxe and junior suites were superior.  The girls' room was absolutely adorable and perfect for them in a powder blue velvet with double twin canopies!  A surprise birthday cake was even delivered for one daughter's birthday!  Candles were lit in the evening in the master bath when we returned at night.  The observatory was one of our favorites stops for a drink or respite.  Both bartenders knew our special drinks and always had them ready.  Immaculada, our waitress for breakfast was  perfect!  Other…"
April 2014,convenient location,the bus stop in front of the hotel is very convenient.  the concierge is helpful. i suggest you contact them in advance for questions. the room is very clean and has nice amenities.  the afternoon tea was disappointing.  i thought it was expensive and not worth it.
June 2014,The best hotel in London without a doubt!,"If you are reading this review and  wondering whether to stay at The Milestone or another hotel in London then stop looking! STAY AT THE MILESTONE! Forget the Savoy and the Ritz, they will not give you the amazing customer service and attention to detail you'd get at the Milestone.   My family and I have just had the most incredible experience at a hotel EVER! I book to stay one night to celebrate my husbands 50th birthday, but I wish we could have stayed longer.   Let's start at the beginning. Firstly we arrive about noon even though I knew our room wasn't going to be ready until 2pm but I had been assured we could drop our luggage off. On arrival we were greeted by the mist charming young lady who apologised and said our room wasn't ready but would be like to have a…"
June 2014,"The height of elegance, luxury and hospitality","We've just returned home from our fifth stay at London's finest and friendliest, five star Hotel, The Milestone, in Kensington. Having discovered this gem of an accommodation in June last year, my Wife, myself and our little Dog have returned repeatedly as and when we have and business or pleasure trips in the capital. Upon arrival at the Milestone you are treated so very special with friendly, helpful, smiling staff offering the warmest reception possible. Our rooms are always clean and spacious, extremely quiet and comfortable ensuring the best nights sleep possible. The breakfast is amazing with a wide choice of cereal, fruit, cold meats, cheeses, bread, yoghurts and of course probably the finest cooked breakfast you could ever wish for, prepared exactly as you wish. We…"
June 2014,Every possible box was ticked!,"Our stay at The Milestone was a surprise organised by my husband to celebrate my birthday. What a perfect choice he made! From the moment our taxi stopped outside the hotel, everything was absolutely perfect. The Concierge, the staff at Reception, the gentleman who gave us a little tour of the hotel, the beautiful room, the elegant High Tea, the first class dinner,  the service.....Suffice to say, the attention to detail in every part of our stay was outstanding.  We are fortunate to have spent time in some of the hotels in Europe and Asia often considered to be the best and, yes, they were lovely but The Milestone had a certain something extra to offer - something which left us completely unable to think of anything they could have done better.  We couldn't even make that…"
June 2014,Afternoon Tea is a lovely treat,"Forget the usual tourist choices in London for afternoon tea  The Milestone is a beautiful place to go for excellent service, a nice range teas and substantial amounts of sandwiches, scones and pastries. All this served in a traditional drawing room or the conservatory. Highly recommend "
May 2014,"Good, not so good and indifferent","Briefly the good parts: lovely staff, good location, good breakfast and wonderful dinner . The not so good: some traffic noise from Kensington High Street, expensive, preference form is more or less ignored, rooms not sound proof enough, a little cramped for space.  In detail. The good; wonderful staff, good food, great cocktails, convenient valet parking, good location near to Kensington Palace. Cosy atmosphere.  The indifferent: confused communications - three times we were given complementary items as an apology for small issues, each time we were either charged for them until I pointed this out, or we did not get the complementary service. Pointless preference form (until they follow it up properly).  I booked this hotel based on fantastic recommendations and rating.  I had…"
May 2014,Not special,"We changed from The Montague to The Milestone Hotel because the suite was in the basement. We followed the offer from the Management of The Montague. They showed us an impressive picture and my husband said: ""Oh, that should be one of the best in London."" He read it at ""trip advisor"". So we took it. Yes we had more space and yes we had a window, but we've got an very old ""smelling"" suite. The bathroom was tiny and the stuff - accept two - were not that friendly. But we wanted to enjoy our stay, so we made the best of it. The price for a ""tiny"" steak was incredible and the steak itself was not that great. I think it's very hard to impress us, because we are living in a country with an high restaurant standard. The next time we'll take our first choice in London - The Wellesley.…"
March 2014,One of the best small hotels in the world.,"The service is impeccable, the food and the presentation is excellent, the concierge service is wonderful. the location is supreme.  Without a doubt one of the best small hotels where I have stayed. Special mention to be made to the concierge, the tea service in the afternoon, the small intimate bar."
March 2014,This must be what it's like to stay at Buckingham Palace,"This is my first TripAdvisor review. I'm excited to share my experience from these past few days at The Milestone Hotel! I've traveled to London over a dozen times from the U.S. In the past I've always opted for the ""big name"" 5 star London hotels. I was excited to try something new this trip based on the advice of a friend and the terrific online reviews. This is a family run, small hotel that is part of the Red Carnation Collection, founded by Bea Tollman who was awarded best hotelier several years ago. The family feel is what makes the big difference. Everyone cares and it's totally genuine in and out. You can't train to this level of service if it's not genuine and at the Milestone it really is. This hotel is like Apple is to computer stores. Every detail has been thought…"
February 2014,Treated like Royalty,"To sum it up I felt like the Great Gatsby during our stay at the Milestone.  The Carnation Hotels in London are second to none.  The owners and management have found a special recipe for success in how the staff are consistently top notch and the food and accommodations beyond 5 stars!  We were pleasantly surprised when we first arrived to be upgraded to the Prince Albert room.  This room was jaw dropping in terms of its size, interior design, functionality, and ambience...pictures do not do it justice.  In fact it was hard to pull ourselves away from the room during the day to go sightseeing.  The dining room and lounges were incredibly cozy and the food and drinks were outstanding.  The staff were extremely engaged, and professional.  Everyone new our names from the minute we…"
February 2014,Afternoon Tea,"After coming here for afternoon tea on our anniversary I need to adjust all my previous ratings on Tripadvisor. The luxuriousness of the Park Lounge and reception is beyond what I could have imagined. The service is unbelievable, there is always someone nearby to ask. We went for the classic afternoon tea option which came with more than enough food for us: sandwiches, a selection of cakes etc. and freshly cooked scones. If you don't finish it don't worry they will pack it up in a box for you to take with you. One tip I would give would be If you use Foursquare you can get a glass of champagne free with each check in at the moment saving you about £9 (simple afternoon tea vs. champagne afternoon tea)."
December 2013,Magical and forever special,"We stayed in the rooftops apartment for 10 days just after Christmas and it was so lovely it's hard to explain.All the amenities you can possibly imagine (room service,housekeeping etc) but it also felt like you were living in London with your own apartment. Staff is discreet, housekeeping staff are outstanding..I have stayed in luxury hotels in many cities in the world and have never had more congenial,welcoming staff anywhere! The breakfast is fantastic but if you have a chance they had the most fantastic warm salted caramel sauce on the rice pudding that was to die for ( am considering emailing the hotel for the recipe) .Wonderful location across from Kensington Palace,easy access to tube or buses and easy to hail a cab from wonderful doorman....without a doubt I recommend…"
February 2014,Excellent Afternoon Tea,"Visited on Sunday afternoon for a 70th birthday. Wonderful experience all round. Food was fresh, plentiful and good quality. Wide range of teas. Nice small intimate room with great ambience. Staff were all friendly and attentive without being over the top. Nice cocktails in the bar which was also very atmospheric. All in all a perfect afternoon."
February 2014,Lovely Hotel,"Service was spectacular...went out of their way to handle a special request, actually went out and got us a newspaper they didn't have.  Afternoon tea is simply divine...not to be missed.  Got there really early and they served us coffee and cookies while we waited but the room was finished so they brought it up there!"
February 2014,Great London Hotel!,"My daughter and I stayed at the Milestone for 5 days as we traveled in Europe.  It was a top notch hotel in every aspect.  From the doorman to the bellhop - all staff made our stay very pleasant.  When we first arrived we checked in and then we were offered a tour of the hotel and all the facilities.  No other hotel has ever done that. We were greeted personally every time by all the staff. Our room was perfect with a nice sitting area and desk and bathroom on the lower level.  Weather was a bit rainy and chilly some days so we took advantage of watching the Olympics hanging out in the room.  It was off the beaten path a little bit, but moving through the city is pretty easy.  We did a lot of walking and it was nice to see so many people enjoying Kensington Park with their…"
February 2014,First class,"Luxurious, quintessentially English hotel with first class, friendly service. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.Very comfortable bed with luxurious pillows. Delicious breakfast, (something we are very particular about as B&B owners!), perfectly cooked eggs and the best sausages. We also dined at Chenestons, a beautiful traditional restaurant setting; the prawn and crayfish cocktail was the most packed full of prawns I've ever seen! Wouldn't hesitate to recommend and I hope that we'll be back! Thank you."
February 2014,Afternoon tea,"If you want to have the best afternoon tea experience, there is only one place The Milestone Hotel!! Incredible service from staff, Fabrizio Russo with his little touches here and there makes it even more memorable.! A place you must visit in your lifetime."
February 2014,A jewel of a hotel,"This is the first time at a luxury 5 star hotel and being my first I had to get it right and I can safely say I have done that after detailed research. The Milestone is a fantastic hotel to stay at, I guess what set's this hotel apart from others is it's multiple teamed colourful rooms with adds true character (pictures on websites don't do any justice). The staff are very friendly and will cater to your every needs. Overall I will be back to The Milestone again."
December 2013,Historical and most elegant,"This has to be the most elegant hotel i had stayed in,we stayed as couple and everything was top notch,the best thing about the hotel is their service which exceeded my expectations,elegant rooms with superb bathrooms and one of the best bed i had ever slept on."
July 2013,Perfection,I took my parents here for dinner and spent the night in absolute luxury. Every little detail is attended to and you are made to feel so incredibly special. Fabulous hotel and wonderful spa treatments. The food was out of this world and located just opposite Kensington gardens was great to walk off the carbs. Staff are so attentive i don't wish to stay anywhere ever again as it will never match up to this wonderful hotel.
November 2013,our home away from home,"It is such a wonderful experience to return over and over again to the Milestone Hotel. Everything, from the accommodations, the staff, the decor, is first rate.The Milestone is the only place we stay in London. We have been there many times. It is wonderful to see the same managers, concierges and loyal staff who have been there for a long time. The location of the hotel could not be better. Service great. We cannot say enough wonderful things about this special hotel."
February 2014,Perfection,"We have stayed in some wonderful hotels around the world and this has to be one of the highest rated. Best described as a boutique hotel offering impeccable service in high quality surroundings. The rooms are beautifully presented with everything a guest could ever possibly need. The bed is extremely comfortable and the bed linen is exquisite. The furnishings throughout the entire hotel are elegant and sophisticated.  It was our anniversary whilst we were staying and the staff went to considerable trouble to decorate our room with petals, night lights and treats such as chocolate dipped strawberries. We were offered champagne on arrival after a very swift, efficient check in. All the staff called us by name and nothing was too much trouble.   We were asked by a member of staff…"
January 2014,Hotel Heaven,"My wife and I spent two days at this historic hotel.  It was absolutely fantastic!  Our room was on two levels, with a view of Kensington Park.  We were greeted at the curb by a doorman in formal attire.  When our luggage was delivered, the attendant asked if we cared for Champaign (complementary).  The room had two wardrobes, fresh flowers, fresh fruit, candy, two TV monitors, a dining table, a sitting area, two sets of bathrobes (light and heavy), slippers, and a Bose entertainment system.  Their motto is ""No request too large, no detail too small"".  Every aspect of this hotel (decorations, artwork, furnishings, food, and especially service) is outstanding."
February 2014,"The Majestic, Magnificent Milestone","The Milestone Hotel is guaranteed to offer a truly wonderful home from home Hotel experience. The welcome received from everyone is absolutely incredible. The many personal touches, including those for our little dog, were so meaningful and goes to show that everyone at London's number one premier Hotel, really does care about their guests, be they two or four legged. The Hotel General Manager took time to hand write a personal welcoming letter, which meant so much. Our room was immaculate, inviting and extremely comfortable, everything we could have asked for, which resulted in a most restful and peaceful nights sleep. Dining is superb, offering an extensive menu, prepared and served beautifully. All the staff members excelled by nature of their individual warmth, kindness and…"
September 2013,The Milestone Hotel,"The Milestone is the epitome of luxury when staying in London. In fact, it is the favorite place to stay in the entire world for my husband and me, and we have stayed in many fine hotels! The rooms are elegantly furnished; the service is beyond excellent; and the location is lovely. I cannot praise the hotel and service enough.   Jean Matz Florida, USA"
August 2013,Great location,"Stayed for 4 nights in August 2013. Great location near Kensington Palace. Walking distance to many sights, shopping and restaurants. Breakfast is delicious and many options are available. The staff in the breakfast dining room remembered our preferences after the first day. Internet service can be inconsistent, if you are planning to do some work. Overall a lovely place to enjoy a visit to London!"
January 2014,what a fantastic birthday,The best ever experience of staying in a hotel.  I had told the team that it was my birthday when I booked and filled in the pre stay preferences.  On arriving I had been triple upgraded to one of the master suites and there was a birthday cake and card awaiting plus the champagne and flowers i had booked with their get more from your stay deal.  The staff couldn't have been more helpful and the suite was beautiful.  From the Penhaligon Toiletries to the canapes delivered to our room each evening the little touches were lovely. The Breakfasts were beautifully cooked and my request for eggs florentine not a problem We stayed for afternoon tea with my niece and they were just as happy to provide soy milk for her. The cakes and scones were plentiful and necessitated a take away…
November 2013,A Mini Downton Abbey,"You will feel like you are visiting the Crawley family's London home when you stay here. The staff is lovely, the decor is Edwardian fantasy, the location--across from Kensington Palace-- is terrific."
January 2014,Amazing London Trip,"We had high expectations and they were still surpassed!! So thankful for staff who treated us so kindly. You must have High Tea here. We will always stay here, no other hotel will be able to live up the The Milestone."
December 2013,Christmas present for Mum,I booked afternoon tea at the Milestone as it was near The Albert Hall which we had been to before the tea.It is a short walk from the RAH with Kensington gardens along the route.  The moment we arrived to the moment we left we were made to feel so very special and as this was a treat for my Mum I could not be happier.  The tea was delicious and the service second to none I look forward to my next visit because I will be going again.
December 2013,Simply fantastic,We had the pleasure of spending the New year at the Milestone Hotel and it was amazing. From the minute we pulled up in our cars the staff were terrific; especially with our daughter and our Chocolate Labrador who were treated like VIPs throughout our stay. Our suites were splendid and beautifully decorated with lovely views of Hyde Park and there were treats and pressies for everyone even our dog. The meals were exceptional and afternoon tea a must. You take tea in the cosy lounge which is very relaxing and scrumptious. Nothing was to much trouble and the staff were so polite and helpful. They even bought up some popcorn for my daughter as they knew she was watching an afternoon film :-) . The turn back service in the evening was very thoughtful and a lovely touch. If you are…
December 2013,Beyond Excellent,"I doubt any hotel will ever live up to The Milestone!  From accommodating late night cravings, to the most wonderful Honeycomb Ice Cream, the staff was consistently attentive to our needs. I would never stay anywhere else when in London."
December 2013,Perfect stay!,"We loved the Milestone Hotel, amazing location, the staff were so friendly and personable usually I don't like hotel staff because they are a bit stuffy, but these guys had the perfect blend of personality and professionalism.  The hotel itself is amazing, every room is different and our was gorgeous.  Afternoon tea was brilliant, the pool was great as was the sauna.  There is nothing I can suggest to improve it!"
December 2013,""" A gem of a hotel""","We recently spent a weekend at the Milestone Hotel during the Christmas holiday. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this charming hotel. The staff and service was first rate and the concierge exceptional. The cozy bar was perfect location for before or after dinner drinks and high tea in the drawing room was a truly British experience. Don't miss the chicken pot pie, it is fabulous and real comfort food! We can't wait to return!"
December 2013,Impressive Service,"We enjoyed impressive service from all staff members, including the reception, restaurant, bar and housekkeepping staff.   All member of the staff adhere to high standards and are very attentive to detail. We were especially impressed with the connectivity of the different staff departments - they all seem to work together seamlessly to make our stay was very memorable."
December 2013,Our Favorite Hotel in London,"We stayed at this hotel years ago and returned as happy satisfied guests, once again.  The hotel staff are so friendly and welcoming.  We enjoyed the High Tea with Champagne and it was such a wonderful experience.  We have friends there who also attended the High Tea and they were impressed with the entire experience, as local Brits!  The rooms are beautiful and decorated so nicely.  The restaurant and meals were exceptional, as well.  We enjoyed all of our meals (room service and in the restaurant) and our time spent in the quaint bar located in the hotel.  If you have an opportunity to stay at this hotel, you should absolutely not think twice about it; you won't be disappointed in any way.  The Bonus is the location, which is directly across the street from Kensington Palace. …"
January 2014,Can't be beaten,"We stayed here on a round world trip where we also stayed at leading properties like the Plaza New York and the Westin St Francis in SFO. The facilities at the Milestone are on par (objectively a bit behind) but what puts the Milestone ahead is the way the staff treat you an connect with you as individuals. Even on the rare occasions where service slips up they recover so quickly with an extra glass of champagne, etc Literally our favourite hotel in the world!"
June 2013,Unrivalled service,"The Milestone hotel has to be noted as one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in in the UK, and we have stayed in some of the countries finest.  The service has been unbelievably good and the room, sumptuous with the most amazing attention to detail. Well located with lovely views. A truly  memorable stay, thank you,  and absolutely no hesitation in recommending to others. We look forward to our next visit."
November 2013,The Best,Everything about our experience at The Milestone was excellent. The service was courteous and the facility was immaculate. We spent a lot of time in the conservatory and found it to be very comfortable and memorable. The location is excellent. 
July 2013,So much fun at the Milestone,"I guess one should able to take is as given, in a luxury hotel, that the staff will genuinely see it as their job to keep the guests happy: it's only when you visit somewhere like the Milestone that you realise how rare this is. We stayed here for a couple of nights on a big birthday and it felt as though all the staff were just waiting to make it special: their welcome was genuine and charming, and we had the best combination of being indulged and feeling at home. Our room (Mistinguette/art deco) was great fun and, even in November, it was fabulous to have the little balcony to stroll out onto. Everything - the champagne on arrival, turndown with roses and candles, scrumptious smoked haddock breakfasts and supper-a-deux (thank you, Florent, for making this so welcoming) - all…"
December 2013,The Fiona Duncan Review,"The Milestone is a most wonderful hotel, I don't know where Fiona Duncan was coming from in her review. The staff and the hotel are brilliant. If you are a guest there you are made to feel very special. Where else would the doorman be waiting for you, after walking all round Hyde Park in your walking kit, with bottles of water. It may be expensive but the Milestone has the best service that I have ever experienced. And, for over thirty years I stayed in some of the best hotels in the Far East."
January 2014,Amazing Christmas weekend away,"I booked a room at The Milestone as a surprise for my partner the weekend before Christmas; and it's fair to say I wasn't disappointed. The staff were ever so friendly and helpful - and happy to go that extra mile!  I left our bags there, as we spent the day in London, which were in our room when we checked in later on. When we actually did arrive together, around 9pm, we still received a whole tour of the hotel - something that I didn't expect when arriving that late. The building, both inside and out, was gorgeous - lovely decor throughout, especially with the Christmas lights outside. The room itself was very spacious and luxurious, although we didn't have the greatest view, it's not something that impacted on our experience.  The champagne afternoon tea is extremely filling…"
December 2013,Excellent as always,This was our fourth visit to this very special hotel and again we had a wonderful stay. They pay attention to every little detail. If you want to be King and/or queen for a couple of days just go to the Milestone Hotel and you know what it feels like!
January 2014,Top Notch Service in a Superb Location,"My husband was about to celebrate a milestone birthday on Boxing Day, and London is one of our very favourite cities. We were therefore delighted that our research revealed The Milestone Hotel - a supremely rated boutique style hotel in a gorgeous Kensington location.  The Milestone is perhaps best known for its superbly warm service. From the moment our taxi arrived and we were greeted by an utterly charming doorman, we knew we had made the right choice. The facility itself is casually elegant, with an Edwardian ambience and unfailingly friendly staff that left you feeling you were staying in a private hotel early in the last century.  Our first floor, no view, room was predictably compact, though very nicely appointed, with an oversized bathroom that was a real bonus. We slept…"
January 2014,They go the extra mile at The Milestone!!,"Both myself and a colleague of mine have both stayed at The Milestone in the last couple of months and we have no qualms in saying that the Hotel provided for us both with one of the most glorious and impressive stays we have ever experienced.  If you are after luxury, stylish and spacious rooms, impeccable service, fabulous food and all the comforts in a convenient London location, this is the Hotel for you!  Breakfast in the room was most indulgent and all of the staff really know how to make you feel like a VIP.  They really do go the extra mile at The Milestone!!"
December 2013,Decadent luxury from an age gone by ... Worth everyone of its 5 stars and possibly much more ...,"Stayed here for my daughters birthday and everything was absolutely perfect. We knew we had truly come to stay somewhere very special from the moment we entered  this hotel. We were warmly greeted and then given a mini tour of the hotel. The hotel overlooks Hyde park and Kensington palace and is in a good location . Even though we had arrived very early, our room was ready and we  were promptly taken there . I felt like we had been taken back in time to an era of pure elegance and luxury, where service was second to none and every minute detail , had been thought through with great care. The room suppassed my expectations in every way . Beautifully decorated  and every bit 5 star . The hotel itself is wonderful, with  first class service from all the staff. Nothing is too much…"
December 2013,WONDERFUL STAY,"Our stay at the Milestone was pure luxury.Every part of the Hotel had been carefully considered to make the visit a wonderful experience. The Staff, décor and guest amenities were all top class We quickly felt at home!!! The candles and petals that greeted us at in our room at night created the perfect atmosphere as part of my wife's birthday celebrations"
December 2013,Bliss!,I took my girlfriend here for a romantic weekend and we were both stunned by the level of customer service; all the staff made us feel completely at home. The room was beautiful and the facilities were first class. Probably the best hotel I've ever stayed in! We had a truly wonderful weekend.
December 2013,Very personal approach but not cheap.,"The hotel building is very nice, cosy, English. Old furniture, rugs, old books, etc. Room was nice but very small for 3, made up several times a day. All staff members were extremely friendly, allways ready to be of assistance. Subway not far away.  The pool revealed very small, compared with what was seen on the pictures. The shower over there only had cold water. Breakfast was ok but sometimes we did wait quite some time to be served. (on 1 occasion almost 1 hour) We ate in the hotel restaurant on one occasion. The food was ok but not cheap. Overall, the rate we paid for our stay was also quite expensive. We've been in other 5* places with more infrastructure en more spacy rooms for less but than again it is a very nice place."
October 2013,Stay nowhere else !,My family and I spent 3 wonderful nights at this incredible hotel .  I have stayed in a lot of Leading Hotels of the World and this one is right up the top ! We were greeted by the wonderful staff ...thank you to all of you for making our stay a memorable one .  Unfortunately we will now have to find hotels that match the Milestone.  We will definitely be back :)
December 2013,Beautiful ,"A two night stay in the most beautiful hotel I've ever seen. Very vintage décor.  Our room was lilac, from the bed to the walls to the curtains but it was lovely. The staff were so friendly and welcoming. I wish we dined there but instead we had reservations elsewhere.   We did have afternoon tea in our room, very expensive for afternoon tea, the sandwiches were not the nicest, chicken and peanut... Not really the norm, but the cakes were delicious.   Hoping to stay again "
December 2013,"A fun-filled, beautiful stay","Our stay at The Milestone was by far the best hotel experience we've had in the many years that we've been visiting London.  We were in London to celebrate my husband's 40th birthday with four other couples, all of whom were completely impressed with the comfort of the rooms, the perfect location, and (most of all) the unfailingly courteous staff.  Even after a few long days of attending raucous soccer matches and over-indulging in London Pride, the staff accommodated our noisy group with humor and generosity of spirit.  This is the only Hotel we will consider for future trips to London."
December 2013,Fantastic,"Andrew and I stayed at the hotel as returning guests as it is our romantic favourite treat, and it was Andrew's late birthday present.  We had an even more wonderful experience than last time, because they upgrade to a suite, Wow what a pleasure and privilege.  All the staff were wonderful, thank you so so much..."
December 2013,Best Hotel in London,"I have traveled and stayed at many 5 Star hotels but this one is by far the gest I have ever seen. In addition, to the being beautiful, the staff is beyond anything I have ever experienced. No matter what you need, they are there with a friendly smile. The attention to detail is remarkable. We even received stockings with gifts on Christmas!!"
December 2013,Amazing charming stay,"If there was a ten in the survey I would give the staff. Olivier the server, steve the doorman or Pablo the staff that showed us around. Just the best. We really enjoyed our stay. It was terrific. They remembered us by name asked about our day and were super friendly and helpful. Not just these three but the rest of the staff as well. These were just the cherry on top. Definitely will be back"
December 2013,Divine dining experience!,"If you want to feel special and pampered at one of the best hotels in the world then you have found the one! My amazing boyfriend decided to spoil me for my birthday recently and took me to this wonderful hotel as a surprise. I honestly didn't know where I was going until I arrived!  What a fantastic surprise it was! From the doorman who assisted us out the taxi to the lovely welcome from the concierge. The special cocktails in the very traditional bar and amazing bar snack selection kept my star rating climbing but what topped off my entire experience was the incredible food and superb service in Cheneston's restaurant. As they knew I was celebrating my birthday, they had reserved us a table in a beautiful private area with the sounds of the piano drifting through. A special…"
December 2013,Romantic amazing dinner,We dined at the Cheneston's (Kensington in old English as we learnt from the intro to the restaurant printed on the menu) gastronomic restaurant. The excellence of the service is remarkable as is the attention to detail in the surroundings as well as the food and drinks. The food was fabulous and the atmosphere even though luxurious is so cosy it is heart warming. We were overall enchanted!
June 2013,Great Hotel-but just missed the mark,"I was attracted to staying at this hotel. It's location and its fantastic rating on Trip Advisor clinched the decision. Fresh from staying at the Mandarin Oriental in Paris, it seemed the perfect choice, living up to its high status on Trip Advisor. The hotel was extensively renovated and modernized internally after a severe fire caused extensive damage more than 10 years ago. The service staff from the receptionist to the doormen to the concierge were fabulous. Rooms were small but given much thought in their layout to maximize functionality. Bathrooms were spacious but a little cold and the shower layout could have been better as the spray volume from the fixed overhead shower was inadequate to keep a person warm while showering. Bathroom heating, or better still, underfloor…"
June 2013,Best Hotel In London,"Me and my boyfriend came to London to visit some friends from Brighton, we did not intend to stay, after lunch we decided to go get a hotel and stay a night,  we randomly ended up in knightsbridge after driving around a bit and parked the car and walked into the nearest hotel which was the Milestone, upon arrival our bags were taken and the door was opened for us.   we asked for a room and as we had not booked we had to wait for a room to be made for us. during this time we were escorted into the most amazing bar, it was very cosy and had an equestrian theme! we were given nibbles and a glass of champagne on the house, (the best champagne I've ever had) our bags were taken to our room and then we went up.  The room was lovely! the deco was so homely, it was extremely clean! we…"
November 2013,The most perfect English hotel !,"Perfect, perfect rooms, entrance hall, the staff are so friendly yet not overbearing, upon a random arrival- we hadn't even booked we just drove up to the entrance we relieved of our bags and before you know it drinking a couple of glasses of Guy Cadel champagne - one of the best tasting house bottles I've had ! Had a great dinner also , would love to come back and visit !"
December 2013,"I could live here. No, really.","This was my fourth visit to the Milestone in 15 years. I wish I could visit several times a year, but I am not called to London often enough and my bank book cannot support my penchant for this sort of luxury. My most recent stay was in mid-November, and I admit I left feeling that I could live here. Not just in London, although that appeals, too, but no: I could easily live in the elegant cocoon of the Milestone where my every want and need are anticipated and filled.  From the moment you pull up in front of the hotel, you feel welcome. The staff are friendly but quietly understated. After the butler shows you to the room, tea is offered. How very civilized on a chilly London day!  Part of the Milestone's considerable charm is that it is just quirky enough to be authentic, and…"
December 2013,"Very cozy hotel, outstanding service","We're not usually big on boutique hotels but this one is exceptional. Service really sets them apart, and it is attentive and friendly from beginning to end. The decor is very traditionally British, but renovated and well-maintained throughout. We had been upgraded to a park view room, though the view was obscured by the lovely (from the outside) Christmas decorations. The staff is terrific, and addresses you by name very quickly. The food at Chennestons is wonderful, and there are a number of other restaurants easily accessible nearby.  If you're visiting London for the first time keep in mind that while the Milestone is convenient to Albert Hall, Kensington Gardens and Knightsbridge, it is not as walkable to the big sites in Westminster as the hotels in that Park Lane area.…"
November 2013,Quintessential English at its best,"We were lucky enough to have our wedding reception at the Milestone three years ago.  Last night we were even luckier to stay the night.  We had the Kensington Palace room, appropriately overlooking Kensington Gardens and onto the Palace.  The room was walled silk, thick damask type eiderdown, fluffy duvet, penhaglion toiletries, fruit and complimentary biscuits.  Knowing it was our wedding anniversary, they complemented all the above with congratulation cards, a bottle of champagne, strawberries dipped in chocolate and the final icing on the cake was returning to the room after dinner to find we had suddenly arrived in candle-land.  What seemed like hundreds of candles decorating the room, with equally hundreds of rose petals adorning the bed, and leading to the bathroom. …"
November 2013,Excellent Stay,"We stayed 3 nights (3 for the price of 2) for our wedding anniversary and we were luckily upgraded to a 2-bed apartment.  We splurged and arranged for the Bentley to collect us from the airport.  Enjoyed our welcome glass of bubbles in the saddle bar and then later in the evening had dinner at their signature restaurant. It is a charming quintessential British boutique hotel and the service is very good.  Great location for the Albert Hall, Knightsbridge and Hyde Park. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
December 2013,Lives up to the hype,"My wife and I stayed at The Milestone on the last weekend of November 2013 as a celebration for her birthday. I had read so many excellent reviews beforehand I had to wonder if The Milestone was really that good. In short, yes it is. The staff and their attention to detail are really what sets this place apart. Also special touches such as a complimentary glass of champagne each on arrival and balloons and a delicious birthday cake. The final crowning glory was the afternoon tea. As usual the service was impeccable and the food superb."
November 2013,our new 'home' when in london,"my 10 year old son and i just stayed two nights at the milestone (dec 2013).  what a great experience!  from the very beginning when i first emailed the hotel to our departure, the hotel was excellent.  I've stayed in many fine hotels around europe and the u.s., the milestone is amongst the very best.  they corresponded via email before our trip to ensure that both my son and i had the things we would need; helped us to find fun and enjoyable activities while at the hotel, and made sure we had a great room and all the wonderful service.    we enjoyed walking about london and taking the tube.  after all day sight seeing, we were rather tired so we had room service.  they have good food that even my picky eater son liked - chicken sticks, french fries, and ice cream.  speaking of…"
October 2013,A Wonderful Time,"My wife and I joined four other couples for a three nights stay at the Milestone. We arrived at 7:00am after a cross atlantic flight to find that our room was ready; no issues with an early check in or anything like that. We had breakfast at the hotel on two occaisions and had cocktails at the Stable bar. The hotel is located just a few minutes from the Kensington High Street Tube Stop and close to many of the more popular sites in London. Everyone at the hotel was always available to answer questions and help when needed. If I had one (small) complaint, I would say that the showers are very small and don't make it easy for a 6'2 man to comfortably shower.  If and when we come back to London, we will stay at this hotel.  It really was a wonderful experience and a first class…"
October 2013,Beautiful Luxury,"Located opposite Kensington Palace, the Milestone Hotel harkens back to a more luxurious and genteel time. The service was outstanding, even to the point where the hotel arranged for a birthday cake to be delivered to a restaurant across town. The decor is calm, country house and the rooms well appointed. Its location on Kensington High Street is excellent for public transport and is a short cab ride to Paddington Station for anyone taking the Heathrow Express."
November 2013,Difficult to fault,"For years we've struggled to find a hotel we'd recommend to people visiting London but this is it.  Charming and genuinely friendly service, layout with real character and a great location make this hotel outstanding. This was as close to perfect as you could expect. The staff went out of their way to be really helpful and solved a logistics problem with flair and initiative - and a large smile.  "
October 2013,One of the best small luxury hotels in the World,"Three weeks ago we were staying at Raffles Hotel in Singapore, yesterday we were at The Milestone! We have been so fortunate to stay in 2 of the best small luxury hotels in the World. They compare so well. The staff are fantastic. Well trained, keen, willing to go the extra mile/km and very personable.  We were shown to our room after a short tour of the hotel's amenities including the spa and small pool in the basement. Room 409, a Deluxe King overlooking Kensington Park, was a good size with 2 chairs and a desk and was beautifully appointed. The walls were lined with padded wallpaper!. The bathroom had a rainfall shower and was also a good size and beautifully decorated. As we settled in we were offered a complimentary glass of bubbly together with a small chocolate cake for…"
October 2013,Excellent in every sense,I've been in a lot of hotels but I must say this was the BEST.  The service is excellent and all the employees are very helpful and pleasant.  They responded to every request of ours.  I'll certainly stay here again and would recommend it highly to others.
October 2013,Wonderful hotel in Kensington,"The Milestone is a wonderful hotel nicely situated in Kensington. Outstanding staff and service and a small but excellent restaurant. By U.S. standards, our room was small but it was very comfortable and nicely furnished. Above all, it was quiet and conducive to a good night's sleep."
October 2013,Best hotel ever!,"Stayed here 2 nights. The room was very spacious, spotlessly clean, well decorated. I loved the hotel at the beginning and did enjoy every minute as staying here. The staff was super friendly, helpful and attentive. They pointed out and guided us to fantastic tourist destinations. Couldn't ask them for more. Definitely stay here in the short distance future for our next planned trip to Britain.  Highly recommend to stay here!"
October 2013,"Great, but not as good as the Egerton House","We've stayed at the Egerton house hotel which is also a red carnation hotel. We thought this time we would try the milestone. All started well and our welcome was good, although it just felt a little less organised than the Egerton. Our room was nice ( jungle room) and had some outside space which was very nice, although it seemed a little tired. The gold fittings in the bathroom were very worn and everything seemed a bit old. I think the room needs a bit of a makeover. There is a nice hydro pool and sauna which we used and enjoyed. Overall it just didn't feel as personal as the Egerton - it is bigger and it definitely suffers because of this. The staff were good, but not outstanding like in the Egerton. On our last day we decided to eat lunch in the restaurant. I had a burger…"
November 2012,another great experience at red carnation hotel,"I recently spent a week at the milestone and loved every minute. The room was beautiful, the staff couldn't have been nicer or more helpful and the bars and restaurants all perfect. I was there on business and the conceiges picked out perfect restaurants and handled all my business needs without a problem. I have stayed in many different hotels in london over the last few years and this is number one on my list now"
October 2013,Excellent Stay in London,"We stayed in the Milestone Hotel and we were extremely impressed. Andrew and the Staff were very attentive and helpful. The location was perfect, right near Hyde Park and close to a Tube station. Highlights were the breakfast and the bar. Our room was excellent, with great decorations and a balcony over the street. Thank you for the wonderful stay!"
September 2013,Perfection in everything,"The highest standards in everything in this  hotel. The hotel took you back in time to live the  English royal life. Room (305) is just perfect it makes you feel like a prince :). Decoration, colors, and room equipment is more than awesome. AC need some practice to master it and the king bed size was a little small for us. The bathroom was a little small but very clean and lovely.  English breakfast has everything you wish for.  Location is in the heart of high street Kensington which is face to face with tthe lovel Hyde park and near to many shopping attractions."
September 2013,Milestone Heaven,"This is by far one of the best small hotels that we have ever visited.  From the moment you check-in you are treated as a special guest.  We were given a tour of the facilities, taken to the room and shortly thereafter a welcome drink arrived.  A fruit platter was already in the room and all items requested prior to arrival (i.e.a pants press) were waiting.  We were on the breakfast plan and the selections left nothing to be desired.  We took advantage of the dinner option for each two nights of your stay and were allowed to utilize a credit of 25 pounds per person off the regular menu instead of using the fixed menu.  The food was fabulous!  Now a few words about the staff.  There is nothing that you want that they cannot handle.  From the front desk through the concierge,…"
June 2013,A very special hotel,"This was our third stay at the Milestone this year - following a recommendation by a friend when we were going to an event at the Royal Albert Hall in March.  We no longer wait for an excuse to stay here, such as going to an event in London - staying at the Milestone is an event in itself.  There are so many things to praise at this hotel that it's difficult to know where to start.  The rooms are beautifully decorated and furnished, as well as being so comfortable you don't want to leave them.  The breakfast is freshly cooked to order (my husband hates buffets) and most definitely worth the short wait.  Bathrooms have everything you could possibly want, including loads of unbelievably fluffy, soft towels, high quality Penhaligon toiletries and the best make up/shaving mirror I…"
July 2013,Terrific hotel experience,"We asked for rooms on an upper floor and away from ""the lift."" Our rooms were well-appointed and very quiet- we slept soundly every night. The hotel demonstrated a keen attention to detail in every respect. From the friendly greetings of the staff each morning, to the treats placed on our beds at night, we always felt welcome. The hotel itself is beautiful and historic, and has a lovely view of Kensington Gardens."
November 2012,An Ideal Home away from Home,"The Milestone Hotel is excellent in providing warm service and comfortable surrounds, leaving you wishing it was your home away from home. It feels distinctively British throughout the hotel, which is appropriate when you're staying in the heart of London.   Being centrally located, you get the best of everything during your stay. Step out and look ahead to see the impressive Kensington Gardens, look to the left to find shops accompanied by the hustle and bustle, and look to the right to spot the quieter part of town. It's a good area, and you will feel at ease walking around it.   You might notice a few complaints here about the size of the rooms, but we felt it was adequate given the context of staying in a heritage building in the city. After all, you wouldn't complain about…"
August 2013,My all-time favorite hotel,"From the moment you arrive you know you are someplace special.  The entire staff is kind, efficient, knowledgeable  and have impeccable manners.  Afternoon tea in the library is a real treat as is a classic cocktail served in the intimate equestrian-themed bar.  Rooms and suites are beautifully decorated and beautifully appointed.  We stay here whenever in London."
August 2013,Fantastic service,"They booked all our restaurants before we arrived and the restaurant recommendations they provided turned out to be great choices.  Our first room smelled of cigarette smoke but they managed to get us a new room immediately, despite being fully booked.  We celebrated our anniversary during our stay. The hotel celebrated with us by decorating our room with candles, rose petals all over the room and strawberries in chocolate. They also ensured that the restaurants celebrated with us. We got free champagne from one restaurant and happy anniversary written on the plate at another."
July 2013,Experience old English Hospitality,"By the end of the first day the doorman knew us, all one  would expect from a five star hotel. The rooms are tastefully done, bath has full size tub/shower that one can actually use.   Food and service is excellent   Location across from Kensington Gardens is  a short walk to Kensington Palace and  a short cab ride to many attractions. Would recommend the Milestone to those seeking a superior guest experience and, refined atmosphere. We hope  to return next year."
August 2013,Amazing Service!,"From the moment we arrived at the Milestone everything was taken care of. Traveling with 2 small children is sometimes a challenge. Not at The Milestone, they had little gift packages for our two girls and age specific! The staff is amazing remembering everything we liked and didn't like greeted always with a smile and truly cared about your stay. I never write reviews but The Milestone was far and above anything we have experienced in the past and felt it necessary to commend them on an amazing time.   Best,  The Day's"
July 2013,Best Hotel Experience EVER!,"My husband, 12 year-old son, and I just spent a week in London and we stayed at The Milestone Hotel. We knew it was a nice hotel but could never have imagined how PERFECT everything would be.   The hotel itself is beautiful and decorated so nicely. The atmosphere is comfortable and not too formal or stuffy despite the fact The Milestone is one of the best hotels in the world (Conde Nast Platinum Circle.) We felt welcome and very much at home. We found it most sad to leave at the end of our stay.  Our suite was gorgeous, roomy, quiet, and comfortable with a fantastic view of Kensington Palace. All of the rooms, suites, and apartments are decorated differently but all are beautiful. Several examples are available on the hotel website. When making our reservation by phone, I was…"
October 2013,"Milestone Hotel: A very, very British experience!","This boutique hotel with a Victorian ambiance, but an ultramodern bar and lounge is the ultimate in holiday indulgence...sherry served in the lobby, newspapers at your door, chocolates on the pillows each night, and a giant perfumed bath (bidet as well).  We were pampered by a kind, caring staff, we were served breakfast and high teas fit for royalty, and we were greeted with the very best of British charm. For a truly special holiday, I cannot recommend the Milestone enough. We're hoping to return soon.  -Dorothy Fried"
October 2013,Excellent experience at The Milestone,"We spent a very short 24 hours at the Milestone while in the UK visiting family, and we were treated to exceptional service.  A warm welcome, with our room ready within minutes of arriving, despite being a few hours ahead of check-in time (we only expected to drop off our bags) and we were offered complimentary drinks and homemade biscuits during the few minutes wait. The staff were all very welcoming and friendly and we were made to feel very at home and as though we were the only guests they were looking after! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxury, relaxing break away (our first night away from the children in 3 years) and you can be sure to get a very personal and welcoming experience.  I can also thoroughly recommend the massage at the spa,…"
September 2013,Little Gem in Central London,"Stayed 2 nights at this hotel last weekend. From the time we booked (with pre-stay questionnaire) everything was fantastic at this hotel. Check in was easy, lovely little tour of the main areas of the hotel offered, and accepted - made finding the dining room, bar etc easy the next time. Room 507 was lovely, very well equipped, super comfy beds and everything you could wish for in the room. Complimentary drink on arrival, option to have tea & coffee tray too. Housekeeping service was excellent, turn down service special and as an extra treat we came home on the Saturday evening to a romantic turndown with candles, chocolates and rose petals (big thank you to Fran here & for the lovely card). Doorman, concierge, everyone very helpful and accomodating. Our package included…"
October 2013,Wonderful stay,"Stayed four nights in sept 2013. Wonderful hotel, great staff and fabulous location. Room was lovely and size of the bathroom was an added bonus.  Food was great and bar was charming.  Thanks for the wonderful stay!"
October 2013,Fantastic Experience!,"Four nights at The Milestone wasn't enough. The staff is excellent, the amenities are top drawer, and the food is superb. Be sure to try the English Breakfast. We liked the location, next to Kensington Gardens, and within walking distance from a fun shopping district that included TK Max, Whole Foods, the Goat Restaurant, and Nando's. It's also a short walk to the Tube, the bus line and the ""Hop-on, Hop-Off"" tour bus routes (there are at least 4 in London - so select what you like)."
October 2013,First Class all the way.,"My Wife and I stayed here for a number of days in early October and enjoyed it immensely. Everything was excellent and well maintained. Ambience was opulent and classy. Our room was comfortable and tastefully decorated, although small for the furnishing level. Even though facing a fairly busy street, room noise level was negligible. (third floor). Public rooms were smaller but cosy. We especially enjoyed the pub, ending a couple of days relaxing and reading there. (I'm missing my Speckled Hen already!) Everything was immaculately clean. Overall the service was attentive, staff eager to help.  The check in process and greetings on arrival were flawless.  The extras were frequent and thoughtful (Arrival champagne, greeting fruit and pastries, nightly candies, little gifts, rose…"
October 2013,"Best Hotel in the World, not just London!",The best hotel I have ever stayed in!  The service was FIRST CLASS.  The rooms extremely beautifully done as well as spotless and clean.  I felt like a superstar staying there and cant wait to go back.  I agree with all the other 5 star comments on here!... Just book it.. you will love it!
September 2013,Most Amazing Hotel Experience,"Although some might consider this a ""small"" hotel it is ""big"" on uts focus on service and care of their customers.   From the comfort and amenities in the rooms to the range of dining options this is a hotel experience I will return to again and again."
September 2013,Beautiful historic hotel in a great neighborhood,"We stayed at the Milestone hotel and had a wonder stay.  The hotel is located right across from the Kensington park and it is only about 10 mins walk to the Tube.  The hotel is wonderful, with awesome service.  All the staff are super friendly and very helpful.  Breakfast is fabulous.  I would definitely stay there again!"
June 2013,Oasis of Serenity,If you want to experience London but still want to be able to find some peace and serenity when returning to your hotel for the evening then stay at the Milestone Hotel. A five star hotel where everyone knows your name. From the doorman to the baggage handlers to concierge to the front desk all have a smile and friendly hello each and every time they see you. The Butlers make a point to make you feel at home as you check in to your room and cannot do enough to make you comfortable. I have stayed at other hotels in London but this will be my home away from home when in London. A warm and cozy atmosphere whether dining or just having a drink at the bar ..it is a wonderful experience. Located just across from Kensington Park the hotel is away from the hustle and bustle  yet one can…
November 2013,Nice hotel,"Enjoyed staying here.  The service was great, as was the value.  I also had a great night sleep - very well rested.  My favourite aspect of the hotel though is the location - it's hard to beat being in the center of Kensington.  I'd recommend this to any couples out there looking for a romantic weekend in central London."
October 2013,Exceptional!,"I've stayed in many, many hotels - but I've never seen the attention to detail and care shown by the staff and management of The Milestone. The rooms are beautifully decorated, there are dozens of thoughtful little extras that the hotel does for the guests. The restaurant is superb and the gym and pool and more than adequate. I happily recommend The Milestone as one of the best (if not THE best) hotels I've ever stayed at."
September 2013,Lovely Mother-Daughter Weekend,"I LOVED the Milestone Hotel. It is right in Chelsea across from Kensington Palace. I have been to London many times and therefore did not need to be in the hub of London, making this a wonderful, quiet location. It is still within walking distance of so much, and is really quite peaceful. The hotel itself is clean, and the decor is classically British. I felt like a queen at the hotel. The rooms were beautiful, and the bathroom was fantastic. It was such  lovely atmosphere for a mother daughter weekend getaway.   The breakfast in the morning was delicious. The room it is in is beautiful as well. Overall, I think the grand decor of the hotel completely won me over."
September 2013,Best Afternoon Tea Period!,"If you're looking for a very special experience, look no further. We booked in advance and told them we were veggies and they catered specially for us. Chocolate scones and some of the most incredible cucumber sarnies I've ever had. Yum yum yum!"
November 2013,Great!!!!,"I was very astounded by the level of service in which the staff provides first to state, I do not usually write reviews but I definitely had to make a contribution here. I love love this hotel and will be back guaranteed. I actually live in London so I had no need to stay here but some friends decided to do something different and I joined them and I must say. It was worth it!"
November 2013,perfection,"Decided I needed a treat and a rest and had always intended to return since taking the whole family there last December for a 50th birthday celebration. Everything was perfect and I hope to return in Feb when visiting the ballet. Actually, I'd just like to live there!!!"
October 2013,Wow,"This hotel has to be the most wonderful place to stay in London. And I've stayed in a lot of them. Charming, boutique, friendly, clean, efficient, sumptuous...and any other superlative you care to take from the dictionary!"
November 2013,everything i hoped for...,"we save and plan and SAVE($$$) and plan for our vacations and i am exhaustive in my search for the perfect hotel. it is so hard when all the planning fails to meet my (very) high expectations. the milestone was all that and more. although we did not get the view room we were hoping for, we were moved after it was clear we were disappointed with our first room. the efforts they went to please us meant more than the view. while the room we ended up in did not have a view, it was very roomy with plenty of closet space, important for overpackers like us. we could use a little more counter space in the bathroom, but again, we take too much stuff. it was quiet and the bed and tons of pillows were so comfortable!! pedro was introduced as our butler and seemed to be there every time we…"
November 2013,"Excellent location, great service, very 'boutique'","Had two nights in the Milestone and couldn't fault it. Staff were excellent, rooms were spotless and the Stable Bar served excellent (strong) cocktails. Would certainly return. We found it by checking Tripadvisor and it came up trumps!"
November 2013,Beautiful genuine hotel with every touch of English charm,"Living in london - my family spent several days visiting… therefore I stayed much of my time at this hotel. And while this hotel is small, they certainly do think of everything. From drinking port after dinner in the small and charming polo bar, to having dinner by the roaring fire place - this hotel has everything to offer and is such a nicer and more memorable visit than some of the other larger luxury hotels such as the Savoy. Will hope to visit this hotel again and would recommend to anyone."
August 2013,ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL AND CHARMING BOUTIQUE HOTEL,"This beautiful mansion has gone through many iterations since it was built originally as a private home in 1689 --and has in the last few years been restored to perfection.  It has all the amenities you would expect of a five star experience.  The common areas and the rooms are spotless,the beds are wonderful, the staff could not be more accommodating - they go out of their way to be helpful.   The style of the property is luxurious Victorian (without feeling heavy) and you can sense the history in every corner. The tea/library room and dining area are just beautiful --all wood paneled and-small enough to be intimate, in keeping with the feel of a private home.  The food is excellent - the breakfast buffets are spectacular.  The only reason I gave this hotel 4 stars instead of 5…"
August 2013,Stay at The Milestone,"Truly an outstanding hotel from the minute I stepped into the Hotel till checkout. It's nice to be pleasantly surprised particularly for a jaded traveller. The hotel, the rooms, the staff all around the hotel were exceptional. About the best breakfast I've had in all of Europe. Best of all the Team at the hotel did not know how to say ""no!"" All the little touches by the housekeeping team, the implements in the room (just needs a nespresso machine and a kettle!) and facilities take it over the line as the best hotel I have stayed in; a real credit to the owners of the hotel. This is a lesson to the big hotel chains (St Regis Rome take note....) that you don't have to be big to be the best. I can't wait to try out the other hotels in the Red Carnation Group."
August 2013,"Excellent Service, Wonderful Staff","We ended a two weeks backpacking trip through Europe by staying two nights at the Milestone.   From the moment we booked our stay through when we boarded the taxi to return home, the service was impeccable. The reservations team, concierges, doormen, front desk staff, butler, bar manager, and servers were all second-to-none. It really improved our moods to be around people who liked to smile.   I would like to especially call out Markus, the bar manager, for knowing how to treat his guests, which was to treat them like dear old friends. When we played card games late into the nights in the bar, Markus would use his great sense of humor and wide array of knowledge to entertain us. Even as a frequent traveler, its not often I can put a name and face to a hotel. Joshua in concierge…"
August 2013,Always amazing,"Have lost count of the times we have stayed here. This hotel is simply amazing.  The staff are, without exception, fantastic. Very warm, welcoming and professional.  The room we had this time was on the front of the hotel with a view of the park. The glazing meant it was quiet and the air on kept the room cool.  We didn't eat in the restaurant as we were at the proms each evening but the breakfasts were great. Lots to choose from and all tasty.  I can't wait to come back!"
August 2013,A wonderful hotel!,"Our experience at The Milestone was great.  We checked in to interconnecting rooms that felt small for us and then we were moved to a phenomenal suite that suited us perfectly. Everyone at the hotel aimed to please, to be helpful, to be friendly and kind - from the concierges to the front desk to the people at the doorway to housekeeping, etc.  The decor of all spaces was gorgeous and care seems to have been given to all details of the hotel.  As wonderful as our room was, and as the downstairs areas were, what struck us most was the amazing staff.  We also liked the little treats on our bed every night, and all the nice touches that the hotel obviously puts great thought into.  My suggestion for people who wish to book interconnecting rooms is to see how much space there is in…"
August 2013,Quality of visit,our eigth visit One. Of the best hotels we have stayed in The staff are always on hand to help and advise but never intrusive. The rooms are clean and comfortable with everything available.The food is of the  highest standard and again we really enjoyed our stay and are already looking forward to our next visit.
May 2013,Fantastic birthday stay,"This hotel couldn't have been more perfect for celebrating my 40th birthday with my husband. We received a very friendly welcome upon arrival, our room -The Saville Row - was luxurious and comfortable, in particular the huge firm bed, the lovely window seats with a view over Kensington Gardens and the powerful ceiling shower. Later on we visited the stylish and relaxing hotel bar, where we had our welcome courtesy drinks, served by Dickson, the very friendly head barman.  After a great sleep, we were served a scrumptious breakfast, great menu and continental choice. All in all an excellent stay, highly recommend for a special occasion or frequent travelers wanting a home from home experience."
May 2013,Truly delightful,"If you have the opportunity, stay at the Milestone. We stayed there for a few days after a business trip to attend the Chelsea Flower show. The rooms delightful, the staff are helpful and genuine, the beds comfortable, the plumbing splendid, the food good, and the afternoon tea wicked! Loved the little Sherlock Holmes book on the bed the first night. Almost hated to go exploring in London. Thank you to all the staff for your obessional attention to detail."
August 2013,Superb Hotel,"The moment you enter The Milestone Hotel, the entire staff starts pampering you. They are all so friendly and hospitable, so this really is the home from home. Every detail is important. The rooms are spotless, there is fresh fruit at the table in the sitting area and before you realize that you will sleep like royalty, they bring up your welcome drink. The food is delicious and the drinks are of very high quality. Since we discovered this paradise on earth, we never stayed at another hotel in London..... Berthel ter Steege and Henk Buss, Haarlem, The Netherlands."
August 2013,Loved Every Minute of Our Stay!!,"I have stayed in many beautiful hotels around the world, but I have to say without a doubt, the Milestone is one of my favorites! Charming, cozy, elegant and unique are the first words that come to mind when remembering my stay there. The staff was friendly and helpful with our every need, from organizing guided tours to acquiring the tickets for the best shows at night. The restaurant was very good and the most impressive thing of all (for me) was afternoon tea. I had mentioned that my daughter was gluten intolerant and as they presented us a gorgeous tower of pastries and sweets to enjoy with our tea, they brought a second tower out that they made specially for her of gluten free sweets. The look on her face was priceless for me and it is this kind of attention to detail that…"
September 2013,Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon tea at the Milestone was an experience I won't ever forget! From the moment we stepped out of our taxi, to the moment we left the hotel, the service and attention we received was bar none. Every member of staff was helpful and kind.  My friend & I had our two small babies with us and we were all welcomed and helped in & out with our buggies. One member of staff brought me to the spa to change my baby. We were made to feel so welcome and so well looked after.  The tea itself was fantastic, the choices of pastries and sandwiches were so delicious and so were the scones. It was a highlight of my visit to London & I cannot praise the hotel & staff enough."
September 2013,As Good as Everyone Says,"We stayed at the Milestone in September as a celebration for my husband's birthday.  When we arrived at the hotel in our taxi, the bellman greeted us by name.   From the moment we entered the hotel, until we left, attention was given by the Milestone staff to make our stay as enjoyable as possible.  We regret that we could only stay one night.    We had the African room which was cozy, elegant and comfortable.  Perhaps it is the furnishings and lighting that make it so  extraordinary.  We have stayed in 5 star hotels before, but this one is at the top of our list.  The location is right by Kensington Gardens which is beautiful.  It is a 5 minute walk to the underground that is very easy to navigate.  If you want to splurge and stay somewhere really nice, look no further than The…"
September 2013,Absolutely lovely,"Booked this hotel based on tripadvisor reviews. It truly was a beautiful place to stay. The room we had was scrumptious. That added to all the little touches: hand written welcome note; cookies on arrival, chocs with turn down service; complimentary water; and so many towels and gowns we didn't know what to do with. The room was scrupulously clean. Service from all staff - impeccable. The hotel is located very close to High St Kensington tube station making it easy to get into the city but it's a ""nice"" area of London to come back to. Good shops and restaurants. We especially enjoyed being able to walk in Kensington Gardens (just across the road) after breakfast before heading out to hit the sights."
September 2013,Simply amazing,It was a real treat and a once a year splash for three nights in London recently with my partner. We chose The Milestone and we were not disappointed.  Attention to detail and all staff superbly attentive but no overkill. Special mention to Steve who is essentially the first person you meet when you pull up (in a taxi in our case). Great 'frontman' for the hotel. Very comfortable beds and suffice to say every need catered for in the well maintained rooms. Public areas a quality peaceful experience.  Thanks to all staff at The Milestone
September 2013,"Milestone Hotel,  London, England",My husband and I spent 2 nights. Best small hotel we ever stayed in. Beautiful and very comfortable.  Staff excellent gave attention to all our needs. Location is perfect for getting around London.  When they heard we were celebrating our anniversary they surprised us with a special night in our room with rose petals.  I was so surprised when we returned from a dinner out and walked into our rose covered room.  This was a truly a special gift.
September 2013,A Dream by Chance,"To celebrate a special birthday for my wife. Margaret I  decided to visit London and realy spoil her with two close friends we arrived at, unkown to us, AND BY SHEER CHANCE The Milestone in Kensington. The dream began from the moment the taxi arrived . Greeted by a cheerful ,helpful smartly dressed commissionaire who really set the standard. an attractive most obliging receptionist, Georgia, welcome drinks, light lunch, all. it seemed ,in a twinkling of an eye. Extremely high standard rooms, mouthwatering menu's with food served fit for a Queen.Even the house ladies said a cheerful hello in answering queries especially one lady from Columbia, so polite and happy to help juist all charming. Heading it all from arrival to departure was Manager Neil and his night staff Manager. A…"
December 2012,Beautiful boutique hotel with best staff on the planet,"My husband and I spent 4 nights here on a recent trip to London. The desk staff and concierges are first rate. However, the best doorman on the planet is a pleasant fellow named Patricio who always greeted us with a smile and friendly comment. We also enjoyed chatting with Anjia, the young woman from Poland, who tended bar and remembered our favorite drinks each night. The hotel upgraded us to the Harlequin Suite which was simply beautiful. Breakfast was bountiful. We thoroughly enjoyed afternoon tea which was substantial enough to substitute for dinner. Service during tea was a bit sloppy and slow but no big deal. Ultimately, this is a top of the line place with good service and a great location."
September 2013,Perfect London Christmas,"My wife and two teenage children stayed for a week over Christmas in 2012. We had never travelled to London so this was our first experience. First, the GM Andrew Pike and his entire staff are among the finest people we've met traveling. They made everything easy for us, but treated us like friends & family, not visitors. Their attention to detail was impeccable, from the decorated Christmas tree in our kids adjoining room, to stockings filled with gifts and breakfast on Christmas morning. I have to say that my wife and I were blown away at their hospitality. The location is perfect - right across from Kensington Palace in the neighborhood of Kensington, so you feel like a local more than a tourist. Several train stations are nearby walks, as well as a dozen restaurants, a Whole…"
March 2013,Romance!,"My husband and I stayed at the Milestone for our Wedding Anniversary and had the ""Romance Package"".  We were not disappointed, from the welcome to the check out we were made to feel special.  Our room was so well equipped with a lovely view, all the staff were helpful and friendly.  Would we stay again - in a heartbeat!"
September 2013,Great Hotel,"Loved my stay at this hotel, everything was to an extremely high standard and I can't wait to make my next booking. The rooms are just perfect and although I was in and out on business throughout my stay I couldn't wait to get back each time i left."
September 2013,As Good As Advertised,"My wife and I just stayed at the Milestone for the first time. It was an incredible experience from the moment we checked in. The staff is exceptional, and our stay couldn't have been better. This is a special place!"
October 2013,Excellent Hotel,"I happened on this Hotel by accident (my reservations having gotten screwed up) and I am glad that I did stumble across this place. This was, I think, in every way a superior Hotel to where I was supposed to stay. The staff were wonderfully helpful and friendly. The building and rooms were beautifully decorated and the bed was very comfy!"
October 2013,Passionate hospitality,"We recently stayed at The Milestone in London a Carnation Group hotel.  It was just lovely. The rooms are superbly decorated and the restaurant for breakfast/dinner superb.  The hotel is opposite Kensington Palace and is a really excellent location.  I was meeting a friend I hadn't seen for many years and although the hotel didn't actually serve lunch on Saturdays (afternoon tea only) when I mentioned this they actually did lunch just for us (four persons total) - that is amazing and the food was wonderful.  The staff, all of them, very helpful and professional. This is one of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in and I travel frequently. I made use of the in-house beautician and she was also excellent."
September 2013,Outstanding hotel and service,"We stayed last week for an anniversary treat and we would both say this hotel is hard to beat.  The staff were excellent, friendly, professional and enthusiastic.  The Milestone had decided to upgrade us and the room was spotless, beautifully decorated and with all kinds of extras.  We were touched to return from our meal out to find the room beautifully lit with candles and anniversary gifts.  Definitely a very special hotel to which we hope to return.Thank you to all at the Milestone."
August 2013,Simply outstanding,We spent 4 days in London on the way to Paris and a D-Day tour of Normandy. Several people recommended The Milestone as their favorite hotel in London. Good advice. I would describe it as a 5 star boutique hotel. It is adjacent to Kensington Park and Kensington Palace as well as Whole Foods of London (which is also worth a visit). The tube is nearby and there are always cabs awaiting. The hotel also has a Rolls Royce available.  The staff was very attentive and solicitous and actually addressed guests by memorizing their names. We had a spacious sunny corner suite... The hotel is small and luxurious and very British.
September 2013,A great place to stay,"I had an appointment in London at the end of August, so we decided to combine business with some shopping and sightseeing and stay somewhere really special. We decided to try the Milestone Hotel after seeing the excellent reviews on Trip Adviser. We were not disappointed. We were checked in by Neil, the Front of House Manager. He was friendly and efficient and quickly made us feel very welcomed. After a quick tour of the hotel, we were then shown up to our room. We stayed in the English Rose room. This room was a good size, beautifully decorated, and had glorious views over Kensington Gardens. The bathroom also had a luxurious feel and looked especially nice at night with soft lighting and candles. There were fresh flower arrangements in the bedroom and bathroom too. We also…"
September 2013,Expectations Met,"From the moment we arrived we were greeted like we were returning to our home. The staff of this property are both extremely friendly, yet professional. Our junior suite was spacious by London standards and was a nice mix of modern with traditional amenities. The hotel's bar was cozy and fun. We looked forward to returning for drinks at the end of each day. Breakfast and afternoon tea were outstanding. Tourist sights were easy to get to by either the Tube or the hop on/off bus tour, but we preferred actually staying in the lovely Kensington neighborhood. The Milestone Hotel was the perfect choice for our time in London and we will be back!"
September 2013,"NO REQUEST IS TOO LARGE, NO DETAIL TOO SMALL",The payoff of the hotel perfectly fits the extraordinary experience of staying at the Milestone. I absolutely loved dining at the Cheneston's and I want to thank everybody for making my staying in London simply unforgettable! I
March 2013,Service is key here,"Although the Milestone was not close to anything we were in London to see, it was a quick ""tube"" ride to anywhere we were headed.  Other than having to wait to check in, the service in this hotel was amazing.  From the concierge Jose', to the amazing bartender and including the ""always there"" Julie, the service was impeccable.  For my birthday, I came back to the room that night to find a birthday cake, rose petals on the bed and in the bathtub and lit floating candles in glass vases everywhere.  It was beautiful.  We had a great view of Kensington Park and everytime we left the property the bellman was friendly, calling us by name, and helpful. There were quite a few people staying there that make the Milestone a yearly visit. The keyword for this hotel is ""Service"""
October 2013,Just great,"This beautiful hotel in Kensington has such an excellent service. One is greeted with a personal touch and you feel very welcome. The breakfast is the best I can remember, I wish I could eat there every morning....   The bar has excellent cocktails, beware of the Vesper cocktail, It kicks like a mule...  Our room was beautiful, quiet and extremely comfortable.  The location of the hotel is very good, we took the tube every time as this was very easy to get around London."
July 2013,Fantastic,"Nothing about the hotel is worth a negative word.  Just excellent.  A little problem with the concierge advance help.  The Guidelines of Britain tour was 400 pounds and did not know the daily W. Abbey schedule so it was closed and we mostly just drove around in circles.  Guide was dry and monotone, did OK with the Changing of the Guard viewing.  Also, we paid for Big Bus tickets and they were never delivered.  Did not use them since we had to go to the Abbey the next day on our own.  Still, they might have delivered the tickets to us or at least asked about them?"
June 2013,Wonderful small hotel,"We recently spent two nights at the Milestone and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is a small hotel in an excellent location across from Hyde Park.  The staff was very friendly, polite and attentive. Overall, the service was excellent and the decor interesting. The rooms a bit small but very comfortable.  By the time we left most of the staff knew us by name. A first class operation.   Highly recommended.  Would definitely return."
July 2013,Wonderful experience,Stayed for 5 nights as part of my husband's 50th birthday celebrations.  Knew it was going to be a lovely experience when we found a birthday cake in our room made by the hotel's chef especially for our arrival.  It was this attention to detail that made our stay truly memorable.  We had a lovely room overlooking the grounds of Kensington Palace.  The hotel has a great location which makes getting around London very easy.  Excellent.
July 2013,An Absolutely Outstanding Hotel!,A truly memorable stay in a hotel that thoroughly deserves its No. 1 Trip Advisor ranking.  From arrival to departure the experience was unmatched.  The historic charm of the hotel and its great location overlooking Kensington Gardens were complemented by service levels and staff who went out of their way to make our stay the highlight of a 3 month trip through Europe.  We couldn't recommend this hotel more highly!
July 2013,The best of new and old London,My family and I recently spent a week in London and enthusiastically recommend the Milestone.  We booked the hotel at the recommendation of friends because they offer two adjoining rooms that can be configured with one entry door providing separate space for families traveling with children.  This set-up worked well for us.    While the rooms were not large and the hotel itself is not terribly large this only added to the charm and intimate feel.  The hotel is approximately 125 years old and has been very tastefully renovated.  It has modern amenities while staying true to its architectural style and decorations. The beds were comfortable.  The showers hot and relaxing (for London) and you could make the room any temperature necessary. The towels and linens were great and the…
March 2013,Lived up to High Expectations,"I stayed at the Milestone largely because of the great reviews on Tripadvisor.  It definitely lived up to the expectations.  I was greeted by one of the bellman (believe his name was Fran) as soon as I stepped out of the cab, he walked me to the front desk where I checked in.  He then gave me a quick tour of the hotel and then showed me to my room.   My hotel room (believe it was called the Matisse Studio), was very well appointed.    I would definitely recommend having drinks in the lounge at some point.  The bartender, Dickson, does a great job.  Both his drinks and his conversation were excellent.  The food was superb.  I had dinner there one day with a friend from London.  We were a little nervous because we were the only people in the restaurant (it was a Sunday night), but…"
June 2013,Best Afternoon Tea,"Hotel is an old English building that has been renovated. You can have  afternoon tea in one of the salons and seat there to talk. Amazing value  extremely cosy place.  Its my best afternoon tea place in London.  There is also beautiful cocktail bar.  Location is convenient in the center of London and in front of Kensington parl / palace. It is easy to find place to park vehicle nearby and bus to go to Piccadilly.  Excellent staff and service.  If you are a person that does not like something private, this is the place."
June 2013,A Royal Experience,This was our first time at The Milestone but it certainly won't be our last.  From the moment you walk up the steps you are treated like Royalty.  The staff is professional and extremely helpful.  Our room was quite large and beautifully decorated.  The bathroom was amazing and I’ve never seen so many towels!!!   Each time we walked thru the lobby we were asked if we needed anything before we had to ask.  What terrific service.  We thoroughly enjoyed the food & the intimate living room live with a piano player.  We had theater tickets our first night so we needed to eat early.  The hotel arranged for the chef to open the dining room early to accommodate our time schedule & our dinner was delicious and served in a timely manner so we were right on time for our show.  Anyone…
June 2013,outstanding,"we only stayed for one night for my husbands birthday and I can honestly say we have never been so well looked after and thoroughly spoilt.the staff are so friendly but not too familiar.they looked after us with genuine care.the breakfast was also lovely as was the birthday cake the bought up to our room as a surprise.we can't wait to go again,it will just take me another year to save up.thankyou milestone"
June 2013,Wonderful experience,"This was the finest hotel I'd ever stayed at. The building and rooms were magnificent, the position excellent, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly. The breakfast dining room was particularly lovely and elegant."
July 2013,My family of 4 were treated like royalty!,"Wow, where to begin? My husband stays in London for business fairly regularly, so this time we decided to tag along with our 12 and almost 11 year old kids. As world travelers themselves, they cannot stop raving about the milestone! We had adjoining rooms that seemed tailor made for us, and we loved the personalized attention to details both big and small. For example, our wonderful waitress at breakfast named Kristina remembered our breakfast favorites from each day, and this not only made ordering easy, but thrilled the kids and made them feel special. Needless to say, she got a big American hug from us all when we left! The afternoon tea was a highlight, and when we were too stuffed to finish all of the goodies, a delicious platter of scones showed up a while later in our…"
June 2013,They go the extra mile on service,"We stayed here following the excellent reviews on TA and were prepared to be disappointed.  We were not. In this hotel, service is almost an obsession. We tested it in many ways from changing one of the chairs in the room to helping us cope with moving an electric mobility cart in and out of the hotel. Everything was done effortlessly and with extreme professionalism. The room we were in was not large but it was well laid out.   The fitness room was excellent and they have even managed to get a lap pool into the basement.    Wifi is free and fast although this needed codes on every use which became a small irritant (and something I am sure they will change).   On reviewer called this the best hotel in the world bar none. We have great difficulty refuting this and if you want to…"
June 2013,"THE BEST HOTEL IN THE WORLD, BAR NONE!","The most incredible, fabulous, friendly and home from home accommodation anywhere in the world. Having looked on Tripadvisor for a quality hotel in the Kensington area, I noted how well the reviews and ratings were for The Milestone Hotel so I called them up. From the get-go the lady in reservations was so attentive to my enquiry, promising me an unbelievable experience at The Milestone. She was not wrong, from the moment my Wife and I were greeted by the tall and charming doorman, onto reception, then into our fabulous suite, the Hotel and staff were like nothing we've ever experienced ever before. To write down everything that occurred would take far too long and would never be able to describe how incredible our stay was at this fine establishment. The opulence, attention to…"
February 2013,one of the best period hotels of london,"great location, perfect service, excellent accommodation. concierge is on the most friendly and knowledgeable persons in any hotel i have stayed in london, great access to shopping, theatre and transport as well as sight seeing.   the restaurant can do with more friendly staff, as well as a wider selection of food menu options. recommend that you eat out of the hotel.   the spa is also wonderful as is the swimming pool."
June 2013,Delightful place for a milestone birthday.,"Time seems to have gotten away from me, as it's been some months since my friend and I stayed at The Milestone. I was celebrating a ""big"" birthday and we had spent several days in Paris and had stayed at another London hotel before arriving at The Milestone. Check-in was welcoming and efficient and we were quickly shown to our room. When I expressed dissatisfaction with the size of the room, we were just as quickly taken back to reception and in minutes were given a more spacious, and I suspect upgraded, room. Everything we needed was provided in the room or brought to us upon request. There was even a surprise birthday cake waiting for us one evening. As apart of a promotional offer, we were given dinner at Cheneston's, the hotel's restaurant and found the food to be delicious.…"
July 2013,"SUPERB SERVICE, EXCELLENT LOCATION","Charming boutique hotel, with smallish rooms, not unusual for London, but immaculately appointed.  Great walks in Kensington neighborhood, nearby and across the street, Kensington Gardens and maybe you will glimpse Kate or William flying in on helicopter. First floor room facing busy street but NO Noise. Housekeeping regularly tidied my messy room during 3 day stay. Excellent breakfast, expensive drinks and dinner but great ambiance. Helpful, efficient, knowledgeable concierge. Will come again."
July 2013,what a great place,"If you like a traditional hotel which really works than this is a good choice. It is expensive, but the quality of the accommodation, the service and the 'experience' is well worth it. I had lunch too and the traditional fine dining for an extended lunch is a real treat. We had only starters with wine, but the quality of the scallops my friend had and the hunter salad I had were really good. No need for an amuse guelle, but the tuna salad went down like a treat. Shame not more people make use of it, but it is most probably the price. They really go the extra mile there."
July 2013,Engagement Paradise!!,"What more can I say about our experience at the Milestone except, we were treated like royalty and nothing was ever too much!  I planned to propose to my girlfriend so went to the hotel the day before and they were so helpful.  They through in early check-in and a complementary turndown (ie moood candles, rose petals, mood lighting, chocolate-dipped strawberries & a rose on the bed) on the house! Which they put in place while my now fiance and I were out visiting the sights during the day. She said Yes, by the way!! :-)  The butler who greeted us was very polite and gave us a guided tour of the hotel and facilities and also a complimentary welcome drinks and snacks at th bar that all new guests get on arrival.  There was a personal greeting card from the manager in our room on…"
July 2013,Going the extra mile at Milestone,"My husband and I spent 2 days at this hotel.  It is a very convenient to walk to Hyde Park,  Kensington Palace,  or to pick up a tour bus of the city. The concierge recommended a restaurant for dinner that was terrific. We had a very early flight from the hotel and missed breakfast. ( unfortunate)  However, the staff went out of their way to give us coffee to go and warm croissants in a box.  I was impressed."
July 2013,Milestone for families,"Our family of five - my husband and I and our three girls (ages 7,10 & 11) stayed at the Milestone in July..  It was during a beautiful stretch of weather in London. The hotel's location is excellent and allows you to take advantage of Kennsington Park (across the street). The service at the Milestone was terrific and was very gracious and accommodating to our children. We stayed in Apartment 4 - the apartments are a great choice for families giving us a great deal of room to spread out. The breakfast in the morning was delicious and had a good variety of choices.   I had tried to get tickets for ""Matilda"" on my own the month before for a Saturday night and only single seats in the balcony were available. I emailed Jose the concierge at the Milestone and he secured us five sets…"
June 2013,Amazing.,"A fantastic service, outstanding level of quality, facilities and ammenities.  You will fell like in your home. Try the evening tea. In my opinion on  the best localization of London. Calm and comfortable. The Hide Park is in front of Hotel. Perfect to running in the morning,  before a very respectful breakfast."
June 2013,Mostly great!,"The Milestone Hotel is in a great location, we really found it super easy to get about London. Many attractions are within walking distance and the tube stop is just around the corner (High Street Kensington). We found our room to be a bit on the small side, and it was decorated in sort of a Moroccan/Modern theme, which was a bit odd considering we were hoping for that quintessential ""English"" feel that carries throughout the rest of the hotel, but the room was nice and clean nonetheless. The only issue was the shower drain was a bit clogged (water would build up in the tub while taking a shower which is always a bit annoying). The complementary drink and snack were a warm welcome, especially after 18 hours of travel time. We also enjoyed dining in the restaurant for breakfast…"
June 2013,"Ambience, location, service culture - OUTSTANDING!","So much has been written about The Milestone before our stay, I am not sure what we can add except to echo those who loved this gem of a hotel. We arrived very late on Sunday night, but we were greeted warmly, thoroughly debriefed on the hotel and its amenities, given a brief tour and escorted to our room. Coffee service was delivered the next morning at exactly the time ordered. We were on our honeymoon and the staff had clearly been briefed beforehand as the offers of congratulations came from everyone. When we came back to the room on our second night, the room was lit with candles, and rose petals were strewn (more like perfectly placed!) throughout the room, bath, bed, night stands, etc. Perfectly romantic and a lovely personal touch. We were simply enchanted by our…"
June 2013,Superb accommodations and service,"I was at the Milestone Hotel for 2 nights as a layover. It is a wonderful boutique hotel where no detail is too small or request too large.  My room was very comfortable with every amenity I needed, room service for breakfast and the hotel restaurant were both outstanding. Afternoon tea was classic English and wonderful. The hotel is directly across the street from Hyde Park, a short walk to a London Underground station, and surrounded by dozens of great restaurants.  Key features for me in a hotel are lots of hot water, good water pressure, and reliable internet.  The Milestone gets an A+ on all areas.  The best feature of the Milestone Hotel is how wonderful and accommodating the staff is from the doorman to the front desk, the waiters and anyone I came in contact with.  The…"
June 2013,I'll go there as long...,"It is not to room 409,this terrible room doesn't open the windows and air condition alone is suffocating.I love everything about the Milestone and I went back after traveling through the continent and than went to a much nicer room.if you like tea, the breakfast tea is the best in England.Staff couldn't be better.This was my 4th stay so I hope going back"
May 2013,WONDERFUL HOTEL,"We arrived by taxi to be greeted very warmly by name .All staff were very friendly ,polite and very mannerly.They anticipated our needs and would suggest helpful options.The food was superb.Decor out of this world,understated elegance.I loved their attention to detail,everything was in the room,bathroom that you might need.We had a guest for dinner one evening and we were so happy to see that the guest's menu did not show the prices so that our guest could order anything without feeling uncomfortable.I loved their good manners and sensitivity.The staff seemed to be fluent in  many languages .We will be going back there for our next break.The location is brilliant , near bus stop and tubes,taxis passing every minute.It was the best holiday we had for years."
November 2012,Family trip,"The Milestone made for an unbelievable week for our family (kids ages 11, 8, 6).  The service there was fantastic and all staff were welcoming and helpful.  We stayed in one of their apartments which was beautiful and gave plenty of space for a family of 5.  The kids loved the breakfast buffet, indoor pool and treats on their pillows at night.   The location is perfect across the street from Kensington gardens and a 5 minute walk to the Princess Diana playground.  We will be back!!"
June 2013,Wonderful,Can't begin to express how kind and generous the entire staff was in looking after our family of four.  One of those hotels where the kids remember the doorman's name and talk about the hotel as much as some of the sights.  Terrific.
May 2013,Best experience,"It was my 1st visit in London and I am so glad to choose to stay at The Milestone. Everything amazed me: the welcome tea pack and snacks, the weather forecast card, the awesome cookies etc. Really like the service and deco. The only thing is I didn't check the floorplan on the website when I booked a room. I should have picked a vintage one! Hey guys, you really should try this hotel and I promise you wouldn't regret!  中国的朋友，个人强推这家酒店，对面就是海德公园，任何方面都不输四季万豪希尔顿等五星级酒店。绝对是伦敦最好的！"
June 2013,Fantastic service,"I realized today that despite having stayed at this hotel several times, most recently in May 2013, and having thoroughly enjoyed it each time, I've never written a review of it. It's high time!  The service we've experienced at The Milestone is truly amazing. From our very first stay, we have been treated like gold.  On one stay, we had to depart at 3:30 am. We were both slightly ill, and our car to the airport was delayed in arriving at the hotel. We were slumping on seats in the lobby while we waited for our car, feeling miserable and without enough sleep. The front desk, noticing we were not doing so well, brought us tea and coffee and some pastries, on the house. They just could not have been nicer to us.  The staff offer complimentary tea or coffee brought to our room when…"
April 2013,The best service in the world,"If your ego requires a giant useless lobby you are simply missing one of the finest hotels not merely in London but in the world. The service is simply extraordinary by even demanding measures, the rooms are generous, the location is spectacular. My home in London for decades to come (I hope)."
April 2013,"Wonderful, splendid, stylish hotel with great staff","J spent two fantastic days with my wife in this marvelous, very beautiful hotel. We extremely enjoyed the time in an unique suite with a four poster bed and very beautiful antique furniture including Victorian windows and the viws towards Kensington Gardens and Palace. Many thanks to Angelina and Fraj. They were very friendly and helpful! The public area inside the Hotel  is also very special and beautiful. Everything is perfect including all details. We really highly recommend this wonderful Milestone Hotel and we already look forward to come back soon."
May 2013,Unique hotel,"My friend and I recently spent a wonderful night at this beautiful hotel.  Immaculately clean, friendly staff, delicious food.  Ideal location with views of Kensington Palace and very close to the Royal Albert Hall, only took us 10 minutes to walk to this venue for a show."
May 2013,A True Oasis,The Milestone Hotel is a truly unique and special experience. We were return guests and were ever more pleased by this fantastic and friendly hotel. The hotel itself is a beautifully designed property with stunning views over Kensington Palace and the grounds. Each room is a uniquely designed home away from home.  The Stables Bar is a real treat as is the Library and Chenestons Restaurant.  Most importantly the service at this hotel is incomparable.  You are treated royally from the first hello to the last goodbye.  A true 5 star hotel in every way!
March 2013,excellent stay,had a wonderful stay at this hotel as usual. Every time time in London I stay there for several reasons: - excellent location - you not only enjoy the views of Hyde Park and Kensington Palace but also enjoy comfortable sorrundins of Kensington High and Noting Hill - traditional english interior - although I like more modern hotels it is not the case for the Milestone English tradition is just as it should be not too much - excllent service and staff - peple working in the hotel know you in person and always do their best to make you feel as confortable as possible - I have even received a birthday cake for my birthday))  Highly recommended!!!!
April 2013,Everything was very good,"Everything was very good. The location of the hotel is excellent. Some thing very special! Staff so helpful and professional! All in all, perfect place to go to visit the city and have good transport links within close proximity. I hope will be there soon."
May 2013,"""Home From Home""","We were fortunate to have chosen this lovely small hotel as a base from which to explore some of London's attractions.  Located in Kensington, it is away from the city center and theaters, but with access to the park and some local shopping, and taxis were plentiful.  The room was quaint and lovely, and well-thought-out, but the major appeal here is the staff, who are truly devoted  to providing outstanding service.  Fran, who showed us around the property and generally looked after our welfare, Jack and the ladies in the dining room, who appeared to actually enjoy our daily breakfast arrival, the concierge staff Edward and Joshua, who obtained concert tickets while I was still standing at the desk requesting them, were, in an overused word, truly amazing.  Of course, there are…"
June 2012,Gracious luxury,"We splurged on this trip to London and wow, was it worth it for us.  From the late night enthusiastic and warm greeting, to our sad last goodbye, we were treated better than family at the Milestone.  Our rooms were beautiful (we stayed twice in one week), with luxurious bedding, and elegant decor.  The bathrooms were a really nice suprise - spacious, marble with modern plumbing, thick monogrammed towels and robes, and nice amenities.  The bed was the comfiest most welcoming bed I've ever slept in away from home.    The staff was extraordinary in every way.  Ever helpful, but not invasive, in an always smiling, can't do enough for you and glad you are here kind of way.  From the door man (Stephen), to the concierge (Joshua), the check-in staff, wait staff and bar staff - we felt…"
April 2013,luxury in london,"Fantastic hotel in Kennsington, 5 mins from the Albert Hall. Super friendly staff in this small but luxurious hotel. One of the best restaurants in London and a fantastic cocktail bar. Rooms are individual, very confortable and private."
April 2013,A little piece of heaven in a big city,"This year was our 5th year traveling to London for my husband's job.  Every year we ago we stay at a new hotel (haven't found the perfect one).  I love the Kensington area, so decided to try the Milestone Hotel (reviews were good and I read that it just recently had been refurbished).    The Milestone Hotel did not disappoint.  It was a wonderful experience and this is the hotel that we will be returning to every year.  We loved it!"
May 2013,Fabulous Stay!,"My husband and I had a two night/ three day stop over in London on our way to Switzerland. We were looking for an atmospheric and comfortable boutique hotel in a decent location. This one fit our needs and much much more! We arrived in the early morning after an exhausting overnight flight from Asia. The staff efficiently made sure we were quickly and comfortably esconced in a lovely room overlooking the park, complete with a tray of tea and biscuits served on gorgeous china  to welcome us. The breakfast room is adorable, the pub, ""the stables,"" lively and fun in the evening. All food and the drinks we consumed were delicious and made to perfection. The staff was considerate and very attentive. Early evening, a knock on our room door would result in a waiter bearing a tray of…"
June 2013,Be treated like a royal,"Just  spent 10 glorious nights at the Milestone in a two bedroom apartment.  Truly we were treated like we were royals.  Our room had everything we needed and we loved the special treats that were left on our beds at night.   Room service was fantastic if we didn't feel like going out at night.  Let's not forget the great breakfast which has everything you desire. Even though it might not be cheep to stay at the Milestone, treat yourself to a few days of pampering. Don't forget to go to their bar and have a few drinks.  Location is great also, across the road from Kensington Palace and close to the train. Only one other point I can make is please open a Milestone in Australia."
June 2013,Best of the best!,"This was the third time we stayed in the Milestone Hotel and we hope there will be many times more! We do sometimes treat ourselves with a stay in this hotel. The service is excellent especially the room service at night. When you return to your room after dinner the music is playing, there is a candle in the bathroom, water by you bedside, candies on your pillow and soforth. Than in the morning there is breakfast, delicious and a wide choice. Try the pancakes or french toast! The staf is always frienly and helpful and make you feel like a VIP. We highly recommend this hotel and hope to be back very soon!"
June 2013,As always BRILLIANT!!,"We are regulars at the Milestone, this time 3 days with two good friends, we were off the the Rod Stewart concert at the 02 Area. Used all the facilities of this excellent Hotel. From the moment you arrive until the guys at the front of the Hotel wave you off there is no better place to stay. We took the oppertunity to have a picnic in the park, they carried the basket over, laid out the food and even offered to come back and collect it all! Colin the chauffer was excellent he took us over to the 02 , nothing was too much trouble. I needed to have a breakfast business meeting, all arranged no issues and perfect service. For these guys NOTHING IS TO MUCH TROUBLE."
May 2013,A highlight of our trip to London,"What an amazing hotel the Milestone is!  Our family was making our first trip to London and we wanted it to be special. We knew accommodating a family of 6 would be challenging and it was important to me that we find a place that could keep us all together, rather than have to get three separate hotel rooms.  A friend/travel agent told me about the Milestone and suggested we book one of their apartments (they have 6 in conjunction with the hotel).  It was the best decision we made.  We enjoyed a two bedroom, two bath apartment with two day beds in the living room that made into comfortable beds.  The furnishings were beautiful and every detail was attended to.  From the gorgeous window boxes outside, to the beautiful linens and toiletries inside, we knew we were in very good…"
July 2012,Great Experience,"We stayed at The Milestone for seven nights and didn't want to leave. We had a beautiful, yet small, room with a gorgeous spacious bathroom. The service was great with much appreciated attention to details. The location for us was perfect, close to the Tube and in a neighborhood rather than just a tourist area. The lobby, bar and sitting rooms are gorgeous and very inviting. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend The Milestone to anyone who wants a special place to stay while in London."
February 2013,A special place in heart of London,The most friendly hotel I have ever stayed in.  Everything you could need was provided for with fantastic service – definitely top of my list.  The hotel has beautiful rooms with every possible feature you could desire including a great location for Hyde Park and other attractions.  I have since visited other Red Carnation Hotels based on this experience - they are very special.
May 2013,A bygone Era,"You know how you sometimes just walk past a place and you get an immediate and certain sense of quality and pride? The Milestone does just that. It starts with the immense attention to detail in the carefully arranged window boxes outside on the railings. And just builds and builds as you walk through the entrance doors. The staff are attentive, the decor classic, the rooms elegant and the food and wines just great. This is a real one off gem. A large fortune must have been invested to get it looking this good. It's like an immaculate film set. I could see a beautifully photographed period film being made right here. The location is superb for shopping in elegant surroundings and a long walk in the park. This is a hotel to be savoured. So arrive early, book a dinner in the very…"
May 2013,6-Star Service,"The Milestone Hotel was at the end of a couple of weeks in England and by far it was the best experience we had during the trip. In fact it is one of the best hotels I have stayed in ever, mostly down to the service and attention to detail from the staff.  The property itself is well maintained and has a charming and sometimes quirky style to the decor. Every room is different and when we arrived in our room our porter made sure to ask us if we were satisfied. We definitely were- the room was an interesting split-level type with a (what we imagine to be) British style decor. Not large but very pretty and there were little details everywhere that we were still discovering as we checked out a few days later.   The area around the hotel has a fair amount of restaurants, a number of…"
April 2013,superb afternoon tea,"so many hotels offer afternoon tea, it is becoming very difficult to choose! I wanted to celebrate a birthday in a special way(as many of us do) and did not want to feel just like another tourist in London. Was particularly attracted to The Milestone via the website and the most lovely video, also by the fact that they thoughtfully cater for children with the Little Prince or Princess teas. Never having been here before or indeed not knowing anyone who had ,I took a chance and was NOT disappointed. The hotel, the staff and the tea were simply wonderful!!! This is a must for anyone who wishes to think their money well spent.We were made to feel most welcome and nothing was too much effort, even when we wished to try three different teas during our most relaxed 2hours! Our 8yr old…"
May 2013,A great hotel,"I recently stayed at the The Milestone, traveling as a party of three adults. It is truly a remarkable hotel -- the service is FANTASTIC. The concierge staff, in particular, was about the best I have experienced. We rented a two-bedroom apartment, which was beautifully appointed and perfect for three adults who want privacy in their rooms, but also want to easily spend time together when not out touring. The price was exceedingly reasonable, in my opinion. The only complaints, and they are pretty minor, is that I didn't think the furniture in the living room (although beautiful) was all that comfortable for watching tv or sitting around to chat. The internet connection was also spotty, and we had to move around to find the hotspots (which weren't in the bedrooms). Both of these…"
May 2013,Service was some of the best i have experienced,"My husband and I stayed here for one night after the Chelsea flower show and had a lovely time; we only wished we could have stayed here longer  The staff were courteous to the end, showing us around, being incredibly polite and extremely helpful (an unfortunate rarity in Britain)  The room was beautiful (split level, quirly design and a lot larger than we expected) and very clean and the level of detail was phenomenal-there was a handwritten card to us, a handwritten nite on the comlimentary tea bags and little bits all over the room which didnt go unnoticed or appreciated. The concept is all about the detail and they get this spot on (the evening service lights a candle in the bathroom fo you-very nice with the complimntary champagne on arrival)  The location is excellent for…"
May 2013,Simply fabulous!,"We swung by the Milestone on our way between Monaco and Bournemouth (interesting detour!) for afternoon tea.  What an absolute delight!  Firstly the building itself and its outlook are second to none in London.  Why waste your time in some run of the mill, faceless chain hotel where here you can receive such personal service and excellent cuisine that will exceed all your expectations!  Must be operating under great management, that's all we can say.  We'll most definitely be back!"
May 2013,A perfect anniversary retreat,"We stayed at The Milestone Hotel in the Prince Albert suite for our first wedding anniversary and it couldn't have been any more perfect. Ideal location, fantastic service, amazing room and sunshine! (admittedly the latter probably wasn't provided as part of the service and was just luck). We didn't try the restaurant so can't comment on this but we did order room service at 1pm which was turned around quickly and had breakfast in the room which was fantastic. Would we do it again? Absolutely but next time we will stay for longer and try out the restaurant."
November 2012,An oasis in London,"The Milestone's location can't be beaten:  in Kensington across from Hyde Park.  The rooms are absolutely soundproof and beautifully decorated, with a touch of whimsy.  The staff is unbelievably responsive to the slightest request.  The hotel dining room is a very fine restaurant, even for breakfast.  The concierge is completely knowledgeable and kind.  I cannot say enough good things about this hotel."
May 2013,Wonderful & Peaceful Afternoon Tea,"My husband and I just enjoyed a wonderful tea session at the Milestone. I chose The Milestone because I wanted to relax and enjoy my tea in a quite & cozy environment (vs.the hustle, bustle and impersonal service of some of the larger establishments). The Milestone suited our needs perfectly. The interior design was tastefully and elegantly decorated in a Victorian library motif and the limited number of seating provided the intimate air that I absolutely adored. The sandwiches, pastries and scones were plentiful and varied. The service was impeccable, very polite and unhurried. I cannot say enough about this hidden gem of a place and would recommend it to anyone looking to experience a delightfully delicious and relaxing tea service!"
May 2013,The Palace May Be Across the Park But The Royal Treatment is Here,"It has been two days since we closed the door on Room 308 at The Milestone and made our way back to the US. I like to think a style of living in that Regency Suite for a few days will stay with us for a long time. My husband and I checked in to The Milestone as a base for our first visit to The Royal Horticulture Society's Chelsea Garden Show. Being escorted up the steps of that grand old red brick building and crossing the threshold into the small sophisticated lobby, we knew we had entered a new world of old values--one of courtesy, respect, consideration, duty and etiquette. The art of civility is not lost, it can be found 24/7 at The Milestone. The palace may be across the park but the royal treatment is here. Time seemed to slow down inside those lovely old front doors.…"
February 2013,Good old fashioned service.,"From the moment you arrive you can expect and will receive first class service. The building , location , staff and food are great. We have just visited for a second time and found it to be even better than our last visit.We will certainly go again."
April 2013,First class hotel,"My husband and I have stayed at The Milestone three times and we now consider it our favourite hotel in London. The friendly staff make you feel very welcome and nothing is ever too much trouble.They always remember what pillows we prefer, what newspaper we read and the names of our children! Afternoon tea served in The Park Lounge is a real treat. Its elegant architecture,  beautifully designed rooms along with attention to detail and courteous staff make it a very special hotel."
May 2013,wonderfull fantastic splendid hotel...,my partner and i have just returned from this fine establishment on business the staff here made our stay very special indeed Immaculately clean friendly staff glorious food great location very very special i would like to thank every member of staff for making our stay so warm and relaxed
April 2013,"Wonderful hotel, thoughtful service","The Milestone is a lovely hotel - beautiful accommodation and thoughtful service without any stuffiness. My partner and I stayed for a business trip combined with a birthday celebration, and the staff at the Milestone made our stay very special. They were so welcoming and courteous that we relaxed immediately.  Our room was exquisitely decorated and spotless, with a wonderful view of the park. I don't always sleep well when travelling, but not a problem here - the bed was exceptionally comfortable with gorgeous linens. This is a true gem, looking forward to our next visit."
April 2013,Excellent stay,"I stayed at this hotel twice during my last Easter holidays in London. Though the rooms are not very spacious but the service offered by their staff  is simply superb and deserves its name as 5 stars category.   The staff are friendly and the hotel management does care for every little things that a traveller may encouter.  Besides the afternoon tea offered in room as the welcome drink, the butler brought us some instant noddles for just in case we felt hungry at night after the musical. Mineral water and home homemake cake were offered by the receptionist whenever we went out for our day.  Postage of postcards were also offered on complimentary by the hotel.  What impressed me was provision of scissors, staples and adhesive tape were offered in room.  These are always useful…"
April 2013,Best service I've had in Europe,"Okay, wow. I used to work for Disney back when I was in college, so my standards for good service are high (Disney tends to be extremely picky about how employees treat their guests, and you have the basics of good service hammered into you over and over, or at least we did at the time). So, mostly, when I'm travelling in Europe, I am disappointed with the service I receive. But not at the Milestone. Oh, God, not at the Milestone!  By the time we left, my mother and I were laughing hysterically at how incredibly concerned everyone was that we had a good time. We were shown around the hotel by a man who was obviously proud of its many amenities. We were given a welcome to the Milestone handwritten letter on arrival in our room. We were given a box of tea, and later a bookmark,…"
April 2013,SImply Perfect,Spent Monday night at the Hotel celebrating my Anniversary. The staff are so friendly and helpful. The rooms are extremely comfortable and the food is fantastic. Even the room service at midnight was superb. Afternoon tea is superb. I would recommend this to anybody
April 2013,Amazing stay as normal,My family and I have stayed at this wonderful hotel opposite Kensington Palace and have  always enjoyed our stay.The staff are always very friendly and always willing to help.  We have stayed in many of the individually designed rooms and have always been very happy.  The breakfast is always very fresh and has a good selection. We have had afternoon tea in many of the hotels in London and the Milestone takes a lot of beating.
March 2013,Excellent Service on a Business Trip,"I had the pleasure of staying at The Milestone for two evenings while in London on business. When I arrived from the States, as promised, my room was ready for me to freshen up. I had an unplanned business breakfast the next morning and the service was professional and very accommodating. I was greeted by name each time I entered and exited and my room had a fantastic view of the park. The exercise room was clean and had all of the equipment one would expect. Overall I had a wonderful experience and would highly recommend the hotel for any traveler who values the boutique experience."
April 2013,A special treat,"My wife and i spent 5 days at this remarkable boutique hotel in March.The experience was so wonderful,that we decided to come back in October,bringing our daughter and son in law with us. We felt pumpered, accomodated,and being taken care of , in any form.Cozy,beautiful,elegant with an emphasis on details in every area and aspect.Well furnished rooms,modern bathooms and very comfortable beds.Well train personnel,eager to assist you,exceptional breakfast with remarkable service,and night time piano as you enjoy your tea.7 minutes away,from the train station,and right across the street from Hide Park.The area is full of different restaurants, and we discovered a little jewel 1-2 blocks away (Cote Bistro),very busy place.Well,i can't wait to return and feel once more like a…"
April 2013,Beautiful and Elegant Boutique hotel,"Wonderfully elegant boutique hotel, located directly across from Kennsington Palace. This hotel really has it all to offer. Fantastic service, indoor pool, fitness center, great food and the most beautiful/comfy rooms. The staff was extrememly attentive, kinda felt like royalty myself! Enjoyed their famous Afternoon tea. The tea was lovely and the food was amazing! I also tried, dinner and breakfast. All very good and tasty. Overall the staffs goal was to see that I was pleased with my stay the whole time I was there and they definitely achieved that. If you like smaller/boutique hotels rather then a larger 5 star hotels, this is the place to stay while in London. Great location to shopping, the Underground, museums and Kennsington Palace."
January 2013,Fabulous Hotel--Wonderful Service!,"My husband and I travel to Europe every year and we either fly into or out of London. We've stayed in quite a few nice hotels in London,but we must say that the Milestone is ""over the top""!  From the moment we walked in, everything was perfect---well not everything--the heat went out in our room the day before we left! But no problem! Stephanie, Alexa and Fran saw to it that we were moved to a beautiful suite for the time remaining. They packed up everything and placed it in the new room. We already had plans for dinner with friends that evening, but Stephanie insisted that we be treated to a beautiful appetizer tray and drinks in the bar beforehand! The  entire staff was most hospitable and welcoming. Jose made reservations for us at a restaurant that we wanted to try but had…"
April 2013,You will genuinely feel welcome here,"The two of us spent a wonderful New Years holiday here.  We gave the travel agent two requirements for a hotel for our four night stay in London--a proper bar and near a tube station.  While the tube stop was near, it was closed for maintenance over the holiday.  The bus stopped just down the block, so this was not an issue.  The bar and the bartenders were warm and funny! We enjoyed our nightcaps each evening.  While those were our only two requirements, we got everything we could have imagined in our stay.  We received an email in advance of our stay asking for our preferences on everything from our preferred drink on arrival--champagne and an English ale were poured while we checked in--to linen and music choices for the iPod!  Without exception, every employee seemed to…"
April 2013,Another wonderful stay,"There is a joy to returning to a smallish, service oriented hotel.  To be rememberd by those who were there the last time you were and within hours by the new additions brings a feeling fo being a person and not a number.Every wish is immediately met with- of course we can do that and then it is done."
October 2012,Milestone Exceeds Anyone's Expectations,"As a travel professional, I note every nuance of a hotel, from its service staff to ambiance to customer service. London is abundant with top-tier hotels but none of them rises as high as The Milestone does. I spent four nights/five days on this trip to London; I last stayed at The Milestone two years ago. Truly, I can't imagine ""improving"" this property. It's perfect. Located across the street from Kensington Palace and Gardens, The Milestone is in a non-touristy area. Close-by is a huge Whole Foods and an Underground station which also houses a large Marks & Spencer.  Staff goes out of its way to provide customized assistance .... the concierges went way beyond play tickets. They called sister properties and communicated with them to ensure we had tickets to the…"
April 2013,Fabulous Hotel!,"I've been remiss in not writing about my stay here.  Visited our daughter in London while enroute to Europe on business.  The Milestone, across from Hyde Park, was conveniently located to her quarters, making it a good choice based on location.  Little did we know the treat that we were in for. The room was large with a great view of the park and all the amenities one would expect from a great hotel.  It is the staff here, however, that help to distinguish this hotel from its competitors. We couldn't say enough about how friendly and helpful each and every staff member was.  I've stayed at a lot of great hotels in London, but this is clearly my favorite."
April 2013,Great place to stay,"We stayed at the Milestone recently to celebrate my husband's birthday.  We had been staying in a different area of London for 5 nights before staying at the milestone & had a very hectic week so were ready to relax & enjoy his birthday.  The decor is traditional & there are some lovely original features in the hotel. The service was excellent as was the food, the extra special touches & attention to detail is what makes this hotel a great place to stay.  Upon check in we were given an upgrade which was much appreciated & Fran showed us round the hotel.  He was extremely helpful, knowledgable & friendly as were all the staff. The room was lovely as was the bathroom with plenty of nice touches, the only thing that wasn't perfect was the picture on the TV but as we didn't really…"
December 2012,Beyond my expectations,"Everything about this stay (my third) was excellent, if I could have given a higher score than 10/10 for this weekend it would be thoroughly deserved. Special thanks to Pedro who showed us a lot of rooms (I loved the Safari Room) and also to Augustine who served us our evening meal and was really informative about everything. Also, must not forget Marcus, that man has a fantastic memory, remembered we didn't come back for a cocktail on our last stay, he made me a delicious Ameretto sour. All the staff are friendly and approachable which you do not get in the larger hotels. We even tried the resistance pool this time which was an experience. We had breakfast in our room and in the restaurant which was perfect and an evening meal. Hopefully be back sometime soon."
April 2013,Wonderful British style hotel,"This is my favourite hotel in London. Service is excellent, from reception to waiters, everyone extremely helpful with a smile on the face.  Decoration is old style British, very well taken care of and rooms are extremely comfortable.  Location is great by Hyde Park and Kensington, 5 min walk to the Royal Albert Hall and close to tube stations and buses.  Afternoon tea is amazing."
April 2013,The Best,"I was fortunate enough to spend one night in this fabulous hotel,  The staff, food, service and Afternoon Tea were exceptional.  The Kensington location is perfect for shopping and site seeing.  Can you give 6 stars?"
March 2013,My 4th stay and looking forward to a 5th,"Anyone that read my last review on this hotel may have noticed there were some blips in the service. Well everyone is entitled to some blips so my self and friend booked another stay as its such a beautiful hotel. Are we glad we did. on arrival we were shown to our room 509 which was lovely with views over the park. Everything was perfect they even had the pillows we requested on our last stay. Fruit platter and champagne welcome mmmm.  We had a cocktail in the bar which Markus made especially for us and canapes, both were excellent. We opted for breakfast in the room the first morning and had the smoked haddock with poached eggs, delicious.  After going out for a walk we asked Pedro who was front of house if he could show us some of the other rooms and everyone he showed us was…"
February 2013,5 STARS NOT ENOUGH!,"We recently spent three nights in London at the Milestone at the onset of a 2 week trip through England. We stayed in all top rated 5 star hotels and our favorite was the Milestone. They all had exceptional rooms and food, but the service and attention the Milestone gives to their customers was exceptional with none of the snobbishness other Hotels carried themselves with! They all called us by our names and correct title. They promptly arranged excellent massages for my wife & I after spending 13 hours getting there. Their dining experience was also exceptional, and reasonably priced. Best food we had in London. Location was terrific right across from Kennsington Palace & Gardens, and within walking distance of many top London sites including Harrods. If you want a 5 plus star…"
March 2013,My favourite Hotel in London,"I come to London every year on business and have found the Milestone Hotel to be by far the most welcoming and comfortable place to stay. The rooms are spotless and the staff make every effort to make you feel welcome. The hotel has individual air con in the room so one can get warm quickly if the weather is cold! The concierge team are extremely helpful and can almost always offer sound advice.Room service is prompt and the food choices are exceptional. I would recommend this hotel to any friend and especially for a lady travelling alone, because I feel that it is a safe and secure environment in which to stay."
February 2013,Simply brilliant!!,"We stayed at the Milestone, having been suggested to do so by a fellow Brit. It's an ideal location directly across from Kensington Palace, the nicest Whole Foods market, and many different fashion shops. Plus the Tube & the bus stops are so close by! All of these being important factors with 3 teenage girls!  We were on spring break visiting our eldest daughter who is studying abroad. Being a family of five, we stayed in one of their apartments with 2 bedrooms & 2-1/2 baths. It also had a kitchen, breakfast room and living room. The apartment included breakfast every morning downstairs in the beautiful restaurant with a fireplace. The food was delicious and the service impeccable!. We found the food over all excellent as we had high tea upon our arrival, as well as room service…"
April 2013,Six star service,"I've been meaning to write this review but have been so busy so finally here it is... I stayed at this hotel in February and what can I say a sanctuary in the heart of London.  The staff that I encountered were more than first class and I kept a note of all their names here goes, there was Georgia at reception with her bright and warm smile engaging, caring personality who couldn't do enough for me!!  Fran the butler with his funny Irish charm so helpful what a treat, a wonderful chap called  Fabrizo in the restaurant, gorgeous Steve at the door (got to hang on to this one) amazingly polite and engaging, lovely Silvie on the telephones whenever I didn't get through she would sort it out for me, I could go on Florent in the restaurant , Marcus at the bar was great. This was truly…"
March 2013,Excellent,My husband was on business and I tagged along.  Typically we stay at Brown's which is another boutique hotel.  I have to say this is a much better hotel.  The staff is friendly and efficient. The company itself really pays attention to detail. The food is good too. We stayed in the safari suite which was beautiful.  The weather wasn't great but it made coming back to the hotel better.
October 2012,My luxury home in London,I stayed here for my birthday with my family and it was a magical experience. As soon as we arrived our cases were brought in by the butler and we were greeted and went to reception. We checked in and the butler took us to our room. The room was spacious and luxurious with a balcony with a great view. It was my birthday and on arrival I had a cake waiting in my room and a card from the milestone staff wishing me happy birthday! The location was perfect near the centre however quiet in a picturesque location. The pool was a great refreshing finish to a long day in London however the hotel is so good you could stay in the hotel all week! We wanted to have afternoon tea however they were full to capacity but still managed to squeeze us in. The afternoon tea must be tried as it is…
March 2013,Most amazing hotel,"This is by far, the most amazing hotel i've ever stayed in.  I stayed in the Regency suite, which had nice views of the park. The bath in the middle of the room was a nice touch, as was the jar full of jelly beans. Penhaligons toiletries are used in the rooms and I'm now a huge fan of their products. Everything was perfect. I cant recommend it enough. Very good location in High street Kensington and excellent service."
March 2013,Absolutely wonderful stay!,"The Milestone will without a doubt rank in the top five hotels I have had the pleasure of staying with.  My wife and I stayed for 9 nights and each of them was a above our expectations.  We were visiting our adult daughter in London and the hotel was very accommodating in allowing us to have her over night with us several nights.  Of course there was an extra fee, but it included a very nice hot or continental breakfast.  We also had the pleasure of having our very first English tea!  The hotel presents an excellent tea experience.  We opted for the champagne tea and was very impressed!  The presentation and service were impeccable and the food items were excellent! The tea was of course awesome!  The bar areas were very nice as well. A nice place to sip a local ale.  The…"
March 2013,A wonderful hotel and restaurant,"It was my birthday and my family took us for a Champagne High Tea at this absolutely lovely hotel.  The Staff were charming and impeccable and the service was fautless,  Little wonder that it rates as a Member of the Leading Small Hotels of the World!!  The dining room looked really wonderful, although we did not have dinner there ourselves (had far too much to eat at tea time!) Elegance like this does not come cheap, but an excellent choice for a very special occasion."
March 2013,Hotel Perfection!,"If you are looking for the most beautiful, accommodating, special, romantic, and charming hotel in London - please look no further than the Milestone. My husband and I visited for a vacation for 3 nights and were absolutely blown away by every detail. We've stayed in many 5 star resort properties, and the Milestone has now raised the bar.   First, the staff. From the moment we arrived, the staff went ABOVE & BEYOND to do everything imaginable to make our stay 5 stars. We were greeted by name from the moment we stepped out of the taxi...like magic! We were greeted by our butler after check-in and every single staff member greeted us by name as we toured the hotel's charming facilities. Our room, the Viscount Suite, was huge! With views of Kensington Palace, a huge comfy bed, and…"
March 2013,My Thesaurus is inadequate,"Truly, one can hardly find enough superlatives to describe the experience of a stay at The Milestone.  We are no strangers to hotels in the Red Carnation Group, but we particularly enjoyed our first stay here in March.  The staff, without exception, were extremely attentive, without being over-solicitous; and it is hard to find fault with the welcome, the radical cleanliness, comfort or the cuisine. The quality of the food was of a very high standard.  The only fault we could find...and we are being a bit pedantic.... was that the early morning tea was only lukewarm.  I suspect it was made with water off the boil, as so often dismally practised on the Continent. We were particularly taken with the attention to detail throughout, including the thoughtful individual books and…"
March 2013,A stylish home from home,"As a writer, I've been lucky enough to travel the world and stay at some of the best hotels - and the worst. This isn't just one of the best. I've actually come to the conclusion that the Milestone is THE best. A happy, welcoming staff combined with beautiful decor make this a peaceful and stylish retreat from London's hussle and bussle. It actually feels like home, only a little more luxurious."
February 2013,Faultless service from start to finish,"This was a specially arranged overnight stay (with dinner) for a birthday treat.  From the moment we walked through the door, we were made to feel special.  The service was impeccable. In the rooms, the hotel has thought of everything that their guests might need and more. Dinner at Cheneston's, the hotel's restaurant, was a delight as was breakfast the following morning. Having worked in the travel industry for over 20 years, I can honestly say that no hotel in this country has come close to delivering the service that we received at The Milestone Hotel. Thank you."
January 2013,Discrete luxury - Totally spoilt in London,"We were fortunate to stay at the Milestone, and had the most amazing experience.  Even before you cross the threshold, the guest preference form, you are invited to complete, means the hotel already know what you like, from a welcome drink, champagne naturally!! to the bedding you like, tea and coffee in the room, etc.  Amazing choice, and you then have everything tailored to your exact requirements when you check in.  The rooms are very individual, and ours had a view over Kensington Gardens, very picturesque.  The bathrooms too, are lovely and spacious, with a Penhaligan amenities, that are generously topped up. There is a lovely lounge, with when we were there, a welcoming open fire, very needed, as it was a cold weekend, and there is the Stables bar, and the conservatory,…"
January 2013,Above and beyond,"Although an expensive hotel, felt like they made it worth every penny!  We had a great room with a garden view, and a few special requests such as flowers for the lady were no issue to arrange.  I especially enjoyed making use of the various facilities within the hotel, with the various dining rooms, bars, and sitting rooms each very unique."
February 2013,Great Hotel in London,"We had the pleasure of staying at The Milestone Hotel for more than one week during January 2013. The service at The Milestone is incredible.  The outstanding staff goes out of their way to make sure that you are comfortable and enjoying your stay.  The food is delicious . The Milestone tea is something everyone should experience.  The hotel is ideally situated for sightseeing and just wandering the beautiful streets of Kensington. It is convenient to tube stations and major bus routes. We needed a hotel that would allow our dog to stay.  The Milestone Hotel loves dogs and provided us with dog bedding, blanket, bowls and even a dog menu.  We will definitely stay there again."
February 2013,One of London's Finest Boutique Hotels,"We stayed at the Milestone for 2 nights and it provided us with the perfect location from which to enjoy the city of London.  Hotel is ideally situated right next to Kensington Palace and Gardens, and right over the road from Hyde Park.  Within easy walking distance of Harrods, Kensington High Street and Royal Albert Hall.   As an old historical landmark, the Hotel itself has been impeccably restored and with exceptional interior design and artwork, provides a very warm and intimate feel in each and every area. Elegance and comfort in every sense.... Plenty of personal touches and the attention to detail is incredible.  Rooms were a little small, but this is London so can be expected.  Many refined and personal touches in the room, so while a little small, there was nothing else…"
August 2012,Outstanding staff,"I had the pleasure of staying in yet another one lf the red caranatiln hotels.  Beutiful, warm extremely well thought through and executed concept.....i must add that i am most impressed by the fact that no matter which hotel in the group i have stayed the service, attention and passion to make me as a guest feel like i am the most important person in the house is by far the reson why i will allways smile when making a booking. Well done."
August 2012,Heaven During Olympics,"We booked 2 rooms for our week long stay during August 2012 for Olympics (adjoining: kids (4yrs and 7yrs) and us).  Both rooms’ decor was elegant, functional and comfortable.  The services provided by all were impeccable from arrival through leaving (sadly).  I was initially concerned the kids would not find any restaurant menu items they liked, but they offered a wide variety of breakfast and dinner menu items that easily met my kids needs (pancakes, french toast, etc.).  Note, the restaurant menu was fantastic. The bath amenities were excellent and my wife pleasantly remarked about the power of the hair dryers (most hotels offer weak hair dryers).  Overall, excellent!!! Cannot wait to say again, but without kids next time."
December 2012,Family Friendly,Such a great place to stay with family during a trip. I stayed there 3 days and 4 nights with my wife and enjoyed a lot. I would love to come back with my kids.   Supportive staff and excellent service.
February 2013,wonderful few days,"When my aunt and i decided to spend a few days in London, we chose The Milestone, which was the best decision ever! A welcoming hotel full of individuality. Both our rooms were decorated so differently , I almost thought, 'Mr Gray' might pop in!!!!! No really, comfortable personal and special. The staff went out of their way to make sure our every need was met and every request made was fulfilled with a smile! So close to all the areas we needed to be in and so walking was a pleasure Thank you Milestone"
January 2013,Amazing 5 star boutique Hotel in London,"We are returning guests to the Milestone Hotel, and from the minute we arrived to the moment we left we were delighted with this quite extraordinary hotel. This is a truly  5 star boutique hotel which we would love to stay at  in each city we travel to.  Although, we arrived early in the morning, our room was ready and we were offered  a lovely breakfast upon arrival.   Our room was amazing, cosy, luxurious, sophisticated  with a rare and special feeling of being at home, a warm welcome note, and complimentary wifi that we do appreciate.  We used the room service often, and the quality of the food, the kindness of the staff , the presentation and the choice were exceptional. We also had the Milestone's afternoon tea, which is in our opinion, the best in London, and certainly not…"
February 2013,the height of elegance yet cozy,"I chose this hotel for a four night stay because of the highly laudatory reviews, presitigious awards, etc.  I am partial to small hotels for their friendly ambiance.  My high expectations of the hotel were, if anything, exceeded by our experience there.  They practice customer service as an art.  Staff is attentive, warm and helpful in every way.  The concierge service secured last minute tickets for us to a hilarious play and arranged to send home our winter cothes as we were in transit to a 3 week stay in India.  They actually did a print out of the NY Times for us!  We felt pampered; it was a great way to start our trip.    The public spaces in the hotel are on the small side which gives a feeling of coziness.  Very fine breakfast offered, lovely English tea in one of the…"
December 2012,Superb Hotel,"We had a superb stay at The Milestone,all the staff were friendly and our room was stunning.A must for anyone staying in London.The location of the hotel is excellent. A welcome glass of champagne on arrival kicked off a wonderful weekend for us, a shame we had to leave. Will definitely go back when in London as our first choice."
November 2012,amazing,The location of the hotel is excellent. The staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful. Our room was amazing. A great big comfy bed. The hotel bar is a fantastic place.Stay at this fabulous hotel.The dining room was elegant and the breakfast was great.
January 2013,Great location,"Had a very pleasant long weekend at this hotel.The staff are exceptionally friendly and most helpful.Our room was nicely furnished as were the public areas.The location of the hotel is excellent -right on the edge of Kensington Park and the Albert Hall,V&A and Knightsbridge are all within walking distance."
January 2013,Always amazing,"We totally love staying here. Every time is as great as the last.  We were met with a very warm welcome and glass of bubbly. Our room was amazing, on two levels with a great big comfy bed.    We did not eat dinner I the hotel but did have room service at around 11pm. The food was lovely.  We had breakfast, there was a large choice, all fresh and tasty.  We were sad to only be staying one night this time but we will be back, there is nowhere better in London."
May 2012,Brilliant!!!,"Upon checking in this perfectly British ""boutique"" hotel we were treated like royalty. The entire staff at the hotel were amazing and extremely hospitable.  The hotel bar is a fantastic place to have a cocktail prior to venturing out for the evening and when we returned our bartender welcomed us back by our names. This bar was a fantastic place to relax and talk with friends.  The dining room was elegant and the breakfast was superb. Although I did not opt for the healthier options - the waffle was a slice of heaven - a little bit like dessert for breakfast.  The room was perfect and the artwork on the wall was superb.  After forgetting to take off the do not disturb sign - so housekeeping did not clean our room while we were gone - we were greeted with a note that stated…"
January 2013,Great experience at Milestone Hotel!,"My wife and I stayed at the Milestone hotel for my 30th birthday.  From the moment we checked in until our departure the next afternoon, we were overwhelmed by the superb service from the staff at the hotel.    Upon check in, two managers welcomed me, wished me a happy birthday and upgraded our room from a standard category to one of their themed suites free of charge.  The decor in the room was a bit flamboyant but tastefully done - it was an homage to the late French entertainer Mistinguett who was once the highest paid actress/singer in her days.  The doorman at the hotel told me he wished he had tickets for the concert as well - since he was a big fan of Mark Knopfler also.  Nonetheless he wished me a great evening and asked me all about it on my return after the concert had…"
January 2013,It's the people who make it special,"My wife and I stay at the Milestone whenever we're in London. Having stayed at ""cheaper"" hotels in the Kensington area, we would walk by the Milestone and we'd always talk about ""someday, we're going to stay there.""  We finally did and never looked back.  The location of the hotel is perfect, close to restaurants of every type and price, just a couple of blocks from the High Street Kensington tube station, with shopping that ranges from food shops, higher-end chains to unique boutiques and antique shops.  The staff at the Milestone are the secret to its perfection, always searching for ways to improve their service. Yes, it's a most charming, intimate hotel, very quiet, warm and inviting. The hotel offers rooms you won't find elsewhere in London, each unique, beautiful,…"
February 2012,Favorite Hotel,The charm of the building is complemented by the competence and courtesy of the staff.  We spent a week that was both enjoyable and provied many opportunities for appreciating the best of British hospitality.
September 2012,Luxury at it's best,"I stayed at The Milestone Hotel just for one night. And i was very impressed. I have been working in luxury hotels for many years and generally know what to expect, but The Milestone Hotel absolutely exceeded my expectations.  First just when you walk in to the hotel, it seems you have entered a peaceful oasis, it was the first wow factor. It does not feel At all that the hotel is located on one of the busiest west London streets! I like small, intimate boutique hotels and Milestone thicks all boxes. I stayed in one of the studio suites with a stunning view over Kensington Gardens! Room was beautifully decorated, i especially liked the bathroom. It was good size and absolute luxury.  All in all can' t say enough about this amazing hotel they deserve to be Nr.1 on Tripadvisor!"
January 2013,The Milestone is doing everything right,"I was delighted to see The Milestone's recent inclusion in Tripadvisor's top 25 hotels in the world. From our experience, this beautiful boutique hotel deserves all the accolades it is getting. My husband and I, and two small dogs, stayed at the Milestone in September during our relocation to London. We were charmed from the outset, and every aspect of the hotel -- the cozy, comfortable bar, the gracious reception and dining rooms, the attentive service, and signature room details, only enhanced our sense of being ""home.""  Since then, we've stayed at two other Red Carnation properties, the Summer Lodge, and the Old Government House on Guernsey: both are superb.  Not many hotels make you feel this at ease, and eager to return, as the Milestone does."
January 2013,Wonderfully helpful,"Having got married last week my new husband and I went for a few days to the MIlestone, having chosen it because of reviews we had read here. I have to say we were not let down in any way and loved everything about the hotel. Unfortunately however I had started feeling ill on the journey and then began feeling worse and after two nights we had no option but to leave and come home. The hotel were extremely understanding and helpful and I was only sorry we were not able to complete the honeymoon in the way we expected. Obviously this was hugely disappointing.  I would love to go back again - the location is perfect, every member of staff is wonderful and there is nothing I can fault. Previous comments about the size of rooms did not apply to ours - we had ample space and storage,…"
December 2012,What a fantastic hotel with excellent service from fantastic staff.,"I am writing this review having just returned from a birthday celebration weekend that was made SO special by the staff at the hotel. This is definitely a 5 star hotel with 5 Star service. Concierge Joshua and the lovely Da were only too happy to help but not over powering, everything was pitched at the right level. I would recommend this hotel to anyone for any occasion. The location was ideal walking distance to Harrods and plenty of lovely places to eat close by.  If you are thinking about going to London and want some luxury then this hotel is highly recommended.  Thank you to all at the Milestone ;;))"
February 2012,"Top service, friendly staff, great location","At the Milestone you certainly get what you pay for.  This was a one off for my partner and myself (new years eve) as I don't typically make a habit of staying in 5 star hotels, but it's the type of place you wish you could always afford to stay when you need/want a hotel. If you took advantage of every little thing they offer you, you'd begin to wonder how other hotels get away with doing so little for their guests.  It's very cosy and richly decorated (as the building itself dates back to the 1600's) which I think beats any ""modern"" establishment hands down, for warmth, character and charm.  The staff have excellent initiative, are very friendly and always ready to help. They upgraded my room when I checked in which was very pleasant surprise. The room itself was great, very…"
November 2012,Fantastic!,Stayed here over the Thanksgioving weekend in 2011 and enjoyd every aspect of the experience.  The bar downstairs is a particular highlight for pre and post dinner drinks with a great bar staff and plenty of interesting nooks and cranies to hang out in.  Great location for most London based activities without being in the mist of the downtown bustle.  We will return the next time I visit.
October 2012,Once in a lifetime,"My husband and I and a friend stayed for 10 days in a two bedroom apartment at The Milestone in November/December.   We enjoy the 'good things in life', but this far surpassed that. From the wonderful driver who picked us up at the airport, the several pleasant and friendly doormen, the happy and cheerful concierges, to Fran, the butler, who gave new meaning to the well deserved word 'awesome',  an overused word which I would normally try to avoid at all costs - they made our stay a memorable one which probably won't be repeated again soon.     The apartment was resplendent with beautiful furniture, opulent draperies and bedding, beautiful bath amenities, well appointed kitchen - well, I could go on and on.   Coming home in the evenings after a full day of enjoying London,  the…"
December 2012,Great place to stay with family,"Great place to visit over weekend break. Nice relaxing place, great comfortable rooms and friendly staff. Children were very happy and feel that they are very welcome by staff  who was very friendly and accomodated. Enjoyed! thank you"
December 2012,Wonderful Christmas,"Stayed in one of the apartments over Christmas and also enjoyed lovely breakfasts each morning, the Christmas dinner, and a tea.  All were wonderful!  Our family loved the space and convenience, plus it was only 5 minutes walk to the Tube and Whole foods.  Many nice restaurants in walking distance, and the staff was superb at giving suggestions on where to go and eat.  We avoid the tourist traps at all costs.    Our apartment was so clean and comfortable, and the beds felt so good after a day of sightseeing. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone."
February 2013,"""Out of This World Experience""","We stayed at the Milestone in London for only one night in February before flying out on holiday the next day.  We have never stayed in a 5 Star Boutique Hotel before but what a magnificent experience it was.  Accomodation - amazing, staff - amazing, warmth & friendlyness - amazing!  For sheer luxury and comfort this has to be one of the best Hotels anywhere.  We cannot praise the staff enough for the way that they looked after us especially on the eve of our holiday abroad. Thank you Milestone and I'm sure we shall return, soon!  (If anyone is interested in staying then please contact the lovely Georgia at the hotel)."
October 2012,excellent service,"This beautiful hotel in Kensington is a part of the Red Carnation family of fine hotels. The standards of the rooms are excellent; clean, well presented and comfortable. The staff are very friendly and professional."
March 2013,Best hotel,"Difficult to express the many components that go into excellent service.  The Milestone seems to encompass all of them - kind, knowledgeable, friendly, helpful staff; exceedingly good wine; very fine food; spotlessly clean and very well appointed rooms. We hope to return soon.  It is hard to imagine better service any place.  The Ritz could take a lesson.  This beautiful hotel in Kensington is a part of the Red Carnation family of fine hotels.  We will now attempt to find them wherever we go.  We feel indebted to the staff at the Milestone for making our week so lovely. Gail Hornsby"
March 2013,The Milestone experience,"We recently renewed our acquaintance with the Milestone and were delighted to see that it was every bit as good as we remembered.  The standards of the rooms are excellent - clean, well presented and comfortable.  The staff are very friendly and professional.  Our dining experience was good, and the ambiance of the dining room and the other public rooms is good.  We will certainly want to repeat our experience when we can."
March 2013,Best find ever!!!,The Milestone Hotel on Kensington High Street was the best find ever thanks to our usual hotel being fully booked!!!  We were more than impressed by the attention to every finer detail you can imagine!  From the friendly doorman offering to park our car when we arrived to the attentive barman late at night!  We went for an early morning run in Hyde Park and returned to the same friendly doorman who was waiting for us with a bottle of water each!  Delightful staff and a 10++ experience all the way!
February 2013,Perfect,"Just spent four nights at the Milestone, and was very impressed. I was there for a business meeting. The staff is really friendly and professional. Such a great choice and family friendly hotel. I'd love to say its one of the perfect hotel."
February 2013,Our own Downton,"We just spent four nights at the Milestone, and were very impressed. It's a charming old place, with excellent, engaging service, and warm, inviting common rooms. We haunted the bar. Coming back each evening really was like coming back to our own personal Downton Abbey. We've been long-time fans of a sister property, the Egerton House Hotel, in Knightsbridge, and decided to try another place just for the heck of it. Egerton, we love you--but, we love the Milestone too!"
February 2013,amazingly british!,absolutely amazing small hotel with the finest amenities and personalized attention.  morning breakfast was delishious and the bar is small and quaint with great little bites.  afternoon tea is fabulous with a live piano player.  make tea even better by ordering a bottle of champagne.  the scones were so good i ordered some to take on the plane back to the states.  highly highly recommend if you want an amazing experience while enjoying the fabulous city of london.
February 2013,The Best Hotel,"I stayed at this lovely hotel recently for the 4th time and it just gets better and better. You really cant fault it at all. The staff are really friendly and remember you. Everyone tries really hard to make sure they deliver whatever you need. It is a lovely personal hotel and you are treated not just as a number but as a person. The food is excellent too.  The rooms are really spacious and if you can stretch to a junior suite, they are just amazing.  I normally stay at the Savoy but this is better. Elaine from Dorset"
June 2012,The Milestone a hotel of charm,"I have stayed at the milestone before and the first time it was cosy and cute. My first room was a savile row design which was awesome! Different! Yet not too loud, this time we stayed at the Venetian suite and it was jut an absolute charm in Kensington.  To be honest I had different options of hotels but I wanted to stay here because the location is brilliant, it's a boutique hotel therefore you get treated like its your own home and this what I exactly wanted.  Anyway the stay was lovely, charming and nice, staff were responsive and attainable ( thank you ) What the hotel gives you is love and what it needs is a new kettle, probably a new iron and coffee+tea in the room."
November 2012,Best Night in London,"My husband and I still fondly recall our stay at The Milestone Hotel.  Our first couple of nights in the UK were spent at this lovely location and we couldn't have been happier.  It was wonderful to return every night to such a comfortable, welcoming place.  Staff members were superb.  We stayed in several other hotels during our travels and this hotel had the most genuinely amiable, efficient and knowledgeable staff.  The Milestone has excellent dining options, is located in a pleasant part of London - right across from Kensington Park, and our rooms were cozy, elegant and very well appointed.  In fact, we were so impressed with the hotel that we decided to stay there the last couple of days of our vacation.  If you would like a gracious and truly memorable stay in London I…"
October 2012,Absolutely wonderful (with just a few minor complaints),"The Milestone Hotel was a wonderful experience - beautifully decorated rooms with incredibly professional staff that tried to go the extra mile to make our experience special. The hotel was fairly conveniently located in High Kensington, and also fairly affordable (after discounts). I would definitely recommend this hotel for special occasions, as they definitely made ours more memorable.  +++: Service:  From the moment you check-in, the entire experience was exactly as many guests have previously espoused: incredible. From champagne and cake for the birthday celebration, to canapés in the evening, all staff were friendly, professional and helpful. The concierge was especially helpful with reservations and recommendations, and the doorman was delightfully cheery as always.  …"
February 2012,blissful landing,"I stayed at the Milestone in October 2012 for one night, after arriving on an overnight flight from Canada.  It is an easy journey by tube from Heathrow and a short walk from the Kensington station.  Upon arrival, I was greeted warmly by the entire staff, sat upon a couch in the lovely parlor, and served a coffee while I waited (briefly) for my room to be readied.  Touches such as this one followed:  little gifts in the room (prunes and chocolate), a delightful breakfast, uses of the hotel's sitting rooms and atrium, etc.  Since the hotel is directly across the street from Kensington Gardens, I could walk off the jet lag easily.  It was absolutely perfect."
November 2012,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here a couple of years ago for a few days.It was a lovely hotel,nice and small and friendly. Very expensive though.It was in a nice spot near the park.the service could not be faulted,but the room was very small with not a good outlook."
January 2013,Lovely British and top class in all performance.,The Milestone has  no tolerance making  ANY errors. They have excellent service and very friendly reception. Food and wine together with breakfast and don't forget the bar - high class! But nothing compared with the beds!! You will never get out of it lit's a lovely sleeping!
November 2012,Wonderful Experience,"The Milestone is the perfect blend of old English atmosphere with the modern amenities. The staff makes you  experience truly great service. Visited the promenade for afternoon tea, which was a real treat. The best afternoon tea ever. If your looking for 100% service then this is the place. Luxurious furnishings and attentive staff make a weekend stay feel unforgettable.  The rooms are so comfortable and the hotel smells of fresh flowers with the hint of polished wood."
January 2013,Great Hotel except the restaurant,"The Milestone Hotel is a little gem in Kensington, service is warm and personal, public areas are full of character and charm (specially the polo bar and the afternoon tea living room); and rooms are adequate.  Location is great right on Kensington Court and in front of kensington palace and gardens.  Our stay was full of nice little details from the staff, they make you feel at home and tend to your every need with a smile. would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants great attention to detail.  My only complaint is the service at the restaurant, for breakfast we had a couple of bad experiences with extremely slow service as well as the waiters giving tables to other guests that had come in after we were already waiting for a table of the same size. We finally gave up and…"
December 2012,Another wonderful stay,"Yet another wonderful stay at one of the Red Carnation hotels. This time it was at the Milestone in Kensington. The staff went above and beyond their remit making our stay wonderful. The dinner in the restaurant was fantastic taken from the owners recipe book, what a meal again the staff were outstanding. The room overlooked Kensington Palace it was perfect and had everything any guest could possibly need. We would go there again tomorrow"
December 2012,Great place to spend the festive season,"We stayed in one of the lovely apartments which are incorporated as part of the hotel -- with access to all the hotel's amenities plus a full kitchen.  It's a lively location, festively decorated with the best Christmas decor in all of London (IMHO) and with an extremely warm and hospitable staff.  Our second season here and we look forward to visiting annually."
January 2013,Luxury Steps from Gardens,"Really Outstanding hotel by all means ; extremely friendly staff, pretty decoration, well designed rooms, feels home with luxury  And the location is sepurb, one can just step out of the hotel to kinsington gardens"
December 2012,Hard to fault for a half day business training event; attentive and anticipative staff.  Great facilities.  Great coffee,"I have just visited The Milestone Hotel for a short training course.  Having run many such events in other London hotels, my experience has been that there have often been problems with intrusive noise, inconsistent service levels, rooms with difficult climate control, and all too frequently dreadful coffee.  Often with no natural light.  From the moment I arrived (once I had located the entrance which is in Kensington Road not Kensington Court), staff were immediately, friendly, helpful and anticipative.  The room was very quiet and we were not disturbed at all during our session.  We were able to get the room at just the right temperature for everyone. The coffee was freshly made and full of taste.  Overall, hard to fault."
December 2012,Great Small hotel in London,My wife and I had occasion to spend two nights in London on a trip to visit friends in the UK. The hotel is a little pricy by world standards but not in London. Service was great and the staff could not do enough to assure our visit was pleasant. If you stay impress you friends by using the Bentley.
December 2012,Christmas in London,"We arrived Christmas eve in London and stayed at The Milestone again this year. I stayed with my daughter, December last year on a shopping trip. This year we all stayed, My husband and other daughter. We had all week planned. Afternoon tea at The Savoy, Skating at Somerset House, Winter wonderland in Hyde park.  Go to see Skyfall. Thriller the Michael Jackson experience at the theatre. Ronnie Scotts and of course shopping! Also had afternoon tea at the hotel which was really lovely. The hotel was really Christmasey and looked beautiful inside and outside.  Staff were brilliant as aways.  Ended or started the evening in the jockey bar with a champagne or a cocktail, divine! We love shopping but the boxing day sales were a bit hardcore for us. Hotel even took us to Victoria…"
December 2012,'Unforgettable stay in London',"I was lucky enough to stay at The MIlestone a couple of weeks ago with my mum and her friend and I can honestly say it was perfect from start to finish. Such a beautiful and luxurious boutique hotel, yet refined, cosy and unpretentious. The staff were a credit to the hotel, particularly the ladies on reception and the barmen at Stables Bar. Hope to return again soon!"
November 2012,High standards...with some blips,"The hotel were very keen guests should post a review onto Tripadvisor, so here goes. At this hotel level (that see themselves as the epitome of luxury, and for which one pays accordingly) it's attention to detail that its the ultimate judge of quality.More on this later. The style is very much 'country house' with lots of dark colours, wood panelling, chintz and so on. The rooms are on the small side (two guests wanting to watch TV means one will have to sit on the bed) but are richly furnished; the bathroom is substantial and luxuriously equipped. The lobby service is very good and attentive but I have one or two minor issues with the service. As I said, it's attention to detail that's all important. It seemed the majority of the staff serving were eastern European origin and…"
January 2012,Excellent Stay in London,"I spent a few nights at the Milestone Hotel in London, and I can say enough about the service, the style of the hotel, the convenience to getting around, and the friendly staff.  The breakfast was excellent, and the lovely parlor room with the roaring fire was so nice.  Every detail is complete in their rooms and the service that you receive.   In addition, they have a really cool resistance pool - it's a great way to exercise and unwind at the end of the day."
December 2012,Excellent stay!,"We stayed at The Milestone Hotel in December and our stay there was absolutely brilliant! During this stay, I asked my girlfriend to marry me. In the preparation for this occasion, I've probably exchanged over 20 e-mails with the hotel to make sure everything would be perfectly in order. They promised it would be excellent, and boy, did they deliver!  We booked the Mistinguett suite for two nights. Upon arrival, we were met by our butler who showed us around the hotel and the suite. 2 glasses of Champagne immediately appeared for us to enjoy.  I had made some specific requirements for the special occasion, and it seemed the entire hotel staff was into the plan. Even the ladies at the reception were very enthusiastic and when asking them a question (without my girlfriend nearby),…"
December 2012,A Wonderful Hotel,"We were a family group of ten, so not the easiest crowd to control; they managed us to perfection.  We stayed only one night but left feeling that we were parting from good friends, such was the kindliness of the staff.  Our room - probably one of the lowlier ones in the hotel - was exquisite.  We were treated like royalty, notwithstanding the numerous problems we dumped on them to resolve.  I suspect we will all be going back - in groups and en bloc - as soon as we have half an excuse to do so.  What a lovely place to stay!"
December 2012,UTOPIA,"Wonderful staff and location.  Everyone was so accomodating and friendly making the whole experience fabulous!  I will definitely return!  The facilities for accompanying pets are worth a browse too!!  The room was very comfortable with everything catered for -  luxury products and many extras.  If you are having the afternoon tea do not eat lunch beforehand!!  It is a marathon of delicious sandwiches, cakes and a cream tea!"
October 2012,Excellent hotel in London,"This small hotel is only a 10 minute walk from the Albert Hall.  All the staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble. The small restaurant serves excellent food, there is a lovely cosy lounge with a fire.  Bedrooms are fairly small but beautifully appointed.  I would definitely recommend a stay here."
November 2012,Great location,"I stayed at this hotel when I got stuck in London due to Hurricane Sandy in NYC.  It was a cute charming hotel.  It is right across the street from Hyde Park and I had a great view of it from my room.  It is also walking distance to Kensington Palace and Kensington High Street.  There is some food shopping just down the way and a Whole Foods, the first I have ever seen in London.  The room was nice.  I liked that the remote control for the tv was wrapped in plastic stating that it had been sterilized.  If only all hotels did that.  The afternoon tea was wonderful, but you need more than one person for it.  Most of the staff was friendly.  One of the concierge was not happy when I wanted to book a cab through Addison Lee.  He got very frustrated when trying to book and it showed.…"
December 2012,Best services ever!,"We stayed here for 3 nights for our honeymoon and were given the best services we have ever received out of all the hotels we have stayed around the world.  Everyone was extremely considerate, involving and warm, while upholding traditional English courtesy and respect. We felt very welcome and had received daily small gifts every time we returned to the hotel.  We are usually rather pedantic however felt overwhelmed by the true English hospitality offered by the truly wonderful staff of Milestone Hotel, London. We never stay at the Same hotel twice but would return to Milestone for our next London trip. You have surpassed our expectation in almost every way!   A big thanks to:  Teddy the bellboy,  Stephanie, Georgia in reception Fran the butler  Alex the concierge Grant the F&B…"
September 2012,Always 'home from home',"I stayed at The Milestone again last week, Christmas shopping with my niece. After a sumptuous lunch in their cosy lounge we headed for the shops.  When we got back it was champagne all the way!  Neil was, as ever, so welcoming. The new F&B Manager, Fabrizio, is a credit to the hotel.  Dinner in the evening was again out of this world.  The scallops to start were exceptionally well presented and tasty. My Venison with was pink, tender and perfect. My niece had the Kensington Pasty, WOW! who thought a 'pasty' could be this good (yes, I sneaked a taste).  I never tire of The Milestone and will be back in the New Year with my Mother. Can't wait!"
August 2012,You can't do better!!,"From the first moment we were met at the door to the Milestone we were blown away by the truly real level of concern, support and warmth of the entire staff of the Milestone.  The Sr Concierge Jose is a magic man, he knows all the best spots and his experience made this part of our vacation more than special!  An example of the commitment to the client that Milestone represents is that when we were unable to attend a West End theater at the VERY last minute due to illness, Jose was able to obtain a refund (minus admin charge).  OUTSTANDING is all we can say, for the whole Milestone team!!!  While not the cheapest hotel in London, if you want a 5 star personal experience you can't do better than the Milestone and it's team."
September 2012,Everything was perfect!,"The hotel location is very remarkable and close to Oxford St. The staff starting from concierge to reception are friendly and welling to help. They recieve you with a smile and they let to you feel you are @ home. The room well decorated with modern interior design, the room amenities are good. Wifi is free all the time and they have a nice lobby. I liked the Gym and spa facility. I would highly recommend this hotel to whose looking for luxury stay in London with money value. I will visit this hotel again and again"
September 2012,A gem.,"A gem of a hotel, well situated opposite Hyde Park.  The service was very attentive and friendly from the time we entered the hotel, dining was excellent with a very helpful sommelier...the team work between the Maitre d' and the sommelier and the waiting staff was just like a smooth running Swiss watch..  Freshly and tastefully decorated...Queen sized bed...I had asked for a king sized...perhaps unavailable...our room was "" snug"" but comfortable...we travel with a number of bags...there were no drawers...we stayed at another hotel previously in the UK...again no drawers to place one's clothes in...an UK phenomenon?"
September 2012,Wonderful experience,"After carefully choosing among the better hotels in London, we selected The Milestone.  Our choice couldn't have been better. Me and my partner have being staying at various luxury hotels over the years and this was a most satisfying experience. What distinguish The Milestone from other hotels is its staff. Friendly, warm, welcoming, polite, service minded and with a glimpse of humor.  Breakfast was not included in our price, and it wasn't cheep, but on the other hand the service was excellent and the ambiance superb. We had dinner in the restaurant one night, and it turned out to be one of the best dinners of the entire trip. Big thanks to Farbrizio Russo, Food and Beverage Manager and to Lia Poveda who is Head Sommelier for making our dinner so memorable. Markus Rottensteiner…"
September 2012,Gracious and friendly,"The Milestone Hotel is quintessentially English, with beautiful rooms and public areas honouring the best of British style and a warm welcome from staff making us feel like honoured guests.  Breakfasts were superb, as were thoughtful touches such as fresh fruit and house-made cookies in our room.  Attention to detail was evident in every aspect of our stay, which was perfect in all respects."
September 2012,Love this hotel!,"We are currently relaxing in our beautiful room at the Milestone and I felt compelled to write a review right away before I forget all the elemets that have wowed us since our arrival this afternoon!  First we were greeted with very warm welcomes from the staff, then we were given a tour of the hotel by the Butler, Pedro. Next we were treatedto complimentary drinks from the bar.  As if that wasn't enough, beautiful little gifts awaited us in our room...a perfume scented sachet for my smelly luggage, a tray of fresh fruit, a ribboned package of dried dates..etc.  On the television apersonnalized welcome message was displayed!  Later themaid left a flower vase with a note asking if we preferedher not touching our personal items when cleaning!  Tonight another little gift left…"
September 2012,Authentic elegance and comfort,"Dear Mr. Pike, My partner and I recently stayed at your hotel to celebrate her 50th birthday.  I simply can't thank you and your staff for making her birthday truly memorable.  We appreciated the room upgrade to the Venetian Suite and the thoughtful touches from canapes in the evening, to the birthday morning breakfast.  But most importantly, as has been the hallmark of your hotel, was the thoughtful service...not imposing or overbearing, but simply hospitable and considerate. We both travel internationally for business and have experienced the grandeur of the Raffles in Singapore, to the flamboyance of the One and Only Royal Mirage in Dubai, to what is considered the gold standard of service at the Mandarin Oriental in Bangkok, but for my partner's birthday we wanted to…"
September 2012,Our new favorite hotel in London,"What an incredible experience.  The staff was phenomenal in anticipating our every need, the room was great with everything ... Including 2 summer and winter robes, fresh fruit and a welcome note from the manager...the bar was beautiful with hand-crafted cocktails and the restaurant was superb with great food and over the top attentive service."
September 2012,once you have tried this hotel you will never go anywhere else in London.,We have just arrived home from a five day stay in the Milestone. From the time you arrive to the time they put you in the taxi and say goodbye the service is excellent.. All of the teams go out of their way to make sure your stay is perfect. They called us by our name at all times greeting us in the morning and on return to the hotel. We were recommended The Churchill pub a short walk away and one of the staff showed me a picture of the pub he had taken on his phone of it that morning!! Having stayed at this hotel we will never go anywhere else in London. This hotel is five star in everything it does. Well done to the whole team.
November 2012,Personal luxury,This hotel is my so far first choice when staying in London. The hotel has a very personal touch by all the staff members and you are beein reconized by everyone in the staff who always are willing to help you with anything.  Just a few minutes to Kenington high str supwaystation or just take the bus a few step from the hotel if you like to travel above ground.   The food is excellent by the Norwegian chef and so so good.  We stayed for two days and had a lovely time and it's just ashame we did not have time to try the poolrelaxing area.  My warmest recommendations.
November 2012,A milestone spent at the Milestone.,"After reading the very many favourable Trip Advisor reviews and the hotel's excellent & enticing web site I knew this was to be our base in central London for my wife's 50th birthday.  If one reads the hotel management's list of operational & service quality aspirations, for myself, one of the most significant is ; to attempt to exceed their customers expectations.The Milestone's happy and very attentive staff certainly achieve this goal. Particularly worthy of mention were the reception & door staff service levels, a very nice touch being the ability to remember customers names. Also, unusual, even for five star hotels, is the presence and availability of management which is obvious and transparent.  Firstly we were provided with an excellent initial tour from Alexa around the…"
November 2012,A home away from home,"This was the second time we stayed at The Milestone and quite simply, it is faultless. The warm service is what sets it apart from other 5-star hotels in London (and we have stayed at quite a few!). It feels like a home away from home --  everyone who works at the hotel goes out of their way to ensure that all your needs are met and are all genuinely accommodating and courteous. The interior feels like you are staying in a private English house and the atmosphere is just spectacularly cosy and intimate. Absolutely amazing -- THE place to stay in London."
November 2012,Fabulous stay :),"We recently stayed at The Milestone and it was a short but wonderful experience. The hotel is elegant and pristine and the staff make you feel very welcome.  The room was lovely as was the bathroom, with luxurious towels and good quality products. Breakfast was superb and all the small touches in the room to welcome us were very thoughtful and very much appreciated. Staff are very friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble. Would definitely stay here again :)"
November 2012,A delightful experience,"My mom and dad stayed there for 5 nights and they had a great time. Their stay was perfect and said they would most likely stay there again. The Hotel interior and exterior looks great giving a atmosphere of being in the old English Era. The rooms are cosy and stylishly decorated giving a good feeling of the English way of living. The staff may it be the front desk, the cleaning staff or the concierge services all were very warm, kind and helpful. The breakfast was splendid as well specially the tea which was presented in a lovely way.  The location was great and being near the beautiful Hyde Park, my mom and dad used to go daily for morning walks. Finding taxis was also a breeze and the main market was a small walk away. There were also many restaurant nearby suiting many…"
September 2012,Luxury home away from home,"The good: Beautiful Victorian house, SUPERB CUSTOMER CARE, cozy common areas, great bar, and beautiful tea room.  Incredible staff that one would like to take home (special mention to: Pedro the ""everything to everyone guy"", Markus and Dickson at the bar, and the concierge staff). We were in a large family group so I was able to see several rooms.  All are uniquely decorated and well appointed, with the deluxe rooms being on the smaller side and some lacking in storage area, but with good modern bathrooms.  The Safari jr. suite is fabulous The not so good: At the southwest end of Hyde Park (Kensington Gardens), it is not walking distance from the great area of attractions of Piccadilly, Oxford, Regent, Harrods, museums, Parliament, etc.  However there is a Tube station about 3…"
November 2012,wonderful hotel,I recently stayed at the Milestone Hotel (September 2012) and would definitely give it an excellent rating.  The room had every amenity (stayed in Deluxe King)  you could want and the staff couldn't do enough for you.  The location was good - right near the hop on/off bus - I would definitely stay there again and would highly recommend it.    cj - connecticut
November 2012,Concierge not helpful,"I am staying at the hotel now..I booked through AmEx Fine Hotel and Resorts program. The hotel is located in a mostly resdiential area. The main sites in London, according to the concierge are a 25 minute cab ride away. With the exchange rate, that's about 50 dollars, one way.  I asked the concierge this evening for a nice place in the area to get the flavor of London and he didn't have any suggestions.    The rest of the staff is helpful, but I expected more the for the rating and the cost."
October 2012,Great Service,"I booked a superior room, which was the cheapest fare. Well everything is definitely 5-star, except the size of the room. It feels smaller than Travelodge rooms. One might think its ecological because the room heats up by your body heat, (its that small, but you get what you pay) but then on the other hand, using the aircondition or opening the window helps. Still great, will come again. The small room is fine for a night and on single occupancy. Staying longer needs upgrading..."
July 2012,Wonderful experience,"Stayed here as part of a birthday celebration. We could not fault the hotel at all. What a beautiful place but what made the stay perfect was the staff. Everyone who worked in the hotel were polite, friendly and helpful. We will definitely be staying at the milestone again. Thank you again for such a wonderful time."
November 2011,Afternoon tea at the Milestone :),"My teenage daughter, husband and I really enjoyed the afternoon tea experience at the Milestone.  The service is incredible, the tea rooms are just as the pictures show and the tea and cakes - unforgettable!  We had a wonderful time.  Our waiter was very funny, putting us at ease."
October 2012,my absolute favorite!!,"My fiancé and I are pretty seasoned travelers and have stayed in some amazing hotels all over, but OMIGOD this is my hands-down favorite hotel!! we usually go for more contemporary hotels with modern design, so we were wary of the very traditional look of the Milestone initially. As soon as we parked our car around the corner (!!! we could PARK...that was a great start! haha) and walked in the lobby, we were blown away by how wonderful and attentive the staff were. Our bags were whisked away and replaced with flutes of champagne, and we were greeted by name...""You must be Mr and Mrs Rawding, welcome"". The looks on our faces mustve been priceless. What a stellar greeting. As we were checking in, we were casually lamenting the fact that we were unable to secure a reservation at…"
August 2012,warts and all review,"My wife and I have just returned from a weekend at the Milestone Hotel to celebrate our 14th wedding anniversary. I've been lucky enough to stay at some wonderful hotels throughout the world, both on business and for pleasure from Bournemouth to Bora Bora, but have to say this was one of the nicest experiences yet.   From Manvee on the phone when booking, the doorman on arrival, the reception staff, the concierge, the bar staff (fantastic cocktails by the way!) and the cleaner I passed in the hallway Sunday morning; every interaction with the people who work there leave you feeling like a truly valued customer.  I'm trying to give a balanced review, warts and all, but I honestly I can't fault it.   Following my hotel choice my wife finally recognises what a great bloke I am, so…"
September 2012,olympic experience,"returned to The Milestone for the second Olympic week to celebrate 2 birthdays and an anniversary and everything about our stay confirmed that this hotel is an outstanding property. Our room, overlooking Kensington Gardens was beautiful and the staff was once again friendly, pleasant and went out of their way to make us feel like valued guests. Our anniversary was noted with roses and candles making  our first evening on this trip a special memory.If you have an opportunity, a stay at TheMilestone is a experience not to be missed."
November 2011,Milestone Apartment = Amazing!,"Where to start praising this amazing hotel? My husband and I stayed in Apartment 1 for seven nights in mid-September. First of all, the staff was incredible. We never walked through the lobby without someone acknowledging ""Mr. and Mrs. Jones"" and holding open a door, or calling us a cab. Everyone is so friendly and service-oriented. The hotel itself is great! The decor is beautiful and the dining & bar areas are very cozy.   Apartment 1 was great! There's a large living room/lounge on the main floor. We sat there a few times to catch the light coming in through the windows. The bedrooms, bathrooms and kitchen are downstairs; basically in a basement-like area. At first, it seemed a little darker and ""closer"" down there. But, after hearing some bumps and such from the floor above…"
October 2012,Top draw,"Great location with superb service. Drink on arrival little slow but everything else very good. Modest size room but lovely decor and it seemed every time we ventured out, the room was turned down with candles, chocolates and lovely touches, even champagne on arrival. Staff could not have been more helpful and seemed to care about our stay. Expensive but a real treat and ideal for an anniversary or a special occasion."
October 2012,Simply World Class,"I was lucky enough to stay at the hotel on the 7th & 8th October. As a regular customer, I am accustomed to the exceptional levels of staff service.  In this occasion my father was also with me for the trip. He's never experienced anything like the level of service in his life - this from a member at Gleneagles! Colin, the head chauffeur was outstanding. Pedro, Attila, Alexa, Jess, Fran and Abdi were simply the best. Thanks guys. As for Andrew - you have the best hotel team on the planet. Congratulations.  Colin Rowley"
October 2012,Milestone reviewers were correct,"Thanks to previous reviews that drew my attention to another boutique, and yes expensive, gem of a hotel in a convenient setting for our recent leisure visit in London. When one arrives as early as us (0730) and to be warmly greeted by many staff, offered tea while the room was prepared by 0900 - that's a standard that equalled another boutique hotel we used last year. The doorman remembered our names every day. The superior room had all the quietness with the amenities one expects. We ate only breakfast in the restaurant and it met our needs until night. Well equipped gym was our daily jet lag fix. Close to a tube station,buses to the centre adjacent, and good eateries in the high street.And of course the park straight opposite."
September 2012,40th wedding anniversary visit,"We returned to the Milestone Hotel on 30th September to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary. This was our first visit since our wedding reception there in 1972 and I managed to keep it as a surprise from my wife until the last minute. It was therefore a very special visit for us both.  The build up to it involved the co-operation of the hotel staff who were very supportive throughout making suggestions to ensure that our visit would be perfect. And so it was. From the second we entered the hotel to the second we left, we were treated to a level of service which made us feel very special. This attitude was prevalent in every single member of staff with whom we came into contact. What struck us was not just their courteous, helpful nature and a genuine willingness to please,…"
September 2012,A wonderful place to spend a special anniversary,"A truly special hotel. Have spent time at a number of superb hotels but none can touch the sheer elegance of the Milestone. The warm and friendly staff leave no stone unturned to make sure that the guests have everything that they require. On returning from our evening meal we were overwhelmed to find that the room had been decorated with rose petals and was bathed in candle light. A brilliant touch. Go treat yourself, you won't regret it!"
December 2012,Weekend away,So many hotels in number to choose from but the previous reviews made this almost an obligatory choice.Great location and the staff are excellent in making you welcome and delivering a very personal and attentive service. The facilities and the ambience are first rate and I would have no hesitation in enjoying the experience again. A great team of people running a special hotel.
October 2012,Great experience!,"I was so glad that I've choosen this hotel for my short trip to London. I was staying on my own on December 2011 ( sorry guys. I know this is a little late to write but wanted to share my experience) to take care some staff for my family. Being away from my family and boyfiend during Christmas time, I was not so excited to be in London alone. That was changed after entering this hotel. When I arrived, I was greeted warmly and got all the assistance needed. They also put nice Christmas tree in my room. Everyone was so kind and the service was very personal. I felt at home and felt warm. One of the best experience at hotel for sure. Thank you!"
December 2012,Amazing,My mother and I stayed here for three nights. The service was fantastic; they went above and beyond helping us in so many ways. The location is perfect. Every village we wanted to visit was close.   ~Julie
December 2012,Old English class and style,"My family stayed at the Milestone for my mother's 80th birthday, it was the perfect choice. The reception staff and doorman were impeccable, curteous and helpful without being overbearing. The rooms were compact, but plenty big enough and the bathrooms were well appointed with a good size bath and excellent shower in one unit.  Make sure you visit the bar while you are there and chat to the excellent staff, I spent a very enjoyable evening talking to the barman and a guest from Boston as we tried to decipher the rules of cricket. The dinner to celebrate my mother's birthday was excellent. The food was superb and the wine list, although it has plenty of wines that cost more than my first car, also contains plenty of good affordable wines. Make sure you include breakfast with your…"
November 2012,My second stay,"Hotel is still one of the nicest I have stayed in and so glad they had their Christmas decorations up as stayed in the Springtime before. Unfortunately some things were a bit disappointing and just felt the attention to detail was missing in some areas. We had completed the preference form prior to arriving so couldn't understand why the fruit platter had only one of the fruits we asked for on it, did we get one meant for someone else? The evening meal was booked fo 7.p.m. on our preference form but the confirmation when it came was booked for 5.30.p.m. My friend had to contact the hotel to point out this error so we then received further confirmation for 7.30 p.m. which we decided to leave it at this time as it was only 30 minutes difference. We duly arrived at 7.30.p.m. and…"
December 2012,My 3rd stay not to sure about a 4th,"My friend and myself stayed here for 2 nights and although I love this hotel I think there were little things that let it down.  On arrival our room wasn't quite ready and we were offered a glass of champagne while we waited which was a lovely touch. We sat in the bar area chatting to Markus who is lovely.  Our room was ready in about 10mins so up went to room 203 which was lovely, in fact so nice we spent most of our time there.  On checking our fruit platter they gave us the wrong fruit. Not a big problem but that have never happened before. We went down to have a pre dinner drink and the canapes that have been served in previous years have gone downhill. One bread stick between us and the tiny toasted sanwiches were quite greasy also we had nearly finished our drinks before…"
November 2012,So happy to be back at The Milestone!,"Nothing is finer than returning to The Milestone- especially during the festive season when it looks especially lovely.   My husband and I just took a vacation to Italy and we passed through London on both ends of the trip.    We stayed at the Milestone for a total of 5 nights and every night was superb.    No matter which suite you get, you will be thrilled.   They are all lovely and unique.    I'm quite convinced that the staff is the best in London (if not the world).  If I sound like I'm a little over the top about this hotel, it is because I am.    It is that good.     We also had dinner on two different nights at the hotel restaurant-- Chenestons.  It is also lovely and the food is a real treat.    The location across the street from Kensington Palace is my favorite spot…"
November 2012,Somehow we missed the personal touch,"Our overall experience at this hotel was positive and I would recommend it to anyone, particularly those interested in the Kensington area, but they do have some opportunities for improvement.  The pros include:  decor and overall charm, quality of linens and toiletries, excellent tea, location in Kensington.  Unfortunately the concierge was less than helpful.  I asked for some inside information on visiting Westminster Abbey and was quoted the hours of operation.  The breakfast was average.  Although lovely our deluxe king room was quite compact with a very small window; however, the bathroom was large.  I was irritated because there was a planned disruption to the tube lines that service the hotel as well as a protest near the hotel on the Saturday that we were there.  Most…"
October 2012,Delicious afternoon tea,"Afternoon tea is such an elegant way of spending your (rainy) afternoon, especially when done in such a lovely decor as in the Milestone. We'd made reservations well in advance and requested to be seated near the fireplace. We did get these seats and it is lovely, though quite warm. Make sure you have something to take off if you request these seats. Next time, I'd ask to be seated under the 'Wimbledon painting'. You'll have to be in a group of four. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the three o'clock session ran late (the hotel has three 'rounds', each two hours). We were called in advance by the hotel informing us of this. They were very apologetic and I think they handled it superb. Staff was very friendly, service was excellent. Food was good. All in all a delightful and…"
November 2012,Beautiful Victorian Hotel with Impeccable Service,"We stayed at this hotel on Wednesday 31st October for one night. Firstly I have to say that usually when I book a hotel it never lives up to the expectation that I imagine, I have to say with this hotel it was exactly as I imagined and more.  We were greeted on arrival by Fran one of the butlers who kindly offered to show us around the hotel, the Victorian lounge was beautiful where the afternoon teas are served, the restaurant and bars were all so lovely and very impressive, creating a fine but cosy atmosphere. On arrival to our room we found we had been upgraded to a deluxe room which was lovely, as it was our wedding anniversary and this made it all very special. We booked this hotel as we were visiting the Royal Albert Hall to see Diana Krall, and I have to say this hotel is…"
September 2012,Brilliant!,"My daughter (9 years) and I were treated like queens.  I could not imagine a more comfortable, caring oasis in a busy city.  We loved London but we really loved coming ""home"" and seeing what personal touches awaited us in our room...one day a cake, another my child's name spelled out in letters on the bed, and some light snacks.  Speical marks to Dixon and Alexa for their kindnesses and personal attention."
September 2012,It couldn't have been a better stay...,"We stayed at the Milestone Hotel on Saturday for one night for a long weekend in London for  a celebration. We arrived by taxi, and were met by a well dressed doorman, ( Hat and tails) who advised us to leave the luggage and to go into the hotel, ' he would look after the luggage for us. - our weekend had started straight away.   We were met by very welcoming staff politely and quietly in a sincere and warm fashion. Lovely.   Check In was confirmed and we were advised we were in a beautiful room and luggage would follow shortly. It did - within 7 minutes on arrival in our room ! The room was breathtaking, and a birthday card was on the table from the staff and management and a birthday cake followed within minutes after a phone call offering a welcome drink, whilst we got ready…"
September 2012,Afternoon tea *****,Had afternoon tea today at the milestone I was a bit nervous going in as it was really posh deffinatly not a jeans n tshirt place. On entering the hotel the staff were really friendly and welcoming. The afternoon tea was super we had the half bottle of champagne option and for london and the selection and amount of food you got I felt it was good value. 
August 2012,Excellent service will so many extra personal touches,"We stayed at the Milestone as part of a birthday/anniversary treat.  Nothing was too much trouble, the staff were friendly and very welcoming. Our room was spotless and we were greeted with a welcome glass of champagne to help us settle in.  Well recommended!"
September 2012,Superb,"Stayed there with my miss while visiting friends in London. If you are used to 5-star service, this hotel will not disappoint. Spacious and very well appointed rooms, decorated in Victorian style, friendly staff, personalised service. Location is fantastic, even if you (like we) are not interested in doing much tourism. We stayed there for 2 nights and had wish our visit was longer. Will definitely stay back if back in London."
September 2012,"If you want white glove service, this is your place","Stayed at the Milestone for 3 nights at the concluding part of a longer stay in GB.  We have travelled fairly extensively throughout the world and can say that the level of service at the Milestone is as good as we have experienced anywhere.   The property is beautifully decorated in an estate style, without seeming overwhelming.  If you want a grand soaring lobby with overwhelming spaces, this is not for you.  But if you want genteel luxury, try out the Milestone.  Note that our room was a bit cramped, although well furnished.  If you want a larger room, such are available at a higher price point, but in truth this is a true 5 star property and is priced accordingly so this comment is made by way of advice and not complaint, since if you plan to stay here, cost is probably not…"
September 2012,What a wonderful stay,"We only stayed the one night,however the hotel and staff were fantastic throughout. Celebrating our Annivesary,they could not have done any more to make it feel so wonderful. The service we received from every member of staff was of the highest quality and we were made to feel very special at all times. On returning from our night out the romm was prepared and rose petals were scatterred throught and candles were lit everywhere.The English Breakfast was suberb. The Afternoon Tea was truly devine and a lovely way to end our stay at the Hotel. We look forward to going back again in the very near future."
October 2011,Simply the best,My wife and I spent 2 nights at the Milestone.  After a long flight from Australia we were delighted by the level of service from the time we arrived.  Nothing was too much trouble for the wonderful staff.  The room was comfortable and the facilities everything you could ever need. There is also no better location for seeing the sights of London.  We would recommend it to anyone!
September 2012,HOME AWAY FROM HOME,"This review is well overdue as it has been a while since our last stay at this beautiful hotel/home.   Rooms are beautiful, service is charming, food is fantastic. Everything is close by. Nothing is too much trouble. Children are treated so kindly by such friendly staff.   In summary, it's like stepping into a bubble of calm and homeliness after a busy day in London. Great for families, business and lone travellers.   Love it. Would not stay anywhere else - unless fully booked! Many thanks for such a memorable stay."
August 2012,glamorous holidays,It is a gorgeous hotel located in one of the richest areas of London. Luxury rooms and provided with very adequated facilities. Butler service is provided for the guests. The staff is highly educated and efficient. A hotel to come back!
July 2012,Royal Treatment,"This was our first trip to London and we are so glad that a friend recommended The Milestone Hotel.  From the moment we walked in until the day we left, every staff member treated us like royalty.  Truly no request was too small.  When checking in we had an unexpected and much appreciated upgrade to an apartment that we fell in love with immediately.  Every area of The Milestone was so beautiful and elegant with lovely rooms to hang out and relax and have a drink or cup of tea. If you go, do not miss out on a fantastic culinary experience in The Cheneston Restaurant.  We are looking forward to another trip next year and would not think of staying anywhere else.  Doug and Sherry G"
July 2012,Lovely,"Recently been to London for a business trip and stayed in this hotel for 2 nights. They have lovely,comfortable and cozy rooms, great service and nice atmosphere, staff were very friendly and helpful. I would love to stay here again"
July 2012,Wonderful hotel!,We spent three fabulous days at The Milestone Hotel.  The staff was by far the best we've ever encountered.  They knew our names and went out of their way to spoil us!  The welcome gifts were very thoughtful and the treats in the evening were much appreciated.  Our 10 year old daughter was thrilled with the assortment of candies and goodies placed with her in mind! Our room was gorgeous and we had an incredible view of Kensington.  The Milestone Hotel was the first of three 5-Star Hotels we visited during our 9 day vacation in Europe and it was by far our favorite!  We hope to stay with you again!
July 2012,Great hotel,"This is a lovely boutique hotel.  The staff are extremely helpful and friendly.  Every staff member called me by name (not totally sure how they all knew!)  The welcome gifts in the room are a nice surprise.  Nice parting letter stating they can pack your luggage or pack you an  ""airline picnic.""  Although my room was small, it was very cozy and beautifully decorated!"
July 2012,Excellent service hotel,"I have just spent a night in the Milestones but I was trully surprised with the details offered in every moment (ex. cookies in the room + welcome drink and cappuccino for my daughter + handwritten welcome card), efficiency in reservation, check-in, room service, the personalized service calliing my surname from the begginning to the end, from bellman to housekeeper. The room was not very big but the bed was.  There was robe for me and my 9 year old daughter, and all kind of facilities in the bathroom and room. What called my attentio was the service in the hotel in all sections.  It was great to spend the last day of the trip in the Milestones and I was very pleased with it."
June 2012,Friendly,"The Hotel is well located,the house keepers are friendly and the service works well."
June 2012,A lovely place to stay,"We greatly appreciated the attention to detail, personal service and willingness to take care of all our needs. Loved the cocktail lounge where the bartenders remembered what you drink and they provide great snacks. Breakfast was always spot on. We also liked the treats on our pillows each of the 5 nights we were there.  Bottom line is that the Milestone a lovely place to stay in London!"
June 2012,The Milestone is a top notch hotel!!!,"We were originally recommended the Milestone by our AMEX platinum travel agent, I believe she had personally stayed there before. We were not disappointed! We were met by Pedro when we arrived, and he showed us around the Hotel and was generally there most of the time to help with anything. My wife 92 year old grandmother lives outside of London and came to visit us after an hour after we arrived, they brought her to the small lounge / bar and we had drinks and snacks and had a great time. Our room was really beautiful and very well kept. My wife and I brought our 6 year old daughter with us and the hotel was nice enough to bring a small little bed in at the foot of our bed. Every night she had a small robe and pair of slippers waiting for her. The concierge always got us last…"
July 2012,"Luxurious, perfect position, fantastic staff, charcter filled and ""clubby""","We stayed at this hotel twice during May and June. The hotel is small, has many nooks and crannies and emanates  the air of a private club. We have studio suites and the rooms were relatively small, this is London though!! The bed and fittings were first class and our view of Kensington gardens was suberb.  The staff were helpful, attentive and genuine motivated to engage with the guests.  This hotel is not like a lrge open plan ""Hilton"" style hotel - think Victorian/Edwardian period biulding with lots of character.   All in all a great experience."
July 2012,The Milestone Hotel - Apartment #3,"The Milestone is a very nice English Country Mansion in the heart of London. We stayed in one of the properties two-bed room apartments (which is part of the hotel). Our apartment was well appointed and fully functional, with plenty of space for my family. Please note there were plenty of outlets for all of our electronics to recharge.  Even though we were in a fully functional apartment, we took full advantage of the hotel's facilities for breakfast and afternoon tea. The staff we interacted with were very attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly, without being overly formal. I would recommend the Milestone for many reasons, however, the primary driver for my recommendation would be the staff, due to their dedication to ensuring we had a positive experience.  Heyward Damon, Jr.…"
September 2012,The Milestone let us down,"Last summer we spent several days at the Milestone which prompted my first Trip Advisor review. We loved every inch of the hotel and found the service impeccable. As strangers, we felt completely taken care of and we were welcomed as if we were old friends with every member of the staff. We have just returned from another stay at the Milestone, this time with our 15 year old son. We requested two rooms for the first 4 nights and then one for the remaining 3. A month prior to the trip we asked if we could extend our stay for another few nights which the hotel could not accommodate. When we arrived, the dates were mixed up and they had my son in the larger room meant clearly meant for a couple. Switching the rooms seemed impossible to the person in charge at the front desk, and my…"
August 2012,No better hotel in London,"We stayed here again and it was, as before, perfection.  Everything about the hotel is top notch - intimate common areas, concierge, blue light in the bathroom at night, turndown service, etc., but best of all is the first-rate staff and the impeccable service.  You call once and it is done.  We will definitely be back!"
August 2012,Flawless Hospitality,"I wanted to take the time to share my excellent experience at The Milestone Hotel this summer.  I had the privilege of working along side the management team for a high profile Canadian corporate group who were attending the 2012 Olympic summer games in London. I truly could not have been more impressed by the genuine hospitality that I received from the entire service team. The Milestone Hotel was our base for 3 weeks and every one of our guests were completely impressed and delighted with all the staff that they encountered. I myself have worked in the hospitality industry for 20 years and have never in my career seen such passion for service as I did with this team. Their motto of ""No request is too large - No detail is too small"" is evident in all departments. Sometimes it…"
August 2012,"Fantastic hotel, Wonderful experience","I got to know the hotel in February when I was looking for a place to have afternoon tea in London and found the address on the list of the Top London Tea Place Awards 2011. I had the chance to visit some of the rooms at that time and immediately fell in love with the hotel and could not think about anything else than coming back. The decoration is exactly matching my taste; it is very traditional and very beautiful. So after a few months of patience and of dreaming about it, I finally came back last weekend and had an amazing stay. I had booked a superior double room and was hoping secretly to get upgraded, and when I arrived at the reception I was informed that my wish came true and I was offered a Deluxe King!! The room was magnificent with a beautiful view on Kensington…"
May 2012,Unforgettable weekend.... Thank you!,"My wife and i stayed at the milestone for our one year wedding anniversary recently and it was without doubt the best hotel experience we have ever had. Having stayed at a number of London's finest hotels this hotel truly trumps them all. Everything was absolutely perfect from start to finish, the staff are all absolutely charming, polite, engaging and clearly all enjoying their time at the Milestone as much as we were. This creates a wonderfully relaxed yet refined experience, perfect for a romantic getaway. As mentioned in most of the other reviews here, the little touches and extras provided really do make the difference and this really makes the Milestone stand out from the crowd. Thank you again to all the staff we met, and we are both recommending the hotel to anyone who…"
August 2012,Milestone - outstanding experience,"I love everything about this hotel. From the minute you make contact to plan your stay, the service, my room, personal touch on every level is like being home and treated with special care. The accomodations were lovely - the location was perfect for getting around London - easy  walk to the tube; great neighborhood to explore; great  restaurants, museums and parks in walking distance; I was traveling alone some of the time and never felt lonely or unattended to. Staff are like friends now. Concierge staff, bar staff, front desk staff, restaurant staff-everyone looking for ways to make your stay perfect.The restaurant was wonderful -  Hotel manager Andrew sets the right culture of service there and I know something about this in my line of business. I've been twice now and…"
July 2012,Milestones Hotel,"Everything about this little botique hotel was perfect. The staff, ambiance, quality, service, friendliness, helpfullness and above all the entire experience was excellent.  Everyone did as much as they could to ensure your stay was perfect. We were addressed by name as soon as we arrived, our car was parked and collect for us. My boyfriend had a birthday gift and card.  If you needed anything they were only to willing to help. We will be back and just know it will be a wonderful experience.  It was recommended by the Royal Albert Hall and so they gave us a 20% which created a good feel."
July 2012,Wonderful Stay,"We stayed there for a couple of weeks, Great location right across from the park,the hotel offers a lovely atmosphere, very friendly, traditional English decor which we loved. Great service. We will definitely go back."
July 2012,The Milestone Hotel - the very Best of British !!,I stayed at The Milestone for the first week of the Olympics.This Hotel made the holiday even more memorable.This is the best hotel I have ever stayed in and it is the staff who make it such a great place. The service is excellent and you are made to feel so welcome and so much at home. Additionally the Hotel is in a great location in London so that you can walk to all the main tourist attractions after having a wonderful breakfast of fresh fruit and cooked English.The rooms - both bedrooms and public rooms are extremely comfortable and cosy.No request is too much to ask for.I cannot recommend this Hotel more highly and I am already planning my next stay here. David Cullen
July 2012,Excellent,"Stayed here few nights and loved every moment. The hotel has lovely cosy rooms, staff are very friendly, service is great and atmosphere is so welcoming . They makes you feel so valued and special. Highly recommended!"
June 2012,BEYOND BELIEF!!,"We just arrived safely back in Vancouver, BC after an absolutely AMAZING 5 night stay at the Milestone Hotel in London.  I could not get to the computer fast enough to write this review and tell the world how wonderful the Milestone made our stay in London. From the moment we turned to walk into your hotel, we had respectful, kind and caring greeters waiting to help us. Waves, smiles and extremely professional-classy engagement from everyone in the lobby occurred on every venture through the area. It really felt like coming home to a welcoming family each time we landed from a very long, fun-filled, busy Olympic days....""The mist"" (as Grant called it) never drizzled on anyone spirits! Our room, the service, the fresh flowers and elegance of our surroundings were second to none.…"
June 2012,THE MILESTONE HOTEL-LONDON.  BEST EXPERIENCE EVER!!,"I was at the Milestone many years ago with my elderly aunt and had a wonderful experience so I  decided I would stay there on this 3 week Europe trip with my 13 year old granddaughter.  We stayed in wonderful hotels across Europe but none came close to The Milestone!   From the minute we arrived everyone treated us as if there were thrilled to see us!  The doorman, the bellman, the concierge, the front desk clerk, the assistant manager, the manager...everyone made us feel so welcomed.  Jose was really the best concierge ever!!  I am so very  glad this is where i was when the accident occurred!  My granddaughter and I were a couple of streets away when i fell over a fallen sign on the sidewalk.  i looked down and saw my thumb laying sideways...not a pretty sight!  My…"
May 2012,A gem in a gem,"The Milestone Hotel has big luxury in a small, intimate and beautiful space.  The location is fantastic, right where you want to be in London.  The rooms are magnificent and all of the comforts you can imagine are there (and even some you cannot imagine). The food, especially the afternoon tea, is the best in London and the staff is beyond gracious.  The Milestone is a treasure in one of the greatest cities in the world.  I highly recommend it!"
May 2012,A good reason to return to London,"We stayed here for three days in May.  We love this area but had never stayed here before. It was recommended by our travel agent and she was absolutely right about the quality. We arrived in the early evening, exhausted by the nightmare of coming through customs and  immigration at Heathrow.  The first room we were shown was too small and taken up by  furniture.  The manager said he would try to find us another room - although since it was late in the day that might prove a problem.  He was successful.  While we waited we were shown into the library and offered a drink - a perfect example of the hospitality shown to guests here.  The  king size room was not very large but big enough and furnished beautifully as is the entire hotel. Since we were too tired to go out for dinner…"
June 2012,Very good,"Amazing service, lovely rooms, friendly staff.highly recommended"
July 2012,Loved our stay at the Milestone Hotel,A lovely hotel located in the Kensington area.  Quaint and attentive to all the details.  The concierge provided helpful information and arranged reservations and tours for us.  In the evenings we enjoyed the Stables Bar where we met new friends.  I would recommend this hotel for those going to London.
June 2012,Lovely individual rooms,"This is a very posh establishment in the Kensington area.  The decor is quintessentially traditional yet extravagent English with modern touches.  As it is very expensive, I used a lot of Amex points to defray some of the costs.  We were upgraded to a junior suite - the Viscount Suite - that has lovely views of the park.  Please note that it is on the front side of the building so that can be some traffic noise.  The hotel will provide earplugs on request.  As is usual, the junior suite is a larger room, rather than a suite.  We were celebrating a milestone anniversary and they decorated the room with candles, rose petals, and chocalate covered strawberries.  Although that is not really my thing, we appreciated the effort.  It underscores the difference between a 5 star…"
June 2012,Awesome,"Had an opportunity to spend few nights at this hotel. My overall experience was really great. They have lovely and comfortable rooms, great service, awesome staff. I would love to stay here again"
July 2012,A fine experience,"The first stay here was excellent, and the second one was better. During either stay the service was exceptional. This is a small boutique hotel with an intimate feel of quiet, understated comfort, whether at dinner, in the bar or in the library with a drink. The dining room is small, serves a fine menu with care, and is best reserved for dinner.  Breakfast is full and satisfying. The staff quickly picks up on your preferences. The rooms, with different themes, are well furnished with comfortable, well-made beds and thoughtful ammenities. The bathrooms are immaculate. But, the rooms can be small by U.S. standards.  The hotel is located in Kensington, near the Palace, the V&A, and, I understand, the only Whole Foods in London. Pubs and restaurants are nearby and easily found. The…"
July 2012,Lunch at The Milestone,"As a restauranteur I like to check out what is happening within Kensington and Chelsea. I had given up hope on all of the hotels in the area who have consistently not had the courage to stand behind their own dining rooms but I had a whisper that consistency was being dished up with a flourish at The Milestone. I was unknown but treated to Custers last stand in terms of in hotel dining. I was not a guest so I can't speak for the rooms but the consideration and truly decent food that I was given are what I can praise them on. Simple and brilliant....hand sliced Irish and Scottish smoked salmon followed by an incredible Dover Sole in buerre blanc. Stuffed, satisfied and delighted. Go."
June 2012,Fantastic?  Depends on what you are looking for...,"Just left the Milestone after a one week stay.  This is a quaint, charming, well appointed boutique hotel in a great location.  We were booked there thru Abercrombie and Kent who stated it was one of the best in London.  I am not writing to say it was not a nice hotel.  But it depends on what your expectations are.    In choosing a hotel one thing we like is comfortably roomy accommodations.  I realize that in London (like New York City), that space is not something easily accommodated.  But the size of these rooms was ridiculous.  After our initial disappointment, we were upgraded to a suite.  However, it was a two story suite and the bedroom on the second level was as small as the room we had initially been shown to.   Not only was the room small but there were NO drawers, the…"
May 2012,Don't miss it!,"This is the place to stay in London. We were there last week for several days and it was fabulous.  Well located, close to everything but away from the big tourist crowds and noise, with the beautiful Kensington Gardens opposite where one can hire a bike. We enjoyed walking to the V&A and the local shops and restaurants. The room was large, very comfortable, just like home, not like a hotel at all.  After a tiring day I just enjoyed going back to the room for a rest in the afternoon light. I don't know why I left!"
May 2012,Fantastic Hotel,"A must stay hotel, great service, stunning rooms, food absolutely delicious. The breakfast pancakes were super. Walked to The Albert Hall from there for a show, when we arrived back at the hotel our bathroom had candles lit all around the bath, with soft music playing in the room.  On departure we were offered bottle water for our return journey home. One little fault, they had no skimmed milk when I arrived,  made do with semi skimmed, maybe I am to fussy!!"
May 2012,Lovely hotel,"I was very excited about staying here and the hotel didn't disappoint.  The only thing that I could fault was that the iron in the room wasn't any good so we had to send some shirts out - other than that, the experience was seamless.  Staff were lovely and very helpful."
June 2012,First class delightful hotel,"This beautiful boutique hotel was recommended to me by Amex Platinum card concierge and they did not disappoint in any way. The room was large by European standards and full of antiques and little gifts like fruit, tea and candies from the hotel. There was twice a day room service and it was so nice to come back from sightseeing to see bottles of water and crystal glasses on the nightstands ready for us. The breakfasts were absolutely delicious and I highly recommend having afternoon tea at the Milestone if you are a guest or not. The ambiance in the room where the tea is served is just perfect and the food was top quality. The hotel is across from Kensington Park and away from the mad rush but we walked to Albert Hall, Harrods, Fortnums & Mason, The Victoria & Albert museum. I…"
June 2012,Good Service but Pretty Expensive,It was my first tour to London for Business. This hotel has a eye catching building and good service. I like it because of its Luxurious Accommodations and Good behaving staff. service is over all good. I like the top floor. Its pretty quiet here and good place to stay. Kensington Park is near to it and I like view of it from top floor room.
May 2012,Earns Its Five Stars,"In the realm of attentive service, luxury accommodations and attention to detail, The Milestone ranks in the very top tier of all the hotels we've been privileged to enjoy around the world. Afternoon tea service is impeccable. Even its restaurant was absolutely wonderful with a first class chef and sommelier, which is often not the case with hotel dining. Lord willing, we will visit this beautiful city again and, without a doubt, stay at The Milestone."
June 2012,Anniversary Trip,"My wife and I have traveled extensively and stayed at some great hotels. The Milestone surpassed all. The staff is superb and dedicated to excellent service. The hotel's location, across from Kensington Park, allows for a pleasant escape from the city and a beautiful view from one's room."
May 2012,Great Hotel,"If you like smaller Hotels, we could not review this one more highly. Personal and attentive service, clean rooms, and a lovely dining room. We stayed about a week at the end of May and look forward to going back this August. Nice and quiet, beautifull old world decor.....and the breakfast buffet is good."
June 2012,Lovely first visit,"A friend recommended The Milestone Hotel for our first trip to London.  We're so grateful for this perfect introduction to a wonderful city.   Lovely, quiet atmosphere, classic British decor and first class service."
May 2012,Gorgeous Hotel with Top Notch Service!,"The Milestone has that quintessential English charm.  From the moment you arrive the staff can't do enough for you.  The rooms, while on the small side, are all beautiful and immaculately clean.  We only had breakfast (room service) at the hotel; it was delicious and it was delivered promptly.  Special commendations to all the staff, but especially Stephanie, Alisa (both at the front desk) and Jose (concierge) who all go above and beyond expectations to make sure you are happy.  It is located within a (very safe) 5 minute walk to the tube station.  Thank you to the Milestone for a special stay in London!"
May 2012,Fifth time and always a treat,"This is my fifth visit in the last two years. Great luxury hotel with a very good breakfast, very high class rooms and a good resturant for dinner. Small pool and gym. All in very good taste, high maintenance and good staff."
August 2011,Treat yourself,Just finished 7 days at the Milestone.  What a great taste of English living.  The hotel has a limited nuimber of rooms and a large staff that is constantly trying to please you.  No request is to small and they take pride in everything they do.    You just cannot go wrong by staying there.
May 2012,The Milestone,"Were there for a week. The rooms were charming and unique, but you need a suite to be able to move around, so that is what we got. The service is very personal and their afternoon tea the best I ever had. The concierge was very talented when it comes to restaurants but with a hiccup; I wanted  them to get us some theater tickets which they actually declined because their agent could not get them. These were not special tickets but this particular show was obviously not on their agents list. That was a let down. They also promised my son a special supprise at the Lion King show which never materialized. Thankfully I never told him so there were no expectations.  The spa looked liked like something from eastern europe 1940 so I never really tried the treatments. The breakfast was…"
March 2012,"Charming, Elegant Boutique Hotel near Kensington Palace","The Milestone Hotel exceeded my expectations. The service is top notch. The decor is breathtaking - my favorite area was the bar, which used to be the stables for this stately mansion. Each room is individually decorated with a distinct personality and when you book your reservation, the team will send you a ""preference list"" which will ask you for things like your favorite drink, newspaper, type of bedding, favorite colors, etc. I imagine this is how they select rooms for their guests, etc. If you are looking to stay in one of the best properties in London, the Milestone  Hotel needs to be on your list. And if the hotel wasn't enough to attract you, how about knowing that Kensington Palace sits literally across the street in Hyde Park? Also a great place for run!"
April 2012,Simply the home-liest hotel in London,"The Milestone Hotel is our home away from home while in London.  There's something very special about this boutique hotel starting with the location, the warmth of the entire staff, the overall ambience, the decor, the service, the food and above all, the personal touch given on personal requests - this aspect is what I consider to be the hallmark of this cozy hotel. Every request is given the kind of attention that makes one feel spoilt.  After trying several 5-star hotels in London, the Milestone Hotel remains the place for us.  Looking forward to my next visit this month for the 46th time in 7 years!"
April 2012,Excellent place to stay,"Very quiet, clean, upscale, and really cared for us.  Made sure we were doing ok - in a polite English way.  Meals, music with them, the tea in the afternoon, the frontdesk all made the stay one of our most pleasant and comfortable we have had."
April 2012,Faultless afternoon tea,"When in London, we usually have afternoon tea in one of the big five star hotels, so we weren't sure what to expect from a boutique hotel like the Milestone, but were seduced into trying it by an online photo of the Park Lounge. We weren't disappointed. The ambience of the Lounge was fantastic with rich fabrics and huge bookcases of old books - warm, welcoming and sumptuous. The tea itself was great: plentiful finger sandwiches, including a chicken one rolled in chopped almonds; light, warm scones with cream and a delightful strawberry/raspberry mixed jam, plus a good selection of dainty tea pastries - we needed a doggie bag for those! The service was attentive but discreet. We really couldn't fault the whole experience and look forward to going again."
April 2012,Absolute Gem,"Just had a wonderful weekend at the Milestone Hotel, and highly highly recommend this little gem.  I genuinely couldn't fault anything about this wonderful hotel, from the location, to the warm, welcoming and caring staff, to the gorgeous food and wine at the restaurant.  The room was charming, and the bed the most comfortable I've slept in.    Thank you for having us!"
April 2012,Second time around and still wonderful,"We stayed at the Milestone approximately two years ago and it was great, so we went back on our recent trip.  Things HAVE NOT changed.  We had a bigger suite this time, Prince Albert Master Suite and were much happier with the additional room.  Still great service and ambience.  Scones, tea sandwiches were lovely.  The restaurant is great.  Good going Milestone.  Many hotels do not maintain their excellent standards."
May 2012,Amazing afternoon tea,"I picked the Milestone for afternoon tea as the dining room looked really intimate, comfortable and had lovely charm. When we arrived the staff couldn't have been more polite or helpful. The selection of teas was fantastic and there was more than enough delicious sandwiches, warm scones and cakes to go round. Often with afternoon teas in London the cakes are a little sub standard, more attention going onto appearance than taste but that was definitely not the case here. We had a lovely relaxing afternoon, so much so that time ran away with us before we'd had a chance to have our complimentary cocktail but the staff we very willing to serve us in the bar area which was fabulous, very 'ralph lauren' style with horse painting and a cigar room vibe.  I'd whole heartedly recommend…"
May 2012,My Favorite Hotel in the World,"My husband and I love this hotel.    We have been staying at The Milestone since 2006 and each time we return, we are welcomed by the wonderful staff who make us feel like family.   The rooms are wonderful- each one different and a fun surprise to see which one you get. The staff is amazing- especially Pedro the Butler, who greets you upon arrival at the front door, takes you to your room and brings you your first welcome drink.   We love the location because my husband loves to jog in Kensington Park and I love to walk there and watch the people and their dogs.   The bar is one of my favorite in the world, as well, and the bartenders there have become our friends and they know our drinks before we even order.    The location is perfect and the hospitality is warm and welcoming.…"
November 2011,Thank you for a lovely stay,"Considering the price of this hotel compared to the Hilton, the service was far superior.  My room came with a butler and he went the extra mile for me.  It is not often i take the time out to comment, but I must recommend this hotel and all its staff highly."
May 2012,worth the money,this place is definately worth the money. It is in a good location - nice clean reliable hotel. 5 stars
May 2012,Wonderful Personal Hotel in the Heart of London,"Yes, the rooms can be small - but they are beautifully decorated, and every possible amenity is a hand - Penthaglion soap, cleanser, lip balm, 400 thread count sheets,and even the unexpected ones -- for example, the writing desk in the room had stapler, tape, etc.  The hotel is located right on Kensington Park - and the outside traffic can be a tad loud in the rooms fronting the main road -- but  overall the customer service experience is first rate.  I tried the restaurant for both breakfast and lunch and was wowed by the quality of the food and the service staff.  The quiet conservatory bar and adjacent cozy bar were terrific too - intimate spaces with loads of atmosphere.  Check in was so efficient and I never encountered less than two doormen at the front door!   The…"
May 2012,The best service ever.,"This hotel had the best service. If I even thought I wanted something, they were right there. The breakfast was amazing. The waffles are a work of art. The staff was friendly and helpful and the high tea was amazing. We stayed in the Safari suite. It was huge and decorated in a whimsical manner. The location is great. The tube station is right down the block and there is tons of shopping and places to eat, not to mention that Kensington Palace is right across the street. Don't miss the sunken garden, a hidden treasure! Loved it!"
April 2012,Average Hotel With Poor Internet Service,"I am basically confirming the comments made by those reviewers who rate this expensive hotel as merely average.  Our room was very small; we could hardly get past the furnishings and into the bathroom. Indeed, the latter was almost as big as the bedroom.  The staff was ungracious, with the front door being unmanned most evenings we returned from sightseeing.  Although there was staff inside, it was only on the third night of our four night stay that someone acknowledged us.   One of the most annoying things is the poor Internet service. I need to stay in contact with my several businesses through the Internet. Despite being assured of excellent Internet service when we booked, we kept getting bumped off, the signal was weak and the service was slow.  The location of the hotel in…"
March 2012,Fab afternoon tea,"I booked to have afternoon tea here while my Spanish friend visited with his Japanese girlfriend and was so happy I chose The Milestone. They were both totally blown away by the experience! They thought the setting in the park lounge, sat by the fire, was perfeclty British and couldn't get over how great the food was, nor how much of it there was!  Even my friend, husband and I for who this was not our first afternoon tea thought this was the best we have been to in London so far. It's really relaxed and cosy and the service is excellent, very attentive and they are very willing to bring more of whatever you need. Great selection of teas too. I would suggest booking later on in the day as there is more chance of getting a seat by the fire."
April 2012,Loved the Milestone,"I usually stay at the Royal Garden over the road (which I also love), but we had older members of the family who could afford the Milestone. It was a super experience.  We had a family do in central London and were in and out for two days. I can't thank the staff, and particularly the doorman, enough for how smooth they made it for us.  My old mother loved it and would love to stay there again.  But it would also be amazing for something romantic, like an anniversary. I adored breakfast in the lovely green dining room, and I thought what a lovely place it would be for a quiet breakfast meeting (again, in contrast to one at the Royal Garden which also has a lovely dining room but is usually busier). All in all it was a fantastic luxury experience."
November 2011,The Most Incredible Hotel in Kensington!,"My husband and I recently celebrated our 55th anniversary at The Milestone Hotel in London.  It was a return visit - we knew how fabulous the hotel, staff, and amenities would be. But this time, The Milestone staff went above and beyond!  When we returned from dinner on our anniversary, our room had been strewn with rose petals, floating candles were everywhere, champagne was chilling in the ice bucket, soft music was playing, and chocolate strawberries were on the desk!  What an amazing surprise!  Everything about the Milestone is perfect - the most elegant afternoon tea, a scrumptious breakfast buffet, and a concierge and butler who really care, and stand ready to help with even the tiniest request.  We love The Milestone, and hope to be back for another memorable visit in the…"
April 2012,worthy of the praise,"My review reflects the 5-star reviews of the Milestone's other guests. It is a quaint, friendly, warm and luxurious little hotel with a big hart. My daughter and I stayed here for 4 nights and enjoyed everything the hotel has to offer - from their superb dinners, lovely breakfast to high tea."
April 2012,Outstanding service and attention to detail,"A colleague and I stayed at this luxury hotel for two nights at short notice. The staff were extremely welcoming upon our arrival and gave us a guided tour of the facilities whilst our luggage was taken upstairs.  The rooms (a King Double and Studio) were unforgettable; true luxury which was a welcome retreat at the end of each day.  On top of the luxury of each room, the services were excellent. Satellite TV, reliable Internet access and top draw room service.  Our breakfast each morning was superb and the hotel is literally 3 minutes walk from High Street Kensington tube station (sadly our expenses policy didn't quite cover the use of the hotels Chauffeur driven Bentley...).  Highly recommended all round!"
April 2012,superb hotel,"Visited this hotel April 2012, and the hotel is exceptional in many ways; from top location to quality of rooms and decor, topped off with a commitment to great service you wont see in many places in London.  I was on business on this occasion but already looking into a family stay at the hotel.  All in all very special and although price reflects this - it is far superior to all of the chain hotels which offer similar rates."
March 2012,The most amazing experience,"We recently stayed at the Milestone Hotel in one of their apartments.  We were traveling with 2 teenage children and my mother.  The accomodations were fabulous!  We had so much space and the rooms were beautful. The service was exceptional...the hotel didn't know what to do for us next and the food was great. Breakfast was wonderful, we really enjoyed high tea and had a lovely dinner one eve in the hotel sitting by the fireplace. The concierge service was top notch. In fact, I forgot my house keys at the hotel and they immediately sent my keys back to me in the states. I travel alot for business and pleasure and must say that this was one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. I highly recommend this hotel and will definately stay there on our next trip to London.  It…"
April 2012,"Small, beautiful and excellent hotel! Wow!","We stayed one week at Milestone in March 2012.  This hotel is very special and is a real 5 stars hotel.  Beautiful decor in our room, excellent service from everybody from the concierge to the room service.  The food was excellent,  the decor unforgettable.  Everybody made us feel good.  Perfectly located.  We will choose this hotel again for sure and will remember the truly warm hospitality.  You won't regret your stay."
March 2012,Awesome hotel and apartments-brilliant!!!,"Just returned from April holiday visiting our son who is studying at King's College this semester. We rented an apartment at the hotel-which truly surpassed our expectations. The apartment was beautiful, with magnificently appointed rooms for ourselves and  two of our children- ages 18 and 15. We also had a lovely living/sitting room where we could read, relax, watch movies, visit with our older son and his girlfriend, etc. The kitchen came already stocked with juice, milk, coffee/tea, cereals, yogurt and fresh fruit. The staff is amazing- kind, helpful, hospitable--you truly feel ""at home"", welcome and part of the family. They are solution oriented--  if your college junior decides on the spur of the moment that he wants to sleep over- they have a comfortable bed set up in the…"
April 2012,"Fantastic afternoon high tea, very classy!","I went there with a bunch of friends for afternoon high-tea. I didnt actually pay for the high tea so i can't tell you how much it cost. There were scones with whipped butter and jam. Prawn mayo sandwich (I think), tuna sandwich, ham and cheese sandwich. There are sweets ranging from cheesecake, strawberry cheesecake, fruit tartlets and etc. They were all very yummy and if you want a classy, high-class and girly high-tea with your girly friends, this is the right place.  After the high-tea, there were complimentary cocktails which i think its pretty standard.   The service from the waiter was very good, toilets are clean and atmosphere was very good too.  Please click YES if you think this review is helpful."
April 2012,Best Hotel ever,"I stayed there with my family (wife and three kids 2,4,9) over the easter weekend and i never had a better one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanx to the whole staff, they´ve been so nice and everything was perfect!  The best Hotel ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Michael"
January 2012,Exceptional hotel with a level of service that was all but forgotten...,"My family recently had the pleasure of staying at the Milestone Hotel in the Kensignton area of London.  In all our years of traveling, we have had the opportunity to stay at several high quality hotel establishments including the Ritz, Four Seasons, Cloister at Sea Island, Sanctuary at Kiawah Island and the Breakers in Palm Beach.  However, we have never had an experience quite like the Milestone.  The entire staff from the front desk, to the doormen to the concierge went above and beyond our expectations.  The staff covered every request with genuine courtesy, precision and the utmost professionalism.  More importantly, they made our daughters feel special each and every day.  The highlight of our stay was an afternoon tea that will remain in our hearts for years to come.  The…"
March 2012,Almost an 'excellent',"I do not dish out the 'excellent' badge very often,  but came close this time.  This is a top class hotel,  whilst remaining to be a little quirky and British.  No fancy palm filled atrium here,  but some nice cosy snugs and other little hideaways.  Aims to provide impeccable service,  and came rather close.  My only complaint was that the cooked breakfast really was made to order,  possibly even sourced to order,  as it did not arrive in time for me to eat it.  Breakfast here is clearly to be enjoyed at a more leisurely pace than I could afford."
December 2011,Impeccable Service,"This was my third stay at the Milestone and I am happy to say it did not disappoint. It is in a terrific location right across from Kensington Gardens, it has a wonderful classic London feel - but what really sets it apart is the impeccable service. Each and every person I came into contact with provided excellent service - and it is done in a truly genuine and friendly manner. They make you feel welcome and taken care of - and after a long day it was like coming home.  The hotel itself is very nice ( and I am a picky traveler!) , the restaurant and amenities quite lovely - but the service is something that you just don't get at the other fine hotels. The Milestone is definately the choice I will make on my next trip to London."
November 2011,Exellent,"My wife and I have just returned home after spending a fantastic weekend at The Milestone. From the moment you walk in you get a level of service that we have never experiensed before at any other hotel. And it lasted until the moment we left. We stayed in a junior suite and it was amazing. We are not able to point out one negative experiense from our stay so the next time we go to London we will not spend time looking for alternatives, we will stay at The Milestone."
October 2011,Very English,"The hotel was a good 5* experience but we did not like the smallness of the old English style of the hotel. Our junior suite was smaller than executive rooms in most 5* hotels that we normally stay in. Thus the value for money satisfaction was not there. On Sunday morning the breakfast was also slow and the service inadequate, mostly because the whole restaurant had only two waitors."
May 2011,The best hotel in the best city in the world,"Have been at The Milestone Hotel was one of the best experiences of my life, the attention of the staff is excellent, went to celebrate my birthday but my astonishment surpassed expectation, the best service, my room more beautiful and comfortable, wonderful!, food, first and delicious, the ability to read the newspaper to the fireplace makes The Milestone Hotel is just a warm place, a place where one can feel much better than in our own home.  I have only words of thanks for the wonderful days spent in London at the best hotel in the best city in the world!"
November 2011,Beautiful Hotel:,"I stayed with Friends at the Milestone Hotel and we all had just the most wonderful experience of""English Hospitality"" The rooms are magnificent, Food  is delicious and the Staff are just amazing....absolutely the best. We all felt so special and any help we needed with trips,directions etc was attended to in a most helpful manner.  We all hope to return to the Milestone again."
November 2011,Nothing is too much trouble,"Had a wonderful weekend at the Milestone with my daughter on our first mum and daughter weekend shopping for her birthday. Staff  made us very welcome, all knowing my name. we had pre booked  tickets to see The Lion King that evening which were brought to our room.  (good seats) Had a burger in the lounge which was really good, we didn't have afternoon tea but it looked amazing.  Next day we had a full day shopping on our return there was a much needed pamper pack left in our room. Bath soak, foot scrub and face mask.. bliss.   Breakfast was good service again fantastic.   Our room also had homemade cookies which were soon tasted. Penhaligon products which smelt lovely.   On departure our bags were looked after until we headed to the airport.   5 service"
November 2011,Perfect service,The staff was courteous and very helpful.  Always on the job.  This was a truly 5-star experience.  The rooms were pretty and there were a lot of nice touches from the cookies & prunes that greeted us to the fancy Penhaligon bath products.  Room service delivered tasty food quickly at 1am.  The staff anticipated our needs and gave us a tour of the hotel & also pointed out things of interest in the neighborhood.  The bed was very comfortable.
November 2011,Great hotel,Enjoyed a nice stay here  Food was great as was hospitality
October 2011,Like a vintage bottle of wine.,"If you go to the The Milestone Hotel expecting an Ian Schager like experience with Armani Clad staff whispering into wrist microphones to maintenance the moment there is a finger print on an Elevator button you are going to be disappointed, however if you expect an extremely classy while managing to stay informal and highly personal experience of a quintessentially British hotel with tremendous history and impeccable service, then you are in for a treat.  One could be critical at first glances, but then you would be completely missing the point. This is a boutique hotel located in a premium area and innovative architecture and design have extracted beauty from every one of those precious square feet.  From the moment you walk in staff are attentive, but more importantly…"
October 2011,You’ll get what you pay for!,"A truly 5-star is definitely here. We had a memorable noble life in The Milestone a couple of weeks ago. Our superior  room is designed with the luxurious English living style with antique furniture with lots of artwork and small brilliant details in every inch of the room. The staff are professional and very helpful in case we need anything. The restaurant below serves the exact standards of what so-called “fine dining”. Everything, of course, was pricey but it worths nothing for the benefits and comfort we gained during our stay. The only hardest thing to do is spend our most in this all-the-best-in-one-place hotel like this!"
July 2011,"Beautiful hotel, great service","We had a great stay at the Milestone. It is very tastefully done (we were in the ""Jungle Room"") and offers truly exceptional service. The neighborhood is very nice although with all the construction going on in London for the Olympics, taxi service to the major attractions like the Tower is both slow and expensive. Overall a great hotel worthy of the high rankings it receives."
September 2011,excellent place to stay,On arrival at the Milestone we were greeted by very friendly concierge staff who quickly organised our rooms and luggage. The junior suite had excellent taste and decor. The rooms had everything to make our stay comfitable. What made our stay enjoyable was the personel touches like the turn back of the bed with a book and book light together with chocolates on the pillows.The bathroom was filled with luxurious cosmetics of excellent taste. We have stayed at several 5* hotels in the city centre for conveniance but in our opinion nothing compares to the service and little extras provided at the Milestaone. My wife felt like a celebrity.  The hotel has an excellent view of Kennington Palace and Hyde Park. Keep up the good work.
October 2011,Service the old London way,"We arrived at The Milestone Hotel on September 10th  From the time we stepped from our cab until we were bid farewell at 7pm on September 13th, The service we received from your professional ,friendly staff was nothing less than outstanding.   Your hotel was recommended to us by our Travel Agent- James Irving of MTA Travel -Robina Queensland Australia James has been handling our travel arrangements for over 20 years and is very aware of our needs. The Milestone certainly measured up to our expectations and more. The staff, from the Door ,Reception, Bar,Restaurants,Service to room are all to be congratulated for their excellent service. A family member surprised us by booking into your hotel for 2 nights. We knew we had a very good package deal organised by James. I approached…"
June 2012,Amazing Afternoon Tea at Milestone Hotel,We stayed at The Milestone in early October and very much enjoyed the whole experience.  The public rooms are so beautiful and we were treated to a tour of the building after enjoying a welcome glass of champagne on arrival.  We enjoyed a pre-theatre dinner in the restaurant (which we had to ourselves) and it was really excellent.  Our room was a little on the small side but exquisitely furnished with a beautiful bathroom.   Unfortunately a carpenter was working on the conservatory roof outside our room in the afternoon when we wanted to take a short nap but we understand that maintenance has to be done at some time!  That was certainly the only negative.  The service was superb and all the staff bent over backwards to make sure we really enjoyed our stay.
June 2012,Hotel Gem,"I had a delightful experience of afternoon tea at the Milestone Hotel this afternoon. I'm a big fan of afternoon tea and had to write a review on here for this one.  I visited the hotel with my brother and other cousins today. We decided to visit early (1pm sitting). The sitting finished at 2.45pm which offered ample time for us to enjoy the experience and the gorgeous food.  The service was excellent. Right from the moment we stepping into the hotel, we were made to feel special without overdoing it. The small, intimate room that is used for afternoon tea is delightful. We were seating on comfortable sofa.  I selected a peppermint tea and enjoyed a selection of sandwiches, cakes, tarts, pasties and more. The waitress that served us was courteous and nothing was too much…"
April 2012,Incredible attention to detail,"Perfect hotel experience in the heart of Kensington!  Staff couldn't have done enough-rooms were beautiful, comfortable and spotless.  Cannot wait to return!"
June 2012,Wonderful hotel in good location,"This is my favourite place to stay in London. It's hard to find anything to criticise.  The hotel is just the right size. Small enough to be personal, but big enough to have a proper restaurant (and room service) and its own small (but functional) gym.  Service here is both extremely competent and friendly.  They pay incredible attention to the smallest details. Two tiny examples I remember: in the desk they put a complete set of office supplies (paper clips, scissors etc); when leaving for the airport, they offered a couple of small bottles of Evian water to take with us.  I also appreciate having free wifi.  Almost the only annoyance in the hotel is that their third-party WiFi system requires you to login with a username and password each time you use it, rather than using a…"
January 2012,Simply the best hotel we have ever stayed in,"This is a very beautiful hotel, wonderfully situated and really quite perfect.  Every single member of staff made us feel very welcome, and all the little touches that set this hotel apart were very much appreciated.  I would recommend The Milestone without hesitation, and cannot wait to return and stay a little longer; one night was not enough!"
January 2012,another great stay,"Just returned from another great stay at The Milestone - was traveling to London alone this time and booked a queen bedded room- I was given a beautiful king room facing Kensington Gardens- the desk was situated in a dormer with a round window- just a great space to use my computer-internet connection is excellent- again, wonderful, friendly service- also The Milestone is kid friendly - my 2 year old grandson comes to visit and he always gets a warm welcome plus the doormen lift the stroller up and down the stairs with nice greeting and a smile"
November 2011,Afternoon Tea,"I  highly recommend The Milestone  Champagne Afternoon Tea.  A selection of finger sandwiches and freshly baked scones with Devonshire clotted cream with a pot of tea of your choice, starting with a bottle of chilled Champagne in historical and elegant surroundings.  You don't have to stay in the hotel, but wisely book a table.  You will never forget you went there! 2 minutes walk from Kensington High Street!"
February 2011,Unique Boutique across form the Palace,"This hotel was recommended by an English friend and was his residence when he sold his house (there are also apartments here ). Very low key, understated elegance and staff. I had a beautiful room facing Kensington Palace and the street but it was fairly quiet though a little cramped with a view of the lawn. My friend took a basement room that had a large dressing area for her and her daughters. Nice size but one small window. The food was good and the rate included breakfast and some other perks at the time. This is owned by the Red Carnation group who has several hotels in London. Located on the High Street with a Whole foods and branch store of top shop in Kensington. If you want to feel like a very pampered resident, across from the Duke and Duchess then this is the place…"
January 2012,Tea at The Milestone - a very English experience,"If you've been following my other reviews on The Milestone it will come as no surprise to you to learn that the afternoon tea at The Milestone is also a very pleasant affair. We opted to have a glass of Champagne before we started on the tea itself and used this moment to take in our surroundings whilst we sipped the Champagne from the stylish tulip style Champagne glasses The Milestone uses. The nicest part about the lounge atmosphere at The Milestone is that it's like being invited by the owner of a period house to tea in his personal library - complete with roaring log fire. The Lounge here is not big so you'd definitely need to book ahead to be sure of securing a place. There is an extensive tea menu, so there will definitely be a tea to suit everyone's mood. The sandwiches…"
December 2011,Truly a wonderful experience,"Our first time at The Milestone Hotel and truly a wonderful experience. Very good service with attention to details. A luxurious but cosy atmosphere, you feel at home the moment you enter the hotel. We stayed in a deluxe king bedroom (couple and child 7 y.o.). Great breakfast and afternoon tea. Kind attention for our child."
June 2012,Rooms are way to small,The service here is very nice. They will only change 500 pounds a day and for some that may be an issue. While I have absolutely no idea how the pack so much stuff in the rooms that are entirely too small. If you are less than 5 ft tall the shower will work great for you!  We moved to the ritz after two nights. Couldn't take it any longer 
May 2012,You should book this hotel if you would like to enjoy the best of London,"A wonderful warm and welcome English London Hotel. A very good choice for those who like to feel cared for and comfortable. We stayed over the jubilee weekend and had a lovely time.  The service is impeccable, nothing is too much trouble and we found every single member of staff to be kind and genuinely helpful. They continuously looked for ways to make our stay memorable and to anticipate any needs we may have had ~ a rare commodity. The English charm and beauty of the hotel will make for a very authentic stay for guests who are not British and are in the UK to sample the culture and enjoy London. It is a charming hotel overlooking Kensington gardens in a very quiet and peaceful area of London. London can be busy and demanding and exciting, and it is very nice to retire to the…"
May 2012,Best Hotel In London,"If you want to stay at the best hotel in London, this is it! Service is fantastic, they do everything that they say they can and will do, the staff is always thinking ahead and the rooms are beautiful. Close to almost everything and within walking distance to Harrod's and many terrific pubs/restaurants. I can't wait to go back! SWP, Scottsdale, AZ"
June 2012,comfort and elegance,"Even though we only had an overnite,  we were boarding a cruise ship in southhampton the following day, this was a most enjoyable interlude.  The hotel is charming and well kept, but I think the overwhelming asset it has is the service.  The concierge Jose is superb; very helpful and never a negative response to any request. We were a party of five (3 rooms) and each  room, though not large was very well tended.  The breakfast offered was delious and offered a nice variety; we  had dinner as well, but because it was part of an inclusion with platinum american express the menu was quite limited. The location is terrific, walk up a few blocks and there is a whole foods supermarket , of course there is kensington park.  This hotel defintely bears a repeat!"
May 2012,Made me feel like a Queen!,"Very special place to stay.  It is pricey, but every detail is taken care of.  Friendly staff, called us by name after one day there.  Wonderful food, bar, and facility.  The location is just across from the park, near buses and tube stations.  Shopping nearby."
April 2012,Simply the best,"Truthfully there is no better hotel in London, the quality of the staff, the service in the public areas is quite exceptional. As for the rooms I have stayed in numerous , they all have amazing quality, and quite simply everything you could wish for, and a touch more! a wonderful find and my home away from home, if only I could live there!"
December 2011,Quiet - Next to Kensington Park,The Milestone Hotel was a pleasant discovery. Small but comfortable rooms with impeccable service. Lovely bathroom. The restaurant had excellent food and a homely atmosphere. A place to relax after a busy day. I'll definitely return. Elizabeth S. Rasmussen Oslo
September 2011,Very nearly excellent,"Having previously stayed at sister properties 41 Hotel, Rubens, and most recently at Egerton House Hotel, this hotel was very good, clearly five star calibre, but we did not have the same consistently exceptional experiences as we did at 41 and Egerton. Perhaps it was because we were staying over Christmas, but more on that to come. First, the positives...  Positives: Milestone Hotel is in a wonderful location, right across from Hyde Park and just down the street from all the great shopping in Kensington. There are several of the city bike rental stations nearby (highly recommended for exploring the parks). The hotel is beautiful and historic, with very impressive common areas; the lounge and conservatory are especially cozy. When we arrived, we were greeted with glasses of…"
October 2011,Treated like royalty,My wife and I recently spent a week at the Milestone Hotel in London. Our expectations were very high given the comments we had read but they managed to exceed even those lofty expectations. For the second we walked through the door we felt incredibly welcomed and pampered. Can't wait to go back.
June 2011,so english,"My mother was French and I always say in Paris I am happy and in London I feel virtuous and civilized.My husband got sick upon arriving at the airport and the hotel's car stood with us for 4 hours while he went to hospital ,taking us back to heathrow airport to pick up his passport,I must say Collin the driver was the perfect person to have on your side at a moment like this.Fortunately there was nothing serious and we enjoyed our stay at this very professional hotel who even sent me a box of chocolate for my birthday.I even felt happy in London.The neighborhood and the staff did it"
October 2011,"A ""Sanctuary"" in a busy city","I should have written this sooner but we have just returned from extensive traveling.  We stayed at the Milestone on the recommendation of our son and daughter-in-law, as well as our good friend, who is a Virtuoso travel agent.  The overall experience was that of visiting a grand house, with a staff that is most eager to make sure that each guest is treated as if he or she is the only one to be served.  Our children joined us along with their 8 year old daughter.  We are all particularly thankful for the most delicious tea that was served to us in the dining room upon our arrival - a bit outside the normal service time.  The cucumber sandwiches were the best I have ever eaten.  (...and this coming from a lady from the South who has eaten cucumber tea sandwiches since she was…"
October 2011,What a delight,"Recently I have had the chance of staying at the Milestone and must say.. what I delight!! From the comfy bed to the great amenities.. The service is excellent, all staff was helpful, professional and genuinely nice (special thanks to Pedro, the butler!). I also enjoyed some relaxing and cosy moment in the living room (with a beautiful decoration and fireplace) while I had a bite. The wifi is free and easy to connect, always useful! Location was perfect, with the park, shops and metro around the hotel. Loved the luxurious feeling while feeling like ‘at home’. Next time, I’ll need to enjoy the pool and the famous afternoon tea!"
August 2011,"Perfection, Fabulous...Simply the best !!!","From the moment we booked, the Milestone was different !! and from the moment we arrived we knew the Milestone was really special. The service on arrival was the best I have ever come across. I have stayed in numerous hotels on both business and pleasure and have never come across service like this before. We were offered champagne on arrival which was gorgeous, the room was beautiful, the bed was big and luxurious,the bathroom was fantastic ;the shower was a rain shower fitted into the ceiling ; wonderful....  We were going to the Albert Hall in the evening and the team at the hotel took time to take an interest in what were doing, which was lovely considering all the other guests they had. Nothing was too much trouble, in fact you really felt as if they were really enjoying…"
September 2011,Experience London in elegant style,"My husband, 11 year-old-son and I visited the Milestone this past August. I had spent a lot of time in London before, but, until this stay, had never quite experienced the ultimate in white glove service and old-world charm as is offered at the Milestone! I am fairly well-travelled and very discerning...the type who checks out several rooms before settling in to one; the potentially annoying never-quite-satisfied type...I admit it! That being said [and I DID take our assigned butler's offer of viewing several rooms before choosing one], I was beyond delighted with my stay at the Milestone. From the moment we walked into the lush, traditional lobby, after a delayed red-eye flight from New York, we were embraced with smiles, service and an easy gentility that made for the perfect…"
August 2011,Best Hotel to date,"We were a group of four from age 53 to 75. Seemed a very quite hotel. Fantastic mattress. Had a lot of little extras. Everything you would need. Champagne on arrival.  Also had afternoon tea, which was very filling.  Went in small swimming pool which was clean and not to deep. Still able to swim up and down. Opposite Kensington gardens, which is lovely to walk around. Approx £7.50 to £11 from Victoria Station to Hotel via taxi.  Staff friendly and seemed well aware of what we may like etc. Breakfast fresh and lovely, plenty of it. Can't wait to be able to go back again.  Mr Williams, Ms Brewer, Ms J Creasey, Ms G Creasey"
September 2011,A great  experience,"My wife  and  I  stayed at The Mileston Hotel  August 6-9, 2011.  The  service  was outstanding.  Great  front  desk  staff, wonderful  concierge and doormen.  Very personable  and  friendly.  The location, next  to  Kensington Park, creates  easy  access to  most  of  the  areas  we  needed  to  visit. Very good  food  and  drink.  I  highly  reccomend the  Milestone Hotel  Ariel leibovitz"
September 2011,Cozy feel and great staff,"We stayed for 4 nights in a Superior Queen room and had a marvelous stay.  The staff was very friendly, professional, and quite attentive to our needs.  The hotel has that ""old English charm"" yet the rooms are wonderfully up to date.  The room we stayed in was a little tight at times especially when unpacking/packing.  Room service posed a ""spacial"" challenge when my wife and I tried to share breakfast in the room but the amenities were all there including iron w/ ironing board, hairdryer, and in-room safe.  We would definitely stay there again but might try the King room next time."
October 2011,Best Hotel In the World,"My wife and I love to travel.  In fact, we have been to 30 countries within the last nine years.  We have experienced every level of hotel.  However, the Milestone Hotel in London, without a doubt is the finest Hotel we have ever stayed in.  The service is the very best.  The staff is the very best, the food is the very best,  My wife stated that she never wanted to leave.  She would have moved in if we could have.  We will always recommend the Milestone to all of our friends and we will certainly return to the Milestone every trip to England.  We love England and we have visited there on five other trips and we will return.  Thank you for allowing us to share our experence."
March 2012,A private club with no attitude,"Although it is a bit pricey, Milestone delivers a real personal touch in a fine environment.   The head guy in the restaurant has endless stories about this and that-----the breakfast is great (excellent scottish smoked salmon)----location is great too.   The rooms are fine, very comfortable and well kept, but nothing extraordinary when compared to other hotels of this category."
January 2012,Suite is the way to go,"We have just returned from our weekend trip to London, we enjoyed it very much.  The hotel was so friendly and not at all stuffy, people were engaging and genuinely interested in anything they could help you with.  The room we had was a suite and it was truly spectacular even down to the candlelit bathroom.  The room overlooked the park, so when booking its best to ask for a room that over looks the Park, as some can look onto the conservatory which can be a bit noisy at times.  As regards to the food, if I am honest we were not impressed at all, very expensive and all quite cold.  breakfast was really nice, so if you I were you I would use the facilities this hotel has to offer but eat elsewhere after all you are in London tons to choose from.  Overall definitely visit again."
February 2012,A special treat,"We'd previously stayed at the Milestone for a show in the Royal Albert Hall in 2010 and when I was looking for a special treat for my wife a few months after the arrival of our baby in November 2011, I knew the Milestone would be the perfect place. It sounds like a cliche but from the very moment you arrive at the entrance, you are made feel completely welcome by everyone in a genuine, warm-hearted manner. The attention from then until the moment you leave is like no other hotel I have ever stayed in without ever being over-bearing. We especially loved the little touches in the room when we returned to it after our dinner. We would come to London especially just to stay here."
February 2012,5* luxury - making a special occasion even more special!,"We stayed at The Milestone in February for one night, as part of a surprise birthday getaway which my husband organised.  We stayed in a deluxe double room (no. 310) which, being on the third floor and on the front of the hotel, had great views over Hyde Park.  We weren't aware of any traffic noise at all - very quiet.  The room was spacious and clean with a wonderful en-suite bathroom.  Free wi-fi in your room.  Fruit platter and welcome drink on arrival plus an informative tour of the hotel.  We didn't stay for afternoon tea as we were dashing off to the theatre, but we have had afternoon tea at The Milestone before and I would highly recommend it - a wonderful experience.  Nearest tube station is High Street Kensington (just 5 mins walk away), or the hotel will organise taxis…"
January 2012,The best afternoon-tea ever,"I was looking for a nice and traditional place to have afternoon-tea in London and I found The Milestone on the list of the Top London Tea Place Awards 2011.  So I was sure I was going to find something very nice.  And The Milestone has by far exceeded my expectations. I had the best afternoon-tea ever! The room where the afternoon-tea takes place is a very beautiful room, with a magnificent decoration. I was seated in the Library where I had the feeling that time had stopped.  I had a very nice view on Kensington gardens.  The food itself was absolutely fantastic.  I am looking forward to go back and I don't want to have afternoon tea somewhere else in London now.  I also had the chance to visit the hotel. The rooms are nicely decorated.  Every room is decorated in a different…"
December 2011,MAGNIFICENT MILESTONE STAY,"Stayed at Hotel 41 for four days before a cruise out of Southampton.  On the return, we stayed three nights at The Milestone including New Year's Eve.  We were so spoiled at Hotel 41 that we thought there was no way The Milestone could compare.  Well it did nicely.  We did not have that one on one feeling with staff like Hotel 41 but the staff at The Milestone was excellent.  The concierge spent time with us arranging a trip to Paris.  He took his time, booked the train tickets and printed them.  Whenever we needed to make or change a dinner reservation he did it with total class.  The bell staff was also very polite and they all seemed to know our name.  Our room at The Milestone was magnificent!!  Probably the nicest hotel room I have ever experienced.  Think it was the Tudor…"
December 2011,Our luxurious home from home in London,"We stayed at Milestone for five nights at Christmas, from 23 to 28 December, and we had our Christmas Eve Dinner and Christmas Day Lunch in Cheneston’s restaurant. This was our second stay at the hotel, and we had a perfect Christmas away from home. We loved every minute of it, and we have already booked our third stay in February 2012.  We have travelled quite a lot all over Europe, and we have visited several five star hotels. Milestone is by far the best of them, with warmth, personal service and a welcoming kindness that we have never found anywhere else. London is our favourite town, and Milestone is our favourite hotel.   We will recommend general manager Andrew Pike and his lovely staff in a wonderful Kensington building."
December 2011,Truly a home away from home...Outstanding!!,"My wife and I stayed at the Milestone Hotel for nine nights over the Christmas and New Year holiday.  I cannot say enough about the management, staff and hotel in general.  Without exception, every staff member treated us with the utmost respect and really, really seemed to care about our needs.    We initially had some concerns about staying in a hotel on Christmas Day but the Milestone and its staff made it a wonderful (and very memorable) day.  The day started by us finding a Christmas stocking with wrapped presents attached to our hotel room door on Christmas morning...then we had a fabulous full English breakfast in our room followed that evening by an outstanding dinner in Cheneston's Restaurant...finally, we capped off this great day with evening tea in the library (which…"
December 2011,Fantastic 50th Birthday Surprise!,"We stayed here in December for husbands 50th birthday.  He had no idea where we where going, everything had been booked and arranged in secret, and i am pleased to say, we both had a fantastic time.  All the staff are very friendly and helpful, nice touch to be called by your name, and also remembering what you had to drink the night before when ordering a drink the next evening. The staff we found, are about when required, and very helpful and friendly, not constantly hounding you!   Suite was beautiful, well equipped, romantic turndown was beautiful, and all the other little touches left in the room both nights.  Food was good, breakfast was beautiful, did have to wait for a table on the sunday morning, but not for long, maybe only 5 mins, so not a problem at all, nice chance…"
April 2012,The most supurb afternoon tea,"I had the pleasure of having afternoon tea with my fiance' and parents before going to Royal Albert Hall for a Christmas concert.  The Milestone had won the the Top London Tea Place awards of 2011, so I was curious if it had truly deserved this honour.  The hotel itself was absolutely divine.  Interiors of a high quality and very welcoming staff. The room in which the afternoon tea was served was was just the right size and very cozy and warm.  The environment was tranquil, peaceful and very civilized. It really is a place to enjoy the comforts of British food culture with good company.    The afternoon tea itself was of a very high quality and the presentation was immaculate.   The Milestone truly deserved its win in 2011 and I'm sure will continue to keep its reputation as the…"
February 2012,Service and Location is why I would stay here again but..,"We stayed five days, and every single day without fail all of our needs were met and them some. Our park view was lovely but the Internet service that they say is free is horrible if not impossible to use. You have to keep putting in your specific long winded code and you get bumped if you stay on it. In our room 409 we had a telephone shower, which wasn't what we had hope for, at the price of our stay. The toilet if you flushed it once would run for a long time and not flush again for quite a while. So you can imagine if two people have to really use the Jon. I prepaid for the trip and asked if my trip could be paid with out being converted into pounds, the booker said yes. When the will came in over 86 dollars was added by Amex because they used their conversion service to…"
March 2012,Wonderful Gem in The Kensington Area,"My husband and I were looking for a hotel in the Kensington area to be near our son who is attending an abroad program. We also wanted a hotel with an indoor pool. Previously we have stayed at the Berkeley and the Savoy, both wonderful hotels so we were taking a chance, but were not disappointed. We have now stayed at The Milestone twice in February and are returning in April. It is a lovely gem, small with a lot of character, and wonderful service. It has a thoroughly British, almost Victorian flair and reminds me of the Lowell in New York in terms of size, comfort and service.  We had two different junior suites, The Venetian and The Harlequin. We preferred the layout of the Harlequin but both were lovely. Room service in the morning was exactly on time. We highly recommend…"
March 2012,Wonderful!,"This is an excellent hotel, we enjoyed every minute and had a smile on our faces all day long. It was such a treat to stay here in a friendly and luxurious but still relaxed atmosphere. The salmon at breakfast and the chicken sandwich at afternoon tea were divine."
March 2012,High standards all round,"My wife and I had a three day break here a couple of weeks ago and really enjoyed it.  It doesn't have the enormous public areas and rooms of some London hotels: instead it is 'compact and bijou' along the lines of old Edwardian London clubs, which gives it a nostalgic cozy air that suits us just fine.  We ate out for two nights and only took one dinner at the hotel.  It's usual to explore different nearby eateries when staying at a hotel, but I highly recommend taking at least one dinner here - the cuisine is first class in every way and the service and ambience top notch.  At breakfast on the first morning we experienced a calamity of major proportions when a waitress in training spilled the entire contents of the tea and hot water pots as she endeavoured to place them from…"
March 2012,Impecable Service Levels,"I haven't contributed here for a long time but this charming hotel has encouraged me to review again. The hotel is very handsome both inside and out with fabulous views over Kensington Gardens but it's most outstanding element is the very personal levels of service.  The hotel feels intimate and cosy, unusual for central London. The staff are extremely friendly, helpful and efficient.  The rooms whilst not huge are richly decorated and unique.   Breakfast is good though the dining room is a little twee for me. The Stables Bar is minute but pleasant for a post theatre drink and you can overspill into the lovely Conservatory. And a great location for the Royal Albert Hall.  All in all, delightful."
August 2011,Near Perfection!,"My family and I recently stayed at the Milestone, and we could not have been more pleased.  A smaller hotel located right in the heart of Kensington, it was in a very convenient place, which made sightseeing easy.  We had two suites, which were quite large and accommodating.  They were also most clean and neat, and there were some nice little touches, such as a plate of small fruits provided every evening. I was most impressed with the level of service, which was impeccable.  All members of the hotel staff knew us by name, were solicitous of our needs, and were always most polite.  Not even my sometimes-rambunctious 9 year old could rattle them, and their courtesy was always extended to my children, which was most appreciated.     The hotel has a wonderful and renowned…"
March 2012,Fabulous Experience,Stayed here for a week last August for a girls trip with my young daughters and the service and accommodations could not have been better. Both Neil at the front desk and Neil the concierge were incredibly helpful and Pedro gave the kids a wonderful tour that was part of the family package we booked. We had a wonderful dinner in cheneston's one night with my parents who were visiting at the same time - highly recommend the Dover Sole! This trip was a very special splurge for us and this hotel did not disappoint.
March 2012,Excellent Boutique Hotel,"I travel every week to London and it's been a very pleasant surprise to discover The Milestone. Excellent service, taking care of every need. Good restaurant also, including an amazing wine list. Finally, the location is perfect. Will repeat."
July 2011,Great service,"This hotel is a luxurious place to stay. The facilities are excellent which include a pool and a gym. The staff could not have been better and pedro the butler was great showing us round the hotel and resolving any issues. The area could not be better near hyde park, the tube and museums. A big thanks to all the staff and I could not thing of anything bad about the hotel. We would recommend this hotel and will come back in the future."
September 2011,Excellent !!!!!,"We stayed last year for one week with our two kids and it was the best experience.  Alexandra ,the receptionist, was very helpful and very nice , but most important , very professional.  Location is unbeatable and restaurant was wonderful."
September 2011,Phenomenal experience,"The service we experienced far exceeded our already high expectations created by the prior reviews. Their attention to detail began upon confirmation of the reservation when they asked for details such as type of pillow etc to ensure our stay would be as memorable as possible.  The conceirge was very helpful and courteous and all the other staff were highly attentive at all times. I believe this is what distinguishes this hotel from many other fine 5 star establishments in London. The room's decor was full of character and added to the uniqueness of the experience. On a balanced note their irish coffees could have been more generous in size, given their cost."
September 2011,A Special Place,"Our September 2011 visit to London was wonderful. An important part of our successful trip was choosing the Milestone Hotel as our place to stay while in London. It is a charming hotel with a dedicated staff who work very hard to make sure their guests are happy. My wife and I selected a basic room. The room was charming albeit a trifle small for two people. However the bathroom was very spacious with excellent amenities. My wife and I loved the decor of the entire hotel which is warm, comfortable and pleasing to the eye. We did not choose to have breakfast included but we did have one breakfast at the hotel and it was very good. If you are looking for a small and intimate hotel in London, that provides first rate service, stay at the Milestone. I'm sure that you will not be…"
September 2011,I `ll be back,This is properly best hotel I never have visit in the whole world. Everything went so easy. First from the booking of the hotel to the in-checking etc. It is a very professional hotel and everything went 100% on our 5 days visit there. We had a large room and properly the largest bathroom I ever have seen. It is so nice inside and so clean. The staff are brilliant and you just can`t get a better location in London. It is so near everything. Yes it is expensive but it is worth the price.
September 2011,We got there in the end...,"My wife and I spent 3 nights in the Margaret Rose room to celebrate her 40th birthday.  First the bad news: initial thoughts were a little underwhelming given the hasslefree booking process (thanks to Marietta) as many of the small things we had stipulated on the client preferences form were not available or fell short of expectation (a birthday card for me rather than my wife!, pre-loaded iPod, morning newspaper, welcome fruit plate, replacement in-room tea tray, no sound from the DVD player etc..).  Although these are only minor shortcomings they are shortcomings nevertheless and it appeared that the hotel was not managing our high expectations.  Now the good news:  On listening to our issues (Stephanie, Frits etc) the hotel was uncompromising in trying to make up for our…"
July 2011,My wife and I loved it all!!!,"Our trip from Sept-4 to 7th I have been to Europe several times but this was my first trio with my wife. It is difficult to pick the first hotel of your stay because you want it to be memorable. After reading all the ratings we settled on the Milestone. It is in a great location, you can walk, take the bus or the train conveniently to any location. The breakfast was excellent and we found the staff extremely accommodating. Diner was the best meal we had in 15 days in Europe with the exception of Guy Savoy in Paris. We had the special 7 course sampler the food was excellent and the atmosphere and banter with the staff was fun. We were in the safari suite which was fantastic.  The Concierge services were right on point and very helpful. The front desk staff was pleasant in every…"
September 2011,Tops!!!!,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Milestone.  Perfect location. The staff was warm, friendly and they all had a wonderful sense of humor. We hope to return someday. "
May 2011,Consistently Outstanding,"Our second visit to the Milestone.  I can't say enough about how good this hotel is.  Neil, the Assistant Concierge is amazing.  He goes above and beyond to be sure guests are well taken care of.  Everyone else on the staff is totally guest focused.  Pedro and Graham were delightful.  Our dinner at Chenestons was perfect.  The room was lovely and well appointed.  We will be back again!"
August 2011,Did it live up to my high expectations?  YES !,The staff are very attentive and are highly skilled at what they do. The staff obviously care about the level of service they are providing which is pleasing. That said if you are like me and do not like too much fuss I found them generally perceptive to this. The rooms are lavish and extremely clean. The food in restaurants is excellent as you would expect. Without going into the realms of fantasy about the place I have to say it surpassed my expectations. We had one hiccup during our stay and that was over a breakfast we had requested in our room by way of leaving a notice detailing our order on the door handle. When the allotted time came..no breakfast! I phoned reception to be informed they had not received the order. They were mortified and by the time we ventured…
June 2011,"Not perfect,but close",We normally have stayed in some pretty good London hotels but wanted a change.....and how pleasantly surprised I and my fellow guests were. The management and staff do care and understand who paying their wages. Hope they never forget and keep up the good work...this way they'll keep being head and shoulders above the rest.
December 2011,The warmest welcome I have ever had in London,"we stayed at the Milestone in June 2011, on the final sector of a round-the-world trip.  We had come from Washington DC, where the staff of the hotel had earned a letter from me to the Manager because of their condescending and dismissive attitude.  Coming after this, the Milestone could not have been more of a contrast, and such a welcome contrast at that.  We were greeted very warmly, and shown to our room by the butler, who seemed genuinely concerned that we be truly delighted with our room.  He rang back 15 minutes after he had left, just to be certain. shortly after that, Tea was delivered to our room.  The restaurant was very good, and wine-matching from the excellent cellar was exemplary.    This hotel's greatest asset is the happy, interested and genuinely joyful vibe…"
December 2011,Christmas magic,"We wre back at the Milestone again, and pleased to say thet the 'nightly little problems' (see my previous review) appear to have been resolved. Great breakfasts, tremendous staff and one of the friendliest and knowledgeable Concierges I have met - thanks Jose. Will be back.."
December 2011,Wonderful place to stay.,"We were looking for somewhere special to spend our 10th wedding anniversary and Christmas, we found it at The Milestone. From the moment we walked in the door we knew we'd made the right choice. Everyone we met was so nice and welcomed you like a friend rather than a guest.  The room was big by London standards and the bathroom was also very spacious. We found a bottle of champagne in our room to congratulate us on our anniversary which was a lovely touch and also a birthday card. The bed was huge and the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in!  The rest of the hotel was beautifully decorated and felt warm and cozy. Breakfast was terrific with so many choices we had a different hot breakfast each morning! We didnt have afternoon tea but it looked amazing! Christmas dinner…"
December 2011,The best by far..,"The Milestone is a truly wondeful hotel, my partner and i were made to feel like we were coming home rather than residents of a hotel. Each member of staff took the time to talk to us personally and greeted us by first name, which was a lovely touch. The first time we visited we stayed in a master suite which was spotlessly clean and immaculately presented and overlooking kensington gardens; there was fresh fruit, flowers and champagne..all complimentary in the room upon arrival; the butler gave us a tour of the hotel and facilities and nothing we requested was declined, the level of service was the best either of us (who have travelled extensively) have ever experienced in a hotel. We have also stayed in a deluxe studio suite for an overnight stay and although smaller than the…"
December 2011,Just like being a member of an exclusive club,"As it was to be our last day in London before a long flight home to Australia, my husband and I decided to spend it in a little luxury at the Milestone Hotel.  The hotel was even more than we had imagined with butler service for all and an amazing menu and bar list.  The service was exceptional and the location right in the middle of London.  We would return again and stay longer.  Highly recommended."
December 2011,Superb Hotel!,"My husband and I decided to visit this hotel for our 2nd Wedding Anniversary on 26th December based on trip advisor reviews and we were not dissappointed.  It is in a perfect location close to high street Kensington shops and Hyde Park.    On arrival we checked in and were shown to our room, we stayed in room 206.  The room was beautiful and there was a bottle of champagne waiting for us in our room and an anniversary card.  The room was beautifully decorated and I could not fault it at all.  The service was fantastic.  We parked in a public car park opposite which was £30 for 24 hours, very secure parking and only a short walk from the hotel.   We had afternoon tea which I would highly recommend, the sandwiches, cakes and warm scones were lovely and we were unable to finish…"
December 2011,"Front of house rather snooty and preoccupied Great breakfast, poor dinner","Imaginatively designed and decorated room and impressive balcony. Well equipped too with superb toiletries towelling etc. Very good breakfasts indeed! But dinner was a letdown, but then there were no other dinners. First course skate - very good. Poorly presented Kobe steak (? Was it Kobe?). Ghastly desert in a roll of jelly and glutinous custard. Charming waiting though"
December 2011,Milestone Hotel - Excellent hotel with 5* service 24/7,On arrival at the Milestone we were greeted by very friendly concierge staff who quickly organised our rooms and luggage. The junior suite had excellent taste and decor. The rooms had everything to make our stay comfitable. What made our stay enjoyable was the personel touches like the turn back of the bed with a book and book light together with chocolates on the pillows.The bathroom was filled with luxurious cosmetics of excellent taste. We have stayed at several 5* hotels in the city centre for conveniance but in our opinion nothing compares to the service and little extras provided at the Milestaone. My wife felt like a celebrity.  The hotel has an excellent view of Kennington Palace and Hyde Park. Keep up the good work.
December 2011,WAU but.....,"The Milestone truly is a very nice and chique hotel and the service is nice and the rooms indeed very cozy - i have booked a junior suite and i have to say one thing.... for the price its quite normal you can offer a good service and a nice room - so NO surprise at all instead of that i got a quite normal good service and a quite normal nice room - so value money/value is ok but surely not WAU ! Have been in many hotels in asia/europe/america and got that service (without the small special extras like candles in the bathroom) for a total different price - off course its london ! but but but.... a junior suite where you can't watch tv in your bed (venetian suite)  is quite ""special"", a suite whitout a view anywhere than the court is special again for the price and a suite where…"
December 2011,Wonderful hotel with exceptional service,"We recently had a wonderful family stay at The Milestone Hotel last weekend to celebrate a family birthday party. We were a large party and were accommodated well and even received some complimentary upgrades within our group. On arrival we were met by the very friendly concierge staff who kindly whisked our car away to a local NCP carpark and took our luggage into the hotel to make the arrival extremely seamless. The service in the hotel was very personal and various members of staff stood out as being very genuine and very happy to help, where possible. The rooms were all very individual and included many beautiful and personal touches. The complimentary beauty products in the room were a lovely surprise and you really felt very spoilt and pampered.  I asked for some coffee…"
September 2011,The best hotel experience ever!,"We spent a weekend at The Milestone this December, and due to the ranking of Tripadvisor our expectations were high.The hotel met our expectations by miles- it was great in every way: The room was wonderful, the food delicious, and the staff exellent- they really make you feel welcome and special. The atmosphere at this hotel is special and calm- a place to relax. We had an memorable celebration of our anniversary- the Milestone made it perfect!We will be back and recommend the hotel to everyone who wants to have a delightful stay in London!"
October 2011,Excellent.,My husband and I stayed here for a couple of nights and it was incredibly memorable. Two words: absolute luxury.
October 2011,"Brilliant, absolutley faultless...","unable to fault hotel, staff friendly and attentive but not in your face, hotel very nice, surprisingly quiet, lots of very nice little touches. would highly recommend to anyone staying in London for any purpose."
October 2011,Very good service...but at a price,"We went as an anniversary treat and it didn't dissapoint. It really is a lovely hotel. The service was first rate, the location superb and the breakfasts divine.   But at £400 a night it should be. The set menu dinner that was included in the price was uninspiring, and the lovely sitting area with pianist was effecitively off limits as a private party held sway; the same with Saturday's when afternoon tea takes precedence.   My only complaint is that when you are paying top whack it sticks in the throat to be hideously over charged for 'extras': phone calls £2 a min etc.  There was no kettle or iron in the room but you could pay for pressing and a cup of tea was £5.  I don't begrudge paying for quality - and this hotel is not alone in this practice - but I resent profiteering. …"
September 2011,Deserves more stars!,"A perfect hotel even though we had a brief stay arriving after a long train and leaving the next morning to go home. Wished we could hang around longer and will do so our next visit. Beautiful, great room. Great linens, products. Comfy bed, free Internet! Close to Royal Albert where we went to concert. Fabulous tea. Very helpful friendly staff. All nice people!"
September 2011,the best hotel in london !,"my wife and i , stayed at the milestone hotel for our 3rd wedding anniversary , we had an amazing experience in what is an absolutley beautiful hotel , the best hotel in london by a mile . five star  location - in a lovely area of london facing kensington gardens the hotel is near many of the top tourist attractions such as the royal albert hall and knightsbridge .  the rooms - wow . what can i say ? the room we stayed in was a deluxe studio and although it was expensive , it was amazing , absolutly beautiful. we stayed in room number 426 and it was amazing . the room was decorated beautifully and the bed was very comfy . the room was very spacious , plenty of wardrobe space and a fantastic view of kensington gardens . when i booked the room i asked for the most romantic room…"
September 2011,Melissa first trip to London,"A wonderful london experience.  Their attention to detail is second to none.  Personalized pillow selection, comfortable beds, large bathrooms, tasteful decor, fabulous food, friendly and accomodating staff, intimate settings, delightful different candies each night on your pillow...all made for a wonderful stay in London."
January 2011,Really enjoyed this hotel.,We so enjoyed staying here with my husband. It is close to everyplace you would wish to visit and the staff is so nice. The breakfast was outstanding! After reading all the great reviews we knew we had to stay here!!
September 2011,Superb....!,"Excellent staff, rooms, and service at the Milestone Hotel. Pefect combination of service without snob. Rooms are wonderful with excellent beds and perfectly formed, the bathroom amenities were exclusive. Location is great. Staff are very helpful and professional at all times. Any need is met with timely and high level service. Don't want to rave too much as would like to be able to get a room there in the future! Thanks to all the fantastic staff at the Milestone. I would highly recommend this hotel."
September 2011,Out of 10   - The Milestone is an 11 !!!!!,"The Milestone, in London - England , is a superb hotel!  The entire establishment is extremely clean and the rooms are well-appointed.  The Milestone staff couldn't be more helpful and pleasant.   The concierge, Neil, is brilliant and truly understood the type of restaurant and activities my husband & myself were interested in.  At the finest of restaurants, Neil was able to reserve the best tables for us. Breakfast at The Milestone is a true treat!  The food selection was varied and delicious.  Stefan and Jamal made sure that our early morning food experience was delightful. When we return to London this is the only hotel we will reserve~!!!!  *Interesting, I always complete the surveys provided by hotels at the end of our stay.  The Milestone is the only place in which I…"
July 2011,Good Stop,Wife and I stayed in London for two nights.  The Milestone was our stop.  The rooms were great although typical London small.  Bed was beautiful and bathroom was very nicely arranged.  We hung at the bar for two nights and had lovely service and a great late night burger.  The staff treated us nicely even though we might have had our loud American hat on when we got to conversing with other guests.  They seem to be used to us Yanks needing to stay up a little late since we traveled without an overnight stay.and it was difficult to sleep at 7 PM EDT.  They served us until 1 AM London time while we laughed with a nice couple from Florida.  Had good recommendations for restaurants and it was great to be across the street from the park.
June 2011,The best hotel in London. By a Londoner.,I have stayed in the Milestone many times including the night before my wedding. (now divorced!) The rooms are mostly amazing and the staff always try to upgrade you wherever possible. Im almost certain that there is no other hotel in London that has terraces attached to rooms without upgrading to a huge suite like the Milestone does. I may have just been very lucky in the past though. I konw that alot of the clientele that frequent the Milestone are Americans looking for a slice of England and so that can make the hotel a cliche. I have lived in NYC and am a London native and it is still my hotel of choice. I locked myself out of my apartment last week. I told the taxi to take me straight to the Milestone at 2.30am! They looked up my details on the computer and arranged a great…
July 2011,WOW,"We hadn't been to London for many a year and had the opportunity to go to see Strictly Gershwin at The Royal Albert Hall, so The Milestone proved to be a perfect location for an evening stroll to RAH.    From the moment we arrived it was like an oasis in the busy City, and being opposite Kensington Park was a great bonus to be able to get away from the hustle and bustle of London for a while.  We were greeted with a welcome drink on arrival and given a tour of the hotel and then shown to our upgraded room.  The Hotel really is out of this world and something one can only dream of finding in London, but it really is there.  Service is excellent but unobtrusive, all the staff are polite and helpful and the food is fantastic.  The hotel has such a tranquil ambience from the moment…"
July 2011,Wonderful hotel experience,A recent stay at The Milestone Hotel in London was letter perfect.  The facilities are first class and beautifully maintained.  The staff gets top ratings for both competence and professionalism.  This gem is a home away from home.
July 2011,On a scale of 1-10 we give it an 11!,"I do not even know where to start.  We stayed at the Milestone through the American Express Platinum Fine Hotels Program.  I can only start out by saying, we have traveled all over and have never experienced anything as wonderful as the Milestone.    We arrived many hours before check in time, and our room was not ready.  We received a wonderful upgrade as part of the American Express Program and breakfast each morning, and a free lunch or dinner.  We were given a tour of the hotel, and immediately felt welcomed and for lack of a better description wowed!    We stored our luggage and when we returned, our room was ready and our luggage waiting for us there.  We loved our room, a nice size, comfortable bed, no real view, but quiet.  The shower and bathtub, were a little confusing…"
June 2011,Very Nice if you Fancy the Location,"The hotel is, in fact, wonderful.  From the moment you arrive, till the moment you leave, you are treated fabulously, not in a particularly treacly manner, but more in what is the smallest possible favor we can perform for you.  Its bones are old, so my room configuration was strange, the hallways can leave you claustrophobic in their dimensions, and the dining area must cram many tables into many nooks and crannies, so you, like me, may be treated to high-acoustic inanity from tables bunched close to you.  But if you’re looking for quintessential old-school charming Victorian splendor, you’ve found it here.  The location is great if, for some reason, you have an interest in taking extensive walks through the Western edge of Hyde Park or cruising through the mass of humanity at…"
July 2011,Mixed reaction,"Service and friendliness was outstanding. Truly gracious. However, our room was the tiniest hotel room I have ever stayed in, and we had been upgraded! We ordered room service one nioght and there was no place to park the table, and one of us had to sit in bed to eat. I am mystified as to what closet we might have been in had we not been upgraded. The location is convenient for KP and the Underground. I would have preferred Mayfair or Kensington, which is where we have stayed before. I am not going back, but others might like it."
July 2011,Outstanding,"I will get the one thing off my chest.  It is not the most convenient location, but a lovely one, across from Kensington Gardens.  But the hotel is totally to my liking.  It is atmospheric, but very up to date at the same time.  So the benefits of feeling like royalty are there, along with every modern convenience.  The room furnishings are exquisite and fresh, the service impeccable from the doorman to the front desk to the concierge.  Because everything is there, the rooms feel a bit cramped, even though I was upgraded, I was glad I was alone in the room.  So arrange for the largest room your budget will allow.  The dining room has an excellent chef, the breakfasts are wonderful and the bar a delight.  I had the tea one tired afternoon, and it was very nicely done as well,…"
July 2011,"Nice Hotel a little, felt out of place with our toddler","Great Hotel and Location.  The front desk staff and front desk manager where excellent, would return because of their hospitality.  The staff at breakfast where not so great, maybe because we had our 20 month old along (who is well behaved).  You could hear a pin drop at breakfast, that's how quiet it was in the place, my husband and I were afraid to talk to each other.  Restaurant manager made some offensive comments, while talking to another table. The hotel is directly across from the park which is great if you have kids, although the hotel is not that kid friendly.  Tight hallways, steps leading up to the main entrance, all these things make it harder to navigate with a stroller.  The Hotel is a short walk away from Whole Foods (less than 5 minutes), and the Tube (less than…"
June 2011,Fantastic,The best service we have ever experienced in any hotel anywhere in the world.  Made to feel special from start to finish.
May 2011,One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in,"This was one of the best hotels that I have ever stayed in.  Everything was just perfect.  I took my Granddaughter to Europe for 2 weeks and this was her first experience.  I realize that I have spoiled her, but the experience at the Milestone made the trip more wonderful.  The service was exemplary, and the ambience perfect.  The location was very central for walking, Tube location and other conveniences.  I could not have asked for anything more.  It seemed that the entire staff anticipated your every need and then followed through.  Just wonderful!!!!"
May 2011,"Luxurious London, pampered perfection!","My wife and I stayed for one night as part of a trip to an event at The Royal Albert Hall, (just 5 mins walk down the road). From the minute we arrived we were treated like royalty by the team. The hotel is luxurious and intimate, our room was beautiful and the Afternoon Tea... wow! To Fran and the rest of the amazing staff... thank you, thank you, thank you, and much like Eric Clapton at the RAH... we will be back!"
May 2011,Like a private club,"I've just completed a weekend at the Milestone. All I have to say is perfect. It is very different from other 5 stars hotels I've stayed at and that's what makes the Milestone pretty unique.To the busy, pristine and sometimes cold and impersonal ultra-luxury-wow-factor, the Milestone gives you cosiness, personal touches, and the surprises of the unexpected.  It feels like being in a private club you're a member of from year for every single staff seems to know you and call you by your name. Everybody's so nice.  Every room is different; I don't only talk about the bedrooms but also the lobby, the lounge, the bar, the restaurant. For instance, having a drink at the bar is like going back in time and being in an BBC ""the Avengers"" episode. Staying at the Milestone is like staying…"
May 2011,Wonderful treat even for Londoners,"My fiancee planned a night at the Milestone as a surprise. We live in London and usually go outside of the city and stay in a converted manor home or B&B but we always talk about staying in a quintessential London Hotel. We had an amazing evening. As the evening was a complete surprise, the staff were very helpful arranging everything for him. When we returned from dinner there was a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us----without him even asking. The hotel is also just a short walk from our favorite restaurant, The Launceston Place----amazing food, service, and romantic atmosphere. The next morning was followed by breakfast in bed and champagne. We took a leisurely stroll through the park following breakfast before we returned home.  Although we…"
May 2011,Best personal service hotel,"Just spent 8 days at Milestone, they have 5 apartments if you want to stay over a week, with kitchens and living rooms.  The hotel is traditional english, rooms are small, ditto bathrooms but very pretty and each unique.  Service from the moment you walk in is over the top, they call you by name, no question stumps the Concierge (best one is Jose), but everyone from waiters to housekeepers are fabulous.  Its expensive, for sure, but worth every minute. Location across from Kensington Park and Palace make it more homey feeling.  Be aware, all of London is under construction in anticipation of the 2012 Olympics"
April 2011,Loved it,"I stayed with a friend (who had stayed before) and wished I could have stayed longer. I have stayed in lots of large purpose built hotels but the Milestone beats these hands down. We had a room overlooking Kensington Gardens and the coffee in the room was much appreciated first thing in the morning, not your instant but real coffee with a cafetiere which I love. We had an evening meal which was lovely  and the breakfast was just as good. Eggs Benedict best I have had. The afternoon tea was delicious and the home made scones were fantastic, the only thing I would I would do next time is have a stronger tea. I would have loved to have seen more of the rooms but the hotel was busy so not possible. Would love to stay again in the future."
May 2011,Best Fantastic Hotel in Europe,"The best service we have ever received. The amazing staff at this hotel have a unique way of making you feel that you are the most important guest that has ever stayed. I found that  the service and attention to detail in both design and comfort that the Milestone provides, to be the best in London. The food is consistently excellent and they can usually handle any order you can think of.The room was fantastic! Room service was superb and they even have a pool and a fabulous masseuse. We will definitely be booking here for our next trip to London."
April 2011,Yet another lovely stay,"My friend and mysef stayed here for 2 nights and loved it. I had stayed here before with the hubby but it was my friends 1st time. We were given room 310 which had a wonderful view of the park. The staff as usual could not do enough for you. The only down side was the fact ,on Saturday morning after Breakfast in our room, we went out for a morning of sight seeing&shopping. We arrived back at 2.30pm to change for our pre booked afternoon tea and, housekeeping had not done our room!! We had a knock on the door by a member of staff to see if it had been done and she did apologise when she could see it hadn't. It was eventually done by 4.15pm which I think is rather late. Apart from that everything was perfect. Our meal on Friday night was delicious, as was breakfast on both…"
May 2011,3rd stay,"just finished third  stay in 6 months - perfect location for visiting family who just relocated to London- great transportation links to all parts of the city-when staying in a large city I like staying in a slightly more residential area rather than a ""downtown area""-the location of the Milestone reminds my husband and myself of the upper east and west sides of Manhattan- our homes for over 35 years- easy walking distance to the V&A, Royal Albert Hall, Kings Road, Harrods and Harvey Nichols- staff is excellent and decor is lovely- beds are very comfortable and amenities top-notch- looking forward to reurn visits"
April 2011,EXCELLENT!!,"The hotel is superb, the best we've stayed in, in London, by far. Attention to detail is fantastic and it makes such a pleasant change."
April 2011,Enjoyed my stay,"I enjoyed my stay here, the staff are nice and helpful. The location is ideal for all the key sights on London. I would come again."
April 2011,Fabulous!!!,"We went up to a show at the Royal Albert Hall, having taken a train up from Devon to Paddington ... believe me, there is nowhere better to stay! Wonderful walk across Hyde Park ... this beautiful hotel is next to Hyde Park and Near Kensington Palace. The staff there could not be more welcoming or helpful, They made me feel so so relaxed ... and I am a bit of a nervous traveller. The Milestone is gorgeous ... and also very much a home from home. We had room service before leaving for our show, as we'd had a long walk and were tired. The food was superb ....  and it was so easy to walk up to the Royal Albert Hall, and back again afterwards. Stress free. Slept well, and had breakfast in our rooms ... again wonderful!! Next day we walked to the Natural History museum....   and back…"
April 2011,Simply the best hotel in London. Impeccable service!,"The Milestone is a rare gem in London. Probably the last hotel with 1st class service. From the moment you check in to the moment you check out, the Milestone staff treat you like royalty. The restaurant food is delightful. You've got to try the eggs benedict for breakfast. The Hollandaise is the best I've had.  We stayed in the Apartments and had the sweetest room with two floors and a kitchen. What treat. Also, very convenient walk to Kensington Hgh Street Tube Station."
April 2011,Best hotel I have stayed at in Europe,"From the moment we arrived until the time we left, The Milestone Hotel provided us with a wonderful guest experience.  We had a room upgrade to a lovely suite, service that was gracious but not overbearing, excellent breakfasts and delicious evening hors d'oevres brought to our room.  The l0ocation was excellent and the common rooms werer delightfully British."
April 2011,A really enjoyable and relaxing stay.,"My wife and I spent 5 nights in the Prince Albert  Suite and enjoyed the views of Kensington Gardens, extremely comfortable accommodation and impeccable and friendly service. Do eat in the restaurant, do use room service and just enjoy a relaxing time, as we did. Fantastic base for sightseeing as it is near to everything but slightly more sedate than some central locations."
April 2011,Could easily move into the Milestone Hotel,"We stayed at the Milestone after a ghastly experience at another hotel. What a pleasure it was to meet the staff at the Milestone, enjoy the beautiful lobby, and relax in our gorgeously appointed room with a view of the park. Every detail is extremely elegant and well thought-through, and the bathrooms were tastefully done with top of the line fixtures. Also, the location (right across from Hyde Park) really couldn't be beat. My many thanks to Stephanie, Neil, and the entire staff at the Milestone for making our stay so memorable."
March 2011,Wonderful from start to finish!,"My husband and I just returned from a 5 night stay at the Milestone and it was a truly wonderful experience.  I agonized over where to stay in London and we had pretty much every option, but I am so glad we chose the Milestone.  Others have written about the top notch service and I totally agree.  Our experience started as soon as we arrived in London.  We opted to have the hotel provide transportation from Heathrow.  It was a bit more expensive than a taxi but so worth it to have the delightful Colin greet us after a long flight and even take us on a little tour before taking us to the hotel.  What a great way to start our vacation.  Everyone on staff was genuinely interested in making sure we were enjoying ourselves and had everything we needed (thanks Neil, Pedro and Marcus!)…"
May 2010,A top quality hotel,"I stayed at The Milestone Hotel in Mid March for the weekend as the base for my wedding in Hammersmith along with my family and a friend.  As soon as I arrived at the hotel the staff were charming, helpful and friendly. I was lucky enough to be staying in the beautiful Regency Suite and even though I had people turning up to do our hair and makeup,  the staff didn't stop being helpful and kind. My husband and I then stayed for our wedding night and again felt spoilt and had a lovely breakfast in the suite the next morning. A beautiful hotel, in a perfect location, great staff and a personal touch.  Thank you for helping to make our wedding weekend special."
March 2011,Very english hotel in great location,"My husband and I stayed at the Milestone hotel in the summer of 2010.  The hotel's location is fabulous and we had a great time.  High Street Kensington is just a few steps away in one direction, and Knightbridge is a short taxi or bus ride in the other direction.  Hyde Park is just across the street, which was great for morning jogs.  We both lived in London for years and know the city well, and this really is a great location to stay.  The hotel itself is very charming and quaint.  The decor is very old-fashioned english, very London.  Our room was very cute, but the bathroom felt a bit too old, and our sink was partly blocked.  Service was good, but I wouldn't say it was the best we ever experienced, and I'm surprised everyone else found it so amazing.  No complaints, but…"
March 2011,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Service","Beautiful hotel, great location and very friendly helpful staff.  We stayed in this hotel as part of a wedding party and the people couldn't do enough.  The hotel and rooms were very clean and service was great.  would definitely recommend it."
June 2011,London luxury at it's best,"We stayed at the Milestone for about a week and a half this March in an Apartment which for London was extraordinarily spacious. It consisted of two bedrooms, two full bathrooms, a living room and a kitchen. It also included all the facilities of the hotel.  	Having stayed at most of the Five star properties in London throughout my life. I have found the level of service and attention to detail in both design and comfort that the Milestone provides, to be the best in London.  	They consistently keep a record of guest preferences and in my opinion have the best guest services team. They are one of the few remaining hotels that I can find that not only provides round the clock complimentary butler service but also has in-house chauffeurs at affordable rates compared to comparable…"
July 2011,As good as the great reviews...,"Everything about the Milestone was in line with the many positive reviews we had read before we booked. We stayed for six nights with our four kids (aged between 8 and 14) and really enjoyed our time there. Ideally we would have had one of their apartments, but we booked quite late and they were Some key points:  The location is great. Being across the road from Kensington Palace Gardens was ideal....we were in the park every day, either for a long morning walk, to give the kids a run or to go for a bike ride on the great London bike rental scheme (note that one of the bike stations is almost opposite the hotel in the park). High St Kensington Tube station is 5 minutes walk away, as are plenty of good restaurants. We never waited for more than 3 minutes to get cabs out the front…"
July 2011,Absolutely wonderful,"We've stayed in many hotels in many cities, and our experience at The Milestone was among the very best. From the moment we arrived, my husband and I were treated with extreme warmth, as if we were being greeted by old friends. The service was impeccable, Neil the concierge couldn't have been more helpful and friendly. The room was wonderful, spotlessly clean. Make sure you stop in the bar and meet Markus. He's not only a wonderful bartender, but another warm and welcoming person at the Milestone.  By the time we left it was as if we were leaving friends."
June 2011,A fairy tale oasis of luxury,"The casual walker wouldn't even be aware that this wonderful small hotel existed  on Ken High St opposite  Kensington Gardens.But to the person who knows it is like a platform 9 3/4 leading you into a different dimension of luxury. I brought my partner here to propose  & for her birthday .The staff seemed to share in my determination  in making the weekend  special. After taking the booking questions were asked about the pillows we liked & dietery needs were taken note of. We were welcomed with such warmth,telling me we had been upgraded to a ""wonderful suite"".And wonderful it was.Set on 2 floors consisting of a beautiful lounge,leading down to the bedroom provided with every need imaginable.A little clip containing the name & address of the hotel with my name printed so I could…"
July 2011,"Fine, but not amazing","We stayed here the first week of Wimbledon.  Chose it because we'd stayed 1 night here 2 yrs ago (same time of year) and because of it's high ranking on TA. This time we were disappointed.  To be sure, the Milestone has many things going for it.  Great location, great linens, spotless bathrooms, very good service (we were particularly impressed w/ Fran & one of the bartenders), very comfortable bed, and because it was our anniversary, they did a beautiful spray of rose petals on our bed & bath, creating a very romantic ambiance.  But there are some downsides that I think people should know.    First, the showers.  They're short.  My husband is 6'2"" & I'm 5'8"".  I could barely stand under the shower head, and husband couldn't at all.  The room (both this 1 & the 1 we'd stayed in…"
June 2011,Favorite London Boutique Hotel,"Super-clean! Awesome staff! The recently re-done Tudor Suite is amazing! Loved Neil-the concierge-super helpful and a positive disposition, meeting Andrew-the GM and Steph-F&B Mgr at a happy hour: great guys! The housekeepers were the best-so discreet, never intruded + great turndown service. I love coming back to The Milestone (unlike No. 11 last year). Hoping to return soon and could easily stay longer than the 5 nights we did stay!"
June 2011,One of the most oustanding hotels we have ever been to,The milestone hotel was one of the best experience I have ever had as a traveler.. We went to London to go to wimbledon and this was over the top... We had 2 butlers and the concierge was amazing.  The room was beautiflul clean and ohhh so comfortable...  The food was yummy!! The service was impecable.  We Highly recommend this little piece of heaven.
June 2011,Great Stay at the Milestone,"Our first time in London and we couldn't have picked a better spot to stay.  Kensington is lovely and the Milestone is a great location in Kensington.  The staff prides itself on making your stay enjoyable -- and they succeeded.  We booked through the American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts Program -- well worth it.  We did not receive the room upgrade (as is possible when booking with AMEX FHR -- we actually had a small room), but the hotel made up for this by providing us a free valuable dinner at their high quality restaurant.  They did not need to do this, but offered this to us.  Dining in London is really expensive for Americans, so we certainly appreciated the offer. Breakfast as part of FHR  at the Milestone was available via room service for no extra charge --…"
May 2011,I wouldn't stay anywhere else in London,"I occasionally have the opportunity to stop in London for business and when doing so like to take some time to enjoy London.   The Milestone is the perfect place for both.      The location has good access for taxi's and drivers and also close to the London underground.  Located just off Kensington High Street there is lots of shopping close by, Portobello Market is walking distance , and Hyde Park is just accross the street for a relaxing walk or morning run.  Royal Albert Hall is only a few blocks down the street as well as a number of must see museums - Natural History, Kensington Palace  and the Victoria and Albert.  The hotel itself is fabulous.   Each room is different (I have visited five times now and look forward to the next)... all are nicely decorated, and truly make…"
June 2011,good service and nice hotel,The hotel it is located in a nice area of London-was my firt time in South Kensington In the beginning I had a room without view not so nice but after I please the reception to change the room.I had some difficulties but finally they gave me a very nice Junior suite-Paris -very charming and located to the last floor with a very nice vue to the park Breakfast was very nice-if and if the english breakfast was included in the price of the room the continental one was enough for me.I had also the afternoon tea in the hotel-also nice/ Despite to same dificulties in the beginning finally was a very nice stay. mm1118
February 2011,Excellent service!,The hotel is beautifully decorated and the staff are first rate. The food was delicious. It was a fabulous place to stay.
February 2011,Quite simply the best!,The best service we have ever received. The amazing staff at this hotel have a unique way of making you feel that you are the most important guest that has ever stayed. Our children loved every minute and did not want to leave. Exceeded our (very high!) expectations at every level. We have stayed in most of Londons top/famous hotels and not one of them comes close to the service and experience we had at The Milestone.
February 2011,Great charming hotel with great service,The room was fantastic! Room service was superb and they even have a pool and a fabulous masseuse named Fiona who gave one of the best massages I have ever had!!! I had a meeting and was late and the doorman got me a cab and the concierge was holding my Starbucks cappucino in his hand ready! I highly recommend the hotel.
February 2011,How Wonderful!,I've just returned from a really wonderful stay at The Milestone! Everything about the hotel is 100% five star.Service was beyond anything I've recieved anywhere else in the world. The people at The Milestone think of everything and then some. My room was beautiful and spotless. Turn down was really nice with different treats everynight. The staff from the front desk to the  housekeepers and everyone in between were lovely and very helpful. Don't miss this one when your in London. it's the place to stay!!!!!!!
February 2011,Made our children feel like royalty!,We had a fabulous stay at the Milestone. The staff were so helpful and the children had a wonderful time on their behind the scenes tour with Pedro. The children were made to feel so special with their own robes and slippers and a gift when they arrived. My daughter has several food allergies and the staff were all aware and very attentive. The chef was able to adapt his very exciting menu for her. The staff including Neil the manager and Stefan went out of their way to be friendly and welcoming. The rooms were an excellent size and we had an adjoing one for the children. We loved the resistance pool. We will definitely be returning.
February 2011,Can't wait to return to this amazing hotel,"My husband and I selected London as the destination where we wished to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary.  After much research we chose the Milestone Hotel and are so pleased that we did.  This is truly a lovely hotel with a wonderful staff.  Our entire experience greatly exceeded our expectations.  Our package included full English breakfast (very tasty and plentiful, charming and cheerful staff, cozy dining room) and private car transfer from Heathrow. Our delightful driver Colin took us on a little mini-tour before dropping us at the hotel, helping us to get our bearings.  Our lovely upgraded room was ready for us upon arrival.  On our second night at the Hotel we returned to our room after a show to find it decorated with candles and rose petals, with a bottle of…"
February 2011,Absolutely fabulous!,"My husband and I just returned after a weeklong stay at the Milestone. In a word, the experience was splendid! Let’s begin with the perfect setting – across the street from gorgeous Kensington gardens, a stones throw from the Kensington High Street stop on the Circle Line of the tube, and within walking distance to fabulous restaurants. A few words about the staff who immediately understands your wants and desires – Marcus could very well be the bartender of the year, Jim the concierge who never tires of meeting your every need, Teddy the hero who booked us a table at Il Portico where we were treated as part of the family, Neil the assistant manager who can make any guest feel at home at the Milestone. I could go on, but really you must just go and see for yourself."
February 2011,Fabulous hotel- felt totally spoilt!,"We picked this hotel after reviewing it on Tripadvisor- we were not let now! From the moment we walked in we received excellent service. We were shown around the hotel e.g. bar, dining areas, sauna etc. We were then taken to our room and shortly afterwards we received our commplimentary drinks ( which we had chosen previously on a form that they email to you). The room was lovely and we were not dissapointed- and we have stayed in 5 star htels around the world, inlcuding the Taj hotels in India.  They even went out of their way and supplied soya mlk for my husband , who is a vegan. The operations manager- Neil went out of his way to make our stay as comforatble as possible. Knowing that we were a vegetarian and vegan he even printed off details of a suitable restaurant for us. …"
January 2011,Amazing Afternoon tea - Didnt want to leave!,"The Milestone Hotel is just fabulas and you can see why its No3 currently in London. It only has 90 odd rooms so is small and personal. The moment i walk through the door the service blew me away. The lovely, lounge, bar and conservatory really made you feel at home and didnt want to leave. The Afternoon tea was cheaper than the major names of hotels but in my opinion was better. Sandwiches were nice but the scones were the best i ever tasted. Great pastries and cakes also. All items and tea were filled up as much as you wanted. Staff couldnt be faulted and cant wait to return."
January 2011,Consistently Amazing,This is our 5th or 6th stay at this wonderful gem of a hotel.  Each time we stay it is captivating.  The rooms are amazing - we've been given a different one each time - and the staff are all wonderful.  If you are visiting the Albert Hall or V&A/Science?Natural History Museum there really is nowhere better in terms of location and experience.  And of course - harrods is just up the road too!
January 2011,Outrageouse Brilliant........The best of the best,"Entering our own palace is the only way to explain the excellent hotel, The Milestone. Ebvery detail is outstanding from the brillian concierge neil who knew all the attractions and really made it his mission to find wonderful outings my 8 year old daughter would enjoy.  Besides watching the football match with her and relaying scores....The staff is exceptional the friendliness and the ability to rememebr all names and likes dislikes and prefereneces.  Teh rooms are all different so no one will have the exact room, remember thisis a historical building....an old monestery...the antiques are fantastic and it is like visiting a museum every room has a touch of hominess and charm and character.  High tea was the finest I have had....I have had many high teas around town but the…"
January 2011,Excellent!!!,"With ALL the very BEST comfort and service, in everything - in to the smallest details!!! We have travelled the world - and use to stay at the very best hotel - and this hotel was both very cozy and really nice with a lot of ""Home-feeling""!  Even before our visit - we received a ""personal wishing-list""from The Milestone -that asked us what we prefered and our choices of pillows and down-quilts, and ALL other wishes. And we did appreciate and really LOVED our cozy beatiful room - with really high comfort and a wonderful bed and a great view over the park! The service was excellent  and everything was really GREAT in to the smallest details! The staff were so KIND and wanted to full-fill every small wish we had! And even the kind breakfast-waitress knew our name, at once! We can…"
January 2011,Unique hotel with Great Location and Excellent Friendly service,"Hotel was everything we'd hoped for.All staff were very friendly and helpful.Rooms were all different and regardless of shape or size all offered the same quality. Perfect location with plenty of restaurants around the area.Excellent breakfast . We were a party of six 50 to 60 year olds, and found the only disappointment  was the dinner that evening .There was a selection from the A la Carte or Table D'ote menus.When asked if the Grills menu (which included steaks) was available we were told no.The food ,whilst good quality,was very Nouvelle Cuisine, lukewarm  and served on cold plates. One of our party chose the cod dish from the Table D'ote menu which was also very very salty (he probably should have sent it back but didn't). Whilst the restaurant itself was very pleasant and…"
November 2010,The Best service ever,"This was a birthday treat weekend for our daughter. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff who were helpful, kind and knowledgeable.  It was old fashioned service from a bygone era: discreet and helpful but not obsequious. The rooms were not huge but very, very comfortable and quiet: we looked out over Kensington gardens but didn't hear any traffic at all or any noise from other rooms. We dined in the restaurant (superb) and had a 'celebration' birthday tea - very Country House. This is not the cheapest option hotel in London but something that is perfect for a special event.  I would love to go back again."
November 2010,Words Cannot Describe...,"Absolutely beautiful hotel, a world away from my usual hectic schedule. Amazing view, amazing staff and quite literally is a small piece of heaven on earth. Made my week. Many thanks."
January 2011,Beautiful small Hotel with very friendly staff,Staying at the Milstone Hotel was a marvelous experience. The personnel was extremely friendly and the service was excellent. We felt at home immediately.
October 2010,Attentive staff made the experience outstanding,"This was our first stay at the Milestone and it has become our new favourite London hotel. The team were warm and ever-helpful with suggestions and nothing was too much trouble, from our use of the Bentley and driver for a very British experience, to the off-menu breakfast requests at Chenestons where we also enjoyed a superb dinner on the night before departure. The room was quiet, handsomely furnished, spotless, surprisingly spacious for a London room, and well provisioned with tasty treats and quality toiletries. The public spaces did not suffer from the sterility or pretentiousness of some other hotels so we actually sat in the lounge to read the newspapers after breakfast. The very personal experience of this small hotel and its attentive staff has won us over."
December 2010,Incredible hotel and accomodations,When my wife and I arrived in the afternoon we were greeted immediately and politely escorted to the front desk.  They greeted us by name and had a room ready...unfortunately it wasn't the type of room we anticipated and I asked they check again and after a few minutes they upgraded us to wonderful suite.  The staff was absolutely terrific and attentive.  The food at the restaurant was excellent and at tea time you couldn't ask for a better traditional experience.  The location in Kensington was marvelous.  This is a gem of a hotel.
January 2011,"Simply the best hotel experience you can imagine, home from home and more.","This is the fifth time we have stayed at the Milestone and with every visit it just gets better. The hotel enjoys a fantastic location, ask for a room overlooking the park. The staff are very attentive and greet all guests by name. Neil Anderson, guest services manager is an absolute professional. We had afternoon tea in the Park Lounge and next day had dinner in the Chenestons Restaurant, both are worthy of high praise. The rooms are all very well appointed and we've now stayed in a few of them including the truly amazing Prince Albert Suite, not cheap but very much worth it. We will certainly return to this amazing hotel. You will not be disappointed."
January 2011,"It was really nice, we spend a really good time, the personnal was very friendly","Well located, tipicaly english, with a warm welcome."
August 2011,Probably the Best Service in a London Hotel,"Due to the closure of Heathrow over the holiday period we found ourselves with a couple of extra days in London.  We booked The Milestone not really having any expectations really.   After several days in the Arctic temperatures of my Mother's house all I knew is that I wanted somewhere warm!  Well, even before we arrived the service was amazing.  The concierge went out of his way to help my husband to return our rental car and answer all of his questions.  From the minute we arrived we were treated with courtesy and respect by all members of staff.  Nothing was too much trouble.    We were upgraded to a studio room as our original room was not ready.  In response to the people who say that the rooms at this hotel are small - well, this is a very old building, in  a country not…"
September 2011,Beyond expectations - the only place we will stay in London!,"From the minute you arrive, the staff cannot do enough for you. Our room was spacious and well appointed. Excellent breakfast and afternoon tea. The location overlooking Kensington Gardens was beautiful."
August 2011,"Personal welcome, beautiful and comfortable - we'll be back!","From the friendly welcome at reception and personal attention from the butler who showed up our room, to the handwritten welcome letter from the hotel general manager (and biscuits!) waiting in the room. Every detail to make your stay comfortable has been thought through. the room had real wow factor - upholstered wallpaper, 1920's accessories combined with countryhouse chic furnishings.  The hotel room was fully kitted out like a small apartment - very convenient of packing light ofr a business or leisure visit to London.  We were there for one night only - was situated perfectly for walking to the Proms that night at the Royal Albert Hall. Thing I liked least was the small bathroom. Though luxuriously furnished, it was a tight squeeze to get round the door to the facilities. A…"
August 2011,Perfect in every way,"Our family experience here was perfect in every way.  We traveled with our young son and were welcomed, charmed and left wanting to come back again and again."
July 2011,A Very Happy Birthday for Me,"Pure hedonism lots of lovely little touches. The service was superb and friendly. Marcus the cocktail steward made the meanest dirty gin martinis. A lovely way to celebrate my ""milestone"" birthday."
August 2011,We enjoyed our test stay,It was really a good experience staying at your hotel. One of the best service I have ever experienced. Jojo
March 2011,"Wonderful hotel with great, personal service!","Our family recently stayed at the milestone and had two hotel rooms.  The rooms were beautifully decorated, as were all the common rooms in the hotel.  The staff were very helpful in meeting any of our needs.  The hotel is well located.  We will return!"
February 2011,Great location and service,"We stayed here for three nights over valentines weekend.  Was a fantastic stay, the location was great for getting out and about in London.  Close to knightsbridge and the museums.  The staff were fantastic from the moment we arrived, I think all hoteliers should stay here for a lesson on how it should be done!  We were upgraded to the Safari suite which we liked although I do think it may soon be in need of some refurbishment as was starting to look a little tired.  However it was large and spotlessly clean with a lovely view to Kensington Palace.  I loved the little evening treats of canapes and chocolates in the room.  Our romantic turndown was good although no music was put on.  Not quite sure why they ask for music preferences as it did not appear that music was provided so…"
March 2011,"Fantastic service, beautiful rooms, staff can't do enough for you!",I stayed in the Milestone for my sister's wedding. It was a beautiful hotel. A lovely breakfast and charming atmosphere in the bar at night time.The staff were so friendly and helpful. The service was 5 star. The best hotel I've stayed in!
August 2011,Why stay anywhere else if you wish to stay in the Kensington area when in London!,"Rightfully recognised as one of the world's top flight hotels The Milestone continues to delight and deliver. Rightfully it comes down to the staff. Nothing is too much trouble and it is delivered with a pleasant professionalism with no accompanying dramas. This is quality that The Milestone delivers consistently well. Marcus the barman in The Stables Bar produces Dry Martinis of the highest and dryest styles that easily equal those of The Savoy and The Stafford.  If the corporate budget accommodates, opt for one of the beautifully appointed, private entrance apartments that offer the facility for personally produced dining or the more easily accessed services of the hotel itself. If a landmark celebration is on your calendar then just contact Catherine Chandler who will see to…"
July 2011,One of the best hotels in the world,"I am a regular guest of the Milestone Hotel. I have been for about 7 years now. I recently stayed there again for work and pleasure, and the Milestone remains one of the best hotels in any category, anywhere in the world. The service is incredible. Yet you feel you are at home. There is nothing stuffy or formal about the hotel.   The concierge desk with Jim, Neil and Jose is fantastic. The location can't be beat with Kensington Park right outside the door. The little gym is lovely and their is a tiny spa if you want to indulge. The English breakfast is fantastic and the bar areas lovely.  The Milestone has the services of a five star hotel with the intimate feel of a boutique hotel or even huge townhouse home.   It is also quintessentially British which is lovely.  A British…"
July 2011,Resting on Laurels...,"Stayed here recently in an upgraded suite based largely on trip advisor recommendations. The location is quite good and the maid staff was quite attentive. However there were a lot of little things that added up to a less than stellar experience. We were given a room where you could barely walk around the bed and the shower you had to watch your head. Also, on our welcome tour from our butler essentially we were told if we needed anything to talk to the concierge. Didn,t see our supposed butler for the remainder. The setting of the hotel is quite stuffy including the bar which is admittedly quite quaint. Little things like spiders in the hallway and doormen who were rarely at the door were minor annoyances also.    All in all, if you like things ver formal and can get the place…"
July 2011,You simply can't find a more wonderful place to stay,"Whenever we return to our beloved London, where we we fortunate enough to live for four years, we stay at The Milestone. It's perfectly situated in our former Kensington neighborhood but the most important reason we continue to choose this gem of a hotel is that it's quite simply the most welcoming, comfortable and charming home-away-from-home one could imagine. It's elegant without being stuffy. Each and every member of the staff is outstanding. We're always sad to leave and always look forward to our next visit. You'll love it!"
March 2011,Really lovely - charming hotel with great service,"We travel a great deal and have not, until now, found a hotel we truly like in London.  This is a relatively small hotel, but with superb service and a lovely setting.  Although not inexpensive, the rate included breakfast and tea on the first day (which was far better than tea at the Plaza in New York).  The location is excellent, the common areas really lovely, and the room, although not large, was outstanding.  They have thought of every possible detail that you want in a hotel room - from an unobtrusive night light so that you can make your way to the bathroom in the dark, to beautiful linens, to a useful work area with good connectivity.  Bravo to the designer.  We will be back!"
March 2011,Great place to stay,Very Nice place to stay for business or leisure. Thé staf is wonderful and the service... Just perfect. Will make it again. K
March 2011,Superb service and quality standards,first class attention from first phone call  (to check parking arrangements) over a two night stay to leaving ; the quality of rooms and ambience was above expectations. I stayed for two nights with my wife ; three grown up daughters and a friend of theirs . the occasion was my eldest daughter's wedding on the saturday ; the atmosphere and professionalism of staff gave us the perfect start to our big day ; I would definitely return ; happy to pay a bit more to get this level of satisfaction.
March 2011,"Excellent hotel, staff and service","First time at this hotel normally stay at the Waldoff but must say this has now become my favourite hotel in London, Hotel perfect, food excellent and staff are great, well worth a visit for a quality break, Keep up the good work Milestone"
March 2011,Great London 5 star vanuit experience!,"From the helpfull staff, to the high standard of the room and all the thoughtfull details, f.i. the decoration of the room and penhaligon toiletries, the perfect smoked salmon and eggs benedict at Cheneston's,it is all an experience of à lifetime.Thank you all staff for à birthdaytrip to remember."
March 2011,Like Coming Home,"I spent 2 nights in February '11 and 3 nights in March '11 at the Milestone Hotel across from Kensington Park in London on the recommendation of my travel agent.  I was greeted by name so warmly upon arrival that I thought the staff mistakenly thought I'd been there before.  Each room was different and delightfully decorated.  The restaurant in the hotel, Cheneston's, was excellent.  Service was gracious and efficient in every aspect, from the bar and restaurant to Reception and Concierge service.  In short, it felt like coming home.  As I told my travel agent after the trip, ""I can never return to London without staying at the Milestone."""
February 2011,Fantastic Service,"I stay in London alot and have tried various hotels, never feeling the need to write a review on here as many were nice but with at best indifferent service. The Milestone is different, the staff were incredibly attentive and helpful and everything went smoothly from the minute I checked in to the minute I left. Just as a small example, I am a keen long distance runner and went for a run when I got up; when I got back an hour later the Doorman had a towel and bottle of water waiting for me. Its little touches of initiative like this that I think really make a difference."
November 2010,Simply the Best 5* Experience Ever,"We visited London w/end of 26th February to see Madam Butterfly at the Albert Hall so were looking for a hotel within easy walking distance that my arthritic knees could cope with! The Milestone is only a 10min easy walk away. It looked really wonderful from the pictures on their web site & what you see is really what you get in this case. We were going to travel down by train but due to the 'demise' of The Wreham & Shropshire' railway just a few weeks befoer our visit (after going into panic mode) we decided to travel by car. The hotel staff were superb & said just park outside & then one of their fully insured doormen would drive the car to secure car parking a short distance away,it cost £35-00 but was well worth it. That was such a relief for us, being 'country bumkins'. As…"
December 2010,Milestone FTW,"The service is world class, the staff are friendly and very accommodating. For one night I felt like I was famous, or filthy rich of which I'm neither. We were on our 10 year anniversary and were upgraded to the Princess suite which was truly out of this world. The room was the definition of refined elegance , The walls were lined with padded fabric and the 4 post bed was so comfortable I can honestly say I had the best night’s sleep of my life, the bathroom oozed luxury and the in room services which included internet on the TV. I can't sing this hotels praises enough, you haven't stayed at a world class hotel until you've spent a night here."
November 2010,Another perfect stay in a Red Carnation Hotel,"Stayed here because it's one of the red carnation group of hotels and we'd had such a great experience with 41, also in London. Again, the staff go out of their way to provide what you need, before you know you needed it. They provide a backstage tour of the hotel for kids, we were really cheeky and brought in two extras who weren't even checked in to the hotel, (""not a problem"" said Stephanie the excellent asst. guest services manager). In fact nothing was ever a problem for any of the staff, doesn't matter whether you're just arriving or leaving, the first rate service continues. Had a beautiful meal in the restaurant while the kids were entertained with the hotel tour and room service. The kids were impressed, they didn't know they were allowed to order drinks with room…"
December 2010,Absolutely stellar,"My spouse and I stayed at the Milestone for two nights.  We were there to celebrate our anniversary and they upgraded our room, gave us a cake and champagne, lit candles, and scattered our bed with rose petals.  The concierge staff was exceptionally helpful and diligent; they even talked East Coast Rail into getting us train tickets when our credit card would not work online.  Pedro, on the bell staff, was exceptionally helpful and the doorman was always smiling.  The location is great - near both Gloucester and High Street Kensington tube stations - and is right across from Kensington Park, of which we had a view from our room.  We arrived before our room was ready after an overnight flight, and they let us use the gym facilities where we could shower and refresh ourselves. …"
December 2010,Nice Hotel  but got ripped of when i needed a taxi to the airport,"Had a great stay but it was ruined by the concierge and doorman when I asked for a taxi ti the airport. The called me a car and I was charged £68  I taught it was going to be a good old london Taxi Like the one I got in from the airport, but now it wasnt it was a smart Merc but the driver was asian and very rude and tried to con a tip out of me outt another £20 when I said I paid he said that is what we should tip, I will just use a london black cab in future much cheaper and very friendly ,you know what you get"
November 2010,The ambiance,"The elegant,oldfashioned surroundings are very charming.  The staff was excellent. Each room is different so be specific what you want. We live around the corner from the hotel and have eaten there many times, always very good. This was our first hotel stay because we are moving from UK, we shall happily return to ""our "" location, at The Milestone."
November 2010,Absolutely perfect - as always!,"We have stayed several times at the Milestone and there can be no-where better. The staff deserve all the wonderful comments on TripAdvisor, they are very, very caring people. Little touches like the staff finding out our names and calling us Mr & Mrs Wilson. The room has every thing you could ever need, even a lip balm! I was delighted as it was very cold and trying to snow so this was wonderful to find.  A wonderful hotel, we cant wait for June as it is our next event at the Royal Albert Hall. My two favourite venues in the world."
November 2010,A Wonderful Experience !,"Having booked tickets for the Jools Holland concert at the Royal Albert Hall, and wishing to stay in London overnight, we stayed at the wonderful Milestone Hotel (our second visit in the past 18 months).  Once again the stay was simply wonderful - from the moment you arrive at the door to your departure you are made to feel so welcome, and nothing is too much trouble. Obviously service and accommodation on this level doesn't come cheap, but for a special occasion this is fabulous place to stay. We did not have dinner in the highly rated restaurant, so can't comment about the food.  However breakfast was faultless - although, since the restaurant is fairly small, you should expect a short delay during busy times.   Overall a fantastic experience and very convenient for anyone…"
November 2010,The Milestone is wonderfully professional and yet the friendliest of hotels.,"""No request too large, no detail too small"" accurately describes our experience at the Milestone. The staff were outstandingly attentive without being intrusive. The chauffeur who met us on a cold early morning at the airport and insisted on giving my wife his overcoat to wear, the reception staff who arranged for us to have very early access to our room, the restaurant staff who were a pleasure to meet each morning, all exemplified the kind of service that is all too rare. Our room was well appointed, quite spacious and extremely comfortable."
November 2010,"Wonderful, cozy 5 star hotel 5 minutes walk from the Royal Albert Hall","We picked this hotel as it was mentioned on the Royal Albert Hall's website as being very close by, and they offered a reduced rate of £255 for a room, including breakfast and VAT.  We were upgraded to the Regency Suite which was a great bonus - this room was fantastic - beautifully decorated and very spacious.  We filled out a guest form before arriving at the hotel, and as requested our free complimentary drink arrived after check-in (champagne), there were coffee facilities and a fruit platter ready in the room etc.  We had the pre-show dinner package, eating starter and main course before the show, and dessert & coffee afterwards which worked really well.  This was a very reasonable £26.50 each, although the drinks added up to more than the food (pretty standard in…"
December 2010,excellent,"Just loved this hotel. The staff made the stay so enjoyable. would stay again,"
July 2010,Perfect British Experience,"I stayed at the hotel for three nights, including Chritmas Eve, with my extended family, including three teenagers.  The hotel itself is lovely - an old mansion with lots of British atmosphere.  The lobby, tea room (with roaring fire) and bar are quintessentially British.  The rooms and baths are adequate in size and furnished beautifully.  But, the service was the real standout.  The staff pays attention to every detail and no request seems to be too much for them to accommodate."
December 2010,A lovely hotel in need of a good restaurant.,"A beautiful hotel in a lovely situation with very helpful staff. However the standard of food has deteriorated. The menu is a bizarre combination of dishes. I have eaten there regularly for the last ten years but as it is the nearest to us, keep returning in the hope that things have changed. Sadly this is not happening and this has now been abandoned.  Please complain when your food is of poor quality, cold or not what you expected."
December 2010,Christmas at the Milestone - Awesome!!!!!!!,"I have never posted on a travel website before but feel compelled to compliment The Milestone Hotel in London.  We have traveled extensively and typically stay in upscale hotels including our last trips to the Mandarin Oriental in Vegas, Atlantis in the Bahamas and Ritz Carltons all over the world.  I have to say we have received the best service during our stay at The Milestone of any hotel we have ever been to.  From the moment we walked in, every single person at the hotel knew the name of our family and greeted us as if we were their family.  We were checked into one of the apartments by the general manager himself.  I of course did not realize this until later after I had tipped him 5 pounds for showing us our rooms.  The apartment is a two story delight with a sitting room…"
December 2010,Most amazing experience at a hotel!,Stayed here for my birthday treat and felt special as soon as stepped through the door. The staff are amazingly attentive and will do anything to make sure you have a pleasant stay. Fiona in the spa gave my friends and i some wonderful treatments. If you think the rooms look beautiful i the pictures wait until you get inside. I cant wait to stay here again. I had a wonderful time!!!
December 2010,Beautiful 1st Wedding anniversary stay,Very little to complain about! Apart from the rare disappearance of a doorman on our arrival everything was exactly as expected and as hoped for.  Being an Leaders' Club  member  an upgrade was offered and we were given a wonderful deluxe studio. We were initially shown around the hotel before being shown our room and the whole experience was a worthwhile luxury. Of course staying there means spending a few £££s but for that quality I don't resent it! WIll happily return.
December 2010,I feel as tho I am coming home when I get to The Milestone.,"The older staff at The Milestone are awesome, and know how to provide incredible service.  A few of the ""interns"" can look a bit lost, but there always seems to be a nice, regular staff person to step in if needed. They found us same day tickets to The War Horse.  The meals were wonderful.  Breakfast service was great and our dinner was excellent and the sommelier (Lia) brought us a lovely red she had just selected for the list. I am ready to go back!"
December 2010,Best Hotel In London,"Seriously, is there a better hotel in London?  I would find that hard to believe.  The rooms are unbelievable - they are really beautiful, clean and well-maintained.  The staff is top-notch.  Right from the minute you check in, the front desk staff, the doormen, the amazing concierge staff.  These guys know service.  The restaurant is very nice and the room they use for afternoon tea is cozy.  My wife and I keep coming back to this hotel among other reasons because we love the afternoon tea so much.    Really I can't say enough about the hotel and the service.  If you're trying to decide where to stay in London, you can stop looking now and book the Milestone."
November 2010,Perfect as always,"This is our third time back to the milestone and it once again didn't disappoint! We picked the magical London package which is great, free movies, breakfast in bed 2 days, afternoon tea, a festive turn down (my favourite as it's all about the detail) and late check out on day of departure.  We came for our anniversary, as a special treat as it's got such a great location to all the shops. When we got there we were upgraded - this has never ever happened to me ever!! Then got a glass of champagne on arrival and with breakfast.  We ate in the restaurant, again perfect service and everyone was very attentive. The starters where gorgeous and different to the standard restaurants. The wine list was vast and ranged from very affordable to beyond extravagant. My favourite thing to do…"
November 2010,A hotel to revisit,"My husband and I stayed at The Milestone at the end of November and were extremely satisfied with everything. The staff were very pleasant and helpful (the concierge booked us some very good restaurants), everything was clean and welcoming. And of course the location needs mentioning. We Will definitely stay there again."
June 2011,A Delightful Hotel,My wife and I stayed for one night and were delighted with the hotel.  We felt welcome from the moment we checked in and we could not have asked for better service throughout our stay.  Our room was very well presented and toiletries etc were of the highest quality.  It is an excellent base for The Albert Hall and we will certainly return.
September 2010,Like a guest on a country estate,"Living at the Milestone hotel feels like being a guest of honour at a country estate. It is a small hotel and you d. not stay there if you want to be anonymous. They remember your name and are genuinely concerned to put their guests at the centre of attention. The personnel are polite, but present and fun to talk to.  The interior is sumptuous and beautiful, with heavy curtains and covered walls in beautifull, clear colours. A lot of the guests are American and many have been here before. This not difficult to notice as the staff remember them and are carefull to use their names. This is clearly a place where many people feel very comfortable. The rooms are well-equiped with PC, DVD and iPhone cradles (?) plus a selection of magazines chosen with you in mind. If you feel like a…"
December 2010,Best Hotel in London,"The Milestone may be the best hotel in London. Yes, it is pricey, but well worth the expense. From the moment you enter the lobby, where the welcoming staff make you feel right at home, to the formal tea you may take in the drawing room, the Milestone delivers. No detail is too small. Rooms are elegantly appointed, comfortable, and a cut above. This stay was our third, and we have never been disappointed."
May 2011,Not the best but very nice,"Milestone is a very nice hotel at a beautiful area. It may not be the best hotel I have ever stayed, but it is a nice place to stay for a few days for a short break in London"
May 2011,We loved it and plan a return visit as soon as we can!!,The Milestone Hotel is the finest hotel we have ever visited. My husband and I are ardent travelers and have been all over the world and will be happy to re-visit the staff at the Milestone Hotel whenever we will be in London. We felt very much at home and felt sad to say good-bye.
June 2011,What you would expect a British Hotel to be - AMAZING!,"We initially booked this hotel because our main priority was to stay within walking distance of the Royal Albert Hall.  My goodness,  we were not expecting it to be so amazing.  The front desk staff are probably the most polite and helpful I have ever come across, and I am fairly well travelled.  They are incredibly ""proper and british"" which added to the ambience of the hotel.  Nothing was too much trouble and you were treated like Royalty.  They remembered your name every time they saw you which I thought was a very nice touch.   We were given a guided tour of the hotel when we first arrived and then a complimentary glass of champagne.    The room was beautifully decorated and the bed was heavenly.  We felt as though we had discovered a goldmine with this hotel and will find…"
May 2011,MORE LIKE A COUNTRY HOUSE WEEKEND THAN A LONDON HOTEL,"Regarding our recent five day stay at the Milestone, we can only say that we feel that the Management have got the balance just right. Its a difficult trick to pull off but the staff were efficient whilst being genuinely helpful and friendly. More like a country house weekend than a city centre hotel. It is something we have become used to in the more relaxed setting of Bushman's Kloof (the Groups Wilderness Reserve in the mountains of the Cederberg in the Western Cape) - so a well done to the staff at the Milestone.     We wanted to stay at the Milestone as a special treat when we came to London to see family from South Africa as it was my 65th birthday. We have stayed at other hotels in the Red Carnation Group namely Bushman's Kloof and Twelve Apostles in Capetown but what we…"
May 2011,Absolutely wonderful experience,The Milestone met our expectations and exceeded them in every way. The service was outstanding and the staff could not have been more friendly. From the minute we arrived we were greeted warmly and personably. Thank you for a wonderful experience.
May 2011,A beautiful Hotel with impeccable service,"Having been to London several times before, I researched a number of potential Hotels for our stay. The Milestone was chosen based on the positive reviews on Tripadvisor. We stayed for 7 days during the middle of the month. We booked a Deluxe Studio room and upon check in, we were upgraded to a suite. This was an especially lovely gesture on the part of the Milestone. Many Hotels pretend to be 5 star plus and have all the usual superlatives about staff and service yet usually fall down on the most important item - Service. This is where the Milestone excels - the service is outstanding. It appears the staff actually enjoy their jobs and are interested in ensuring the guests have a wonderful stay. From the Concierge and his staff (every day they were helpful with directions and…"
May 2011,Royal treat,"My wife and I stayed four nights in the Milestone Hotel. From the moment we arrived we had the best treat we ever had in Europe. Everything was beyond our expectation despite all the great reviews we already read in trip advisor. Location is very central, near to underground, Hyde park, Nothing Hill, Museums, great restaurants and shopping district (in particular Harrods). Everyone in the Hotel is so friendly, professional and courteous that make you feel like staying in your own home with special service. We're upgraded to a studio room which was spectacular with all kinds  of in room amenities you could imagine. We had a bottle of champagne in the room with a beautiful card for my wife's birthday which really appreciated and portrayed the thoughtfulness of the management. I…"
November 2010,"Sincere, first class service in elegant Victorian-era surroundings","We just spent 4 days at The Milestone and can't conjure enough superlatives to do the property and its fantastic staff justice.  From the blooming flowers, cloud-like bed and large, marble bath (with loads of Penhaligon toiletries) in our roomy suite to the superb, gracious personal service from the front desk (Stephanie and Alexandra), concierge (2 equally helpful gentlemen), doorman (Danny and another gentleman whose name escapes me now), butler (Francis), housekeeping (thank you for the turn-down service, canapés, bottled water and chocolates), restaurant (thanks, Jack and 2 other colleagues for serving such memorable English breakfasts) and spa (thanks again, Fiona!) we were wowed and have found our home away from home in London.  The Milestone is located just across from…"
November 2010,Just perfect .. the only negative is we were only there for one night!,"We recently stayed at the Milestone Hotel and it was wonderful from start to finish.   We got a little tour of the hotel on arrival and then on being taken to our room a complimentary glass of champagne shortly followed to welcome us. The staff are just wonderful, so friendly, helpful and very attentive, you instantly feel at home. Always a cheery hello and goodbye as you're going to and from the hotel and just generally having a little chat.  The hotel is beautiful, not very big but that is exactly what we liked - often London hotels are so impersonal and bland but this was so intimate and beautifully decorated and furnished. The rooms are a good size for a London hotel, the bathroom especially I thought was really quite spacious, and the beds are very comfortable. All of the…"
September 2010,The Milestone Restaurant,"Fantastic a la carte menu, amazing ingredients showcased in a unique modern British way.  We were made to feel exceptionally special when Dale, the senior sous chef, came over to speak to us and explained the philosophy behind the dishes.  Would definitely recommend!"
November 2010,The most wonderful hotel in the world,"We stayed one night at The Milestone on the evening of our wedding.  Everything about our stay was magical from start to finish.  The staff are friendly, attentive and extremely professional.  The attention to detail is wonderful and stands this lovely hotel head and shoulders above the rest.  We were particularly delighted by their romantic enthusiasm as we arrived at our suite to find the room lit by candles and strewn with red rose petals."
October 2010,"An excellent hotel, a real treat.","From the moment we arrived we were treated to the very best experience that a luxury hotel could provide. The staff could not have been more helpful. We arrived early and were treated to complimentary Champagne whilst we waited, Upon being advised that our room was ready we were escorted to it via a tour of the hotel and a very amusing and informative description of it's history. The room itself was excellent and extremely well appointed, it was clean, literally spotless and smelt fresh. Everything in the room worked and there were plenty of toiletries in the bathroom, dressing gowns, slippers, everything you could want for. After having been in the room for 5 minutes or so we received a phone call from reception to check that our room was to our satisfaction. Nice touches: a…"
November 2010,Van and the Milestone a great combination,My partner arranged for us to see Van Morrison at the Royal Albert Hall. As the Milestone was close by and after seeing the other reviews we decided to stay there. We had a wonderful stay and the staff were very attentive and the room was lovely. Van was also great as always and next time he comes to the Royal Albert we are sure to stay at the Milestone.
October 2010,Top notch service from friendly staff,"Five of us stayed in an apartment for a week that had 2 bedrooms, 2.5 baths and a kitchen.  While still tight compared to American hotels, it was quite large compared to other alternatives we explored in London.  It was very well appointed, comfortable beds and clean.  Staff was exceptional with all very friendly and helpful.  The apartment was immaculate and was nicely appointed.  We would wholeheartedly recommend the Milestone and would definitely return there."
September 2010,Great Hotel in a great location,My wife and I came to London for 2 nights to see Van Morisson at The Royal Albert Hall and were recommended to stay at The Milestone as it was close by. We had a great stay. The room we had was beautiful and spacious and the little touches with the service they provide puts this hotel at the top of my list !!  We will be returning soon.
October 2010,The best hotel in London  ??,"We took our 13 year old Grand-daughter to London for 2 days. The Milestone was perfectly situated - we walked through the park to Buckingham Palace and went to the Royal Mews - then over to Kensington High St for Tea - back to the Hotel to change for the Last Night of the Proms,to which we walked,at the Royal Albert Hall.   Every time we went back to the Hotel the staff greeted us by name On arrival we had been upgraded from the standard room that we had booked to a fantastic suite ,with an adjoining sideroom for our Grand-daughter.Drinks and canapes arrived early evening and Ellie kept texting messages and pictures to her Parents and siblings. Wonderful rooms, incredible location and very special staff  -  we would reommend this hotel to you all."
April 2010,A small hotel with outstanding staff and amenities,"The Milestone has less than 60 rooms but what it lacks in size it makes up for in terms of accommodations and a superb staff.  Each room is decorated differently and all are wonderful.  The amenities for the room are outstanding.  The staff is most attentive and extraordinarily helpful.  At every level the service is as good as can be imagined.  Location in the Kensington area is excellent, with transportation and dining nearby.  All in all, the hotel is a jewel and worth a stay for anyone."
June 2010,Afternoon tea,"I arranged a surprise high tea for my Daughters Birthday. We had the conservatory for our party.This was ideal as we had a baby with us. The deco was excellent, the food and the service was superb.  Individual attention was given to our party and we felt so relax and felt very comfortable.  My daughter enjoyed her 30th Birthday surprise very much .  Thank you and your staff  for a very enjoyable afternoon"
July 2010,Treat Yourself To This Hotel,"We booked two nights at this hotel as it is an easy walk to the Albert Hall. This a small boutique hotel where you can feel safe and pampered. Our room, the African Suite had a safari theme which was delightful. The bed enormous, comfortable and the sheets to die for.  The room was a generous size and the service just right.    It was quite warm when we were there and so we appreciated the airconditioning. Wifi is available in the room.  Fresh fruit was waiting for us on arrival, small pieces of fruit and each one perfect. The breakfast is the best I have experienced in a hotel and I just wished I had enough money to move in permanently and have breakfast here every day of my life. I though the breakfasts in Manhattan were good but they still have something to learn from the…"
December 2009,I'm homesick for the Milestone,"I only stayed a week but made myself right at home.  The room was absolutely spotless however I would have enjoyed a better view. Upon request they changed the mattress to make it softer and gave me THE most comfortable pillow.  The bathroom literally sparkled.  While waiting for a taxi, the room maid waved hi to me and gave me the friendliest hello like she was my friend. Fiona at the spa is a doll and made me feel special and welcome. Location is amazing; Whole Foods and the Tube are a few steps away.  The hardworking Concierge got me all the theater tickets I wanted and knew the best restaurants in town; they were even able to get me reservations last minute.  One gentleman took the time to hand draw me a map, highlighted in yellow and everything to ensure I made it to my…"
July 2010,Fantastic Hotel,"I have stayed in the Milestone on three occasions,  twice on business and once with my young family.  The staff and service are unbeatable and made us feel very welcome.  Nothing is too much trouble and would recommend this hotel to anyone."
July 2010,great hotel!,"We stayed here for 2 nights following a Backroads cycling trip in Tuscany. My travel agent, recommended it. The hotel and hotel staff were awesome.  Comfy beds, large suite (we were upgraded, i have no idea why unless it was the AmEx platinum), clean, all sorts of useful items in the room like a normal blow dryer, scissors, tape etc...They brought snacks in the late afternoon, cold water, cookie or something sweet at night.  The concierge, who I had been emailing with for weeks before was great as well. Good location. We will stay here the next time we are in London."
July 2009,Deserves its #1 Trip Advisor Rating,All these good reviews are making this hotel even busier and I hope it doesn't cause them to raise their rates or make it impossible to get rooms there. Perhaps some lousy reviews are in order! Service is impeccable; food and beverage is quite strong -- the 3 course lunch in the hotel restaurant is well worth a try (although they did lightly burn my french toast at breakfast -- restoring my faith that you could count on this kind of thing in England). Via Amex Platinum I got a very strong upgrade from a junior suite to the Tudor Master Suite which was stunning and had decor that was beyond the norm for a city hotel. TVs in room had lots of channels with fuzzy pictures which is not right in this kind of place. Gym was adequate considering they didn't have a lot of space to work…
July 2010,Fantastic,"The Milestone Hotel was a great base during our time in London. The staff were fantastic: friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. Rooms were lovely, very comfortable. Highly recommended."
June 2010,Home away from Home?,"After reviewing a fair amount of 5 star hotels on TripAdvisor I made the decision to stay at the Milestone in a superior king room for the last night of a European trip, and one night after my engagement in Paris  The hotel is perfectly positioned in personally my favorite part of London   The experience we had during our stay has pushed me to register my first review on Tripadvisor, and what a fantastic experience it was  The hotel, despite being grand in stature and decoration is extremely friendly, staff are courteous, helpful and go above and beyond to ensure you are happy  Two examples of this would be walking into the observatory bar where a meeting was being held between senior management of the hotel, who introduced themselves, asked about our stay and relocated to a…"
July 2010,Another exceptional stay at the Milestone,"We stayed at the Milestone again this year, and found it just as wonderful as our first visit last year. All the staff,  the General Manager, Concierges, Front Office, Restaurant, Bar, Housekeeping, have this remarkable ability to treat you like you're a welcomed member of the family, while maintaining a professional courtesy that is just as soothing and easy as it gets in a home that's not your own. The over-used phrase ""A Home Away From Home"" applies to the Milestone on every level of the experience of staying there. Make sure to check out the library -- maybe the nicest room in London in which to sit and feel peaceful! Our best meals while in London were at the Milestone. Tea was wonderful, easily surpassing the more well-known tea destinations, and dinner on our last night,…"
July 2010,Old world charm and fabulous location,"This hotel is part of the red carnation group and specialises in personalising your stay, down to your own choice of mineral water, bedding and fruit.  There is an army of staff waiting to take care of your every need/desire.  The one problem with our one night stay was that the room was not ready on time.  To me the little luxuries mean nothing if you can't get the basics right.  It is simply not good enough to arrive at the specified check-in time, only to have to wait for an hour in the foyer.  To make matters worse we were then late for afternoon tea, only to be told that they had a two-sitting arrangement and we had to finish by a specified time.  We actually finished in plenty of time and without rushing, but the principle rankled.  Once in our room, however, we enjoyed…"
August 2010,"The best London Hotel, outstanding service","I've been in this hotel for one night, after reading the extremely positive comments. This is really a pearl in London and the staff is outstanding! I have been to several luxury hotel in London but the Milestone beats them all. This hotel in now on the top of my accomodation list when in London!"
August 2010,WHEN CAN WE COME BACK !!!,"We just returned from the most amazing hotel we have ever stayed in and we have been at many...We decided to spend a week post cruise ( Aug 23-28 2010) in London at the Milestone Hotel and we couldn't have chosen a more perfect ending to a trip of a life time celebrating our 35th wedding anniversary..From the moment we arrived we were overwhelmed by the beautiful exterior and interior of this hotel..The entire hotel staff was so warm and welcoming and definitely set the tone for our entire five night stay..Nothing escaped their eye for detail..From the tour of the hotel and introduction to all the staff to the cocktails and sweets as we entered our room..We loved the location,size and view from of our deluxe king room #504..After returning that first evening from a bit of…"
September 2010,Looking forward to my next trip!,We would like to thank all the staff at the Milestone Hotel.  They made our trip one to remember.  The food was some of the best that i've had and it was always served to us with a smile. Our room was cleaned to perfection with the outstanding views over Kensington Park.  I would like to say a special thank you to the front of house team who were so helpful and gave me so much information for this beautiful city.  I am looking forward to my next visit already!
August 2010,"Overpriced and Overrated, With Poor Maintenance","First, it is obvious that many travelers automatically give this a 5 star rating...some sort of group-think behavior must be at work here. This is not a service to one's fellow travelers; rather, it provides no real information.  I don't appreciate these kinds of rah rah rah reviews that just rave about a hotel, yet provide no balanced information.  Perhaps the people are not experienced travelers; some might call them gullible. So, here I will present an accurate review without the fluff!  This is a small, boutique hotel located in the Kensington South area of London.  It is well located with easy access to London sites.  However, it provides very small rooms for an inflated price. For example, our ""Deluxe Studio"" was so cramped we kept tripping over our suitcases, received…"
April 2010,Very good small luxury hotel,"Stayed one night over the August Bank Holiday.  Parking was straightforward and we managed to park right outside the hotel on a single yellow.  Receptionist was professional and friendly, although she tried to ""up"" sell me a better room which I never like and felt this tactic was a little cheap - if I want a better room I'll book one!  We were escorted around the hotel by a really nice gent.  The hotels public rooms, although small are lovely.  The bar and conservatory were particularly nice.  We had a welcome glass of Champagne, which was complimentary; and the nibbles were great.  We purposefully booked the basic double as we were not planning on staying in the room for the weekend.  The room was tasteful and the quality perfect.  Lovely fabric wallpaper and all of the…"
June 2010,A True Delight,"Stayed in this Hotel back in April was was truly amazed. Had lived for many years in London and never heard of this particular gem.  Beautiful little hotel, with  outrageously good service. Would love to say I will stay again, however I own an apartment close by so will just need to ensure my friends stay there so I can return."
July 2010,The hotel you always hoped you would find in London,"A wonderful experience from start to finish.  We loved the look of the hotel when we drove up ---it's location is ideal -- and we were greeted warmly and professionally by the front door staff and the desk.  Our room was beautifully furnished, the dining room excellent, and the facilities and features of the hotel are all superb.   It's NOT modern --- it has wonderful, authentic, old world charm, but it is beautifully maintained.   Most of all the staff was uniformly polite, thoughtful, and they simply couldn't do enough to help you have a good stay.   I don't think we'll ever stay anywhere else."
July 2010,A quaint family hotel in London. Loved it.,"If your looking for a great boutique hotel that can offer some home-like amenities, this would be your place. My younger daughter travelled with me and she was instantly greeted with the friendliest staff.  We had an apartment that provided a full kitchen and laundry.  The breakfast was seriously the best I have had in London - great pancakes and waffles.  The neighborhood offers great shopping and easy access to transportation.  I can't wait to stay there again."
July 2010,"Nice, but a bit cramped","We had two rooms at the Milestone for four nights.  The staff was helpful, graciously overlooking the fact that my daughter threw up in the lobby within an hour of our arrival, the location across from the park, great, and the sound proofing of the rooms, excellent--I didn't hear any street traffic at night.  Accustomed as I am to small European hotel rooms, I felt particularly cramped at the Milestone, however.  There wasn't  space for two carry-on suit cases in the room and room service had to be eaten on a tray on the bed.  I prefer a bit more space.  We ate breakfast, which was very good, in our rooms because the dining room was quite small and we usually had to wait for a table."
July 2010,This hotel provided the best service we have experienced in many years.,"Not only was the service excellent, but the employees were so outgoing and friendly. One could tell the employees enjoyed their jobs and it showed in their contact with the customers (hotel guests). This certainly is a reflection of good management, selection of good emploees and proper training."
April 2010,First class hotel and excellent service,"I travel all over he world on business and at times have had to put up with some rather indifferent hotel rooms and service. However, the Milestone hotel in Kennsington, London was really quite special and for me, set a new standard in 5* treatment. The management team really seemed to appreciate the guest. The staff, room/food quality and overall location of the hotel was really excellent. Although it is a boutique hotel, the standards are extremely high and I will now always say there when travelling to London. Highly recommended."
October 2010,Excellent afternoon tea,I was given a nice surpise by my family for afternoon tea for my birthday. I was greeted at the front door and taken through to the conservatory where my family were waiting. The setting was spectacular and the service was impeccable. I was treated to a beautiful birthday cake made by the hotel which really topped my whole day off. I could not fault it!
August 2010,Wonderful hotel !!!,"Nice staff, great location, good restaurant. We hope to come back ....."
November 2009,We thought we heard john lennon!,"We heard ""love is a stranger"" by Brahman Kelleher, and i swear it reminded my of a johnny cash meets john lennon!  This hotel rocks! I like hotels who cater to a discerning ear! Service was top notch, a spot on value!  Highly recommended!"
December 2009,"Elegant, intimate, beautiful....","This is a beautiful luxury small hotel right in front of Kensington Palace with views over the park and 3 minutes from Kensington High Street. Excellent, discreet, personalised service and smiles from all the members of staff. Superb restaurant with knowledgeable wine waiter. The rooms are beautifully maintained and spotlessly clean. We have stayed here  twice and loved it. Definitely to be recommended."
September 2010,"Great staff, small rooms","The only thing that makes this hotel stand out from all the other small hotels in London is the great staff, other than that, it is simply another small hotel, with small rooms, charging huge prices.  It is overpriced for what it delivers, but many London hotels are in the same category.  Another positive is its good location, but then that shouldn't be a reason to overcharge for the level or quality of its rooms.  I would only stay again for an overnighter."
September 2010,Simply Sublime,"I just returned from a weeks stay at the Milestone.  I cannot say enough about the level of warmth and hospitality displayed by the staff there.  We frequently stay at top tier hotels around the world and have not seen the consistency of good service that we received.  In particular, Neil our primary Concierge was brilliant. Before our arrival he emailed me with a great list of recommended restaurants.  He got us outstanding tickets to see a play and also made all of our daily activities easier with help from his local knowledge. A great sense of urgency and dry sense humor made him seem like part of the family. We were upgraded (thank you Platinum Amex) to the Tudor suite.  The room was large and opulent. Every day we received some sort of goodies like fresh fruit, champagne,…"
September 2010,"Incredible and beautiful hotel, impeccable services and amenities, great location and superior comfort","The Milestone Hotel is simply incredible.  From the day we contacted Doris to book an apartment almost a year prior to our sta, thru correspondence back and forth with her to select our apartment, thru the impeccable services that Jim, Neil, Patrick and others provided during our stay, this is one of the finest hotels we have every stayed in, period.  The concierge and front desk team were right on with all of their recommendations about tourist sites, restaurants, travel and logistics and other things throughout our stay.  Although the individual rooms are also beautiful and comfortable, if you are traveling with two couples or a small family, we would strongly recommend that you consider renting one of the 2 bedroom apartments which are part of the hotel, which usually include…"
September 2010,Simply the Best Hotel in London,"If you want service -- I mean REAL service -- stay at this hotel.  We've stayed there twice in three months.  It is simply the best hotel in London and on the world's top ten of hotels in the world.  We've stayed at many hotels around the world:  they could all learn something from The Milestone -- and these hotels I'm talking about include Four Seasons, Ritz Carltons, Raffles and other high end chains.  Not much more I can say.  Try it."
September 2010,Outstanding Service,"We stayed here for two nights to do some shopping in Knightsbridge. The service is second to none. From the concierges who take your luggage to your room and park the car to the restaurant / bar staff who will provide anything you could want, this is a place of outstanding, friendly service. The rooms are exactly as they should be, clean, comfortable,quiet etc. This was our third stay here and we would not consider staying at any other London hotel. The situation is perfect for the Albert Hall, Kensington Palace is opposite, the V&A is a short walk away as is the Science Museum, Harrods , Harvey Nicholls etc. Wonderful, relaxing place."
January 2010,Timeless elegance and warmth of a country home in the city,"The Milestone Hotel is an experience if one is seeking that home welcoming atmosphere as well as the best service and accommodations. The rooms are very unique,elegantly arranged and spotless. If you appreciate art as I do, you can tour the floors and admire the timeless art work and antique arrangements. The afternoon tea service is a must experience that will transport you back to the Era of Elegance and the Golden Age of beauty and refinement. I enjoyed every aspect of The Milestone Hotel and recommend that you experience the atmosphere for yourself."
January 2010,An absolute gem,"Have stayed here twice in the last 4 months. I was spoiled here for my birthday. We checked in early and our room was ready. The staff are amazing, addressing you by name, & make an effort to remember you so when you come back to the hotel will often ask how your day was etc. The rooms are luxurious for London. They may be on the small side but are so individual and thoughtfully decorated and equipped. We had fruit in our room on arrival, a wonderful turndown service,  towelling robes, slippers etc. The staff are so helpful and nice, they really want you to enjoy your stay. The breakfast is excellent with a great choice. Concierge service is one of the best around. They provided free in house movies for our children and free wii games etc. It is by far my favourite London hotel…"
December 2009,Perfection,"This hotel is an absolute hidden London gem ! Our stay was perfect in every way. From our initial greeting by the Guest Services Manager Neil upon arrival to the great meal in the restaurant, which we had. It was my husbands birthday and we were totally spoiled. Our room was magnificent (Room 402, The Harlequin Suite) and the attention to guests needs was a different level to anything we have experinced in many other top name hotels. We will be going back without hesitation. Thank you Neil and all the wonderful staff at The Milestone Hotel."
December 2009,Simply the Best!,"We wanted to take our three children to London to have a New Year's visit that they would never forget.  We have been to many beautiful hotels all over the world, and I can assure you that this is one of the best that we have ever stayed in.  The attention to detail is second to none and no request is too small.  The staff are charming, helpful and all knew us by name within hours of our arrival.  We took a Grand Master suite and the children shared the adjoining studio.  The decor is fabulous and does not suffer from that rather tired look that pervades many of London's hotels.  The little touches that were so impressive were the visiting cards that we could use to have purchases delivered to our hotel, the bouquet of flowers, the candles in the bathroom, the turn-down service,…"
January 2010,"Brilliant,proffesional,efficient service old world attention to detail.","Hotel staff extremely helpful with various requests and services. Effortless VIP transits from and to St. Pancras. Very tidy, excellent atmosphere. Exemplary concierge service - wish all hotels could emulate this. Excellent location."
December 2009,"Lovely hotel, very welcoming staff!","My partner and I stayed at the Milestone for New Year's Eve (thought we would treat ourselves).  Would just lke to say this is a great hotel to stay at if you want to experience how the other half live.  The rooms are luxurious and very comfortable with everything you would need and more!  The staff I think are one of the many things that make this hotel the best to stay at in Knightsbridge from welcoming you at the beginning of your staf until the minute you leave, for example when you arrive at the hotel you are given a tour of all the amenities in the hotel that are available to you by a very charming guide who is there to answer any questions you may have.  As we do not normally stay in hotels in the same class as this we were apprehensive about how we would fit in with…"
September 2009,We found our beautiful London home away from home....,"My family and I traveled to London for the Christmas holidays and to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday. After hours of research, I chose the Milestone Hotel for 6 nights. Everything about the hotel was warm and inviting.  The staff was friendly and helpful without being overbearing.  We had an apartment unit which was everything we could have hoped for and more.  The rooms were tastefully decorated and the beds were comfortable with glorious linens.  The bathrooms were beautiful as well.  We had a small issue with the heat in the sitting room and the maintenance person was there in minutes and even came back the next day just to check it again. The breakfasts were good with a wide selection.  One evening we dined in their gourmet restaurant,  and had a fabulous meal; also, to…"
December 2009,A Gem In The Heart Of London.,"I picked The Milestone Hotel in London, from a colleagues recommendation -- and also the fact that it was listed as the #1 hotel in London on tripadvisor. From the moment I arrived at the hotel, and was greeted by the friendliest doorman, I knew I had made the right decision. The staff were incredible. The friendliest I have ever encountered. They were always available to talk to, without being intrusive. I was escorted to my room by a member of staff, who very kindly gave me tips and facts about the hotel. The room was spacious, with a very comfortable king bed. A lovely bowl of fruit, and lots of modern touches such as a ipod dock, wireless internet, rain shower, deep bath, exquisite toiletries. No wonder this hotel was rated as Conde Naste #1 hotel in the UK. It's very…"
September 2009,Wonderful stay at the Milestone,"Treated my husband for his birthday for two nights in the run up to Christmas.  We have stayed at several Red Carnation hotels before, our favourite being the Chesterfield.   We really liked The Milestone.  The surroundings and decor are very similar in style to that of the Chesterfield and other hotels within the group.  We find the level of service at all their hotels to be outstanding and the Milestone was no exception. On arrival we were greeted by a gentleman, who gave us a tour of the public rooms before taking us up to our room, which was beautifully appointed, with a lovely view over Kensington Palace Gardens.  He then arranged for a couple of glasses of champagne, to be sent up, very nice!! We dined at the hotel on the first evening, which was lovely as all the rooms…"
December 2009,A special place,"We stayed two nights in this charming, old style hotel close by Kensington Gardens.  Staff and rooms are outstanding.  We only had breakfast at the hotel, it was also great.  Easy access to the Metro to get into London central close to several museums."
May 2010,Can't wait to return,"My-self and hubby had 2 nights at the Milestone and it was lovely. We were celebrating our 25th anniversary.  In our room which was 109 we had champagne and cards off the management.  The staff really can't do enough for you, nothing is to much trouble. We ate in the restaurant the 1st night and I can honestly say it was one of the best meals we had eaten. We opted for breakfast in our room on the 1st morning ( perfect ) Went down for breakfast the 2nd morning ( perfect ).  Our room was very comfortable and roomy.  The hotel is in a fantastic position for getting around London.  Would stay again."
June 2010,"the Milestone is simply ""THE HOTEL!""","Along the last thirty years I've travelled a lot around the world,mainly on business travels as a multinational executive,.  Now after my retirement , me and my wyfe travel abroad one to two times a year. Therefore I!ve  had the opportunity of knowing excelent hotels. The Milestone was an exciting surprise. I've never seen a hotel like it.  It's like being home. Everithing was perfect during the seven nights we stayed there. Summarizing: On our next London visit we certainly will book the Milestone again. Rubens Becker, Brazil"
June 2010,A wonderful authentic hotel with small bedrooms,"First the positives and I mainly have positive comments.  The location is great in Kensington with nice restaurants and pubs and Kensington Gardens just across the street.  The hotel is old and authentic with some history.  The public rooms are not grand but beautiful and cozy.  By and large the staff are friendly and helpful but some were less so.  Patrick, the concierge was absolutely perfect and very helpful.  The bedrooms are beautifully appointed by very small.  If quaint and small don't bother you, then you'll love this hotel.  Same with the workout facilities.  They did the most with the limited space they had but it's small.  Yes I recommend this hotel and would return but I would have to way its charm and authenticity against the somewhat cramped feel."
June 2010,A very wonderful place to stay.,"We considered staying in Kennsington when visiting London and compared a few of the hotels in the area.  We decided on the Milestone because it just seemed like the most comfortable place of all that we had viewed. It is only a few blocks from the inner city train and the best fish and chips in London is only a ten minute walk from the hotel.  The best Indian restaurant in the world is about twenty feet away. .The staff couldn't have been more helpful and courteous at all times. Yussuf at the reception desk was most gracious throughout our stay and always accommodated our every inquiry or request.  The concierges, Patrick and Jim, were on all occasions present when needed and provided valuable reservations and tourist information on the spot.  We never laughed so much at…"
February 2008,If you want a special place in London; The Milestone is it,"My family and I were treated like ROYALTY by the staff! A special ""thank you"" to Patrick for taking care of us!  Especially, when we got lost on the tube, he offered to hop in a cab to come find us. Our suite, The Prince Albert was stunning and very spacious. The bed, pillows and comforter were SO comfy! Housekeeping was outstanding throughout our stay. The turndown service is so special & sweet. I especially enjoyed the floating candle in the bath in the evening. Fiona and the spa are world class! I cannot say enough good things about staying at The Milestone!  Only one disappointment....In room dining Needs to have healthier options or be more accomodating to special requests. I was told I could not order anything besides what was on the menu. It was a little disappointing…"
June 2010,Too expensive for what it is!,"At first look  we loved the place, it was like a country home. Lounge, bar, staff etc. BUT the noise in the room made it impossible to sleep ..we changed rooms and it was the same. it is a very old building and the AC/ Heater, Lift and floor, make noise..Jet legged and exhausted I have suffered alot. The staff are very kind and will do anything for you but they cannot make the irritating noise go away..Breakfast was a big disappointment ..1 young waiter was so nasty to me with no reason..service slow and no choice at all...Extremely expensive for what it is! Need total refurbishment and isolation."
April 2010,A truly mixed review,"This is a lovely property with an attentive and polite staff. It is clear that the property is making every effort to provide a top-notch experience. Having stayed at leading hotels around the world, I have to give the Milestone a mixed review and say that having read other reviews on TripAdvisor I was a bit disappointed.  What excelled here was the housekeeping service and the friendly and attentive staff. Rooms were attended to with perfection and after the maid left, a supervisor showed up at the room double-checking everything from the waste bin to the proper functioning of each light switch and bulb. Everyone at the hotel-- from the concierge to the bartender -- had hospitality as a priority. As a solo traveller I felt extremely comfortable. And the location was just…"
April 2010,Romantic stay made extra special,"My boyfriend and I were going to London to watch the semi finals of the FA cup so we decided to make the most of it and splash out on a nice hotel.  After reading the reviews, I took a deep breath after committing to such an expensive place to stay and hoped for the best!  I made the reservation over the phone, explained to the lady that we haven't really been away in ages and if we could have a nice room. I opted for the romantic turn down with champagne and that was great!  Our stay was so good, we booked for an extra night!  The room was 502 and although it did feel a little 'small' considering the amount of furniture and the size of the bed. The four poster bed and decor were very romantic - I wish I had a bed like that at home! Bathroom was huge and very nicely done. …"
May 2010,Like having a home away from home in London only with fantastic staff included.,"We were exceptionally pleased with our more than 2 week stay at the Milestone. After a short period of time it felt like we had a home away from home. The staff there is fantastic. It is hard to imagine a group of people taking better care of us than the staff at the Milestone. And they are so friendly that we almost felt like family after a few days. To us one of the best things about the Milestone is Lauren, Neil, Teddy, Jose, Jim, Patrick and Terry. And Neil is probably the best hotel concierge we have had the pleasure of working with. As long as they have a room, we will never stay at another hotel in London. We plan on returning every year."
April 2010,Fab!!,"We stayed for four nights this May for my husbands birthday, we were upgraded to a suite with an adjoining room for our little boy.  As all the other reviews state it is a very good hotel, personalised to you.  We were made very welcome, especially my four year old, who is a little boistorous.  I would go back just for the turn down service, with the canapes and bags of sweets, and oh the fresh daily flowers.  It's close to the tubes and Kensington Park.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.  Didn't find the champagne on tap though!  Maybe next time.  One tip I'd go early for breakfast during the weekend, as there was a bit of a last minute rush from the late sleepers."
November 2009,"impeccable service, charming rooms, great location","After the impersonal service of the Berkeley, it was a pleasure to check into the Milestone.  The service was exemplary. Our junior suite was charmingly furnished and the room was a comfortable size.  There was no detail that was overlooked, including a lit candle by the tub, full sized toiletries, great towels. Every member of the staff knew us by name. The location was superb, park front, close to the V and A and great shopping on Kensington High Street without the madness of Oxford Street. We loved it and will make it the hotel of our choice , everytime we stay in London"
September 2009,Food Service Needs to be as Good as the Rooms,"We stayed here for a weekend in November, 2009. The hotel is in a great location and has lovely public areas. The reception staff were great and the doorman was really friendly in showing us to our room. The room itself was lovely, very well furnished with a big bathroom - generally a very high standard.  The only place that the hotel lets itself down is when it comes to food service in the restaurant. We did not eat dinner at the hotel so have no experience of dinner but the breakfast service was a bit chaotic. On the first day we were asked quite a few times what our room number was and then we were served an omelette that we didn't order. The food that did come was ok but nothing special - I'd expect something a bit out of the ordinary at the room rate that the hotel charges.…"
November 2009,Milestone apartements - perfect base in London,"We stayed at the Milestone apartments in September 2009 with our 2 year old son and our nanny. The apartment was a perfect choice, as it offers the same beautiful traditional decor like the rest of the hotel, but more space and a kitchen.  The public areas of this hotel are beautifully decorated. They are on a rather small side but it doesn't matter as this gives the hotel an intimate feeling. Our apartment was beautiful,  full of light with all the amenities, serviced twice a day. Marble bathrooms were specious and had huge bottles of Penhaligon's toiletries. Bedrooms were plush with matching draperies, carpets, bed canopies and wallpaper all in traditional English style.  The location of the hotel is great, right across from Kensington Gardens and very close to some major…"
October 2009,All of the superlatives are true!,"I booked this hotel through American Express, having cross referenced all of the London hotels in their book with Trip Advisor.  As the Milestone  had the highest trip advisor reviews, I chose it for my family of four and  am so happy I did. If you are looking to have an authentic  holiday in London, I think you will find the following to be true about the Milestone Hotel:  Location:  excellent,; our 5th floor rooms had a wonderful view of Hyde park and Kensington Palace.  There is a short walk to the  Park, the Palace and the Orangery which serves lovely tea and cakes.  It is also only a short walk to the South Kensington tube and  many small restaurants.   There  is roughly a fifteen minute stroll to Harrods and Harvey Nichols, and an approximately sixteen  pound taxi ride,…"
October 2009,wonderful stay!!!,"it was totally wonderful , the staff was very helpful and the location of the hotel was very good. I strongly recommend this hotel for everybody who wants a great holiday!!!"
November 2009,A wonderful experience,This hotel is just wonderful.  From the time you arrive through check out you are made to feel so special.  The rooms are all different and unique.  We were in the Harlequin Suite which had a fun black and white theme.  The staff were so  friendly and professional and could not do enough for you.  We were there 4 nights and the staff would greet you by name.  The breakfast room was charming and the service and food great.  We usually had a waitress Lou whou would remember your name and what you liked to eat. The neighborhood and location are great.  Easy walk to the tube and many great neighborhood restaurants. I can't say enough good things about The Milestone.
October 2009,A beautiful boutique hotel,"My husband and I recently stayed for 2 nights at the Milestone Hotel in kensington, London to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It is a beautiful boutique hotel and we will certainly consider returning and would recommend to friends. The front of house service was excellent as was our dining experience. Our room was a little compact but it was decorated beautifully as was the rest of the hotel. Our only little niggle was the breakfast service on the 2nd day which was very disappointing. With only 2 tables in the restaurant I was very surprised to have waited 40 mins for a cooked breakfast and when it arrived to find a rock hard poached egg. We were also overcharged for 2 glasses of champagne at dinner which were meant to be complimentary for the month of November.  As soon as…"
October 2009,Royal excellence,"We felt like royalty, upgraded to a juniorsuite, champagne and midnight feast for our anniversary. Hard working staff . How would we ever exceed this anniversary."
August 2009,My new favorite in London,"Hard to beat.  Wonderful location in Kensington near Notting Hill.  Outstanding service, impeccable charming rooms, great breakfast room."
June 2009,"Charm, Atmosphere, Impeccable service, you wont be disappointed.","My wife and i spent our 20th Anniversary in London and stayed at the Milestone. we chose it because of the fine reviews on trip advisor. I must say that however glowing the reviews were they could never do the hotel, staff and atmosphere justice. We only had one night to stay but ""wow"" how they made it special. First there was an upgrade to a beautiful suite overlooking the park. Complimentry champagne (a bottlle not a glass). Fantastic room service. Try the afternon tea it`s a must. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and everyone of them genuinely seemed happy to there. I would like to thank all of the staff for there kindness and congratulate the management in assembling a great team, they are an absolute credit to them and the company."
April 2010,"Fantastic hotel, amazing service!","My wife and I had one night at the Milestone Hotel away from our four kids. Before we went I rang the hotel and told them this would be our only time for each other away from the kids all year and the trip also marked our anniversary. From the moment we arrived the staff were so attentive and nice to us, and we recieved a free upgrade to an amazing room! They kept on bringing treats and were totally dedicated to giving us a good time. It was a really special break that really revived us and I have already strongly recommended the hotel to all our friends!"
May 2010,Amazing!,"From the moment that I entered the hotel I was taken care of like I was family.  The staff knew my name when I walked in, and went out of their way to make sure that everything about my stay was perfect.  I have stayed in many of the world's top hotels (such as Oberoi hotels in India, Peninsula and Four Seasons) and this is one of the best.  I had a Deluxe Queen room and it was very spacious with a nice sized bathroom.  To help fight jetlag the staff let me borrow a DVD, and even looked up when a favorite show of mine was on TV.  They also offered to send up tea,  and of course the wake up calls were accompanied with complimentary tea or coffee.  I had breakfast included in my rate and it was wonderful.  I wish I had eaten in their restaurant for dinner as the food looked…"
April 2010,The Very Best,"My husband and I have stayed in 5 star hotels all over the world.  If there was a way to give The Milestone more than 5 stars - I would give them 15.  It is quite possibly the best hotel I have ever stayed in London or anywhere else.   We had arrived in London at 7am, after flying all night, and I called the hotel to see if we could check in early.  I was told - Why, of course - and when we arrived, the doorman greeted us by name, they had breakfast for us, and our room was ready for early check-in.  The room was large and beautiful, with amenities I have never seen anywhere else, like a silver case holding cards printed  with my name and all the hotel information to give out while I was staying in London.  Every little thing that we might need was thought of - scissors and tape…"
December 2009,Loved this hotel,"My husband booked this hotel as a birthday surprise so I can’t make any comment about value for money, however I can agree with previous reviews that this is a special hotel.  From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we had the complete attention of the staff, we had a fantastic welcome and check in with Terry providing a tour of the hotel that would give any museum guide a run for their money.   We were up graded to a fabulous suite, there seemed to be an endless supply of complementary champagne, the public rooms were lovely, food and breakfast excellent and venue perfect overlooking Kensington Park.    The hotel was five stars all the way but I would like to comment on the one point that made this hotel stand out above ALL others we have stayed in.  I have a really bad neck…"
April 2010,Storybook Christmas,"What can you say about the Milestone that hasn't already been said? It is a lovely, perfectly British boutique hotel, well-deserving of accolades. It is decorated with taste and elegance. The parlor is a cozy library, and the conservatory is a delightful place for tea with a bubbling fountain, the bar is a tartan and leather retreat. The rooms are beautiful and unique, decked out with all the small accessories and toiletries a 5 star hotel should have. As most other reviewers have said, it is the staff that made our stay so outstanding. From our daily server in the dining room, to the assistant food manager, Mr. Otto, to Terry the Butler, to the front desk staff, all were eager to help with whatever a guest needs to make their stay memorable. For us, they even went out and…"
April 2010,5 star service and comfort,"My Wife has just returned from a 2 night stay at this hotel with our daughter, from check in to check out She was delighted with the service and quality, we have stayed at no41 previous which is just as good, My Wife will return soon with our other daughter to enjoy all that London and this hotel has to offer, many thanks to all the staff at the Milestone for looking after them and making it a special stay."
March 2010,"Great service, problems with breakfast","Fantastic staff on reception and throughout the hotel. All rooms offer a different theme. We had the Jungle Room which had a balcony. Very clean and comfortable, but bed wasn't huge. Stayed in for dinner in the restaurant which was exceptional. Breakfast was not as good though. There were 10 of us and only one member of staff so some of food was cold and the staff member smelled strongly of b.o. Not pleasent but overall enjoyed the stay."
March 2010,Best Hotel Ever,"Shame about the review below about the apartment but you have to say as you find and my wife and I found this hotel to be one of the best we have ever stayed in. On arrival, Terry made us feel like royalty throughout the one night stay we had (Shame he's retiring in July!). Showing us round was a great touch but its' the little things that make it so special - lighting a candle in the bathroom for when we got back, a little history book on chocolate, complimentary drink on arrival, the list is endless. The cooked breakfast was wonderful and served with a smile. We were watching a show at the Royal Albert Hall, so it was perfectly postioned. This part of London is quite upmarket but we will DEFINETELY be coming back here when we come back to London. Thanks really to all the staff…"
February 2010,disappointing,"We were coming to London, read the reviews on Tripadvisor recommending this hotel and decided to splurge.  The apartments photos looked lovely and most of the reviews were very enthusiastic.  And since we were coming for 23 days we wanted to be comfortable, with the convenience of a kitchen.  I had pictured having our friends over, for drinks, a bite to eat.  No way that could happen.  We wouldn't have been able to fit.  And I'm not talking about hordes.  I'm talking about two more people for an hour or so.    We were disappointed, to say the least.    They put up in apartment 6, up in the attic, a little rabbit warren of a place, which was hard enough for me, having to make my way around the living room with my head cricked at a slant, and couldn't sit at the kitchen table…"
March 2010,I feel sorry for those people who never get to stay here!,"This is how I would run a hotel, there was nothing that could have improved our stay. I was a bit worried because I wondered if it would be stuffy and I would feel uncomfortable - this could not have been further from the truth. From the minute we arrived we felt special and genuinely valued and wanted as guests, I think I only said my name upon check in and then every member of staff knew who we were - amazing. The little touches made the whole stay really special and I feel myself welling up thinking about the amount of times I was wowed. I wont go in to much detail as it will spoil it for future guests but I would be shocked if anyone gave less than a rave review. The personal touch is what we have lost these days as we go about our daily business and do we really listen to…"
September 2009,as good as it gets,"My family and I had the pleasure of a four night stay at the Milestone in March of 2010.  We book through American Express when possible.  The agent steered us to a hotel down the street, and upon arrival, we figured it made sense to check out the Milestone, which was my wife's first choice.    From the moment we set foot in the hotel, the staff treated us with courtesy and respect.  We were given a tour of the property and quickly decided to retrieve our belongings from the other property and check in for the duration of our stay.  We chose a suite with two levels.  The room was beautifully decorated, exceedingly clean, and comfortable.   The upstairs room had a sofa bed, television, small pool table, and half bath. Perfect in all respects.  The bathroom was roomy and elegant. …"
March 2010,Simply class.,"Stayed last year at this hotel although not sure exactly when! Been meaning to write a review for sometime.  Ok you know as soon as you walk into the hotel its a different level as your greeted by name. Very friendly gentleman showed us around the hotel which is always nice particularly as the Milestone seems to have some history. Once we were shown to our room it was made clear that if we needed anything no matter what then please ask, even if it meant a room service item or meal that wasnt on the menu. Room was very comfortable if slightly small although i think we may of just got a little unlucky with that. I liked the location of the Hotel. Turn right and have a nice stroll down the road and you will be in the middle of the main shopping areas harrods etc. Concierge were…"
April 2008,The Milestone is PERFECT!,"I have stayed at five star hotels all over the world and The Milestone is really at the top of my list!  I did extensive research prior to my stay and landed on the Milestone.   I was more than pleased and could not have been any happier with every aspect of this hotel.  Upon check-in, I was given a tour of the hotel and all the amenities by the hotel butler.  In addition, we were offered a complimentary drink at the hotel bar while the room was being prepared (we arrived early).   In about 15 mins, the room was ready and the butler showed us to the room.  I purchased a king room and it was very nice.   That being said, the butler indicated that the hotel was not full and that upgrades were available if we were interested.   They showed us to a suite and offered it to us for…"
February 2010,In Love With The Milestone,"My husband and I were in London for a spring wedding, and for this particular visit, we chose to stay at the Milestone. It has had tons of buzz in the travel industry and every client I sent there myself came back with rave reviews. Having stayed at many of London's top hotels, I had high expectations and the Milestone blew me away. Our room was upgraded at no extra cost, and it was an upgrade like none I have ever had before. Our suite was hidden behind a fake bookcase and our room was bi-level with a spiral staircase and a sprawling balcony overlooking Kensington Park. The decor was tasteful and welcoming with warm colors and a spread of books for us to enjoy. On the top level, the walls had been painted to look like an antique library full of books and there was a snooker…"
February 2010,Marvelous Boutique Hotel,"I spent four nights here with my young daughter.  This hotel is splendid.  I can see why it has such high TripAdvisor ratings.  First of all, the decor is WONDERFUL.  This is a Victorian building that has been lovingly renovated in the full-on English ""we love patterns"" sort of way.  If you need Japanese zen decor to relax, don't stay here.  But if you want to feel like you are in England, and you enjoy elegant & cozy decor with lots of throw pillows and warm fires and cozy nooks and fresh flowers, you will love it here.  We stayed in the Viscount Suite (a junior suite), which was gorgeous and overlooked Hyde Park.  What is really special about this hotel is all the thoughtful details they put in your room.  The room desk, for example, is stocked like your desk at home--it even…"
February 2010,Understandable How the Milestone Rates # 1 with Conde Nast,"Just returned from a 6 night stay at the Milestone.  Close to everything is tops at this hotel.  Service is comparable to the George V with a friendlier tone. Markus the bartender in the lounge was superb.   The rooms are luxurious and spacious for old European hotels.  We used the Amex fine hotels and resorts program and were upgraded.  We experienced 2 rooms at the hotel.  Ours weren't as spacious as the Honolulu poster but were ample enough to fit a cot for our teen and still have plenty of walking room.  Both of our rooms were considered suites but were really large rooms. However, they were ample for a European City Hotel.  Bathrooms were updated but in Victorian period style. The location of the hotel is perfect for a family traveling with teens and children.  Kensington…"
February 2010,All it says it is....,"Stayed at the Milestone for one night on the 13th February - had booked it ages ago when I bought tickets for the Royal Opera House.  I have stayed in lots of expensive hotels, but this is the most pricey at £380 per night and did not include breakfast.  All the reviews are correct, the staff are friendly and nothing is too much trouble - parking our car, carrying bags etc., and on returning from the ballet the barman found me some chocolates ( I think he might have stolen them from a member of staff!)  The room on the 6th floor was beautifully decorated and it lacked nothing - I can normally find one little gripe but admit I was unable to this time.  It was all lovely - but I still find it hard to justify the expense unless you are mega wealthy or it is a very special…"
January 2010,"Disappointing, completely overpriced","As a connoisseur of 5 star hotels worldwide, and a marketing specialist, I know quality. In my opinion, attention to detail is what makes a hotel memorable or forgettable.. There were several disappointments at this hotel, however the staff are absolutely superb, and were very accommodating.  Whilst the suite itself was sumptuously decorated, (Prince Albert Suite) and very suitable, there were problems one after another.  I had called ahead an hour before to let the concierge know my flight had changed and I would be arriving earlier, to please re-arrange the chauffeur and suite. When I arrived, tired and cold from a very shoddy flight, I was asked to wait, as the room was not ready. I was gracious, not wanting to be a bother, however I was still waiting an hour and a half…"
November 2009,first class stay,"we arrived at the milestone on propbably the coldest snowy day you could imagine, but once inside the hotel the reception we got from the hotel staff was so warning they were very friendly and even wished me a happy birthday, they had remembered from the booking.  We were shown to our room which was beautiffuly decorated and very luxurious by a lovely gentleman from the hotel, who hung our coats and gave us the usual tour, he shortly returned with a birthday cake, 2 glasses of champagne and a card, compliments of the hotel.  The breakfast was good, the restraunt food was wonderful not cheap but they offered a theatre menu which was good value.  I would highly recomend this hotel, the staff could not do enough for you to make your stay memorable.  A truly award winning hotel."
February 2010,Impeccable service,When we first arrived at the Milestone we were greeted by a small dark lobby the reminded me of a Irish bar. However our frets were soon dissolved as we were warmly greeted at the check in. We were given our room of choice and were quickly finished.  Then our butler asked if we would like a tour and we accepted and were shown the restaurants and lounges in the hotel. while this occured we had all of our luggage taken to our room and played in an area where it was easily accesibly. Along with the newspaper from home and the special iron we had asked for.   Chenstons restaurant The reastarant had amazing service. Having eaten at many 5 star establishments this went above and beyond what was exptected. It was a tiny restaurant with around 10 tables. The food arrived perfectly. i…
August 2009,faultless,"sumptuouse with being pretensious, friendly without being familiar.  On the coldest night ever recorded we arrived back at the Milestone after a short walk from an evening at the Royal Albert Hall to be greeted with open log fires, pots of hot chocolate, deep squashy sofas and a pianist playing discreetly in the lounge.  BLISS.  I cannot fault the Milestone  -  search the web for a fiive star hotel  -  beautifully situated overlooking Kensington Palace   -  offering a truly 'full English breakfast',champagne on arrival and a choice of daily newspaper all included in the price.  Afirst class hotel with first class staff  what more could you want.  Congatulations  ,"
September 2009,Fabulous hotel,"My husband, son and I stayed at the hotel for 6 nights in August. The staff could not possibly have gone to more trouble to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. Our room was beautiful. The location is fabulous being about a 5 minute walk from the tube with lots of restaurants within a two minute walk. We dined at a different one each night and did not have a bad experience. We dined one night in the hotel's small restaurant. It is quite romantic and food is very very good. This is a small intimate hotel. Both my husband and I received separate handwritten welcome notes from the manager. We will definitely be staying here again."
September 2009,Nice Hotel,Nice accommodations and a friendly staff.  Rooms clean. I would go back!
September 2009,One of the BEST HOTELS EVER!!!,"We would HIGHLY recommend The MILESTONE to anyone visiting London. Over the years we have stayed at some of the highest rated hotels and I would say this 1 outdid anyone's hospitality.  Not only the incredible hospitality included, this hotel is filled with exquisite personality.  2 nights at this superb hotel was not long enough!  Loved every minute and hope to be back to London in the near future!  What a terrific city!  Thank you!"
August 2009,Absolutely superb service and really nice accommodations,"My husband and I had the absolute pleasure of staying at the Milestone Hotel in September on our way to a cruise.  I can not find enough words to say how wonderful everything was.  The staff were extremely accommodating.  We had a suite which was decorated to perfection. We ate at the hotel almost all the time we were there and the food was terrific.  The butler service is a plus.  They really care.  They make the effort to know your name and ask if you are having a pleasant stay and they wrote a nice letter which we received when we returned from our cruise.  As others have said, it is conveniently located and we were able to walk to our favorite stores.  This is about our fifth time in London and really we would never stay at another hotel.  This hotel is not ""stuffy"" and it…"
August 2009,fantastic!!!,"what can you say about The Milestone?  Fantastic location, amazing staff and a great looking building.  The whole weekend we stayed at this hotel for my birthday was a weekend.  The staff were great to us and the overall service is better than any other hotel i have stayed at in London.  I would recommend the afternoon tea, but get it for one and share as it is huge.  I would fully recommend this hotel to everyone.   enjoy"
September 2009,Excellent,"We stated two nights and were totally pampered, We fed  well and the menu was everything we had asked for, and more.  Nothing was too much for the staff and they provided the little touches that made the stay something special.  We got married there and everything was perfect down to the smallest detail. The staff provided a service that was something to remember [ they are not paying me to say all this] .I would recommend a stay here if you want to that special hotel above the ordinary and we left feeling we must stay there again. Many thanks to the Milestone team for a wonderful stay."
September 2009,Highest Level of Service,"My sister found the Milestone on tripadvisor and the reviews were correct. We had a lovely stay beginnning with our arrival. Not only were we greeted by everyone in the lobby but the manager came out to welcome us and shake our hands. Pedro gave us a tour of the property along with both of our rooms. Each room was unique and of the highest quality. Service at the front desk, bar, restaurant and concierge was spectacular.  We were treated to breakfast each morning due to a website glich, were given welcome drinks upon our arrival. Each and every time we left or entered the hotel we were greeted by name and each person in the lobby helped us get a taxi, make reservations or just plain reccomended options. The turn down service was lovely and it felt nice to come home at night…"
May 2009,"Highest quality service, handsome property, excellent food","Attentive, gracious, and professional service in both the hotel and the excellent restaurant.  Lovely public rooms, we had a view of Kensington Gardens. It's a great location, peaceful and yet convenient. A very fine hotel.  Our only critique: our junior studio room was very crowded with more furniture than necessary, making it crowded and less than fully functional when you are travelling with luggage and need to unpack. Can't tell if that was an anomaly but notice another reviewer said the same."
August 2009,couldn't be bettered,"We arrived en masse at The Milestone for my grown-up Hen Weekend. It wasn't my first time there, so the luxurious, individualistic rooms were more familiar than awe-inspiring, this time around. The thing that sets The Milestone apart is the service. Staff joined in the atmosphere, bore our excitability with admirable patience and created special cocktails. I even learned the origin of the Milk In First snobbery, thanks to a personable member of the waiting staff. This is my perfect hotel; they have got it just right."
December 2009,Truly remarkable in every way,My husband and I stayed at this hotel for two nights prior to embarking our cruise ship.  Despite a rough arrival into Heathrow (Virgin lost one of our bags and our transfer reservation) all was forgotten the minute we stepped inside The Milestone.  We were greeted with warmth from everyone.  Even Andrew the hotel manager gave us a personal welcome.  Our room was inviting and very large compared to European standards.  Breakfast was included in our rate.  We ordered room service both  mornings and the order was perfect.  Loved the bar area.  Fabulous for a pre dinner cocktail or after dinner nightcap.  The concierge staff went out of their way to secure our lost luggage and confirm our return transfer with Virgin.  I can see why this hotel is rated #1 in all of London.  Very…
December 2009,Really Lovely Hotel,"Rooms are sweet with a bit of theme. Cosy for sure. Great location. Nicest staff. My only complaint is since it was christmas time they rent out many of the rooms for private functions so if your staying in the hotel you cant always be sure the bar will be free or the tea room etc. Other then that, a lovely lovely stay."
November 2009,Recomended but with minor reservations,"Just returned from an excellent stay at this outstanding hotel. Ideally suited for Kensington, Hyde Park, The Royal Albert Hall and a pleasant walk away from Harrods and Knightsbrige. Covent garden is a £15 taxi ride away, Piccadilly £10.  Staff are excellent and accommodating and the offering, value for money, however, the rooms and public spaces are small (or as we found it a cozy oasis) and the decor (which we liked) is way over the top, but I would suggest it was designed to be that way.  Perhaps the biggest let down was the food. Due to lack of covers you are encouraged to eat at least breakfast in your room, which on the second and third day we tried out of interest (though there had been nothing wrong with the service in the restaurant). It was OK though a lack of chairs…"
November 2009,Making life easy.,"The family trip to London was made 'worry free' by the staff at The Milestone. Arrangements and theatre bookings were made over the 'phone with staff who cared. From the moment we arrived, we were treated as people and not room numbers. Every member of staff wanted us to have an enjoyable stay at their hotel and worked together to make it so. We will be going back to The Milestone in the summer and I am recommending this friendly hotel to all my friends. Thank you Milestone staff and see you soon."
September 2009,Outstanding in every way,"Stayed at the Milestone during November - this was this was the fourth Red Carnation Hotel we have stayed having previously visited 41, Montague on the Gardens and the Chesterfield. The Milestone did not disappoint and maintained the high standards of this hotel group. We were upgarded to the Venetian Suite as it was my wifes birthday,a  complimentary bottle of champagne provided but more importantly the level of personal service and attention was outstanding. From the moment we walked through the hotel entrance the staff could not have been more attentive  to our every need. If you want to enjoy a little luxury then then this is the hotel for you - another memorable visit for all the right reasons"
November 2009,Little England,"Not to repeat what the other reviewers very rightly pointed out,  this place deserve praises. However, it works on a concept : a certain take on English lifestyle.  You may love it or find it quaint and slightly annoying. To sum it up: Perfect for Mrs Benett (Elisabeth Benett's mother) but wrong for Mr Darcy."
December 2009,Fantastic hotel and amazing staff,"This was my second stay at the Milestone hotel and I can honestly say it was another fantastic experience. The staff were very attentive and helpful and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable.  We stayed in one of the newly furbished rooms which was beautifully decorated.  Dinner in the restaurant was fantastic, the quality of food and service was superb, I will definitely be returning to the Milestone when I am next in London."
October 2009,Disappointed,"Pay attention to the 'average' reviews as this place is musty, old fashioned and like staying in a museum. Very overpriced and not good value for money - you'll feel cheated. Don't be fooled. Sorry to the staff who make an effort - the problem is the rooms and decor."
October 2009,Excellent service and location,We stayed at the Milestone Hotel for three days in October after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor. It was a great choice! The bedrooms are all different with lovely furniture and amenities. The food in the restaurant is excellent with knowledgeable and friendly staff  on hand. A good gym and the resistance pool  is  a huge bonus. It is the staff that make this hotel so special - they are welcoming and helpful without being obtrusive. The hotel is also in an excellent location for shopping and sightseeing. And don't miss the spa - the therapist is very good. We will definitely be staying at the Milestone again.
October 2009,"This hotel is quaint, warm and welcoming.","My husband, mother inlaw and I stayed 3 nights at this lovely hotel.  From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we were welcomed and felt at ease.  The staff was friendly and very helpful.  Our rooms were quaint and warm, one could not ask for anything as far as amenities went.  The turn down service included a lit candle on the side of the bath, it was such a nice touch that one could not help but to enjoy a long bubble bath.  The resuraunt is cozy and homelike and the food was wonderful.  We are looking forward to going there again in the future."
May 2009,Excellent service in a perfect location,This was my second stay at the Milestone.  It is a charming and truly exceptional hotel.  The service is excellent.  They cannot do enough for you.  Highly recommended.
May 2009,WONDEFUL VICTORIAN HOTEL WITH SUPERB SERVICE,I was visiting London for a few days at the end of May/June before meeting friends on a little cruise out of Southampton.  Picked the Milestone Hotel after hearing the Carnation Group which is based mostely in the UK was a hotel chain that gave the guest that little extra ++++.  I was not disappointed!  The Milestone was rather like stepping into a Dicken's novel with modern amenities and a great location. The architecture is lovely with great artistic attention to detail.  Especially fun is the atrium room just of the bar where the bartender in his white tux could probably mix any cocktail you desire and then double for the movie Casablanca.  My flight from California came in a about 8AM and after a taxi ride into London I was delighted to not only find my room ready but…
May 2009,Nothing but the best at this hotel,"Wouldnt think about stopping anywhere else again, staff, rooms, food, fitness centre were nothing but brilliant, we are on a few months trip visiting Europe, and this has been a treat"
June 2009,The Milestone Was Excellent,"We just had a great stay at the Milestone Hotel in London.  Although we arrived in the middle of the night, we were greeted warmly and called by name before we could introduce ourselves.  We were checked in quickly and provided with our favorite cocktail before we were given a brief tour of the hotel.  We were escorted to our room and given every comfort of home.  The next morning most of the staff greeted us by name.  The hospitality was truly remarkable.  We had an excellent dinner in the hotel resturant, try it for yourself.  We would stay there again and would recommend The Milestone to anyone."
May 2009,Incredible Hotel with all the little touches.,I stayed at the Milestone Hotel with my two daughters (23 and 17). The hotel is exceptional. All of the staff went out of their way to please us. Our room was beautiful and very comfortable. We were suprised each night with a different edible treat on our pillows. On top of that the hotel supplied a complementary bottle of water on each night stand. In our bathroom our housekeeper lit a candle by our bathtub...it would have been very romantic had my husband been with me. The bathrooms have a special light that stays on at night so that you can find the bathroom but it is not intrusive in the room while you are trying to sleep.. I was in the hotel business for many years and have been privy to some very special experiences but the Milestone tops the list .  We also loved the…
May 2009,superb quality 5star hotel,"My friend and I along with both our mom's sent the weekend at this hotel for a theatre break. Our original hotel The Rubens had overbooked us and transferred us at their expense to their sister hotel The Milestone, where credit to The rubens champagne awaited our arrival. The Milestone is in my opinion a superior hotel with excellent staff who can't do enough for you. The cleanliness and surrounds are also 5star quality and the staff enabled us to have a very enjoyable weekend. I would definately stay there again."
June 2009,The Milestone Hotel staff was wonderful.,"The location of this hotel was great - right across the street from Kensington Park.  We stayed in a two bedroom apartment...would not recommend the ""basement"" apartments, but one of those on the upper floors.  The staff was exceptional.  We would be happy to stay at the Milestone again!"
May 2009,Live up to its reputation,Stayed for two nights in late June.  The infrastructure and rooms are comfortable though not spectacular given the room rates. It is the good service in the hotel that goes beyond what we usually get in other 5 star hotels that makes the vital difference.  I would choose to stay in the hotel again.
June 2009,Truly Amazing,"I have stayed at many hotels in London and abroad for business and I can honestlly say this experience was absolutley outstanding. The staff are not just staff they are lovely people and as helpful as you will find anywhere. I had a 1 night stay (far too short) and would love to have stayed longer, and had my husband with me to enjoy the experience. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who loves excellent food and a very different hotel stay. I cant wait to go back."
June 2009,New Benchmark in Customer Service,"My last experience in London westayed in a suite at the Ritz and was thouroughly underwhelmed by the whole customer service experience let alone the cockroach in the bed! Now the Milestone, they know customer service! Our arrival began with a guided tour by Neil with his friendly excellent front of house skills immediately made you feel like one of the family. The guided tour of the Safari Suite was also excellent and I can thoroughly recommend this room for the fantastic way it is decorated and the view of Kensington Palace and Hyde Park. During our dinner at the charming Chenestons we were greeted by Andrew Pike, the General Manager who did more than merely introduce himself but really engaged us and once again we felt like one of the family, he even new this was the end of a…"
June 2009,An oasis of calm in a stressful world,"We chose the Milestone essentially for the proximity to the Royal Albert Hall but after spending 3 nights there we will never stay anywhere else when visiting London. We have stayed in a few five star hotels, the Milestone surpasses all of them. It's not in the least 'stuffy' because the staff, who are very attentive, seem to know when to be attentive which is an art most hotels don't get quite right. We wanted for nothing, nothing was too much trouble and we felt completly relaxed and regenerated after our stay.  The facitilies are good with a superb gym, there's a resistence pool which, although small, is perfectly formed. Our room was large for London standards, very comforatble with orginal art work on the walls. We ate in the restaurant one night and the food was delicious…"
May 2009,Treated Like Royalty,"My wife and 2 kids (8 and 4) just spent 7 nights at the Milestone in London.   We booked our vacation based on the high ratings the hotel has received, esspecially in Conde Naste.  We were not at all dissapointed.  Every second of our stay was wonderfull and we will remember this visit for years to come.   The hotel is located in Kensington across the street from Kensington Palace, the former home of Princess Diana and in a very high end neighborhood, comparable to Beverly Hills.  The hotel is a boutique hotel and has a lot of staff.  Most staff members know your name and greet you as you see them throughout the hotel.  We arrived early around 10am, the hotel sent a Mercedes to pick us up at Heathrow and allowed us to check in early.  We stayed in Apt. # 5.  As soon as we walked…"
May 2009,Our favourite London Hotel,"Needed a hotel within walking distance of the Royal Albert Hall. I have come to rely on Tripadvisor for guidance and we were not let down. Blissfully comforable, the room upgrade being an unexpected bonus, and being able to step across the road into Kensington Gardens was sheer delight. Can't wait to come again."
May 2009,Old British Excellence in Central London,We enjoyed a fantastic stay at this wonderful hotel. The staff were attentive and provided us with a guided tour of the hotel. The room was wonderful and such a change from the normal having so much character. The food was excellent and the afternoon teas are worth a visit just for the setting and food. The location is very central and all of London is easily accessable. We will be back to enjoy the hotel again - we recommend this hotel to all and we will be back!
May 2009,Highly recommendable,Me and my wife stayed at the hotel for three nights and were extremely pleased. The room was perfect and even better than you could expect. The staff were very attentive and made us feel like home. I will probably not stay in another hotel in London. There were so many small details that made a difference.
November 2008,Beautiful hotel in the best location in London,"I've stayed at the Milestone several times and never been disappointed.  The service is, like all the Red Carnation Hotels, fantastic and there's something about the ambience that gives the place a feel of a luxury country residence.  The location, opposite Kensington Gardens is wonderful and all things considered I'd say this is my favourite part of London.  All of the rooms are beautifully and it seems individually designed and furnished.  The food is fantastic with a high class restaurant and a discreet bar which I reguarly use for entertaining clients or friends when in London.  If you want a laid back and high class hotel experience in London this is the hotel for you.  It's got real class."
May 2009,an amazing refuge that totally restored us all,"Every minute spent here was worth every penny, arriving dishevelled exhausted, soaking wet with a baby and all her paraphenalia in tow, the staff swept us up with such  warm and genuine care that we soon fell in love with the hotel.  A hotel is more than fixtures and fittings and though gorgeous in every way to look at, and very comfortable to sleep in, it was the staff that makes this place so special, from manager to cleaners all staff on every level were outstanding. I've been to some posh hotels with my baby and been made to feel like a leper, not so here, where i was made to feel as though she were a vip."
April 2009,"I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough""",My husband and I visit London every 'term' to visit our son at University and it is important to us to stay somewhere well recommended and where the service and standard is very good.  We have found this with the Red Carnation Group of Hotels-small and intimate where it is the staff's priority to make your stay with them as pleasurable as possible.  No one request is too much and all the staff are so friendly and polite.  The standard of the room at The Milestone was wonderful and we stayed in a beautiful Venetian themed room.  We were welcomed with a glass of champagne and the bar area was delightful to use later.  The canapes served -delicious in the bar and also those brought to our room.  Having stayed at the Ritz- The Milestone and Hotel 41 deserve their Trip Advisor…
April 2009,"Lovely, friendly, awesome service","Had a power trip to london--20 hours in london and 2 transatlantic flights sandwiching it and stayed at the milestone in my few hours there. Staff was so friendly--brought me a latte as soon as I arrived. Hotel was lovely--wish I'd had more time to enjoy the gym, the spa, the restaurant, the tea room. My room was tiny but that's london.  Everything was impeccable and cozy.  They left me fruits and even had an American electric outlet for my laptop.  They really do think of all the little things. The location of the hotel is awesome--right across from Hyde Park and close to all the shopping.  Hotel is a bit expensive but that's why it's a business hotel. It is worth a splurge for a personal stay.   I wish I'd had them print out my boarding pass for Gatwick like they'd offered…"
April 2009,A truly lovely experience enjoyed by three generations.,"A lovely hotel, a warm welcome by friendly and very helpful staff, super rooms and great service. We look forward to going back."
August 2008,The Best Hotel I've Stayed In for a Long While,"After staying at The Milestone, everywhere else seems to pall into insignifigance. The staff are absolute perfection - nothing is left to chance. The rooms are very well appointed and the beds almost too comfortable. The bar and restaurant are delightful. I cannot recommend this hotel enough - it's the gold standard by which I'll judge hotels for a very long time to come."
June 2008,Superb!!,"Stayed at the Milestone in August and had the best experience for  a very long time. We travel frequently and visit London often and wanted to try the Milestone. The location is fantastic, right in the middle of Kensington and overlooking the beautiful Kensington Gardens. We arrived and the first thing you notice is how wonderful the staff are, they are genuinely friendly and seemed to really care about us. From the doorman to the gentleman who gave us a guided tour and offered us a complimentary glass of champagne,  to the ladies who serviced our room, everyone just couldn't do enough for us. Our room was beautifully decorated, I believe newly refurbished as well,  room 502 with a lovely four poster bed. The room was spotlessly clean and the evening turn down service was superb…"
August 2008,OK - friendly but not efficient,"We booked to stay one night as a birthday treat for my partner.  There were various personal reasons why we chose the Milestone and our expectations were high.  The service was friendly, though not always efficient.  We had a Junior suite which overlooked the park at the front of the hotel which was a lovely outlook, and whilst not quiet wasn't as noisy as many complain of - this is central London!  Our room wasn't ready on arrival so we did have to wait in the pleasant lounge.  The room was fun, with an interesting theme and well decorated and clean.  The bathroom was out of a different era though (it turns out they have revamped many of the rooms but not the bathrooms - it shows!).  We used the spa and it was good.  I had ordered a romantic turndown (rose petals on the bed,…"
July 2008,Tired,"Firstly, let me say the location is fantastic - if you love being situated on a large open park in the middle of London, an easy cab / tube ride from anywhere interesting.  The service at the hotel is a little oppresive, so for most people it could be regarded as highly favourable.  The building and decor are tired, or quaint, depending on one's perespective.  Our room was tiny, to be polite, stuffed with unnesessary furniture in decor that boarded on kitch.  There was a definite smell of sewage everytime we entered our, overly-compact, room.  You'd attribute this to the 'quaintness', read old-world-ness, of the hotel.  For the price I would have to say pay marginally more and stay at a modern, more up-market, establishment in Park Lane.  Not impressed."
July 2008,Not for Seasoned Travelers,"While most of the reviews of the Milestone have been excellent, I beg to differ.  I found the hotel to be stuffy, old fashioned and appropriate only for first time travelers to the UK.  I much prefer the Baglioni a few doors down (fully booked this timer).  The rooms had too much furniture and tschokes all over the place.  The bar was full of blue haired laddies.  The service stifiling.  The resistance pool was OK and the location is good.  A great place to bring Aunt Edna for her first trip to the UK."
July 2008,beautiful place to stay...,"We loved staying at the Milestone Hotel.. very English and the staff is very helpful.  Our room was small but very elegant and extremely clean.  We had a beautiful view of Hyde Park... which is also the side where the street is, but surprisedly it was quiet. Actually, I specifically noticed things in the hotel, and everything is well taken care of and clean.   My daughter and I had breakfast in our room every morning, the food was good but somewhat expensive.  Pretty much the food in London was expensive.  We ate dinner in the restaurant one evening, it was good and the service was good too.  I would definitely recommend this hotel, good location... great staff and beautiful rooms... we will stay here again."
June 2008,Fantastic but,We have stayed at 5 star hotels all over the world and for service this was one of the best. The staff could not do enough for you. Gavin concierge was excellent.Complimentary tea when we arrived at 11.30 pm and impeccable service throughout our stay. Our only gripe was that our room (311) was facing the road and there was some traffic noise (some sort of intererior glazing would fix) also there was a creaking floorboard in the room above that the guest kept walking over until 1 am that was annoying. All in all if you want a class hotel that lives up to its status then this is it.
June 2008,A gem,"Just an ideal London boutique hotel.  The right size--so that all amenities are available, the right staff--warm and welcoming, and the right location--overlooking Kensington Park.    Our duplex room decorated like a library featured a billards table/dining table (you'd need to see it) and upstairs living area that served as our children's sleeping area.  Bathroom was well appointed (though I find those European shower enclosures frustrating).  Everynight candy and canapes were delivered and the turn-down service was excellent.  Comfy beds. The roll-away beds need some looking after as a couple of them were missing slats. Breakfasts were classic british or continental as you choose.  A sweet little bar/conservatory area make a nice nook for a drink or tea.    My only significant…"
May 2008,The best hotel we have ever stayed at,"Originally I booked this as it was the closest to the Royal Albert Hall as we were going to a concert there.  What a find, nothing was too much trouble and all the staff were very helpful.  Terry showed us around the hotel and our room.  The afternoon tea we had was huge and lovely, the cakes and scones we could not finish they sent up to our room for later.  The room itself was excellent decorated in a victorian theme.  After the concert we came back and sat in the lounge and was entertained by a person singing and playing the piano who was excellent.  Overall a wonderful place that makes you feel special.  Much better than the Ritz which we stayed at the week before and not as pricy."
April 2008,The Most Pleasant Expreience!,"My husband and I just returned from a long weekend at The Milestone May 15-19th.  The hotel is completely charming. The staff is very friendly and accomodating, especially Neil at the concierge, who helped us with restaurant reservations and even offered to personally check out the table at our restaurant before we got there to make sure it was appropriate for us!    Speaking of restaurants, you must try Ffiona's just a few blocks away - what a delicious meal!!  We stayed in a superior double room with a clear view of Kensington Palace  The room was very cozy, nicely decorated and comfortable.  The bathroom was spacious and spotless.    The hotel really feels like a home away from home.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone!  I can see why it remains at the top reviewed by…"
November 2008,Best Hotel Experience in Many Years,"My wife and I stayed in the Milestone Hotel for 4 days while visiting London for our daughter's grad school graduation.  We booked a Superior King room and were delighted upon receiving an upgrade upon arrival.  I travel frequently for both business and personal reasons, and I am very demanding when it comes to service and accomodations. The Milestone exceeded my requirements and expectations in all categories. All members of the staff greeted us by name without exception, including upon our exit from the cab upon arrival, and they were quick to offer assistance and suggestions to meet our every need.  They were the most attentive and friendly hotel professionals that we have encountered in our extensive world travels over a period of many years.  Their personal touch was most…"
November 2008,Impeccable Experience at the Milestone,"I have waited a bit to write this review, because I wanted all of my thoughts about The Milestone to synthesize before I merely gushed ceaselessly.  Having travelled and stayed in every major ""brand"" luxury hotel, e.g., Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, St. Regis, etc., I have never had as uniformly wonderful experience as we enjoyed at The Milestone.  First, we were upgraded to a Master Suite as an absolute surprise.  We did not ask for an upgrade, and we did not expect an upgrade.  A tremendous first impression.  Second, one expects at 500 pound plus per night that the staff will be courteous, welcoming, and helpful. However, the staff at The Milestone, from reception, the concierge staff, the butler staff, the dining room staff, to housekeeping was exceptional.  Each knew the name…"
October 2008,Excellent,"Just returned from a short overnight stay at the Milestone Hotel London.  I must say how friendly, helpful and efficient the staff were. My husband had surprised me with a theatre trip and an overnight stay in London for my birthday. We had a great time made extra nice by the hotel staff.  We were met on our arrival by a man called Terry who was very helpful, who showed us all around the hotel. Our room was lovely, immaculate, spacious and comfortable. We had breakfast in the restuarant which I must say the scrambled egg was the best I had ever tasted!! Again the staff were brilliant. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting quality and comfort with a great atmosphere. I would certainly return in the future."
September 2008,Loved Apartment One,"Everything was exactly as described on the hotel website. Wonderful accomodations and fantastic service. I can't speak highly enough of the friendly and helpful staff. It really did feel like our own home during our stay. The private entrance was especially appreciated and the location of the hotel really made us feel safe. We stayed for 10 nights and after a day full of sight-seeing and walking, it was a true pleasure to walk through the door and relax in front of the fireplace. We spent three days in Paris and the hotel was gracious enough to keep a huge piece of luggage for us so we didn't need to mail it back early. This was our first trip to London and I spent three weeks researching hotels before deciding on the Milestone. I wouldn't consider staying anywhere else on my…"
August 2008,A charming and cozy hotel!,"Wonderful hotel, great room, very comfortable bed, super room ameniities, good breakfast and outstanding service. Great massage at the spa!"
May 2008,Wonderful!,"We stayed here for 4 days precruise in early August.  It was really one of the best hotel experiences we have had anywhere (and we travel  quite a bit).  We arrived early and were not only allowed to check in but were upgraded to the fabulous Safari Suite. The attention to detail from all the staff is over the top,  I am amazed that anyone would give this beautiful hotel 3 stars!  The breakfasts were divine and the high tea quite an experience for SoCal folks.  NO request was to small to be handled promptly and with grace, We did not have dinner or a drink in the bar (although it was very charming).  The area is close to the tube, various museums, Hyde Park, Kensington Palace (across the street). Lots of shopping in the neighborhood.    We did a very nice package on Luxury Link…"
August 2008,The Best Hotel I Have Stayed In . . .By A Mile!!!,"This hotel had my boyfiend and I so impressed, we still talk about it! We had a concert at the Royal Albert Hall wich was a 5 minute walk from the hotel (it's situated on the same road!!) and with the perfect position, opposite the park it was iddylic.  From the moment we arrived we had a warm greeting and noticed all of the fresh, signiture red carnations. They were in the lift, our room, on the room service trays and in every member of staff's button holes. Lovely touch.  Our room was split level on the second floor and was very cosy. All the little 'extras' you could imagine putting into a room, they did. Stationery, slippers, extra towels and the smelly's were gorgeous.  We only spent one night here, didn't see the bar or use the restaurant or pool but we did order room…"
August 2008,WOW,"Oh WOW!!!!  My partner booked this as a surprise.  We stayed in a fabulous room with a four poster bed and a wonderfully luxurious feel. (I think it was the Tudor suite?)  I almost wished it were winter so we could have lit the fire and sat in the snug area!  Terry the butler was a great guide to the hotel and the local area. He was entertaining as well as informative.    We went down to the bar for pre-dinner drinks, Daniel the barman was so welcoming and Stephan offered us Champagne ""It's Champagne day every day at the Milestone!!"" .... Just fantastic and lovely nibbles, I would have been happy to have stayed in the bar all night.      Dinner in Cheneston's was a wonderful experience, what a lovely setting.  I have never felt so important and special, and not just how my…"
July 2008,Not a five star hotel,"I really don't know who writes these reviews. I have been to many hotels around the world and this is certainly not a five star hotel!  First of all when we entered the hotel, the floor was squeaking, first time for me in the hotel experience. When we entered our room I gave the man who accompanied us a big tip and told him to empty the mini-bar which he promised to do but didn’t, in fact I never saw him again during our stay.  The room was very small for the price we paid which was 550$ a night! and seeing that this hotel is very small by itself I don’t know how it got a five start rating! Maybe a five star in the small hotel category.  The curtains and the bed covering all smelled nasty like they never been washed before and when I tried to take a shower, the shower head fell…"
August 2008,Superb Hotel,"I stayed at the Milestone with my sister last month as a birthaday treat to coincide with a matinee trip to the theatre.  I never imagined that it would be the highlight of the trip.The room was outstanding and was much larger than I had expected and over looked Kensington Palace which thrilled us. Neil on reception was efficient and courteous, and ordered us a tray of tea to be sent to the room, complete with delicious cookies, by a lovely chap called Paul.We decided on an early supper  then bed but this didn,t go as planned as we had such a good time. We ate at about 8pm and had Chicken Pot Pie and Chopped Aberdeen Angus steak and they were outstanding . We'd had nibbles in the bar served to us by a lovely guy (maresh?) and we glad we hadn,t ordered a starter. The wine waiter…"
June 2009,The most outstanding Hotel in the UK,"This hotel is fabulous, the location, the rooms and the food. But the service is first class. Terry the butler made our stay so special and Gavin on concierge went out of his way to arrange a personal itinerary so we got to see all the sights of this great city. Everyone made our trip to London very special - we were treated like royalty. Their afternoon tea is the best in London. We will definitely go back."
June 2006,The finest service I have ever experienced,"We stayed at the MIlestone for 6 days following a Mediterranean cruise. From the moment our car dropped us at the hotel, until the morning we left, we could not find fault with anything about this great hotel. Pedro and Abdi. whose vocation in life seems to be to ensure that guests at their hotel are relieved of stress completely, were attentive in the most professional way imaginable, friendly but not too much, informative but to just the right degree. These guys have been doing this a long time! The front desk was responsive. courteous, and on the ball. They knew exactly the  status of our room, and offered us an upgrade to a suite that was as elegant as could be( admittedly, they asked us if we would be willing to pay a little extrs for this -- it was worth every penny). I…"
August 2009,one of the top five hotels in london,"i'll cut it short...great ambience hotel,the perfect example of an old style english accomodation in a fantastic city like london!"
July 2009,Way overrated and an obsequious and annoying attempt at good service,"We spent two nights at the Milestone, at the end of a European trip.  We were drawn to the hotel by its location and the sterling reviews we read on Trip Advisor, to say nothing of the Conde Naste Traveller awards, etc that the hotel has received.  The location is indeed perfect, across the road from Hyde Park and Kensington Palace.  The building itself is charming, a beautiful old brick house converted to a hotel.  The hotel prides itself (and promotes itself) as service oriented, but therein lies the rub.  It is one thing to have good service, it is quite another to have service that is obsequious and annoying, to the point of being nearly childish.  Somehow, the hotel management got it into their heads that presenting a cartoon version of Merry Old England, would appeal to…"
April 2009,Wonderful location for kids,"We spent a few nights at The Milestone and loved every minute of it.  The location is great -- right across the street from Kensington Gardens, which is so nice if you have kids who need some air.   It's close to the Princess Diana playground, Whole Foods, Le Pain Quotidien, and the Tube.  The staff were so kind and extremely helpful.  We immediately felt welcome.  Will definitely come back."
July 2009,Great hotel,"I really enjoyed my 4 night stay here. I stayed in a beautiful little room with whose décor recalled a different era. The hotel has real character and staying here was a luxurious experience.  The friendly staff were knowledgeable and extremely helpful, the service offered was among the best I’ve ever received. The restaurant food was generally excellent, and the breakfast was good. Free wifi is always a bonus. The hotel is a bit away from most of London’s best nightlife (except the Royal Albert Hall which is a 5 minute stroll) but transport is fairly easy with tube and buses nearby, and of course taxis are plentiful. Overall this place is first rate."
June 2009,Wonderful Experience,"Stayed at the Milestone with my adult daughter for 4 nights while on a trip through Europe.  (July 14th - 17th).  We loved this hotel.  We had their breakfast buffet included in the cost of our room and I have to say, what a great way to start the day.  The food and service was really a bonus.  (They did charge us for the breakfast but when we brought it to their attention that it was included with our room fee they took it off immediately)  Their staff was very accomodating and friendly with hailing taxis, directions with the tube, etc.   One of the most comfy beds I have slept in for a hotel in a long time with complimentary slippers and 2 types of robes.  The turn down service at night with a candy on our pillows and a lighted candle in the bathroom was a nice touch. …"
June 2009,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful location, attentive service - we will return","It was our first visit to London, our travel agent recommended the Milestone.  We loved the hotel,!  The location is close to Kensington Palace and we walked just a few blocks to the Underground for transportation to all of the tourist spots in London,   Our rooms included a full English breakfast, and the food was wonderful.  We were especially pleased with the attentive staff.  The rooms were clean and well appointed (not large).  The spa and pool area is well maintained and our 11 year old twins enjoyed a swim at night prior to bed.  Several wonderful cafes and stores close by. We stayed 5 days and each day was a pleasure.   After we left we discovered a missing I-touch and the staff was very helpful in returning to us.  We don't usually post reviews, but want to share this…"
June 2009,Marvelous Milestone,"This first stay at the milestone and won’t be our last.  On my wife’s suggestion we decided to try the milestone.  Usually we stay at Claridges or The Westbury.  We booked through American Express travel and benefited from a half board deal.   The front of house staff at reception were very attentive upgrading us on arrival and advised us that our room was ready immediately.  On arrival we were looked after by Pedro (thank you) who made us feel very welcome. He showed us the facilities explaining where everything was located.  A complementary glass of champagne then followed. This was very nice!  The room was very well presented and spotless, bathroom was a little small but immaculate.  The room benefited from fee wireless internet access which was great.  The breakfast and…"
July 2009,Just Fab in London,"We spent 3 nights at the Milestone during Wimbledon and had a hard time leaving. From the minute we entered , saw the Minstinguette suite and read that we were staying in a former Insane Asylum, we were in love with the hotel. More than a hotel, it felt that we were staying in somebodys carefully cultivated townhouse. Service in the restaurant as well as room service was impeccable and very personal. Everybody knew our names. We used the hotels LandRover from travel to Wimbledon as well as to the airport, the whole experience was executed to the finest detail."
April 2009,"Outstanding, outstanding, outstanding","Perfect in every way.  One night they even kept the restaurant open just for us.  Great accomodations, extra touches, fabulous service - superb in every way.  Won't hesitate for a second about coming back!!"
April 2009,Wendys 60th Birhday celebration.,"We love the Milestone !  Having stayed at the hotel several times over the past few years our last stay was the best ever, from the greeting by the uniformed doorman, the car is whisked away and the expeirience begins.  Welcome back to the Milestone is the greeting from  all of the staff. Quickly  we are in our room and offerd a welcome drink , the room is spotless and recently refurbished  and has a view of Kensington Palace. We took a short walk in to Kensington and explore the shops , so many to choose from. Dinner in Chenestons restaurant,  wonderfull roast lamb fresh from the trolley cooked to perfection and followed by the Milestone quartet sweet. Good food served by people who care about service.  Having slept well in the king size bed we went for breakfast, the…"
April 2009,A Class For Service,"We have just come from a stay at the Milestone and I have to agree with the reviewers on the service.  Everyone is so nice and helpful.  They make everyone feel like an old repeat customer.    The rooms were beutiful and homey, but could run a bit on the crowded side.  You should just be sure you know the room you are booking because they can be quite different.    The health club is small but it is sufficient  with a small pool quipped with jets to swim into.  The breakfast was small but tasty.    There were not that many extras in this hotel but it was so welcoming any drawbacks were made up for."
March 2009,Out of this world luxury and service!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My husband and I have just stayed at The Milestone in Kensington and cannot say enough how much we enjoyed our stay.  Upon arrival we were advised we had been upgraded to a suite which was pure luxury. We were given a personal tour of the hotel to show us all the facilities (including a pool and gym) and then taken to our room where we were welcomed with a glass of champagne. Our room was huge and overlooked Kensington Gardens and although the hotel is in the hub of everything it was so peaceful and relaxing. The room had everything you could want - wide screen wall mounted tv, cd and dvd player along with access to a library of cd's and dvds, huge 4 poster bed and luxurious bathroom.   Once unpacked, we enjoyed a delicious champagne afternoon tea. I have experienced many London…"
October 2007,A Dream Hotel,"The hotel where everything is important, a comfortable hotel yes, a luxurious hotel also, but what stood out for us was the care and attention of the staff, throughout this charming establishment the staff smile, they enjoy their work, they love their jobs,it shows when they speak to you, no forced smiles here.Yes it is on London terms a bit expensive,but British pound to the US Dollar, it is money well worth spent. We had planned an evening at the Albert Hall to see Carmen and to meet the stars beforehand and from the moment we walked into the Hotel nothing was too much trouble, Doormen, Waiters, Concierge, and the pleasant chap who took us around the Hotel showing us the Restaurant and the history of this charming establishment from early London times. We had nothing to…"
January 2009,The penultimate in hotel experiences,"My wife and I stayed in the Safari Suite on the layover on our trip home to LA from our African Safari.  From the minute when the hotel's Range Rover picked us up at Heathrow, we felt we were royalty.  The hotel accepted our extra luggage shipped from the states with our  evening clothes so we would not have to carry them all through the bush: they got us tickets to a West End show, arranged lunch at the British Museum Cafe, dinner reservations each night we were there.  The hotel restaurant was wonderful!  The little extra amenities, including tea every afternoon and the minibar selections were unsurpassed.  I have stayed at Four Seasons, Wyndham, Klimpton, Intercontinental, Chateau & Relais, and numerous other boutique and five star hotels, and I must say outside of some of…"
March 2009,Perfect 40th Birthday Party and Overnight Stay,"On the 24th of January this year (2009) I celebrated my 40th birthday at The Milestone Hotel with a private dinner for 34 people in the Windsor Suite. My Husband and I and our respective parents (as well as a few of the guests) also spent the night. We were given the Mistinguet Suite which has to be one of the most memorable rooms I have ever stayed in in a hotel. All in all the experience was fantastic.  From the initial booking and planning stage to the night itself, everything ran smoothly and was professionally coordianted by Stefan Otto, the F&B Manager. On the night itself, The Windsor Suite looked wonderful and the staff were fantastic – their attention to detail and their service were unsurpassable.   All our guests commented on the delicious food saying that the lamb…"
February 2009,just perfect.....exactly what we needed,"my wife and i were planning on a romantic weeekend getaway in London, we decided to stay in a beauitfully themed hotel, somewhere with individuallity, a certain special character... and i have to say i made the best decision in staying at the Milestone. our room overlooked the park, the theme was the Saville Row, beautiful and cosy, warm...breakfast was delicious and tasty, the fireplace by the lobby was extremely cosy. I have to admit i didnt praise the staff, because they deserve a salute, helpful, kind and always smiling, which added a nice personal touch to our stay. To be honest i think this is the hotel for me in london...  my advice.... ""stay at the Milestone"""
January 2009,Review of The Milestone Hotel,"The Milestone Hotel is my London home away from home.   I stay there each time I visit London for business.   It is such a lovely, traditional hotel.  I am treated with such warmth and grace from each and every member of staff and management, who know me by name.  The service is impeccable.  The Restaurants and Tea settings are intimate with old world service and attention.   The rooms are beautifully kept and updated with fresh fabrics and unique interior designs.  The facilities are just right.  I cannot rave enough about this fine hotel experience.    Sandra from Newport, Rhode Island"
March 2009,a totally amazing place to be,"From the moment we arrived at the door we were made to feel most welcome.  Everyone we encountered seemed to be working to make our stay perfect.  From the beautiful decor to the little treats and personal touches it was wonderful.  The room we had was stunning, large and comfortable.  The restaurant was fantastic and the bar and public areas very elegant.  The hotel is ideally situated for the Albert Hall, V&A, Natural History, Science Museums."
February 2009,Perfection.,"On a recent trip to London, I had the opportunity to stay at the Milestone for 3 wonderful evenings. I have never been more wowed by a property's staff, level of service or uniqueness. So, my review doesn't go on and on, I'll list what I felt were the highlights.  1.) From my corner room on the 4th floor (407), I had perfect views of Kensington Palace and surrounding park. 2.) When I arrived jetlagged but in a hurry to get to my next appointment, I took all of my things out of my bag and laid them on my bed as I didn't have time to hang them. When I returned even more tired, all of my things were hung in the closet for me.  3.) That evening, I called for a wakeup call and was greeted with ""would you like coffee with that"". Are you kidding - coffee WITH my wakeup call - that's a…"
January 2009,Outstanding in every respect,"From the moment we arrived at the Milestone Hotel, we were treated like royalty! The service we received from every single member of staff was outstanding. Nothing was too much trouble. The room was immaculate and had everything you could possibly need during your stay. The leisure facilities were also first class.  We chose to eat in Chenestons, the hotel restaurant, and the meal was amazing. We were introduced to a new wine which complimented every course perfectly."
December 2008,Pure luxury,From the moment we walked into the hotel we were treated like the only people in the world. Nothing was too much trouble. A very special place to stay. I had a massage on the morning I was due to leave. I needed somewhere to shower and change and my room had already been vacated. The staff found me a second room ( fully prepared for another guest) and allowed me to use it at no extra charge. Real old fasioned service. Thank you.
January 2009,the magical Milestone!,"The Milestone makes staying in London a pleasure. The hotel is wonderfully situated opposite Kensington Palace and well placed for Kensington High Street and a short trip from the West End etc.  The Milestone Staff are quite exceptional. Stephan in the restaurant is amazing - ask him for recommendations and prepared to be entertained!  The bar is very cosy and offers some amazing cocktails and twists on classic drinks. You'll not want for much when it comes to food or drink.  The service is exceptional.  My daughter left her hair straighteners at home (major challenge when you're a teen) so she asked if the hotel had any. Ten minutes later a brand new set arrived, no fuss, no additional comment that they had to buy them - just happy to help.  The Milestone is magic if you are in…"
January 2009,Outstanding Stay,"We recently enjoyed a wonderful 3 night stay at the Milestone.  The hotel is perfectly situated in Kensington, near many attractions.  Upon arrival, we were immediately upgraded to a fantastic suite overlooking Kensington Gardens across the street.  The staff was terrific from doorman to GM (who surprised us with two last minute tickets to Cirque du Soleil at the nearby Royal Albert Hall).  The breakfasts were excellent, as was the one dinner we had at Cheneston's.  I would definitely recommend and come back to on my next visit to London."
January 2009,Treat yourseld to a stay at this fab hotel,"We had the pleasure of staying at The Milestone last Saturday (24-01-09)  Without exception every member of staff that we encountered was courteous, polite and keen to ensure that we enjoyed our stay at the hotel.  We have already recommended the hotel to friends and would have no hesitation in re-booking the next time we stay in London."
January 2009,Le Cirque Package,"Had a great stay at The Milestone. There is a huge choice of luxury hotels and suites in West London, so for one to be voted by Conde Naste Traveller number one for service we thought it worth trying. The service, as expected was great. The staff were fantastic.  The best thing by far though was the ""package"" they put together for Cirque du Soleil at the Albert Hall.  Programme in your suite, Pre theatre meal, Bentley transfers Post theatre coffee and cognacs  5* hotel 5* package 3* prices. Great value"
January 2009,Treated Like Royalty,"My husband and I wish to express our thanks to the Management and Staff of the Milestone hotel and of  the Cheneston Restaurant for the warm welcome we received from all concerned. The food was delectable and the service impeccable.  Every member of staff whom we met was charming and helpful and all congratulated us on reaching our Golden Wedding Anniversary. It delighted us that the hotel where we spent our honeymoon fifty years ago should go to such pains to make our stay so special. For me in particular it was a joyous experience which I will remember always. I am certain my husband feels the same.   Thank you all,  Very Sincerely,  Sylvia A. Carruthers  (Mrs D. Carruthers)."
August 2008,Outstanding hotel,"I stay in London regularly on business and for pleasure.  I have used a wide range of hotels, mostly five star, including the Hilton Waldorf, the Grosvenor and Claridges.  The Milestone experience surpassed all of those in all respects.  The room was excellent, well thought out, and well equipped, right down to small items like scissors.  The decor was excellent, and, unlike so many large city hotels, showed no sign of age whatsoever.  The restaurant was superb, and a lovely size to maintain intimacy.  But like many places the experience depends on the staff, and here they are faultless.  Everyone was welcoming, helpful, friendly and knowledgeable.  It really was true that you felt like one of the family.  I will be returning, and it is unlikely now that I will use any other…"
December 2008,"The Milestone- Luxury, Intimacy and Character",One of my favourite boutique hotels in London. If you fancy a splurge get one of their suite rooms with the four poster beds. It feels like you are in genteel English country house. Great room design and bathrooms in a beautiful townhouse. Good service too.   Please note it is not a huge 5 star hotel so if that is what you are used to it may not suit. It is an old building with creaky floors and lots of character- and big on luxury.  The location is great next to Kensington Park. Make sure to walk up the Kensington Gardens road entered alongside the Garden Court Hotel (it looks closed to the public but in actual fact its only to non-authorised cars. Very interesting mansions and ambassadorial residences (including the most expensive house ever sold - to Lakshmi Mittal- prior to…
April 2008,Excellent,"We have stayed in many hotels in  London but this one has got to be the best. What more can I say it was excellent in every way especially the very freindly professional staff, will definatly stay here again."
March 2008,A haven where the staff care,"A supprise weekend right up to the moment the car pulled up outside the front door. The doorman was there welcoming us (not like the Baglioni) and taking the luggage before you could say Jack Flash. Once inside my partner checked in whilst i chatted with one of the very knowledgable butlers. Once he assertained where we had travelled from he knew who we were without the list. A quick and friendly check in and we were then given the grand tour whilst on route to the Jungle Room. We met and were introduced to most of the F@B staff who would look after us over the next two days.  Well what can i say it was like being a long lost friend, all the  staff knew who we were (just a couple up in town from cornwall) and their willingness to look after everyone with passion and flair was…"
February 2008,Mind the Gap!,"It was our frist trip to England and I was there with my wife to celebrate my birthday, But London is cold at this time of the year...who cares, never been there and had to make it special. London is magical, feeling like Peter Pan although I'm older, I felt like a kid entering Disneyland for he first time, never felt tired until the end of the day, after a day of walking, sightseeing, watching shows at west end, shopping, and dining...but to end my day on my goose down king size bed and pillows just made resting a much different level. The Milestone did not idsaapoint at all even thought they were doing construction during the day, the noise above me at one time was just not tolerable..but any old hotel with so muh character will show its age...and will need upkeep. The room…"
February 2008,Unforgettable,"My girlfriend and I were lucky enough to stay at the luxurious Milestone Hotel, Kensington. We were collected from Liverpool street station in a Bentley by Terry our butler and Keith our chaffer and given a guided tour of London on the way to the Milestone. The stay at the hotel was outstanding and we found EVERY member of staff dedicated to enhancing the experience of staying in such luxurious hotel. The first thing we did after checking in was shop, escorted by Jim the head concierge which gave us the feeling we were in safe hands.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone as I’ve never been somewhere so customer orientated but hope to get the chance again soon. The bar and mixologist, Daniel, and his cocktails were an experience in themselves and not to be missed.  The food was…"
January 2008,"Problems solved, great stay!","We stayed at the Milestone hotel in London with our two sons, aged 5 and 8, after a previous fantastic stay we had as a couple about a month ago. We booked two connecting rooms, but were faced with some serious problems upon arrival. The rooms were on the fifth floor, that was recently refurbished, but evidently this process was not quite finished. There were no locks on the outer door, the rooms were really extremely small, the DVD-player was not working. TV-channels were mixed up, the airco was out of order, etc. All staff members were extremely helpfull and kind, but the problems remained. That evening we told the Milestone this was not worth their five star rating and their splending reputation and invited them to come up with a solution the next morning. The solution they…"
February 2008,A fab boutique hotel worth visiting!,"My husband and I recently returned from a two-week jaunt through Europe including London on the front and back ends. The trip included Spain, Switzerland and Sweden and I can tell you, hands down, that the Milestone was the highlight of the trip (and I'm hard to impress).   The butler (Terry) is a scream, but in a proper, British sort of way. Since we were only there for one night at the beginning of our trip, we booked the least expensive room rate. Terry showed us our room, but then showed us a few other rooms that were available for an upgrade. While we loved this little tour, we decided not to upgrade as it was already late and we were getting up early to catch our flight. Our room was small and not as smartly decorated as the others we previewed, but the bathroom was large…"
January 2008,"Lovely Hotel, Lovelier Staff","I celebrated a milestone birthday at the Milestone Hotel and couldn't have been happier with my experience.  From the moment my friend and I checked in till the moment we left, the staff was attentive, courteous and kind. We were upgraded to a large and luxurious room, offered a bottle of champagne (which was brought to the room with extra glasses so we could share it with friends) and advised that a birthday cake had been arranged for me. Following check-in, we were shown around the public rooms and then graciously escorted to our sumptious quarters.  After I booked the stay, I was sent a Guest Preference form to complete. Clearly, someone paid attention, because our quiet, non-smoking room was decorated in a favorite color scheme, had plenty of pillows, lots of hangers and a…"
November 2007,Top notch service with luxourious rooms & fantastic architecture,"The Milestone is one of my favorite hotels in the world.  The staff go out of their way to ensure the guest's comfort (from the friendly butler, to the helpful concierge, to the great maid service which brings you fruit, candies and little appetizers every night).  There are so many little touches that make this property spectacular.  It's in a beautiful building, the rooms are spacious, quiet, & the interior decorating is superb.  We loved the Venetian suite.  Make sure you have their tea & scones, it's the best tea experience in London.  This is not a cookie-cutter generic type hotel - it has a lot of character & old-world elegance.  They are very centrally located, with a great view of Kensington Park.  The resistance pool is also very nice if you like swimming."
December 2007,One of the best hotels in London,"Very nice small hotel; the suite was not so big, but well appointed and comfortable. Just a bit of noise coming from the street."
October 2007,Hotel for the discerning,"I ended up here after the ParkCity could not extend my stay so I was not very happy at having to pay 230 gbp for a nights sleep.  Thats where the downer stops... Brilliant location, my room overlooked Kensington Palace.  Brilliant check in, I arrived early and the Receptionist noticed I had a Blackberry and offered to email me once the room was ready. Brilliant room, stayed in the Safari Suite and was impressed.  Brilliant bar, the waiter knew his stuff and we settled on a nice Bordeaux ! I really have a problem finding problems with this hotel and I am in the trade so usually I am faulting them. Maybe 2 gripes - insufficient foreign language tv channels for the overseas visitors and for a hotel of this standard , no green tea in the room. I consider this hotel to be a gem."
September 2009,Milestone is Great,"Everything was perfect at the Milestone - service, decor, friendliness of staff, quality of furnishings and fixtures.  And the food - the ""Midnight Lovers' Feast"" was marvelous.  Will certainly stay there again."
August 2009,The Aloha Spirit is Alive and Well in London - the Milestone!!,"The aloha spirit is alive and well in London  … at the Milestone.  Being born and raised in Hawaii, I have been around a hospitality industry that is internationally known for its care and grace with visitors my entire life.  As a Vice Chairman of a bank and a financing consultant, I have raised hundreds of millions of dollars for various hotel projects and am intimately aware of how VITAL customer service is in this sector.  I have witnessed how the Milestone has gone beyond simple “satisfaction” to superlative service in virtually every category.   Our room was a wonderful suite, full of warm sunshine in the day and toasty ambiance at night.  Always impeccably clean with freshly cut flowers, every request was IMMEDIATELY attended to and every expectation, exceeded.  Our…"
July 2009,The Milestone oh how we loved you!,"My husband surprised me on our wedding anniversary with a trip to London, he jokingly said he was only able to find us a room in a B&B, this was fine until the taxi pulled up outside The Milestone and then I thought I had died and gone to heaven! From the moment we stepped out of our taxi until the moment we stepped in again upon our departure we were treated with such warmth, attention to detail and kindness, the likes of which it is hard to described. The room we stayed in was wonderful and very comfortable with views over the park, so lovely to be able to sit and people watch and take in the parks historical beauty. Our butler was so friendly and amazed me each time he remembered our names. Nothing was too much trouble, the breakfast was lovely and very elegant. The small…"
August 2009,"I have stayed in 5 star hotels all over the world and this one is something very, very special.","The Milestone accomplishes what many try  and few achieve.  It is gracious but not stuffy or pretentious.  Everything exudes an attention to detail and quality that is rarely seen, and I mean EVERYTHING.  Our room had upholstered walls in a grey wool fabric that was breathtaking.  As if that wasn't enough, the draperies were of the same fabric and the luxuriousness with which they dressed the enormous windows overlooking Kensington High Street and Gardens was extraordinary.  Everything...bed linens and towels, carpets, table linens, china, cutlery...were of the highest quality and presented magnificently.  The room wasn't big but it didn't need to be.  The combination of the ceiling height and step down sitting area made the room just right.  This hotel is a jewel.  For anyone…"
August 2009,Lovely boutique hotel in excellent location,"Found the Milestone Hotel when I booked through American Express Platinum. The price was quite fair for London. The rooms that my family received were furnished with  eclectic pieces, and the room designs were different from each other. The rooms were spotless with maid service twice a day. We had a delicious  breakfast included in the price which could either be delivered via room service or in the dining areas.  This hotel is extremely service orientated with very friendly staff!!  The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the High Street Kensington Station and has a view of the Park. I can highly recommend this property to both leisure and business travelers."
August 2009,"Great hotel, but niggly problems","First of all this is a stunning hotel in a great location for Kensington, Knightsbridge and Notting Hill for retail therapy and relaxing. Very attentive staff who are really friendly. The rooms are a little small - or should I say, there was a lot of furniture crammed in to our room.  However, lack of a functioning TV (it had to be repaired twice in a four day stay), an unstable wireless set-up was a small price to pay for an unbelievable trip to London."
July 2009,wonderful small hotel in perfect location,"Our first time in London...this hotel was recommended by travel agent. Lovely hotel! We stayed a week in an apartment...my recommendation if you have a family. We loved having the extra room and my kids(18 & 11) had their own rooms. 2 bathrooms also which is a HUGE plus! Perfect location without car. Bus stop was right across the street and tube station is a short walk down the street. Staff is top notch!! Ask and you shall receive...and I'm not kidding about that!! If you are an avid runner or walker, you will love Kensington Park right across the street. We had a fantastic time in London!"
August 2009,Wonderful service perfect stay with our four legged friend!,"Cant fault the service we recieved at this hotel,great location,attention to detail,best hotel we have stayed at with or without our Maggie dog.Perfect in every way."
July 2009,Absolutely Fantastic - It's all in the attention to detail.,"My wife and I arranged a one night stay at the Milestone Hotel for our Anniversary.  We arrived late afternoon to what was an emaculate Hotel with the highest level of service I have ever encountered.  The friendly staff were only a phone call away - nothing was too much trouble and we were made to feel like absolute royalty.  We ate in their restaurant that evening before going out to the theatre.  It was quiet, relaxing and the waiter service was extremely professional, polite and very friendly.  The breakfast was beautifully presented and equally tasty - loved the sausages!  The room itself was emmaculate, very spacious and the maid service's attention to every detail reaffirmed the feeling of royalty.  I have never stayed anywhere like the Milestone before I doubt highly…"
May 2006,"Dynamite experience, highly recommend!",We stayed at the Milestone Hotel during a resent trip to Europe. It was an unparallel hotel experience! The Milestone is in a prime location overlooking the park. They thought of everything down to fresh fruit delived to our room daily. We had afternoon tea on our private balcany. If you want to live like a prince this is the place to do it!
August 2007,The best in the world,"I could write a book about how much I enjoyed my stay at The Milestone.  But instead, I'll just say this:  I travel a lot for work, all over the world, and The Milestone is simply the best I have experienced in the world.  The service, the rooms, the location -- unbeatable.  Well worth it!"
August 2007,Setting the standard.,"I have recently returned from my second stay at The Milestone Hotel within the last month. I was initially recommended the hotel by American Express (Centurion Card-Black Card), their restaurant and hotel recommendations are generally very good. The Milestone was recently voted the fourth best hotel in the world by a leading travel magazine and I can unreservadly endorse this accolade.  London has a comprehensive choice of hotels ranging from budget to some of the worlds best........this is one of the worlds best for customer service. The hotel is relatively small with less than sixty bedrooms, it was built in the 19th century as two  townhouses and retains many of its original period features. All of the rooms are totally different but have all been decorated with style and…"
July 2007,"Small, nice, but costly","My wife and I stayed for five nights and found the hotel small and quaint, however in my opinion very much overpriced for what we received.  Good points:  Service was great and the staff does try to take care of you as best as possible.  Clean, nice, and good location.  Not so good points: Dinner and amenities are overpriced...probably due to the size of the hotel.  We had dinner the first night and my steak came out very rare...they did not prepare a new steak but simply reheated the raw steak.  Not what I expect when paying for an expensive meal...$1,000 U.S. for two.    I asked them to fix the air conditioner because it made a very loud screeching noise that would wake us up at night.  This was not fixed so we got used to waking up 2 - 3 times a night.  Overall, we have…"
May 2007,english townhouse,"the milestone was exactly what I imagined after months of searching then deciding... we arrived at gatwick and taken to hotel by our airport transfer - very efficient and great driver. the reception staff checked us into our 3 rooms - the safari, the princess and a twin bedded room all on the fifth floor facing hyde park...beautiful.  the concierge were outstanding throughout our stay e.g. the tour de france w/e caused traffic havoc in London and when they realised that  to get a taxi for our dinner booking would be virtually impossible , they ordered a limousine - gratis !!! all our rooms were beautiful, kept clean and turn down was faultless...the toileteries were penhaligon !! Breakfast  was included and the food was delicious but the staff were a bit up and down. Be sure to…"
June 2007,Fantastic Staff make this Hotel,"I have been very slack with my reviews of our last holiday. We stayed in this hotel in May for 4 nights. The Milestone is in a fantastic location with Hyde Park opposite. Great for kids to run around and burn off energy. There are heaps of reasonably priced restaurants around and shops to buy beer, wine and snacks. The underground is a short walk and you are central to get to all areas of London easily. I was a bit disappointed in the room we had. The carpet was stained and the paint was chipped. It just had that run down feel. They also don’t have proper king size beds, only two singles pushed (or zipped?) together. We were limited in the room we had as we had to have an extra bed for our 12 year old son. Many of the rooms are quite small – but that is London. I was also…"
May 2007,Loved the Hotel and Staff,"My husband and I stayed 4 nights post cruise and were delighted with the hotel and staff. They upgraded us to a park view room. Terry the host was wonderful. The room was a bit small by American standards, but beautiful, clean and comfortable. Large bathroom with tub and shower.  Full breakfast was included and delicious. The doorman was charming, actually there was more than one, sorry I didn't get his name. The tube is a short walk up Kensington High St, lot's of resturants in the area, plus the park where we walked everyday. We had glorious weather. Would defintely stay again. "
May 2007,"Posh, lovely","Top-notch service, nicely appointed rooms.  We were upgraded to a junior suite from a king.  It was still not a large room (European sizes, not American sizes), but really nicely decorated with a wonderful bathroom.  We stayed for one night only, which is a shame.  The hotel area is at the end of Kensington Park, on a busy street but street noises were not evident to us.  Lots of shopping in the area, as well as the park for walking, but as others have pointed out it's not necessarily at the center of town.  Very nice breakfast (the hotel's Web site had specials that include breakfast).  Overall, deserving of its ""leading hotels"" insignia. "
April 2007,Nice little hotel in the heart of London,"This is a nice little botique hotel in the hear of london.  Great staff, nice rooms (though a bit small).  Location is South Kensington - which is a drawback if you want to spend most of your time around Knightsbridge.  Overall a pleasant place to stay with excellant staff. "
August 2006,Superb  Hotel,"From  the   moment  we  checked  in   at  this  lovely  hotel  we  knew  we  were  at  a special  place  .  The   staff  were  so   helpful  they   coudnt   do  enough  for  you ,whilst  they  were  checking our  room  was   ready  they  gave  us  tea  and  coffee  in  the  lounge .  The  room  was    spacious  and  spotless , turndown service  was  excellent .  Breakfast the  following  day  was  lovely   excellent  choices.  I have  nothing   but  praise  for  this  hotel  , will   be  returning  again . "
April 2007,The apartments are an exquisite secret,"My husband and I and our two daughters recently stayed at the Milestone for 2 weeks while in London.  We were booked into one of the apartments that are in a townhouse attached to the hotel.  Guests in the townhouse may enter either through the hotel's main entrance or through an electronically controlled door to the townhouse.  The apartment was exquisite!  There were two full bedrooms (each with a queen-sized bed) and sleeping loft upstairs with a pull out couch.  For an extended stay it was ideal.  There was a fully outfitted high end ktichen (which we used only for breakfast), two full bathrooms, an eating area and a living area with TV etc. (plus televisions in each of the sleeping areas.  The real plus though was a washer and dryer in the unit - an absolute necessity for…"
February 2007,Every little detail thought about,"This is a real Gem near the centre of London.  Old style service quality with some very up-to-date touches in the room.  All the staff are very professional without being snooty, they seem to genuinely want you to have a great stay.  The room was not large, but was wonderfully decorated with careful touches such as the i-pod speakers, wi-fi, controllable aircon and DVD players.  The bathroom was high quality with plenty of space for all your own stuff backed up by high-end supplies from the hotel.  The warm welcome, ease of check-in, great porterage and complimentary glass of champage at check-in, was matched by the efficient checkout with the offer of a bottle of water for my journey. "
February 2007,Charming,"The Milestone Hotel is perfect in every way.  The staff are top notch; personable, professional and pleasant. Our room had a lovely view, was cozy and beautifully decorated and had a pristine bath. Turndown service in the evening was extra special with the addition of votive candles in the bath. Bed linens and pillows were luxurious and we were even asked to choose what pillows and duvet we preferred.  We were always called by name by everyone on staff.  It was clear that whatever we might request would be done for us happily.  The lounge, lobby, restaurant and all common areas were beautiful.  It was like being a guest in a private home.  Afternoon tea was wonderful and a must if you have never had high tea in London. Dinner in the restaurant was gourmet and the service was…"
January 2007,Personalized attention,"The service in this hotel is excellent!  The rooms are exquisitely appointed, with modern baths, free internet connections, wonderful turn down service.  We went for my birthday, and my son had requested the Food and Beverage Director make a birthday cake for me ( a surprise for me).  It was a sinfully rich and moist cake and the presentation was excellent.  Our experience with this hotel and with this neighborhood in London couldn't have been better.  We highly recommend it. "
November 2006,What a gem!,"My husband and I recently took a trip to Morocco, London, and Dubai. Out of all the hotels that we stayed at I would have to say that The Milestone was the most charming hotel. The hotel is very small, which means you get personal, warm service from every staff member. From the point that we arrived we were checked in quickly and then given a tour of the hotel and of our room by a wonderful butler named Terry. Terry, throughout our entire stay, was a tremendous help in suggesting what things to see, where to eat, etc. He is a great addition to this hotel.  After we were shown our room and all the ""extras"" it had we were given a complimentary drink (we recommend the hot chocolate because it's given with delicious cookies) and we had time to walk the nearby shops and get something…"
September 2006,Would stay here again in a heart beat!,"This is my favorite hotel in London. It's small but exquisitely decorated, and the service is just wonderful. No request is too big or too small, and when I have had (very minor) issues, they have responded quickly, efficiently and satisfactorily.  I also ate the the hotel restaurant and it was a very satisfactory meal. Room service too was wonderful.  If you can, stay in the apartments as these are just so beautifully furnished with real fireplaces, shiny beautiful kitchens, and lovely rooms.   I love this hotel.  In terms of location, this is the type of hotel for people who want to experience ""London life."" It's not very near the theater & museum district (but it's just one bus ride away), but you're right in front of Kensington Park & Palace, and your neighborhood is the…"
August 2006,Like Staying in a Wonderful Private Home,"If you are looking for a wonderful small hotel with a very British feel then the Milestone is for you!  We had a wonderful stay there.  The staff is so friendly and helpful.  After a full day of site seeing it felt like coming home.....if only my home was decorated so lovely!  The rooms are cheerful and comfortable though a little on the small size compared to American standards.  The location is great, right across the street from Kensington Palace, quiet yet not too far from the action.  The tube station is a short walk and the on and off bus lets you off almost at the hotel door.  There are several good places to eat close by.  We had an excellent meal at the Indian restaurant down the block and the Italian restaurant makes the best pizza...even better than the ones we had in…"
August 2006,The Milestone - A well-kept secret,"We wanted to be near a friend's flat in Kensington and she recommended the Milestone Hotel as an excellent choice of hotel.  We're glad we took her advice - it is a real gem!  The decor is unfussy English and the staff couldn't be any nicer.  Our room was a little small but immaculate and we loved the rain shower head in the bath.  We had an excellent dinner our first night and the breakfast buffet was more than adequate with choices of hot dishes available.  We would definitely stay there again.  Travelers from Amelia Island, FL "
July 2006,Wonderful hotel!,"We had a wonderful stay at the Milestone Hotel from Aug 23 - 26, 2006. The management staff would greet us by name and stop and chat with us  during breakfast or while we were relaxing in the lounge with afternoon drinks. The concierge helped us with tourist venue reservations and also with wonderful dinner reservations at neighborhood restaurants and also at the hotel restaurant. He also helped by email prior to our travels. The head butler is a charming man who is extremely proud of the hotel and is a very good hospitality ambassador! He took us on a tour of the hotel which we enjoyed.  Our room was very quiet and off the main street and tastefully decorated in a French toile motif. We had 2 large chairs to read the daily paper that was delivered to us and to relax in also,…"
July 2006,Milestone exceeds our expectations in every way!,"We had a fantastic stay at the Milestone, and would recommend the hotel to anyone. It is a very charming small hotel, well located within a few minute walk to the High Street - Kensington tube station, where you have access to all of London on their wonderfully convenient Subway system. There is also plenty of shopping, and pubs for dining and nightlife within easy walking distance. Rooms are on the smaller side (which can be expected for London), so I recommend reserving one category higher than you would usually be comfortable in. However they are appointed with every possible modern luxury and convenience, you will not be disappointed. They are richly decorated, with wall hangings, comfortable furniture and beds. But the best part of staying at the Milestone is the service.…"
June 2006,So comfortable!,"15th July, 2006  This is the third visit to this hotel in Kensington which we have found to have excellent service, lovely staff and beautiful rooms. Right in front of Kensington Gardens, you have plenty of shops, pubs and restaurants in walking distance but are only 10 mins away from the West End. Every room I have seen (total of 5) are all differently but individually decorated and include all the essentials even down to stationery items in the desk. We have stayed in many hotels in London (including Claridges and Blakes) but this is our favourite. "
June 2005,Charming Hotel with Great Service,"Our family enjoyed this hotel and its wonderful ambience.  Although one of our original rooms was too small and inconsistent with the description,  the front desk worked with us to move us to a larger room for a supplemental charge. Terry, the butler, was especially charming.  Full English breakfasts were very good, and dinner was excellent.  The concierge was extremely accomodating.  We appreciated the free internet access.  Sometimes the doorman has to work hard to hail a taxi so allow plenty of time before the theatre or dinner out. "
July 2005,"Terrific service, excellent location",We stayed at the Milestone for two days prior to taking a cruise from Southampton. From the moment we arrived the personal attention was outstanding. The room as one would expect from an older hotel were on the small size when compared to what Americans are used to. But the room was wonderfully appointed and the bathroom was actually quite large. There are lots of nice little touches as well.  The lobby and public areas were charming. The breakfast was very over priced and quite ordinary. The lounge was a terrfic spot to relax after a busy day. The location is close to the Tube (Circle and District Lines) and the neighborhood is very nice and upscale. The Palace gardens are a great place for an early morning run.  All and all I highly recommend the Milestone for any one who…
January 2005,One of my favorites in London,"I travel to London on business almost every month and the Milestone is ""my"" hotel.  There are three main reasons why I stay at the Milestone:  great staff and personalized service; unique, comfortable rooms; and proximity to Kensington Park (just across the street).  They've got a cozy bar with a friendly bartender and the food is good as well (although expensive).  Compared to the large, impersonal hotel across the street with small, kennel-like rooms that are mostly alike, the Milestone is a real gem.  Is it perfect?  No.  The Milestone doesn't tolerate wild swings in temperature very well.  The heating and A/C system doesn't handle high highs and low lows (I've had to request a space heater and a fan during stays there) but I'm willing to put up with that for all of the other…"
January 2005,"Perhaps suitable for Mr. Average, but disappointing for selective guests","As a connoisseur of 5 star hotels worldwide, and a marketing specialist, I know quality. In my opinion, attention to detail is what makes a hotel memorable or forgettable.. There were several disappointments at this hotel, however the staff are absolutely superb, and were very accommodating.  Whilst the suite itself was sumptuously decorated, (Prince Albert Suite) and very suitable, there were problems one after another.  I had called ahead an hour before to let the concierge know my flight had changed and I would be arriving earlier, to please re-arrange the chauffeur and suite. When I arrived, tired and cold from a very shoddy flight, I was asked to wait, as the room was not ready. I was gracious, not wanting to be a bother, however I was still waiting an hour and a half…"
June 2004,Wow!  What a Fantastic Hotel to Stay in,"I had been hoping to stay at the Red Carnation's 5* Milestone hotel since discovering the Red Carnation chain some 18 months ago.  I have to say that it was well worth the wait.  From the Door Men to the waitress serving breakfast, the service is sublime, couldn't be faulted and nothing was too much trouble.  The room - wow what a view we had of Kensington Palace Gardens, the view was worth the supplement.  Even overlooking a busy road, there was hardly any noise from the outside traffic.  The room was decorated in keeping with other RCH hotels, rich use of curtains and fabrics, antiques and lovely pictures, all gave the room a sense of style.  The Air con was working fine, although a little bit noisy, but we didn't need to keep it on overnight.  I found the bathroom a little…"
May 2004,Perfect!!,We stayed in the Milestone apartments; which are a part of the hotel.  The rooms were beautifully finished and appointed.  The hotel is in a wonderful part of London.  The service at the hotel is fantastic with Peter Davies and his wonderful staff of concierges willing to help with anything. 
April 2003,Loved The Milestone Hotel,"I have just returned from London where I happily stayed at The Milestone Hotel. This deluxe establishment has an extraordinary location across from Kensington Palace. It is a classic and handsome Victorian red brick building. The Milestone is a small, elegant, luxurious hotel with a top notch staff and a fine restaurant and bar. The cooking is the very best. The rooms are filled with handsome details and done in top residential quality. The Milestone offers peace and quiet, great personal service and attention to details rarely seen today. I would highly recommend it to the discerning traveler.  Warmly, William Tomicki "
June 2006,Simply Charming,"My wife and I went to London for a long weekend and stayed at the Milestone.  We like the group (LSHW) and the tripadvisor reviews convinced us.  We weren't disappointed at all - except perhaps with the bill!  Wow!  Still, the rooms are wonderfully appointed, the bathrooms are simply awesome (candles, ivy) and the breakfast is very good (though the coffee could be stronger and/or refills more frequent).  Helpful, friendly staff were very eager to please, but respected our privacy.  All in all, a very nice little hotel with a cozy atmosphere and a very good location.   "
June 2006,Outstanding Experience,"After much research in the pricey London hotel market, I settled on the Milestone and stayed there for 5 nights in June to attend the Chelsea Flower Show and visit London with my mother.  Having stayed at many of the best hotel around the world, I can honestly stay that this met and in some respect expected my very high expectations.  From the service, to the location (across Kensington and close to the tube), to the amenities, and the general ambiance of a small boutique hotel.  It is a bit pricey but clearly attention to details is there at all times.  Service at the breakfast small room was not on par but the food was fine.  If you like small hotels, great service, value small details and enjoy being pampered this is it - I stayed at the Montague for a night on my way back…"
June 2006,"Small, but fantastic","Just left the Milestone, stayed there for one night.  Fell in love with the place the moment we walked into the hotel.  The rooms are small, but last time I checked this was London?  We had a great room overlooking Kensington Gardens, (507) with excellent view of the palace.  The service was not noticeable, (which is good) but alway there when you needed it.  Ate at the resauraunt, $$$!!!  but the food was fantastic, the sevice was great, and was a perfect end to our vacation.  This was a fantastic oasis in a hectic city of london.  I cannot wait until we go back to london, and without a doubt back to the Milestone!!! "
May 2005,"Great location, helpful staff","We spent 3 nights at this superbly located hotel. We booked through Expedia for 1,000US$. The room, though small, was very elegantly decorated  and the staff was always keen to help and give suggestions. Ther hotel is walking distance form High Street Kensington tube station and opposite Hyde park which was great for jogging in the morning.    "
November 2005,Best in London,"This is a wonderful place to stay for a peaceful and luxurious retreat from the city bustle. My husband and I stayed at this marvelous hotel in late August 2003 (honeymoon). We were upgraded to a beautiful room (310) overlooking Kensington Gardens and were thrilled to find flower and chilled champagne awaiting us. The service was consistenly perfect: staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Bathrooms with beautiful caramel marble and Penhaligons toiletries! This hotel is small enough to feel cozy, but it is definitely a luxury hotel in every sense (Leading Hotels of the Wordl and Five Star Dimandon Award). "
February 2006,"Fabulous service, quaint: I give the Milestone 4.5 stars.","This hotel was one of our favorites out several others claiming to be 5 star on our London/Paris trip.  Not chic, but charming & romantic with zero pretention.  The room was smaller than we expected (and we expected small), but then everything was tiny: the hallways, the elevator, just everything.  But still worth it, because it had a lot of charm - cute little awning over the bed, turndown service complete with a nougat on each pillow and a little ""surprise"" each night - a booklight on the first.  Continental breakfast includes above-average items: smoked salmon, ham (i think?), fruit salad, tropical fruit, fabulous yogurt, as well as the usual selection of breads, cereal, etc.  Hot toast comes on a cute little upright toast server.  It was truly the service that knocked us…"
September 2005,Superb Service,"My husband brought me here for the night for my recent birthday. From the moment we checked in to the moment we left the service was superb. I can be fussy about hotels, noticing small things that I would comment upon, but I had no negative comments to make at all about this one. Teh service was very friendly and personal without being OTT. Our room had a fabulous view over Kensington Gardens, the amenities in the room were way above average for a 5 star hotel. Turndown service was little books on the pillow (to take home) hot water bottles in the bed. Dinner in the restaurant was delicious, and the staff wished me happy birthday at every opportunity. I even received a card from them on the day of my actual birthday. I would definitlely stay here again, or try one of their other…"
August 2005,We Loved the Milestone...,"What a wonderful experience! My husband and I have just returned from spending 5 days at the Milestone and were very pleased. Attention is paid to every possible detail, the staff were friendly, helpful and always very courteous. If you are looking for luxurious surroundings in a wonderful neighbourhood (accross from Kensington Palace) and don't mind spending a little extra, this is the ultimate place! Wonderful little extras such as their ""turn down"" service which includes hot water bottles in your bed, slippers, bathrobe and candle in the bathroon. Afternoon tea is delightful, soft piano music in the lounge at night, and excellent food available throughout the day and night.  Lots of restaurants and shopping nearby. Truly a great ""London"" experience!!"
December 2004,Service makes it special,"Having stayed in more than ten of London best hotels, the service at the Milestone makes it my choice. From the moment you arrive until you leave the amazing attention to detail of the staff will surprise you.  Complimentary welcome drink, very noce rooms with big beds and bathrooms, great toileteries, complimentary dinner and a rate of under 200 GBP create by far the best value in London and maybe anywhere.  Dinner in their restaurant was fantastic, a cute lounge with a fireplace and live music. I have stayed in the Four Seasons and all the other big names for twice the cost but think after more than 10 years I have finally found the hotel I will stick with."
November 2023,London Special Offers,"I recently stayed at the Milestone and experienced on of my best ever stays at a hotel, From the Moment we walked in we were welcomed by the doorman, check in was as quick as possible and we were treated like royalty. The rates at the moment were fantastic, The company recently launched a website offering special rates for their London Hotels"
July 2023,My favorite hotel in London,"This is simply the best hotel in London. I have stayed at many others, including the Connaught, and they do not compare. The service is perfect, the staff friendly and hospitable, and the bar is one of the best. They broght over the staff from the bar at the Halcyon, and it never misses. Walter the bartender is the best! Great small hotel, good breakfast, great box lunch to beat airplane food for the trip home.The personal touches are wonderful, winter includes a hot water bottle in a silk cover and candles in your room at night for turndown, along with a reading light and a nougat. Carolyn King can be proud of her staff, they do a wonderful job. Nice small health club in basement and it is across the street from Kennsington Gardens for runners. There are not many hotels that…"
November 2023,Great Experience--Top Notch,The Milestone is a fabulous place. The staff were more than courteous.  One afternoon while staying there the doorman caught up with me on my  way out to hand me an umbrella because he was concerned it would rain.     The room was wonderful with a welcome bottle of chapagne and sweets.  The bed was comfortable and the turn down service was great.     While staying at thr hotel I was able to visit the restauraunt which was excellent--The Pumpkin soup is to die for.     I would definately stay again
October 2023,A Fabulous Hotel,"The Milestone not only lives up to it's five star rating, but in our opinion exceeded that!  The staff was warm, cordial, and exceedingly helpful.  The staff treated us like family.  The restaurant was elegant and the food was exceptional.  Our room had many amenities, was fastidious, and nicely decorated.  This is a hotel we would definitely visit again."
October 2023,Excellent Personal Service,I can't say enough about the personal service. The concierge Peter Davies is fabulous. The hotel bar is small and that's just the way we liked it. The bartenders were professionals. You can't beat the location if you want to stay in the Kensington area. Our room had all of the amenities and was nicely decorated. We are definitely returning to the Milestone Hotel in London.
November 2023,Wonderful place to stay!,"My husband and I stayed at the Milestone in June while we were en route to Dover for a cruise to the Baltic.  We had stayed at the Milestone a few times before and always loved it.  We booked a de luxe room with king bed.  The night before we left home for London I had a message on my machine to ring the front desk at the Milestone.  I was worried that something had gone wrong with our reservation!  I talked to the Duty Manager who told me that our room's AC was not working (and London is hot this summer!) so he asked if we would mind down grading to a room with efficient AC.  He added that this would be for one night only, and then, as compensation we would be moved to a suite.  Well, what could I say!  In fact the room we were put in for the first night was lovely, if a little…"
November 2023,Love this hotel and can't wait to return!,This is one of the best small hotels we have ever stayed at anywhere.  We stayed with our teenagers in one of the 2 bedroom apartments.  It had a kitchen and a washer and dryer.  It was beautiful!  The staff is outstanding and the concierges could not have been more helpful.  This hotel was a joy to come back to every afternoon after long hot days of sightseeing.  We have so much more to explore in London and we will look forward to staying here again. 
October 2023,We LOVED the Milestone!!!,"I recently stayed at the Milestone Hotel in London, having won an auction for the stay on luxury link.   The trip was a weekend ""girl's weekend"" on the eve of my brother-in-law's wedding; the three hotel guests were me, my mother-in-law and the bride-to-be.  I wanted this to be a special weekend, so I looked for a nice package on luxurylink.(--) that included extra treats like high tea and a full breakfast, as both of which can be very pricey in london.  The package was for 2 people, but I called ahead and was told it would be okay to have a third person, but there would be a 30 pound fee for an extra bed, and I would have to pay for the third breakfast and tea separately.   Upon arrival, however,  they indicated that they had, instead of adding an additional bed, decided to…"
October 2023,Loved the Milestone,"We stayed for five nights to celebrate silver anniversary and birthday. We had booked through the Leading Hotels of the World website way in advance and got a decent rate that included the continental breakfast. The reception and concierge were very helpful and friendly. When they showed us the bus stop they actually went outside the hotel to point me in the right direction. They hung up the phone when I approached to ask a question. The room was very lovely, with a canopy bed, small table with 2 chairs and a desk. It had a good size closet. The bedroom was a few steps up from the entrance and the bathroom was level with the entrance. The bath was old fashioned and lovely. Every night they lit a candle in a water-filled bowl by the bath tub, and there was a different treat every…"
November 2023,Excellent,We stayed at the Milestone last year and have already rebooked our next visit for May this year. We had an excellent stay the service was second to none and the rooms were lovely. Recomend this hotel to anyone who wants fantastic accomodation. 
November 2023,Great birthday,My husband arranged for me to spend my 50th birthday at the Milestone.It was fantastic.The staff couldn't do enough for us and made my stay there very special.Ideally situated for a good shopping spree and our room overlooked Kensington Palace. On my birthday the staff arranged a beautiful fresh cream birthday cake (and they let me take most of it home) and a bottle of champagne. I cannot state how great my stay was and it's true you get what you pay for.Worth every penny 
July 2023,worth a stay,"Went to the Milestone for our tenth anniversary this October. It is actually a beautiful and charming inn. We had a lovely room with a good view of the Kensington Palace grounds. It has a real Dickens/old english feel which we were after.  The hotel is kept in excellent condition. Everything worked. The street noise was not bothersome. The room was quiet and sumptous. Staff were also generally friendly.   The concierge went out of his way to book restaurants and a show for our stay. In fact the concierge service is the best I have ever encountered and we do travel widely.  On the minus side the hotel is small, in just about every way. The restaurant while fine at breakfast would be a little cramped at dinner. I do not recommend the bar for the same reason. In addition it is a…"
November 2023,Made a Very Special Day Sublime,"September 3 2005 and the most fabulous day of my life - my wedding day.  We had to change our plans at short notice and decided to get married in London with just a few guests.  The Milestone had been recommended and I was delighted to find out that it was available.  We visited the hotel quietly to check out the decor, food and the service and found all 3 to be faultless.    We arranged a meeting with the functions manager, Stefan, who could not possibly have been more helpful and we were able to hand almost everything over to him to arrange.  Babysitters for the guests' children, hairdressers, early check in, 3 choices of food for each course, flowers,decor etc etc; it was all handled by Stefan with the greatest aplomb.  Nothing fazed him and his suggestions proved invaluable…"
October 2023,Unsurpassed service/excellent location,"We had lived in London for six years, in Kensington and were returning to visit friends before we moved to Shanghai as well as celebrating our 30th Anniversary.  A lot of people elect to stay in the expensive hotels on Park Lane in Mayfair but the Milestone is a gem of a hotel, a listed building, both inside and outside, with staff that go out of their way to take care of your every need.  Further, it has character and a limited number of rooms unlike some of those 100+ room hotels.  Breakfast is a bit expensive and if you know your way around, can be found at less than half the price for a short walk.  That being said, you can have formal afternoon tea, single malt's in the bar and the dinner at Cheneston's is quite good.  The latter, for London, is not outrageously expensive. …"
October 2023,We Love the Milestone!,"We stayed at The Milestone from Dec. 23, 2004, through Jan 2, 2005.  I found the service impeccable.  The food was British- we Americans must over-season everything-  but High Tea was fabulous and the bartender from Italy makes GREAT drinks!  We celebrated Christmas in one of their aparments, and they even put a small tree up for us!  Christmas brunch was excellent.  All of the concierge's recommendations were wonderful.  I have recently entered a sweepstakes where the giveaway is a 4 night stay at The Milestone, and I can honestly say the only reason I bothered to enter was to get to go back and visit this lovely hotel! "
November 2023,Simply put.,"Having recently had the absolute pleasure of attending our sons wedding at The Milestone i now know a better venue is not to be found  Staff were both friendly and professional, attentive and took time to befriend us, especially little Arthur who we believe will become a concierge ! The food is exemplary and beyond words If you are looking for a place that’s welcoming, warm and special don’t look elsewhere you have already found the best their is Colin and Wendy Moult"
November 2023,The Milestone is Awesome!,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the lovely Milestone Hotel, July 23rd-26th, 2023. It more than exceeded our expectations! Prior to arriving in London, my husband had been in Liverpool with friends for The Open and I had been in The Lake District with friends. We planned to meet in London for a few days before returning home. My train on July 23rd was cancelled due to flooding on the tracks which led to a very long day of transfers by taxi from one train station to the next. I finally made it to Euston Station on the evening of July 23rd. When I arrived by taxi to The Milestone, I was greeted by the lovely receptionist who told me we had been upgraded to The Hermes Suite - this was music to my ears, especially after the trying day of travel. My husband was waiting for me in our gorgeous suite, along with a lovely bottle of champagne, fruit, and cheese. We immediately ordered room service, which was delicious. After dinner in our room, I indulged with a good long bath in the stunning marble soaking tub!! What started out being a rather stressful day ended with luxury and relaxation - just what I needed! Our remaining days in London and at The Milestone were wonderful. Breakfast each morning was delicious, and the staff were fabulous! Our trip ended with a very early morning transfer to Heathrow provided by the hotel - we were given morning coffee and a box of delicious fresh baked pastries to take in the car! …"
October 2023,Beyond Comparison,"The Milestone Hotel is a beautiful, five star hotel, located in Kensington. The service, dining experiences and all other aspects of hotel hospitality are beyond comparison. The entire staff are superb in all aspects, and they go out of their way to assist guests. After a week at the hotel recently, we felt the staff treated us like friends, and it was difficult to leave! We will certainly return in the future."
October 2023,Amazing Stay and Attentive Staff Like Family,We had an amazing stay here.  The details and attentiveness of the staff were unmatched.  They treated us like family and took wonderful care of us while in London.  The breakfast each morning was terrific and the location perfect.   We will certainly be back! 
November 2023,A one-of-a-kind hotel,"This is one magnificent hotel. From the staff to the food/tea service to the gorgeous accommodations, this is the type of hotel you want to stay in when visiting London.  The entire staff was so lovely and they truly seemed happy in their jobs.  The bar, the dining room, the common areas...a really beautiful hotel.  I felt peace being there.  Do yourself a favor - if you're going to take a trip to London, do it right and stay somewhere you won't regret choosing...the memories I made the week I was there will last a lifetime.  "
November 2023,Step into the Magic! WOW,"My daughters Sweet 16th  Birthday. When we arrived by Taxi we greeted by Steve who addressed us by our family name and took care of all of our bags. Reception were so friendly and lovely immediately wishing my daughter a happy birthday. When we got to our rooms, there was a birthday card, banner, pink and white balloons, birthday cake and cookies. The personal touches were amazing! This is not 5 star service, it is something way beyond. Something very, very special. Our every need was met by charm and immediate action. While in London we got stuck due to protestors and so we walked to the Chesterfield mayfair  (Also a red carnation hotel) to ask for help for a taxi, they sat us down offered us water and called us a taxi to get to the Milestone. So very kind and an example that the Red Carnation group of hotels are the best in the world with impeccable service, phenomenal staff and extreme attention to every tiny detail. This is is not a stay at a hotel… it’s an experience, a memory and a celebration. Treat yourselves for a magical time. Your won’t regret it!…"
July 2023,"Our favourite hotel in London, will be back soon.","Excellent service throughout the hotel, only ate breakfast at the hotel but that was outstanding, as were cocktails in the bar. Very clean hotel with a great history and spacious rooms. It was our daughter's 21st and the hotel provided a couple of nice treats as a surprise. Location is also perfect to get around London."
November 2023,Exceptional,"The Milestone is a cut above. Elegant and luxuriously beautiful, and yet also a heartily relaxing reprieve from the bustle of London. We stayed four nights in the Ruhlmann Suite. Most all of our needs and requests were deftly anticipated; those that weren’t were handled with speed and aplomb immediately on request. We have stayed at nearly 100 five+ star hotels around the world and The Milestone is among the best of our visits. We had an absolutely delightful stay, and when we return to London, we will certainly be back!"
October 2023,A London Gem,"The Milestone is an absolute gem.  Wonderfully located, ""grand"" (in the lower case sense of impressive but comfortable at the same time), and with a great staff.  Everyone from the doormen to the housekeeping staff, to the food and bar servers, to the front desk, made you feel at home, with your home as a London mansion.  We will definitely return, as often as possible!"
October 2023,A True 5 Star Experience ,"I was looking forward to my stay at the Milestone and was not disappointed.  A very warm welcome,  a beautiful room, and a great location is how I would sum up my stay. Breakfast was excellent, as were drinks in the Stables bar . Service was impeccable throughout our stay.  I normally like to try new hotels and restaurants whilst visiting Cities, but I doubt I will be straying too far from the Milestone when visiting London as it really is an excellent choice. "

Prior to arriving in London, my husband had been in Liverpool with friends for The Open and I had been in The Lake District with friends. We planned to meet in London for a few days before returning home. My train on July 23rd was cancelled due to flooding on the tracks which led to a very long day of transfers by taxi from one train station to the next. I finally made it to Euston Station on the evening of July 23rd. When I arrived by taxi to The Milestone, I was greeted by the lovely receptionist who told me we had been upgraded to The Hermes Suite - this was music to my ears, especially after the trying day of travel. My husband was waiting for me in our gorgeous suite, along with a lovely bottle of champagne, fruit, and cheese. We immediately ordered room service, which was delicious. After dinner in our room, I indulged with a good long bath in the stunning marble soaking tub!! What started out being a rather stressful day ended with luxury and relaxation - just what I needed! Our remaining days in London and at The Milestone were wonderful. Breakfast each morning was delicious, and the staff were fabulous! Our trip ended with a very early morning transfer to Heathrow provided by the hotel - we were given morning coffee and a box of delicious fresh baked pastries to take in the car! …"
October 2023,Beyond Comparison,"The Milestone Hotel is a beautiful, five star hotel, located in Kensington. The service, dining experiences and all other aspects of hotel hospitality are beyond comparison. The entire staff are superb in all aspects, and they go out of their way to assist guests. After a week at the hotel recently, we felt the staff treated us like friends, and it was difficult to leave! We will certainly return in the future."
October 2023,Amazing Stay and Attentive Staff Like Family,We had an amazing stay here.  The details and attentiveness of the staff were unmatched.  They treated us like family and took wonderful care of us while in London.  The breakfast each morning was terrific and the location perfect.   We will certainly be back! 
November 2023,A one-of-a-kind hotel,"This is one magnificent hotel. From the staff to the food/tea service to the gorgeous accommodations, this is the type of hotel you want to stay in when visiting London.  The entire staff was so lovely and they truly seemed happy in their jobs.  The bar, the dining room, the common areas...a really beautiful hotel.  I felt peace being there.  Do yourself a favor - if you're going to take a trip to London, do it right and stay somewhere you won't regret choosing...the memories I made the week I was there will last a lifetime.  "
November 2023,Step into the Magic! WOW,"My daughters Sweet 16th  Birthday. When we arrived by Taxi we greeted by Steve who addressed us by our family name and took care of all of our bags. Reception were so friendly and lovely immediately wishing my daughter a happy birthday. When we got to our rooms, there was a birthday card, banner, pink and white balloons, birthday cake and cookies. The personal touches were amazing! This is not 5 star service, it is something way beyond. Something very, very special. Our every need was met by charm and immediate action. While in London we got stuck due to protestors and so we walked to the Chesterfield mayfair  (Also a red carnation hotel) to ask for help for a taxi, they sat us down offered us water and called us a taxi to get to the Milestone. So very kind and an example that the Red Carnation group of hotels are the best in the world with impeccable service, phenomenal staff and extreme attention to every tiny detail. This is is not a stay at a hotel… it’s an experience, a memory and a celebration. Treat yourselves for a magical time. Your won’t regret it!…"

We have stayed at nearly 100 five+ star hotels around the world and The Milestone is among the best of our visits. We had an absolutely delightful stay, and when we return to London, we will certainly be back!"
October 2023,A London Gem,"The Milestone is an absolute gem.  Wonderfully located, ""grand"" (in the lower case sense of impressive but comfortable at the same time), and with a great staff.

So very kind and an example that the Red Carnation group of hotels are the best in the world with impeccable service, phenomenal staff and extreme attention to every tiny detail. This is is not a stay at a hotel… it’s an experience, a memory and a celebration. Treat yourselves for a magical time. Your won’t regret it!…"
July 2023,"Our favourite hotel in London, will be back soon.","Excellent service throughout the hotel, only ate breakfast at the hotel but that was outstanding, as were cocktails in the bar. Very clean hotel with a great history and spacious rooms. It was our daughter's 21st and the hotel provided a couple of nice treats as a surprise. Location is also perfect to get around London."
November 2023,Exceptional,"The Milestone is a cut above. Elegant and luxuriously beautiful, and yet also a heartily relaxing reprieve from the bustle of London. We stayed four nights in the Ruhlmann Suite. Most all of our needs and requests were deftly anticipated; those that weren’t were handled with speed and aplomb immediately on request. We have stayed at nearly 100 five+ star hotels around the world and The Milestone is among the best of our visits. We had an absolutely delightful stay, and when we return to London, we will certainly be back!"
October 2023,A London Gem,"The Milestone is an absolute gem.  Wonderfully located, ""grand"" (in the lower case sense of impressive but comfortable at the same time), and with a great staff.  Everyone from the doormen to the housekeeping staff, to the food and bar servers, to the front desk, made you feel at home, with your home as a London mansion.  We will definitely return, as often as possible!"
October 2023,A True 5 Star Experience ,"I was looking forward to my stay at the Milestone and was not disappointed.  A very warm welcome,  a beautiful room, and a great location is how I would sum up my stay. Breakfast was excellent, as were drinks in the Stables bar . Service was impeccable throughout our stay.  I normally like to try new hotels and restaurants whilst visiting Cities, but I doubt I will be straying too far from the Milestone when visiting London as it really is an excellent choice. "
November 2023,Simply put.,"Having recently had the absolute pleasure of attending our sons wedding at The Milestone i now know a better venue is not to be found  Staff were both friendly and professional, attentive and took time to befriend us, especially little Arthur who we believe will become a concierge ! The food is exemplary and beyond words If you are looking for a place that’s welcoming, warm and special don’t look elsewhere you have already found the best their is Colin and Wendy Moult"
November 2023,The Milestone is Awesome!,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the lovely Milestone Hotel, July 23rd-26th, 2023. It more than exceeded our expectations! Prior to arriving in London, my husband had been in Liverpool with friends for The Open and I had been in The Lake District with friends. We planned to meet in London for a few days before returning home. My train on July 23rd was cancelled due to flooding on the tracks which led to a very long day of transfers by taxi from one train station to the next. I finally made it to Euston Station on the evening of July 23rd. When I arrived by taxi to The Milestone, I was greeted by the lovely receptionist who told me we had been upgraded to The Hermes Suite - this was music to my ears, especially after the trying day of travel. My husband was waiting for me in our gorgeous suite, along with a lovely bottle of champagne, fruit, and cheese. We immediately ordered room service, which was delicious. After dinner in our room, I indulged with a good long bath in the stunning marble soaking tub!! What started out being a rather stressful day ended with luxury and relaxation - just what I needed! Our remaining days in London and at The Milestone were wonderful. Breakfast each morning was delicious, and the staff were fabulous! Our trip ended with a very early morning transfer to Heathrow provided by the hotel - we were given morning coffee and a box of delicious fresh baked pastries to take in the car! …"
October 2023,Beyond Comparison,"The Milestone Hotel is a beautiful, five star hotel, located in Kensington. The service, dining experiences and all other aspects of hotel hospitality are beyond comparison. The entire staff are superb in all aspects, and they go out of their way to assist guests. After a week at the hotel recently, we felt the staff treated us like friends, and it was difficult to leave! We will certainly return in the future."
October 2023,Amazing Stay and Attentive Staff Like Family,We had an amazing stay here.  The details and attentiveness of the staff were unmatched.  They treated us like family and took wonderful care of us while in London.  The breakfast each morning was terrific and the location perfect.   We will certainly be back! 
November 2023,A one-of-a-kind hotel,"This is one magnificent hotel. From the staff to the food/tea service to the gorgeous accommodations, this is the type of hotel you want to stay in when visiting London.  The entire staff was so lovely and they truly seemed happy in their jobs.  The bar, the dining room, the common areas...a really beautiful hotel.  I felt peace being there.  Do yourself a favor - if you're going to take a trip to London, do it right and stay somewhere you won't regret choosing...the memories I made the week I was there will last a lifetime.  "

Prior to arriving in London, my husband had been in Liverpool with friends for The Open and I had been in The Lake District with friends. We planned to meet in London for a few days before returning home. My train on July 23rd was cancelled due to flooding on the tracks which led to a very long day of transfers by taxi from one train station to the next. I finally made it to Euston Station on the evening of July 23rd. When I arrived by taxi to The Milestone, I was greeted by the lovely receptionist who told me we had been upgraded to The Hermes Suite - this was music to my ears, especially after the trying day of travel. My husband was waiting for me in our gorgeous suite, along with a lovely bottle of champagne, fruit, and cheese. We immediately ordered room service, which was delicious. After dinner in our room, I indulged with a good long bath in the stunning marble soaking tub!! What started out being a rather stressful day ended with luxury and relaxation - just what I needed! Our remaining days in London and at The Milestone were wonderful. Breakfast each morning was delicious, and the staff were fabulous! Our trip ended with a very early morning transfer to Heathrow provided by the hotel - we were given morning coffee and a box of delicious fresh baked pastries to take in the car! …"
October 2023,Beyond Comparison,"The Milestone Hotel is a beautiful, five star hotel, located in Kensington. The service, dining experiences and all other aspects of hotel hospitality are beyond comparison. The entire staff are superb in all aspects, and they go out of their way to assist guests. After a week at the hotel recently, we felt the staff treated us like friends, and it was difficult to leave! We will certainly return in the future."
October 2023,Amazing Stay and Attentive Staff Like Family,We had an amazing stay here.  The details and attentiveness of the staff were unmatched.  They treated us like family and took wonderful care of us while in London.  The breakfast each morning was terrific and the location perfect.   We will certainly be back! 
November 2023,A one-of-a-kind hotel,"This is one magnificent hotel. From the staff to the food/tea service to the gorgeous accommodations, this is the type of hotel you want to stay in when visiting London.  The entire staff was so lovely and they truly seemed happy in their jobs.  The bar, the dining room, the common areas...a really beautiful hotel.  I felt peace being there.  Do yourself a favor - if you're going to take a trip to London, do it right and stay somewhere you won't regret choosing...the memories I made the week I was there will last a lifetime.  "
November 2023,Step into the Magic! WOW,"My daughters Sweet 16th  Birthday. When we arrived by Taxi we greeted by Steve who addressed us by our family name and took care of all of our bags. Reception were so friendly and lovely immediately wishing my daughter a happy birthday. When we got to our rooms, there was a birthday card, banner, pink and white balloons, birthday cake and cookies. The personal touches were amazing! This is not 5 star service, it is something way beyond. Something very, very special. Our every need was met by charm and immediate action. While in London we got stuck due to protestors and so we walked to the Chesterfield mayfair  (Also a red carnation hotel) to ask for help for a taxi, they sat us down offered us water and called us a taxi to get to the Milestone. So very kind and an example that the Red Carnation group of hotels are the best in the world with impeccable service, phenomenal staff and extreme attention to every tiny detail. This is is not a stay at a hotel… it’s an experience, a memory and a celebration. Treat yourselves for a magical time. Your won’t regret it!…"
July 2023,"Our favourite hotel in London, will be back soon.","Excellent service throughout the hotel, only ate breakfast at the hotel but that was outstanding, as were cocktails in the bar. Very clean hotel with a great history and spacious rooms. It was our daughter's 21st and the hotel provided a couple of nice treats as a surprise. Location is also perfect to get around London."
November 2023,Exceptional,"The Milestone is a cut above. Elegant and luxuriously beautiful, and yet also a heartily relaxing reprieve from the bustle of London. We stayed four nights in the Ruhlmann Suite. Most all of our needs and requests were deftly anticipated; those that weren’t were handled with speed and aplomb immediately on request. We have stayed at nearly 100 five+ star hotels around the world and The Milestone is among the best of our visits. We had an absolutely delightful stay, and when we return to London, we will certainly be back!"
November 2023,A London Gem,"The Milestone is an absolute gem.  Wonderfully located, ""grand"" (in the lower case sense of impressive but comfortable at the same time), and with a great staff.  Everyone from the doormen to the housekeeping staff, to the food and bar servers, to the front desk, made you feel at home, with your home as a London mansion.  We will definitely return, as often as possible!"
July 2023,A True 5 Star Experience ,"I was looking forward to my stay at the Milestone and was not disappointed.  A very warm welcome,  a beautiful room, and a great location is how I would sum up my stay. Breakfast was excellent, as were drinks in the Stables bar . Service was impeccable throughout our stay.  I normally like to try new hotels and restaurants whilst visiting Cities, but I doubt I will be straying too far from the Milestone when visiting London as it really is an excellent choice. "
November 2023,Simply put.,"Having recently had the absolute pleasure of attending our sons wedding at The Milestone i now know a better venue is not to be found  Staff were both friendly and professional, attentive and took time to befriend us, especially little Arthur who we believe will become a concierge !

This is not 5 star service, it is something way beyond. Something very, very special. Our every need was met by charm and immediate action. While in London we got stuck due to protestors and so we walked to the Chesterfield mayfair  (Also a red carnation hotel) to ask for help for a taxi, they sat us down offered us water and called us a taxi to get to the Milestone. So very kind and an example that the Red Carnation group of hotels are the best in the world with impeccable service, phenomenal staff and extreme attention to every tiny detail. This is is not a stay at a hotel… it’s an experience, a memory and a celebration. Treat yourselves for a magical time. Your won’t regret it!…"
,"Our favourite hotel in London, will be back soon.","Excellent service throughout the hotel, only ate breakfast at the hotel but that was outstanding, as were cocktails in the bar. Very clean hotel with a great history and spacious rooms. It was our daughter's 21st and the hotel provided a couple of nice treats as a surprise. Location is also perfect to get around London."
,Exceptional,"The Milestone is a cut above. Elegant and luxuriously beautiful, and yet also a heartily relaxing reprieve from the bustle of London. We stayed four nights in the Ruhlmann Suite. Most all of our needs and requests were deftly anticipated; those that weren’t were handled with speed and aplomb immediately on request. We have stayed at nearly 100 five+ star hotels around the world and The Milestone is among the best of our visits. We had an absolutely delightful stay, and when we return to London, we will certainly be back!"
,A London Gem,"The Milestone is an absolute gem.  Wonderfully located, ""grand"" (in the lower case sense of impressive but comfortable at the same time), and with a great staff.  Everyone from the doormen to the housekeeping staff, to the food and bar servers, to the front desk, made you feel at home, with your home as a London mansion.  We will definitely return, as often as possible!"
,A True 5 Star Experience ,"I was looking forward to my stay at the Milestone and was not disappointed.  A very warm welcome,  a beautiful room, and a great location is how I would sum up my stay. Breakfast was excellent, as were drinks in the Stables bar . Service was impeccable throughout our stay.  I normally like to try new hotels and restaurants whilst visiting Cities, but I doubt I will be straying too far from the Milestone when visiting London as it really is an excellent choice. "
,Simply put.,"Having recently had the absolute pleasure of attending our sons wedding at The Milestone i now know a better venue is not to be found  Staff were both friendly and professional, attentive and took time to befriend us, especially little Arthur who we believe will become a concierge ! The food is exemplary and beyond words If you are looking for a place that’s welcoming, warm and special don’t look elsewhere you have already found the best their is Colin and Wendy Moult"
,The Milestone is Awesome!,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the lovely Milestone Hotel, July 23rd-26th, 2023. It more than exceeded our expectations! Prior to arriving in London, my husband had been in Liverpool with friends for The Open and I had been in The Lake District with friends. We planned to meet in London for a few days before returning home. My train on July 23rd was cancelled due to flooding on the tracks which led to a very long day of transfers by taxi from one train station to the next. I finally made it to Euston Station on the evening of July 23rd. When I arrived by taxi to The Milestone, I was greeted by the lovely receptionist who told me we had been upgraded to The Hermes Suite - this was music to my ears, especially after the trying day of travel. My husband was waiting for me in our gorgeous suite, along with a lovely bottle of champagne, fruit, and cheese. We immediately ordered room service, which was delicious. After dinner in our room, I indulged with a good long bath in the stunning marble soaking tub!! What started out being a rather stressful day ended with luxury and relaxation - just what I needed! Our remaining days in London and at The Milestone were wonderful. Breakfast each morning was delicious, and the staff were fabulous! Our trip ended with a very early morning transfer to Heathrow provided by the hotel - we were given morning coffee and a box of delicious fresh baked pastries to take in the car! …"
,Beyond Comparison,"The Milestone Hotel is a beautiful, five star hotel, located in Kensington. The service, dining experiences and all other aspects of hotel hospitality are beyond comparison. The entire staff are superb in all aspects, and they go out of their way to assist guests. After a week at the hotel recently, we felt the staff treated us like friends, and it was difficult to leave! We will certainly return in the future."
,Amazing Stay and Attentive Staff Like Family,We had an amazing stay here.  The details and attentiveness of the staff were unmatched.  They treated us like family and took wonderful care of us while in London.  The breakfast each morning was terrific and the location perfect.   We will certainly be back! 
,A one-of-a-kind hotel,"This is one magnificent hotel. From the staff to the food/tea service to the gorgeous accommodations, this is the type of hotel you want to stay in when visiting London.  The entire staff was so lovely and they truly seemed happy in their jobs.  The bar, the dining room, the common areas...a really beautiful hotel.  I felt peace being there.  Do yourself a favor - if you're going to take a trip to London, do it right and stay somewhere you won't regret choosing...the memories I made the week I was there will last a lifetime.  "
