October 2023,"Excellent hotel, detail oriented, would recommend ","Excellent hotel.  This hotel was exceptional in customer service and value. My only issue was lumpy mattress that needed to be replaced as well as I was put in a handicap room - not my choice. But they did recognize my birthday with a lovely cake, flowers and balloons. That’s made the stay even better. Hotel room was clean, quiet, and all snacks and beverages were included, and refilled daily. I would highly recommend this hotel and stay here again. "
October 2023,A real gem,"The staff are extremely friendly and attentive.  The room was lovely. We were pleasantly surprised when returning from our night out to be greeted by a chocolate cake and card from the staff congratulating us on our wedding anniversary.

October 2023,One of the best hotels in London,Fantastic hotel in a fantastic location with amazing staff. First time we stayed at this hotel. It was so good we decided to extend for an extra night. Highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay again. 
September 2023,Perfect boutique hotel in Belgravia,"Lovely small, quiet hotel, wonderfully situated between Belgravia and Knightsbridge. Comfortable, immaculately clean room, good shower etc. Pleasant restaurant with excellent breakfasts. But really it's all about the staff. Check-in is effortless. The concierge, Ben, is charming and knowledgeable. Every request is immediately heeded to. Each staff member we met -- right down to the engineer who arrived within minutes to check our air conditioning -- was warm and polite. We'll done, Hari. We'll be back."
October 2022,The ripple effect of contentment,"This is by far one of the best five-star stay experiences I have ever journeyed. A customised guest experience that’s as unique as to its art collection displays and parallel to their staff members’ characters. Catered to us with gourmet Italian brunch to hand written welcome notes and souvenirs.   The impressive experience was made obvious for us to  extend our welcome to host our friend for a drink, to do a must-try their very special curated list of cocktails. The Hari experience has the ripple effect to pass on smiles.  A special thanks to Arianna, Mattia, Sante, Maria and all the F&B staffs."
October 2022,This is the place to stay in London,This is our fourth stay at The Hari. It has been wonderful. Rooms lovely. Service excellent. Front of house engaging and warm. Breakfast ( cooked by Federico  S) just sublime. Just a great place to be to escape the rush of London. Location perfect. Central but quiet.
September 2022,Great vibes and best drinks,"I went to the Hari hotel with my brother and his friends for a few drinks and I was left speechless the very moment I walked in. For starters, the interior design of the hotel is stylish and modern yet creates a very cozy and intimate atmosphere, not to mention the drinks,  absolutely exquisite! To be honest, I'm not very fond of cocktails, or alcohol in general, but the Casa Azul I had was not only aesthetically and visually pleasing, but it was also tasted so amazing that I literally could have got addicted to it in no time!! I'd like to thank the entire bar staff, with their kindness, knowledge and professionalism they made the experience even better"
October 2022,Love The Hari,"My husband and I stayed there during the London marathon and it was our first time and it definitely will not be our last . The service was exceptional.

September 2022,6 stars!,"5!  I had a very pleasant evening at The Hari Hotel and feel compelled to write. The evening began with the  supervisor Giuseppe, meeting me cordially and very warmly.   When I asked some questions, he answered like an old friend, creating in me the feeling that I seeing an old friend again, the feeling that I somehow returned home.  I’ve always loved Italy and the warmth of the Italian people and today Giuseppe reconfirmed this.  We talked about different topics with ease and overall, I had an absolutely great evening.  I wanted to add a few words about the barman, Mikhail Who was very impressive. Like a true professional, he guessed my taste inclinations and offered me a cocktail on gin with currant liqueur, a personal favorite but he seemed to have added a secret ingredient…"

We were welcomed by Diego and Claudio who were incredibly friendly and helpful, and we were offered a nice welcome drink at the bar (amazingly made cocktails, lovely stylish setting). Our room itself was nice and spacious, with a beautiful bathroom which had a big bathtub (my bath in there felt like a spa experience). The brunch the next day was lovely too, and the service was friendly and attentive. The decor in the restaurant is beautiful and elegant too, as it is throughout the hotel to be honest.  Everything was brilliant. Thank you to everyone at the hotel who made my stay so enjoyable!"
May 2022,Amazing stay at a beautiful hotel in the heart of chelsea!,"We stayed at the Hari this past weekend and everything was 10/10 from start to finish.

The lounge and restaurant are amazing as well as the phenomenal service from the front desk team. We felt taken care of and the staff really do care about our stay. Will 100% be returning!!"
May 2022,Amazing service!,"I fell in love with this hotel! Went for a weekend getaway to London with friends and enjoyed the warm service. Location of the hotel is perfect! We were made to feel at home immediately! I usually don't like to spend too much time in a hotel when traveling, but the atmosphere and team were so refreshing and professional, we felt very comfortable. We even decided to have the weekend bottomless brunch which was delicious! What a treat! Special thanks to the excellent service from Alex and Ariana throughout the stay! We will be back!"

May 2022,Look no further for first class,"My wife and I recently spent a week in London staying at The Hari. The words that immediately come to mind are professional, helpful, friendly and personal. Notwithstanding these impressive behaviours by every member of the team, the quality of our room was first class and we were graciously upgraded to a larger room on arrival given our 7 night stay. The location is second to none and London is easily accessible by foot, the underground or taxi. We have no doubt that the experience is a reflection of a positive culture lead by senior concierge Ben Malpass. Exceptional!"
April 2022,Family weekend,"My daughter and I came to The Hari for a pre-exam relaxing weekend. This isn’t our first visit and, again, we were hugely impressed. The staff are amazing, so welcoming and attentive - always looking to see how they can make your stay perfect. The room was gorgeous with a beautiful view over the park and stocked with everything you’d need. Thank you for such a wonderful stay, we’re looking forward to seeing you all again !!"
May 2022,Cannot wait to return,A completely faultless stay. A very friendly and welcoming greeting by members of reception and concierge. The bar had a lovely ambience. Very comfortable and spacious room which was tastefully decorated. Unfortunately we didn’t eat at the hotel but the restaurant looked very inviting and will definitely make a reservation the next time we visit. Hard pushed to find a nicer location in London. The service from all staff was exceptional. 5 stars from us.
April 2022,Hidden gem with incredible service,"My stay at The Hari was just wonderful. I was charmed by the team, they are all extremely attentive to our needs.

June 2023,"I had great experience with The Hari Hotel, at Il Pampero Restaurant London highly recommended","Me and my girlfriend decided to come and eat at Il Pampero at The  Hari Hotel, we got  a very pleasant  welcoming   from Naomi the assistant Manager, we got the best ever most  delicious cocktails from the barman Gigi. Our table was professionally taken cared of by Lionel  the waiter. The food was excellent, everything about their service is handled professionally. Highly recommended i am giving it 5 stars"
June 2023,"Meh. Very good, but on the pricey side for what it is.","Overall, our stay was fine. Our deluxe room was very small but well-appointed. The biggest issue for me was the noise as our room was right behind the elevator and across from the cleaning staff room. That means they were constantly in and out of the room across and it was not until late in the evening that the buzz and talk outside our room was done with.  The room condition was a mixed bag. Upon arrival, the air conditioning wasn't cooling very well and no amount of thermostat changes had an impact on the temps in the room. We asked for engineering to come in and take a look while we were at dinner and upon our return the AC worked better. The shower fixture was loose from the wall (almost like someone slipped at some point in the past and tried to break their fall by hanging…"
June 2023,Great Stay in London ,"We stayed at the Hard in early June 2023 and we had a wonderful time.  The staff was so accommodating and helpful, the room was beautifully clean and comfortable, the restaurant delicious and the concierge so helpful when I realized I lost my phone.  The bar/bartenders and the little outside area off the bar was a delight and we spent late afternoons enjoying the fresh air and a glass of Rose!  The location couldn't be better - it's Knightsbridge and you can get pretty much anywhere quite easily from there.  We walked all over London and back to the Hari all 4 days.  I highly recommend this Hotel and will definitely stay there on my next visit.  Book the Hari, you will NOT be disappointed."
June 2023,Hari is Service ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,A very nice boutique hotel with excellent staff and services. Entire service team went out of their way to offer assistance when needed.

May 2023,Wonderful boutique hotel in great location. ,"Wonderful boutique hotel in an excellent location in London, perfect for walking to other areas and sites. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We ate breakfast in the dining area one day and it was delicious. They readily accommodated early check in after an international flight and were there with coffee when we had to depart at 4:30AM. "
June 2023,An Outstanding Experience ,"As a regular visitor to London I had been recommended The Hari by friends and decided to stay here earlier this week. Firstly the location is outstanding. Situated in the heart of Belgravia this beautiful boutique hotel (only 85 rooms) offers a level of personal service and comfort that larger, chain hotels in a similar price bracket can rarely match. Particular recognition must go to Alex who was fantastic during the check-in process and had been made aware of my current mobility issues in advance. He was attentive, discrete and made an excellent impression throughout my stay. To Naomi, also, who looks after the bar in the restaurant and was highly professional and attentive. Thank you, both. My room was spacious, immaculately presented and afforded great views over the…"
June 2023,Perfect,"They made everything perfect, complementary flowers and a treat for my partners 30th birthday. Great rooms and nice location. Only problem was breakfast end time which the TV menu says is 12 but is actually 11."

This hotel is in an excellent area of London, within walking distance to all of London or a short walk to the Tube so you can access more!    The only improvement I would say is that they could use some better options their restaurant menu as well as having fresh coffee available the lobby for guests would be so helpful!  "
July 2022, A Haven in Landon’s Belgrvavia Neighborhood ,"When we arrived at the Hari Hotel after our 8 hour flight from Atlanta, GA, we were greeted by w by three staff members before we  reached the front desk. Throughout our stay , they were unfailingly courteous and friendly. They even gifted  us with truffles with the  flag on them  on July 4!  Ben, the concierge, even loaned na a phone cord. Thehitel décor was lovely with many interesting works of art everywhere. The  king sized bed in our suite was really comfortable  and I slept like a baby for the 6 nights we stayed there. Located in Belgravia, we were walking distance from many attractions. Altogether, this was truly a five star hotel."
June 2022,Enjoyable long stay at the Hari,"Beautiful Hotel in Belgravia neighborhood of London. A true 5 star hotel, central to many of London’s best museums , restaurants and shopping. Staff is both helpful and friendly. The in house restaurant “Il Pampero”is a delightful Italian restaurant. Rooms are kept impeccably clean and have modern electronics and WiFI. This was our second visit to this hotel and we found it just as delightful as our first visit. Concierge service is very helpful in arranging dining and theater reservations . Most notable were Ben and Diego, both were knowledgeable and easy to chat with. Naomi, in I’ll Pampero, was extremely knowledgeable and helpful with wine and food selection. We truly enjoyed our 10 day holiday."

March 2022,Wonderful stay all thanks to a wonderful staff!,"I stayed at The Hari back in March, the staff and facilities were awesome! All of the staff members were thoughtful and made an effort to ensure my mother and I were well taken care of throughout our stay. All of the food was delicious, I miss the room service breakfast! The hotel was quiet and very well located, within easy walking to distance to Harrod's, Belgrave Square and many other sights. I highly recommend staying here and would stay here again when I make it back to London"
August 2022,A hidden Gem of a restaurant,The three of us were warmly welcomed in a very elegant and atmospheric restaurant. We were taken to our seat in a booth where we could see the sky above us and the staff was so alert and very pleasant. We were served by Vittorio who seemed to have an extensive knowledge of the menu and wine selections and he was simply delightful. The food was delicious! Each dish were beautifully presented and full of exciting flavours. The menu wasn’t overwhelming so we enjoyed being able to pick many dish so we could share.

The attention my daughter received from the staff especially the fabulous Maria and the Guest Services Team was faultless. They made her and our stay out of this world.

The Restaurant Il Pampero was exceptional. The whole stay was perfect and we will definitely be returning. One word FABULOUS"
August 2022,Elite Hotel,"Great experience that solidified my future return to this beautiful city of London! Establishments of this caliber (5 star) tend to have an element of pretension. Not at the Hari! Pure class, genuine smiles and professionalism by everyone you encounter. It is an wonderful experience throughout and the service is truly the heart of the hotel. I look forward to returning in the future!"
July 2022,My favourite hotel in London,Had a fantastic stay again at The Hari. Love the team and atmosphere. Have booked my next stay for Christmas already. Can’t imagine staying anywhere else in London now. They make you feel so special.  See you soon!
June 2022,Wimbledon trip,"The stay for this trip was generally very good. I was impressed by the attention given by the staff of the hotel with one minor exception. The food experience was not what I had hoped for as, despite a very sparse breakfast clientele, it took a great deal of work to get the attention of the staff in the main restaurant to get attended to with service requests and the bill. Despite this I would return to the Hari as it had a character that I enjoyed."
July 2022,"Best place to stay in Belgravia, Knightsbridge, Chelsea, Kensington","Our third visit now. This place has a fantastic location. Friendly and willing staff throughout. Clean rooms and bathrooms. Great bar food, drinks and cocktails. Infinitely better value than the Carlton Towers."
September 2023,The Hari experience,A lovely hotel with an amazing staff.  Such an extraordinary and welcoming service by Angelica & Maria. Highly recommended even only for their restaurant. The slider & the doughnuts are a must! The location of the hotel is convenient just minutes away from Sloan street.
September 2023,"Hotel, Staff, and Location are Perfect!!","2nd time we have stayed here.   Staff is great!  Contacted Ben the concierge in advance, and him and Ivan at the front desk took care of everything else.  They placed us on a high floor in a clean and spacious room.    The location is perfect, close to everything.  Belgrave is a high end no non-sense community.  Very peaceful with lots of parks and restaurants in the vicinity.  "
August 2023,Amazing stay! ,"Absolutely everything was perfect! The bedding is extremely comfortable, the rooms are clean and the design is nice. The service is as expected from a 5-star hotel. The area is also very pleasant, as a woman traveling alone I felt  very safe there. The whole team, and especially Andrew, Matt, Alex and John, took great care!"
September 2023,The Hari is perfection,"Every so often you find a hotel that is literally perfect. My recent stay at The Hari was amazing. The location, amenities, room offerings, expert housekeeping and nightly turndown service, and phenomenal staff made for an exquisite stay.

August 2023,Great experience ,"Highly recommended. Great choice to stay in central London, food was great ,rooms very clean and staff make you feel like home. Alex is great asset to the Hari, anything we need he made sure was there on time. Plenty of shops and restaurants around the area. Definitely gonna go back. Thank you "
September 2023,Exceeding customer’s expectations,"The Hari is definitely in the top of hotels we stayed in worldwide. Not because of the great facilities but because of the unmatched service level. From the check-in to the last minutes we spent in the hotel, service was impeccable. Staff were extremely positive and helpful and always trying to exceed the customer’s expectations. Great example is that we casually mentioned at check-in that we would visit the New Forest after our London visit. When we came back from a long day in London we found a piece of chocolate art in our room (see the photo), which anticipated our next stop. Rooms are comfortable and really  well equipped (we got an upgrade and were offered a free minibar; room also has great beds and tv’s with chromecast) and we had a wonderful a la carte breakfast.…"
August 2023,Holiday,"Terrific multi national staff. Very friendly and accommodating Room was very comfortable and well maintained,  Extra requests were speedily dealt with  We enjoyed the restaurant for breakfast but wish it had been open for meals at other times.  Lovely visit"
August 2023,Great Experience!,"Loved my first visit to The Hari! As someone who used to live in London, I have stayed at many different hotels in the area when I come back to visit. The Hari was fantastic. It is the PERFECT location and would recommend. *Close to the Knightsbridge stop to go to/from Heathrow on the Tube, great location to take the Underground from Sloane Square stop to explore all of London).as well as all over London). Also lots of bus options nearby to get pretty much anywhere in Central London. *I had a nice and spacious room, with very good air conditioning, plenty of drawers and good size closet to hang clothes. The bathroom spacious and clean too. I loved the turn down service nightly. *Staff was great and were super helpful and friendly. *Great bar to relax and have a drink after a…"
August 2023,"Location, Location, Location!","Great hotel, great location - we really enjoyed our stay! The hotel sits on a quiet corner, within walking distance of multiple neighborhoods. It's well connected, well-appointed and was well received!"
August 2023,Best service in the world,"We faced a situation while staying there which we hope no one will ever have to go through it ever . Our young son passed away unexpectedly on the last night . We have never seen such a level of assistance and compassion anywhere else in the world . As a result of his passing we had to extend our stay for few days , the hotel manager informed us that our rooms will be free of charge for the coming 2 nights AND we when we had to extend again they gave us a 50% discount for the remainder of our stay . Big thanks to Andrew the General Manager , Mathew the Deputy GM and everyone else who were absolutely incredible . As difficult as it may be to return to the same hotel next time we are in London , as far as we are concerned there is one and only one hotel in London for our family .…"
April 2023,Super Friendly Hotel,I booked in for one night last minute as my husband was not feeling well in London and i wanted him to relax. On arrival i informed the recption staff and they gave us a nice quite room for him to relax. The front desk where very helpful and very helpfull on everything. This is one of the best hotels for price that i have stayed in and the location is great. The rooms are very comfortable with a nice big bed. There is a great big tv on the wall and a well stocked mini bar.  I will be back as i enjoyed my stay.  
April 2023,Not to Miss,"I was recently on a 3 week work trip through Europe, and ended my stay with one night in London before heading home.  My boss recommended the Hari, and I have to say my only regret was not spending an entire three weeks there.    The whole lobby staff was amazing, knowledgeable, and immediately recognized me when I came back in the evening and the next morning.  I never felt that I had to ask for anything - their anticipation of hospitality is second to none.  Thank you, I look forward to staying with you longer next time!"
April 2023,Another excellent stay at the Hari Hotel.,"We’ve once again had the pleasure of staying at the Hari hotel and the standard of our suite and services was as usual second to no other.  Mr Ben Malpas, head concierge at the Hari, and his assistant concierge Ricardo made our stay flow with such ease and their attention to our needs and requests were, as usual, perfect and faultless. Every member of staff were always on hand to make sure we had everything we needed and always acknowledged us with a beautiful smile and words of kindness. The food was to it’s usual very high standards and was served with speed and a smile. Our evenings spent whiling away the hours in the very comfortable bar area drinking cocktails and picking at the never ending supply of nibbles brought to our table was very relaxing. Whenever we are in London…"
March 2023,Wonderful hotel,"Having just stayed at the Hari hotel for our wedding anniversary , I can honestly say what a lovely hotel, it is like a hidden jewel as from the outside it looks nothing but inside wow what a beautiful boutique hotel, we would like to send our thanks to the reception staff who could not of been more friendly and helpful, they made our stay very special and memorable. The room was comfortable and clean. The door men went out of their way to get taxis for you.  Nothing was too much trouble. The next time we visit London this is where we will stay. "
March 2023,An excellent hotel with excellent service,A wonderful experience from start to finish. The room was amazing right in the centre of London. The service was faultless and included wonderful personal touches to help us celebrate our stay. Would recommend to anyone and would gladly stay again.
March 2023,A GREAT HOTEL FIND IN LONDON,"The hotel staff is very welcoming and professional. My husband and I arrived on an overnight from the US, and we were given our room immediately, a true gift. Every person with whom we interfaced was a pleasure and very accommodating. The value proposition here is excellent. My only disappointment was with the restaurant, likely not owned by the hotel. The breakfast was completely overcooked and non-edible."
June 2022,My favorite hotel in London - and I’m a Londoner!,"I have been staying at The Hari several times a year since it first opened. It is in a superb location, and has stunning contemporary yet sophisticated rooms and communal spaces. But what makes The Hari is the staff, they almost become friends over time, and do everything they can to make you feel welcome, appreciated and looked after. Personalized, warm service, that makes you feel special. This is a hotel where the little touches are done to perfection. I far prefer The Hari to much better known (world renowned) establishments in London."
June 2022,"Adequate hotel in good location, but very overpriced","Adequate, but way overpriced (> £1000/night for an adequate, but tiny, room where the previous guest's hair still clung to the shower door - and breakfast wasn't even included !).   Breakfast is very slow (10 minutes just to get your coffee and then the waitress gets your breakfast order wrong, so you have to wait some more). Unfortunately no buffet."
June 2022,Belgravia hotel,"Wonderful accommodation in a quiet neighborhood. Great, friendly staff.  Convenient to several tube lines and just a couple of blocks to Buckingham Palace. Hard to forget the Cacio  E Pepe in the restaurant, il Pamparo."
May 2022,Going back home ,I’ve stayed here a few times now. It honestly feels like going back home. I love it! Everything is just fantastic and I would not stay anywhere else in London. The staff are exceptional. The most comfortable beds. The cocktails are amazing- the list is endless 
May 2022,A great find ,"This hotel is in a great location, staff were very attentive and helpful, room was great, facilities excellent and incredibly clean.  NCP parking just round the corner with great overnight deals.  We will be back."
May 2022,Outstanding in every way!,"The Hari is exceptional in every way! From the comfort of the room, to the outstanding food at Il Pampero, to the atmosphere at the bar! The very best thing about The Hari is the staff from the General Manager Andrew, Head Concierge Ben & his people and to include each & every member of the service staff! "
May 2022,Love is in the air at The Hari Hotel!,"I booked the Hari Hotel due to its modern feel and excellent central location. The hotel is a short walk away from Hyde Park, Sloane Street, and excellent restaurants such as Marcus at The Berkeley and Petrus by Gordon Ramsey.   This was a particularly important stay as It was my girlfriends 30th birthday and I would be making a surprise proposal in Hyde Park during our stay, which I made the hotel aware of in advance!   The customer service was absolutely impeccable throughout our stay. In particular, Marzia, Guest Relations Manager, really went the extra mile to make our  stay one that we will cherish and look back on ever so fondly. Upon arrival Marzia and the team arranged an early check-in for us, a beautiful room looking over London containing flowers, Champagne, birthday…"
May 2022,The Hari gets a 10/10!,"Such a lovely and cozy boutique hotel . You will fall in love with this property the minute you walk in. Staff are super friendly and the service is impeccable. Claudio at the front desk was really helpful, always smiling and cheerful.   The location is perfect. Walking distance to Harrod’s ,Hyde Park and the shops in Knightsbridge.  Nice rooms , decent size and the bed is extremely comfortable.  Would highly recommend The Hair and would definitely visit again."
May 2022,Best Sleep,"I could mention the great room, the central and safe location, how pleasant everybody was, but something my wife said made me realize what is the most important: we slept like babies during our 3 nights at the Hari. Is it the comfortable bed, the quietness (even though our room was on the street side), or something else? I don't know, and I don't really care. A good night sleep is what hotels are there to provide, and the Hari does that, and more. I highly recommend it."
May 2022,Best place to stay in London,"The location of The Hari Hotel is simply outstanding. Located in the Belgravia neighborhood, it offers easy access to some of London's most popular attractions, including Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park, and the shopping district of Knightsbridge. Additionally, the Knightsbridge Tube station is just a few minutes' walk away, making it easy to get to other parts of the city.  The hotel rooms are simply stunning. Elegantly decorated in a modern and luxurious style, they offer all the comfort one could dream of when staying at a hotel. The beds are comfortable, the bathrooms are spacious and well-equipped, and the views of the city are breathtaking. Additionally, the rooms are equipped with all modern amenities, including air conditioning, free Wi-Fi, a flat-screen TV, and a…"
March 2023,Professional attentiveness at every turn,"My wife and I stayed here for the first time and could not be happier with the hotel and wonderful staff.  Every single staff interaction was friendly, welcoming, professional and attentive.  Diego and Ben at the concierge desk were super helpful and the lovely woman who checked us in at 8 am got us into a room right away.  After a long flight, being welcomed with a coffee or drink from the bar is a nice touch.  Despite some room refurbishing going on, the hotel was quiet, bed extremely comfortable and amenities perfect.  What a pleasure!"
March 2023,wonderful hotel,"Wonderful hotel.  In particular, we thank Alec for the careful and attentive welcome!  We feel special, living up to the 5 stars awarded to the hotel.  Very attentive receptionists, open the door and help to locate the uber.  We have no complaints, only praise."
March 2023,For a romantic weekend,"Had a wonderful time at the Hari for a romantic weekend in match 2023.  The hotel is well situated, with easy access to central london and Theatreland. The rooms are lovely and the staff impeccable.  I highly recommend booking here for your next trip."
March 2023,Amazing brunch!,"We had brunch Sunday and I could not have asked for a better meal! The pizza was delicious, coffee was strong and the pancakes fluffy! The staff were so friendly, special shout out to Sante and Sandra who were just so attentive to detail and very informative about the menu options. Spent a lovely afternoon and definitely recommend :)"
March 2022,So good to be back!,"It’s been a few years since I have stayed here and I’m delighted to say it’s even better than I remembered. We were celebrating this weekend and were made to feel so special by the team. It was also lovely to see some familiar faces from our last visit. We didn’t have time for brunch this weekend, but the musician sounded great so will definitely be booking that on our next visit."
March 2022,Amazing hotel especially Claudio,"Myself and my husband checked in, to be greeted with a welcome drink any of our choice, and a room upgrade. Claudio the new manager checked us in and went over and beyond to make our stay special. The service provided was exceptional from himself and all other staff member. Beds where comfortable, location was amazing and the room was spacious and a nice temperature. Will definitely recommend and will definitely visit again."
March 2022,A wonderful experience.,"Our second visit to The Hari did not disappoint.  An amazing and helpful staff work at this hotel.  Everyone is friendly, and welcoming.  The rooms are large (for London) and very well appointed.  Housekeeping (daily) is well done.  The food and beverage options in the bar and restaurant are very good.  Nothing about The Hari disappoints.  The location in Belgravia is excellent for those that like to walk and see the sights.  The hotel is also very close to several London Tube stations."
February 2022,Amazing to be back,"Another more than great visit at The Hari! I must say I do feel at home there. The staff is super well trained and friendly. The food and accommodation are of great quality! The value for money is amazing even more as it is in Belgravia, one of the most exclusive district in the world. It feels so special! Also had the pleasure to meet Andrew again, the general manager who runs this place very well. I am becoming a true ambassador as it is so rare to find such authentic hotel!"
March 2022,Visit from Pittsburgh PA for son's bachelor weekend and football match,"I stayed at the hotel years ago under different name, and while great then, it far exceeded this time round.  We were visiting for my sons bachelor weekend and to explore and see a football match from Mar 10-14.  From day of arrival reception from front desk staff (didnt get name but 10 am hour on March 10) Diego and doorman, all made us feel very welcome and took care to assist with storing bags till room ready.  The rooms and service were excellent each day, clean and refreshed.  We ate breakfast several days and received excellent service in restaurant.  The highlight of our stay though has to be the treatment and service we received in the upstairs bar area each night when returning from our day out.  From night 1 meeting Marta and her setting the tone of excellent service,…"
December 2021,Disappointing,"This hotel (I think) was an ex-Sheraton and it is not up to normal London standards. The bar is cramped and the service is really slow and over priced. The terrace is more like a tiny yard, so don't be fooled by the wide angle photo. The rooms are pretty small as is the shower room. For the prices charged we have stayed in much better London Hotels. Everything was just OK and that is being kind. Oh, except the staff who are lovely"
March 2022,Incredible stay!!,"This stay has been incredible. Nothing to fault. All staff have been amazing. So friendly and helpful. But have to highlight in particular how incredible Maria has been. She went above and beyond to make my partners trip so special and I’m so grateful. She organised cake, balloons, drinks, chocolates. She’s amazing! We have thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Thank you to you all! We would definitely stay here again and bring our pup next time! Fab location too."
March 2022,Little Gem,"My friend and I visited the Hari for brunch in the Italian restaurant and enjoyed it so much we stayed in the hotel for more drinks.  This is a real gem of a place with very attentive staff especially Kyanu who was a delightful waiter, nothing was too much.  We will definitely be back I can't recommend this beautiful hotel enough."
March 2022,Great little hotel!,My friend and I attended the Hari for dinner recently and all I can say is what a gem! The minute we walked in we felt welcome. All the staff were friendly and happy to help.  The cocktails were superb and the food delicious. The service was quick and efficient.  I love the decor. Especially the current Beatles pictures on display. A must for any fan.  The Manager Alex was so warm and helpful when we asked for recommendations of local places and knowledgeable in his directions.  It’s the loveliest place I’ve been in a while. Will definitely be back.
March 2022,Amazing experience,"I came on  the 4th with a friend of mine to the hari and was the first time for us, we had a reservation to the restaurant but we went first to have a cocktail in the bar where peppe welcoming us and suggest two of the art cocktail list and they were amazing!! Than we went to the restaurant il pampero and Naomi and Sandra were looking after us suggesting food and wine  .All the staff was so welcoming and so knowledgeable we will come back for sure !!"
April 2022,An intimate city escape ,"Coming back to The Hari feels like coming back home - not just the familiarity but the warmth of the hospitality and service. The King Premium rooms are spacious by London standards, the Bar and The Italian restaurant have an easy intimacy, superbly helmed by Juan and Giuseppe respectively. The hotel is populated with exciting contemporary art and the decor suggests warmth and brilliant design. The neighbourhood now has amazing shops and cafes and bars that add to the whole experience.  Overall - a property that becomes a residence whenever one is in London. "
April 2022,Nice but ...?,So reading the waxing lyrical reviews of this hotel we expected something more.   Don’t get me wrong it is a decent place with very nice staff but to be the number four (at time of writing) London hotel on TA is frankly absurd.   We spent three nights in a Hari Suite.  One reason we took this suite was because of the fireplace which we love while in the UK.  More later … Welcome is fine.  Décor and entrance are nice but underwhelming by 5 star London standards. Lifts are small.   We had booked a table on the ‘beautiful’ terrace for dinner.  You could not make up how unlovely this small room is.  As it was populated by a family with kids and the size of my living room it was not conducive to a peaceful evening.  We assumed it was a holding area or bar but no – this was the…
April 2022,Bar and Terrace,"Had wonderful time in this lovely place, the atmosphere is cozy and private had a magic memory of the supervisor Naomi suggesting us what to drink from their signatures cocktails,  For sure we will come back asap"
March 2022,incredibile experience,I had such a fabulous stay in this place becoming my new favorite place for cocktails and food in central London . They welcoming us since the beginning and the cocktail list is fabulous. Many thanks to Naomi to make our cocktails with such an attention to the details and to Kyanu for making our evening special and unforgettable we will come back for sure!
April 2022,Great little boutique hotel,"Liked everything about this hotel but most of all the lovely friendly staff. The hotel has a warmth and distinctiveness that you just don’t get chain hotels.  Room we had was very comfortable, tastefully decorated and in excellent condition.  Breakfast is a  la cart and of a high quality.  It’s in a quiet area with no noticeable street noise.  Despite it being in a quiet area it’s a good base with easy access to all parts of the city. A couple of tube stations less than 10 minutes walk.  A big thumbs up!"
April 2022,Visit to our friendly Hari Hotel,Friendly staff - our home from home in London - bar area exceptional and location great - can walk to everything - if you don’t know about this hotel you should check it out - chef in restaurant produces amazing Italian dishes 
April 2022,Amazing Stay at The Hari!,The Hari was simply wonderful from start to finish. We were enthuiastically greeted by a fantastic front desk staff which was the beginning of an amazing stay here. The rooms are modern yet not overdone. The hotel itself just has a charm that is hard to replicate. The bar area and terrace were very cute too. The concierge was super helpful throughout our trip providing great recos and helping to get us to the airport when we were running very far behind. I loved that this boutique hotel felt intitmate in the best way possible. It is also perfectly situated with access to the touristy attractions including museums as well as for luxury shopping. I would highly recommend + also stay here again.
September 2022,Amazing luxury hotel experience in a beautiful neighborhood,"Great location. Neighborhood of Belgravia is home to lots of beautiful buildings (mostly embassies so it's fairly quiet after hours and on weekends). Walking distance from Hyde Park and Green Park. 10-15 min uber to the many areas nearby with lots of bars and restaurants, but if you want to be near to the main busy areas but still far enough away to not be overwhelmed, this is it. Staff was extremely helpful.  Hotel was actually on the small end and had a boutique vibe, while also having all the services and amenities of a larger hotel. Outstanding experience overall and would definitely stay here again on the next London trip."
August 2022,Joyful and romantic!,This is our second time staying at the Hari. Last year we got married in London and this is where we stayed. It made total sense to come back for our anniversary and the hotel only gets better. The staff are lovey and welcoming. The rooms are lovely. And the mezzanine bar area and roof terrace are a joy for just chilling. To top it all off they left a stunning combination of flowers and cake in our room to help us celebrate! I couldn’t recommend a better hotel in London!
September 2022,Another great stay,The Hari is the most friendly place without being intrusive. Lovely staff.  Bedrooms are really comfy and thank god for the totally fantastic air conditioning! Ive left a review before but am happy to do another because it is such a well run hotel.
August 2022,Excellent service!,"My husband and I traveled for 4 weeks across 4 different countries, and our favorite stay was at the Hari.  The team at the Hari provided excellent service. Maria at the front desk greeted us with a warm welcome and sent us a complimentary bottle of champagne and bar snacks (we were on our honeymoon). Several kind surprises were left at our room for us to celebrate. Diego, at concierge, was incredibly helpful in assisting us with bookings for restaurants, and gave us some great recommendations too.   Second, the rooms are cozy and comfortable. The Hari also implements sustainable practices to make their business more environmentally friendly, such as card-activated electricity. As someone who tries to make eco-conscious decisions, I appreciate these details!  The Hari is also…"
August 2022,a disappointing new experience in London,"Great staff and very welcoming, good location. However extremely disappointing room. Very small despite being premium, and really impractical bathroom. Lots of noise from road and passers by below, and we were on 7th floor.Restaurant good quality, service and ambience, shame about the room."
August 2022,MyaforiteplaceinLondon,"I’ve been in the Hari hotel because my husband organised a dinner as a surprise for my birthday in the italian restaurant Il Pampero and what to say ?! Everything was exceptional we were so happy to be seated in the booth that was really romantic and on the table was a little card from the Hari staff and a rose, for dinner we had the seabass in crust salt and Naomi the supervisor was looking after us and she was so knowledgeable we also meet the Chef Andrea that suggest some dishes for the next time because we will come back for sure.  At the and the waitress Deborah did a little cake with the candle on top.  For me was the best birthday ever and next time i will stay for sure at the hotel because the staff and the food is so authentic italian!!"
August 2022,Wonderful Hotel,We recently had a wonderful short stay at the stunning Hari Hotel. The service we experienced was nothing short of excellent. The attention to detail throughout the hotel is superb. Big thank you to Jorge and Charlie Brown who helped with the details of our reservation. Can’t wait to return!
August 2022,Calm in the city,"Lovely hotel. Done properly with attention from the staff and calming atmosphere after a busy day in the city. We used the parking so easy door to door. Great access to parks, shopping and concerts at the Albert Hall."
August 2022,Outstanding stay,"Room, staff, food—all excellent. Any extra or special request was attended to right away and correctly. The architecture of the rooms brings the outside inside, while maintaining privacy. Couldn’t have asked for better. "
August 2022,"Best place to have a rest after intense day of work , recommend for solo visits , nice bartenders Victor and Giusepe","It was a lovely time what I spent here. Special thank for Victor the bartender and waiter Sergio, who are good company. I can’t wait to go back with my friends and family, to have the same wonderful experience. Also big plus for smoking cigars in the terrace. The all team were super friendly and adorable. Many thanks!"
April 2022,Amazing Hotel!!,"Amazing experience. My husband has cancer and this was a big trip for him. He mentioned that he really liked the art behind the desk because he has flown jets and Bruno and Maria bought a frame and sent a photo of the jet with a lovely card and chocolate to him. Our concierge, Ricardo was also amazing. Everyone was so friendly and went out of our way to make us comfortable. "
April 2022,Made Our Trip,"Maria and the team went above and beyond when we stayed with them. They really did make it a trip to remember. It was my partners birthday and they helped me with the surprises for my partner. I really couldn't have asked for it to go better. Nothing was an issue, and the bed gave me one of the best night sleeps I've had in a long time. I wish I could have taken it home!"
April 2022,The Perfect London Location,"from a warm, welcoming reception to the most delicious food during the stay, I would recommend the Hari for those who might be unsure of where to find the best of the best in London. The hotel and staff are not pretentious in the slightest but the whole experience still feels very exclusive and special. You can walk to all the finest places and the retreat to the most comfortable and quiet room for a great night sleep. Looking forward to next time!"
May 2023,Always fantastic!,"Every stay seems to be better than the last. By far my favourite hotel in London. I love the location, just a short walk from some lovely restaurants. Although I am a big fan of the Italian restaurant in the hotel. Great cocktails there too! The room I stayed in has also been refurbished with a fresh new look.  The team are super friendly. I recommend to all my friends."
May 2023,Lovely!,"The staff is what makes the Hari so amazing.  They are all a pleasure to interact with, helpful, friendly and make every effort possible to ensure a great stay!  They are also a world-class hotel with a fantastic Italian restaurant and lovely bar/lounge area with plenty of seating and great service."
May 2023,Perfection,This was our second stay at the Hari and we had the most wonderful experience. We truly feel like guests when we stay at the Hari! The entire staff is friendly and goes out of their way to ensure you have a great experience. They know the true meaning of hospitality!
November 2022,A wonderful stay,"I had a wonderful stay at this 5 star hotel whilst I travelled on business. The welcome from the reception was very warm on arrival and everything was prepared as I had requested. I had asked for a room with a bath if possible and I was delighted that they accommodated my request.   I thought the price point was great for a hotel in this area and of this standard, it had a small intimate feel to it and it felt very comfortable. The room itself was small but lovely and perfectly adequate for my needs.  The complimentary minibar was a lovely touch. Turndown was offered both nights, one night I had some chocolates and the second night a wax lip balm which were both excellent.   The hotel prides itself on sustainability and it was great to see the considerations that had gone into…"
November 2022,The Hari..you are Exceptional!,"Back again and this was another perfect stay. The service, and the hospitality of this place just gets better and better. Such a cozy and lovely boutique hotel. This is the place to stay in in London. Perfect location. We can walk to Harrods, Hyde Park and the lively Knightsbridge area which is around the corner. The bed is super comfy and Bruno at the front desk is so nice and so helpful . The entire staff is extremely helpful and make you feel at home."
November 2022,Perfection,"What a gem, everything about our experience was special from the start to the end the super slick service, stylish on trend interior.  Best nights sleep and  bathrooms to die for.  Immaculate rooms and impeccable  service, attention to  detail.   Will not stay anywhere else in London ever again, certainly a 5 star experience, luxurious. "
October 2022,Hari London,"Unique hotel with unique rooms overlooking a garden.  Separate window box sitting areas and/or tubs very nice.  Rooms not large but well finished.  Very good restaurant for breakfast, nice bar for pre night cocktail or late night cap.  Location excellent walked to most everything.  Had a challenge with AC a few hot days in June but got through it.  Expensive but for London, location and quality, a repeat for us."
July 2022,"Plush, understated and personal","I was drawn to this property for its location (near where I wanted to be in the city) and its smaller size. I wanted a quiet hotel in a serene part of town and that's exactly what The Hari delivers. The service I experienced was very good which started with my room being ready early. My travel plans changed while I was there and they also helped me extend my stay one night and remain in the same room.  I love the understated elegance of the hotel. It's posh but cozy. With only 80-some rooms it never felt crowded anywhere including the two elevators. In fact, I only rode the elevator with another person once. I dined in the restaurant several times during my stay (breakfast and dinner) and thought the food and atmosphere was lovely. I also enjoyed a drink in the bar (with their…"
October 2022,A great stay at the Hari London,"We had a super wedding anniversary celebration at the Hari. Nice spacious quiet room. Helpful staff throughout. Good restaurant and excellent Belgravia location, close to Piccadilly, Knightsbridge, Sloane Square and Victoria."
October 2022,Lovely welcome and stay,"My friends and I with their two small children had a lovely stay and lunch at the Hari , the team made us feel welcome and at ease and were so nice to accommodate us with a large table and a dedicated service. Alex and Vittorio took excellent care of us all. The children and us loved the food and will definitely be back again."
October 2022,Great place to stay in Belgravia,"Great location, great staff, nice and clean  rooms and bathrooms and impeccable service. The personnel is helpful and efficient.  I love the Hari and would highly recommend it. The bar is also a nice hang out with amazing drinks and the Italian restaurant is so good!"
October 2022,So very grateful,"My experience at this wonderful hotel is fairly unique.  For me, unfortunately, my first time ever to London I was quite sick.  The hotel was comfortable, clean, well appointed, cozy, classy and the staff was first rate. They were all exceptionally kind and encouraging of my situation and in particular Bruno....we was very supportive and went out of his way to be helpful.  Someday I hope to have a 'do-over' in London and return to this special hotel....and hopefully see less of my room and more of London!  "
September 2022,Business Stay,"I stayed on business for a couple days due to the train strikes. The rooms are comfortable and come with an array of amenities. On arrival I had a delicious pastry and was sent up a much welcomed whisky sour, which must have been noted as my drink of choice from my previous stay!  The breakfast service was very efficient and set me up well for the day. The hotel is set in a great location and you cannot fault it.  The staff are always welcoming and I look forward to my next stay."
January 2023,The Disappointing Decline of The Hari,"Disappointing decline of The Hari, which is a shame as I am a regular guest to the hotel and especially to the restaurants/dining areas, but the unfriendliness, lack of respect and abrupt nature of the front-facing staff is simply unforgivable. It was not too long ago London's hospitality was begging for international visitors to return...you'd think they would keep this in mind when interacting with guests in an irritable manner for no reason at all. Sadly it's becoming known among our circles that The Hari is not what it used to be. P.S When we interact with your staff with politeness and respect, we expect a little of that back..especially as regulars."
January 2023,Cozy stay and I also love the neighbourhood!,"After traveling around the Europe for a week and more, I was back to London, where I last travelled to three years ago. I spent my first few nights at The Hari, London. It was some vey quality and relaxing time!   The Hari London is located at the heart of Belgravia, bordering the areas of Chelsea, Kensington and Knightsbridge. I have stayed at some other areas (Mayfair, Marylebone and Canary Wharf) before and just like what Google said - Belgravia is ""unlike anywhere else in London"" and the Regency architecture is of such a unique, elegant glamour.  The Hari London itself is a very beautiful property and both the public area and the room design were really cool. The lounge area was very comfy with a wide collection of artworks around. The suite I stayed was really nice and my…"
November 2022,Wonderful stay,"Wonderful experience staying at The Hari; everyone was very nice and professional.  The only comment I have is that I wish the bathroom had more privacy as it is completely transparent, not very convenient when one wants to use the facilities and have guests in the room. "
December 2022,Beautiful boutique hotel in the heart of London,"Beautifully appointed luxury hotel in the heart of London near Harrod's.  I stayed here on business but what a perfect location for being in the center of the sites. The room itself was gorgeous with high-end products and amenities. I love when hotels provide slippers -it seems such a simple gesture, but means the world to me.  They also had me at the chocolate truffles left on the desk and chocolates on the pillow after the turn-down service (they know the way into my heart)."
November 2022,An incredible experience from start to finish!,The entire team at The Hari went above and beyond during our stay! The suite was stunning and the location can’t be beat.  We’ll be staying here again during our next trip to London!  Sincerely appreciate everything about this place!
November 2022,what an amazing hotel,"What can I say about my experience at this hotel ?  Just one word, spectacular. They welcomed us with a warm welcome along with a cocktail, a special thanks goes to Naomi and Sandra who assisted us all the time with a smile and with so much kindness. Also I was amazed by the beauty of the hotel, the photos did not make enough, an immensity of details that are highlighted by the beautiful lights. The way the hotel is divided into two parts has made me crazy, below we have a room characterized by the restaurant and quiet music and overwhelming for those like me love to relax and above we have a more cheeky and refreshing side for those who love fun. Thanks again and can’t wait to return"
November 2022,"Great service, perfect location and very elegant boutique hotel.","It was my first time at The Hari and, I must admit, it was not my first choice when I was looking for a hotel. Mostly because I knew nothing about it. It was the Founders Card representative that insisted that I was going to be extremely pleased with the whole experience and that, for sure, I would become a repeat customer. She was right! I will be going there once again in December and probably every time I will be in London. Great service, perfect location and very elegant boutique hotel."
November 2022,Great service and amazing service,"One if the best hotels I have stayed at in London. The service is amazing and the staff are very helpful. Also the location is perfect, close to everything and a short want to the best places.   Will definitely stay here again and I would recommend it"
November 2022,An incredible experience from start to finish,"An incredible experience from start to finish.  Alex at the front desk, Ben the concierge and the doormen were all very helpful.  Can’t wait to stay here again and will be back soon on our next visit to London!"
November 2022,Beautiful hotel with very warm staff.,"I visited the Hari for one night with my daughter for her birthday. Alex was so helpful in arranging the stay and Marzia ensured everything went smoothly while we were there. Everyone from housekeeping, room service, doormen and the restaurant staff were so warm and welcoming.  They made the weekend feel very special.  I’d forgotten my charger and they We’re quick to lend me one.  The room, amenities and hotel facilities were all lovely and well Looked after.  We’ll definitely be back. "
March 2023,Impeccable Service! 5 Stars isn't Enough! ,"My wife and I stayed for a week on our first visit to London. The hotel itself is modern and beautifully designed in the elegant neighborhood of Belgravia. The location is perfect for exploring the city. While all the major sites and neighborhoods are a short distance away, there are also many quality restaurants, pubs, and cocktail lounges within walking distance. Be prepared to be wowed by the amazing architecture of the Georgian style townhomes as you stroll around the neighborhood. Our room was clean and accommodating. The linens were plush and the bed comfortable. We dined in the restaurant one evening and had an amazing meal. All of this being said, what really makes this property unique is the service. The friendly and attentive staff were at the ready to make certain the…"
February 2023,Amazing week-end at the Hari !,My husband and I stayed at the Hari for three nights and didn't want to leave the hotel at the end of our stay! We were received perfectly by Alex and his team and had some amazing surprises in our room for our stay. The Suite was very beautiful and spacious and the hotel is in a perfect location for walking around London. We will sure come back at the Hari for our futures holidays in London.  
February 2023,Great place to stay in London,The location of The Hari is excellent. Nice and quiet yet walkable to so many sites. Hotel staff were outstanding and very helpful. Rooms are beautifully done. Restaurant food was very good.  Staff always available to help.  
February 2023,Wonderful eco-conscious hotel in Belgravia with great staff and great views from the higher floors!,"From the moment we arrived we were taken such good care of, and the hotel is a fantastic location - near to lots of sights but quiet and secluded enough to get a good nights sleep. Big thank you to Ben the Head Concierge and Marzia in Guest Relations for their amazing service and for making our stay very memorable. We’d had drinks in the bar on a previous visit but really glad we were able to spend the night this time - our room on the 8th floor had a wonderful view - and had a lovely breakfast in the morning. The hotel should also be commended for its commitment to sourcing sustainable products - clearly a lot of thought had gone into what products were in the room and bathroom. I wish all hotels would do this!"
February 2023,Best Hotel in Belgravia,"We had an amazing stay at The Hari, wonderful location in the heart of Belgravia. The bedroom was very comfortable, the staff extremely helpful and polite. Very tasteful breakfast with rich a-la-carte choice. We felt very pampered, definitely recommended!"
February 2023,Wonderful !!,Amazing stay at The hari ! We enjoyed the quality of the room and the bed : the view from the room is beautiful night and day ! Also the staff was really nice. We highly recommend this hotel. Thank you very much.
February 2023,Brilliant boutique hotel,"We enjoyed our stay immensely, check in was quick and easy, we were welcomed to the bar for a complimentary drink and snacks, the staff were really friendly and attentive - we couldn’t recommend the hotel more."
January 2023,Beautiful Hotel,"We had the best time at The Hari, staff are so welcoming and friendly. We stayed in the King premium room. Very clean, stylish, and the bed was super comfy! Breakfast in the morning was delicious, will definitely be booking again soon. "
January 2023,Wonderful experience,"What a fabulous time we had here. The wines were delicious , Vittorio was amazing , he suggested a red wine that we really loved -Will definitely go back to drink it again .Our waiter Charis was very attentive and always with the smile. We loved this place and we will definitely visit again . An amazing place to spend an evening out with friends!!!!"
January 2023,Nothing short of AMAZING 🫵🙏,Nothing short of AMAZING  I stayed for the first time at Hotel The Hari. I got sublime reception and subsequent super service. Had a wonderful evening in their restaurant and their concierge helped with tickets to the musical.   I will be a regular guest in the future both privately but also when I have to do business.   See you soon ;0)   Thomas R
March 2023,"Great staff, great location","My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at The Hari and will certainly stay there when in London in the future. The staff is very attentive - they seem to personally keep track of all their guests' preferences (beyond the usual databases) and try to facilitate an enjoyable stay.  There was a fire in a restaurant next door to the hotel on our last night. In an abundance of caution, the London fire people required adjacent buildings like the Hari to be ready to evacuate, so we all had to leave our rooms and wait in the ground floor restaurant in case the fire department wanted to rush us out. Eventually (1AM) we got the all-clear and were able to go back to our rooms.  The Hari staff handled this unexpected development beautifully. It was late at night when you would expect a…"
May 2023,Another lovely stay,This is the second time we have stayed at The Hari and the experience was just as good as the first time. 1st thing to comment on is the Staff. They are excellent from the moment you arrive to the point you leave they were always friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble.   We ate at Il Pampero and the food once again was excellent and the staff attentive without being intrusive. The first time we stayed we had some issues with breakfast but this time everything food wise was fine. One thing that could be improved is having a side plate and a knife for things like bread and toast.    The room we had overlooked the park opposite the hotel and provided a lovely view. Bedding was good and the bed was comfortable. The room was very clean and the staff kept the…
April 2023,Our London Home,"The hotel is just plain perfect: beautiful, clean, quiet, with the nicest staff. Its location can't be beat, a short walk to shopping spots, halfway between Knightsbridge (Harrods) and Sloane Square (King's Road). We had liked it last year, loved it even more this year. It feels like our London home."
May 2023,Great Experience,"Perfect location! Perfect design! There will be one option for us in London forever that is the Hari Hotel.. Rooms view is amazing,we saw London eye in our room.. Location is important for your hotel choice but not only ! many hotels at london  are very old ,dirty and too small rooms! But, the Hari perfect location , new designed by famous architect, every workers 7-24 smiling and honesty!  Thank you for that great experience! Feyza Ertürk"
April 2023,Great hotel. Great location.,"Great hotel. Super handy. Brilliant service. The hotel was immaculate and super stylish.  If you’re looking for five star hotel on the more affordable scale in London, this is definitely the hotel for you. "
April 2023,Like no other,To begin with The Hari is absolutely gorgeous! It’s in an excellent location. What makes the Hari stand out from any other hotel we have ever stayed at is its employees. I wish I remembered their names because they so deserve the recognition. Here’s a few examples: 1. we needed more water and they brought it up immediately. When we tried to tip they said no thank you it is not necessary and did we need anything else. 2. We decided to mail a birthday card and asked where we can buy a postage stamp. How many do you need? The concierge opens a drawer and hands us one. No charge. He makes sure it’s addressed correctly and also puts an air mail sticker in it. 3. We need more pounds and ask where we can find a place on a Sunday. They look it up and give us directions. Upon returning…
April 2023,London Hotel,"The Hari is an amazing boutique hotel, where the service is exceptional. The rooms were lovely, clean and spacious, and the restaurant was charming and delicious. The staff was very helpful and friendly, as well. I HIGHLY recommend this hotel for anyone visiting London! "
January 2023,One of the best hotels I have experienced,"I can't say enough about my recent stay at The Hari which was truly delightful. What an unparalleled experience this was from start to finish. The entire staff is a class act, and even the expected amenities of a luxury hotel like this felt even more elevated and personal here. Loved the staff from the door to the front desk who were so welcoming and ensured I was nothing but relaxed and taken care of during my stay from the second I set foot on the property.  When I went to the Concierge for suggestions of a restaurant that would still be open after a show I was seeing in the West End, Ben didn't just hand me a list, he made calls and secured a reservation for me. Someone kindly checked on me once I had gotten settled in to ask if everything was ok in the room. Even the…"
January 2023,Just perfect! ,"I was on the 8th floor, and the view was spectacular. Very clean room, the bed the pillows and the covers are of excellent quality, the staff is super friendly and it's in an amazing location. Overall, a perfect ecperience. "
January 2023,As always lovely stay at The Hari,"Once again an outstanding stay at The Hari, As always a very comfortable room, with great views and complimentary mini bar.  The team at The Hari are always very friendly and happy to help out, from the minute you enter the building.  Spent one evening on the terrace which was fantastic with great service."
January 2023,Wonderful & Relaxing,"My recent stay at The Hari, was a last minute decision that was efficiently handled by the warm and welcoming staff working that evening, ensuring all was ready for my impromptu arrival. From the moment I entered the Hotel, the stress of my day faded and my mood was rapidly adapted to that of the relaxed and welcoming atmosphere this place provides. I enjoyed a few drinks in the comforting bar, before retiring to the room, which itself was luxurious and incredibly well equipped, allowing for a peaceful sleep in an incredibly comfortable bed. I ended the stay with a delicious breakfast, before heading off to meetings feeling relaxed, recharged and ready for the day."
January 2023,Lovely stay at The Hari,"We just had a lovely stay at The Hari this week.  The room was very comfortable a with views to the picturesque garden in front of the property. The quality of the mattress and bed linen made it hard to leave the bed in the morning.  Complimentary mini bar was a pleasant surprise, not very usual with other places I had stayed. The visit to the bar on the first floor was a perfect night in. Alessio, Naomi and Caris were spot on with their cocktail recommendations (Casa Azul was my favorite!)  and were very attentive."
January 2023,The best service in town,"Great room, great views, great location, wonderful range of amenities and the greatest service possible. Every single team member really cared and wanted to help with anything. This is the best, and certainly the perfect location for exploring the local attractions."
December 2022,Great hotel,"The hotel was absolutely incredible! Friendly staff, beautiful rooms and good service. The hotel is located in a very calm neighbourhood but in a few minutes you are in the center of London. I would definitely recommend it!"
August 2023,Amazing Staff and Hotel,"From the moment you enter this Hotel you are greeted with amazing service and attention to detail, the staff provide an extremely friendly environment  and nothing is too much for them. Will definitely be returning."
August 2023,4-star hotel in a 5-star area,"Hotel is nice but nothing really special. A couple of mechanical problems but the staff fixed them and was willing to relocate us if we were dissatisfied (the fixes worked but we were told the problem - condensation pump failure - happened all the time during the summer). Staff was very friendly and hotel is in a very good quiet part of Belgravia, near the foreign embassies and a short walk to Hyde Park and to Victoria Station. I don't think we'd stay here again - because there are lots of other choices in London not especially anything against the hotel."
July 2023,Amazing stay,"Last weekend we had the opportunity to stay at The Hari hotel again. Amazing as it has always, on the top of its game for years. The rooms have been recently refurbished and given a new light to its luxury. Bed is soooo comfy.... Dinner was assisted by super starts Sante and Evie. Whatever you order, consider a small portion of their divine cacio & pepe pasta. Thank you again"
July 2023,The Hari is a Top Notch Hotel,"The Hari is a top notch hotel.  The rooms and common areas are extremely well maintained with mid century modern decor.  The staff is especially impressive; they were friendly and helpful during our entire stay.  I highly recommend this property,   Note:  We frequented a fabulous little cafe around the corner from The Hari,  Anya Cafe.  It’s perfect for sitting outside to people watch while having breakfast, lunch and drinks.  "
July 2023,Very Comfortable Stay,"The staff at the hotel from the reception to the concierge, the people at the front door and at the restaurant were all very frinedly. The hotel is locted in a great location close to meny great restaurants and shopping areas. The rooms like new and were very comfortable."
July 2023,Very Nice Boutique Hotel-needs some adjustments to earn 5 Star rate and pricing,"hotel lovely-staff very helpful Bar was not properly stocked-many items on menu unavailable for the week were there. AC definitely inadequate in room and public spaces-welcome dinner with Grand Slam Tennis tour overwhelmingly HOT. Fans set up but where was AC? never given answer except ""Working on it"""
July 2023,5-star experience,"I had a very positive experience at the Hari when I visited earlier this summer. I found the staff was helpful and friendly, and the rooms were well-appointed and clean. The location was fantastic as well!  I will definitely plan to stay at this property again on my next trip to London."
July 2023,"Amazing service, amazing food",I went to the Hari first floor for the food & the Waitress Evie was absolutely amazing. She recommended us the best food we could’ve possibly eaten & it was worth EVERY single penny. I will definitely be coming back & getting the same food again. The whole staff was excellent and so helpful as well. Thank you Evie & the Hari team once again. It was a pleasure. 
July 2023,"Fantastic, warm welcome",A year since we were last here. What a lovely warm welcome. Made us feel like we were coming “back home”.  We cant recommend this hotel and its team. More highly.  Fantastic service and location. Many thanks.
July 2023,Christmas Lunch ❤️,"The hari hotel… What a place !! Absolutely loved it..  We joined the hari on Christmas lunch with a group of 8 people and the moment we walked in we felt like home, everyone’s was so nice and friendly starting from the security guys at the front door.  You can smell that amazing elegant and refined perfumes which they use ! (Which I personally loved it)  We had lunch at the Pampero restaurant, but before that the Manager Vittorio bought us upstairs to a little tour at the terrace. ( I assumed he was the manager because of the way he was talking to us and the suit)   The hotel has such an amazing design and decoration! (So classy)  The lunch it was outstanding, the food it was 10/10 and the service it was brilliant!!   Vittorio is definitely a star, he went above and beyond our…"
January 2023,New Years 2023,"Everyone is so welcoming, rooms nice and location great!  Even when i dropped an earring and it shot under the cabinet - they cam equipped and found it!  This was my second stay.   I highly recommend The Hari.  Ps -special shout out to Ricardo and Sam!  "
December 2022,Home from Home,"I can’t rave enough about the staff at the Hari.   Florin was the ultimate gem. Greeted us at breakfast at 7am then made us drinks in the bar. He was truly lovely.  I hope he and his wife and baby are happy and healthy.  The girl who was guarding the tables at the library bar was doing a great jo.b with pure difficult clients.   I had a passport issue and the staff were so fantastic. It really made it so much easier for me. Getting up at 7 on new year’s day and being offered an espresso while waiting for your car is beyond.  Beautiful neighborhood, beautiful room, exceptional people. I will always remember them fondly."
December 2022,Beautiful hotel in the heart of the city,"Love the Hari, its a cozy home from home while traveling. The staff couldn’t be more helpful and accommodating. The location is excellent, right in the heart of the city. I will definitely be booking to stay again!  "
April 2022,Unforgettable Experience,"I’ve  been with some friends to this unbelievable place, we were welcoming from the beginning from the doorman (I think his name was Chris). We had a reservation for the restaurant but we decided to go for a drink to the bar first, where Naomi gave us a very warm welcome. She patiently describes the stunning art cocktail list, i tried the cocktails dedicated to Banksy.  Then we went to the restaurant where Giuseppe and Sandra make us feel at home. The octopus was the best thing of my life!  We will definitely come back, and maybe try to have a night in this wonderful place, thank you all!"
April 2022,Brilliant service,"Would highly recommend the minute you walk in you feel very welcome, the staff are so friendly and polite. We had drinks in the beautiful terrace. The hotel was very clean and I loved the decor! Can’t wait to visit again."
April 2022,Susan Rushton,Was made welcomed and service was quick and presented very professionally and polite  Staff were friendly would definitely go back and hotel was clean and spotless  Very easy to get to hotel from tube station
April 2022,Unreal service,We have just left after a one night stay and after trawling option after option we settled on the Hari from a location point of view.   Having booked on the way down I sent the usual cheeky request as it was my partners birthday and didn’t really expect anything of it.   What we received was the warmest welcome to a hotel I have ever encountered from Bruno and Tony on reception along with a complimentary room upgrade and welcome drink.   I would also like to complement the door men and especially the gent on our exit (the one who doesn’t like truffle :)   Having returned to the room after dinner we were then greeted by a bottle of bubbly and a dessert in the room along with the most thoughtful birthday card.   Barring the fact this place has the best bed in a hotel I have slept…
April 2022,Perfect Brunch,"My friend and I had a wonderful time at The Hari for their weekend brunch.  Staff were kind and helpful and couldn’t do enough for you. The drinks and food were superb. The hotel is beautiful and modern. Would highly recommend a visit and if you get the opportunity, stop for a drink on the beautiful terrace.  Special thanks goes to the food and beverage staff who were wonderful and to Sante - a simply perfect host.  We are planning a return visit already - thank you."
March 2022,Anniversary trip,"Great location in a quiet area. Brilliant welcome from all staff. Has an intimate feel even though it has many rooms. Rooms were well equipped and bed very comfortable. We have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and we will be back. Staff selection, training and leadership seem to work well here."
April 2022,Comfortable and Stylish,Spent a night when heading to a wedding - had a great stay - nice modern room with a great bed and stylish bathroom.   The bar was good too  We had breakfast in our room via room service and it was a good decision.   Would recommend and would stay again.
March 2022,Lovely Boutique Hotel,"Spent 4 nights on holiday. Location is  very  central that is hard to beat, being close to all the shopping, museums, and restaurants we needed.   Very helpful staff with  very quick check-in/out.  Modern but warm and cozy interior, tastefully done.  clean rooms.  Will be back."
March 2022,The hotel has friendly staff !,"We stayed there for the first time, claudio made sure it was the best stay , definitely coming back for the next time , make sure to book the studio suite its the Best! Friendly staff , lovely accommodation ."
March 2022,Superb stay!,"What a hotel! The decor, the comfort, the staff, the quality, everything was spot on. And it's a great location - Knightsbridge and Sloane Square tube stations are both walking distance. I can't wait to come back and stay again!"
January 2023,Over expectations!,"The hotel is located in the best neighborhood of London; it is very close to where you want to be and far enough from chaos, noise, etc. The atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming, bar is great, the staff very kind and helpful. In addition the reception staff took care to prepare for us of a totally unexpected surprise; by far this was over any expectation! Well done, we'll be back again when visiting London."
January 2023,Beautiful Property in London,"We recently stayed at the Hari for a short stay, our room was on the 8th floor and we had amazing views of the City including St Pauls Cathedral. the room was immaculate and extremely well maintained with helpful and friendly staff. The complementary champagne in our room was greatly received!!  We would stay again and will recommend.. Thank you to all staff at the Hari"
January 2023,Lovely Spontaneity at The Hari,"My partner and I recently stayed overnight at the lovely Hari in Belgravia. Our spontaneous visit was incredibly relaxing and full of thoughtful touches from staff, including a personalized welcome note and delicious treats waiting in our room. Our view of London was to die for and our accommodation very luxurious. From our bed, we fell asleep with The London Eye, St. Paul’s and The Shard in our eyesight. We enjoyed a restful night and woke refreshed, the perfect tonic to a long week. You’ll be hard-pressed to find a better location to lay your head in the heart of one of London’s most beautiful neighborhoods. We would not hesitate to re-book at The Hari and hope to visit again soon!"
January 2023,Great hotel,"Fantastic service, loads of little touches above and beyond expectations (room prep, freebies, quality of minibar offer etc), cant really say more.... great restaurant as well - best hotel ive stayed at in London."
December 2022,Great place to stay in London,"Fabulous stay,  comfortable beds, great facilities, friendly helpful staff. I loved staying there and will definitely be back. And we had a fabulous view as well. Great location  in a lovely area with easy access to tourist  spots"
December 2022,Wonderful pre-Christmas stay at The Hari,"We had the most superb stay here just before Christmas. Unfortunately, my house move didn't quite go to plan, so after a very long day of packing, we checked into The Hari - which was an incredible treat! We arrived late evening after dinner, and upon check-in were invited for a drink in the bar - the Christmas decorations and Christmas tree were phenomenal.   When we then got up to the room, it was perfect - we were only on the 6th floor - but could still see The Shard and The London Eye from our window - I imagine the top floors have even more incredible views. Unfortunately we travelled without a toothbrush and toothpaste, and upon calling room service, they were brought up in minutes by housekeeping. After a hot (waterfall!) shower, the beds were so comfortable, just what we…"
January 2023,Best experience in London ever,"I had an amazing time there with my wife. It's the best place I've stayed in London, Alex was so nice with us and was there to answer all of our needs. A lot of advices to make our stay perfect and help us during our visit in London. "
December 2022,Top in Belgravia,"Great hotel, and great staff .  At the bar , Pepe is amazing , welcoming us in a proper way and the cocktails he made to us where unbelievable.  We took breakfast at the restaurant, I appreciate much the Italian eggs with burrata and truffle, also Ariana suggested us the blueberry smoothie. Was amazing.  Hope to come back soon"
December 2022,A 4-Star with 3-Star problems,"We just returned from an extended Xmas to New Year's stay at the Hari Hotel.   There are plenty of positives to say and a few disappointments that I'll address in this review.   First and foremost, as part of my company's corporate rate, it's a great place. When we extended our stay, management advised that our rate wasn't available for New Year's Eve. However, I begrudgingly accepted the new rate; they replied and agreed to honor the corporate rate, so hat's off to customer service.   The room was much smaller than we're accustomed to in London, with only two drawers in the closet and about a little under a dozen hangers. If you're staying for an extended stay or with family be prepared to mostly live out of your suitcase.    The room had a very nice extended little seating…"
December 2022,Beautiful hotel with great service and food,"Food and drink was amazing, really well made and beautifully made cocktails! And the service by Vittorio was fantastic and he checked up on us throughout the night! A great way to spend NYE. The hotel was almost beautifully decorated "
February 2022,Best experience ever,"Yesterday I had  brunch at the restaurant “Il Pampero” situated within the Hari hotel.  I can’t begin to describe what an amazing experience it was. There was live music and I have been mesmerised throughout as there was a mix of English Spanish Italian and Portuguese songs. The singer would receive song requests and always accept them with the biggest smile and kindness. Food was amazing and exceeded my expectations but what I was really surprised by was the amazing staff I had the pleasure to meet during my time there. Everyone and I mean EVERYONE went the extra mile to make sure I had the best experience ever but a particular huge thanks goes to the amazing Ariana, Dario and Nando for putting up with my requests always with a smile on their faces and for making sure I had…"
December 2021,Thank you The Hari,"Thank you  The Harry 💕 We love you  Excellent hotel, very clean, great location, quiet, and all the required services are available from cafes and restaurants.   The room is beautiful, of suitable sizes and the prices are very reasonable.   I have stayed there with my family more than once and it has become my favorite place to stay in London.   I thank the helpful and always smiling staff, especially Ms. Sabreen from the reception team for her continued cooperation and support thank you Sabreen"
February 2022,First Visit But Not Our Last!,"We stayed at The Hari as we were going to the Albert Hall to see Cirque du Soleil, what a great find. I had heard of the hotel from a friend and we were impressed from the beginning. Lovely friendly welcome from the door and reception staff. The room  was lovely, beautifully clean. Very comfy bed and great linen. The hotel is in a perfect location for Knightsbridge shopping which of course had to be done! Nice lunch at Harvey Nicholls. Some great restuarants within walking distance of the hotel. Lovely relaxed breakfast, great coffee! Many hotels shout about their great service but fail to deliver on so many levels, this hotel is genuinely good at what a £300 a night hotel should do.  We will be back soon! Thank you for a great stay."
January 2022,Continues to be one of the best hotels in London,"I have stayed many times at the hotel over the past 6 years and it continues to be my hotel of choice in London ,representing superb personal service from the wonderful staff ,a great location and extremely comfortable luxurious rooms and suites."
January 2022,Thank you The Hari again for your hospitality,As always an extraordinary experience   I stayed at The Hari for several times now and again for two nights. I just love this place...The staff is friendly and very helpful and the atmosphere makes you feel like being part of a large family. With the amazing views and a great location it will always be my first choice when I visit central London. I can not recommend enough. 🥰🥰
January 2022,The location is very excellent .. the cleanliness is excellent .. the espresso machine 👌🏻in the room and thanks sabrine🙏🏻🙏?,"The hotel is very beautiful in terms of the design of the lobby and the restaurant, as well as the arrangement of the comfortable rooms and the marble bathroom, which is an excellent area and the cleanliness is excellent. The staff are comfortable and helpful. The location is very excellent, close to everything"
January 2022,Home away from home,"... if I could afford it. I would move in. They were beyond wonderful to both me and my dog ! From the reception, amazing room service, best hotel slippers and comfortable bedding ... not to mention my favourite hotel bar/lounge in London! Perfection. "
January 2022,Always exceptional,"Choosing to stay at The Hari is guaranteeing an exceptional experience.   It is in an excellent location (walking distance from London Victoria train station, the V&A museum, Natural History Museum, Sloane Square etc.).   What I personally enjoy most is the fact that whilst it is a luxury boutique hotel, the service and welcome that you receive is always so warm and welcoming. All the staff will make conversation with you, ask if there’s anything else that you need (and often leave a little extra treat in your room, as pictured!).   I haven’t had the chance to try the gym yet, but I know that if I do the facilities will be great. Plus, I would highly recommend eating at the restaurant Il Pampero for high quality Italian food!"
December 2021,Exceptional hotel in Belgravia,"A wonderful hotel, well located close to hyde park, harrods and several good restaurants, clean and large rooms with a great view, nice lounge/bar area, very friendly staff. One should try the vegan burger and truffle fries! Definitely recommended!"
December 2021,Legendary experience,I  and my girlfriend visited your hotel on the 24 th December around 7 pm  and both of us we were amazed by the amazing and remarkable experienced we had. Both of us we were served by Naomi the bar supervisor she recommend the strargazer cocktail which it was beautifully executed by the phenomenal bartender Giuseppe. Both of them they were super professional and very engaging. After the cocktais l Naomi and Giuseppe recommend  the italian wine AUTOCTONI. i can't recommend you enough this experience. Thanks and well done Naomi and Giuseppe. I am looking forward to visiting you in 2022.
March 2022,CAN'T WAIT TO RETURN,"My wife and I were fortunate to spend a night at The Hari last week. What a brilliant place to stay in London.  The welcome at reception was so very friendly, the room was very good, the evening meal and breakfast were superb and the service throughout the hotel was brilliant. Thanks to all the great staff at The Hari."
March 2022,Great luxury customer journey through out,"Visited the Hari at their bar&lounge on a Monday evening. Definitely the best Monday blue remedy. The warm ambience can only be described as parallel to Hari's service. The manager, Sante, was a delightful character. He had the right balance of friendliness and efficiency and was personable, so were the other staff members, they made sure that we had everything we needed. The entire customer journey was just perfect; from the moment you enter the door to the moment you leave and be left with a warm-hearted smile. I can't think of a better way to end our night."
March 2022,Impeccable service,"I just recently had the pleasure of experiencing The Hari for the first time,  and my stay here was first class. The highlights for me were the exemplary service, Alex in particular (one of the managers)  was a real gem and a credit to The Hari, and also the food was outstanding.  Would recommend 100%"
March 2022,Beautiful experience,"Had the best 10 years anniversary with my boyfriend, the Hari is a place to be in Belgravia, the staff was very caring especially Alex who Made us feel special. Thank you to all we will return. Thank you to all , we will return for another amazing experience."
March 2022,Superb in every detail,"It becomes clear quite quickly that a lot of thought was put into this hotel. Everything's works well. It has a "" relaxed-chic"" vibe - it feels so more authentic than other of the other 5 star hotels in London! Check in was quick and friendly, concierge was extremely efficient. The room has comfortable beds, quality towels, blackout blinds. But the bar ( oh, the Bar), is where it really stands out! A nice ambiance, a very skilled bar and Marta! Marta made us feel extremely welcome, always there to help with a big friendly smile. We had a drink at the hotel and headed out to the Bar at the Connaught only to come back running to the Hari. It felt like were coming back home. The bar closes at 1 and we staying until 3 with a supply of drinks and having a great time. Thanks again…"
March 2022,The coffee,"The place was very nice and the staff were kind and lovely  their coffee is amazing, there was an employee named Marta she’s lovely and amazing person. That Coffee will be my best place and coffee in world not just in London"
March 2022,"Beautiful dinner at ""Il Pampero""","We arrived with my friend early evening for a cocktail at the Hari Bar. It was quiet but service was impeccable. They are really attentive and definitely know what to recommend.   Cocktails were nicely presented, very-well balanced and really good as well. We then continued our evening at ""Il Pampero"". We both took a pasta dish to start. I highly recommend the ""Tortello Ripieno di Carbonara"". It was absolutely delicious !!! As a main course, my friend had the Monkfish and I tried the tagliata, both of them amazing. As a whole, the service was really with a special attention to details, very smiley staff which just brings the experience to a whole new level ! Very happy and would definitely come back!"
February 2022,Fabulous & friendly ,"I had such a fabulous stay. The rooms are beautiful, spacious and comfortable & the staff so welcoming and friendly. My new favourite hotel in London. Great bar serving delicious food and cocktails. The perfect end to a long day working or shopping. "
February 2022,"Beautiful room, great staff!",My wife and I stayed at the Hari with our 8 month old baby over the weekend and loved our stay. From the moment we checked in the staff were incredibly friendly and very helpful with setting up the cot in the room ahead of time and making our stay very comfortable. The room service was delicious and arrived quickly. The bed was far more comfortable than any I’ve had in other London hotels. Our daughter used the massive bath like a swimming pool. Breakfast arrived as expected with fresh juice and French press coffees.   The only thing I didn’t like was that we had to leave so soon. I can’t wait to stay at the Hari again!
February 2022,Great Place,"I had a couple of long business days and to avoid the commute stayed up in town. Couldn’t ask for a better place to stay. Very convenient central London location, efficient and friendly staff and a very comfortable bed. Special thanks to Charlie in reservations for organising the booking and to Fernando for such perfect breakfast service."
February 2022,Good Times,We enjoyed another wonderful stay at The Hari to celebrate my husband’s birthday. Many thanks to Sabrine and Bruno for such an easy check-in and also to Juan and Naomi for making our evening at the bar so enjoyable. We also very much appreciated the delicious birthday  chocolate pastry treat.
February 2022,That's amore,"We had an amazing dinner at “Il Pampero” for S.Valentine day. Everything was perfect, the set menu was fabulous!  A special thank you to Naomi and Giuseppe that makes our night even more special, they took care of all the small details to make our night unforgettable.

Thank you Sabrine for you support. Also they have amazing concierge Diego and Ricardo they are the best they willing too help as much as they can, also Sami he is the best he allows requested the taxi for us when he see us at the mine lobby, many thanks.

February 2022,Art Cocktails,I came few weeks ago to try the new art cocktails from the cocktails list. Giuseppe explained to us all the ingredients and the stories behind. My favourite was the one inspired by Botticelli. Also thank you to Vittorio who look after us during our staying. Definitely I will come back soon.
February 2022,Eccellente,We have been at The Hari Terrace recently and we had a special time. the venue was fantastic and the drinks/wine's menu even better! Thank you to Marta and Vittorio to make sure that everything was on point. Juan and Victor at the bar let us try their amazing signature cocktails.

February 2022,5 star experience at The Hari Hotel  ,"My recent stay at the Hari Hotel was truly excellent. It was my first time back in London in two years due to Covid-19 & I was nervous about visiting the city. However, the hotel made me feel right at home, the staff were very friendly and the hotel was very clean. It was a truly luxurious stay and I will definitely visit and stay at The Hari hotel with my family next time I am visiting London. Dónal    "
February 2022, It exceeded my expectations. ,"The staff is amazing, rooms are super comfortable, the bar is cute, the overall experience was positively surprising! The location is superb, and even though it is touristic, it feels authentic London! It exceeded my expectations. "
December 2021,Amazing,"I had an amazing time at the Hari. Marta the manager was amazing , can’t wait to come back again . Design of the hotel is incredible.  . Atmosphere was great . Thank you to all the team great hospitality"
December 2021,Exceeded expectations!,"This was our second visit and I’m so glad we came back! We had a couple of small issues during the first visit however the manager at the time took all our feedback and we re arranged to come back. Excellent warm welcome from reception and the hotel has a lovely scent when you step in to the lobby. We had room 703 and would definitely recommend the suites, they are spacious and our room was a corner room with great views out over London. We also received a surprise of chocolate and bubbles in the room which was much appreciated. A hand written note welcoming us back, all the small things really make you feel welcome. We didn’t get a chance to stop by the bar this time which was a shame but I highly recommend you do this as drinks were really great last time and service to match.…"
December 2021,Great hotel and location,"Very nice property and attentive staff. I particularly appreciated the black out electric shade, haven't slept so late in years. Also great location. Not the crazy London tourist feel but only a few blocks from excellent retail, would definitely return."
December 2021,Great hotel for a London break,"From the minute you enter, the hotel staff can’t do enough for you. We visited as a family and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The location is great for shopping and local eateries. The bar at the hotel had a great atmosphere.  Overall the hotel has a personal feel and a gem of a find…"
December 2021,It was HARI-mazzzing !,"I went to the Hari a few times and I can tell that I have never found a place as good as this. Everything was great ! The entire staff was amazing and made me feel so welcome. If you are looking for an exceptional experience where each detail is tailored made for you. Just book it as I cannot wait to return. Yes, it has become my home away from home.   Thank you to the staff, especially to John who I had a pleasure to meet."
December 2021,The place to stay above any other in London.,"When the world is volatile and verging on crazy, the Hari provides a tranquil, beautiful, safe and home like setting in the middle of Belgravia. Recently stayed at the Hari and everything was perfect! The room, lounge bar, terrace and gym were all great - I’d recommend this place above any hotel in a London!"
December 2021,Wonderful hotel and people,"We spent a long holiday weekend in London at The Hari. The hotel property, inside and out, is beautiful and exactly as advertised. The Hari Suite room we had was comfortable, super clean, lovely. What impressed us most was the people at the hotel … totally helpful, friendly, nice, available from the first exchange at the check in desk to our checkout. We loved it here and would definitely stay here in any future trip to London. "
December 2021,Awesome!,"Really loved the bar, and the environment. The decoration was really nice! If someone could experience I would recommend to enjoy at least one of the many cocktails! 😁 Couldn't had been attended better, the staff (if I didn't forgot the names: Marta, Naomi, Ariana and Sandra) that served us was very attentive and funny! Great experience!"
December 2021,Thank you so much,"Andrew, Aleks, Matt and of course the rest of the team, thank you so very much for taking care of us...again! Nothing is off the table with this crew in regards to the hospitality we received. My vocabulary runs out of superlatives in how best to describe this hotel........"
December 2021,Amazing,"Amazing experience, really nice selection of spirits, the staff was execellent. We want to thanks Marta for the professional service provided! We are looking forward to be back at the harri!  So lovely atmosphere!"
November 2021,"Perfect location, amazing staff!","We had a lovely time at the Hari. Alex took great care of us and the staff is overall really friendly and attentive. The cocktails are mind-blowing and Vittorio at the bar was lovely to talk to.  Great experience altogether, we'll be back for sure!"
October 2021,Went the xtra mile…,First Class property with awesome staff! Stayed 3 nights in London. Nice and clean room. All preferences in place. Truly enjoyed our stay! Ben and Diego from Concierge made our stay efficient and were taking extra care of us-superb service on all levels! I forgot my Sonos in the room. Promptly found I requested to send along with few items from Harrods which was delivered today! Gone the xtra mile!!! Mille Grazie! Extraclass-thank you all and especially Diego!! Will return.
September 2021,Great location. Great service,"The location of The Hari is fantastic and away from the hustle and bustle of London and in the village atmosphere of Belgravia, it’s restaurants, cafes and boutiques…but only a few streets from London’s main roads. The staff were really helpful and the doormen were great and very helpful in getting taxis. Well worth staying and we will be back someday."
November 2021,Friendly,"Booked one night with my son for a 21st birthday shopping trip.  The hotel very kindly left a bottle of champagne, a card and a cake in our room which was a lovely touch.  The door/reception staff were all friendly and helpful.  Few negatives - no bath, no heated rails or anywhere to hang towels other than in the toilet which is where they were put, is that hygienic?  Our TV didn't work at all despite lengthy attempts by a porter and we had a poor experience at the bar.  But....  The location is fantastic, the room was comfortable, clean and quiet (some other guest disturbance but nothing major) and having the car valet parked was useful.  Would definitely return."
September 2021,Fabulous stay for our anniversary,"The most special stay for our anniversary! The Hari is magical in all ways, the staff are so friendly and helpful, the atmosphere is both luxuriously calm but also really lively. I couldn't recommend a stay at The Hari more. From the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out it was complete bliss. We will definitely be staying again - as soon as possible!"
November 2021,Exceptional Hotel,"The Hari is a wonderful hotel located in  Belgravia. The area is gorgeous and perfect for walking and wandering around. The Hotel is exceptional, however what makes it stand out are the staff who really go above and beyond. It is walking distance to shopping, wonderful restaurants, and a couple of tube stations. It is easy to get to all the major sites. Traveling from the USA is a little challenging with all the Covid requirements that seem to keep changing….however, Diego was so helpful and made navigating this very easy!! We will definitely be back, and you should not miss out on this gem of a hotel!!"
October 2021,"Beautiful rooms, accommodating staff",This was the nicest hotel we've stayed at in London.  Beautiful spacious room.  All the staff were very friendly and eager to help.  It made traveling during these crazy covid times a bit easier!  And just a 10 minute walk to Harrods!
October 2021,The Hari Hotel,"Absolutely an outstanding hotel!!!  I cannot recommend this hotel enough; Location, staff, food are all simply wonderful!  If you plan on going to London your stay should be at the Hari Hotel!!!  We would like to say a huge thank you to all the staff that ensured we had a 5 star stay and made our vacation even better than we could have imagined!!!  Don Caron Canada"
October 2021,Another Perfect Stay,"Flawless service from exiting the cab to checking out. Friendly, helpful staff. We had a complimentary upgrade to a suite which was a really lovely surprise and much appreciated. Beautiful room and a bottle of chilled welcoming Champagne. Bed very comfy. All that was missing was snacks and chocolate in the mini bar but Waitrose is around the corner!"
October 2021,Even better post-pandemic!,"I have not been back to the Hari since the pandemic, and I was delighted to find it even better than my memory of this always first-rate boutique hotel.  The staff were not just friendly and accommodating, but genuinely seemed delighted to be there in their various roles, from front desk to bar service, to delivering drinks to the room.  I had several large meetings to attend by video, so pushed hard on the house internet without any difficulty.  The room was super comfortable, but it was the staff that made the visit exceptional."
October 2021,Best of the best,Noone quite does it like the staff at the Hari. Every detail from the minute you book is well thought through and personalised to your experience. I would never stay anywhere else in London and can only hope they continue to expand their hotel portfolio. Everyone goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome and not enough can be said about the attention to detail. Highly recommend to anyone and everyone. My favourite hotel for a truly luxury experience.
October 2021,Fantestic,"For me the best hotel in London, only a brief stay this time but felt very welcome, lovely spacious room. Helpful friendly staff especially Matt who greeted me in reception. Perfect, looking forward to our next visit."
October 2021,Best Bartender Ever,Pepe and Juan and Louise are the best ! Best cocktails and service ! Ever ! I feel like they are family! And More💜 I felt very welcomed in The hari everytime I see them ! They always smile ! ALWAYS ! Even on the worst days
October 2021,Amazing! 5 star and Dog Friendly!,"Thank you for an amazing stay! Firstly, the hotel is stunning and you really have thought about every detail. All of the staff were so attentive, professional and could not do enough for us to ensure we had a super stay. We were so impressed with the service provided to our two small dogs. The staff are so welcoming and the hotel has everything a dog could need and more! They loved their doggy treats! We have never experienced such a wonderful dog friendly hotel, thank you! Thank you so much! We will definitely be back!"
October 2021,A touch of Luxury,"Very attenuative staff and looked after from the front door in and out.  Beautiful rooms, comfy bed and fantastic shower. London Belgravia perfect base. Great choice of Drinks and Cocktails Lovely breakfast. "
October 2021,A chilled weekend,"WE had a postponed weekend at The Hari , we just needed to chill . And bot did we . From the moment we arrived we had ""just the right amount ' of service , we were helps and assisted but not bothered , all the team at The Hari seem to instinctively know when we needed help. All the team were brilliant. Thank YOU"
September 2021,"Excellent service, comfortable and stylish room","The staff at the Hari went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed, including advising on covid testing and making us comfortable when we arrived before our room was ready. The Hari is smaller than some other top London hotels but I find that an asset and would compare it favorably with them."
October 2021,Fantastic week-end,"A hidden gem in the middle of very in a very exclusive area .  From the moment you arrive at the Hari you are made to feel very welcome. The location is great, close to Buckingham palace, and also 3 tube station, within 10 minutes  walk,  giving it great access to the rest of London. The bedroom was sparkling clean with some lovely finishing touches . Can't wait for a return visit. A credit to all the staff."
October 2021,Amazing,"I had a great time at the hari , Marta and vittorio were very welcoming. Amazing drinks . And a cool vibe  All the staff are very welcoming and nice , had a greasy evening in the bar and restaurant . Highly recommend"
October 2021,Hooray for the Hari!,"A wonderful welcome by the receptionist, assistance by the Porter and even the maintenance team, who cut through the padlock on our suitcase as we’d miss-placed our key, made our initial impression one of outstanding hospitality.  The room was extremely well furnished, with all the expected high end touches for a hotel in Belgravia. A minor inconvenience were the bedroom doors closing mechanism which did not dampen the door from hitting the jamb; so irregular noise as adjoining rooms closed their doors.  The post booking and pre-arrival emails were the best digital marketing we have experienced; with numerous suggestions as to how we could enjoy our stay."
November 2021,Extremely pleasant,"A great experience with a great host, with an extremely pleasant yet pleasant staff from entry until you’re at your room. First time at the hotel and surely and hopefully will not be the last as The Hari will be the first hotel to be on the list for future visits to London."
November 2021,A Precious Jewel!,"What an amazing gem of a place to call home for a few days! Our first experience in London straight from Heathrow at 7:00 AM on a Sunday morning, greeted by a full staff ready to exceed every expectation. Marzia and Richardo, and the door men who greeted us, where the first in a line of professionals who met our every need and answered all our questions.  The surprise treats in the room, perfect dining recommendations, and the lovely craft cocktails at the bar made us feel like VIPs for four days. We cannot express enough gratitude for making 35 wedding anniversary like our honeymoon ❤ ♥.  Thank you all, we will return!"
November 2021,Great staff and service,"Very happy with my weekend at ""The Hari"". As expected, the service was impeccable, and the staff did a great job to make the stay as good as it could be. Our room was very small but was surprisingly well equipped. Amazing what and how they have managed to squeeze everything in 😊  The bed was great, and the room (and hotel) was very clean.  So why not 5 stars? Well – the hotel is not cheap, and for me there was no upside surprises. I had booked two rooms and asked for room(s) on higher floors, which I did not get. 4th and 5th floors do not really give you any view to speak of. You need at least 6th floor to get a view. The Hari is a solid choice, and I would not hesitate to recommend the hotel do anyone who does not have to worry about the price."
November 2021,Luxurious Anniversary Weekend,"My partner and I could not have picked a more stunning, welcoming and luxurious stay to celebrate our 5th anniversary in the heart of Belgravia.  Right from the moment we entered through the hotel doors, we were treated like royalty. What really stood out for me was the incredibly friendly atmosphere that every staff member transmitted. Particular mentions on arrival go to Diego and Matt who made us feel comfortable straight away.  Across the weekend we spent at the Hari, we had the pleasure of enjoying both an evening meal and a sumptuous brunch in the hotel’s ‘Il Pampero’ Italian restaurant. Aside from the amazing food, the people stood out once again as they were knowledgeable, attentive and welcoming. We were looked after especially well by Naomi, Pablo, Sante and Marta…"
November 2021,one night,"We have just stayed at the amazing Hari for one night, staff hotel and food were incredible, from arrival to checkout nothing was to much trouble for the proffesional staff. Highly recommend the Hari to anyone wanting a fantastic hotel"
November 2021,Excellent hotel,Had a really great stay with top tier service. Staff made check in smooth and kept the room clean and welcoming each day. They work hard to go above and beyond to make your stay as comfortable as possible. I look forward to returning.
October 2021,Amazing staff,I really like the place the stuff is so kind and the food was amazing and really great atmosphere  thank you so much to Marta  Vittorio and giuseppe   they make our time wonderful  cannot wait to came back again
November 2021,Better this time,Great stay at The Hari second time around. Had a quieter room at the end of the corridor. The Hari staff are an excellent team and nothing appears to be too much trouble. There is a lovely vibe / relaxed feeling in the hotel and I would highly recommend.  
November 2021,Weekend Treat,"We enjoyed another wonderful weekend break at this lovely hotel which I cannot recommend more highly.  Always a pleasure to stay and enjoy such warm hospitality. The bar and terrace, as always, were great places to relax and the room exquisitely comfortable.  We look forward to coming back soon."
November 2021,Fabulous customer service,"Had a night at Hari last week for my husbands birthday, I would like to thank all the staff (especially Charlie Brown) who really went to huge effort to make it a perfect stay, from bubbles and a birthday cake in the room (courtesy of the hotel) to complimentary cocktails and dessert at dinner. The room was lovely and I simply cannot fault the staff. Highly recommended"
September 2021,Wonderful hotel,"Our daughters organised an overnight stay with breakfast as a surprise 50th Wedding Anniversary present. The hotel was amazing, and all the staff attentive and helpful. We had a lovely large room on the 6th floor , exceptionally clean , super comfortable bed and pillows and we  were really surprised when a chilled bottle of wine and yummy chocolates were delivered to our room courtesy of the management. .Thank you so much !  The reception staff were exceptionally helpful when we had a problem in the restaurant with our breakfast. (See separate review). They dealt with this immediately and professionally."
September 2021,Gem of a hotel!,"We had booked tickets for the Chelsea Flower Show and decided to make a weekend of it and booked The Hari for a couple of nights. Great location - away from all the hustle and bustle, but just a few minutes walk away from Chelsea and Knightsbridge. Hotel definitely has a boutique feel about it - stylishly furnished. Super classy but understated. The rooms are great - views from the 10th floor are superb! Restaurant and bar are great (try the bottomless brunch!) However it is definitely the staff that make this hotel memorable - nothing it too much trouble and everyone is so friendly, taking time to chat and ask about your day. This hotel is a must!"
September 2021,"Happy to be home at The Hari, again","So happy to have been back - if only for one night this time. Because The Hari is our  home away from home, it feels especially good to arrive even when it is only for one night. thank so much for your lovely 'small' greetings, and the perfect atmosphere. See you soon.❤️"
September 2021,Well deserved title holder of UKs No 1 hotel,"Excellent hotel with the friendliest staff mad e for a very pleasant 4 nights.  Good location for walking round Chelsea, Knightsbridge and Belgravia.   Had breakfast in the hotel couple of times which was very nice (no menu available online but good range of choices at reasonable price).  Also dined one evening and the flavours were exquisite! Would definitely recommend this hotel"
September 2021,The hari hotel London,"Had an amazing time as usual  Staff all looked after me and my family amazingly well  Rooms fantastic , clean and good sizes and decor great  Best Location for shopping , sight seeing and good restaurants nearby  All round best hotel in London!!!"
September 2021,Exceptional,"Myself, my colleagues, and some client guests stayed at The Hari on Wednesday 15th September - a group booking of around 20 - all efficiently handled by the Executive Assistant and Reservations Manager Charlie Brown. It was the most exceptional level of customer service I’ve experienced in a long time.   Our group was supremely impressed by the hotel itself, the staff and the thoughtful details the staff - led by Charlie - put in to make our stay both pleasurable and memorable.   We were all blown away by what Charlie had arranged with the pastry chef as she knew the reason for our stay and went the extra mile to leave us all the most delicious and thoughtful edible keepsakes in our rooms. Our clients were most impressed.   We’ve already agreed to book again next year for the…"
September 2021,Best hotel experience of my life,"When I say this hotel is the best hotel I’ve ever stayed in, I mean it. Apart from the stunning terrace, restaurant and bedrooms, the staff that go above and beyond is really what makes this hotel so special. We received an upgrade on arrival and spoke about our plans for the weekend in London as well as poffertjes (it’ll make sense soon).  When we got into the room, we were offered 2 cocktails on the house and shortly after that, received a bottle of champagne along with a personalised cake with my favourite bands logo on it who we were going to see in the o2 that night- completely wowed!  The next morning we ordered breakfast to the room and 3 dishes arrived. You guessed it, the 3rd dish contained poffertjes and a little note to say how we couldn’t leave without trying them. …"
July 2021,Thnayyan Hasan,"The Hari Hotel is the best in London. Great staff, friendly environment, and cozy atmosphere.. Best option to release your stressful working days or for your vacation. And I’m thankful for everyone there."
September 2021,Lovely boutique hotel,"Nice boutique hotel good location friendly staff.  Pricey but given the area expected. Lovely courtyard bar, good breakfast and bar snacks. Rooms are very comfortable with all the usual treats. We would stay here again although the promised bottle of fizz by the booking agent never materialised."
September 2021,Fantastic hotel with great staff,"We stayed here for two nights. The location is great. You are close to some great bars, restaurants and shopping. The rooms are nicely decorated. However the best part of the hotel are the staff. The staff were friendly, extremely helpful and professional. We will definitely stay here again."
August 2021,Great escape away from the hustle and bustle,"We stayed for our wedding anniversary and this place was just fantastic in a fantastic part of the city. We were upgraded which was a touch. The staff, rooms, amenities are all top class. Ok it doesn’t have an on-site carpark but 6 minutes walk away is Q-park which was £55 for 24 hours, but the car is safe and secure and rubbing shoulders with some expensive metal. But overall great place, great location and worth the money "
August 2021,It's ok,"Good location, lovely staff but our room was a little tired looking. Cleaning was ok but for the price I would think it would be absolutely spotless. It's London so I expect limescale but could see it on shower door, stains on chair and tired looking rug which I dared not step on with bare feet.   Lovely terrace bar and lovely staff however. "
July 2021,Great stay and service,Stayed for two nights and had a wonderful stay. Location of the hotel is ideal. Amazing service and were happy to accommodate any request. Will be returning to The Hari in the future ad look forward to it
August 2021,BEST HOTEL!!,"All the staff at The Hari are welcoming, happy and friendly. Greeted us with big smiles and made us feel special.  Our room was spacious and clean. House keeping was spot on.  Room service was amazing and assistance was always immediate.  The food at The Hari was delicious and made to perfection.  The lobby, restaurant and bar area were comfortable and it was a chilled environment.  Definitely we will be visiting again. In fact, probably won’t go to any other hotel. Honestly The Hari is THE BEST"
August 2021,I wouldn’t stay anywhere else!,"Having spent two nights at The Hari on the weekend of my wedding, I’m not sure I’d ever look at any other hotel in London.  The hotel is cool, quirky, in an absolutely brilliant location, has the friendliest staff of any hotel I’ve ever stayed at, and feels 100% premium throughout. In particular, Ben and Diego on the concierge team were so helpful to me and my parents ahead of and during our stay.  There’s clearly been a lot of thought and care put into the design of the hotel, from the slick lobby area to the colourful and inviting lounge on the mezzanine level, right through to the selection of art books throughout the hotel.  We stayed in a suite on the 7th floor. The room was very spacious with a great bath surrounded by windows, making you feel completely open to taking in…"
August 2021,outstanding,"If I had to describe my experience at tha Hari in one word it would be outstanding, the staff are so amazing, helpful and always at your disposal. Upon arrival we met Renata and she was absolutely fantastic! Then we went to our room and I have no words to describe how nice it was,they prepare for us a nice plate with little chocolate and a lovely card from the reception were they welcoming us at the Hari,then we went to the bar on the first floor and we meet Vittorio ready to welcome us he show us the garden terrace and we had a lovely dinner there with our waiter Alessio with a nice bottle of Italian wine recommend from Vittorio!! The next day we had a great breakfast at pampero with Juan who made us the best latte ever !! After checking out Alex and Dominique there were ready…"
August 2021,Memorable Experience,"Very charming boutique hotel in the heart of London. Excellent walking proximity to Harrods, Knightsbridge, and Sloane Square. Very accommodating and friendly staff throughout hotel. Rooms are definitely on the smaller side but still comfortable enough. Very nice terrace restaurant and upstairs bar lounge to end your day with a nice drink and snacks.  I had a bit of an issue throughout my long stay and the Operations Director, Alex as well as the GM, Andrew were immediately hands on and ensured to further accommodate my needs and have me enjoy the rest of my stay. This is the type of management that makes a huge difference in hospitality and creates a memorable experience for the guest. Had a very lovely stay and will certainly come back again! I Highly recommend this hotel for…"
August 2021,Perfection ……,"We enjoyed another weekend break at The Hari. It is always a pleasure to go back with its relaxed feel, super comfortable rooms and friendly staff. It is always a stress free check-in with Sabine at reception and Ricardo on concierge and Luis always makes it very easy to enjoy Friday nights in the bar. Not forgetting of course Fernandez who serves the best breakfast.! We’ll be back soon."
August 2021,"Classy 5 Star Hotel in the best part of London. Perfect for a business trip, London holiday or Intimate Corporate event","Had a lovely stay at The Hari London. Wonderful, helpful team and great location. Classy lounge / bar area with beautiful decor and friendly, attentive staff. A must visit for the garden terrace, perfect for a balmy summer evening and a cocktail. Will definitely be back to enjoy the food at the restaurant. Perfect location for a corporate event now that London is back in business."
August 2021,The New Standard,"After retiring from 40 years in hospitality, I know get to write my first review and it pleases me no end that this review should be glowing. I have had the very good fortune to travel to many corners of the world and to many 5 star hotels. However, the main issue that I have encountered is that at 5 star standard the experience can be diluted by overtraining or the size of the venue and subsequently the outcome can become clinical and lack personality. Not here. With the backdrop of Covid and the subsequent fallout in the hospitality sector, trying to maintain a standard must be near impossible but somehow The Hari are managing this just fine. From the second the doors opened, till the second they closed behind us I have never encountered such personality, hospitality and care.…"
August 2021,Outstanding service and amazing room!!,"This is such an amazing place to stay!!! I was looking for a nice and quiet place to stay in London and we decided to stay here and this was the perfect choise ,the room was pwrfect ,clean spacious they also give us some chocolate to welcoming us to the hotel and the bathroom was outstanding ,we enjoyed so much our time there. During our stay we went to il pampero, a fancy Italian restaurant,on the door we meet Marta the manager she welcoming us and we wanted a drink before the dinner so she shows us the bar where the amazing Peppe prepared for us the Peppe’s spritz and a champagne cocktail “what an amazing aperitif!!” .Then our lovely waitress Naomi shows us the best table in the restaurant and she suggest us the lobster ravioli and the carbonara and they were fabulous creamy…"
August 2021,Birthday celebrations at a wonderful hotel,"From the moment we walked in to the moment we left, the staff at The Hari were first class. Alex and Dominick in particular were an absolute delight and made our experience at the hotel an incredibly enjoyable one.  Firstly, it's very COVID-safe. Plenty of sanitising stations.   The hotel itself is very boujee and boutique in character but in a lovely rather than pretentious way. The terrace bar is a pretty setting for casual drinks / nibbles and the bar area is a very laid-back speakeasy vibe, which was very enjoyable. The barman (forgot his name apologies!) was very attentive and even brought us a selection of rum tasters given how much I like it.  The rooms are very spacious and comfortable, and because it was a special celebration, the hotel left some treats (both alcoholic…"
September 2021,Wedding anniversary celebration,Just spent our Anniversary at the Hari and could not have been more impressed  From the moment we arrived to the moment of check out it was truly amazing  The staff went that extra mile to make our stay special with complimentary fizz and upgrade  I am planning my next visit already as a Christmas pressie to myself and my daughter   Well done Hari team and thank you   Sharon
September 2021,Enjoyable visit but not sure it lives up to the hype,If you read the other reviews it is entirely right that The Hari receives a range of praise and accolades but can I say it knocked me off my feet? Probably not.   The rooms (suite) and bar area were nice enough and the service is very good but I can’t say it’s the most interesting of places to spend time in or particularly memorable. Breakfast was good.
September 2021,Wonderful Hotel Experience,We visited the Hari for our wedding.  From the moment we arrived the staff made us feel super welcome and were constantly looking for little details that would make our stay even more lovely.  The hotel itself is very well presented with an eclectic decor done to a very good standard.  The breakfasts in particular were fantastic.  We loved every minute of our time at the Hari and will be returning!
September 2021,Amazing bottomless brunch,"Amazing brunch and atmosphere, Vito was amazing in looking after us and the whole team is just so attentive. They even have amazing gluten free pasta, I had the clams spaghetti and the vitello tonnato, but the  tiramisu is to die for, too bad is quite small as I would have gladly ordered another one. Loved the live music too."
September 2021,Such an amazing time!,"I came to to the restaurant Il pampero to try the new brunch with a friend and I have to say that it’s one of the best experience I’ve had! The food and the offering is great, a lot to choose from wether you want a traditional dish or go for oysters or one of the Italian speciality. On top of that they offer options for bottomless and I must say the quality of the drinks is also 5 stars ⭐️!  The team who I knew from before was as always amazing, especially Sante, Vittorio and Nando!  Congratulations to the GM who is leading these amazing people!!  Can’t wait to be back!!!"
September 2021,Amazing experience,"Had an amazing experience at the restaurant  today with a friend. We didn’t book and walked in and were so warmly welcomed from the door to the restaurant staff that we decided to have lunch. The food, drinks and service was just spot on! The atmosphere made us travel away from London’s busy streets. I will definitely recommend and go back. Can’t wait to visit again. Thank you to Nando and Alex and the rest of the team who were exceptional."
August 2021,Amazing!,"Beautiful, spacious room with top-class amenities, perfect for relaxing in the evening. Outstanding breakfast with friendly service and delicious pancakes! Staff were very accommodating and went above and beyond to deliver a top-quality service. Would definitely love to stay here again and would highly recommend."
August 2021,"Friendly staff,fantastic service with that personal touch","lovely quiet location. Beautiful hotel with spacious rooms including great amenities and a really comfortable bed.Staff were very pleasant and accommodating,always a smile. We as a family stayed at this hotel as we were going to be visiting  Warner Brother Studio tour. On our arrival to the hotel room we were greeted with a tray of beautiful individually designed chocolates surrounding the Harry Potter Crest, this was such a very impressive personal touch !! and my daughters were thrilled,this showed they cared. A stay to remember,highly recommended."
July 2021,Lockdown Escape,Great to get away for a couple of days and The Hari proved to be an excellent choice.  Located in my favorite part of London and a short walk from amenities and the tube.  We were very well looked after.
July 2021,Luxurious retreat in fantastic location,"We had a fab 2 night stay in this lovely hotel.  The staff are eager to help, full of smiles, offering excellent service at all times.  As soon as you step into the super stylish entrance, an amazing aroma hits you, adding to the welcoming ambiance. The rooms are very well appointed, with super comfortable beds and linens, a an espresso machine and all mod cons. The location is perfect for fabulous shopping, top end restaurants and exploring the beautiful architecture in the immediate vicinity All in all, highly recommended"
June 2021,Premium Service Delivery,"I had a fantastic time at the Hari. One lady stood out to us. Her name is Binta. She is the kindest and most professional staff we met. She was very knowledgeable, she was prompt, friendly and supportive with helpful ideas. I will return to the Hari because of the lovely time and impression we had.   Welldone Guys!"
June 2021,Birthday weekend,"We have just returned from a weekend in London to celebrate my Birthday and chose to stay at The Hari following the fantastic reviews we read online.   The Hari is a beautiful boutique hotel situated in a the stunning area of Belgravia, a 7 minute walk from Knightsbridge tube which is really handy.   Upon arrival we were greeted by the concierge who couldn’t have been more friendly and helpful, asking about our weekend and asking if we were celebrating an occasion. I mentioned it was my birthday and usually when I’ve stayed in other 5* hotels we would usually expect to be offered a celebratory drink, but not at this hotel. The couple in front who were celebrating an anniversary were however offered a drink and a room that was ready early for them, we were however greeted by a…"
July 2021,"A must stay! Excellent staff, service, food, and neighbourhood.","Came to have a staycation this past weekend, and celebrate my birthday. The neighbourhood: Knightsbridge / Belgravia is really quiet and lovely with tons of incredible shopping and food. Easy to walk anywhere you'd like to go. The hotel: The staff was amazing! They surprised me with the most incredible cake and cocktails when I arrived. They were also always there for a lovely conversation or to help in any way they could. Exceptional staff and service. Room service: During our stay, we ordered room service multiple times and the food was great - especially loved the Korean fried chicken and the chicken gyoza. They also have excellent cocktails. The room: Our room (King Premium) was lovely. It had the nicest sofa by the window, which was nice to read in and watch the city. The…"
July 2021,Our New Home in London,"We had not visited London for over a year and decided with the relaxation of Covid regulations that now would be a good time to visit. We were not wrong on many fronts but our choice of a new hotel to stay at was our best decision.We arrived,by car,to be greeted as though we were long lost friends. Suitcases were whisked away and we were shown to reception who had all our details and didn't  have to go through the annoying procedure that sometimes happens whereby you ask where the details you used to book have disappeared to? Shown to our room which was a Studio King and it was excellent.Lots of space and a fabulous bathroom -with a view!.The blackout blinds in the bedroom were perfect for somebody who likes a dark room to sleep in. Housekeeping happened like magic and every…"
June 2021,Our place in Belgravia,"This is our favourite hotel in London. Great location just off Belgravia Square. Good size rooms with all the amenities you could want, nice bar, smart restaurant and excellent staff. If we are in London we are at The Hari."
July 2021,PURE EFFORTLESS LUXURY,"We stayed at The Hari as going to Wimbledon.  Every aspect of the hotel was first class.  The location is great just a short walk from Sloane Square, and surprisingly very quiet allowing for a great nights sleep.  Every little detail had been well thought out, from the bikes to the art to the books.  The service was excellent, nothing too much trouble.  We left feeling feeling very special.  Definitely my favourite hotel in London."
July 2021,Birthday celebration,"We had 2 rooms for 2 nights and from moment we arrived to leaving were made to feel welcomed by ever member of staff , they are all a credit to this wonderful hotel and can’t wait to return , thanks again"
July 2021,Elegant dinner and very well looked after,"I went to Il Pampero - the Italian restaurant inside the hotel - for a fancy dinner with a friend to celebrate a work success. We were given a welcome cocktail made with Recioto which tasted like heaven. I ordered the Tiramisu starter which was delicious, then a lovely octopus with fennels, both well presented and with flavours well paired. We were constantly looked after by the lovely Sante, Matteo the chef came to say hi and so did the beverage manager, who suggested us what wine to pair with our dinner. Lovely!!!"
October 2020,Fab ,"Having stayed in September we decided to come back and we were so glad we did  Absolutely love this hotel staff rooms etc all outstanding, having stayed all over the world and never staying in the same place twice, we loved this place so much had to come back  Cannot rate this hotel enough"

October 2020,Just as fantastic as always!,"We have stayed in this hotel before and always loved our stays. We were a little apprehensive staying again during the pandemic, but I'm so glad we came. All the staff are wearing masks and the place is spotless, and the service is just as fantastic as it was before. It's great to see that hasn't changed. Such a great team, and breakfast is fantastic. The beetroot smoked salmon is something I haven't seen before, but highly recommend. We didn't try the curfew cocktails, but they sounded fun. We had lovely, much needed break, and will be back again when we need another change of scenery."
October 2020,Legendary Breakfast,On Saturday 3 rd October 2020 we arrived at The Hari Hotel in London for a weekend treat with my girlfriend in London. As they were sorting out for us the room as we arrived early myself and my partner we had a breakfast in the  main  restaurant dining room  of the hotel. The breakfast itself was delicious but moreover was the  service . We were served by a young ginger waitress her name Naomi she looked us very well throughout the breakfast her service was impeccable and seamless. At the end of breakfast we had a little chat with her and she recommend also which place to visit in London during our stay.

September 2020,THE HARI IS THE PLACE TO DRINK!,"Me and my girlfriend went to the Hari just for a couple of drinks after a long walk in the centre of the city. We were sitted at a (romantic) table just beside the bar counter, the Bartender Giuseppe gave us the best treatment,very professional and great knowledge . He suggests us to try “holiday in paradise” (if I well remember)and we had 2 rounds!so refreshing and spicy, exactly what we wanted. Such a great atmosphere ,surrounded by this modern design mixed to classic but mostly by warm people. Can’t wait to go back as I promise to Giuseppe."

September 2020,Fabulous Place!,"My Husband and I stayed here  on Monday for a business stay and we were more than impressed by this hotel. The staff were amazing! They could not of done more for us in the overnight stay that we had. They were really good with our Car and Luggage, where it was all away waiting for us for when we get back from our meeting to enable us to get straight off to our next appointment.  We unfortunately didn't order any food as we were only there for a short period, however we both enjoyed a glass of wine or two in our suite after a long day.   We would recommend this hotel for anyone looking to book here. We would definitely be adding to our list of stays."

June 2021,Best stay for our wedding night,"Had an absolutely brilliant time at The Hari over the weekend! We stayed our wedding night in the hotel, and also celebrated our big day with friends at the Amalfi Terrace. The room had spectacular views of London, while the terrace had a very cosy and aesthetic vibe. The staff were very helpful and allowed us to stay at the terrace beyond operating hours to celebrate our big day. They really went out of their way to provide amazing service I cannot ask for a better experience. Will definitely be returning back for another fun night 😁"
June 2021,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed at The Hari for my son’s 21st birthday party in London. Even though the party was not in the hotel, they got every detail right, upgraded our rooms and even laid on a birthday cake. Despite having to shut during the lockdown, the owners and management have got the property back into tip top condition. The staff are all charming - doesn’t matter which part of the hotel they work in, they are just friendly, efficient and polite. The rooms are comfortable and bathrooms really well equipped. Overall, I couldn’t recommend this hotel more - it is certainly on par, if not better than some of its higher priced rivals. Thank you The Hari - a really excellent stay."
June 2021,The Hari- elegant and luxurious,"The hotel was glamorous and stylish and the staff were impeccable. Nothing was too much trouble and our stay was comfortable and chic.

June 2021,Boutique hotel in a wonderful location,"One of my favourite hotels in London, the location is excellent especially for warmer days when walking is an option.

June 2021,Stunning hotel and impeccable service..,"My husband and I stayed here recently during a little birthday trip to London.  First of all, the staff were incredibly welcoming and friendly from start to finish. Absolutely everything was perfect. They went above and beyond to make our stay so special. We do normally stay somewhere else but decided to have a change - I'm so glad we did!   The hotel itself is exquisitely designed with a luxurious yet laid back and relaxed style within a great location. The room we stayed in was an absolute dream, beautiful perfectly comfortable and very well equipped.   We had a beautiful meal in the restaurant and again, everything was so perfect. We had eaten at a prestigious restaurant a couple of weeks previously and the food here completely blew that out of the water.  We can't wait to…"
June 2021,New favourite London Hotel,I’ve stayed in many 5 star hotels in London but The Hari is by far the best. The staff are so attentive and nothing is too much trouble for any of them. The location of the hotel is great for shopping. We ate in the hotel restaurant on the Friday evening and both the food and the service were outstanding
June 2021,Fabulous place ,"We had a delightful one-night stay at The Hari. It’s a beautiful boutique hotel located in the confines of Belgravia.  The staff are very friendly and welcoming on arrival, check in was swift and they kindly upgraded us to a better room. It had been a very wet and miserable day-we must have looked like drowned rats on arrival- and we were pleasantly surprised to hear a knock on the door; they had sent up some complimentary hot chocolates for to warm us up. Much appreciated!  The room was very nice, bed comfy. We had drinks on the terrace which was decorated with flowers and chic lighting.  Overall it’s a great hotel and we would definitely return. "
May 2021,A stylish oasis in a beautiful location.,"Stayed at The Hari for one night in May. With hospitality reopening securing good restaurant bookings was incredibly difficult, fortunately the Concierge desk, and Ben in particular absolutely excelled we got great lunch and dinner bookings and were kept appraised at every stage- even being offered options.  Indeed, we were extremely well looked after by the whole team.  The room was beautifully decorated with a light, spacious feel and bright open views on two sides.   The location is perfect for our trip (shopping!) prices are reasonable and the hotel represents extremely good value. Facilities are reopening in spite of the challenges presented by COVID amongst others things.  I can say that the COVID measures in place allow you to enjoy your stay feeling safe and relaxed. The…"
April 2021,Quintessential boutique hotel in the best of London,"Hidden gem in belgravia, lovely staff and intimate bar. Everything you want in a boutique hotel atmosphere. Impeccable service.

May 2021,Superb London Hotel,Best premium Hotel in London. Fabulous facilities but what makes the Hari stand out above the rest is the quality of the staff. Professional but with a genuine human touch. Attentive without being intrusive and great help with all requests large or small.
May 2021,Outstanding Concierge Staff!,"Excellent experience, especially with the assistance I received from the concierge staff.  The Head Concierge, Ben Malpass, and Diego were extremely responsive and helpful on a number of occasions and under special circumstances.  They went way out of their way for me and well above the call of duty.  Rarely will you find a concierge staff as helpful as the team at The Hari.  Very much appreciated!"
May 2021,Stands out from the crowd,"Had an exceptional stay at The Hari.  Whilst I had high expectations from a 5 star hotel my expectations were surpassed.  The staff were exceptional, so friendly and go above and beyond for their guests.  Whilst you would expect this from a 5 star hotel, I was taken aback by the warmth, friendliness and I have to say the sincerity of the staff.  The hotel itself also reflects this with lots of lovely intimate seating areas making it feel warm and  welcoming, but modern and very chic. If you are looking for a truly unique hotel stay for whatever the occasion then you’ve got to try The Hari. Needless to say, I will definitely be coming back."
April 2021,Very welcoming and safe,Booked The Hari for a business trip and was greeted by a exceptionally friendly team who were very accommodating. My highlight was being able to have a few drinks on the heated rooftop terrace whilst. Highly recommend a visit if looking for a hotel in this area or even a few social drinks.
August 2021,WOW...what a gem!!!!,"What an amazing hotel!!! We stayed there 3 nights and I must admit it’s the most fabulous hotel I ever stayed....from beautiful, spacious and very clean rooms to absolutely incredible staff of the hotel. From the moment you walk in you feel very welcome and comfortable...nothing is a hassle...and believe me you don’t want to leave!...would I recommend that hotel?...hellllll yesssss!!!!"
August 2021,Home from home luxury,"We had a 2 night stay at The Hari in August and will definitely return. From the moment we arrived to departure we received 5 star service, the staff were very genuine in their intentions to make our stay as comfortable as possible.   We were met by a lovely chap who opened the taxi door, welcomed us and took our luggage. From that moment on and throughout our stay we felt home from home, nothing was too much trouble.  We booked premium adjoining rooms so our teenagers could have their privacy but also be close by. We closed the doors between us at night; they were happy to stay awake til later and we didn’t have to be disturbed.  The rooms are well equipped with everything you could need, our youngest had forgotten to pack his toothbrush and was able to use the complementary…"
August 2021,Wonderful experience,"Very friendly staff, had a lovely time. Wonderful room had a nice view, and a nice surprise bottle of prosecco too.  Only issues were we had to wait an hour extra for the room and the breakfasts didn't come out at the same time."

August 2021,Big Birthday Weekend,"Chose the Hari for my 50th Birthday weekend in London based on a first class previous stay last year. The Hari has everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel - the location, the design, the cleanliness etc , but what really makes this place special is the staff. Everyone is so friendly and helpful and nothing is ever a problem. That’s what lifts the Hari above other hotels. We can’t wait to return and cannot recommend it highly enough. Stay here - you won’t regret it."
August 2021,Exceptional,"Stayed at the Hari for a special weekend, from the second the doors open the hotel just gets it right. The team throughout were so genuinely friendly and helpful, the room was amazing and really well thought through and the food was excellent. We cant recommend it highly enough. The location is just a few minutes from Knightsbridge and Sloane Square and it is just the most amazing part of London to walk through. Stay at the Hari is all I can say"

July 2021,Best London Hotel Ever!,"We have just returned from this hotel where we stayed for 2 nights. The service and attention to detail was apparent from the outset, nothing was too much trouble. It had a really lovely atmosphere where all the staff appeared to enjoy their job and went out of the way to ensure that our stay was a special one. I can't remember all the staff's names so i apologise if I have missed anyone but special thanks to Dominic for arranging balloons and wine in our room and ensuring our rooms were near each other as we had two rooms. Ben for arranging a luxury transfer to our restaurant, Diego for ensuring that it all went smoothly and Ricardo for his friendly persona and making time each day to ask us how we were and what our plans were.

July 2021,First Class Best Staff in London,"Visited for an overnight stay for a trip to Wimbledon. First greeting at the door by the staff was so warm and genuinely friendly. Easy check in, again staff were lovely. Left our bags so we could hop off to Sloane Square for a direct tube to Southfields. The concierge even gave us a bottle water for the hot tube journey  This hotel is ideally placed for access to Victoria and Sloane Square each about an easy 10 minute walk through beautiful Belgravia.  The area is quiet but you are minutes away from the hustle and bustle  Arrived back at the hotel about 2230 and bags were in our room which was spacious with a lovely window seat looking out onto a leafy square. There was a hand written note welcoming us and some lovely macaroons   Shower room and separate toilet, very nice…"
June 2021,Best cocktail bar,"An amazing cocktail bar in one of the best hotel in London. Special thanks to Naomi that gave me a welcome with a nice table in the terrace, she’s always ready for your request. Giuseppe at the bar, as always, made for me the best negroni that I ever taste, every time… All the staff made me feel home, is always a pleasure. Very recommended"
June 2021,A gem in a prime location in London,My daughter and I stayed in the Hari for 8 nights. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is central and convenient and is very close to Sloane Square and V&A. The room is spacious and clean. The hotel is very well setup for all the Covid measures and it makes us feel very safe. We will definitely go back. 
July 2021,Perfect Stay,"My wife and I stayed at the Hari London this past weekend to celebrate my wifes birthday. From the moment we arrived to the minute we left we were really looked after and treated so well. Each member of staff that we came across had a 5 star customer service level. I had requested a cake and flowers for my wifes birthday, I have to say that the cake was extremely delicious and the flowers were the best she has ever received. Our room was perfect and the Terrace bar was an amazing place to enjoy some pre dinner drinks. Each request we had was catered for without without seconds thought. It's a shame we were only there for the one night but we will definitely be returning for another stay in the near future. Thank you again to the Hari for making us feel so welcome!"
June 2021,Simply the best  ❤️❤️❤️,"Need to start this review off by saying how fussy I usually am.. I go to 5 stars in Mexico and ask to see the honeymoon suite when it’s not even my honeymoon that’s how extreme I am. I’m not easily pleased but what I can say is this hotels staff are EXCEPTIONAL. Nothing , is a problem.   The concierge (forgot his name but he give us a card) has everything under control. He’s fire and completely on the ball. The reception staff are chilled but professional, they don’t make you feel like you are being judged they are really down to earth while doing a great job. Highly professional.   The guys in the bar and restraint, are the same. Neither English but both speak fluent. One wears a white suit jacket and is very smiley the other is just as friendly & helpful but didn’t catch his…"
June 2021,Amazing stay at The Hari,"The staff especially front house were so attentive, helpful and just amazing! Booked in for one night as I was having surgery the next day!

Room was beautiful and state of the art! Will definitely be staying there again!  Highly recommend! "
June 2021,"Just the best! Food, Staff & Stay!","The most amazing stay at the Hari - the staff are super friendly and couldn't do enough for us.

Looking forward visiting again this place which made me feel like home!!!"
October 2020,Fantastic comfy beds,"It’s  nerve wracking staying in a hotel during this pandemic, but we were made to feel extremely secure and pampered at the Hari hotel this weekend.  My sister and I stayed in adjoining rooms 501 and 502, the beds were so comfortable with lightweight duvets and perfect pillows,  once we discovered the TV channels and all the films it was hard to leave the room and the complimentary chilled Soave, but we went to the cocktail bar where we were fortunate to meet Andrew Coney the general manager who was extremely convivial and suggested a couple of cocktails,   I can recommend the  espresso martini, cranberry sour and negroni. we also had of truffle chips, salted squid, tempura vegetables and chicken satay. Then when we got back to our rooms we discovered doughnut balls with salted…"

October 2020,Another 5* stay,We stay at the Hari every time we visit London and each time is as special as the last. The service is incomparable and the staff always go out of their way to make you feel special.

Would highly recommend to anyone wanting to escape in a home away from home.

Thanks to the hari team and see you soon."
October 2020,A slice of paradise!,"Upon arrival we we're greeted and escourted inside. After a breif encounter, myself and my partner headed inside to escape the typical British weather, where we were greeted by drinks arranged prior. Fabulous decor and sense of hospitality by this point was already something i'd had yet to experience, after a decade of living in london! I was sipping my drink and completely forgot about our luggage, lo and behold, the porter had already taken them to our room!   The staff were helpful to say the least, and best of all, genuinely friendly and hospitable.   The room to say it was good would be an understatement, it was great. The views of London from the room we were in was spectacular, and a fridge with some gin topped off the evening.   I cant reccomend a better value, opulent…"
October 2020,A wonderful stay,"My husband and I stayed at The Hari on the 24th October. A wonderful hotel, fabulous room, and the most attentive staff we have ever met.  Honestly we felt like VIPs.  We ate dinner in Il Pampero and it was simply delicious   as was breakfast - it was so hard to choose from all of the options.  To sum up, the hotel was just WOW"
November 2020,Excellence all round,"Even before I left Australia Dominick the customer service manager was in contact to make sure I would have all I preferred in my room on arrival. I was pleasantly surprised my room was ready upon early 6am arrival. Such a relief. The room was extremely comfortable with a lovely outlook and room to unpack . The staff at the hotel are extremely friendly, generous and certainly make sure you are well looked after. Such a pleasant change from a 5 star chain hotel. The bar and terrace area are unique and comfortable and was easy being a solo traveller to sit in a quiet area. The food offerings were delicious and breakfast off a very high standard. I really can’t thank the staff enough for catering to my needs and making me feel special. Taking the time to have a chat and making sure…"
November 2020,Absolutely stunning,"I was blown away by the entire experience at The Hari.  The team of staff were exceptional, interior was lush and rooms were so luxurious.  Everything we ordered to eat was perfectly cooked, my Husband said he ate the best pizza of his life in the bar which says a lot.  A must visit in Belgravia, even if just for a drink."
October 2020,Absolutley beautiful hotel with wonderful staff!,"From the minute we walked in to the hotel, we felt so welcome! All the staff were very friendly and attentive. The room was luxurious and had all the amenities. The bar was a lovely, relaxed atmosphere! And then breakfast in the morning was delicious and such a lovely end to our stay. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London."

October 2020,Excellent service and great location,A wonderful hotel with excellent and friendly staff. I stayed in room 603 and everything was perfect and the bed is incredibly comfortable. Most hotels at this price point have similar amenities but the true difference between all hotels is the staff. At the Hari the staff couldn't be more welcoming and professional and made me feel at home. I will stay again on my next trip to London and recommend the same to friends and family. Well done!
October 2020,Service second to non,"We chose the Hari for a recent staycation based on the reviews and the fact that the price point was a little more reasonable than some of the '5 star' London hotels. The stand out thing about this hotel is the service, which goes way beyond the extra mile, nothing was too much trouble, from getting our preferred morning papers  to arranging a massage at short notice. It is not a grand old building but the common areas have been decorated with taste and flair and are very comfy.  The only downside to our mind was the fact that the rooms were on the small side."
October 2020,Great Wedding Base,A great hotel with excellent staff. We used it as a base for my son’s wedding and the hotel staff couldn’t do enough to help it run smoothly. We spent a pleasant afternoon in the bar area and enjoyed some excellent Margaritas.
May 2021,Best night of 2020/2021,"Such a treat to get to stay at this hidden Belgravia gem after so many nights in my own bed! The staff instantly transform into friends; all incredibly welcoming and genuinely attentive . We stayed in the stunning Studio Suite overlooking the leafy park which cannot be faulted and being welcomed with a personalised amenity was such a lovely surprise. Cannot rate this hotel enough - the people, the ambience and the beautiful terrace - The Hari should be everyone's first port of call to escape their homes after the last year! Thanks to all xx"
May 2021,The best hotel I’ve ever been to,"We stayed at the Hari for my 50th birthday and I was so overwhelmed by the amazing service and kindness shown by all the staff. Everyone went over and above to make my birthday stay a very special one. We were given a very warm welcome when we arrived and I was wished a happy birthday. We were given a room upgrade and shown around the hotel. Our car was parked and cases brought to our room. We went shopping and were given an umbrella on our way out as the sky looked at bit dark.  When we returned there was a big balloon in my room, my favourite drink and a card which was such an amazing touch. We then went for dinner and again my birthday was acknowledged by the lovely staff and the food and service was first class in so many ways. The room was beautiful and very comfortable. I…"
May 2021,"Astounding, Kind, Exceptional","Stayed at the Hari for the night, the staff were amazing! We loved the personal touch on the entry into our suite. They were exceptionally attentive to our needs and we're following the guidelines so so well. I realised that if you are kind to them, they will always be super generous and kind to you,going the extra mile. Absolutely awesome! Can't wait to stay again"
April 2021,The Friendly Staff of The Hari,The staff is incredible. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. Always greeting you and asking if there is anything you need or what they can do for you. The guest relations manager even left a bag of treats in my room for my flight home. 
April 2021,Lovely hotel,"Beautiful hotel with a nice room layout. Received a complimentary upgrade which added to the experience.   The hotel staff were all very friendly and very professional - exactly what should be expected from all hotels, but isn’t always the case. "
April 2021,Excellent Bar & Restaurant,"Went to the terrace for celebration catch up post lockdown. Perfect outdoor space, to meet with friends.  Excellent service, cocktails and atmosphere. Would recommend 100% to all visiting South London."
April 2021,Beautiful terrace at The Hari,"A few friends & I were looking for somewhere to have some drinks & a bite to eat to celebrate the easing of lockdown and catch up after a year of not seeing one another, and stumbled across The Hari’s terrace having seen it advertised on a few Instagram pages.   From booking the table, to leaving the hotel - the staff were always attentive and keen to make the visit special - and it really was.   We had the most fantastic night, the service was brilliant and quick, the food was delicious (The Hari Club was a particular favourite, but the truffle chips were equally devine !) and unlike many other places I’ve seen - it was well heated and ventilated - so we felt safe & warm.   We’ll definitely be back!  "
December 2020,A Hidden Gem,"We were recommended this hotel as we needed to be within walking distance of Knightsbridge. The Hari is a hidden gem that oozes charm and style whilst embracing the very essence of British hospitality. This is a very chic boutique hotel with service to match. Rooms are well appointed and very comfortable and importantly for central London it was very peaceful enabling a perfect night's sleep. Breakfast was perfect and our waitress from Argentina (Maria I think?) couldn't do enough for us. The reception team were really sincere in their welcome and genuinely appreciated our custom, we will certainly return and can't recommend highly enough."
December 2020,Perfect hotel in central London,Now our go to hotel in London - feels like a home from home. Very warm welcome and the warmth and quality doesn’t deteriorate throughout the stay. Have stated a couple of times in recent months. Difficult to fault any aspect of the rooms and overall ambience. Thank you to the team for another great stay. Here’s to a less turbulent 21 for hoteliers.
December 2020,Great hotel with fantastic Staff,We stayed at the hotel with friends whilst we visited London. The hotel was fantastically clean and the staff were brilliant. We spent a great night in the bar drinking and enjoying some of the bar food. The only negative I took away from staying was the lack of milk in the room to make a coffee however the room service was phenomenal and quickly delivered those much needed morning coffee
June 2021,Loved it - total perfection - booking our return!,"Loved this hotel for many reasons.  Firstly the staff - they treat you like a guest in their home - very welcoming, super friendly, very professional, nothing is too much.  Perfect Belgravia location - especially if you want to go shopping!  Stylish looking interior and very comfy rooms that are very well considered from a practical perspective.  Loved the totally leafy outlook  and quiet location- not what you expect in London.  Great bar/ lounge area with gret menu.  Nice little touches like bikes that you can use,  mini bar in the room rate.   Perfect if you are after a boutique kind of experience - not a large impersonal hotel.  Booking our next stay.  Can't say enough.  THANK YOU!!!!"
June 2021,Such friendly and helpful staff,"A great overnight stay following a wedding reception - the staff were so friendly and helpful - nothing was too much trouble.

December 2020,Birthday Weekend,"The service was excellent from start to finish. On arrival, we were greeted by Ben, the concierge who took us through to Dom and Renata. All were very helpful and check in was quick and easy. Our room had amazing views of London and was very clean.

August 2020,Amazing Hotel,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hari for our one year anniversary, and it was incredible! The location was great, and the room itself was comfortable and clean. What really made our stay special though was how warm, welcoming, and beyond helpful the staff was, both at the front desk/concierge, and at the bar and terrace. We will definitely be back."
August 2020,Great hotel with great staff,"Second time at the Hari now and hotel has all you need and is clean and comfortable. The best part of the hotel is the fantastic staff! Thanks Dominick, Ben, door staff, reception and everyone else! Every time you are in and out of the hotel they are so polite and make you feel welcome. Also arrived to a lovely treat in the room for the occasion we were in London for! Really personal touch. Thanks again all at the Hari"
August 2020,Hidden Gem,"An elegant boutique hotel hidden away in central Belgravia tripping distance to Harvey Nics & Harrods. Provides luxury,  the personal touch and nothing is to much trouble for them . If they havn’t already thought about it they will ask and you will receive warmly. From the mixologist, concierge,  arranged personally via email from Dominick the manager who contacted me prior to my stay and the chef who prepared my individual dinner catering for my allergy.  The bar and Garden terrace are perfect to relax with friends, meet people , romantic and it has that   Soho House vibe. I can’t wait to go there again soon. You must  try the cocktail Jules they named it after me, you will love it."
August 2020,Exceptional service at the hotel,"We stayed the first night of the hotel reopening post COVID closure. It was our wedding night and all the staff at the hotel were amazing. The room was beautiful with great views, facilities were brilliant. It’s the perfect location to explore London from. But it was the service that set this hotel apart from the rest. The staff could not do enough to make our stay special, especially Dominic. I cannot recommend The Hari enough. "
August 2020,Cheeky luxury weekend break in London,"Decided to take the family to London for a post-COVID lockdown weekend break. We wanted something a bit special (Wedding Anniversary) so picked the Hari.  The hotel has special measures in place to keep visitors safe, such as cleaning regime and staff wearing masks.  The staff welcome from the front door onwards is brilliant. Every member of staff greets you in a genuinely warm way, always making sure you are being served and happy... every time you see them.  The rooms were fantastic (1 very big king, 1 twin) with views over the park. Very clean with every possible item a traveller might require in the room. Despite being near the road there is no noticeable traffic sound, so sitting in the window seat in our room watching the world go by was incredibly relaxing.  We dined in…"
August 2020,Great to be back,"We had the pleasure of staying at The Hari on their re-opening weekend. I was so excited to get back to London and enjoy a weekend away.   As is always the case, the stay did not disappoint, the staff were extremely attentive, the bar as always was great and overall this hotel does feel like home.   The rooms are extremely comfortable and we thoroughly enjoyed the delicious complimentary cookies waiting for us and appreciated the great mask/hand sanitizer kit.  The new breakfast menu is also great - the brioche roll is incredible! It is always lovely to see Marta in the restaurant.  Thank you for a lovely weekend and we will be back soon!"
March 2020,Lovely hotel and I would thoroughly recommend,"I visited the Hotel and stayed for one night. The Hotel is very stylish, clean and the standard rooms are a good size. W had lunch in the bar area and the food was very good. When I'm back in the area, I will definitely stay again."
March 2020,Would definitely recommend!,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Hari and would definitely recommend it. It is clean, spacious, nicely decorated, in a great location for exploring London, and has an excellent staff. We spent two nights at the Hari and cannot wait to return.

We will definitely return and would absolutely recommend to our friends and family."
December 2019,Wonderful experience,"I visited the Hari with some friends over a weekend and had the best experience ever. All the staff from the door to the desk and restaurant was very friendly and made me feel like home. Rooms are spacious and well appointed, loved the decor. The restaurant Il Pampero is delicious and very good value for money in Belgravia. We even got to meet the GM Andrew, no doubt he is responsible for the great vibe at The Hari. Highly recommend, will be back soon!!"
March 2020,Design hotel with lovely staff,Really arty design hotel in Direct proximity to Knightsbridge. The whole staff was very friendly and felt genuine in their concern towards my comfort during my stay. Alex at the reception was really warm and welcoming and showed me how the features in my room. I had a nice upgrade to a studio suite with lovely view on the square. The bar is quirky and there s a cigar patio should this be your thing. I definitely recommend this hotel on business trip!
March 2020,Delivering great service matters...,"It is not the first time that I visit The Hari and I must say that delivering great service in a consistent way does matter to this place! The staff is always very attentive, the reception service is amazing (Carlo was, as always, a great host when I arrived and when I checked out!) and the entire crew is always making me feel special. It is not just about the great service, it is about consistency and feeling part of a team that enjoys hosting you at their home. Great job, team The Hari!"
March 2020,Another Fantastic stay !,"We returned to the Hari for a nights stay and wasn’t disappointed, from our warm welcome and attentive door staff arranging our valet to the lovely reception team. Our room was perfect with a great view and in such a lovely location.  Would highly recommend"

Actually felt like at home, each people working in this structure are super friendly and careful, from the guys at the main entrance, passing by reception and concierge, going through the bar and the people working in housekeeping and concluding with the GM. THANK YOU SO MUCH, I can't wait to be back with you guys!!! Best of luck, Alessandro Mazzone "
February 2020,"Great People, Attentive & Friendly Service, Great Location","Rooms are very clean, with thoughtful amenities and extras. The staff are very friendly and appear to be caring and thoughtful. All are very helpful and polite.  They also appear to be genuine and non-scripted, which is very nice and sometimes hard to find in high-end luxury hotels."
February 2020,The kindest people ever,"I have stayed in many hotels all over the world and never encountered such kind and gentle staff. Starting from reservation to reception to all who were in service. They never said no to any of our requests, accommodating and warm the staff were always there to answer any request or question. Breakfast is of excellent choices and was lucky to have dinner at their Italian restaurant. Rooms are relatively small and in particular the toilet yet it is compensated with excellent service. Thank you"
November 2019,A warm welcome,I couldn’t find another warm place like the unique hotel. The stuff is very well trained to help in all ways. I even were surprised that they offer free mobile to take. That is called a royal treat. Just the thing I need.
November 2019,weekend at the Hari,"we had a very relaxing weekend at the Hari and spent a nice weekend in London with family and friends. room was very nice, but a bit on the small side and the icon can sometimes make  the atmosphere quite dry."
November 2019,An enjoyable weekend in London,"The Hari was a glorious unexpected surprise. The hotel is a home away from home, cozy and welcoming.  However the heart and soul of the hotel are the staff. This joyful gang of young people are extremely warm, attentive, and caring. They are the backbone and heart of the Hari."
November 2019,Absolutely fabulous - this is a lovely hotel that has become my home away from home,"What can I tell about The Hari apart from it's now one of my favourite hotels in the world. I absolutely love it! Not only is the location perfect - you can pop into Mayfair, the central shopping areas + go for strolls in Hyde Park really easily but what makes this hotel so special are the wonderful staff. From the front desk to the concierge everyone really cares that you have a great stay there. Alex the front desk manager is really attentive and his focus on the detail means everything is well catered for. The restaurant serves delicious Italian food and the head chef, Claudio is as passionate about his craft as I am about eating it! The concierge team are flawless - they managed to help us navigate around London. Every single recommendation was spot on...from dinner +…"
November 2019,The hari bar .,"Hello , it was really excellent work from the manager and the team, everything was really good and im very thankful for them . The service was more than good , the food , how they treated the customers and the terrace organization was something that literally not every bar have it in the way the the Hari bar have it . thankyou for the awesome staff , thankyou for the really good manger."
November 2019,Nice Spot!,"This hotel was very nice had a very stylish vibe. My only complaint is that the rooms are much smaller than depicted on the website, and it is a little bit of a walk to the nearest tube station. Other than that we had a very nice stay."
August 2019,Amazing stay overall,"This hotel should be a national treasure. Their staff is beyond incredible and the hotel itself is so comfortable and had all the amenities. As far as location at first glance it looks far off but it’s in such a nice quiet neighborhood that is within walking distance to everything you could need.  Their rooms are average size for London and they have turndown service. They were so accommodating and helpful during our entire stay.  The doormen were absolutely wonderful and helped with the stroller and our bags, anything we needed. I was beyond impressed and will choose this hotel again in the future."
October 2019,Amazing hotel bar,"Surely one of the Best hotel bars I have ever been. Great - Cozy atmosphere, everything was as I expected. Very good service. Staff members were friendly, polite and positive. I would definitely recommend it."

February 2020,Excellent Stay,I stayed at The Hari for one night and had a great stay. All the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable. We had dinner in the restaurant il Pampero which was excellent with very authentic Italian cuisine. My pasta was cooked perfectly and we enjoyed chatting a quick the head chef when he visited our table. The bed was comfortable and the room quiet overlooking the square with a great view in the morning. Breakfast was also very good with a selection of interesting and tasty smoothies. The gym was well equipped for a quick workout. I would definitely stay again.
February 2020,"Amazing hotel ,Staff & location ","I would like to thank The Hari team , From check in , Concierge, restaurant till check out . They did efforts to make this vacation memorable.  I stayed in a jr suit that was sunny , good size and beautifully decorated . The hotel staff is generous and brought a Champagne as a gift for my wife Bday (and additional  sweets)... I will definitely come back. Cheers  Yaron"
October 2019,"Comfortable, delicious, impeccable","My Partner and I have chosen The Hari and Il Pampero to celebrate his birthday. From the moment we walked in, greeted by the amazing staff, followed by personalised welcome card and treats, we could not have asked for more. The bed was one of the most comfortable we have ever slept and our dinner at Il Pampero was a real treat for all our senses. The whole staff has so attentive, friendly and professional and were actually the stars of our Hari experience. A special thank you to Violeta from the amazing concierge team who looked after us during our stay, Dominic and Alex. From Il Pampero Victorio and Leo offered great suggestions for dishes and cocktails."
October 2019,Lovely stay but couple of niggles,Just returned from a stay to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We are regular visitors to London but have never stayed at The Hari before. The location is fantastic and doormen and reception staff were very welcoming on arrival. The premium king room was fantastic with a lovely view and all the amenities you would need for a luxury stay.   We had an absolutely beautiful meal in the Italian Il Pampero restaurant.   The one issue I would say is the bar area. Service was pretty slow and there was a constant draft coming from the terrace and front doors of the hotel itself. The bar also had a really strong smell of cigars too which may not be off putting for some but it did make us move down to the sofa in the lobby.  I wouldn’t want to hang around in the bar too long if I went…
February 2020,The Hari Bar,I have visited the bar in the Hari hotel in Belgravia. A really nice place with interesting decoration and a really chilled atmosphere.  The drinks were really good and the weekservice outstanding.  I really recommend it mostly if you want to have a drink during the week.
February 2020,Great Experience!,We spent nine nights at the Hari and the accommodations were superb.  The staff presented themselves with the utmost professionalism.  Always a smile and helping hand every day.  Our room was immaculate and we enjoyed the special touches of the night turnout with sweet treats and a special welcome on our first day and a special goodbye on our last day.  The Hari knows how to make your experience a special one.  A special thank you to Violetta the concierge who was always willing and ready to help us no matter how small the request was.    Highly recommended!!
February 2020,Fantastic room,"Absolutely loved our room with the glass shower wall, beaded curtain- so different! Loved the outside roof type garden. Would highly recommend as it’s well placed to see all the sights London has to offer."
February 2020,"Great modern hotel, fantastic locatiom","I recently stayed at the Hari hotel as part of a business trip. The location is great, close to Hyde Park. The rooms are great and stylish. The hotel has a very nice bar and breakfast room as well. I would recommend this hotel for quick Londond trips. "
January 2020,great hotel,"we arrived in mid-January for a 4-day short vacation and  we booked in this hotel because of the location, the hotel has a nice interior design, looks new, service is really good, we had an issue in our room and they solved the problem very fast, the location is just great, il pampero restaurant we visited for breakfast only and its great"
February 2020,Lovely room and looked after amazingly,"Amazing stay, loved the room and all my needs were tended to, including an extra heater because I was cold!! The room was beautiful and loved the bathroom. Breakfast was great, can’t wait to come back!"
February 2020,First class in heart of Belgravia ,"This was my 3rd stay at The Hari, and I love everything about this hotel.  The warm informal reception and greeting, stylish spacious rooms with lovely views, and the superb location.   The concierge desk is highly professional and will help with anything you need, theatre bookings/shopping tips/cars etc.  Highly recommended!!!"
September 2020,30th birthday at the Hari,Staff were so friendly and welcoming. Room was very clean and fresh. I had a bottle of champagne waiting in my room for my birthday celebrations :-) I highly recommend this hotel - I will be coming back soon!
September 2020,Boutique at its finest,"Recently stayed here for a short trip to London and it could not have been better. The area is super nice and the rooms are well appointed but most of it all, the staff truly makes you feel like you are staying at someone's house. Super caring and kind. Will remain my 1st choice for future trips."
September 2020,Back at The Hari,"I was so good to be back at the Hari this weekend, being greeted by the staff which we havent seen for soo long.... those friendly faces, behind the masks of course, whilst taking the covid actions and regualtions the exsperience was  fabulous and some normality at last. We  love the location of this hotel along with the great selection of rooms... If you want a bath in the window, yes with a great view of the park then state this when booking, oh and to fall into the welcoming bed, which we had forgot how comfy this was.... It was great to go into the bar and have a glass of champagne, the ambience was uplifting.....  with this ill say , ill be back again soon!"
September 2020,Amazing experiences,"During the negroni week, i passed by the hari hotel and i had the opportunity to try the bulldog negroni made with mix of hibiscus infused gin,vermounth and orange zest, it was outstanding!!!😁the bartender Alessia was really friendly and very professional.Also Marta and Vittorio,who welcomed me,were on top of the floor and the service!i definitly come back😊"
September 2020,Gem of a hotel in Belgravia,"What a great experience! Lovely hotel, great rooms and really fabulous staff! Probably the best hotel staff in London. From the moment I arrived to the time I left I was made to feel fabulously welcome! "
August 2020,Style AND Substance in this haven of Boutique Luxury,I had the pleasure of staying at the Hari for 2 nights over the August bank holiday weekend. I had a great pre-booking experience speaking with Carlo (front desk) and Ricardo (Concierge) which spurred me on to make my booking. I was a little nervous about staying in a hotel for the first time since the start of the pandemic but honestly the reviews are completely justified by what I experienced. The cleanliness is superb and it is clear they are taking precautions and guest safety (as well as their own – rightly so) very seriously.   The staff I came into contact with were all so friendly and I got to know some of them (mainly the bar staff) on the terrace during my few days. I bought friends whom I was visiting in the city back to the hotel bar on both days and they all raved…
September 2020,Excellent staff and services,We had an excellent time in The Hari in London. The staff was very helpful and services were great. The room was spacious and very quiet with a nice view over London roofs. It was my first time at this Hotel and it will certainly not be my last.
August 2020,Great experience ,"We came here to spend a night of relax between friends. We were treated very well, especially from Alessia. Very beautiful place and amazing food. I really advice this place. We will come back as soon as possible."
August 2020,Perfect bar with accompanying service,"After googling ‘best rosé and sliders London’ I was not disappointed to arrive at The Hari. Had a terrific meal with terrific service on the terrace, followed by a complimentary taste of the Moët et Chandon iced drink, courtesy of Andre. Needless to say, we were sold and ordered another ‘for the road’.   Felt inclined to leave this review after returning today, 3 weeks later, for a lay over between Knightsbridge and home, where Andre was yet again an exemplary host, remembering us from last time and welcoming us back, serving with just the right balance of professionalism and charisma, and setting the tone for another lovely evening in the Hari.   Andre is the man! Thank you!  Ben & Harriet"
August 2020,Glorious contemporary-chic hotel with the personal touch,"I think this might be my new favourite hotel in London... tucked in leafy Belgravia, it's got stylish-chic warmth completely nailed. The staff are just wonderful and make you feel so welcome, and it's like stepping into the pages of an interior design magazine. The little touches are everywhere - from the bookcase lined bar, padded velvet nooks for cocktails, secret oasis garden terrace and fabulous Italian restaurant. But it's the rooms I loved the most - achingly stylish and yet still so cosy. My room felt it really had a personal touch, unique art and sumptuous materials, not to mention the bath overlooking the square in the window - so decadent! I can't wait to return."
January 2020,You would be foolish not to experience this hotel whist in London! ,"Our stay at The Hari London from stepping out of the car has been nothing short of 5* treatment!  Reception and concierge were warm and welcoming not to mention extremely helpful.  Our room was stylish and spacious. Food and beverage staff were extremely attentive, food was sublime and drinks maybe we had too many!   Perfect location for shopping, sightseeing and west end shows etc.   I cannot recommend this hotel any higher. Very LGBTQI friendly too.   This is my 2nd stay at The Hari and it most certainly wont be my last! "
December 2019,The Hari experience,"I would rate my stay at the Hari 10 out of 10. The stuff was very helpful all the time, also they were always cheerful so you started your day happy as soon as you step out of your room. The rooms and the interior of the hotel is very elegantly decorated. The location is also very convenient. Strongly reccomended."
November 2019,Great hotel experience,"Wonderful experience from check-in to check-out.  All hotel staff were extremely efficient, knowledgeable, and helpful.  The room was very nice, and well looked after by the housekeeping staff.  Excellent location within easy walking distance to London tube, shopping, sights, and restaurants."
November 2019,Lovely Hotel," My husband and I were visiting family in Cornwall and wanted to spend a few nights in London to end our trip.  My travel advisor coworker suggested The Hari and it was the perfect choice.   Quite but beautiful neighbourhood. Lots of restaurants and shops around.  We had breakfast and dinner at the hotels restaurant which was lovely.   All the staff were fantastic - ready to help with anything.   Hotel is beautiful - everything from the public areas, elevator, corridors to the room. Beautiful bathrooms, loved the shower, comfy bed and we had a sitting area looking out to the park.   Hotel was also quite - we know there were children on our floor but never heard a peep out of anyone.   We were also celebrating our anniversary and husbands birthday. The hotel left us a bottle of…"

I enjoyed my visit,.  The room was a reasonable size for the location, with a comfortable bed, well-equipped bathroom and some lovely personal touches such as the sweet treats left by the bed every night, something different each time.  The location is very good, just a few minutes walk from Sloane Street.  Although it is a busy area, I found the hotel quiet and peaceful."
December 2019,One of the best hotels in London ,"Very friendly staff, great rooms, great location, easy to access all shopping areas.  We enjoyed our stay and we will definitely come back.  Also we want to thank Sophia from the Hari hotel for all her efforts.  Regards  M.M"
December 2019,Nice hotel,"Lovely hotel.  Great room.  Very helpful and friendly staff. However, the lobby and bar on both evenings we stayed seemed to be full of single men all on their mobile phones!  None of them seemed to be together and it meant that it was difficult getting a seat in the bar.  Not sure what was going on but I certainly felt uncomfortable in the bar even with my  husband.  Such a shame as everything else was great."
December 2019,Wonderful experience:),"I spent a really nice weekend at the Hari hotel, fantastic design and the room was beautiful with all possible comfort. The staff was very professional and kind, and the restaurant downstairs ""Il Pampero"" offers really good Italian cuisine with first choice dishes and an excellent selection of wines. I would definitely recommend both Hotel and restaurant, I would stay here again without a doubt."
December 2019,Fabulous From Check In to Check Out,"From the moment we arrived, the staff were fantastic, welcoming and polite.the hotel bar, room and restaurant were equally impressive. Event the checkout was lovely, we will definitely stay here again."
December 2019,Love the hari,Love Vince  helpful and friendly staff i like the place.some days it gets really   busy  The have the best sweet seduction and chicken nugget s The hotel also is really nice and in a prime location however its kind of expensive
December 2019,"If not home, then a close second","Staff is warm, polite, professional, and helpful, without being pompous or fake - they are genuine hoteliers. Chef is exceptional :) Location is excellent. Rooms are comfortable and well appointed. I really like the fact that the bar/lounge area is upstairs, and hence separated from the lobby area downstairs.  It creates more intimacy and cosiness. And of course, saving the best for last: the Secret Garden! As a cigar aficionada, the small but beautiful cigar terrasse was the main reason I booked this hotel the first time, and why I also keep coming back. Thank you great Hari Team!"

November 2019,Fantastic Service in London,"My husband and I spent our 20th wedding anniversary at The Hari. We chose it for all of the 5 star reviews on-line and the location. We were not disappointed. From the moment we arrived to the minute we walked out the door to leave the service was impeccable. The staff helped us arrange tours and pre-pay, guided us on what Tube lines to take and made suggestions on where to eat. Il Pampero was out of the this world both nights we had dinner there. This hotel made us feel special every step of the way. We ended each night with a small bite of chocolate or whatever candy they left by our bed. We definitely plan to return and will definitely stay at The Hari."
November 2019,Excellent Hotel,I was extremely blown away by the incredible service at The Hari. Not only is it beautiful hotel in a great neighborhood but the staff went above and beyond to make sure all our needs were met. Can’t wait to come back here. 
November 2019,The best place,"In London i went to the best hotel the hari, The service was amazing and the hotel had the best donuts in the area. The hotel had bikes for the visitors and when we call for a room service it don’t take 4 minutes,so that’s why it is the best service,the best hotel tourist."
December 2018,An Unforgettable experience in the best area of London,"We visited the hari the previous month for 4 nights.From the day of check-in to the day of departure everything went more than perfect.We had an amazing cozy and beautiful room facing the park, the  sofa net to the window  was the best spot for me and my wife to enjoy our coffee, we absolutely loved it. The staff was very warm and welcoming and they were always willing to help us. The hotel  is located in belgravia a quiet and very beautiful area which is just a few minutes walk  from the tube station and for me personal the best place for shopping,  Harrods. I am sure that I have found my new spot in London.Can't wait to be back."
October 2019,Amazing,"I love The Hari, and I'll be back next time , I enjoyed every single moment , I really liked The Hari team , they do care about us , and doing every thing possible to make us feel good and happy ,what can I say more than this .? No one can do what you are doing for us guys. "
September 2019,THE HARI,"I had one of best staying in London at The Hari hotel and that's because of following reasons: 1. Location is great ,quiet ,secured and close to hyde park ,Harrods etc. 2. Staff were very cooperative and helpful  3. Rooms very clean and comfy  4. The have excellent Italian restaurant "
October 2019,Smiley and polite all around.Each time I walked in through the dorrs I felt like I was coming home.,"Room was atmospheric yet bright. Very comfortable. I love the view of the green square and trees. I love the desk at the window.  All the staff were incredibly polite and  friendly and ready to accomodate all requests, ranging from altering existing menu items to suit my dietary requirements to sending someone to help me weigh luggage to having something couriered for me.  Location is ideal- central yet quiet.  I love the decor."
October 2019,Attention to detail,"This is my third visit to The Hari and not only was I pleased with my beautiful room and upgrade, but I was also floored by the service and attention to detail. I was attending an exhibition opening and the staff brought me a plate of cookies congratulating me. Not just any plate of cookies, but one designed specifically for the gallery I am working with."
September 2019,Outstanding service!,"We chose The Hari initially for its great location and its warm feeling. We had booked a deluxe room but we didn't like the room we were first given. Upon asking the staff for alternatives, we were offered an outstanding room in the 8th floor with a breathtaking view over London. What's more, it was my wife's birthday and the management was extremely generous in offering us a bottle of champagne and nicely decorated sweets to celebrate her birthday in the warmth of our hotel room. We've been to tens of five stars hotels worldwide but such treatment remains truly rare. Two thumbs up for Staff and Management! This is how hotels should be managed!"
September 2019,Perfect Chelesa/Belgravia boutique hotel,"Perfect boutique hotel in a prime location. If you haven't stayed in Belgravia, you are missing out on the most beautiful, residential neighborhood in London. The hotel is central to Chelsea, Knightsbridge and Kensington. Great shops (including Harrods) and restaurants are a short walk from the hotel. It's my new home away from home while visiting London."
September 2019,Amazing hotel in beautiful quiet surroundings,"The Hari is located in one of the best locations in London, close to parks and high-street shopping. The service was fantastic and left us at ease for the whole duration of our stay. Will for sure stay at the Hari again. "
September 2019,Outstanding boutique hotel with a warm and welcoming staff,Our stay at the Hari could not have been better. We loved the location and our room was extremely comfortable and well appointed. The two small sitting nooks were cozy and made for a ideal  spot to curl up and read or just take in the view. The bathroom was also very nice and the shower was one of the best. The staff at this hotel was what made our stay truly special. Each and every person did their best to make us feel welcome and valued. From neighborhood restaurant recommendations to museum suggestions we found them to be spot on.
September 2019,A Home away from home,"Love love love this hotel!!! The Hari is truly a 5 star hotel in London! From the front desk to the concierge to the doormen, they are all amazing and ready to help with any need you may have. Ash & Alex & Ben & Michael went above & beyond to help us with any request. They even surprised us with balloons & champagne & brownies in our room for my daughters birthday! Amazing! I My daughter had a headache from the flight in & without asking them Michael showed up at our door with a bottle of aspirin for her. Ben arranged reservation for a tea for us that was fabulous. They make you feel like family.  Ash was lovely  upon arrival the printed a beautiful booklet tied with a ribbon for us with info of shops & restaurant & charming spots in London to see.  Just can’t rave enough about…"
June 2019,Simply amazing,"Having visited with our five year old son for a short Christmas break and loved it so much, we decided to return to celebrate our wedding anniversary in June. On arrival we were upgraded to the most stunning accommodation I have ever seen in London; with views across the capital and a real sense of calm despite being so central. From the moment you arrive until you reluctantly leave, The Hari is utterly luxurious without any pretentiousness. Eating out in the surrounding Belgravia was made all the easier with some fantastic recommendations from the concierge and the restaurant Il Pampero located within the hotel is a must. I cannot recommend The Hari enough - amazing staff, perfect location and a beautiful, modern take on a luxury hotel. We cannot wait to return."
September 2019,Service of the highest order,"After BA (pilot strike) cancelled our planned 30th Wedding Anniversary trip, we decided to spend a night in London with a meal at the Amaya Grill and Bar (so deserving of its Michelin star). We chose the Hari as it is a short walk from the restaurant.   What a lucky decision, we were greeted in the lobby by the most friendly staff and immediately upgraded. On being shown to our room we found it decorated with many balloons surrounding the bed and thirty smaller ones on the covers, what a kind thought by the hotel staff, and a lovely surprise.   When we later returned to the room a plate of sweets and a message in chocolate sauce wishing us a Happy Anniversary awaited us, and a complimentary bottle of Champagne on ice.  Many thanks to the management and staff, your service and…"
February 2020,Miss,I highly recommend the Hari hotel . I had an amazing stay . The staff are extremely friendly and welcoming . The service is outstanding. It’s the best boutique hotel in London . Perfect location . I can’t wait to return it’s a 5 stars 🤩 from me . Thank you to the amazing team at the Hari love it !!!
February 2020,Couldn't recommend enough,"We went to the Hari for my wife's birthday and we couldn't have made a better choice! Stunning bedroom, amazing view, nice amenities awaiting in our room. The staff were just perfect: very professional, polite, helpful but not intrusive. Loved it!!!"
January 2020,Amazing modern hotel on a quiet embassy-area.,"Fantastic service from we arrived to we left. Sophie in the reception know how to welcome the guests, We got a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe room, and later they sent a fabulous gift to our room because of my birthday 2 days before.. Breakfast was a la carte. We didn't try the continental or English breakfast. But had omelette and coffee, which was good. Rooms were big and modern with pop art, and cleaning and room service excellent. The shower could have more pressure.  I will recommend this hotel to everyone who don't want to stay around Oxford street, but near Harrods and the luxury shops on Sloane Street.(5 mins walk)"
January 2020,courtesy even to non residents,"Last Sunday, a slightly rainy day, I walked past the beautiful facade entrance of The Hari. I decided to look inside, just to see if I may stay here on a future trip. (I will). After 10 minutes, I walked out, when I heard a voice behind me shout out ""Sir,"" I looked back, and saw the doorman, waving a small folded umbrella at me. ""Sir, may I offer you an umbrella?"" I hesitated, then walked up to him. I told him I was not a hotel resident. He said, ""I know, sir, I just thought, it would be nice if you had an umbrella."" I accepted the umbrella, and I was very impressed at this young man's knidness. Thank you, Cosmin, it rained a lot later, I would not have been able to continue my walk without the umbrella.  I thought of your kindness and I thank you very much. The Hari should be…"
January 2020,Exceeded all expectations - perfection,"Me and my boyfriend stayed here for one night and we could have stayed a whole month! Upon arrival we were greeted by Kleandra who was very welcoming and pleasant, she really made us feel at home straight away. She showed us to the suite we were staying in and it was beautiful with special touches because we were celebrating our 6 year anniversary. Olga had covered the bed in petals and left a lovely note for us. The room was immaculately clean, and the décor was lovely. The bed was incredibly comfortable with additional blankets if needed. There were plenty of amenities also. The view from the room was great with three balconies to view the skyline from. In the morning we had breakfast in the downstairs restaurant and it continued to exceed our expectations. Nando served us,…"
January 2020,One of the best hotels I've stayed at in years,"Arriving early in the morning after our overnight trans-Atlantic flight, we were welcomed with open arms. The front desk and lobby staff were great, polite yet friendly. Although our room wasn't ready when we got there at 8:30am, they stored our bags and then called us to let us know when our room was ready--at 11:am! The room was stylish, immaculate, and roomy compared to most European hotels. The bed and bath were palatial. We had a room on an upper floor and the view was awesome with the dome of St. Paul's off in the distance. The location on Chesham Place is a lovely refuge just outside the tumult of Knightsbridge. Because it is relatively small, the personal serve and quality of accommodations combine to give this hotel the feel of a much more luxurious spot--particularly…"
January 2020,Value for money in an upmarket part of London,"Having lived in this part of London for years and walked past the hotel regularly, to now stay at The Hari was a very pleasant surprise. Great value for money, attentive staff and, at last, a hotel which does not seek to make money our of everything! the complimentary coffee, water and wifi was a joy. Excellent location and great restaurant. We'll be back!"
January 2020,Perfect hotel to for 50th Anniversary Celebrations,"From check in to checking out, our stay at The Hari was excellent and without any problems. As stated on previous reviews, the staff here do make this such an amazing hotel. Location is excellent, not far from the Tube Station. We had a great two day stay here January 2020, would definitely recommend this Hotel, and we would certainly stay here again."
January 2020,What a great start to 2020,"We very much enjoyed our stay at The Hari .It was really spectacular experience, the hotel location was great . What made us love the hotel the most was the staff, they are incredibly friendly and willing to help us in any way they can. The housekeeping was amazing as well.  Thank you The Hari hotel for a great start to 2020 ♥️"
January 2020,Fabulous hotel within striking distance Knightsbridge and the Royal Parks,I stayed at the Hari with my partner and Cavapoo Chip for a night in December as we wanted to explore the area and walk in the Royal Parks.  Alex and his team were fantastic and couldn’t do enough for us during our stay. The hotel itself is a little slice of tranquility a few steps from the hustle and bustle of Knightsbridge.  It’s great as a base and the bar on the mezzanine level is a great place to relax and watch the world go by.  If you want a hotel with a personal touch that has all the advantages of a luxury chain then The Hari is worth a visit.  You wont be disappointed!  Angelina & Chip xx
August 2019,Luxury Boutique Experience in a Fabulous Neighborhood,"I did a ton of research to select a hotel for a family trip to London in August. I actually had initially chosen another hotel in Kensington because it seemed luxurious, conveniently located and geared towards families (our son is 9), which is what I was looking for. But by the time I got around to booking that one, my preferred room type was unavailable. I restarted my search and stumbled upon The Hari, which I initially was worried might not be family friendly enough. To be fair, it did cater to a more adult clientele with a bar that had patrons gathering out front every night, but the staff made us feel very welcome and never once did we feel like we were out of place. Every time we returned from our day's touring, my son was greeted by the doorman with a high five :) We …"
August 2019,Leisure Trip," The hotel was in the perfect spot and just the right size, not too big not too small! Every single employee was excellent and made us feel at home at all times! The  restaurant staff could not have been nicer!  Overall, from the moment we stepped into the hotel till the second we left we felt like we were at home. All details and details we hadn’t even thought of war taken care of for us. They had twice a day care of your room and the room was spotless. Such a convenient location if you don’t want to be in the heart of the city but close enough to get there by foot or taxi very quickly. We will be back.  "
July 2019,Its all about the service,"6 night personal stay at the Hari.  Very well located in a quiet yet central part of town,  Very well positioned for shopping in Knightsbridge and Sloane street as well as close to Hyde Park, I would highly recommend taking one of the hotel's bikes and cycling around for an hour or two.  Room was compact but well appointed and very quiet.  Housekeeping was excellent, turndown service, etc was flawless, I wasn't ever disturbed in the morning.  Service was very good, you called down to order ice and 3 minutes later you have it in your room.  Great option in London"
August 2019,The Hari,"I enjoyed my staying at the hari hotel, it is a perfect experience I ever had in London.  Love the location, staff and the cozy environment.  Definitely will book the hotel again in future.  Thank you all."
August 2019,Very relaxing and cool place,"I've been in my first time in the Hari hotel and didn't desapointed. Food in Pampero restaurant was very delicious. After I went to the bar upstairs to have some coctails and it was right place, beautiful atmosphere. The coctails from Alessia was awesome. She were so attentive and friendly. And  all staff was really nice and helpful. I think her name was Vanessa who was really cool and engaging with me. Guys, thank you very much for lovely evening. Ill definitely come back and spread the word to my friends."
August 2019,Good Location & Nice Hotel,"We stayed here for one night on a weekend. The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was clean and comfortable. Not too much of a view from the room (2nd floor). However, the hotel is in a great location. The hotel seemed busy in the evening, but didnt cause any disruption and no noise could be heard in the rooms. "
August 2019,Fabulous hotel,"Due to work I travel too and from London quite a bit and have stayed in many hotels, and in my opinion this is one of the best by far! Just a few minutes from the fabulous shops of Knightsbridge and tube stations getting around is no problem. The rooms are stylish and well equipped with everything you could need and more (I especially liked the sweets treats left in the room on an evening) food in the hotel restaurant is 5*. In all I had an amazing stay and can’t wait for a return trip soon ❤️"
August 2019,Amazing hotel,"We stayed at the hotel for two night whilst in the city for work. From the moment we arrived to the moment we checked out, nothing was any trouble! Rooms are spacious and stylish and have everything you would expect and more from a central london hotel, and maid service twice a day which is a nice touch! A trip that was meant to be work ended up feeling more like a mini break! I cant thank the hotel staff enough for a pleasurable stay and cant wait to stay again! Hope to see you all soon"
August 2019,THE VERY BEST! ,"Let’s start by saying this hotel is The Very Best hotel I’ve stayed in in London!  We arrived at the hotel early at 1pm check in isn’t until 3pm, we were greeted, our bags taken and guided to the bar area where staff worked to allocate us our room as quick as they could even though we were early! Champagne on arrival and made comfortable until we were escorted to our rooms. Rooms are light, airy and spacious, amazing facilities and luxurious to say the least. Best nights sleep I’ve had in a hotel in London.  Breakfast service was simply superb and food quality outstanding.   Concierge we’re extremely attentive and helped us get to work for our show on time without a hitch.   The whole atmosphere of the hotel is warm and friendly and really is a home from home with that added…"
August 2019,Gustavo Munoz,"Very poor front desk atention, I waited 8 hours to get my room after a 14 hours trip. Having a request for early check in with OK. when I got angry my room appear in 5 minutes, was the worst of the hotel as a penalty. Bill a coffe plus a glass of regular water for 20 pounds AS A CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST. Concierge service did not know about Google to get phones for booking, never got one reservation and did for myself."
August 2019,Best experience ever in their Italian restaurant!,We had dinner at this incredible restaurant on Monday the 12th of August and we had no idea we would be in for such a treat. The chef suggested some of his best dishes and we were surrounded by waiters giving the ultimate Italian experience especially when they served the most delicious home made pasta in a pecorino wheel! I thoroughly recommend this little gem if you are looking for a convivial dinner with friends with an authentic Italian feel.
July 2019,Great hotel,"Great location, near the attractions but not too crowded. The design and service of hotel is great as well. The valet parking cost 50 pounds, a bit expensive but it is hard to find a hotel with car park at London centre. We arrive on Thursday, this we have to pay the congestion charge if we go anywhere, because the hotel is just very near the Zone."
August 2019,Boutique quality,Loved this hotel. A real gem in the middle of Knightsbridge with a great bar and restaurant.  Great rooms beautifully presented but a little on the small side. Staff really personal and knowledgable of the area.
July 2019,Nice boutique hotel in a great location,"I stayed at The Hari with my daughter in July 2019. This was a repeat visit for me as I had stayed there before and loved the hotel and the great location. On check in there was an issue with the room thats was given to me, and the hotel staff resolved it to my satisfaction. I thus wanted to give a note of thanks to both Eleonara at the front desk and her manager Renata for solving the problem. It was this attitude and resolution that made my stay totally comfortable and satisfactory. Rooms are a bit on the smallish side, but not too small as to be uncomfortable. All the room and toilet facilities are great and there is a turndown service every night with some amazing chocolates left on the pillow.  I also need to thank Violetta from the Concierge service who found me tickets to…"
August 2019,The hari hotel London,"The hari , what a great hotel ,we always used to stay at the savoy but after trying here once we have been going here for years , with this hotel you have a friendly face who remember you ! each time we come we are always looked after , the hotel is very clean and modern with a warm feel, the staff are always helpful and lovely. Rooms are all excellent standards with different views of wonderful London. We have stayed here many times as a couple and we have also spent time here with our children ranging from 2 -12 years old the area is great as we like the quiet streets which feel safe and a short walk away from Harrods and Harvey Nichols , a great all rounder hotel you would not be disappointed."
July 2019,The bar  in hari hotel ,From the best bars and hotel in London and the waiters was very friendly and helpful and the food was very delicious specially the pasta and the burgers and from the dessert the donuts I really had a great time 
July 2019,A friend and I spent 11 wonderful days in the care of all the lovely staff at the Hari Hotel London.,We were so impressed with the attention to detail and the friendly helpful staff at the Hari Hotel London.  We will be returning soon!  We have travelled the world and this hotel is at the top of our list.  What a wonderful way to start and end each day!
May 2019,Amazing Hotel,"Nice & clean room, amazing breakfast a la carte, good position.  I enjoyed “The Apple of Belgravia” drink at the bar...recommended!  Kind and welcoking staff, I really bar a good time there with my best friend ! "
July 2019,Excellent boutique hotel in Belgravia,"Excellent boutique hotel in Belgravia.  Hotel is ideally situated in Belgravia with easy access to many stores and offices. The hotel bedrooms were very comfortable and the staff were accommodating.  We enjoyed the morning breakfast buffet and the bar located on the second floor was convenient.  If traveling for business in London and you need to be in Belgravia or nearby areas of Knightsbridge,  Chelsea or around Hyde Park, then I recommend this hotel."
July 2019,beatiful hotel,The hari hotel is one of my favourite in london. The rooms are modern and elegant. The service is good and receptive. Ours was a bit noisy because the Windows needed some further sealing but that will be dealt with by the hotel.   Prices are ok considering the quality of the hotel and the service.  Location is pretty convenient as well.
May 2019,Excellent Hotel & Service,"We stayed only for one night and wished we had booked for longer. The service was outstanding, and by far the best place we have stayed in London. Very comfy rooms and the attention to detail was appreciated! Our son just loved his sofa bed with the TV in front of him. Definitely will stay again when in London."
June 2019,Gorgeous boutique hotel,"Loved everything about The Hari, from the men that help you out of the taxi and with your bags to the reception staff, the housekeeping really helpful and the waiters and waitresses so very patient and helpful. Thank you all we will be back! "
May 2019,Great Customer Service & Quiet Rooms,Terrific front desk crew and concierge.  Larger rooms than average for downtown London.  In quiet neighborhood of Belgravia/Mayfair.  10 minute walk to the subway.  Easy location to get Ubers or taxis.  Big TV was impressive in the room.  Nice bar and terrace area.
December 2018,"Great location, small room, nice overall","We stayed at The Hari for a few days, and the location is great, just a 5 minute walk to Harrods, and the other shops and attractions that are nearby. The room was small, with just enough room for the bed, but nothing else. The view from the room was non-existent, just another building. I wanted to like The Hari, and although the hotel was quaint, clean, and nice enough, it did not meet my expectations based on cost and location, which made me expect more. I suppose that this is one of the issues with smaller, independent boutique hotels, where it is hard to predict what one will get. I will look for a different hotel on my next trip to London."
May 2019,The perfect spot for three days in London,"I just had a wonderful three night stay at The Hari and cannot wait for my next visit.  Our room was large with a great park view.  The location is perfect for shopping at Harrods or Harvey Nichols, a coffee in Chelsea or a late night snack at EL&M.  The staff was incredibly nice and helpful and kind as could be. We loved the garden terrace for a drink and snacks as well."
May 2019,Classy all the way including the people.,"We loved it. Enthusiastic and laid-back people at the same time. Fresh in every day. Super comfortable common areas. Good-sized rooms. Black-out curtains. Zero noise from the street. Terrific, authentic Italian restaurant with full Italian staff. Eat fish. Salt encrusted. Eat salad. Any salad. "
May 2019,Wow! Worlds apart from other top hotels ,"Where do I begin? I absolutely loved my stay at The Hari and cant compliment them enough on outstanding service, attention to detail, personal touches and overall plush, stylish surroundings.  I was visiting London on Business to attend a premiere at the Saatchi gallery and had media traveling with me. The hotel and the team on the front desk couldn’t have been more helpful or welcoming. From the moment we arrived we were greeted with big smiles and a helpful manner. Our bags were whipped off us and when they were delivered to our room, the very kind gentleman showed us how to work everything. Yes, there are things to learn! 😄 in the room there was a handy roaming mobile that you could carry out with you to have access to the internet and make calls for free as well as…"
May 2019,Wonderful stay at the Hari Hotel,"Staff were friendly and attentive. The room was quiet and clean.  Turn down snacks and bottled water were a nice touch.  The bathroom was quite small but ok.  We found the push switches for the lights to be a bit annoying as you often had to push them several times to work.  We used the complimentary Handy portable device however a mobile hot spot might have been more useful.  I think you have the option to use the Handy device as a Hot Spot for a daily fee.  The Hari is in a very nice area, fairly close to bus stops and tube stations."
May 2019,Sheer Perfection ,"What can you say other than I seriously upset it was one night only!  From arrival to room this is a blissful experience, peaceful location and a flawless check in and front to house....such a perfect experience having flown in the day before for meeting and flying the next day.  Staff were excellent and helpful, and a great reception that was more spacious by design than anything else.  Room superb, brilliant bathroom and excellent shower.  Really powerful rain shower.....a rarity.  Bed was incredibly comfy and a real fight to leave it the next day, the room was spacious and had a superb window sofa that had amazing views...such a great room, if you had time and a book this was the place to be.  The hotel bar was great, superb cocktails and snacks and a great roof terrace. …"
May 2019,Fabulous ,"We stayed for 6 nights. Hotel is beautiful. Staff are outstanding. Rooms are immaculate. Location is excellent — 5 minute walk from Hyde Park, 10 walk to Buckingham Palace, 15 walk to Trafalgar, 10 walk to South Kensington. Definitely would stay again. "
June 2019,little gem in Belgravia,"What a great find!  I made a late booking in June, so many of my London standbys were sold out.  I had never heard of The Hari, but it was available, and the reviews were great so I crossed my fingers in hopes that it would be ok.  And boy, I LOVED it.  From the moment I walked in, I was made to feel like a member of the family with warm welcomes from all the staff.   In my small but beautifully appointed room, were snacks and a bottle of wine, plus a welcome note.  (I don't drink so they brought me a bottle of mineral water instead). At that moment I thought, ""whatever snafus I might encounter, all is forgiven based on the awesome staff alone.'  But there were no snafus--my room had a sweet alcove overlooking the park, the bed was PERFECT, the room was silent, there was a tub…"
May 2019,Classy hotel,"We were picked up at Heathrow by an excellent driver organised by the hotel. Off to a good start. Chose this hotel due to close location for Chelsea Flower Show, stylish decor and great reviews. As with much of the surrounding area, the hotel entrance was beautifully decorated in flowers. From the moment we arrived till being waved off 5 days later, the staff couldn’t be more accommodating. My husband in a wheelchair was helped with a ramp for the steps at the entrance and in and out of taxis. The elevator is tight but doable. The female concierge always with a smile and helpful tip. We enjoyed breakfast each morning in the lovely restaurant. Other guests dressed very elegantly. In fact all guests we came across at any time were very elegantly dressed which was wonderful, but…"
June 2019,Amazing Stay at the Hari,"I had an amazing 1 night stay at the Hari- I wished it were longer!  The staff was so accommodating, the room was beautiful and the location was perfect.  Prior to our stay I reached out for afternoon tea and dining recommendations.  They booked a few for us to give options so that we wouldn’t miss out as weekends get busy.  It turned out that they made reservations for us at two of the most famous places in London and we were lucky to get reservations as both places usually have a waiting list!  We also shared with the hotel that we were celebrating our recent engagement and they went above and beyond to celebrate with us.   I will be back and definitely recommend! "
June 2019,Tasteful stopover,"Couldn’t ask for more, good service from arrival throughout, Rooms nice and tasteful , simple electrics and no stupid gimmicks, good bar and food also, overall excellent in a very nice part of london and a new favourite for trips "
June 2019,Flawless from start to finish.,"My husband booked a night at The Hari for us to celebrate both my birthday and our first wedding anniversary. We've always been fans of sourcing boutique hotels over your well-known chain brands and The Hari didn't disappoint.   A hidden gem in the heart of Belgravia, a stones through away from the iconic Harrods and boasting top floor views over the City of London which is a spectacle to see at sunset.   We arrived early, prepared to leave our bags for a later check-in, however, our room was ready for us. Not the room we had initially booked though, instead The Hari, very kindly, upgraded us to their exquisite Penthouse suite for us to enjoy our double-celebration weekend in style. We were shown to our suite and advised that should we need anything during our stay, the…"
June 2019,Excellent Staff at The Hari,"The Hari staff was the best part of  our stay.  Everyone went out of their way to make sure we had everything we required. Everyone was pleasant, respectful  and eager to assist.  I have stayed at grander, more luxurious hotels before but I have never had better service.  Special thanks goes to the front desk staff, the concierges and the bellmen.  They were excellent ambassadors for The Hari. For this reason, I will highly recommend The Hari to friends and colleagues traveling to London."
June 2019,Mr L,"Wonderful hotel, wonderful location, superbly friendly staff. Pure 5* plus hotel that provides a unique individual experience.  As soon as you enter the Hari you are welcomed by knowledgeable staff and incredible decor of a stunning hotel."
May 2019,wonderful hotel choice for London,this hotel was truly one of the best we have ever stayed in and we have traveled  on 6 continents The room was clean the bedding was excellent but the best part was the hotel services and the staff They were OUTSTANDING
May 2019,The Hari Hotel will be our first choice for accommodation in London!,The staff were so friendly and helpful in every way possible. We had not stayed at the Hari previously and were not sure what to expect. They did not disappoint and provided us with the best stay we could have imagined.
March 2019,"LOVE LOVE LOVE! Your need to stay here, what a gem!","This hotel has been one of my most absolute favorite hotels that I have had the pleasure of staying in.  It's chic, a gem to find, and it the lovely area of Belgravia. The area of Belgravia is so gorgeous and the hotel is beautiful and the people that work there are lovely.   I stayed here on the weekend when I arrived from travelling from Australia for what seemed to be around 40+ hour of travelling. My friend and I were greeted with fresh lychee juice, a wonderful concierge and check-in staff. They provided us with bicycles where in a short 5 minutes we had already ridden to around Hyde Park. The area was very safe at night and the architecture of the surrounding buildings was stunning.   We loved the street nearby recommended by the doorman where we got fresh pastries and…"
May 2019,Perfection,"What a fantastic 1 night stay at The Hari. From the moment we arrived, the service was excellent. Thank you for some lovely touches in the room as we celebrated our wedding anniversary. Oh, and what comfortable beds!!! A hotel definitely looking out for its guests & we will be sure to return.  "
May 2019,Great experience ,"My wife and I went for our 5th anniversary and staying at The Hari was a great decision. We loved the location, the design of the room, the friendliness of the staff (specially Ivan at the front desk and Violetta in the concierge), etc  We would definitely go back to Hari in our next visit to London vs staying in the traditional huge 5 star hotels.   Thanks Hari staff and looking forward to see you soon. "
May 2019,Belgravia’s hidden Beauty*,"A hotel with exceptional service, exceptional quality and luxurious rooms. Travelled here on my own for overnite stay before moving on to Cologne but this is the memory I wont forgot. They graciously accommodated a 6am very early check in after long flight from Australia. The room was immaculate and spacious. The bathroom a dream. I will be back in the future with my wife and three children when we are next in town. My chosen new “home” for London holidays and fun. Thank you Hari. BTW...the Italian restaurant was A1."
May 2019,Amazing stay,"We came for the weekend and we were welcome by an amazing team. Everything was very relaxing and easy, we loved the atmosphere. The bar and restaurant are fantastic. We wished we could have stayed longer !"
May 2019,Authentic Italian restaurant.,"I’ve been to the Hari for dinner at Il Pampero with my partner’s family. Let’s start by saying that the restaurant is absolutely lovely, very cozy and beautifully designed. The food is extremely tasty, very well presented and the service it’s one of the most attentive I’ve ever experienced; very recommended for a proper Italian meal in London. Can’t to wait to be back!"
May 2019,Favourite London hotel,"As an ex Londoner, I am very particular about where I stay when I come to visit. I love the location of The Hari: situated on one of the quieter side streets of Belgravia but within walking distance of Knightsbridge, Sloane Square, and South Kensington, it is perfectly located.  The hotel is extremely handsome, with beautiful urban decor which reminds me of some of the better boutique hotels in New York, and the rooms, whilst small, have a lovely comfortable feel without being stuffy (not a whiff of chintz here thankfully!) The service was impeccable, I stayed just under a week and was made to feel totally at home by everyone working here. I highly recommend the restaurant: whilst the Maitre D' is a little aloof, the food is delicious and the people watching is worth it."
May 2019,Simply The Best,We travel a lot worldwide and always strive for the best hotel experience. The Hari was recommended to us by a very experienced senior hotel executive who clearly knows his hotel business. We loved every moment of our brief stay. The staff couldn’t be more friendly and attentive. The accommodations were charming and comfortable. The food at the restaurant was superb. We will remain grateful for the experience and we will make The Hari our first choice of a hotel for all of our future visits to London. 
May 2019,Our Only Place to Stay in London,"This is our 3rd visit to The Hari and we love it here. It’s located in a quiet neighborhood but still walkable to major attractions, restaurants or underground stations. The staff is exceptionally friendly and always welcome you back inquiring about your day’s adventure. They gave us some great advice on how to get to one of the less visited attractions so that we would have good views of the city. The rooms are very nice with all the amenities you expect plus. We enjoy stopping in at the bar for a drink after a long day out. The breakfast buffet is very lovely. We didn’t eat dinner there (as we have our favorites in the area that we walk to) but I’ve heard that it’s the best Italian restaurant! "
May 2019,Mother’s Day Weekend Gone Bad,"I stayed here during Mother’s Day weekend. I selected the hotel based on reviews and 5 star hotel. So I expected exceptional service. I was surprised of how low the ceilings were however I will say do not order room service. The first night we were jet lagged so ordered room service. The hotel charges you for the serving tray to bring the food to you which converts to $5.72 USD each tray. I’ve never stayed at any 5-star hotel that does this. The next night I stayed at the hotel in the evening as my family went out. My family dropped something off at the hotel to take to front desk but the bell man said he would take upstairs. I heard one knock at the door and as I was getting out of bed to see who it was, my door was opened. It was the bell man. I’ve never stayed at a hotel…"
April 2019,The Hari is a must-stay in London!,"The Hari is a fantastic boutique property in Mayfair. It really feels like you're visiting a quiet, off the beaten path part of the city in a local neighbourhood. The rooms with the tub with the large windows makes for a unique view of the city."
July 2019,Very nice hotel," I am coming from Hong Kong  with my family , and I choose to come back again ,All the staff there are so nice and friendly , and specially Subine is very helpful and offer a tea for me with their lovely  biscuit"
May 2019,"Excellent Hotel, Excellent Location","We wanted a hotel where we could easily walk to many things and The Hari is perfectly located for that. Approx 15-20 minute walk to Buckingham Palace. As others have mentioned its easy access to Harrods and other sights. Excellent, helpful staff ensuring a welcome every time we returned from our travels. Belgravia is a lovely suburb with elegant buildings and very quiet. After spending our days walking, we didn’t want to venture too far for dinner. We ate at the hotel (very nice) and found a couple of pubs and restaurants within a reasonable distance of the hotel."
June 2019,Amazing find in London,My 17 yr old son and I stayed at The Hari for our 3rd trip to London and it was fabulous. It was a home away from home. Staff was always friendly and helpful and directed us to the most wonderful places for dinner— sometimes going out to the street to  literally point us in the right direction. Amazing location without the noise  of London! We will definitely be back. I just saw a more recent review being upset at their room— this is a city so regular rooms are small like NYC but that should not deter you from having a fabulous time at The Hari! Hope to be back soon!!
July 2019,Absolutely Fabulous,"Tonight my friends and I had a lovely evening in il Pampero. Everything from our greeting at the door by Sophia, cocktails at the bar by Giampierro, three course meal with delicious Italian wine and the most amazing pastas, our evening was perfect. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for for a great place for a special occasion. Thank you."
July 2019,Fabulous hotel in a great location,"Just returned from my stay and everything was as advertised (maybe even better) staff was incredibly helpful and welcoming from the moment we arrived - the concierge Violetta could not have been more helpful. Our room was lovely - particularly the window seat overlooking the square! location was great - easy walk to Harrods, Harvey Nichols and other fine shopping. Located very close to 2 underground stops (Sloane Square and Knightsbridge) and easy walks to tourist attractions like Buckingham Palace and The Victoria and Albert Museum. The neighborhood is wonderful - full of great restaurants, pubs and coffee bars. Highly recommend - already planning my next visit."
June 2019,Perfect location!,Awesome helpful staff! Location in a quiet area of London yet close to all attractions. The bell staff were perfection. Concierge super helpful with suggestions and securing tickets for London attractions. 
June 2019,Just perfect!,This boutique hotel is very tastefully decorated and comfortable with a great location but it is the staff who truly make it extra special. Every member of the Hari team went out of their way to ensure a perfect stay!
July 2019,Style and warmth in a great location,"The Hari is a great option when in London.  The location is terrific, the staff is impeccable, and the boutique-style decor is modern and comfortable.  Wonderfully comfortable beds, sleek and functional bathrooms, and a central but quiet area."
June 2019,Outstanding visit,Amazing stay nothing was too much for the staff. Outstanding customer service particularly Vanessa from the bar. Attention to detail in not only the room but the whole hotel is second to none. Drinks on the terrace is a must along with the dough balls
June 2019,Great boutique hotel,"We stayed at The Hari after travelling from the Maldives (long journey!) and the location couldn't have been better! Situated right in the centre of London, the hotel itself was a great and short walk from most of the sights and top spots in the city.  The service was excellent - every bit of attention to detail was noted and well appreciated.  We did rate this 4/5 only because the nights we stayed this past week, the A/C didn't fully cool down our room at night. We would wake up throughout the night feeling very hot even though the A/C was on high and the lowest it would be. I guess this was an issue with the placement of the vents. One night, upon our return to the room, we noticed a small puddle of water below a access panel on the ceiling. The engineer came right away to fix…"
March 2019,Superior Hotel,"I was reluctant to review the Hari because I’m selfish and don’t want anyone to know how great it is but decided it would be a universal wrong to withhold this information.  It’s become difficult to parse out good and bad hotel options online, especially with social media framing.  Every property claims to have excellent amenities, be in “happening” neighborhood and have a luxurious finish-out.  I stayed over 2 stops, 6 nights total on a solo trip to London.  I’d like to move in there, but I have annoying obligations in the States.  Below, a rundown of why I love the Hari and why I’ll have to be back in London sooner than expected.  For starters, the staff were genuinely attentive and friendly.  Every person I interacted with seemed to be making sure I was enjoying myself and…"
March 2019,Great birthday weekend with friends,"Fabulous to be back at the Hari, with friends to celebrate a birthday... we had a full on weekend but it was great to return to the hotel bar at the end of the day for the vibes and ambience. its an Amazing location, so near Harrods and lots of boutiques, in a quiet area."
March 2019,Excellent hotel,"More than expected not the first time  , amazing hotel in London modern & classy the staff are friendly treat you like your family , nearby for every thing . thanks alot the hari team cant wait to come again and again ♥️♥️"
March 2019,What an amazing hotel,"Just got back from a one night stay at this gorgeous hotel. We loved everything about it. The staff were so friendly and helpful and couldn’t do enough for you. They made you feel special and welcome. The decor was stunning, unique and eclectic. Our room was lovely, bed super comfy and lovely sunny window seat overlooking some gardens. The bar was great aswell, really comfy and chilled. Loved it."
May 2019,What a gem!,"The Hari delivers on all counts.  Perfect location for exploring London, delicious food at Il Pampero, very comfortable rooms -  ours had an amazing view over Chesham Place gardens - the friendliest and most helpful staff and .... it smells so good!!!!  The terrace is fabulous in all it’s floral glory and the lounge/bar area just the right place for an early evening Bellini!  Our only regret was not staying for longer.  We hope to be back again soon."
April 2019,"Gorgeous Hotel, Exceptional Service, Great Location","This hotel is simply stunning. It had a perfect mix of old-world charm and modern style. The restaurant is gorgeous and the food and drinks were sublime. The location makes it easy to explore London. However, what made our experience truly exceptional was the staff--they provided superlative service on par with hotels that are 2-3 times the price. While this hotel is not inexpensive, I felt that we got fantastic value for our dollar here. Would happily stay again and would highly recommend it to others. My only (tiny) issue is that the rooms don't have a lot of overhead lighting so when getting ready at night it was a bit dark in the room. During the day, the beautiful windows let in tons of natural light. Overall, an exceptional experience. "
April 2019,Sofisticated London Hotel🌟,My husband and I stayed 4 nights at this wonderful hotel in beautiful Belgravia. Close to Sloane Square and Harrods. We agreed it was the best service and ambience.  The room we had on the 8 floor had a great London city view.  We will absolutely come back to this sofisticated hotel. 
April 2019,Great Belgravia location and surprising space,"My wife and I had a lovely Easter weekend stay here. The hotel was new to us, but we loved the decor and the friendly staff on arrival. We found the single most impressive aspect of the hotel was easily the size of the rooms. For this location and pricing, the rooms were a great size, with lovely, well laid bathrooms, great amenities in room, and also for our room, a small balcony with rooftop views of London. This was very special and was certainly quite different to other hotels in the area. The Easter egg on arrival from Guest Relations was an awesome personal touch that wasn't even thought of. That's the mark of a well staffed hotel that puts surprising and delighting at the forefront.  Il Pampero was great for breakfast (definitely try one of the Eggs Benedict style…"
April 2019,Weekend in London,"I’m a usual client of this amazing Hitel , I like the mood , the quality and the location of the Hotel . Staff is incredibly kind and friendly , the rooms are not big but very well curated . The food is good and the bath products are of high quality . For sure it’s my Hotel in London ! "
April 2019,Comfort and Service in Belgravia,"With a great location for shopping and dining, The Hari is quietly tucked into Belgravia. Hotel service is excellent as is the restaurant, Il Pampero: try the salt-baked fish. The cozy rooms have very comfortable beds however, there is little room for other than sleeping; the Lounge on the first floor offers space to read and have a quiet cup of tea. "
April 2019,"A great place to stay in Belgravia, London","This hotel was welcoming from the beginning the staff was great, the room very comfortable, the bathroom products were awesome and it was so nice to have a surprise treat in the room every evening. I would definitely stay again in this hotel."
April 2019,"Cozy, boutique in great locstion","Friendly staff, cozy accommodations, great location, comfortable rooms with nice views and much more! I will definitely be coming back.  Centric location, quiet neighborhood but close to nice shops and good restaurants."
April 2019,A true gem in the heart of Knightsbridge ,"Wow. Second visit to The Hari this year for work and I am incredible impressed. Property is a true gem, a lot of attention to design and details. Rooms are large, comfortable with big windows (cute window seating area on my first visit and a open view of London from the ninth floor on my second one). Love the location in the heart of Knightsbridge, nice walk to Mayfair for meetings, close by to fantastic dining options and friends in Chelsea/South Kensington and just 5min to Harrods for last minute shopping. The staff is just delightful and goes out of their way to take care of you. They remembered my recent stay and had a variety of warm attentions which were noticed and appreciated. Will definitely come back!  I come to London about 8/10x per year for work. "
April 2019,Excellent in all aspects,This was our second stay at the Hari which turned out to be just excellent. The staff were very welcoming and helpful. They provided quality service while demonstrating professionalism throughout the stay. The food at the restaurant during dinner was very good following the suggestions of the maître d'hôte and the breakfast delicious. The personal touch added comfort and warmth to the stay. Overall excellent.
March 2019,A memorable birthday stay,"My girlfriend and I stayed at the Hari for one night after seeing a play in Westminster. The room was amazing, great views of the park from the bay window seats, gorgeous design overall and plenty of space. The staff were all attentive and charming, they couldn’t do enough to make sure we were happy.  My girlfriend had said it was my birthday when she booked and everyone seemed to know. From the moment we walked in I was being wished a happy birthday and we genuinely felt that they wanted to make sure our stay was special.  The continental buffet breakfast was perfect, loads of mini pastries, cold meats and cheese as well as fresh juice. There was always someone nearby topping up our drinks and making sure we had tried everything we wanted.  I’m very grateful to everyone at the…"
March 2019,Beautiful experience,"My boyfriend and I chose to stay at The Hari for his birthday weekend, we had been planning to visit for a while and I’m glad that this beautiful hotel lived up to our expectations.  The service from the moment you walk in the front door is impeccable, everyone is very polite and friendly. They can’t do enough to help you and make you feel welcome.   The interior is stunning and definitely can’t compare to anything else I have experienced before. It’s an intimate hotel which feels cosy but luxurious at the same time. We didn’t have time to experience the terrace bar, but I imagine that would be lovely during summer.   The luxurious feel continued into the room, everything was spotless and well presented. The bathrooms are certainly unique! We also loved the seating area in the…"
March 2019,"Fantastic Hotel, Friendly Staff, Great Central Location",I had a marvelous stay at The Hari.  Already looking forward to staying again.  The staff is excellent and the location is ideal and is within walking distance of Hyde Park (fantastic for running) and the Knightsbridge and Sloan Square Underground stops.  The concierge Violetta B. was particularly kind and helpful.  Highly recommended.
March 2019,Perfect location in tranquil Belgravia. Wonderful staff,There are so many hotels to choose from in London it’s hard to stand out. However The Hari is everything you expect from a five star hotel without being pretentious. It was perfectly located for an evening stroll to Michelin star restaurants and five minutes from Sloane St and all the Knightsbridge shops. It is the staff who are possibly the hotels greatest asset and James in the first floor bar area deserves a special mention for going the extra mile when it comes to customer service.
March 2019,Wow o wow ,"I have nothing but compliments for this beautiful hotel. Me and my partner went for our anniversary and wow o wow did they make it a special one! From the minute we arrived our bags were taken straight from us and a lovely receptionist was ready to great us. As it was our anniversary they laid out confetti, swan towels, chocolate strawberry’s and a bottle of Champaign! The rooms are very big with a beautiful view ! The bath room was also very specials. The attention to detail is incredible. Thank you to everyone at The Hari for a beautiful stay to remember x"
February 2019,Feels like u are among family,"I have stayed at The Hari couple of times before and decided to do it again this February while visiting my daughter who is studying in London. The location of the hotel is fantastic and is close to two different tube stations , plus it is a walking distance to main fancy shopping streets . I love their breakfast area , where no matter how grey the weather , it’s cozy and bright with its big Resturant windows . Their rooms may not  be the biggest but again they are very bright with their cozy box windows. I had a problem with my mattress and the front office quickly took care of it and sent me a nice goodie treat as an apology . It’s a small Hotel and in no time u feel when u are greeted by the staff that they know you personally  . I was supposed to stay there for 5 days but I…"
April 2019,Great stay :):):),"We came at the Hari Hotel with my wife just for a few days and our stay was amazing! Totally relaxing, with a modern design and a homey atmosphere!  Restaurant Il Pampero was a beautiful spot for dinner with delicious food and lovely deserts! :)"
April 2019,That would be my new home hotel,"It was a very quick decision taken to have a nice escapade to london and i was so happy to land in such a fabulous hotel. A nice cosy modern fabulously well located nicely priced hotel. The room was small but we were lucky to be on the 10th floor and so the view was fabulous. The staff is very friendly. The room service is so quick.  They’ve left us a mobile phone in the room to use for all phone calls local and international, internet etc.. so no need to get a uk number. That was really a fascinating idea, it was definitely very useful. I am so excited to visit london again and again as i have a new home there now."
April 2019,Best night sleep I have ever had.,"I can honestly say I have never slept better. The room was silent, the bed incredibly comfortable and the sheets luxurious. Was very hard to get out of bed. Great atmosphere in the hotel and a lovely welcoming team. We got extra perks for booking direct too. The bar was very busy so may want to try and book in advance if you can. Will certainly come back. I can’t recommend this hotel enough."
April 2019,"Great stay at the Hari Hotel, London","I stayed with my girlfriend for one night at the Hari in London.  The hotel is very well decorated throughout with great decor and furnishings.  The atmosphere was cosy and welcoming, which is why I normally book boutique style hotels.  We staying for a special celebration and the staff were incredibly welcoming and helped me arrange some extra surprises in the room for our arrival."
April 2019,"The Hari Hotel, London",Amazing and friendly staff  Thanks for the warm welcoming and for the rapid arrangements  Comfortable beds& clean rooms  Thanks for the goodbye Latte ☕️ Definitely will be back again next time in London 👍🏻👍🏻
March 2019,Great hotel,"The Hari is a great boutique hotel in a nice, quiet neighborhood in London.  We've stayed there a few times.  The hotel is quite convenient to explore central London.  The staff is very professional and attentive, rooms are very well maintained, and you can get a good night sleep, as the hotel is quiet and beds are very comfortable.  I would say that the hotel was a distinct character.  Great value overall."
March 2019,Best trip ever!!,"A friend was traveling with me and this what she had to say... ""On my first visit to London I cannot think of a better experience than making our home base The Hari.  The location was perfect; quiet and close to most all sites in Central London. Upon arrival and our first experience with the bellman we knew this was going to be a great hotel. The staff was superb!  Their dedication to making our stay enjoyable, comfortable, and accommodating far exceeded our expectations!  Their smiles were infectious and always welcoming. Thank you The Hari and hats off to you for a fabulous 1st visit to London and we will see you again!! We highly recommend it ~~ you will surely not regret it!"" In addition I'll say: The Hari was the prefect hotel for a perfect trip. I look forward to my next…"
April 2019,Great night at the Hari,We had a lovely stay at the Hari. The front desk staff were all very helpful and friendly and made our stay feel very special with lovely personal touches in the room for us.  Breakfast buffet was to a high standard and set in a calm and relaxing atmosphere.  We will be back very soon.  
April 2019,Perfect,"We have just returned from a two night stay at The Hari for my fiancé’s 30th Birthday. The whole experience was perfect, from the rooms to the service and the personal touches they provided to help us celebrate the special occasion. Excellent location, close to the tube, in a lovely area of London. Cannot fault it. We will definitely be returning. "
March 2019,The Fantastic Hari Hotel,"We stayed at the Hari for the weekend to celebrate Mothers Day with my 5 year old daughter. We had a fabulous time, enjoying the great location, beautiful interiors, fab food and wonderful customer service that The Hari has to offer. The hotel is only a ten minute walk to Harrods and lots of beautiful cafe’s & restaurants, so the location was really convenient for us.  Overall a perfect weekend, that was really topped off with some of the best customer service we’ve ever received in a London hotel. They made my daughter in particular feel very welcome and seemed to really embrace having families and children in the hotel which in London is not always the case. They even included us in an Easter egg hunt which was totally unexpected and much to my daughters delight! We will…"
March 2019,Great service with friendly staff and fantastic location,"Great hotel with super friendly staff and cool common areas. Room was slightly ""chipped in the corners"" - could need a freshener. However I was staying in a ""basic"" room, but still.  Beautiful lobby and chillout areas, and staff was detail-oriented but still zero fuss. Overall a great experience"
March 2019,Amazing experience,Overall experience was amazing from the time we arrived until our departure staff went above and beyond for us. We will be returning. They have everything possible you could need int the room. Food was lovely. 
March 2019,Lovely Boutique Hotel. Excellent Location. Outstanding Staff.,"This is an excellent hotel in a very nice neighborhood (Belgravia). We stayed in a nicely appointed king sized room for 2 nights, a break in our journey from California to North Africa.   For us, what set this hotel apart were the little things.   Right after we checked in, they had a complimentary pot of fresh coffee and hot milk delivered ASAP to the room. Very welcome after a long flight!  Also notable: they will deliver milk for the in-room coffee setup any time of day or night, free of charge. The day we left (early flight), we called at 5am and it was there in under 5 min.  The location is terrific. It's very easy to get Ubers or London cabs (often parked right in front). The West End and Soho are about 2-3 miles east, and Kensington is about 2 miles west, 15-20 min drive…"
March 2019,Excellent Hotel ,"Had a lovely stay with my daughter in a twin premium room. Great service, lovely large beds and beautiful bay window looking out onto the garden square below. Enjoyed our beautiful dinner and breakfast at ll Pampero. Looking forward to staying again in the future."
March 2019,Beautiful hotel with friendly and helpful staff,"On a Girl’s Trip, we stayed one night at The Hari as a side trip to our vacation to Paris. We were able to check in early which was a welcome opportunity as we were weary from travel.  Our room was elegant, clean,and spacious with a lovely view of the neighborhood from the comfy window seat. After a short nap, we walked the beautiful surrounding neighborhood and found great shopping on Beauchamp Place. We had a delicious Italian dinner at Il Pampero in the hotel and all of the staff were very understanding of our time constraints as were going to a play that night. The valet even had a cab waiting following our meal so we could get there on time.  Everyone at The Hari was wonderful, friendly and accommodating.  It is a hip, fashionable hotel without being austere or snobbish.  I…"
March 2019,Mr,"Excellent service, excellent food, the bar is very cozy and nice, Italian restaurant is top quality and service, room is very very clean, spacious, also there is an Android portable device in the room with access to internet and a phone number that you can use during your stay . I will definitely stay in the hari during my next visit to london"
March 2019,Wonderful and cosy hotel in the perfect spot,"The Hari is an extremely cosy hotel with very friendly staff and nice rooms and great service. It is perfectly situated in a quiet spot and still right in the middle of everything with village-like Chelsea just around the corner, Satchi Gallery, Harrods, 15 min. walk to Mayfair and Marylebone, just around the corner from Hyde Park."
March 2019,Basically good but needs professional improvement,"Changed rooms three times for various reasons air-conditioning doesn’t work in one, Next one smells of smoke although  the hotel has no smoking policy. I must add that I found the staff to be extremely helpful when dealing with all the problems I think the problem is that it really is quite an old hotel which has changed names a couple of times and the infrastructure behind-the-scenes is pretty old.  One big plus is the  Italian restaurant, the food was superb far beyond my expectations and if you’re looking for a great Italian meal in London this is the place ."
March 2019,Fabulous Hotel,"I had a wonderful 2 night stay at The Hari. It is a superb hotel in a great location with extremely friendly staff, starting with the lovely Carlo who checked me in. The room was calm and tranquil with a lovely seating area under the window, an extremely comfortable bed and the bathroom had a true power shower. I drank in the bar which has a great vibe, with delicious drinks being prepared by barman Michael, and have in the past enjoyed an excellent meal in Il Pampero. I couldn’t recommend this hotel more highly."
October 2018,So Charming,"A boutique hotel in a lovely part of London, the Hari is quiet and plush. It all felt very decadent with the interior stylings of the lobby and the room itself, which had a big comfy bed and a luxurious bathroom. One thing to note is that there is a huge glass window from the bedroom into the bathroom with no blind etc to pull down, so you can literally see into the shower. Bit awkward when you are travelling with a friend, however the very attentive hotel staff arranged to have a curtain put up. We stayed for two nights and loved it!"
January 2019,Excellent hotel,"I stayed in The Hari in January 2019, the location couldnt be better, near Harvey Nichols,  the V&A, knightsbridge, convenient and accessible tube stations nearby. Also, close by Pavillion road which has been transformed. Very friendly and efficient team."
January 2019,Good Location,"The hotel was warm and friendly. This is by no means a large hotel, a comfortable boutique place, well located just behind Harvey Nichols and walking distance to Harrods. The rooms were quite small (we changed from the 1st we were given as it was right opposite the lift). Both were small with odd placed bathrooms. The 2 main nagging issues were that although there were 2 lifts, only one was ever operational. We also booked breakfast in bed. This was well below a 5 star standard. Everything was either over fried, under cooked or cold. We opted to have breakfast outside on our second morning"
January 2019,Great hotel with amazing service,"The hotel was in a very good location and the service across the board was amazing from the front desk reception to the concierge, and the gentlemen who greet you at the entrance. Room was a  bit small but the service more than made up for it."
January 2019,Such a nice weekend,We spent 3 perfect days at the Hari. Our room with view ont the park was incredible (big favorite for the marble bathroom). Thank you to the staff of the Hari for all the kind attention. They made my break during this weekend. I hope to come back very soon. 
January 2019,A magical weekend in London,"I recently stayed at The Hari as party of a girls weekend in London. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, we were made to feel important and special. We were greatened warmly by the staff at all times throughout the Hotel. Our room was simply stunning, with breaking views over the London skyline. We ate breakfast at the Il Pampero restaurant and were presently surprised at the value of money of the À la carte menu, which set us up nicely for a day shopping in London. We finished the day in the terrace bar, a relaxing way to unwind after a night out. I ended our stay with plans to return with my Husband as soon as possible. A truly magical weekend away."
January 2019,The best in London (Second Visit),"we booked from 1st January to 11 January 2019.  This time is the second time for us to go for the Hari hotel. you can check my previous review about the hotel, here is the additional one. i can say that the hotel is one of the best in London in location, security, staff, cleanness, and value of money for everything ! it is really worthy to pay it when you plan to go for London.   The staff from A to Z are really amazing, helpful and friendly. They helped us with every single inquiry we asked for ! location is just by walk to everything you want ! pharmacy, market, restaurants, Harrods Hyde park ... etc.   Thank you for making our vacation amazing for second time.   Muhannad Abudaoud"
January 2019,Amazing hotel,I travel the world and I can say this boutique hotel is a must. Very good quality price. Amazing mattress. Marble barthroom. A great atmosphere with a concierge and a bar. The only think that could be improved is the quality of the breakfast. All the rest is perfect. 
January 2019,Break from the kids,We found the Hari to be well placed for key attractions around London. The rooms were clean and the beds extremely comfortable. The staff throughout were very friendly and helpful. The food was also of a very high standard. 
August 2018,So happy,I was so happy to stay in this hotel they had a very good service and relaxing time! Good Location. Very sequire. Sabrina was very helpful! Thank you to the Hari hôtel team and I’ll visit again for sure!!! Specially SABRINA THANK YOU!!!!!
January 2019,Boutique Gem w/ Best London location & Italian cuisine,"The Hari did not disappoint!! You could not find a team more gracious and professional. I loved the room decor (wood & marble flooring) and safe, stocked mini bar..... all the 5 star amenities. The second floor lounge is huge! Lots of room & work space for a biz traveler. And restaurant is gorgeous & exceptional. Lighting in room could be enhanced just a touch, but minor as huge windows let in lots of natural light :)  Enjoy!!"
March 2019,Simply Brilliant!,"What a great choise! The stay at the hotel could not have been better. The decoration is super cute and cozy, that makes you feel at home. But the best is the lovely staff they have. Thanks for treating us so well, especially Vitorio, Gabrielle, Leo, Zi and Ricardo."
March 2019,"Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant","I can’t rate The Hari highly enough! Fantastic location, great environment and Ben Malpass (Manager) and his team are so professional - nothing is too hard for them. Extremely friendly crew. Loved our stay & will most definitely return. Loved every minute!"
March 2019,Short stay in London,"A great place to visit the museums nearby. The food and atmosphere at the Pampero restaurant was great, great service! The buffet breakfast could be a bit better but overall a great place to enjoy London!"
March 2019,Fantastic Stay at Relaxing Hotel!,"The Hari is quiet, chic understated elegance.  Rooms (though small) are beautifully appointed, staff was courteous and kind, room service food was delicious and not overpriced.  Lovely central location in Mayfair area, slight caveat is that not a ton of handy food shops/drug stores right outside door but really not that far of a walk to get it. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.  Had a great, relaxing time!"
March 2019,Perfection!,"This is a long overdue review and sometimes we are all guilty of taking the most important and beautiful things in life for granted.  As long term customers of the Hari Hotel, we have seen the hotel, bar and restaurant go through many changes.  Today, the Hari is the best venue in London for anyone seeking a boutique and intimate experience. May it be a business meeting, special occasion or just a spontaneous visit - you will love it!  We’d like to thank some special people that make this venue the best, firstly in the hotel bar, Vanessa, who was a waitress and has now risen to become a deputy bar manager - simply amazing! Vanessa makes everyone feel at ease and at home.  Under the leadership of James (who is the boss in the bar and the best we’ve ever seen), lovely people like…"
March 2019,My Favorite Hotel In London,"It was my first time staying in The Hari Hotel and definitely not my last time for sure. I was in business trip in London and I stayed at the Hari Hotel for 5 days, and I must say that everything was excellent. The Hotel Location is amasing, walking to Harrods and many other fancy stores for shopping. The Hotel staff were so friendly and totally amazing from the door man to the managers. Sabrine, was the front desk receptionist and she went the extra mile to make sure that I stayed in the room that I loved with great view. Alex, the manager was so  humble enough to make sure that I enjoyed my stay at the hotel. I ordered couple room service and the food was in my room after 15 minutes which super quick for such a busy Hotel.  Not sure when I am going back to London but I am 100%…"
February 2019,A Magnificent Hotel and Experience,"Upon arrival, you’re greeted by the kind and welcoming team at The Hari. The hotel has a lovely scent in the air, beautiful artwork and furniture with a cool, yet warm vibe. Each staff member is kind and helpful, willing to explain in detail - travel, museum, restaurant and tour tips. I have never experienced, in my extensive travels, a hotel staff extending themselves far beyond the norm to ensure a superior and pleasant stay. Wonderful! "
February 2019,Best night in London,"Arrived at a super nice clean room. Very stylish interior. Easy check-in, attention to details. No waiting time.  Left for meetings during the day, arrived back late night. Room prepared for the night. Chilled water and what not. Will come back soonest."
March 2018,I love this place!,"This is an amazing hotel. Excellent rooms, super comfy beds, and friendly and amenable staff.Whats more the location could not be better. One of my favourites. Not cheap - but this is Knightsbridge!  I was given a complementary bottle of champagne on my last visit - but I cannot recall why. Anyhow I was flying the following morning, so it is on ice awaiting my next visit.  Quite informal for a 5 star hotel, but that suits me perfectly. Bar and restaurant fabulous, very easy to strike up conversations with staff and other guests, just to make you feel more at home. "
October 2018,Two night stay,"Staff very efficient and friendly,  Rooms were very comfortable &!well equipped.  We dined in te restaurant & had a very nice meal . Again the staff were very attentive but discreet.  Had a most enjoyable stay"
February 2019,Very nice hotel,"A very pleasant hotel, just the right size, ideally located in a quiet part of Belgravia, yet 5 min walk to Knightsbridge. Staff very pleasant, food very good. You are welcomed with champagne. Highly recommended."
February 2019,Best of British,"We booked 2 rooms from Australia one evening.  The reception/booking staff were extremely obliging and helpful.  On arrival feeling tired from the trip, the doorman whisked our bags away and gave us a generous welcome.  This continued through to checkin.  As we had limited time in London we asked for directions to Harrods immediately which was literally minutes away.  When we returned after several hours the staff observed our tiredness.  Insisting on a cup of tea being sent to our rooms.   We were treated like royalty.  Being two 65+ yo women this is quite rare.  The rooms once we entered were luxurious, modern and warm both in temperature and ambience.  I would not hesitate in recommending The Hari to any form of visitor and would give it a 10+ for every aspect possible in a…"
February 2019,Enjoyed our stay,We had a good feeling walking into the hotel and you could see the staff had been well selected and motivated. Room was clean and comfortable and we slept very well. There is a very relaxed feeling in the hotel and warm decor. My wife was very happy with the hotel and we will definitely use again.
February 2019,"""I like""","Located between numerous embassies in Belgravia just off the leafy Cadogan and Eaton squares, this small personable 5 star hotel delivers. Only a 10 minute walk from Knightsbridge and 20 to Victoria station. Very attentive personable service across the board: reception, concierge, etc. Modern rooms with good amenities, 24/7 well equipped gym, and great bar on mezzanine level round things out."
February 2019,W😍W - and then some,"Dear Reader - Dear fellow traveller,   Are you in urgent need of some highend - potent luxury and service on the Upper Level.   Then please do not cheat Yourself, The Hari located in the Prime area of London, can meet Your every desire, while placing Your well being higher then anything.!

In short terms this is a must try experience in London, the concierge and front desk etc., will assist You with whatever desire You might have and the pleasure is, this is in their nature.   Bon Voyage and do not miss Out 🙏🏻"
September 2018,THE ENGLISH KNOW HOW,We appreciated the discreet and very professionnal staff and very nice welcome we had during our stay in the Hari Hotel. The location was perfect in a very nice and calm area. the room was perfect and service as well. The only weak point I would underline is at breakfast. The person in charge of the restaurant often forgot our order and we had to remind her what we had asked for. The staff at the bar was extremely nice and we really enjoyed our stay in your establisment.
September 2018,Absolutely stunning,"We had an amazing stay for our anniversary from start to finish was suburb! The service, food all incredible.  rooms very clean! It’s so close to so many wonderful bars pubs restaurants and as central as you could be in London, will definitely be returning!"
March 2019,Best boutique hotel in London,"Best boutique hotel in London. Nice area, safe and relaxing. Multiple high end shops and cafes nearby. In middle of London. Friendly staff with attention to details in rooms, lobby everywhere. Will stay again for sure !"
February 2019,An amazing night at the Hari,"Wow, what a beautiful gem - so pleased we choose The Hari to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  From the moment we stepped into the hotel -to departure the staff went over and above to make sure we had the best experience.  The room was beautiful, views across london stunning and all the added details of the hotel very much appreciated.  It is in such a perfect location too.  Thank you to the team at The Hari."
February 2019,Family Birthday ,"Hi Just had an amazing weekend at The Hari, celebrating a family birthday.  Could not fault anything staff, rooms, food, location all five star and great.

February 2019,Excellent,"A very nice and luxury hotel in Belgravia with a stunning friendly and supporting staff. Great rooms and first class breakfast. Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace and some very fine restaurants are just around the corner."
March 2018,Excellent rooms and excellent service,"Relliable good old fashioned British hospitality. The room service as well as the staff´s attention where always over the top, location is posh and so is everything they have to offer. Doesn´t let down your expectations"
September 2018,Excellent service in a modern boutique hotel,We stayed in the Hari for one night during a theatre trip to London for my wife’s birthday. A warm welcome before arriving in our very comfortable room with a nice view. Small details were nice to experience and the service from all members of staff was excellent and with genuine enthusiasm. Would stay there again in a heartbeat. Thank you Giuseppe and the team.
September 2018,Fantastic ,"I’ve been staying at the Hari during business trips off and on for over two years. I can’t say enough about this place. The restaurant, room and bar are top notch and the staff are absolutely AMAZING! Highly recommend it!!!!   Ps. The pic is of a gift (a book) and a handwritten note by the staff celebrating our second “Hari-versary”... just a nice personal touch that you’d never see nowadays!"
September 2018,My home in London,Homely feeling friendly well trained flexible efficient team members from arrival at door step to check in - beautifully appointed accommodation with amazing bathroom and shower room comfortable king size bed very good Italian food great choice of breakfast items top amenities did not want to leave!
September 2018,Afra,Nice hotel near to Harrods and all nice restaurants. 9 min walk to Hyde park. Clean nice and you will feel home. The single room is too small so it’s for one person and cannot take another one. I’m planning to stay again on it for my next trip.
September 2018,An example to hotels everywhere on how to do it right!,I always recommend the Hari when anyone is looking for an excellent hotel in London.   I absolutely adore this hotel. The decor is gorgeous. Every amenity is to hand. The location is amazing. They do a really good breakfast and the bar is atmospheric and does a great cocktail. What is exceptional about this hotel though is the staff. From the front desk to the restaurant and bar the customer care is second to none.   In this  instance I have to particularly mention the Concierge team ... Ben and Diego. I left a gift at reception and had to arrange to have it sent on to me. I had an issue  with the courier afterwards. I always think the best way to judge customer care is when there is a problem. They were extremely mannerly and efficient in dealing with my issue and had it…
September 2018,Wonderful!,"I booked for a birthday treat for my partner and we had a great night, loved the boutique feel of the hotel and even more so the friendliness of all the staff. The room & location is great too - on a quiet street but eay access to the shops and restaurants. The birthday brownies and fizz in our room just made it for us. Thanks too all at the Hari for making it a great night - we would love to come back, definitely a hotel with personality!"
August 2018,a week in london,"lovely, cozy upscale hotel for those who like a smaller hotel. Staff is very kind and helpful, always going the extra step to make you feel home and comfortable. location is great, very central and close to everything, either by foot, cab or tube "
September 2018,A gem,"worth a visit, close to the tube and of course Harrods. The staff are excellent, food in the italian restaurant is to die for. Decor is modern and eye catching. The bar is a nice spot to relax after a long day!"
November 2018,A Very Pleasant Stay,"The hotel is perfectly located on a quiet street. It is walking distant to Harrods, which was perfect for our last minute shopping and souvenirs. The bed was very comfortable. The breakfast included with the room was very good. The best part about our stay was the service. The staffs were amazingly attentive. Hats off to the team for the amazing work! We will definitely go back if we find ourselves in London again!"
November 2018,Wonderful,"We loved the room, the view, the breakfast... The staff were all so kind and helpful... Best stay of our lives, peaceful, quiet and romantic We recommend this beautiful hotel and will definetly be back soon ..."
November 2018,The ideal hotel for a weekend in London,Absolutely loved my stay at The Hari Hotel. The staff was very helpful. Breakfast was very nice and the bedroom had a lovely view. Everything was perfect and I highly recommend the Hari for a lovely stay in London!
November 2018,so nice,i ve been several time in this hotel room perfect size is ok and equipment is good staff very kind wonderful place to move around close to victorian station (gatwick express) close to many restaurants and bars  perfect stay
November 2018,An amazing experience in a great location,"We spent three nights at The Hari at the beginning of a month long Europe/UK holiday. What an absolutely wonderful place to start!  Hotel prices in London have always been expensive but now seem to be truly eye-watering. It took us a while to decide where to stay and we were persuaded by the great reviews of The Hari. Although still expensive, The Hari offers so much value.   We booked a King Premium room which was located on the 8th floor. The room was not spacious but so well designed and appointed, every need was catered for. We had a lovely outlook over the surrounding skyline. The bed was large and comfortable. The bathroom was small but with one of the best showers we've ever experienced in any hotel - spacious, marble-lined, overhead rain shower! And large, fluffy white…"
November 2018,Excellent Customer Service,"Loved this hotel and would definitely stay here again and I recommend to others. It has a boutique feel and the welcome felt genuine as if the staff were really pleased to see us. We had a private dinner for 20 in their private dining room off the bar, I don't know if there are others. It is a bit snug for 20 people but the food was lovely. Rooms are well thought out and the bed comfy. Well placed for shopping and leisure."
October 2018,Weekend at The Hari,I stayed here to meet family in London. Everyone was very welcoming and helpful. The breakfast was delicious and the view from the room was panoramic and very attractive. I would certainly recommend this hotel to others wishing to visit this very pleasant area in central London.
October 2018,Amazing Birthday Experience,"My daughter chose this hotel to stay at for her 14th birthday overnight and theatre treat.  She researched throroughtly and made a fantastic choice.  We told them when booking that it was for her birthday and upon entering the room we discovered cake, balloons and a card signed by members of staff - such a lovely welcome.  We hadn't organised anything for the afternoon because we weren't sure when we would arrive.  We got to the hotel early in the afternoon and, on our request, they recommended a variety of afternoon tea options with some in-depth knowledge.  Concierge immediately booked us into the Berkely Hotel.  That is worth another review, it was just the right mix of relaxed and stunning!  Upon our return there were chocolate brownies and a bottle of Champagne (for the…"
July 2018,Amazing experience & customer service,"We stayed here for husbands birthday during the summer months and I can’t fault it. It is a stunning hotel, well located for Knightsbridge and the surrounding areas. We were upgraded upon arrival and champagne and chocolates greeted us in our room since we were celebrating. We shall definitely be returning to The Haro on our next visit to London. "
October 2018,Great Stay,"My daughter and I stayed for 4 days. The staff worked hard but quietly to ensure our time at the Hari was perfect in every way. They even ascertained it was my birthday and surprised me with a lovely bottle of wine and tray of sweets. Very nice touch. The Hari is well located but in the quiet Belgravia neighborhood where we felt quite safe walking in the evenings on our own. The rooms are lovely and well maintained as is the entire property. Our room was on an upper floor facing the green where we had a distant but distinct view of St Pauls. Heaven. This is a small, very well run boutique hotel. If that is your thing, then this is the place for you."
December 2018,"Lovely hotel, excellent location ","We stayed in the Hari on a Saturday evening. The hotel location is perfect and we enjoyed excellent service, including drinks and snacks in the relaxed and luxurious bar. It is in walking distance to Harrods and the V&A. I had the best nights’ sleep I’d had in a long time and woke refreshed for heading on our holiday! Thank you Hari. - Dave and Helen"
February 2019,Tiny Room,"We thought that the location of the hotel was lovely.  It was surrounded by beautiful stores and still in a quiet neighborhood.  The rooms were absolutely tiny, however, for the price.  Yes, I do realize we were in Belgravia.  The hotel staff did accomodate us by removing the desk chair from the room so that midnight trips to the bathroom weren't toe removing!  The lobby and bar of the hotel are busy all times of day and night with business people and travelers enjoying a drink or having meetings.  This hotel was lovely and boutique, but probably just a little too tony for our taste!"
February 2019,Upscale tiny suites in great location,"The hotel is a real boutique hotel, nice decor, lower ceiling for my tall husband. Location is lovely. Good bedding and amenties nothing special but nice The star of this hotel is the italian restaurant. a plus many italian well educated staff."
December 2018,"Stylish hotel, excellent service","A very stylish yet cosy luxury hotel, with many thoughtful touches to make guests feel welcome. The personnel is very attentive, friendly and efficient. The location is excellent, mid-way between Knightsbridge and Sloane Square, in one of the most elegant areas of London."
February 2019,London at Christmas,"Located 5-10 min walk from Sloane square. Making it easy to get to a wide variety of restaurants.  Staff very welcoming and friendly, and obvious but low-key security at reception.  The rooms are a good size, but the bathroom is very spacious.  There is a hotel restaurant and bar, that looked lovely, but we did not use it."
January 2019,Wonderful Stay at The Hari,"Great hotel in an excellent location.  This hotel is in Belgravia area of London close to both the Sloan Square and Knightbridge Underground station.  It is a ~10 minute walk to Harrods.  The management, staff and concierge team were all so nice and helpful.  We are a family of five and got two interconnecting rooms with a separate, private outside door.  Great room setup for a family with three children.  The rooms were very nice with upgraded and posh finishes.  Belgravia is an upscale area of London with great restaurants and shopping.  Very easy to access the tourist sites in Central London either via Underground Subway or via Taxi."
December 2018,Amazing boutique hôtel,"My complete experience from check-in to check-out was a 10+!  I’m usually the one who has to change my room at least a couple of times before being satisfied. The room I had (just for myself), was perfect! My top faves: CLEAN, QUIET, WELL LIT, EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE FIRM BED (and pillows), EASY TO NAVIGATE THE ELECTRONICS AND LIGHTING.  The staff could it be more eager to assist. Great location."
December 2018,Stylish Hotel in Belgravia,"I stayed at the hari for 3 nights with my husband and baby son. The Hari is everything you want, great atmosphere amazing decor and spectacular service. The staff is so friendly and attends to all your requests with a smile. The food at Il Pampero is delicious too. Little advise for the room, their studio suites are spacious and very well appointed. I found my favorite place when in London. Thank you to the front office team for their little attentions. I will recommande The hari to all my friends!"
December 2018,Great Hotel! Wonderful service !,"The public area of the hotel is stylish and welcoming, and the check-in process was quick and straight forward.  I had booked a standard room, which was spacious - and the bathroom was well appointed, with lovely complimentary toiletries.  The duvets and pillows were heavenly, and made for a very good night's sleep!  We ate in Il Pompero restaurant, and although the service could have been more efficient, the food was delicious!  "
December 2018,Amazing drinks and dinner in a beautiful place,This hotel was an easy trip from the airport on the underground train/tube and we walked a few minutes to the hotel from the Knightsbridge stop. We were immediately helped with our bags and doors opened for us. The staff was very lovely and welcoming and they even offered us a complimentary drink upon arrival. The room had a great view and was pretty spacious as well as a cool interior design. We really enjoyed this hotel! Thanks Ricardo for being so welcoming after a long day of travel
December 2018,Lovely Staff,"We went for drinks and dinner to the Hari with friends. The place is beautiful, modern, cozy with a very nice atmosphere. The cocktails were perfect. The dinner was outstanding, both for the food and the service. Antipasti, pasta, meat, desserts: everything was delicious. I particularly recommend the incredible pasta prepared in a Parmesan wheel. We were delighted by a very efficient and high-quality service. Congratulations to the chef and his staff for this amazing experience. We will definitely come back with friends or family."
December 2018,"Lovely, but expensive, even for London","Our one night stay was nice enough with some lovely friendly staff on the door and reception.  Our room was smallish but comfortable and beautifully finished, and that really is theme across this stylish hotel.  We ate breakfast which was perfectly adequate but nothing special.  "
December 2018,"Fantastic, unique hotel!","Excellent location, very helpful staff, best hotel breakfast i have had in years.  And you've got to love their pet policy...  We were given a fantastic upgrade, but without it, this would have been very expensive even for London."
December 2018,Located 5-10 min walk from Sloane square,"We were visiting London for an evening event and staying at the Hari made our trip particularly special. It is a fantastic, unique hotel with great attention to detail. We were blown away by the care and thought displayed by staff. The design is beautiful. The beds are extremely comfortable - a good nights sleep! We highly recommend this hotel!  Thank you to all at the Hari, particularly Front Office Manager, Alex for making this trip extra special!"
November 2018,Fantastic!,"The staff were so friendly and helpful, and very welcoming. The welcome drink was a real treat! The rooms are a great size and very comfortable. Great hotel bar and breakfast room. The hotel is in a great location as well. Would absolutely recommend this hotel. "
February 2019,An excellent hotel in every way,"This hotel is well situated, comfortable, has an amazing relaxing environment, its quirky décor is refreshing change to the larger chain hotels. All the staff were fantastic and could not have done any more to make our stay more enjoyable."
January 2019,Stay Here,"Walking distance to just about everything and if not, the tube is a five minute walk away. Hotel bar was inviting with great cocktails and no rush if you needed a place to unwind. The staff was really accommodating so much so that we decided to extend our trip an extra day because the concierge insisted we visit a Dior exhibit at the V&A that was totally sold out, but the hotel had some tickets for purchase. Everyone was so friendly, how refreshing coming form the states. The rooms were very cozy and the bathrooms are fit for some IG selfies. Do yourself a favor and stay at The Hari."
February 2019,Perfect birthday experience,"I stayed here with friends to celebrate my birthday and I couldn’t fault a thing.  The team were very friendly and always very happy to help. Special thanks to Joanna, James and Hannah!   The location was perfect and I hope to come back soon!  Thanks again!"
January 2019,Special London Hotel gem...,"My third visit to the Hari. I like this hotel because of it's location, general atmosphere and the very personal attention you receive from the wonderful staff. Nothing is too much trouble & for weary business travellers this is exactly what is required. Very nice rooms, cozy bar & excellent breakfast.  Well done team Hari.. Bradley (NZ)"
January 2019,Amazing hotel on our first trip to London,"This was our first trip to London and staying at The Hari made our trip special. Since we arrived very early after a 5 hour flight, our room was not ready until around 1pm. We just strolled around Buckingham Palace and enjoyed the gorgeous architecture in Belgravia until we received a call from the staff saying our room is ready. Ricardo, the nicest bellhop ever, showed us our room and brought our luggage. He also explained that we can take the room's own Handy phone with us to explore the city. It had all the info on restaurants, sights and shops. Very cool and very helpful! The hotel was very stylish and cozy. The room was very up to date and had one of the nicest showers I have ever used. Every day we got two bottles of water and little sweet treats which was very thoughtful.…"
October 2018,Great stay,"Our stay at The Hari was great. Being our first trip to London, we didn't expect to spend too much time in the room. However, whenever we do travel, location is of utmost importance to us. The Hari is located in a great and safe area, but the walk to the nearest train stations aren't terrible, but it's not around the corner either. Rooms and bathrooms were clean, staff was very friendly and helpful. Cool story: My wife and I are expecting our first child, but didn't know the gender. We get a call from the ob 10minutes before we're supposed to board our flight saying that if we want to know, then call them back. We called back giving permission for the office to tell our friends. Our friends call The Hari asking if they'd be able to make a reveal cake for us. Our initial plan was…"
October 2018,Nice place,"Nice quiet street but still great location, nice restaurant in hotel and several more nearby. Small room as you would expect in London, very nice staff. Great bonus: you get a cell phone with free calls home and directions. "
October 2018,Perfect,Wonderful staff...great location..very cozy..higly recommend to all..only thing is I think they need harder beds but after all this a matter of selection of taste and need..I had also a friend who stayed also liked itThank u
October 2018,Best all round hotel in Knightsbridge,"Rooms are clean and modern, staff is very friendly and willing to help in restaurant reservations. Hotel also has an all day lounge for drinks and nibbles and of course one has to visit its amazing cigar lounge!"
October 2018,Short Leisure Travel trip to London,"The Hari in London is a fantastic hotel.  Amazing staff, decor, restaurant and location.   Italian restaurant is great, and the location, a 5 min walk to Harrods, is perfect. A perfect hotel that is in a good neighborhood and just far enough away from the hustle and bustle of one of Londons shopping districts."
October 2018,Fantastic 5 star bltel,"Stayed here for a couple of nights whilst I was in the area for business earlier this month. Quick check in, a lovely & helpful young lady checked me and made me feel very welcome. Very good sized room, with the bed lovely and clean. I didn’t eat at night here, but the breakfast was brilliant both days.  "
October 2018,Great Stay,Had a wonderful time at this hotel and was particularly impressed with the housekeeping. The staff was also very friendly and welcoming. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in London.
October 2018,Great experience,"The service and overall experience at The Hari were wonderful.  The staff went out of their way to take care of any needs and the rooms were spacious, beautiful and very clean.  Small touches like being addressed by name after the first day and homemade desserts at the front desk highlight their intention to make the whole trip wonderful.  The location was an easy walk to shopping, museums and multiple restaurant options.  We used the restaurant in the hotel for both a breakfast and a dinner, and would have gone back with the exception that we wanted to eat in different restaurants each night.  We would definitely go back to The Hari."
October 2018,Simply amazing stay. A+!!!,"Went for a 3 day family trip and I only have good words for the hotel and its staff. Incredible room, great views, amazing breakfast and dinner, super cozy crib + blanket for our 2 year old baby.  A+++!!"
October 2018,Great location,"Good, clean, friendly staff and a great location minutes away from all your main landmarks in London, the rooms size and service are excellent, expensive but that’s how it is in London highly recommend"
November 2018,Great boutique hotel,"This is what I call home when I am in London. The staff is always super friendly and very professional! The Italian restaurant in the ground floor and the bar in the 1st floor also good. The rooms are very nice, stylish and have wooden floors. You can open the windows which I love and  linens are super clean. I have stayed there for a 100 times and will continue to do so."
November 2018,Great boutique hotel in a nice location of London,"A few people from my company stayed at The Hari for several days while on business in London, and also used the hotel’s large meeting room during our stay. I found the style of the hotel very trendy yet pleasant and comfortable. The group events staff were excellent in helping us plan our stay in advance and also making sure everything went off without a hitch including catering our meeting room and making us feel very welcome. The rooms were slightly on the smallish side, but I think still typical of European hotels versus newer American hotels these days. Rooms were well taken care of daily by housekeeping. The location in the most fashionable part of London, a block from Sloane Street, was very neat and I enjoyed going for walks in the surrounding areas of…"
November 2018,Amazing Place! High Class Hotel,"This was a wonderful stay! The Hari is a high-class hotel in a swanky part of London (Belgravia). The rooms are a little tight, but the staff more than makes up for this with their attentiveness to all of your needs. I would absolutely come back here."
October 2018,Fabulous hotel,"I have been to The Hari several times and it never disappoints.  I can highly recommend the bar and cigar terrace it’s got a great atmosphere and “A” listers seem to be regular visitors.  The private dining room is fabulously well appointed and the food equally as good as in the main restaurant. I have eaten in both a few times, one of the best Italian restaurants in the area if not in London.  Can’t wait to go back.  Carol DJ  "
November 2018,Perlefelt location,"During the years I have visited London many times. This time I wasn’t disappointed with the hotel. On the contrary this is the best hotel I have stayed In London. Perfect location, friendly staff and a great restaurant. If you stay at the Hari, I recommend you visit this Italian restaurant. Very good food and wine. A great barman as well as a great head waiter in Stefano. My compliments to Ivan at the front text as well. Minor complications when we checked in that was sorted amicably."
November 2018,Anniversary Stay,"We stayed at The Hari in celebration of an overnight trip into London for our anniversary, and it did not disappoint.  Upon arrival, we were asked if we were celebrating anything special to which we told staff about it being our anniversary. Once we’d been shown to a beautiful room with a view, we were surprised by a bottle of Moat and homemade macaroons and biscuits. The staff were all very friendly and attentive to our needs. The only things I’d mark The Hari down on are the fact we were told we’d receive a call to the room when a table became available in the bar, but we didn’t receive a call so just had to sit in our room and order a drink. The bed was also a little hard and had a lump in the middle of it, but other than that the decor and staff were amazing and we would…"
November 2018,Lovely hotel in the best part of London,"Great location near tube, Harrods, Hyde Park and Sloane Street shopping area. The rooms are nicely decorated and ok in size. The staff is very kind and helpful from entering the hotel to the front desk."
November 2018,Modern elegance with perfect location,Perfectly located short walking distance from Hyde Park and also Chelsea and Knightsbridge shopping areas. Quite modern and costly with young friendly staff. Rooms are modern and comfortable but donnit have a lot of light. Rooms in higher floors have a great view as well.
November 2018,Amazing response to tricky situation - exactly what you'd hope for from a top-end hotel,"There was a problem with my booking that was not the fault of the hotel. On arrival, there was no booking for me, and I was left facing having to find another hotel late afternoon, about an hour ahead of an important business meeting.  After some investigation by the hotel, I was offered a drink and spoken with by Matthew Burbidge-Airs, the deputy general manager.  He explained what had happened and that we had both been the victim of an IT glitch.  Matthew then offered to accomodate me in a room of my choice, with no further charge. I was stunned at the hotel's wonderful approach and the sheer professional of the staff.  The hotel is very well-appointed and close to Knightsbridge, Buckingham Palace and Westminster.  My room on the 8th floor had a wonderful view across the…"
November 2018,A Wonderful Find!,"I initially chose this hotel due to its location and the fact that they had rooms with two beds.  I was traveling with a good friend and we wanted our own beds.  The staff was top notch and the concierge helped us make and cancel dinner reservations.  Upon our arrival, our room was not yet ready but the staff offered us beverages and told us that our room would be available ASAP.  We chose to head out to the V&A instead.  The hotel stored our bags and texted when our room was ready.  Upon our return, we were provided with keys and informed that our bags were already in our room.  Wonderful service.  The bar staff was friendly and fun to chat with.  The location is perfect to Harrods, the Tube, Sloane Street (excellent shopping) and to the V&A, my favorite museum.  It's in more…"
October 2018,Royal Parks Visit,Following a visit to the Royal Parks we went for lunch at the Hari. The restaurant is nicely decorated and has attentive staff with a pleasant discreet service. The food was exceptional we chose a selection of starters a selection of pastas and a selection of desserts which we all swapped and sampled each other’s all delicious. Highlight the hazelnut moose. If your in Kensington and Chelsea visit the Hari you will not be disappointed 
October 2018,The best service ever at a wonderful hotel and great location in London,"I recently spent 8 nights at the Hari for what was primarily a business trip. While I travel a lot, 8 nights in any hotel seems like a lot of time. But I happily could have spent even longer because of the wonderful service. The Hari itself is more a boutique hotel than anything, in a great part of London. It's an easy walk to the Victoria and Albert, Hyde Park, and even the National Gallery is only 1.5 miles away and a very pleasant walk in good weather. We were on the 4th floor facing a small park across the street and while we were on a busy street we heard nothing outside. The room was comfortable with a large window and sitting area and the hotel restaurant is very good. But it is the service which makes the Hari so special. From the moment you arrive you are made to feel…"
November 2017,Great hotel and first class experience (with added bonus of a good value),"Great hotel with friendly staff, adequate-sized rooms for a European hotel, a welcoming bar area, nice amenities, and a sophisticated feel. I don't know London incredibly well but the location felt like a balance between being enough removed to have some quiet if needed, but close enough to everything that you are still very much in the city. We loved it and would return.   Aside from a couple of caveats like the bar is a bit smokey from the cigar room nearby, and at the time we visited it was under a bit of construction, we had a fantastic time. Our only issue was making the mistake of taking the tube to the Stansted Express, which moved about as fast as a lazy cow. If you are going through Stansted, allow plenty of time to get there!"
October 2018,"Gorgeous Hotel, Quiet Location, Amazing Staff","We decided to end our UK trip by staying 5 nights at The Hari.  The hotel isn't huge, which is what drew us to stay here.    Location:  The location of this hotel was perfect for us.  A 10 min walk to Victoria station, which was nice and far enough away from being touristy.  It located in the middle of all of the Embassies.   The Hotel: Upon arrival, the door men insisted on taking our luggage for us, which was nice.  We got to the hotel very early and there wasn't a room for us yet, but they kept our luggage locked away until our room was ready.  We explored the hotel alittle and then left to grab some food.  We came back and our room was on the 6th floor overlooking the park.  It was perfect.  The room was clean and spacious.  We booked a Premium King Room. Super comfy bed,…"
October 2018,My london pad,We were greeted by name on arrival which amazes me when we hadn’t notified anyone of our time of arrival! Attentitive or what! The room was almost ready and we were offered drinks whilst we waited literally five minutes. This is suck a great location to Knightsbridge on the doorstep of Harrods ! 
October 2018,we came without a booking but still they accommodate us,"great restaurant we came announced but they gave us a table for one hours...good enough for us! food was fantastic, it is our third time there, service attentive but not too much. we definitely recommend this one. thanks for the table!!!"
September 2018,Great hotel,"Wonderful hotel, very welcoming and friendly, very generous too, i felt i was at home! The stuff speaks many languages, they are very helpful,and ready to fulfill any desire! I had a beautiful room with a great view!"
September 2018,Fantastic,"The best City Hotel I have ever stayed in a very, very long time. The service of the staff was top notch.  Perfect location with a short walk to the Underground (Victoria station or Knightsbridge Station).  Room was very clean and spacious (by London standards). Highly recommended."
September 2018,Home away from home,"Fantastic hotel, lovely cosy rooms, bed was so comfy and the staff were super friendly and helpful! I always stay at the jumeirah and in terms of service it’s incomparable! Stayed at The hari for 5days i enjoyed every bit of my stay, it really was a beautiful experience..."
September 2018,Outstanding experience ,"We cannot fault The Hari, from the moment we walked in to the moment we checked out it was simply fantastic. We arrived mid afternoon, got offered a complimentary glass of champagne which we enjoyed on the lovely sun terrace, got taken to our room to find that we had been given a free upgrade, and a beautiful birthday gift for my boyfriends 30th - Balloons, a bottle of Moët and some lovely brownies. The room was stunning, very clean and very elegant. We then carried our evening on evening to the Hawksmoors (a lovely steak restaurant around 15min wall from the hotel) then to the Royal Albert Hall which was only again around 15min from the hotel - excellent location! When we returned we found another!!!! Bottle of Moët from the hotel! We were so surprised we called to double check…"
July 2018,SO MANY HOTELS BUT WHY CHOOSE THE HARI,"There are hundreds of hotels to choose from in London but The Hari stands out for its location, its quality of accommodation, its house keeping but above all for the outstanding service from the whole team. The welcome, the attention to detail and the helpfulness from every member of the team. Highly recommended."
July 2018,This hotel is tops,"Cozy hotel in a convenient location. We picked this hotel because we wanted to stay close to Slone street for some shopping there. Our room is a premium king room which is of ok size, with stylish design. Bed is exceptionally comfortable. The only down size is the noise from the street, possibly because we are on the 2nd floor. We may still choose this hotel the next time we visit London but would definitely ask for a room on higher floors."
June 2018,"Wonderful Hotel, very charming staff, lovely stay!!","From the check-in to check-out the Hari had the nicest staff. At check-in the front desk person offered water, espresso and cookies immediately. The bell hop took our bags to the room with us and explained every little detail of the hotel and room. The concierge reserved a perfect place for us for both lunch and dinner. The bar staff where we had our afternoon rest stop was so friendly. The location of the Hari was very convenient and allowed us to walk to many of our destinations. Thanks to the Hari for a warm and welcoming stay!"
June 2018,Nice hotel but staff at check in was not very friendly,"Last week we have traveled for two days to London and we have stayed at the Hari Hotel. Privileged location for a pleasant walk through the Belgravia neighborhood and access on foot to the beautiful shops of Sloane Street and the most famous department stores in London. The hotel and all its spaces are tremendously welcoming and warm, the room very cozy, spacious and bright, full of nice details. The bed, one of the most comfortable that I have slept in all my life. In our case, we have had breakfast a la carte, delicious coffee and juice, pancakes and perfect eggs. One afternoon we have had a drink in the beautiful bar on the first floor, where there is also a very nice terrace. We have not had time to try the restaurant, of which we had very good references. And finally,…"
June 2018,Best night out with my friends ,"When we arrived at the hotel, the person at the front desk asked for our name. Before we even had time to reply, we were told we would have to give a print of our credit card just in case we had some extras.  We filled in the paperwork, were given a key and were sent on our way. The receptionist did not engage with us and we did not feel welcomed at all. We just felt she wanted to get rid of us asap!  The room was nice, spacious and well appointed. The only downside was the scaffolding we could see from the lounge window. Let's say that if you want a room with a view, this is not the place for you. The bed was extremely comfy. One of the best bed I ever slept in. The next morning, another receptionist checked us out. She was a lot more friendly than her colleague which made a…"
June 2018,Stylish but noisy,"Comfy bed and the best staff ever,notting is to much trouble...even a water bottle in the middle of the night. Dario and Bence was very nice to us even if they were very busy. Florina went over the top to arrange all of this for us. Thank you all for the best stay ever!"
July 2018,The amazing staff makes this a 5 star hotel,"I was looking for a modern hotel in a great area. The Hari was the perfect choice. Boutique hotel. Belgravia is a beautiful neighborhood. Close to everything. The staff is so friendly, professional and helpful. I’m sure all their business is repeat. Once you are there, you wouldn’t want to stay anywhere else. Oh and the hotel has great bikes you can ride around and see all the major sites. Shout out to Stefania, Estefano, Z, Matthias, Daniel, Ben, Diego, Nerius... all rockstars!"
July 2018,First time London visit ,"First time in my life to visit London. The location of the hotel is in Belgravia, where the nice and quiet neighborhood. I was told the neighborhood was one of the wealthiest residential area in the world. The hotel provides the rent bike service which allowed me to explore the neighborhood in the morning.  The location also is close to all famous tourist spots like Hyde park and Buckingham palace, Harrods....   The hotel public area and room was designed very chic and cozy. The bed was very comfortable and the bath was covered by stone tile. Clean and neat. The closet is all concealed in the hallway.  The only thing I would not pretty satisfied was the USB port. There was only one port in the room.   Overall I would recommend to stay with the Hari when visiting London."
May 2018,Intimate and stylish,"What a gem, tucked away in a fabulous location it’s stylish and intimate but with incredible service. The concierge couldn’t do enough to help but he was not intrusive in the slightest, all the staff were very helpful and the service was impeccable. The rooms were well thought out and there were some lovely touches; mobile phones in each room for the guests to use and they knew it was an anniversary stay so we had a surprise waiting in the room. We will most certainly be returning."
June 2018,As good as it gets,As good as it gets .....this hotel was an unexpected discovery. Perfect locality superb service . The hotel restaurant is Pampero and it is now my favorite Italian restaurant in London . This hotel in my eyes deserves to be number one for London hotels 
June 2018,Happy at this Hotel,"Decorated and maintained in flawless manner. From the bellboys to the maître d’, the staff was friendly, eager to assist, and most professional.  We appreciated the warm welcome to London from Petra.  Rooms are spacious and well appointed for settling in to a comfortable five night stay in the space. The turn down service is great. There was some outer scaffolding obstructing a bit of the view, but not to our distress. Breakfast ordered from the menu was a better choice than the buffet. Morning room service was prompt. The restaurant was a fine dining experience. Delicious food, good wine selection, expert wait staff, and charming chef all added to our evening at the il Pampero. There is every attempt to make your stay as enjoyable as possible! There are two close by Underground…"
June 2018,We’ll be back!!!,"Lovely modern and comfortable boutique hotel, very convenient to shopping and the restaurants in Knightbridge. The beds were truly “heavenly” and the bathrooms were spacious and luxurious. The photos on the hotel’s website do it justice. The bar is fabulous, too! We WILL be back!"
June 2018,Royal Ascot,Extremely comfortable delightful team of staff who couldn't do enough to help you enjoy your stay and our room although the view had a bit of scaffolding outside was so nice and immaculately clean throughout our stay. 
June 2018,Wedding celebrations!,"We’ve had the most amazing stay at the Hari!! We  booked to stay for our wedding celebration as our wedding was being held in Chelsea! Great location,stunning hotel!

March 2018,Good Memory in London,"It was my first and important time to have my special occasion with The Hari in London. The staff are very professional and friendly and thanks them giving us wonderful memory. Decoration is fancy and modern. Location at a special area with a lot of iembassy, also is convenient to Victoria station or The Harrods. We really enjoy walking there.  Another surprise is the view of our room, we are able to look London Eye every night. Thanks for The Hari."
June 2018,Wonderful hotel in beautiful Belgravia,"The Hari hotel is a must if you are in London. For me my new Favorit hotel when in London.  The hotel is very charming and intimate. The staff makes the different to all other hotels out there. They are so welcoming and friendly and so engaging, they know all when its time to chat and when not. The attention to detail was truly amazing. I had a wonderful time in Belgravia, you feel there like you do live in London. It is very central you can walk to Victoria station in just 10 minutes. Overall I loved The Hari.  "
June 2018,Exceptional ,"Upon arrival I was met with the warmest of welcomes by the reception staff. I was  staying at this hotel on my birthday & was made to feel really special, nothing was to  much trouble, the room was really nice & everything you  could’ve wanted was there.  The restaurant was a lovely dining experience, the food & service was superb. I would recommend this hotel & will return.  All the staff are very friendly & helpful. "
June 2018,Best boutique hotel in london,I enjoyed my stay very much.Location is great.  The staff were super friendly and efficient. I booked studio suite that has a bath tub with a view. Room cleanliness was impeccable and in house restaurant is very good as well.
June 2018,Good value,"My wife and I were first timers at The Hari, and we were pleasantly surprised. The location, an eight minute walk to Sloan Square or Knightsbridge, is excellent. The hotel has a clean modern feel, but perhaps in their quest to provide homeliness , made the rooms a little dark. Our room, London small, was nevertheless very comfortable and the shower, well, the best shower in the UK! Service was excellent."
September 2018,Perfection!,"Having stayed at the Hari many times now. The rooms are generous and well fitted, very clean and modern inside The Staff/ Team are a huge drawing point. Very well managed and thoughtful, you'll quickly get to know the whole team. Restaurant and bar are the same. Lovely food with friendly staff and reasonable pricing "
June 2018,Exceptional ,"We closed out our recent Europe trip with a stay at the Hari and couldn’t have been more pleased. This hotel is truly 5 stars! Comfortable beds, smartly designed rooms and attentive staff. Interior design features in the lobby and first floor bar are impressive. Dessert treats with turn down service are an added delight. This is our new go-to London hotel!"
May 2018,Quiet Perfection in Belgravia,"I stayed at the Hari for 6 nights.  Everything was exceptional.  The hotel is clean, stylish, and the service and staff are next level.  Will definitely stay here whenever I return to London, moving forward. "
June 2018,Outstanding service and comfort,"Stylish and quality hotel in upscale and quiet Belgravia, but still central. Easy access to three Underground lines. Restaurants shops and parks close by. Morning and evening strolls past diplomat cars and embassy fronts helped with the ambience. Ground floor restaurant is fantastic Italian, and the 1st floor bar is super mod cool. Friendly and helpful staff were abundant and always willing to help. Turn down service with water and treats is always fun. Our new go-to."
June 2018,So relaxe,"When booking the Hari do ask for room 308. Will accommodate the comfort needs of most egos. Chill in the plush comfort of a beautifully appointed but welcoming room with an amazing bed.   I returned to this property after finding an affordable deal on TripAdvisor and was so pleased with the high quality of service at the front desk and most importantly at the il Pampero Italian Bar and Restaurent  where Dario Amoroso made sure we had a super generous and delicious breakfast. It made our day.  The staff at this property could not have been more helpful, more pleasant and fabulously accommodating.  A must must try."
June 2018,Amazing hotel,My family were came and really enjoy for every single moments  Love the interior  Full of love  Full of togetherness  Wanna come back again again and again  Love travel around the worlds  Hope my family always enjoy and always create memorable experiences
May 2018,Best stay at a hotel.,Such an amazing hotel! We stayed in a beautiful room with a bathtub overlooking the park. We stayed on the night of our wedding and we were treated like royalty! The bar serves great cocktails and the breakfast was delicious! 
May 2018,Great hotel in Knightsbridge,"Stayed one night only, meeting family members from the USA. From the moment you walk into the hotel, the friendly doormen, Charlie at the front desk to an immaculate room, you will have to look far to find any fault. After a busy day and night out at the theater we had a late night light snack at the bar, only once again to be bowled over by an excellent bartender and wonderful recommendations regarding some of the Gin they stocked. This has been one the best hotels I have stayed in forty years of travelling, lovely location within reach of most major sites and very peaceful and quiet. In my opinion, when one is treated as the most important guest by all the staff, they deserve to get the best recommendation one can give."
May 2018,One of the best hotels in the heart of London!,"Fantastic stay, very comfortable and quiet room, immaculately clean and brilliant staff. Old fashioned service with a contemporary twist. Thoroughly recommended and a nice bar too. Brilliant base for Knightsbridge."
July 2017,"Superb hotel, one of the best boutique hotels in London","Excellent location, friendly and helpful staff, organic breakfast and traditional as well! The rooms are spacious, the design and colors wonderful, marble bathroom and comfortable bed for a good night rest! Piccadilly tube station is nearby, almost five minutes walk, close to Sloane  square as well!"
May 2018,Fantastic Hotel and Team,"I stayed here with my husband for his 40th birthday. Fantastic hotel, excellent location, staff couldn’t do enough for us yet were discreet. Special mention to Joanna in guest relations, Michael in the bar, Daniel the bellman who always had a smile on his face and the concierge who managed to get us a table for duck and waffle when we were unable to. The rooms are larger than we expected and very well appointed. Will definitely be returning soon. Thank you to all the staff at The Hari."
August 2018,Home in London,This is our go-to hotel in London. Very close to everything between Chelsea/Kensington/Mayfair. Staff are very friendly and helpful. The concierge service offers great tips and assistance. The Hari is a good balance between boutique and class.
August 2018,Amazing staff,"The staff made the stay x10 better. They were unbelievable with their manners. The rooms were very clean. What makes the hotel special is that they clean it twice a day, first to clean and the second to arrange the bed for sleeping. Nabeel, the bar manager was beyond perfect he was so helpful with finding us a table and very generous. "
September 2017,I’m in love with this place,"The hari is one of my most favorite hotels in london, very luxurious and classy hotel, and aaaahh don’t forget to try their doughnuts, the rooms were very cool too, cozy as hellll, and yes the housekeeping is cute;)"
August 2018,5 ⭐️ for the door man,"I been to Egyptian consulate to pick up my passport as I applied for visa and I realised I am quite early so, I decided to have a coffee in the meantime at The Hari. After waiting around 20 minutes, the gentleman on the door noticed that I haven’t got my coffee and he made it for me . It was the best coffee I ever had in my life and I am not joking. Thank you very much for that ( my apologies, I don’t know the gentleman’s name)."

July 2018,Friendly luxury at the Hari,Lovely stay at the Hari! Staff is extremely friendly and makes sure to great and meet us at every moment.  This is our second time there and we will be there for sure!!! Love handy the phone that the hotel provides and let’s not forget the bicycle a must with its basket!! Just love everything; the location as well as the amenities and amazing staff 😊
July 2018,Very Classic and Comfortable,"Located right in the hear of London, the amenities are terrific. Staff is very accommodating and friendly. View was not so good but I slept most of the time I was in my room. Great location to walk around."
July 2018,Merciful Hari,I had the best time and experience there not only the warm welcome but the magnificent humanity I have ever seen and ther wonderful stuff as they give you the impression of a queen the concierge is one of the best people I ever met in my life words can not say more about them our wish is their commands . Treating us and spoiling us is their aim .
July 2018,The Hari lounge,We had a really good night yesterday👍💜 .                                           The menu was awesome and prices were fair. Vanessa was very friendly and wonderful If I ever come back it will be because of her👌.  But I think that they should add more tables for the lounge and terrace.
July 2018,Lots of good things going for it but...,"I stayed at The Hari for 4 nights and overall enjoyed the stay and the very personable front desk and concierge staff. The location is fantastic! Our room on the 10th floor, though a bit small, was very, very well laid out and appointed, comfortable and quiet. The Italian restaurant, while mostly always empty was very good for dinner, both food and service.  Criticisms are as follows: - the bathroom lighting is quite awful if you're a woman trying to put make up on - one day, having left the hotel at 8 am, upon our return at 5 pm the room had not been made up. A call to the front desk elicited the response: ""We're very busy trying to get ready for new guests who will be checking in. Did you want us to make up the room now?"" Huh?? The room was made up promptly but the bed linens…"
July 2018,A relaxng girls night out,"Had night out with girl friends. So we decided to hang out in The Hari hotel bar. The drink menu is perfect, something for everyone. Service was awesome and Nabil was very accommodating. Will be back definitely!"
May 2018,Brilliant,"Stayed at the Hari numerous times. Fantastic location, exceptional service. Some rooms are a little small but very well appointed. Always an all around great experience. We dont bother with other hotel options in London anymore."
July 2018,Beautiful hotel in great location ,"Stayed here during Wimbledon finals with friends , amazing hotel with very great staff. Location is perfect for a jog in Hyde park to shopping in Sloane street. Staff were very helpful and particular thanks to the bar staff who were great fun.  Rooms and bedding are great with good quality products. Would definitely recommend. "
July 2018,Celebration for my 30th!,"My husband took me here last night as a celebratory night away for my 30th! It was amazing! Staff were all friendly and couldn’t do more for you! Room was lovely...modern, stylish and full of everything you could need! And all the little added touches (from a mobile device to make calls and roam the internet free of charge...to birthday messages and a bottle of champagne on arrival) were an added bonus! Thank you to everyone for making my birthday so special. And a thank you shout out to Danny for helping arrange it all!"
July 2018,Hari Happiness,"The Hari Hotel, located in the Belgravia section of London, is a very nice luxury hotel with all of the amenities you need to relax and be very comfortable. The rooms and bed are outstanding. You will sleep like a baby. The restaurant and gym are excellent too. The hotel staff will make you feel welcome, safe, and very comfortable. I have stayed at the Hari on three occasions and I will be back!"
June 2018,Highly recommend this hotel,"Basically ticks all the boxes-the staff were efficient and very helpful and friendly -the rooms and bathrooms were clean and the furniture in the rooms were in good condition  -I especially loved the location of the hotel, clean and quiet streets/area. Very close to the well known L’eto and walking distance to Harrods and Harvey Nichols and other designer brands along the way"
July 2018,The Hari Hotel: the best small hotel in London.,"This hotel has great rooms, excellent service and is centrally located near Hyde Park, Knightsbridge, Harrods and all public transportation. And the best.shower.ever. Their concierge staff is exceptional (Ben can do it all). You won't be disappointed."
May 2018,Good to be back,"It was great to return to the Hari, the staff were extremely welcoming and we forgot how  attentive they are. After a full day shopping .... it was great to drop into the bar for a cocktail which has such cool music... The beds are so relaxing  with white linen ready for you to fall into..   we will be back u soooooooon!  "
January 2018,"Great service, and a great hotel!","The hotel itself is amazing inside and out. When I arrived, I was offered a drink at reception. I was checked-in, then went to my room. The room didn't have a walk in shower (however was advertised) so I went and told reception, they happily moved me to another room. I would 100% stay again. At £300+ a room, it isn't cheap, but defintely worth the money. I stayted in one of the King Deluxe rooms. It's also in a great location just five minutes in a cab from Victoria and a stones throw from the Kings Road in Chelsea."
May 2018,Extremely polite staff,"I was there a few days ago and found he staff very polite, compared to other places I have been. Atmosphere is nice and cozy. There is nice restaurant and food is tasty. Prices are pretty normal for that location and level of experience.  From my room there was a view to London Eye and the Shard, also there was a small cozy balcony, where you could go out and take a look at the city."
April 2018,Wonderful Stay!,"We were in London for my husband's 35th birthday, and headed to a Manchester United  game. The Hari was the perfect hotel for a relaxing vacation. As soon as we arrived we were warmly greeted and upgraded to a King Suite room overlooking the park. The room was bright and modern and even had a sitting nook! The hotel itself is very trendy and has a great bar upstairs with fantastic cocktails.All of the staff went out of their way to make us feel special and welcome. They even left us a bottle of champagne and wine on separate nights to celebrate the occasion.   I have been to London several time but never stayed in the area where the Hari is located, and i fell in love with London all over again. The area is similar to the upper east side in NYC; lovely townhomes, cozy cafes,…"
April 2018,"Lovely hotel, amazing staff","This hotel is amazing. Myself and my husband enjoyed our stay here. Unfortunately, I was very sick with a stomach bug so I didn’t get to enjoy the hotel as much as I would’ve liked, thankfully our room was really nice and cozy. My husband enjoyed the drinks and found the service at the bar great. There was also a large variety of books and magazines in the lobby to read.  Mostly good but there was a few negatives. I found the bed was a bit too hard. I love firm mattresses, but this was extremely firm. I found it very busy and noisy during certain periods of the day in our room because there was a lot of staff going in and out of the room next to ours which I found very odd. The terrace area was beautiful but people were smoking cigars out there and it was quite overwhelming.…"
April 2018,Amazing hotel !,Great hotel fantastic location and very friendly staff looking forward to my next stay ! Great views from the rooms excellent room service and a good Concierge team who are very professional would highly recommend. Adam.
April 2018,Superb location and sterling staff,We stayed at The Hari hotel in Belgravia last week. We cannot fault it. The staff were amazing and the bed was one of the comfiest we've ever had the pleasure of sleeping in.  They have a fantastic breakfast in the hotel restaurant and the bar isnt too shabby either. If you're looking for an 'all round' great place to stay in central london - look no further.
April 2018,Lovely experience ,"Well well, I finally found an amazing place in London. Absolutely lovely experience and lovely staff. I had the gnocchi with zucca, taleggio and speck. A lovely signature tiramisù and an amazing cocktail. The staff, Anna, Dario and Zi, looked after me very well. I highly recommend the place if you are looking for properly Italian food and amazing cocktails. Definitely I will come back to try the other dishes from the menu."
May 2018,I decided to come back..,".. and was not disappointed.  First time i visited the hotel I had booked a King Suite which i found a bit dark.. so this time as I was travelling with a friend I booked a Twin Premium room. Excellent room with a lovely view.. and not dark at all.  The service from the door man, to the consignee.. is out standing. You really feel welcome.  The tiny outdoor terrace is quite nice.  The rooms are not big but they really work great.  You have all you need. Great amenities. Clean rooms! Nice mini bar.. you can hardly ask for more.  We did not try the breakfast nor the restaurant.  Will I come back.. yes.. already booked for next week ;o)"
April 2018,Perfect ,"I don’t often write reviews but when I do I go big! What a great stay! I would recommend to anyone. It’s a great location, close to good shops, cafes, and tourist sites.  The staff were amazing and catered to all our needs precisely and with a smile. We have a newborn and they were fantastic at helping us settle in.  They allowed us a early and late checkout, gave great recommendations on dining and  were always willing to help.  This place is highly recommendable. We are staying here again two weeks. Well played “ The Hari” well played! "
May 2018,Vacation,"This is a wonderful, quiet hotel in Belgravia. The very personalized service enhances the stay and visit. The rooms are small but good storage and a very comfort bed. Spotless. Would recommend for couples"
May 2018,"Location; good, service; good, quality; good.","When booking, I wanted to find a place which was new to me so thanks TripAdvisor! I had brought 2 extra guests with me so instead of getting 2 rooms I opted for the king suite because it had a king bed and a separate room with a pullout. I was somewhat underwhelmed when I entered the room because the “lounge” seemed a little basic but actually it was high quality. The king bed was delightful but the a/c in the room seemed to be hit or miss and didn’t quite get the room as cold as I typically like. Having the window open on the second floor was quite loud so it was a catch 22; loud and cold or warmer and quiet. All the furnishings in the room were of high quality and the community areas were very well appointed with books everywhere! The bar was lovely with a great option of…"
May 2018,tp,Amazing hotel and location. rooms are nice and very well serviced. the staff is great and very helpful. the food and breakfast are very good and so is the whole ambiance of the hotel! strongly recommend it!
May 2018,Perfect Boutique hotel in Belgravia,On arrival we were greeted with lovely doormen who took our car keys. Our check in very smooth and friendly. Our suite was fabulous with a lovely big double shower and bath. Lots of light .....our first visit and it won’t be our last! 
May 2018,OK...,Nice enough place. Not cheap. Used to be the Sheraton at one point. Had a facelift. All a bit meh.. location is not bad though it is v quiet if you seek action. High end residentially neighbourhood. Room was small and boxy.. NY style.. modern design and furnishings. Nice enough. Staff were friendly and pleasant. Just a bit like a high end Sheraton with a new coat of paint.. which it kind of is... 
April 2018,Best Hotel in London,"Have been staying at the Hari for years and it never fails to excell. Just stayed there for a week and it was like home away from home. We were remembered by staff from the moment we arrived and made to feel more than welcome. Our favorite room was waiting for us and we settled right in. Benjamin, the concierge, worked his magic and got us tickets to a brand new, sold out show and, over all, it could not have been better.   The Hari is the only place we stay while in London. Truly 5 star."
April 2018,"Amazing Hotel, Service and Location","The hotel is fantastic with a great vibe.  I was there for a business trip and received an upgrade to Junior suite with a wonderful view . The room is excellent and the staff just awesome. Someone is always there to not just greet you but have a non intrusive, nice short conversations, with you while you wait for a cab, walking to your room etc.  The front office teams and the boys at the front are amazing.  Location is perfect - walking distance to major shopping and good restaurants  My stay there was nothing short of exceptional in every way !"
May 2018,Modern boutique hotel,"We were welcomed for our anniversary with a bottle of champagne and 2 bottle of wine and chocolate mousse. This is definitely one the best option in Chelsea/kensington/belgravia. Modern decor, clean rooms, professional staff and great location make this hotel very unique in London.    It's a little bit pricey but it's worth it!"
May 2018,40th Birthday celebrations,Have to say what an amazing hotel. Ideal location in central London. The rooms are well appointed with great lighting. Service is very attentive yet subtle. Food was delicious with a great selection of cocktails and drinks. Loved the special extra touches for my birthday. Overall fantastic experience in a boutique London hotel. Highly recommend to anyone.
May 2018,Perfect weekend break,"This is a lovely hotel in a very nice location. All of the staff we came across were excellent, they were welcoming and they were always very courteous, pleased to help in any way they could. A credit to the hotel. We had a nice (quiet) ‘superior king’ room on the 9th floor, all the facilities you needed were there in the room. It was a decent size, with a good ensuite bathroom (with the most gorgeous Italian tiles!) Only had breakfast at the hotel once but there were lots of lovely fresh options, so would recommend to eat there. Definitely would make a return visit and would recommend to anyone thinking of traveling to London."
May 2018,"Stay here, you won’t regret it!!","Amazing trip, amazing place and amazing location. Couldn’t recommend it more!!  Thank you to the entire staff and the kindness you provided and service you gave.  You couldn’t ask for a better place to enjoy joke trip business or pleasure! "
May 2018,Excellent +++ stay,"I was visiting London with my 18 yo son to watch Hamilton musical.  We loved the location, very quiet Belgravia neighborhood (few (less than 10) minutes walk from the tube and buses).  The hotel is located in a quiet street overlooking a green small square.  The room we had was on the 7th floor overlooking the square, spacious and clean with very good rain shower and comfortable bed. Also a great sofa in kind of a closed small balcony! There were few small personal gestures that made our stay very warm and friendly.  Upon the arrival we got a welcome letter with few cookies and kind of London paint from sugar powder and when we returned to the room after watching Hamilton we found kind of a miniature of the theatre made from chocolate.  Each evening we got some sweets near our…"
May 2018,Recommend!,"We had a great experience staying at the Hari! The entire staff was super friendly and helpful. The bartenders, Michael, Victor and Eduardo, were excellent and gave great recommendations! The restaurant accommodated several special requests. Will return!"
April 2018,Too highly priced for such an average place!..,"This hotel is in Knightsbridge (or near it?) located on a very quiet square with nothing to do around it.  It claims to be 5 star (for whatever reason it was given the 5 stars difficult to tell??), but it is hardly a 4 star... (we have done 5 star and 4 star London hotels many more times before, so we know quite well what the standards are like).  The rooms are incredibly small and badly kept (except the bathrooms which were not too bad).  Walls are paper thin. You can hear everything that goes on in the narrow corridor. The elevator is tiny.  We did not try the breakfast?.. But we did try the Bar twice: it is full of 15 year old boys eating burgers and drinking coca cola until midnight.  No atmosphere at all... Overall there are much better options around the corner on Sloane…"
May 2018,Excellent smaller but vrry personal hotel,"Always a pleasure to stay at The Hari. Great location, walking distance to Kings Road/ Sloane Square and Knightsbridge shopping. For a boutique style hotel it offers all the necessary amenities including very efficient concierge, restaurant,gym etc with incredibly friendly and helpful staff. Rooms very comfortable and spotlessly clean. Well done to the hotel team. Look forward to my return."
May 2018,The best London hotel i've stayed in!,"Our stay was perfect from beginning to end, the staff went above and beyond to make our stay amazing. Michael is definetly the star of the hotel, the friendliest happiest person you will meet! Will not be our last visit!"
May 2018,Classy hotel with excellent service,"This was my first stay at the Hari and I was not disappointed.  I was warmly greeted upon my arrival by the fellows at the front door (sorry didn’t get their names) and then by Sabrine at the front desk.  My room on the seventh floor overlooked a small park across the street and was very comfortable with all the amenities you could want.  Upon my departure, the car for the airport was very prompt and waiting for us. All in all, a very enjoyable stay and will plan to return on my next visit to London."
May 2018, Cleanliness in Rooms Poor,Overall the staff is polite and courteous however the cleanliness in the room needs improvement. There is a lot of dust accumulation on the bed side tables and furniture even after cleaning. The hotel is small but an efficient hotel with all modern amenities.  It is centrally located and coincerge and the doormen are more than willingy to help the guests .
April 2018,A haven in London,"This was my second stay at the Hari and it was even better than my first visit. The hotel greeted me warmly, upgraded my room and made sure I had everything I needed (dinner reservations etc) to make my stay relaxing and enjoyable."
May 2018,Last Stop,"A great hotel , in a great location, with welcoming and attentive staff. I stay at this hotel regularly and they are on the ball with everything you need. It is a hotel for everyone, business and vacation."
April 2018,A true sample of excellent hospitality,"Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the staff , they were very helpful and friendly with great hospitality,The room was clean and comfy. Good location; very close to everything.Overall experience was awesome ,We will definitely choose this hotel when we return to London."
April 2018,Excellent Staff and Service,"I’ve stayed at this property 7-8 times and always a lovely experience.  The staff are very pleasant and helpful and the location is excellent if you like to be close to the parks.  The room is plenty spacious for a solo traveler.  It isn’t always easy traveling alone, but the staff make it easy to forget."
April 2018,Weekend treat,Wow!! We stayed here for a 40th birthday treat for my husband and cannot fault it in any way. The staff are very attentive to needs and definitely go that extra mile to make your stay exemplary. The hotel itself has a good location and is very clean with its boutique setting. I highly recommend a stay here and will definitely be going back soon! 
April 2018,Outstanding boutique hotel.,My sisters and I were meeting my son for a couple of days in London. The suite was lovely.   The hotel services were great.  The people were terrific and very helpful in making recommendations and reservations.    just a terrific stay.  
April 2018,Wonderful oasis in a crazy city.,Great hotel in a very quiet section in the middle of London.  Very cool decor and well laid out room.  Big bathroom was very relaxing.  Pull out couch worked great for our daughter.  Downside is Underground is not close by.  Would certainly stay here again.
March 2018,Something a little different,I did ALOT of research for our London hotel and was pleased with our stay.  Ill start with the good. The hotel was modern and stylish and had a cute cafe downstairs. It was in a good location and was around a 7 minute walk to the tube. Our room looked over the garden across the road and there was a lovely window seat to relax in. The staff were friendly. We tried to have a drink in the bar a couple of times but you could never get a seat.   The not so good. The walls are paper thin!! We had a couple staying next door to us who were having screaming matches from 11pm - 4am. We called reception at 1am and they said they would send someone up but they instead rang (we could hear it through the walls) they quietened for a short time before the screaming started again. We again…
February 2018,Visit,"An amazing hotel, i cant wait to return. Comfortable surrondings, reccomend this place highly. 5 star from me. Easy to get to. Customer service to a high standard warm and friendly welcome every time we came in and out. "
April 2018,Wonderful gem of a hotel,Personal and stylish hotel with great service and fantastic location. Last time we were there we had only one complaint and that was on the breakfast. This time we were very pleased with the breakfast as well so everything was perfect.
March 2018,Old fashioned comfort in a modern setting!,"We had the pleasure of experiencing this fabulous hotel just for one night but we will be back very soon.  The interiors are breathtaking matched by the warmth and quality of service and the attention to every detail.  The owners have sought to create a hotel that functions exceptionally well whilst also providing a homely experience.  All of this in a truly superb location and, to tip it off, our dog was made to feel very welcome.  We cannot wait to return.  Jason & Soraya Parker"
April 2018,Worth every penny,"The Hari has now become my favorite hotel in London.  It's located in a lovely neighborhood, and a short walk to shopping, restaurants and a quick cab ride to the sights of London.  The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable with a lot of attention to detail.  The staff go out of their way to make you feel welcomed and are very attentive.  When I mentioned my God daughter would be visiting and I was in town for her birthday, they surprised us both with multicolored lights, a balloon filled ceiling and a special chocolate cake.  The balloon streamers had happy birthday wishes in different languages from different staff members.  They certainly knew how to make a 14 year old feel special!  Oh - and their breakfast choices are delicious as is their coffee."
April 2018,Mrs,"Stay at the hotel regularly it is good value for money, clean and staff are very nice and the food is great also the location for me is fantastic The only downside to the hotel is that all the black cab drivers on the rank outside constantly using hotel toilet in the reception"
April 2018,Best staff and hotel,"Amazing hotel. Excellent service, beautiful room and lobby. Great location. Very comfortable bed, sheets, pillows and towels all excellent.  I would say that the only downside was the size of the room, a little too small"
April 2018,Amazing place,I celebrated my 24th birthday in The Hari  Hotel in the bar and the staff was really kind and friendly they even decorate the place for me.Vittorio was taking care of me and my guests without making us missing anything. Michael at the bar was really friendly and polite and Vanessa and Eleonora they were amazing. The atmosphere was really good for celebrating my  birthday definitely I will come back.
April 2018,Awesome hotel,"The hari is the best hotel in London!  A magic place, a magical place to relax and spend a quiet evening! wonderful staff. a special thanks goes to Vittorio Boano who made my magic evening. Funny, sweety and lovely. Xoxo"
April 2018,The best staff and best location ,"Excellent hotel in a top notch location in the West End of London, walking distance from Harrods, Buckingham Palace, London Tower and the Churchill War Rooms. The rooms are beautifully decorated, and very clean and the staff were so accommodating and helpful. "
April 2018,London family trip in March,"The staff is excellent they always smiled and try to help, the location is one of most good location on London, the most helpful reception staff in London, and there restaurant have the best donuts in city "
March 2018,The Best Hotel in London,"The service at The Hari is unparalleled. As an avid traveler, I have stayed in some amazing hotels, but none lived up to this one. Before I even checked in, the concierge helped immensely with planning my trip. He was also able to procure tickets to sold-out shows and museum exhibits. The room was small, yet cozy, and every time I returned from my day, there was always some sort of treat waiting (my favorite being a miniature chocolate diorama of the theater that was showing the play I was to see that night. All of the seats were made of mini chocolates, and my seats were made of white chocolate.) The attention to detail and ability to meet any needs and wants of the customer greatly impressed me. When I return to London, there is no doubt in my mind I will return to The Hari.…"
February 2018,Enjoying London,"Great Hotel and super professional team, Hari is well located and their personel will do the job to make sure guests have the best experience ever  while staying with them in London. I strongly recommend."
March 2018,Fantastic hotel,"What an amazing hotel, from the welcome to the decor to the food the whole experience is one of the best in London. Alex was so welcoming and a special surprise of an Easter Egg with compliments of the chef was an unexpected and wonderful surprise. Living in London I have stayed at many hotels but The Hari truly did blow me away. I cannot recommend it enough. "
March 2018,Perfect Birthday!,"Lovely hotel, excellent location! The service and staff are amazing. Everyone made us feel special. I went to celebrate my birthday with my boyfriend and I couldn't have chosen better. First, people at reception (Sabrine,Kris, Alex and Simona) are very friendly and professional. The concierge Diego asked straight away if we needed any suggestion about where to go or things to do around the area. The room that we have stayed was perfect! Nice view looking into the park and a huge fancy bathtub. Joanna ( the guest relations) prepared a cute surprise for us. In the evening, we had dinner at the restaurant where they ( Danielle and Gianpierro) looked after us during the whole meal. Then we have decided to have a couple of drinks at the bar, where Eduardo knows perfectly which…"
February 2018,Boutique hotel with excellent service at all levels.,Well positioned hotel for Knightsbridge shopping and restaurants. Modern rooms with high spec fixtures. Electric Blackout blinds and comfortable beds leave you feeling fully rested. Breakfast in Il Pampero restaurant is varied and of extremely high quality - cooked and continental. DefInitely recommended.
February 2018,the disadvantage,"i am staying at the hari and overall i really liked the place it is comfortable. and actually what i liked more is the staff of the bar and specifically the manager “andreu” he is the best to deal with. the thing is i was shocked about the overpriced pastas that you have, i never did eat a pasta with this price and the problem is that the pasta is very normal nothings deserved the price that was nothing special with it. i thought if i am staying they will take care of me with the prices."
February 2018,Exceptional!,"Service, and exceptional service at that costs nothing. The Hari have it spot on! From the moment we stepped into the hotel nothing was too much trouble. Every person we came into contact with could not have been more helpful. The handwritten note and homemade biscuits in our room was a thoughtful touch, and we will return.  Authentic and memorable? Absolutely!"
November 2017,Classic hotel,I like It's look like combination classic and modern Hotel because sofa all of hotel like combination Classic and Modern But Classic so so Many but Modern Not many like small yups i like it Combination so Great
February 2018,Perfect hotel,"Small luxurious hotel. The location is Very good. The staff is extremely nice. The rooms are modern, Very clean and cosy. With evrything you will ever need in them. Breakfast is very good.  Would certainly come back to this hotel.   "
February 2018,Overnight stay .,This was the third time we have stayed at the Hari Hotel.Staff are always pleasant and very friendly. Very comfortable and relaxing place to stay. Overnight stay to meet family who was staying as always at the Hari Hotel on business from Australia.
January 2018,Great Hotel and Staffs,We stayed around 1 week in January and we really enjoyed. The hotel is in a prime location. Walking distance to Harrods.  All staffs were extremely friendly and helpful.  The hotel interior was very nice. The room was comfortable. And we really liked our stay in this hotel. 
January 2018,Another great night,"My favourite hotel, friendly and so comfortable, stay here every time.  Had room service for a very early breakfast, bang on time, really good breakfast.  Reception always charming and welcoming.  Beds wonderful."
January 2018,Top notch and far superior to many 5* hotels in London,"My company travel policy recently changed from 5* to 4* hotels in London and I chose The Hari based on the reviews and score on TripAdvisor. Both the reviews and scores were spot on and well deserved.  The hotel is brilliantly located with Victoria, Sloane Square and Knightsbridge tube stations all an easy walk away. There are also some useful bus routes if like me you don't always want to take the tube. Good choice of restaurants and excellent shopping in the local neighbourhood too.  The rooms are compact but so well thought out and even though I stayed 7 nights with a lot of luggage, there was plenty of space to move around. Great shower and bathroom set up. Loved the wooden floor too.  Did not eat in the restaurant for dinner but the continental breakfast is plentiful and…"
February 2018,Incredible hotel throughout ,"Booked a 4 night stay. Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by the staff and were checked in an upgraded room. Larger than usual rooms (in London standards), very clean and tastefully designed. Shower/bath excellent. Hotel lobby, facilities and restaurant were spick and span.  Service was truly exceptional, attentive, fast and kind. Nothing about the staff felt fake or forced and they gave the kind of service which felt honest and made us feel at home. The neighborhood is just perfect. Quiet and calm but close enough to stroll around or, alternatively, comfortably commute via public transport around town. Great value for money. Highly recommended"
March 2018,Perfect for shopping in Knightsbridge,"This is my second stay at the hotel. The first time the staff were friendly. I did comment that the room is a bit dark. They offered me a lamp but I declined. On my second trip, I was surprised they remembered my comment and they had already put in an extra lamp in my room. I felt very welcomed in the hotel. Special thanks to Sabrina and the other lady front desk staff who checked me in on 22/3 night time (to be exact it was 1am on 23/3), they were very helpful, efficient and friendly."
March 2018,Sneaky Get Away,"Even though we live in London we still like having the odd night away in town. The Hari was a great for us, a lovely boutique hotel in a superb location.The staff were all particularly friendly and professional which is often the most important part of a stay away. Our room had everything you would need and a great window seat looking over a small park. The Hotel Bar was excellent with very good cocktails and great service. We had the continental breakfast which was very good. We would be very happy to stay here again."
March 2018,First Class,"I visited The Hari last weekend.  I could not fault anything.  The service, breakfast, dinner, room and bar were all amazing.  Nothing was too much trouble for the very smartly dressed staff.  I will definitely be returning very soon."
March 2018,My night at The Hari,"The Hari is a hidden treasure in Belgravia. Once inside the discreet entrance it is stylish yet very comfortable with a welcoming bar and attentive staff. The restaurant il Pampero is like a little piece of Italy in the heart of London. All the staff are Italian and take pride in the food and the service. I had sea bass baked in salt, which was exquisite, with asparagus. The fresh pasta with squid ink was also delicious.  My room was stylish and luxurious. I chose to have room service for breakfast. When the tray came it could have fed a family! Fresh fruit, pastries, cheese - all beautifully presented. It was my first stay at The Hari but I would definitely recommend it. The staff were welcoming and genuinely made me feel at home."
March 2018,5 Star All The Way......,"What an amazing place! Every single member of staff makes you feel special as soon as you walk through the door. The customer service is impeccable, in fact the best I have ever come across in my travels. The hotel itself has a relaxed  cool vibe & is situated in a lovely area of London. I really can't wait for an excuse to head to London so we can stay here again! Thanks guys for looking after us so well. "
March 2018,AMAZING! Can't wait to go back,A truly 5* experience from start to finish. The hotel is filled with excellent staff who are happy to help at all times. We ate in the restaurant for dinner and would highly recommend. Throughout our stay we were made to feel like royalty. 100% will be staying again and would recommend to anyone. A piece of paradise in one of Londons nicest areas. 
February 2018,A fabulous new hotel in central London!  Hip hip 'Hari',"Oooh, what a find!  The Hari is discretely tucked away in Knightsbridge/Belgravia, yet walking distance (or a 5-minute taxi ride) to Sloane Square and Kings Road and Mayfair.  It is perfect for those wanting to easily visit and explore central London whilst having the luxury of distancing one's self from the hustle and bustle when the mood or occasion calls for it.  The Hari feels like your own private, fancy London pad, but as a hotel.  The furnishings and decorations feel luxurious, modern and cosy all at the same time.  Great bedrooms and spacious and well lit bathrooms.  The Italian restaurant is gorgeous too, serving up delicious foods and a great breakfast.  And if all of that doesn't yet convince you to stay at The Hari, the service will seal tje deal.  The chaps on the…"
March 2018,Amazing 2 day stay,"I don’t think I have ever stayed in a hotel as good as this. The location, facilities, rooms and overall accommodation are first class as you would expect from a hotel of this quality in Belgravia. I had a wonderful 2 nights of blissful sleep.  What really sets this place apart from the competition though is the staff and general level of service. Everyone is friendly and accommodating, and nothing is too much trouble.  Well done to this hotel you have managed to produce something special. I will be back in the near future, hopefully for pleasure and not Business next time!   "
February 2018,Amazing hotel and lovely staff,"We had a fabulous stay at The Hari hotel for my wife’s birthday weekend. I had notified the hotel earlier that is was her birthday and so on arrival to our room we were treated to lovely desserts and a sweet note from the front office manager. Their attention to detail is impeccable and we felt so very welcome throughout our stay. We dined at the hotel Italian restaurant Il Pampero, with us coming from the Mediterranean ourselves, we thought the food was lovely and exactly what we wanted after a long day traveling and sightseeing. All in all, great stay, perfect location and we can’t wait to be back."
March 2018,First Class in Belgravia!,"I travel extensively for work and look for hotels that not only offer me safe haven from the hustle and bustle but envelope me in an experience that has me wanting more. The Hari is one of the few hotels I’ve been where upon my arrival I felt both welcomed and delightfully overwhelmed by the hotel’s exquisite design, an extraordinary staff and all-encompassing sensory atmosphere of refinement and sophistication. Needless to say, it only got better when I entered my room with it’s stunning views of downtown London, impeccable decor and a bed to die-for. And lastly, The Hari’s restaurant (Il Pomero), lounge and gym were quite simply note-perfect! Thank you for a wonderful stay in London!"
September 2017,"Beautiful hotel, first rate service","We stayed at the Hari for our first visit to London with our daughter and son-in-law.  All four of us agreed that the hotel was beautiful and the service was impeccable.  The front desk staff lept immediately into helping us solve a problem unrelated to them and the concierge service was exceptional, helping us make arrangements around town and even scoring a reservation for us at a one of the hottest 'full' restaurants on London.  We ate at the Hari's own restaurant 3 times for breakfast and twice for dinner.  Excellent! Can't say enough good things about the Hari.  A minor draw back is that the guest rooms are somewhat dimly lit but when we return to London, this is where we will stay."
September 2017,Another fabulous weekend break at The Hari,"We have previously had a fantastic stay at The Hari so decided it would be a good choice for our recent weekender and what a good choice it was. From the time we arrived we were made to feel special and we couldn't find fault with any member of staff we met. Everyone was cheerful, relaxed and friendly and anticipated our needs. Many hotels of this calibre can be aloof...not at the Hari, London. Our room was fantastic with a wonderful window seat overlooking the tree lined street. It was immaculate, very comfortable and quiet. The turn down service provided lovely sweet treats...top marks to housekeeping :) We had dinner in the hotel's Italian restaurant and again we had a great evening with good food, wine and service. Hopefully, we will soon return to the Hari for another…"
September 2017,Best stay in London,"A great hotel, in an unbeatable location, topped with lovely warm hospitality from our hosts. We were spoilt by the team's generosity - checking in at 8am straight off a flight we were taken straight to our room. And the service stayed that way through our stay. The hotel really indulged my 9 year old son, so his expectations are now sky high! A luxurious and cool hotel - in a contemporary and unshowy way. Really world class. "
May 2017,Beautiful hotel with an awesome service,"We got to the hotel by coincide as we had to look for a place to stay overnight due to the big incident with British airways.  The hotel interior is very nice and impressive. When we arrived at the hotel, totally exhausted and frustrated, the concierge was very caring and offered us a glass of champagne immediately and made us feel comfortable and forget the stress about the incident with ease and gave us extra an exclusive room. He personally guided us to the room and showed us the accommodations. Even later at night when we've had some trouble with the phone, he came to our room within some minutes to help us out. Overall a great experience."
September 2017,Fine Stay,"The deluxe room we were booked in was very small for 2 people. The quality of room and the staff were wonderful. However, the upstairs bar and lounge were virtually inaccessible to guests later in the evening and you had to book a table in advance - that was a turn off especially if you wanted an after dinner drink. It has location going for it but we would elect to stay at another hotel next time."
August 2017,"Lovely hotel, fantastic staff","We have stayed at The Hari twice now, and both times we couldn't fault it. From the amazing welcome at reception, to the comfortable rooms and the lovely breakfast.  The is a really popular bar on the first floor and great restaurant on the ground floor  Brilliant location. Great Staff"
September 2017,The Hari,"for me, the location is ideal: in belgravia near sloane square and knightsbridge. The only issue I have with this hotel is that it can be a VERY popular hangout for locals in the evenings-and has the same atmosphere as a nightclub; which can be annoying if your wanting a quiet bite or drink after being out all day-too risky to use as a meeting point for a drink as you will most-likely be turned away."
September 2017,Felt like home!,"We had the best experience at The Hari. The rooms are not big, but are very comfortable and quiet, with great firm mattresses and amazing linen. But the very best is the staff. They truly care about the guests and do everything to make our stay more pleasurable. One morning I praised the staff about the delicious pastries served every night. Guess what they surprised me with? A box of pastries to take home with me. We loved The Hari."
September 2017,Perfect place,Really nice hotel in the heart of Belgravia. Lot of amenities including a mobile phone to be used during your stay. You can borrow a bike here. This turned my day in a perfect evening biking in Hyde park and reaching the restaurant by bike. Everybody has been lovely in the hotel. Definitely a place to be.
September 2017,Very nice experience,"The Hotel is very nice, the staff is professional, and they made me feel as a I was home. Very nice experience, very convenient location and warmly greeted. I will reccommend this Hotel and I will use also for my private trip"
December 2017,Perfect boutique hotel in the heart of London,"Whether for business or pleasure The Hari is my number 1 choice of Hotel in London.  Service is excellent, the concierge will get you into the best restaurant of the area, the bar of the Hari is the hot spot of Belgravia. "
December 2017,"Very helpful & friendly staff, great location - will be back next year!",The Hari is a lovely quiet hotel in a perfect location. Room was a little dark and the lights were difficult to coordinate (I wasn't able to put just one lamp on!)  I had trouble connecting to the wifi and the staff were very helpful in helping me to fix it. Loved the little extra touches like giving us water before we left and the cakes at reception. The bed was a little on the firm side but everything was clean and lovely and very warm! Very happy with our stay and will return next time we're in London.
December 2017,Great London location - dark room,"I visited the hotel for a long Christmas weekend with my 10 year old child.  We arrived at 15 o'clock to the hotel. and the room was ready at 15:30 so we waited in the lobby.  The staff was very friendly when we arrived and check in went well. I got a room at the 5th floor.   The room had a very small living room, a bedroom and a even small bathroom. The room in general is very nice and function ok. but it was small very small! We had a issue with one of the windows that could not close completely. which meant that the room was very cold. we reported it but it was not fixed during our stay nor did we receive any proposal from management to change room. not really nice when you have 3 days in the same room with a very cold 10 year kid. The room is very dark. that is ok if you…"
December 2017,Warm stay in the winter,This is the second time I’ve stayed in this hotel which I consider my home in London. The rooms are spacious and wooden floored which is the right thing to avoid allergies. The team is very warm always ready to fulfill all guests requests. I suggest this hotel to everyone who wants to be taken care and pampered.
October 2017,Welcoming stay - will return!,"It's not often that I stay at a hotel that exceeds my expectations, but The Hari definitely did. What I loved the most about this place were the members of staff - it's a cliche when people say ""they really couldn't do enough for me"" but in this case it totally applies. For example, when I needed a steam service rather than a press service for the delicate gowns that I had with me, they let me use the hotel's steamer (as the dry cleaner they use doesn't offer a steam service). The staff are extremely friendly and will do their best to help with any request, which is what you need when you're away from home.   The room was a tad small, but lovely (and typical size for London, really) - comfortable bed and a beautiful view over London from a little balcony. If I were to be picky…"
December 2017,Remarkable guest service,We arrived late night and were very disappointed with the room we booked..it is called kings suit however it was ridiculously small.. We hated the hotel and we seriously wer thinking of changing to a different hotel the next day. when we complained they promised to upgrade us the following morning. The next day we came back to the hotel to fund that all our stuff moved to a beautiful spacious room with amazing views. Throughout our stay the staff proved to be highly professional in addition to being super nice and sweet..starting with the doorman..reception..concierge..room service..etc.  Breakfast at the restaurant is excellent..especially the eggs Benedict and the pancakes. The beds are super comfy with high quality bedding. The bathroom was beautiful..it has a Jacuzzi with a…
December 2017,First class!,"We were given a warm welcome by the doorman and our check was very efficient but friendly. Our room was very cosy and was well equipped with everything needed for a relaxing stay. Bathrobes and slippers are also provided and some decent toiletries in the bathroom. We did try the bar which was great too! Friendly and knowledgeable barman who looked after us well.  Location is good too, for shopping and some good places to eat."
November 2017,Outstanding,"Thank you for a brilliant stay.  I will definitely be back.   Outstanding service, great attention to detail, delicious evening meal in the restaurant.     No request too much trouble.  A rate find.   Look forward to becoming a regular visitor "
October 2017,Stunning 5+star Boutique hotel,"Boutique hotels are all the rage. This is in a class all by itself from the moment you are greeted by Jack the door man. Our room was not yet ready since we arrived from Heathrow mid morning. Carlo on the front desk treated us to breakfast in the hotel""s restaurant bar....rich golden scrambled eggs and five star treatment by Elena. A smart phone was charged and ready to go in our room..invaluable when out in the city.  Room details perfect and sweet touch with gourmet chocolates at night. Ben the concierge handled the booking of our tours and gave invaluable advice for all our needs in London. We will definitely return!"
November 2017,Wonderful place,"We stayed at the Hari for a romantic couple and everything was so perfect, from the start with Jorge to help us with our bags under a heavy rain, everybody at the front desk was so nice and helpful and the concierge made our trip even better. I would definetly recommend The Hari to everybody who would want to have an pleasing, enjoyable moment in a wonderful place. Thanks a lot to everybody there"
October 2017,Loved it,Great Location near some great shops and restaurants just a walk away. Amazingly friendly and helpful staff who were very polite and happy at all times. Lovely clean hotel with an extremely comfy bed.
October 2017,Luxury Hotel with Superb Service.,"Myself and my sister stayed at The Hari for a girly weekend. We couldn't have hoped for a better experience in any way. It was just perfect. The Hari oozes so much style and sophistication with its quirky interior design and mood lighting. Our room had an amazing view of London so it felt rather special to enjoy a glass of champagne overlooking the autumnal sunset. The food was of fantastic quality and the dishes from the specials menu did not disappoint. However, we thought that it was the desserts in particular which were outstanding in both presentation and taste. We were superbly looked after by the staff who had the perfect balance of attentiveness and a respectful distance meaning we felt relaxed enough to enjoy our meals at our own pace. The location of the hotel was also…"
October 2017,Great service!,"I stayed a week in this great boutique hotel. It's a great hotel all around. But the service of the front desk team was superb (Thank you, Cesar!).   From check in to check out, the staff's service was above expectation — professionalism, friendliness, attention to details, knowledge about the area, great recommendations for activities etc.   The hotel is also located in a good location between Sloane Square and Hyde Park, Great places to walk or bike around."
October 2017,Excellent Hotel in every way,"We spent a long weekend in London at The Hari to celebrate my wife’s birthday.  Everything was great.  The staff is lovely and so accommodating. While I was making the reservation I ran into a snag and Nicole at the front desk called me in the states to sort it all out.  Once we got to The Hari all of the staff matched that level of helpfulness and we found a bottle of champagne chilling in our room.  We were in 904, which has a small balcony (I was able to fit a small chair on it!) and overlooks the park.  The bathroom is well outfitted with a shower/tub and a separate w/c.  The bed was wonderfully comfortable.  I do wish, as I find in many hotels, there were more drawers in which to unpack.  We got extra hangers and the problem was solved.  The hotel’s location in Belgrade’s,…"
October 2017,Lovely Boutique Hotel,"I had a wonderful 6-night stay at The Hari. They managed to meet my request for an early check in (at 9am) after a 14-hour overnight flight, which was a most lovely start to my stay. Throughout my stay, the room was kept very clean and neat, and i was most delighted with the daily packets of different types of sweets/candy/chocolates that were sent up each evening. The service is also warm and friendly, with all staff (from reception to cleaners) giving friendly greetings whenever we meet. I also loved the location, Knightsbridge, which is super convenient to get to anywhere. And being located in a rather quiet (but still conveniently located) neighbourhood, i could get quiet rest at night, without being disturbed by traffic noise or rowdy drunk people (which i've encountered…"
October 2017,"Beautiful hotel, nice staff but room disappointed","This is a beautiful hotel, with a great location, and a very friendly and helpful staff. However, my friend and I found the room a sub par experience. First of all, the lighting was way too dim. But the worst part was there was nowhere to easily dry and style our hair. I understand that you can't have an electrical outlet in the bathroom for a hair dryer. That's true most places in Europe. But most other hotels I've stayed in provide an area with a mirror and outlet where you can easily accomplish your daily routine. At Hari, we had to ask for an extension cord to plug the hair dryer in on the wall outside the bathroom so we could use the one wall mirror in the room across from the bathroom. It was very difficult to dry our hair. And I would prefer not to look at myself in a…"
October 2017,Form over Function,"I liked the overall feeling of the hotel - great design, very friendly and outgoing staff and wonderful location.  While the design was great, the function wasn't so great.  There wasn't enough space in the room for our things - I think that people who design hotel rooms should be asked to stay in them for a few nights!  I ended up using the window sill as a shelf/drawer. The bathroom also looked nice however the shower head was placed so that I couldn't stand under it without hitting the wall or the shelf with the shampoo.  And the lighting looked great but made it impossible to shave.  "
October 2017,Wonderful long weekend,"From the moment we arrived to our departure the service was second to none. Check in was seamless the room fabulous and the food exquisite. All the staff members where extremely knowledgeable,helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble for them . I celebrated my birthday that weekend, they provided a fabulous cake and the personal touches throughout the weekend where unexpected but very welcome. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and would not think twice about staying again."
October 2017,Outstanding Hotel | 6 Star Experience,"This is our second visit to this hotel, previously it was part of the Thompson Hotel Group. The Hari is an outstanding hotel located in the up-market suburb of Belgravia which is close to Knightsbridge. Our welcome back to the hotel was very impressive including a beautiful bottle of champagne. The rooms are modern, clean and well equipped. The beds are very comfortable and the turn-down service each evening was a lovely touch. All the staff made us feel very welcomed and nothing was too much trouble. If you are after a special hotel experience, you can’t look past the Hari. Thanks to the Front Desk, Conceirge, Doormen and Cleaning Staff for a another outstanding stay at this hotel. TG&DD"
September 2017,great London hotel in Belgravia,great London hotel with great staff and room. close to all shopping on Sloane st. free welcome drinks and coffee and very nice bar on the roof that you can smoke cigars which are not many in London. one of the best bedroom set up not seem in many European hotel in this level  
October 2017,So Pleased I Settled on The Hari,"It's always a bit of a shot in the dark when booking a hotel.  I changed my mind a couple of times over the months that I was planning a stay in London and I was not disappointed that I finally settled on The Hari.  The hotel is in a beautiful area of London with easy walking to shops, restaurants and tube stations.  The staff were, without exception, excellent.  It never failed to amaze (and impress) me that the Concierge, Mr. Malpass, called me by name every time I walked through the lobby even though I hadn't taken advantage of his expertise...how does he do that!?!?  I would certainly recommend The Hari and hope to be able to return."
November 2017,Great hotel in London.,"We were in London for three days and the hotel exceeded our expectations.   It has excellent design, a great restaurant and superb location.   The concierge was very helpful as the whole staff.   It is a five minute walk from Harrods."
October 2017,Nice hotel in nice area,I stayed at The Hari for one night at the end of October. The hotel was a easy walk from Knightsbridge underground. Reception staff were friendly & check in was quick. I had a drink at the bar and where as some of the clientele were obnoxious the staff were friendly & helpful.  The room itself was spacious and I loved the little window sitting area. Didn’t find the rooms that soundproof though as I could hear my neighbours speaking when they returned to their room in the early hours which was annoying but I did have ear plugs with me so these were promptly used.  
November 2017,Work Trip,Excellent experience. Staff was very welcoming and friendly. Great bar and restaurant on site and extremely luxurious room and overall vibe. Room service was also great with many options. I will definitely be back!
November 2017,Unbelievable service!,Wow wow wow Well done to staff and management on your unbelievable service! From the minute we arrived the staff could not do enough for us. You asked for something and within minutes it would arrive. When I arrived back from my run the doorman had a bottle of water waiting for me at reception! Amazing! Friendly courteous I really have never encountered this type of service. We will definitely be back!
November 2017,Ezekiel,"It’s was an excellent place, the area was just about perfect with good people. Hotel staff was very friendly, would suggest them to add more variety to the bar menu. Everything you need is at a walking distance. Would highly recommend."
January 2017,home,"the hotel staff  makes you feel like youare at home . comfortable and soo friendly . the concierge , the receptionist and there manager , the whole workers are the best all what i can say . the rooms are wide and so clean . the location is best on my opinion. plus yo can sense the special treatments when you are regular gusts as myself  "
November 2017,Our 4 Days bei The Hari,"We had an excellent stay here to visit our son in Belgravia. The hotel room was clean and quite beautiful. Especially the bathroom with a wonderful shower. The bed and pillows are excellent. The staff was very attentive and kind. Alex Cohen, Sabrina and Ricardo were always willing to help us...It shows that the hotel really does stick to very high standards and wants to make one's stay as pleasant and hassle free as possible. Drinks at the bar are a pleasure and the atmosphere is just right being not too quiet but also not too busy.  We really recommend it as a whole. "
October 2017,Nice stay in London,"We went there for 2 nights! The lobby and staff was extraordinary! Very great neighborhood, we had to walk about 10 min to the closest underground station and about 5 min for the bus station wich was alright! The room was super clean, the bed comfortable and well decorated, but it was also very small and so so so dark! I don't think i'll stay there if i come back to london, but it was a nice stay!"
October 2017,Perfect stay at The Hari! ,"I was heartbroken when my boyfriend dumped me only a few days before my trip to London, but The Hari were so welcoming even though I ended up traveling there with my mother in stead! They gave me wine and chocolate, and everyone had a smile on their faces at all times. The gym is small but has it all, the restaurant is great and the drinks are tasty. Perfect location. Will definitely be back! "
January 2018,The Greatest boutique hotels in London,Stayed with my family at The Hari for a week. The friendly and helpful team went above and beyond to make my wife’s birthday special. We travelled with our baby and for such a posh hotel they were extremely family friendly- from helping with the pushchair to recommending suitable restaurants. The hotel is ideally located and a few minutes away from most tourist sites in central London. The rooms are very comfortable and clean. Room service and front desk are responsive and attentive. Suitable for every type of Traveller. The Hari ticked all the boxes for me! 
January 2018,"Great staff, Great property, Great location",Thank you to Simona for everything. She always makes our stay unique. When we arrived she made sure we would have a list of nice bars and restaurants. Staff as a whole is very helpful. Great 5 Star hotel for people that wish to feel at home.
January 2018,Great hotel!,"The staff at The Hari Hotel were incredibly accommodating and extremely helpful.  Although the hotel was in a quiet neighborhood, it was in a central location with good access to public transportation, restaurants, shopping, and museums. "
January 2018,Great service.,"Would highly recommend the Hari. The interior is beautiful but what really makes the place special are the people working there. Friendly, sassy and professional with excellent attention to detail.  Really enjoyed my stay and look forward to returning. "
June 2017,belgravia boutique with cute furnishings and a great bar and terrace,"great location in the heart of belgravia, lovely rooms if a little small, may not suit all, great service, and super cozy and cool bar area with a cigar terrace to spend sunday afternoons - penthouse suite can be great fun"
January 2018,perfect location,"staying at the Hari was part of my 80th birthday celebrations, perfectly placed for our evening entertainment at the Royal Albert Hotel, and on the following day a visit to the V & A museum, The Queens Gallery etc. I have awarded this hotel and its staff a 100% rating for their facilities, welcome and hospitality, they were truly wonderful to myself and my wife and we cant thank them enough. Do we recommend them ? yes of course, and will we return, we certainly hope so, they will be the first we contact on our next trip to london, hopefully later this year. Thank you Hari we are still talking about you to our family and friends."
January 2018,They have the best bar assistant manager(Andrea),"I visit this place quite frequently, one of my favorite spots in london! Their lounge atomsphere is very chill and laid back. And their service is great, the reason i always visit back their place is their assistant bar manager andrea. He is very helpful and welcoming he always looks out for the customers and makes sure they are satified with everything and enjoying their time. I really like and recommend this place thanks to Andrea, and for whoever who goes there ask for him!"
October 2017,Affordable Luxury with Great Location,I was excited to go back to the Hari Hotel - even though its name changed from my stay a few years ago the Hotel and staff are as amazing as ever. You really cannot get a better hotel for this rate - from the moment you walk in to the hotel there is someone there to greet you and make sure you have everything for your stay. Little things like sending tea to my room upon check-in really make an impression in feeing like this is a home away from home. The street view from the room is gorgeous and the bathroom is very luxurious with some of the fluffiest towels I have had the pleasure to use. Although we were only there for a one night business trip I look forward to returning soon with my family for pleasure!
January 2018,NFL Games,"The Hari was amazing! The hotel was very modern and up to date! I enjoyed the mobile phone that was available for us to use throughout the city. Bikes were even available if we wanted to use them to get around the city! The rooms were a nice size, obviously smaller than US rooms but perfect and quaint. I definitely enjoyed my stay! "
October 2017,Excellent location,Stayed here for 2 nights on a businuss trip. Location near our office. Excellent service. Rooms to the street can be noisy. What they must improve is their coffee. Nice interior design. Friendly and attentive doormen.
February 2018,"Great hotel, Bad Managment","First of all, I have to say the staff was very friendly and they gave me a warm welcome and I really enjoyed my stay overall. My room was very clean and even though it didn't have a view it had a unique style which is the first time I've ever seen in a London hotel.  I tried the Italian restaurant which I have to say was excellent and very delicious but I realized that there was a huge price gap between the bar and the restaurant. The most expensive pasta in the restaurant is £25 while a normal white pasta in the bar is £35. It's unbelievable that the hotel management could change the price of any food in the bar to their liking. There weren't lots of selections of food to try in the bar. While I was waiting for my food to arrive at the bar and I noticed a rat coming out of the…"
March 2018,Perfect stay,"Beautiful room, lovely stay, everyone was very accommodating. Loved the fresh new design of the place and the location is superb, you don’t hear any traffic from your room. First time staying but for sure will return, great value "
March 2018,Birthday weekend getaway,"My partner & I recently stayed at the Hari for a weekend getaway for my birthday and I shall say straight away, that this hotel is of extremely high-quality. The Suite We stayed in the Studio King Suite on the 6th floor of the hotel which was suburb on every level. To start, it is worth mentioning the generous space of the room itself which was a very nice surprise (especially for a London Hotel) this factor really did make us both feel more comfortable and added to the sense of prestige. Everything in the room is incredibly well finished from the furnishings to the art, styling and décor; it effortlessly oozes class and luxury. I was amazed by the overall quality and feel of the room. The bed was very comfortable which enabled an excellent night’s sleep and added this, top of…"
January 2018,"Lovely Hotel, Brillant staff","We recently stayed at the Hari on a visit to London, On arrival we were greeted by extremely friendly and helpful staff.  The hotel is a boutique style and different to many London Hotels with a style all of it's own. The room was beautiful with a serene ambience and the bed was very comfortable, We had a complimentary bottle of bubbles in the room as well. A fabulous stay, highly recommended"
March 2018,Have a drink,"Amazing team, we had nice night with my friend over there. Professional and warm thank you to Vittorio and Michael.  And special big up for Edoardo cause his creations was amazing! Really talented !  Thanks to Juan to recommande us this place :)"
February 2018,"The Hari,best hotel in London!","Already at arrival the friendly staff welcomed us and proposed us a drink. The room was beautiful, contemporary decorated and very practical. The  location is great! The breakfast buffet was delicious and everything we ordered à la carte too! I highly recommend this hotel! "
February 2018,Fantastic hotel!,"I booked here on a recommendation and it did not disappoint! Upon arrival the staff were very welcoming and attentive. Our room had a fantastic view of the city (i would recommend asking for a top floor room) and it had all of the amenities you would expect for the price with a fantastic location near to a number of Tube stations and Harrods.    Breakfast was good too with a huge range of options. Breakfast staff were very friendly and provided good suggestions.   The one strange, and slightly negative experience, we had was one staff member seemingly 'watching' us for a number of minutes while we were sitting in the casual upstairs lounge after breakfast while my partner and I discussed our plans for the day. This staff member then proceeded to come up to us and ask our room…"
January 2018,Absolutely one of my favorite hotels in any city!,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Hari on my last trip to London - at the end of January. I had heard about the hotel from trusted friends so wasnt completely surprised at what I found. I travel quite a lot so I look for certain things - a comfortable and well appointed room;  a gracious and helpful staff; a good location; a fine dining option and a good vibe. I am pleased to say that the Hari has it all. Plus it has a really great bar/lounge that makes it an excellent place for relaxing or holding impromptu meetings with colleagues. I am so pleased that the Hari will now be my  ""go to"" hotel in London... and I am looking forward to my next visit in June."
February 2018,Perfect Location Very Good Staff and Product,"I spend 4 nights at this beautiful hotel. The hotel is located within a walking distance from the main attractions and it is a very nice walk.  Arriving at the hotel reflected it is nice and elegant look, starting from the doorman welcoming me, the concierge assisting me with my luggage to the receptionist who made a fast and efficient check-in.  The room looked beautiful and elegant with the right space and fit outs with a very nice bathroom and amenities. Comfortable bed and linens with excellent TV channel collection.  The food was very good and the response of the staff was excellent.  one comment that I have is, normally every hotel has a couple of complimentary water bottles but in my room there wasn't but I was given some very nice chocolates every evening.   Overall, a…"
June 2017,Great Experience in a Good Location,"Location:  Within the very affluent area of Belgravia (10 minute walk to Harrods). Nearest tube station is Knightsbridge Station (Piccadilly line) & Victoria Station (for the Gatwick Express / Victoria line), both stations within 10-12 minute walk away.  Hotel / Service:  Service here is exceptional. Checking in was good. A glass of sparkling wine and coffee was served upon our arrival at the room. The room itself was reasonably spacious and exudes class and luxury. Bathroom was well-appointed and toiletries are good quality. Housekeeping was very good.   Overall Experience:  Great experience and stay with reasonable room rates (compared to other 5 star hotels) - highly recommended in London."
January 2018,Just simply amazing for the second time!,"I was very excited to found out that me and my partner are going back to this amazing property. As expected, it did not disappoint us. In fact, it was even better! The moment we arrived at the hotel, their bellman and the receptionist greeted us with a warm smile. A couple of minutes after, Ms. Joanna showed up and guided us enthusiastically to the suite. Yes! This time we stayed at The Hari suite! My jaw just dropped and could not stop smiling up to my ears. It was just wonderful! I could say it’s one of the best suites that I have been to. There’s a fireplace and two balconies where we took some nice shots of the view using the Instax mini that they have provided free of charge to use. We captured special memories using this incredible gadget. Moreover, we also used the mobile…"
January 2018,Wonderful stay (again)!,"The Hari is an excellent hotel, with an unbeatable location and wonderful, warm staff - these are what I come back for time and time again. Everything went smoothly, and I have to give special mention to the front desk staff who had my room ready at 7am, when I checked in very early. It was great to be able to go straight to my room after a long flight, as opposed to waiting for the usual 3pm check in. Room service was faultless, both their breakfast and all-day options are great and a good go-to for those too tired or lazy to head out (although the hotel is very near great cafes around Belgravia & Chelsea, as well as Harrods and Harvey Nichols). As always, I am looking forward to my next visit! Thank you!"
January 2018,Lucky stop off,"We were walking past and were drawn in by the intriguing decor. Although this is a hotel we only stopped in to use the bar - upstairs seemed busier with atmosphere. Cocktail menu is short and sweet but stunning, try the tea for two, gin and champagne served in teapot and tea cups (tipsy afternoon tea)"
December 2017,A hidden jewel,"When I booked the Hari hotel, I did it not for the entire period ( 14 days) I would spend in London, because it would be something new. I was so  positively surprised that I did not move from the hotel and stayed the whole period. It is somewhat difficult to pinpoint the highlights, because the hotel is perfect from A to Z, beggining with the service crew, to a room with three different views and a bed simply loved by my back because of its firm although comfortable mattress, and with the best Italian restaurant around"
December 2017,Best Hotel,One of the best hotel and friendly/helpful stuff Nice location  Very clean Quite  Close to major attractions  I really recommend people not to bother themselves finding hotels in London just book The Hari. 
May 2017,Very good!,"Very nice Hotel and very popular. Beautiful rooms, convenient and clean. Nice design. Very friendly staff and helpful ! The breakfast was good and it is to mention that they have a outstanding capuccino ! Over all a great experience and I will return. "
December 2017,Fabulous hotel!,"Lovely hotel. Charming rooms. Superb location, just a stones throw from Knightsbridge and all my favorite restaurants and shops!   Great service from check in through to check out. Definitely staying here again, this may be my new London home!    "
January 2018,Best London Boutique Hotel,"This is by far the best hotel stay I've had in London. Couldn't ask for a better location.  The hotel is beautifully decorated with attention to details.  My room was absolutely wonderful, large windows overlooking the park, spacious, with a marvelous large bathroom, a work area with a variety of outlets, coffee machine & beautifully decorated as per the rest of the hotel.   In terms of customer service/care the team at The Hari are second to none. From front desk/concierge to lounge area  Extremely helpful/kind willing to go the extra mile to ensure a pleasant stay.  The perfect London Hotel !  "
October 2017,Great hotel ,"We stayed 2 nights at this hotel and it was great!!! The location is the best, the staff very friendly and helpful and the room Was great!!!  We would stay there again with out thinking twice!!! Really recommend this cute boutique hotel!!!!"
December 2017,loveliest Holiday stay in London,"first time experience with the Hari, and indeed it was soo very good. We love the room, the neighborhood, the house restaurant was fab., teens loved the place. we'll come back! very good shopping nearby!"
November 2017,Terrific London hotel,"Stayed at the Hari for the first time earlier this month. Loved this place, friendly staff (even sent a free glass of wine up to my room), very cool room with great bed, awecome bathroom with a GREAT shower, multiple electric outlets (with US, UK and Euro plugs) and USB ports at the work surface, a nice little couch at the window with motorized shades, etc.   Good location in upscale area of Belgravia, very posh neighborhood."
November 2017,Perfection !,Fantastic stay with lots of personal touches and everything was perfect from the moment we arrived.   The food and drinks have been well thought out and served to a high standard with a prompt efficient service   The team are friendly and very welcoming   All the small touches made our stay perfect can’t wait to return 
November 2017,"Fantastic hotel, fantastic staff","My wife and I stayed in the hotels last night for an overnight stay and dined in the restaurant. The service from each and every member of staff was flawless. The food competes with the very best Italian restaurants in London. The turbot was very special indeed and huge. The cocktail waiter is an artist!   This is one of the coolest and most comfortable hotels in London.   Thanks to the whole team there! Stephanie Butler, the welcome you laid on for us was very much appreciated. "
November 2017,Fabulous! Perfect! Friendly!,"This is absolutely PERFECT as far as hotels go and probably the friendliest staff I've ever encountered ANYWHERE! Just amazing folks!! Possibly my only gripe would be the room size (but I did take the cheapest room on offer, I didnt travel light and it IS London - so I possibly shouldn't be complaining!)  They've gone the extra mile - -Sweet goodies daily (that weren't repeated during my 5 day stay) -Rooms done twice a day -A mobile for use during your stay with internet -Early check in and late check out without any haggling involved -An umbrella in each room and then some at the entrance  -Staff that had me wishing I didn't have to leave!  I will be back.  ...in a heartbeat! "
November 2017,AB,"The Hari, Simply the best hotel in London. All the staff unbelievably friendly and helpful, no matter the request.  Ben the Concierge is a legend within the industry and can cater for any request for the out of town visitor. He even managed to persuade the chef to extend breakfast, not an easy task. Our room was perfect, clean and allowed for a relaxed nights sleep. Views over central London add to the pleasure. Great cocktails and excellent food, both in the restaurant and room service. I cannot fault this wonderful hotel and will stay there at the next possible opportunity.  All in all a ten out of ten experience. The staff are the core here and you can tell they enjoy looking after their guests. A refreshing change to some operators, hence this review. Enjoy "
November 2017,Great spot,"Wonderful friendly staff, polite, professional and considerate. Alex Cohen on the front desk was great.   Couldn’t have picked a better spot for a Solo bday trip (I got a happy bday champagne and brownies from the staff, along with a parting gift).  Cutest outdoor space on the 1st floor bar/lounge.  Highly recommended. "
November 2017,Good Position,"Nice staff on reception and a nice hotel in a great position between knightsbridge and Sloan Square. Easy for shopping, eating and museums. great beds very comfortable but the noise late in the evening when trying to sleep was a pain in the backside.   The hotel seems to attract a group of guys with great high powered cars who like to rev them up and drive around like nutters at 2am in the morning not great for any of the residents local or in the hotel. The hotel should do more to distance themselves from this group as it will cost them in the long run.  The breakfast was also only average nice staff but basic fair for a five star hotel."
November 2017,Impeccable little hotel in Belgravia,My husband always stays in this little gem and has always been very well looked after.  I stayed for one night and I was pleasantly surprised with their contemporary but warm and refined decoration and the kindness of the staff.  I am looking forward to staying here again.
November 2017,Wonderful,"The hotel is terrifically located, staff is extremely helpful and pleasant.  The rooms are super clean. The restaurant offers a nice breakfast.  This boutique hotel has a slick design.  I am a regular guest and never thought of changing it"
November 2017,Was a amazing night ,"I knew that if I wanna have a good night with a highly comfortable bed I have to go to Hari Hotel, it wasn’t cheap but worth every penny, they treat you as a king with their unique style and comfort you will have a great experience to remember forever "
September 2017,Excellent service - went above and beyond,"I booked a very last minute one-night stay here for last Saturday night. I actually live very close by but I was looking for a change of scenery for my husband and I after we got some bad news this week. Having got a very good deal on booking.com, I wanted to ensure we didn't end up in a bad room (as is unfortunately often the case), so I contacted the hotel before our arrival to make a few requests (high floor, quiet room, view etc.). The response I got from the hotel, particularly the head of guest services, was almost overwhelming. We were taken care of in a way I haven't really experienced before... and we have stayed in some pretty nice places in our time. Hats off to this city hotel for providing a personal touch you don't often see in city hotels. The room, while not…"
September 2017,Quick Layover,This modern hotel is in an excellent central location close to Sloane Square.  The room was clean and functional.  The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.  The breakfast as decent if not exceptional.  
August 2017,Great first impression!,"This review is a copy of the email that I sent to the hotel's General Manager after my stay:  I recently had the pleasure of staying a the Hari for a week while I was in London on a business trip.  I travel to London a few times a year and like to check out the different preferred hotels in our company’s program.  On past visits I’ve stayed at the St. James, Goring and Mondrian.  To be honest, I fell in love with the Mondrian earlier this year and thought it would be my default hotel for future visits.  Our office is at Canary Wharf so you can’t beat the location.   However, on my trip last month I stayed for 7 nights at the Hari.  I was intrigued by the extremely positive TripAdvisor reviews.    I don’t usually write an email to the General Manager after a stay but wanted to…"
July 2017,Magnificent Boutique Hotel in heart of London,"I have been coming to the Hari (formerly The Belgraves) for a few years now and absolutely love this intimate boutique hotel, which i clearly consider my home in London, and has been getting better and better. From the second I enter the beautiful, art filled lobby, every single staff member is polite, gracious and goes the distance to make me feel welcome and proactively respond to all my needs. Rooms are well sized, extremely conformable, stylish and it is very easy & intuitive to use everything. Bathrooms are specklessly clean and i must say i really enjoy the Noble Isle Bathroom amenities. Beside the bed there is a small portable Handy Phone with free local and international calls, internet and 3G for us to use throughout their stay, and this is really useful! The free Wifi…"
September 2017,An amazing Gem of a hotel in Knightsbridge ,"I stayed at The Hari for business. What a great stay I had. The welcome from the concierge at the door was warm and friendly and the two guys who checked me in really knew their stuff and were very polite and friendly.   Great room. Funky and cool with the most comfortable bed.   The restaurant rocked great food and drinks served by a trendy Barman and waiter.   Checking out today it was raining and cold so I was offered a warm coffee to go and then I was offered an umbrella but I said no as I wasn't returning and he said no problem you can take one, nice touch.   A really good stay and I would really recommend it for anyone visiting london for business or leisure. "
September 2017,"Fabulous welcome , fantastic hotel",Great location  great staff. Jack the bellman welcome us by out name!!! We where impresed  from the beggining!!! The receptionist was very nice aswell Charlie i belive. We where there  for my birthday and she knew and she  welcome me with happy birthday! The room was  clean and welcoming. We found a botlle of champagne and a good cake and in the plate was written  happy birthday!!! We went down  to the italian  restaurant where Giampiero seat us and made our evening excelent.   Thank you Hari team for everything.  I will stay again here for sure!!! 
September 2017,Beautiful and Mesmerizing,"I was first greeted by charlie, the beautiful woman at the counter after witnessing an authentic and lavish reception room. A perfect start to my hotel experience which i must say was wonderful. The rooms, the staff and most of all the service and food was exceptional. If i was lucky enough to have business in the area again i know who i will be booking my room with."
September 2017,Home away from Home,"The Hari is and will always be my preferred hotel in London. The location is excellent, the staffs are simply out of this world (Brilliant). It is our home away from home; even my 2 year old daughter acts as such. "
August 2017,Hotel experience,"The rooms are very stylish, but small. The shower door in our suite wasn't tight and after taking a shower we had lots of water on the floor. Bed was very comfortable, hotel is in the heart of London's best area. Nice restaurant downstairs. Staff is very friendly and helpful. "
September 2017,Would have liked more time,This was a 1 night stay and unfortunately we had little time to explore the hotel.  I found the hotel very pleasant a great room well  equipped  All the staff were very helpful.  Only minor issue was that the hotel was a bit warm for us
June 2017,Fantastic Find!,"Having never visited London, I was unsure of where to stay but knew I wanted to be in a fairly central location to have access to shops, tourist sites, restaurants, etc. I had considered an airbnb but kept coming back to the Hari's website with the beautiful rooms and so I took a chance and booked it. My husband and I were not disappointed! The rooms were beautifully appointed with waters and delightful chocolates placed on each end table. Every convenience for our stay was available including US/EU ports, converters, telephone chargers, dental kits and more! The beds were lovely and the hotel was extremely well insulated against any noise. We were able to walk to an amazing restaurant in this district without difficulty and the area is truly lovely. As previously mentioned by…"
June 2017,Couldn't have been better!,"We had an wonderful stay in an amazing room and were very impressed with the service we received from the time we arrived to the time we left.  All of the staff were extremely friendly and welcoming, and a special mention for the concierges who were very attentive and couldn't have been more helpful. The hotel is in a great location, within walking distance of the nearest tube station. A very memorable stay, thank you so much!"
June 2017,Home Away From Home,"Staying at the Hari was like finding a ""new home""!!!  Everyone from the front doorman to the concierge (and everyone in between) was so inviting and welcoming and warm!  They went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed.....including a birthday celebration for my fiance!  Amazing place to stay.....you never want to leave!"
June 2017,Best hotel in London,"I looked both on airbnb and various hotel sites and kept coming back to the Hari, so I booked it. The hotel was roughly the same price as the airbnbs in the area. Having selected the latter last visit, we were so glad we had the opportunity to check out this fantastic boutique hotel. It was the best stay we've had in our many trips to London.   The service was amazing, all staff were so helpful and attentive.   The room was small but that's London. It was beautifully furnished. We had a cute little balcony with great views across London. The bed was super comfy and the room so quiet. The bathroom was marble and also very tasteful. It's going to be my  go to every time I visit London. "
June 2017,Pleasant stay at a pleasant place,"We did enjoy our stay from the very beginning to the very end. The ambiance of this place thrives on its stylish yet subtle interior design, on the room fragrances , the flower decor and modern paintings, and, most important, on the friendliness and extreme positive attitude of The Hari Team. We knew beforehand that the rooms were not very big, but their interior design is top (except: we do prefer showers to bath tubs). The location is perfect in Belgravia, a high level residential area, bus, tube and good restaurants are within tolerable walking distance, and Knightsbridge with Harrods, Harvey Nichols, other major department stores and high end fashion boutiques is a 15 mn walk away. If you are on the lookout for busier places South Kensington and Sloane Square are close. If…"
June 2017,"Excellent hotel in London, great location, amazing customer service! Highly recommended!","Lovely charming hotel, very well located (walking distance from Knightsbridge), excellent service. We have been warmly welcomed and, despite the late hours, we could still have dinner in the Italian restaurant (nice food!); room has the ""London"" sizes however the king size bed makes the difference. Rooms are equipped as in a 5stars hotel (you have everything you need for a short or long stay). It worth to underline the high level of service provided: the staff, and I really mean all of them, are amazing! Everything was simply perfect and they really made our stay memorable! Highly recommended."
June 2017,50th birthday ,"Just finished a weekend here for my wife and her twin sisters 50th birthday. We cannot fault this hotel in any. From the moment you arrive the experience is just perfect. There's none of the tourist nonsense with overdressed doormen or super trendy shoreditch posing with over trendy staff and ridiculously dark rooms.  The hotel is modern, the rooms large and clean, the beds super comfy, shower and bath amazing, food gorgeous but most of all the staff are friendly, polite and efficient. the best hotel experience  I've had in a very long time. "
June 2017,Highly recommended!,"We have just returned from my first ever visit to London and was fortunate enough to stay in a few of London's most famous hotels. We ended my London trip with The Hari and although we had not heard of this property previously we had heard and read some great reviews. Well, needless to say we were not disappointed! From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were simply pampered beyond belief. Our stay was curated by the wonderful Joanna who looked after our every need and desire. Our welcome amenities were thought-out and unique including the ever so delicious locally baked cronuts! Yummy! The room and furnishings were well designed and arranged and clearly every detail had be thought through. There were thoughtful surprises everywhere we turned in the room. The bath…"
June 2017,Choose Hari!,This hotel is a gem! The staff is amazing in a day they know you by name and make you feel like you are their most important customer.The location is excellent ;we walked to almost everything we wanted to see. I would stay there again in a heart beat. 
June 2017,The Hari Suite is Spectacular,"I travel frequently on business to London and some of the meetings can bring on unnecessary anxiety.  I arrived on a 6:30 morning flight, had to get ready at the airport to attend a 8:30 meeting in Mayfair.  The meeting was excruciatingly painful, but to my surprise, when I arrived to the Hotel Hari at about 6:30 pm I was greeted with a great surprise that I had been upgraded to the Hari Suite and the issues that I was having during the day, totally disappeared.  The Suite, designed by Tara Bernerd is an understated, comfortable sitting room and separate bedroom with powder room, free-standing bar, fireplace and small balconettes.  The coloration of the fabrics are a series of sophisticated jewel tones and luxurious velvets.  The master bathroom was generous and well appointed. …"
August 2017,Excellent weekend night,"Had a wonderful time at the Hari ! I spent a night for a special night with my family and everything was perfect. The room was beautiful, the staff really kind and attentive. The emplacement is perfect, in the heart of Belgravia. This hotel is a really welcoming place that I will definitely recommend !!"
August 2017,Beyond Expectations,"Just returned from a fabulous 2 night stay at The Hari.  Having normally leaned towards the 'bigger brand' name hotel, this came as a complete surprise, and the level of service that we received was second to none.  From the concierge contacting us personally beforehand, a few days prior to arrival, to the late check out granted to us when departing- everything ran smoothly.  All staff that we encountered were superb!  At check in (where they greeted us by name before we even told them), to the incredible welcome gifts for my three year old daughter (and champagne for us) when we went to our room, these touches made the stay incredibly memorable for us, and we will be sure to return without a doubt.  The whole team there take an immense pride in their work which was reflected in…"
June 2017,Excellent weekend!,"Stylish and expensive hotel, very good location, friendly staff at the restaurant il Pampero: the Italian antipasto was nice, excellent coffee. Quiet room, great newspaper selection, disappointed by the staff at the reception!"
August 2017,Class,"Exceptional.   The Hari Hotel is located in an excellent location, away from the hustle and bustle but in the heart of Knightsbridge. Located close to great amenities (i.e. Harrods, Sloane Street, Hyde Park..etc).   The most exceptional part of the hotel are the staff. The staff are excellent and very friendly!   The rooms are stylish with lovely marble bathrooms.   Overall, the location was also key, very residential and quiet. Room was large, clean and extremely comfortable and most importantly the staff were great! We shall return.  Thanks."
August 2017,Amazing boutique hotel with the friendliest servicing team!  ,"Stayed in London for 3 days. A friend recommended this area and we picked the Hari. Best decision ever!   All of their staff are great, cannot be friendlier! Even guy at the Italian restaurant made me a coffee to go, when I asked to pay, he just said ""it's on the house, have a good day"". That coffee may not cost a lot, but the generosity and his heart to make my day is priceless!   Thank you The Hari! I'll definitely stay here again if I come to London.   "
September 2016,Stylish hotel,One of my favorites in London- simply because everyone working there is so friendly! The rooms are stylish with lovely marble bathrooms. What I do not like is that you can hear almost everything from neighbor rooms and the hall. The service is amazing! The staff is truly trying their best in order to make your stay memorable and pleasant.
July 2017,Excellent staff,The hotel was an enjoyable short walk from either Sloane square or Knightsbridge tube stations(very interesting to walk past the expensive properties with fancy sports cars outside). It overlooks a garden square and is in a quiet location. The staff are outstanding and it has a great atmosphere. Very comfortable bed. Slightly tired looking furniture e.g.  the windowseat but that didn't worry me as the bathroom was immaculate !
July 2017,A PERFECT TIME IN LONDON!,"The Hari Hotel really has its act together, and for such a stylish small hotel, it was pure perfection. The staff was truly outstanding, from front desk, doorman, and our waiter at breakfast remembering my cherished caffe latte! Location was also key, very residential and quiet. Room was large, clean and extremely comfortable. We shall return. Thank you everyone at The Hari, you made our trip to Wimbledon an amazing experience!!"
May 2017,"Cozy, Happy, and Comfotable","I have been to the Hari many times and have always loved it. I think that it is very cozy, comfortable and is definently worth the money. The staff is always kind and very helpful. When I go to London I will only stay at the Hari."
July 2017,The difference between fake and real,"You know how you can tell the difference between real service and fake service? Look at how service folk are when they're with one another and not with you. It's a treat to watch! But I'm getting ahead of myself - service here is extraordinary. So extraordinary that you take it for granted. I woke up late on the day after my last day of work. Had had a little too much to drink the previous night and staggered down for breakfast. Usual courteous service, take your time to work out what you want, would you like a coffee while you wait? A double macchiato? No problem. Changed your mind? Don't want breakfast, not a problem and of course we won't charge you for the coffee. And it wasn't just me - there was a fire in the building next door and one of the occupants of the apartment…"
August 2017,The staff of the hotel is really treasure,The hotel rooms is nice and clean as any 5 stars hotel the location is one of top in London but the really treasure they have is the personal they work at the hotel I mean all the staff from the bell boy to house keepers and in between like the reception the room service and the people in nicely restaurant plus they have the best donuts you could have in London at the hotel cafe I enjoyed with my family all moments there and I Strongly recommend these hotel and will voting for hari to best hotel in London 2017
August 2017,Perfect in every way,"I booked this hotel for my boyfriends 21st birthday and it was the best present he said he could have asked for! I chose this hotel based on its location and great reviews and it didnt disappoint. From the minute we arrived we were made to feel so welcome and every member of staff we met was so friendly!  I mentioned it was my boyfriends birthday when bookingp and when we arrived there was a cake,champagne and balloons in the room...we were blown away with the effort they went to to make our stay special.  Everything was spotlessly clean and breakfast was superb.   Thank you, we will definitely be returning!"
August 2017,There is no words to describe how wonderful is the hotel,I advise everyone to stay at the Hari . this hotel is the best in Lonodn . I have stayed there many times during summer . since 2011  every summer I noticed that the hotel is improving and they have the best hospitality service to their guest .  The staff are amazing from the doorman to the Manager who welcome me back by sending a letter to my room with desert .
August 2017,Disappointed,"On arriving at the hotel the concierge and receptionist were very polite and helpful although our rooms were not ready, we were early, they took our bags and said they would phone when the room was ready. We had a missed call from the hotel at 16.06,We went off to explore and on return to the hotel around 5.30 a different receptionist was not very helpful and seemed confused over our booking. We got the keys for both rooms and the porter then fetched our bags we were surprised they had not been already taken up. On arrival in the rooms we discovered they weren't interconnecting which we had telephoned to check on earlier in the week and been told they would be connecting. The reception was not very helpful, and rambled on about only been told from booking. Com today at 2 that we…"
August 2017,Great stay!,"Really nice small hotel - and the location is great too! Good value for money in every way, but especially the service was outstandinh - personnel kept on suprising my son with cookies, activity packages and such ❤️"
June 2017,A top hotel in a top aera,"We were looking for a good hotel near Sloane Square, to visit the Chelsea Flower Show. With  The Hari we have been very happy. The location, the friendly staff and the clean room did help to make our trip to London a big hit. Next time we visit London, we will defenately return to The Hari. A hotel we can recommand also to our friends. Barbara and Chris from Switzerland"
May 2017,Morning of my Wedding,"The Hari looked after me and my family in a way I could only have dreamed about! I called them in advance of my stay to say I would be using the hotel to get ready for my wedding. From that moment onwards I received 5 star treatment! I checked in early  the day before my wedding (around 12pm, with no prior notice). Upon arrival the staff at the Reception desk were so excited to meet me and offered me a drink in the lobby whilst my room was been prepared! They told me they had a surprise for me: The surprise was an amazing room upgrade! My sister and her husband were allocated a room next to mine. My room had a fireplace, drinks bar, Marble bathroom and beautiful views of London. It was the perfect room to get ready in prior to my wedding. There was even a bottle of champagne…"
June 2017,Great boutique property,Wonderful staff who provide warm and efficient service. Everyone was so helpful from the moment I stepped out of my uber. I also like the area which is quiet yet close to everything. Easy walk or uber to everything I needed. Only complaint is the lighting system in the room. Could use some dimmers but not a deal breaker at all!
May 2017,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"This is a great small hotel in a great location in Knightsbridge. it is literally 5 minutes walk from Harrods and Harvey Nicholls stores and all the designer shops in Sloane Street. We were visiting the Chelsea Flower Show and again the hotel was very close being a twenty minute walk. The hotel itself is very nicely fitted out although as with most London hotels the rooms are not huge. However, we had a premium king room on the fifth floor and is was very nice and a reasonable size. Wifi was included free.   The hotel had a very nice restaurant 'Il Pampero' which was excellent. Good food and good service. Similarly, breakfast which was not included was freshly cooked and to a very nice standard and again service was good. We had a drink in the first floor bar most evenings and…"
May 2017,The Hari Hotel,"The Hari has it all: great room, outstanding service, centrally located, fantastic staff, the best, most experienced and helpful Concierge we have ever had the pleasure to work with. Oh, and by the way, the best.shower.ever. Ten nights of comfort and convenience. We will always stay at The Hari when in London."
May 2017,Loved our stay!,"Bathtub!  Personal controlled AC!  Room service!  Comfy bed!  All top on our list.  Loved the area, loved the staff, everything was clean, lovely, easy and a great little cocktail bar too.  I will be back.  I was visiting my daughter who is studying abroad and we both enjoyed our stay.  Wonderful little places to eat close by too.  And room service was available too."
May 2017,Great hotel in great neighborhood.,"The British hospitality in it's best, we stay there 3 nights and joy every moment, super profetional stuff, they take care of you like you are the only one at the hotel, rooms are sparkling clean and roomy, we travel alots around the world, this is definitely on our top 10....!!!!"
May 2017,The Hari,"The hotel is beautifully decorated and our room was lovely too. Staff were attentive, friendly and helpful. We ate in the restaurant too, again lovely staff and beautifully decorated, food was lovely."
May 2017,Great hotel,"Big welcome, knowledgeable & helpful staff. Compact site but everything was there-intimate terrace, good Italian restaurant, well appointed lounge-sitting room-bar area where groups could socialize also small nooks for quiet reading."
May 2017,Hidden gem in a fabulous location ,"Love this boutique hotel! I only got to stay one night as part of a business/leisure trip but wish I could have stayed longer.  The decor is very nice, the bedrooms are fairly small as is normal for London but they are well set out and spotless. The concierge knew I was going for a run the next morning and recommended a juice for when I got back. Sure enough, I returned and room service delivered the juice complimentary - fantastic personalised touch, thank you Ricardo!  The rest of the team were excellent and I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. The location is brilliant, within walking distance to Sloane Street, Harrods, Hyde Park and bus/tube.  I will definitely be back. "
June 2017,Fantastic Wimbledon Trip,"I recently stayed at The Hari for my trip to Wimbledon and did not know what to expect as I booked my whole trip including my hotel via a tour group.  I am accustomed to staying in mostly 5 star hotels and I will tell you The Hari hotel was amazing.  The service was exceptional - the concierge staff arranged everything from airport transfers to hair appointments and were very prompt in responding to all of my requests.  The doormen and bellmen were extremely polite and always provided me with directions to everything from a local hangout to a preferred jogging route.  The room service was excellent and always timely.  While I did not eat in the restaurant, I often had appetizers and drinks in the bar area and the service was outstanding.  The rooms were modern and very…"
August 2017,Amazing stay and great staff!,"I've stayed at The Hari in London already a couple of times on a business trip and I absolutely loved it!! The Staff go out of their way to ensure you have a fabulous stay at this hotel. From the greetings at the door (I believe it was Ricardo) to the welcome at the restaurant, the people at this hotel really make the difference. Elena and Gianni at the restaurant were tremendous hosts and they advised on a great risotto with seafood! Also the room was very charming and with a wonderful view. Last but not least, the cocktails at the bar were delicious. Alessandro is the master behind the bar and he knows his job really well (not only in terms of good drinks, but it is also a pleasure looking at his choreography when preparing it!). Thank you all for the great stay! See you next…"
August 2017,Great stay,Everything was perfect. Woul highly recommend everyone who comes to London to stay here.  The staffs attention  to detail is great.  Really good location if u want to be near everything.  Rooms were very nice inside
August 2017,Overnight stay for a birthday celebration.,"The Hari was an ideal choice for an overnight stay for a birthday celebration in London. The room we had was spacious, of an excellent standard and was very quiet and restful. This was complemented by a large, very comfortable bed.The modern bathroom was a good size and had quality complimentary toiletries. Like many other reviewers, the stand out feature of this hotel, for me, is the attentiveness of the staff. Nothing was too much trouble. From the moment you walk into the hotel everyone is there to help and ensure that you get the best possible experience - including members of the management team, who are often not visible in larger establishments. We had a most enjoyable stay and will definitely return."
June 2017,Enjoyable Stay at The Hari,The Staff at The Hari in London go out of their way to ensure you have a fabulous stay at this hotel.  You are greeted at the door by the smiling Doorman and walk into a spacious and appealing foyer.  At reception they will try their best to cater for your needs.  The room was clean and lovely.  The bed was comfy and restful.  The bathroom is not overly large but was clean with a large shower.   We had drinks at the bar and we were offered a antipasto plate complimentary with our drinks. It was delicious.  We did not dine at this hotel but found a gorgeous cafe for breakfast just down the road.  The location worked well for Us as it was just a little bit away from the main hustle & bustle. But walking distance to Harrods and lots of shopping. We would be happy to return to The…
July 2017,Excellent,"A perfect small hotel in delightful Belgravia. Staff was excellent & accommodating in every way. Rooms were clean, food delicious, and the staff was some of the finest I have encountered. Many thanks! Will return!"
June 2017,Excellent stay,"I have been coming to London for years and have stayed at a lot of hotels.  I would highly recommend this Hari  Great location, excellent service, great rooms, great vibe.  I'm staying here again next trip to London.   '"
July 2017,The right size at the right place,I have stayed for two nights in a regular room. It had all you need for a business trip. The restaurant for launch was very good (Italian). I had some time so I took their bicycle for a ride (great!). The staff is professional with a smile! Will come again for sure 
July 2017,What a fabulous place to stay at in London!,"Location, food, room, staff were all excellent. We had an amazing 5 days there. All of the staff-restaurant, front desk, bell hop, concierge, front door--all worked very hard to make our stay a delightful one. The A/C was great, appointments in the room were top notch, especially the portable phone to use around London. This was a wonderful stay and we travel all over the world. Keep up your high standards, Hari. You're doing great!"
May 2017,Fantastic,"Perfectly located within Belgravia! The staff are friendly and the in-situ Italian restaurant exceeded expectations. Definitely a memorable hotel! what really convinced my stay here is that they have plenty of areas to relax outside your room, sofas, plush chairs and of the garden terrace!"
July 2017,Excellent,"Very personable and helpful .    Prime area. Quiet, but accessible to walk or public transportation. Staff could not have been more friendly or helpful.   Restaurant was very good as well. Enjoyed the whole experience    I would definately stay here again  "
June 2017,Exceptionalism,Great hotel amazing location. So close to Sloane square and Harvey Nichols.  Staff were extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  Great restaurant bin walking distance of the hotel The decor was wonderful. And the nightly sweets on my pillow was a nice touch.?
July 2017,Contemporary Gem ,Excellent service as they have a gang of staff to greet you each time you walk in the door.  The concierge helped us get some hard to get tickets.  Great bar and restaurant.  In a nice quiet neighborhood to get you away from the bustle of London.  Be sure to request upper floor rooms as the second floor can be loud due to their atrium bar.   We were on the third floor and heard nothing but our traveling companions were in the second floor and could hear the noise.  Otherwise I highly recommend the hotel 
July 2017,Faultless....,I can honestly say I could not think of anything I'd change. A special mention to the hotel staff as are the most welcoming I have come across. It is a true gem in a lovely part of London. We will be back soon....
June 2017,Highly recommended,"Convenient location in Belgravia, nice rooms with views of London and very friendly and attentive staff. told them I was graduating and they surprised us with a good bottle of champagne in the room. Won't forget it, thanks!"
May 2017,Exceptional service!,"Spent four days at The Hari and were very impressed by the exceptional service. Unfortunately, I lost my Iphone in a cab but the outstanding concierge, Ben, went out of his way to help locate it and have it shipped to our next destination in England. Rare have I seen such a high level of service. Rooms, lobby and decor were equally noteworthy!"
May 2017,Faultless ,My husband and I have just left this hotel after an overnight stay and it is was with  a heavy heart as we checked out.  Having never dreamt id stay in Belgravia  ( always thinking it was above our every day normal working couples budget lol) i stumbled upon the London Hari. As it was a special occasion  I decided to up my budget and stay In this 325 per night room. Most friends thought I was mad as this neither included dinner or breakfast. In arrival we thought the entrance to the hotel was stunning and the staff immediately on entering polite and helpful. Our room wasn't ready as we had  arrived at 10 am ( early flight) our cases were stored and we went out exploring. When  we arrived back we found that our room had been upgraded due to it being our anniversary and also…
May 2017,What a find !!,"We stumbled upon the Hari Restaurant - Il Pampero - by chance; the Rib Room at the Carlton Towers being unexpectedly closed and we were searching around after an exhausting Chelsea Flower Show day. We had no prior booking, but at 8.45 pm the greeting was welcoming and we were promptly seated despite the restaurant being very busy. All the staff were exceptionally friendly, professional and efficient. The food was excellent with strong Italian overtones.The furnishings are modern and warm, the ambiance lovely.The atmosphere is very relaxing. We loved everything about the place - it was very good and we thoroughly recommend it, even though expensive"
May 2017,Best hotel service I ever received!,"My husband and I stayed at the Hari May 8 through May 15, 2017.  They exceeded our expectations with their friendly staff and hotel amenities.  We ended most evenings with a glass of wine at their restaurant bar because the bartenders were so sociable.  We totally appreciated their complimentary smart phone with free internet..  The treats left on our beds each night were incredible!  Everyone was exceptionally attentive from the front desk to the doorman.  We will be back again as soon as we replenish our vacation fund!"
May 2017,Value for your money!,"This is a fantastic hotel close to both Knightsbridge and Sloan square tube station. It is walking distance from Hyde Park and Harrods. Sloan street is a beautiful shopping street that is also close by. The Hotel itself provide excellent customer service, the front desk staff is extremely friendly and helpful and so are all the staff. The restaurant offers great food and the staff advised us off the card with delicious specials, again the service here is excellent. In the morning you can have an excellent breakfast in the same restaurant where you can order several additions. The rooms are spacious and the turn down service is outstanding. The hotel staff has an excellent eye for detail which include a complimentary bottle of water every day (one per person staying). The beds…"
May 2017,Fantastic location!,Right in the heart of the beautiful and quiet Belgravia streets. It's the ideal place to stay in London and well placed for the Chelsea Flower Show which was our reason for staying. Very friendly and helpful staff. Cannot really fault it! 
May 2017,"Nice, quiet, very good service","Great experience at the Hari, despite a couple of glitches, which were quickly fixed. Our room was quite small, but well designed & efficient. We had a temporary Internet outage for a few hours, and a glitch with the house phone that wouldn't stop beeping, but the professional staff were very good in clearing things up, and also very helpful when we lost our mobile phone. Hotel is very quiet, yet centrally located. Would definitely go back."
April 2017,Amazing Jewel in a Sea of Shells - Stay Here and You'll Never want to leave!,"Amazing Jewel in a Sea of Shells - Stay Here and You'll Never want to leave!  Why do I say this?  Because it is so true!  As a frequent business traveler, you want a few things:  A comfortable, clean bed/room to sleep in, a quiet hallway, great wifi and amazing customer service.  To be honest, I am usually happy with 2 out of the 4.  NO hotel...I mean not one, has ever managed to do all these things - and more...until I stayed at the Hari.  What an amazing experience.  The staff was so welcoming since the moment I arrived.  My room was not ready, but they quickly took my bags, gave me a drink and told me to relax.  They offered to let me know via phone if I wanted to go shop (BONUS:  this place is closely located to some of the best shopping in the world).  I opted to relax in…"
May 2017,What a gem!,"Great location, gave us accesses to Knightsbridge and Sloane Square on different lines. Gets you almost anywhere. Rooms were cosy and every detail was thought through (like having enough space for toiletries in the bathroom). Staffs made me feel welcomed whenever I get back and anything we asked through concierge or housekeeping, was provided for without any delay. In fact, when we asked for ice, they delivered so quick, we couldn't believe ourselves. That made us feel special although it was a mere simple request. Will def return when I'm back in London."
May 2017,Excellent hotel in good location,"Regarding our 7-day stay at the Hari... Quiet but convenient location: Sloan Square tube station, restaurants, shopping all within a 15 minute walk. All staff are exceptionally pleasant and helpful. Had a King Deluxe room--very nicely done and includes a free cell phone (mobile) so you can avoid paying the ridiculous international phone fees. On-site restaurant (Il Pompero: high end Italian) and mezzanine level bar both very good. Have traveled in England and Europe a lot over the years and this is one of the best hotels we have stayed in."
June 2017,Nice Hotel,"Nice hotel, Staff is very helpful and friendly. The hotel are in the heart of Belgravia, It's close to Sloane Square, Kings Rd and Brompton Rd. They have a small gym, nice restaurant. There are stable wirless internet access."
June 2017,Fantastic stay,We had a wonderful stay in The Hari and we booked another stay in that hotel for the end of the year. Fir us it is the best hitel in London and the staff is incredibely friendly . A very specual thanks to Joanna! 
May 2017,Amazing staff and hotel!,"I'm a little late in my review - My wife and I stayed at the Hari in May for a quick vacation in London.  Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by Simone at the front desk who made us feel welcome immediately.  We had mentioned the plan to take the Thames water bust o Greenwich the next day to sightsee, and she surprised us in the morning with at the most wonderful bag of lunch and snacks, which made the ideal day a perfect day.  Everyone we met at the hotel made us feel as though we were home, comfortable and welcome.    It really is the small things that make the difference, and our experience at the Hari shows they understand this.  We only had one night where we stopped by the bar, and the bartender turned us on to fantastic vodka from the Czech Republic that we never would…"
February 2017,Amazing!!,"I went here with my boyfriend for my birthday. He had arranged a breakfast in the room with the staff. The staff was really wonderfull, making sure it was all ready. They even bring balloons to my room. When we came back to the hotel in the evening, we got a bottle of champagne as a gift. They really went beyond to make my day a really special one!"
June 2017,Great atmosphere,"I have stayed at the Hari hotel during my business trip to London. The location is perfect, beautiful area and great proximity to the Victoria Station, Sloan Sq, etc with many very nice restaurants and pubs around. The hotel itself has a very nice atmosphere, good bar. The rooms are cozy and very stylish. Friendly and helpful staff. Overall, a great experience."
May 2017,Beyond Expectations,"Man. I don't even know where to start. Booked this place based on previous reviews and I so wasn't disappointed. It looked a bit expensive before getting there but once u reach u see what you're paying for. We went to London with our 4 year old as she is crazy about Peppa Pig and found this boutique hotel nestled between Harrods and Buckingham.  The whole experience was just fantabulous. Ben and his team take really good care of you.  1. From the moment you step on the porch, you can forget about your bags. The front bell desk staff are too nice and courteous. They can't seem to stand you carrying bags :) 2. You get a free ""handy phone"". Thats right.. All the data and local calls that you want. Absolutely free. 3. The Location is just perfect. Its central yet far away from all…"
June 2017,The Best,"The Hari is one of the best hotels, great position, walking distance to Sloane Sq. & Knightsbridge.The reception staff are a credit to themselves and the hotel. Breakfast was good, as were the staff. The bar/ lounge area is very comfortable and welcoming. "
June 2017,Fantastic!,"My husband and I stayed at the Hari while on our honeymoon, and had a perfect stay! The hotel staff was extremely nice and accommodating. They gave us a free room upgrade and delivered champagne to our suite. The room itself was very comfortable and relaxing. "
June 2017,"Chic, Comfortable Oasis","My husband and I just returned from five nights at the Hari.  We had a most excellent experience.  We ended up eating three dinners at the Italian restaurant there because it was such good food.  We also enjoyed the food upstairs in the Bar which was better for lunch time or an afternoon cocktail/tea/snack sort of thing.  Our room was not huge, but it was very comfortable and very chic.  The service throughout the hotel, including the restaurants, the front desk, the concierge, the housekeeping and the maintenance staff, was consistently excellent.  I personally have not visited London that much recently, so it was nice to be at a small hotel where we were made to feel cosy and welcome.  My husband, who is an architect, was particularly impressed by how much thoughtfulness had…"
June 2017,5*,"Amazing boutique hotel in heart of Belgravia not far from anything including Hyde Park, Westminster, Victoria, Kensington, Knightsbridge... Great quality rooms, beds, bathrooms, service, bar, fitness center, ... Not exactly bargain priced but, for London, worth it. Nice vibe, feel and atmosphere."
May 2017,One of my top 5 London Hotels,"We stayed at the Hari for one night while enjoying a weekend in London to shop and eat.  We booked a King deluxe room based on the reasonable price in comparison to other 5 star hotels we stay at. Also the excellent location for shopping at Harrods, Kings Road and Harvey Nichols.   We arrived and were greeted with an exceptionally warm welcome and instantly hit it off with Nicole.  She was the perfect balance of warmth, friendliness, fun and professional. We chatted about our plans for the weekend amount other things.  Later that evening we had a knock at the door and received a tray with items crafted out of chocolate that related to our earlier chats with Nicole, it was such a surprise and so touching, thoughtful and personal to us, unlike general box of truffles etc.  We were…"
November 2016,Pleasantly surprised!,"The Hari is a very cozy hotel in Chesham place, and it was the first time we chose it, because we like the area and we thought it was also value for money. We were more than happy with our stay! The staff was polite and accommodating, the room very pleasant, the breakfast delicious! We will definitely go back, we highly recommend it!"
May 2017,Perfect,"This is a great hotel. Well located, beautifully appointed. The staff are very friendly and were happy to assist us when required. I really couldn't fault this hotel in any way. Will definitely return."
May 2017,Great rooms and even greater service ,"The Hari was picked on a whim by my fiancé and I'm so glad he did so. Everything wonderful that you have read and heard about this hotel is true. I want to highlight a few points which were special for us. We got a free upgrade just because they had a bigger room available, after the first night.  One evening the hot water wasn't working for a few hours which frankly I don't notice. The reception sent us two drinks of our choice right and a letter saying breakfast was on the house the next morning. That was good enough but the GM also emailed us after we left to apologize about the water situation and offered us a great deal when we go back.  They used to have these delicious cookies at the reception and I'd grab a few every day. So the day were leaving I see a package with a…"
February 2017,"Amazing staff, great hotel, will keep coming back!","I booked The Hari for a business trip during the 9-12/2/17 without knowing that it was previously known as the Thompson Belgraves, which I had stayed in 2 years earlier (and loved it then as well). It was great to come back to a familiar, excellent hotel. Upon my arrival I was greeted with a refreshing cocktail and some sweets at the front desk, and as a returning customer I received a complimentary upgrade to my room.   My stay was very enjoyable, the hotel is centrally located a walking distance from major locations such as Harrods. On my last day at The Hari I went shopping with the missus and had inadvertently left my wallet on the counter at Harrods. Since I had already checked out of the hotel and rushed to the airport I figured I'd look for it thoroughly when I got back…"
May 2017,The Hari...taking sexy back.,"...a sexy chic hotel with extremely friendly and helpful staff...in a superb location to boot! Not a dream my friends ... This hotel reminds me of boutique hotels in Manhattan...a busy hive in the heart of Chelsea / Belgravia with a seriously rock chic vibe. Great decor, great colours, a bar on the first floor mezzanine ...a smokers haven on the top floor and a gym!? Sign me up! The restaurant has a healthy breakfast menu with mouthwatering choices....our room on the 8th floor had a panoramic view that I could  sit and stare at from the plush velour window seat all day long. The bathroom is huge...plenty of room for all make up pouches and the like...which believe me is not always the case.  Will we return? Darn tooting !! I loved everything about The Hari...have I stated that…"
May 2017,Amazing experience!!!,"Stayed here 2 weeks ago, great located, the hotel staff were all very attentive, great service, the decor is perfect in every detail, it's really magnificient! Highly recommended! WHAT A Gem!!! I would like to thank all the staff very much for making me spend a magical night! Over all expectations!!!"
May 2017,Happy customer! ,"Stayed here last night and I have to say from start to finish, the hotel staff were very attentive and certainly went out of their way to make the stay memorable. Stayed for my birthday and got a lovely delivery from the hotel accompanied by a sweet note. Concierge was very helpful pointing us in the direction of a very nice Indian/Pakistani restaurant close to the hotel. Room had beautiful view and was very well decorated. Would highly recommend The Hari and would definitely revisit if staying over in London again.  Thank you! :)"
May 2017,Fantastic hotel ,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 1 night stay at the Hari. The reception staff were very welcoming, warm and friendly and even arranged for Champagne and brownies to be delivered to our room on hearing it was our anniversary. Our room itself was beautiful, very spacious, luxurious and clean. We will definitely return. "
May 2017,A hidden diamond,"A Luxurious hotel over all expectations   Staid at this superb hotel with over the top staff. Greater located, for both shopping and sightseeing. All together a super experience, will come back next time visiting London.   "
June 2017,Superb Stay ,This was first time we stayed at The Hari London and what a fantastic stay it was. The rooms are extremely well equipped and very comfortable. They have a great bar and terrace on the first floor. The staff are extremely helpful and make you feel right at home. Breakfast is also fantastic unlike many other other hotels in London.   The hotel is located in one of the nicest spots in London and walking distance to many London attractions. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anybody travelling on business or leisure. We will definitely be back.   
June 2017,Deserves its good ratings,"THe Hari Hotel deserves its good ratings.  Fabulous location, thoughtful and attentive staff, comfortable, well appointed and elegant room and on top of all that in our room was a cellular phone we were welcome to call home on and use all around London.   A very appreciated perk."
June 2017,Hari london,"This is my first time visiting London. The Hari London definitely made our stay very special. The glorious staff members are there to help. The service is very attentive from check in to check out. Every evening our room was turn down, I love to come back to a beautiful room after a long day of sightseeing.  The location is great; neighborhood is so quiet and safe. Very close to transportation. Definitely recommend to stay @ the Hari London "
May 2017,A gem of a hotel,"Located in a quiet neighborhood area of Belgravia, this great hotel is located between the Sloane Park & Knightsbridge station allowing you an easy walk to either line that connects to multiple major destinations around town. We chose to stay here to ease ourselves into London after a very long flight and are so glad we did! The hotel room was beautiful with fantastic views, the staff very accommodating and informative and the ambience charming. The rooms are very new and modern with great upgrades like US plugs already installed and the Handy phone - a wonderful gadget that gives travelers free local data for phone calls and maps - a lifeline to protect us from going into overage charges.  Tip: Ask for a higher floor for a great view of the city!"
June 2017,London retreat,"Great to be back at the Hair, very attentive staff, if was only a flying visit but managed a drink in the new ground floor bar, great atmosphere. Next time we will get to dine in the intalian restaurant menu looks fab! "
June 2017,Great stay at The Hari,"I really liked my stay at The Hari, the location is great and the staff is really very nice and welcoming. Loved the Hotel´s atmosphere and the comfortable room. The bikes that the Hotel offers free of charge enabled us to experience the city in the best way possible. Special note to the Hotel´s restaurant and Bar ""Il Pampero"" - Really good Italian food and a very friendly Italian (and Portuguese) staff. Will definitely return."
June 2017,"Amazing staff, beautiful stay, tasty food","I stayed for one night in the Hari in the Penthouse suite (I'll get onto the room later). The hotel, is modern, choc and fabulous, it has a laid-back luxury vibe that's certinaly not stuffy/snobby. The staff are so friendly an willing to help - Hattie and Stefano in partocular are so personable and easy to talk to. The staff really make the stay so comfortable and almost like a second home.   The restaurant is the perfect Italian restaurant . The setting is great, but the food is incredible. I've dined at a lot of 'posh' restaurants in London and I find it hard to find a great Italian but Il Pompero is that.   The room was to die for. Balconies with incredible views of London and the interior design was so fabulous.  I couldn't have asked for a better stay - the perfect place…"
May 2017,Excellent hotel and service,"This beautiful hotel is in a great location, within walking distance to Harrods and the Hyde Park. The area feels safe and even safe enough to get the hotel bikes and bike to Hyde Park. Fantastic way to see the park. The staff were all very attentive and professional but still personal. The hotel bar service was excellent. the room was small however had all the required fittings."
June 2017,Italian Food to Die For and Cocktails of Dreams,"Wow wow and wow this place is unreal and part of me does not want to let anyone else know about it. Cocktails of such creation, Italian food to die for and having an Italian partner I class myself as informed. The staff make you feel like family not a paying guest. In the words of Alessandro the best barman in London if you come to my house why would I not serve you the best drinks and prepare the best food. It's a must place and the best Cacio e Pepe outside of Roma."
May 2017,"Great location, wonderful staff!","I have stayed at The Hari hotel a couple of times, and each time has been a fantastic experience. They have great customer service - I have often requested to stay in the same room (high floor, with view of the garden outside), and the hotel has accomodated my request each time.   The location of the hotel is perfect - it is just minutes away from Harvey Nichols and Harrods. The hotel and rooms are also designed beautifully, and the bar/lounge area is great for meeting with friends and family. What remains outstanding however, is the staff. Warm, friendly and helpful.  This is the best hotel in London, and I look forward to coming back."
April 2017,Excellent Hotel hotel in the best neighborhood,"Design hotel with great staff. Rooms are very quiet and furnished in style, although some parts need a little of renovation. The hotel has a stylish restaurant in which breakfast is served. The hotel has a terrace bar which is very nice. The only thing that misses is the Spa/massages"
April 2017,Flawless hospitality in a beautiful boutique setting,"I've stayed in more hotels than I'd like to admit. Usually my measure of a hotel is the bed, the breakfast, and the level of quiet. A rare measure of the quality of a hotel is what happens when someone makes a mistake.   In my case, a housekeeper accidentally discarded a button that had popped off a very fine pair of trousers from a shop in Mayfair. I knew I wouldn't be able to find the same button in NYC, because the store doesn't have an NYC outpost, but I also knew I couldn't spare the time to visit the shop. I explained the situation to the staff and they not only fetched the missing button from the store, but they also repaired the pants for me, and I've just returned to my room to find a lovely bottle of wine and a hand written apology card from Nicole, one of the Hari…"
April 2017,Hooray for The Hari,"Took my 17 year old son to London for spring break and we spent 4 nights at The Hari. Could not have been more pleased with our stay.  London has no shortage of hotels. Even at the high end, unless one is booking a suite and money is no object, decent-sized rooms (especially with two beds) that aren't so precious that they are intimidating are in relatively short supply. The Hari offered the perfect solution. Room was good size and contemporary in design. Our room even had a small couch constructed as a window seat and a great bathroom with separate toilet and a shower with both a standard shower head and rainfall shower head. The neighborhood is lovely with Sloane Street and Harrods just a stone's throw away.  The room had plenty of connections for recharging iPhones, iPads,…"
April 2017,Classy and stylish with a warm human touch.,Excellent staff in every way. Always helpful kind and considerate. Went the extra mile to make us welcome and comfortable. Good rooms nice restaurant. Quiet yet conveniently situated in Belgravia. Good local coffee houses. 
April 2017,"Superb, chic, design and cozy hotel in a perfect location!!!","My husband and I visited The Hari on a 4 day Holiday during the Easter break in April 2017. We were greeted very warmly by the staff on our arrival. Our room was ready even though we'd flown in very early in the morning. With a great smile at reception, Pedro made sure we would have the best room available, without us even asking (the whole staff was lovely). We got room 209, a premium king room with a perfect view of the private garden across the quiet street. Absolutely perfect! Very well soundproofed room, with efficient blackout drapes. The pics you see on the hotel website for the room is accurate. Beautiful bathroom, and very nice water pressure in the shower. Very good air conditioning system in the room, worked well and not noisy (we like our rooms very cool). The staff…"
April 2017,Two night stay,Hotel was to a very high standard without being too stuffy! First impression was very good and reception was excellent.The rooms are too a high standard not too big not too small. Breakfast was again to a high standard with excellent staff on hand.We would certainly stay there again.
February 2017,Beautiful Rooms,"I really enjoyed my stay here and particularly loved our bedroom! We had an amazing, large window overlooking London with a sofa area built into the window so we could sit and watch the world go by. It was a great experience having breakfast in the window with the sunshine pouring in. The restaurant and bar provided delicious food and drinks, but the service was quite lacking. We spent ages in the restaurant trying to catch someone's eye on various occasions and had to remind staff what we'd asked for. But overall a lovely place to stay."
April 2017,Bar,"We had an amazing evening with our friends, the bar staff were polite, quick and knowledgeable about the cocktails. Great atmosphere and will recommend to friends and family. This hotel bar is great and going places. "
April 2017,All about the service and location,"Charming location with a great homey feel. Service and staff was exceptional. Rooms are slightly small for my liking but it would do for a quick stay or opt for a larger suite. Considering its location and the experience, it was great value for money."
April 2017,"Superb hotel, excellent location!","Very friendly and professional staff! Hotel ideally located near tube stops so getting around London and beyond is very easy. Quiet neighborhood near embassies. Close to great restaurants and shopping. And far from the tourist crush..this was especially nice after dealing with the madding crowd at the tourist hotspots. Room was spacious for London, and this is one of the few hotels which can accommodate 3 people comfortably and with privacy (private bedroom with king bed, and pull out sofa in separate sitting area). Linens and towels top-notch. Excellent food and bar. Exceptional concierge service will help you craft a memorable London experience. Yes, rick steves says to stay in a B&B, but this intimate hotel is a much better option. Stay here! You will love it!"
April 2017,Brilliant Second Stay Reflects the First!,"This was our second stay at the Hari and it was like coming home.  The staff was more than helpful and attentive.  Our room was beautiful and the bed so comfortable we wanted to take it home.  Since our last visit the hotel has revamped their restaurant.  The menu was interesting and the meal delicious.  The same held true for the two room service meals we had.  Perhaps our favorite thing about the Hari is the location.  It is on a quiet street but is close to some of the best shopping in London, including Harrods.  And it is convenient to the rest of the city via The Tube."
May 2017,Excellent stay,"This was our first time in London and often when we travel we choose smaller boutique hotels which are normally known for great service without the crowds of a larger chain. The Hari is no exception to this. From check-in, the front doormen and housekeeping the friendliness and service has definitely met our expectations. There were some spotty treatment in their restaurant for breakfast but nothing to go out of our way to complain about. The bar on the other hand exceeded other bars that we tried in London. Kudos to the barman for being attentive and also going out of his way to make suggestions of where to eat in London. If we weren't staying at the hotel, the bar would've been worth the visit. Other than the service, the room was comfortable, have all the amenities you can…"
April 2017,van A-Z alles in perfectie. Led by artists of hospitality!The best in London!,"Zeer professionele check in en ontvangst.Perfect art of Welcome. High room comfort, hoge standard materialen, prachtig design, very professional service in all sences.Alles in de puntjes en details verzorgd. The Hari is a masterpiece of perfect hospitality, all the staff where driven with passion.It is an expression of love by the hotelier who above all else cherish giving themselves to others. Centrale locatie in de beste wijk. Nogmaals : for those who travel to discover something more seek the remarkably uncommon at the Hari in London. The Hari creates oases where you feel completely at home, while enabling you to move beyond your comfort zone to discover the unexpected."
March 2017,Another great stay!,"We recently enjoyed another great stay and this time we took advantage of the restaurant.  The hotel was, as always, spotlessly clean, the bar service was delivered with the usual passion and style and the restaurant delivered in bounds with a fresh and well balanced menu. The food was delicious and was matched with a generous wine cellar.  All in all, 'another great stay'....we'll be back very soon!!"
May 2017,Great hotel and quiet (and very safe) location,"I've stayed here several times (work and pleasure) and have not had a bad experience.  It's a little away from the hustle of Central London, so it might not be for everyone.  But, if you want to stay at a nice hotel that's in a quiet and safe neighborhood, you can't go wrong with the Hari."
May 2017,Stylish hotel in a great location ,"We stayed in the Hari for 3 nights. The hotel is tastefully fit out. The room is compact but very comfy. Location is great, close to a lot of Luxury shops and fine restaurants. It took us only 15 minutes' walk to Harrods and 13 minutes to the Five Fields, for fantastic fine dining. We also dined on some nice neighbourhood restaurants on King's road, which are again around 20 minutes' walk distance.  All in all, lovely stay. We will definitely stay in the Hari again when we come back to London."
March 2017,WONDERFUL STAY AT THE HARI,"From the moment we checked in to checking out, we were greeted with very experienced and helpful and courteous and warm smiles. Many thanks to evwryone at The Hari for making our stay a memorable one."
April 2017,Just Perfect!,"I've had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for six nights. During my stay, from the check-in all the way till check-out, everything about this hotel was amazing. The staff are extremely friendly and hospitable. the room was prepared and cleaned continuously (2-times a day). The location of the hotel was just the icing on the cake, as all my personal points of interest were close by and within walking distance. I'll surely stay at this hotel in the future. Superb hotel *****"
May 2017,The hari,This was my first stay at the hari. As I use to visit the hotel laounge before . The location is just 10min walk to Harrods so it's an excellent location. Quite a few steps from some nice restaurants and coffee shops . I recommend this hotel as the room was nice. Clean. Comfortable.  And the overall experience was good 
April 2017,Exquisite hotel with fantastic service,"We stayed at the Hari Hotel at the end of April to celebrate my 25th Birthday in London. Not only does the Hotel offer excellent service but also is situated very centrally near the underground stations Knightsbridge, Sloane Square and South Kensington. We had a great time and will for sure return soon."
March 2017,Back at my london home,Great to be back at The Hari such a great spot for shopping in Knightsbridge... the Italian recently opened in The Hair is a must! Not forgetting to start the day with the breakfast spoilt for choice on the English or vegetarian option both 👌
March 2017,Mr,"Would recommend. Fantastic food, and great decor. Staff very attentive. High quality feel.  Breakfast and restaurant 10/10.  Room (for the price) 8/10 Staff 10/10 Hotel quality and feel 10/10 Location 9/10 Value 9/10 ................"
March 2017,excellent boutique hotel with best service possible,"we stayed a weekend in this great hotel , we stayed in the basic room on the 9th floor , the room is excellently equipped with all you need , all in the highest quality + great view of London.  the reason to come to this hotel is the fantastic service and hospitality . Nicole and Florentine in front desc and the full team team didn't stop surprising us - wine and cookies to the room , free mobile telephone , cappuccino to the room and more and more. we have stayed in many hotels and this hotel's service level is the top. this is a perfect boutique hotel ."
March 2017,"Excellent service, good location, nice decor","The Hari is a pleasant place to stay although expensive.  But this is Knightsbridge, so you pay. The staff are really very good.  There's something about them which makes them a bit more pleasant and charming than the ordinary boutique hotel. Difficult to put my finger on exactly what it is, but if pushed I'd say it was the right balance between friendliness without being too chummy, attentiveness without being all over you, discretion without being invisible. The bar is a good place to catch up, with lots of distinct comfortable spaces.  The new restaurant is excellent too.   We stayed in the most ordinary executive room, which was nicely done, very compact, yet never feeling too small.  The bed was comfortable and the bathroom good.   I'd recommend for a couple of nights.…"
March 2017,"Cosy place, wonderful stay !!!"," Very nice place, warm and friendly welcome. Good geographical location.  Very nice room. Staff very helpful.   Possibility to have a taxi at all times in front of the hotel. We will return with great pleasure in this hotel. "
March 2017,How refreshing...,"Friendly, Friendly and Friendly.  Very, very, very attentive staff who were actually genuine - which is such an unusual experience these days. A team of individuals that were so attentive I'm still pinching myself.  it almost doesn't matter that the hotel was absolutely great too - just nice to meet people who care about ensuring you have a great stay. I cant get over what a breath of fresh air the hotel (and staff) was.  Great location, great team, great ambience."
March 2017,Great hotel for a first trip to London with a child,"My daughter and I stayed here this week for her first trip to London. The hotel was great. The staff was so accommodating and so kind to my 8 year old. Her school visit was located just down the street and the staff was wonderful about checking in our how she enjoyed her stay. The new restaurant was wonderful and also very accommodating to my family. The location was perfect for our school visit, shopping, restaurants and a quick walk to the tube station.  I will definitely be staying at the hotel again on future visits "
March 2017,Gabriela R,"It's our fourth time at The Hari and we have always had a great experience! The decor is great, super comfy beds, the food is delicious, the bar is so cozy and the service is just the best! The hotel is not big, so everyone knows you!"
March 2017,"loved it! great staff, divine room. will return for sure","The Hari is just beautiful. From the gorgeous candle scents as you arrive, to the welcome from staff, and the fabulous bikes to borrow, this is my favorite London hotel. Location is great, near to Hyde Park and just a short cycle to Harvey Nicols, Selfridges, and the Kings Road."
March 2017,Comfortable friendly 2 night stay,We stayed here for 2 nights. The staff couldn't have been more professional and friendly which included the delightful doormen. A comfortable stay in a delightfully designed hotel. Fantastic location.
April 2017,Mrs Julia,"Lovely hotel, extremely friendly stuff, professional and polite. Rooms are small, but amazing, stylish, modern, beds are comfortable. Location is good. Harrods is in walking distance.  Loved the smoking bar :) Definitely coming back! :) "
April 2017,Very Good and suprising to my children,"It eas really a nice family friendly hotel,we stayed for 4 nights, staff at the reception is very friendly,also the staff in Il Pampero.Il pampero is an ıtalian restaurant in The Hari Hotel.Dinner menü is very good and tasty, only I except more on breakfast menu, cthet serve continental buffee, it was nice but once I stayed at ""The Mayfair Hotel"" and if ı compare both, The Mayfair's breakfasts were unforgetable, however, The Hari Hotel made out day especially my daughters.She is 9 years old and every time we left the room and comeback in the evening, she always found lovely suprises.once they took her toys and took their pictures create a story and put it in an album and left on the bed with a note thats written, 'just want you to know that your boys are well looked after when…"
April 2017,Positive vibes and great atmosphere ,"Ok, this place is absolutely beautiful and great place to hang out with friends, the terrace is amazing, you can smoke upstairs in the terrace. It has good coffee and a cozy place, it is a place to visit if you are in London. Best time to go around 8PM."
April 2017,Great bar,"Amazing hotel, great terrace, great bar! Andre provides amazing service & knowledge. Very inspiring :)  Was contacting bar for arranging great lounge table for evening & Andre managed amazing space & service for us Great experience :)"
April 2017,CANT WAIT TO STAY AGAIN!,This hotel made our trip to London even more amazing!  It was my birthday weekend and they were incredibly accommodating. The staff was incredible.  The hotel was beautiful and the location is perfect.  Everything about this hotel was wonderful.  Looking forward to coming back!
April 2017,Excellent birthday,"Recently visited with my fiancée, we travelled to Birmingham and London to see the cities as part of my birthday celebrations. Absolutely excellent, on check in the staff were quick, friendly, provided us with a large supply of information and the room wasn't too far from the main lobby. Good supply of shower gels and toiletries in the room, along with tea's and coffees also. Staff had no trouble bringing fresh milk to the room as UHT isn't my thing!! We went out for dinner both nights of our stay as we dined in the hotel in Birmingham and wanted something a little different however menu looked like there was a very large selection however potentially a little pricey? Maybe just as it is London? Couldn't fault cleanliness of the room or hotel in general and overall was a lovely…"
April 2017,Great Experience,"Loved staying at the hotel. You couldn't find a more friendly and responsive staff, be it the front desk, in-room dining or housekeeping. Top of the line people. The suite was quite spacious by London standards and had all the amenities. The hotel is at a great location too!"
March 2017,Best hotel experience I've had in London in 15 years (from a frequent London visitor),"I travel to London for business nearly monthly.  I have slept in hundreds of tiny, Victorian-portioned rooms with receptionists that won't let you check in early even if the hotel is half-empty, starving for breakfast because nothing on the menu aligns with my various food allergies.  Needless to say, the Hari has changed my entire outlook on traveling to London.  The Hari benefits from the most customer-service friendly, well-trained hospitality team of professionals I've ever encountered in London.  Upon check-in, they took great delight in showing me every feature of the room including the zippy, complimentary smart phones. Then they sent up tea to calm me after my long flight.  They even left me a bottle of wine and personal notes to check in on my stay. No detail is too…"
March 2017,Brilliant ,"We spent one night in the Hari. The service was great, all of the staff were friendly and attentive. We had the continental buffet breakfast which was lovely, there was a very wide range of food. The rooms were beautiful, well furnished and the facilities were great. "
March 2017,I. Mazhar ,"Our stay at The Hari made our trip to London more enjoyable. The staff are warm, welcoming and smiling every time you walk into the lobby. The room service is excellent. Cleanliness is outstanding. It will be my preferred hotel in London. "
February 2017,Unbelievable in every way! ,"From the moment we arrived, the Hari provided first class service. Friendly helpful staff and luxurious amenities in a great location really can't be beat! The Handy phone in our room was a great touch, it provided free internet service and local calling and was indispensable while touring London. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and the rain shower was unreal! We only wish we stayed at the Hari longer.    "
February 2017,The best 5 star hotel in london,"We booked the Hari as it looked much more up top date than the fussy traditional blue curtains and gold tie backs of the historic hotels.  It's didn't disappoint, but despite being incredibly fabulously interior wise, the service surpassed all expectations. Have stayed in many hotels and the service here is the best i have experienced. Notably we were offered a choice of rooms and where possible a complimentary upgrade. Equally we experienced complimentary drinks and extremely friendly good service.  Notably the concierge was able to arrange 2 or 3 of the top london restaraunts for us. One of the was Dinner by Heston and i meet people regularly who have been struggling to get a table.  Value wise- it was min better value than the historic or big names - this helped towards…"
February 2017,Love the Staff,"The Hari is a very special place. The staff's service is very personal and they take care of you in every possible way. We book a standard room and arrived at 7am, They accommodate our early check in without a problem. Once we entered the room, my husband my a small comment 'this room is smaller than the one we got the last time we were here'....the luggage staff immediately reacted and told us he was going to make it better. 3 minutes later, front desk called and upgraded us, thank you Victor! we will now make sure be book this room, it was amazing! Pablo also was amazing, and the restaurant waiters were super nice. Food was very good, lots of healthy options. Last but not least, the concierge is also very efficient and knows all the cool places. "
February 2017,The Hari hotel is my favourite hotel,I really want to thank all the staff who are working there specially Bablo and Alin. And I want to go back again and again I really want to see the people and the hotel...for sure my next visit to London will stay in the hari.
February 2017,Amazing stay at The Hari,"Just spent a wonderful night at The Hari celebrating a friend's birthday. Situated in Leafy Belgravia is this hidden gem . Friendly staff who cannot do enough for you! Was immediately greeted from the taxi by friendly door staff who carried our bags to check in. The whole experience was amazing. My friends and I were thoroughly spoilt from the moment we arrived until checkout The hotel is beautifully decorated , luxurious and contemporary with spacious and beautiful bedrooms  We had an early pre theatre dinner in the restaurant which was delicious  The breakfast menu has a huge choice and service was brilliant  Special thanks to John, the food and beverage manager who really looked after us, as did all of the staff Will Definitely be back again soon! Carmen Lewis, Director A1…"
February 2017,Excellent service!,"Great service at arrival! Nice welcoming staff! Upgraded very nice room without any request,  good breakfast and room service for dinner.  They just should improve the bed confort which was a little hard according to me."
February 2017,London,"Excellent hotel and location. Staff was remarkable. Although in a more residential neighbourhood, in close proximity to transit and a very pleasant respite from the busier purely tourist areas of the city. Have stayed in hotels all over London- plan to stay here again."
February 2017,"Hari, Belgravia","Never ceased to be amazed by this place- the hospitality, decor, coffee and location are the best in town. I can't recommend The Hari highly enough; one of the city's gems. The photography books and artwork are also wonderful. Thank you to the kind and attentive staff who made my visit one of my favorite hotel experiences of the past few years."
February 2017,"Incredible hotel, staff and experience","I highly recommend this hotel. Wow, the staff are so friendly and the hotel is simply beautiful. The rooms are spacious and the bathroom incredible! I love the designs, the art work and the smell of the hotel as you walk through it. It is the perfect place to experience London."
January 2017,Modern luxury perfectly located and very cosy,The hotel has been recently renovated and it is of a very high and modern standard. The staff is young and friendly and thenlocarion is excellent only a 3 minute walk from the park that allows you for a morning run! Breakfast is great as well.  
May 2017,Hidden Jewel!,"The over all experience was excellent. I have stayed here in the past but it seems like it has improved under the new management. Very friendly and helpful staff, amazing rooms, excellent location , sumptuous breakfast made my short stay very enjoyable. Another big plus was the complimentary local cell phone, did not get to use much of it but seemed like a very good incentive for people on a short stay."
May 2017,Superb!,"Contemporary, sexy and offering the warmest of welcomes The Hari is a little gem of a hotel tucked away in Belgravia. The whole staff seems to believe the mantra that ""Nothing is too much trouble"" and, as a result, the service is impeccable. While you are there do try the new restaurant il Pampero, it's excellent!"
April 2017,Extra- Ordinary,"An Unbelievable Hotel that ensures you are treated like a king or queen. Great location to public transport, shops and restaurants. All Staff ensure nothing is ever to difficult and want your stay to be perfect "
April 2017,Amazing hotel,"I recently stayed at the Hari while in London partly for business and partly to run the London Marathon. The service of the hotel was fantastic, the staff were so friendly and helpful and the location is excellent. The attention to customer service detail was spectacular - they made a good luck plate of biscuits in the shape of the finish line of the marathon on the desk the day before the race and a plate of chocolate dipped strawberries in the room after the race that had ""congratulations"" written in chocolate on the plate the day after together with a note offering 2 glasses of champagne in the bar. The rooms were a little small, but for a London hotel in such a top class location its worth it. The showers were amazing and the amenities where awesome. I loved every minute…"
April 2017,Even better than expected,"We didn't have any huge expectations of The Hari. It looked nice online and we ultimately chose it because we found a good rate and it's located in a quiet but convenient area in London.   We were delighted from arrival through check out. The hotel is chic. Our room was lovely, overlooking a little park with a window seating area. Though we are familiar with London and didn't need to many concierge-type services when we did ask questions they were incredibly helpful. The location is wonderful - a primarily residential/diplomatic area so its very quiet and relaxing. But it's also super convenient - close to two major tube stops and a short walk to Sloane Square.   Overall I would highly recommend The Hari and will definitely stay there on future visits to London."
April 2017,Lovely hotel,"I stayed at the Hari this week and the best thing about this hotel is the warm and welcoming staff. I had a red eye flight and they were nice enough to accommodate an early check in. The location is the second best part which is near a few tube stations and close to a grocery store if you forget anything along the way. I learned after the fact that if you want a room with a tub in it, you should ask which I will definitely keep in mind for next time. All in all- a great place to stay."
April 2017,London at its best,"What a fantastic hotel ! Great location, great rooms and even better service. The staff were amazing from arrival to departure, it felt like we had known them for years they were so friendly. Definitely be back."
April 2017,Easter Break,"A lovely couples weekend getaway over Easter, staying in the nicest of areas in West London.  Firstly the staff couldn't be more accommodating with any requests pre arrival. The hotel, room & facilities were fantastic and couldn't fault any part of the service."
April 2017,Frienly staff and perfect location,"From the first moment we entry hotel until we leave, staff was very friendly and helpful. Hotel now is very modern and confortable. Location also the best. If you go to London, don't hesitate to try, once you do, you'll repeat. thanks to all the team"
April 2017,Very nice location,Very nice location in Belgrave Square. Staff is very friendly and smiling . Very good hospiatlity. Nice bar and restaurant. Very quick services.. It was really wonderfull to stay in The Hari. I recommend the hotel especially for business trips.
January 2017,Modern perfectly located with English tradition at the same time,I frequently use this hotel for work and leisure. My job requires me to be in London at least once a month and i have made The Hari my second home. They are very accommodating. The location is excellent - a 3 minute walk from the park to go running in the morning. It has been recently renovated - i was visiting the hotel right after the renovation with the previous name- which means that it has a lighter touch that the old english hotels. The staff is very friendly as well. It just feels modern and relaxing to be there.
January 2017,amazing service,"I was here for nearly a week and I'm not disappointed at all. Love my room view, everything was great and the staffs was super friendly and helpful. They truly will make you feel like home and always try their best to give you the best service during your stay. The only thing that I concern about is the noise. Its easy to hear noise from next door. Overall it was good and highly recommend.  "
February 2017,Great experience overall,"Cozy rooms with very comfy beds, linens, duvets and slippers! Staff is very friendly. Rooms always clean and tidy. The first floor lounge is a great place for daytime meetings and evening drinks, there is a cigar room as well."
January 2017,40th birthday in style ,"It was my third time visiting this hotel and my husband's first. We were celebrating his birthday with friends. The hotel is excellent.  The rooms are really well designed and have lovely marble bathrooms with every amenity you could need.   There is a really comfortable bar with great food. Unfortunately the restaurant was closed during this trip which was disappointing as you were limited with eating only in the bar however I am sure the new restaurant will be an excellent addition.   The location is excellent, the shops of Knightsbridge, king's road and Sloane street are just a short stroll and there are excellent restaurants within walking distance.   What will really make you want to return though is the staff. From the cleaners to the waitstaff to front desk and concierge…"
February 2017,It was certainly value for money.,"As mentioned, it was certainly value for money given location, size of the room, service of the staff (reception, lounge, doorman), lounge, smoking which belonged to the lounge. One main downside is the fact sound of people can be heard from the corridor of the floor. "
February 2017,Great experience!,"I stayed at The Hari with my mother for 3 nights before leaving London and I have to say I was not disappointed at all :)  We both had a great experience! The porters are very helpful, have to say I really appreciated as I had 4 suitcases which was not a problem at all! The front office team already knew that I really enjoy charcuterie and went beyond what was expected as we had a tasteful charcuterie board in our room! Breakfast is a Continental Buffet if it is included in your room rate! Simple but had everything I needed!   Really appreciate the handy phone in the room which is easy to use and charge, great if you do not have a British phone! The room was spacious and had everything we needed, including a tooth kit... great touch!  Thanks a lot to Charlie and Alex for the…"
January 2017,Awesome service,"Amongst the best service anywhere.  Beats most 5 star hotels. Friendly, helpful, creative, thoughtful, responsive.  Great location. Nicely designed modern rooms though as common for the area a bit small.  Very impressed "
February 2017,Perfect place in a perfect location,"The Hari hotel is a beautiful and intriguing place located in a heart of Belgravia. Walking distance from Harrods, just minutes away from the tube stations. Impeccable 24h service, 24 h room service and beautiful bar serving delicious breakfasts and small bites. Impressive cocktail list. Beautiful building, comfortable and spacious rooms, state of the art bathroom. I will never have to look for a place to stay while in London again, Hari stole my heart."
February 2017,Amazing experience ,"Me and my husband spent a long weekend at The  Hari and had the most amazing time here. This is our new favorite hotel by far. The hotel itself is very luxurious and beautifully decorated, the rooms are great with a lot thought put into the details and the beds are super comfortable. What makes this hotel really stand out though, is the genuine hospitality of the staff. Everyone from the doorman to the people at the front desk, to the bartenders and housekeepers are incredibly friendly, warm and welcoming. Best service we have ever encountered. Would highly recommend it and we can't wait to go back. "
February 2017,"The most thoughtful, generous service I've ever received","My fiance and I stayed at The Hari last night. I was surprising him for his birthday and in advance of our upcoming wedding. Jeanne at guest services was the kindest, most thoughtful host you could imagine. Not only did she upgrade our room, we arrived to find it decorated with dessert and a bottle of champagne. The next morning they remembered our story and even comped our small drinks bill from their downstairs bar. The whole staff was incredible, sweet, and personal. The room was chic, neat and quite sexy with interesting art and decor. I couldn't recommend this hotel enough for a stay in Central London."
February 2017,50 out of 10. Best of the Year,"I had the pleasure of staying at The Hari this week and it met my expectations in every way possible.  I was met with a friendly greeting by the door managers all the way through to the front desk, the warm charm of the hotel tastefully renovated complimented the genuine hospitality of the staff. I was very kindly upgraded to an executive room as i had arrived a little early but nothing was too much trouble. The staff provided helpful directions, an on time wake up call and a hot take away tea for the cab ride back to Heathrow. The bedding was first class comfort, and the view of the park and street was lovely. This is just 5 to 10 minutes walk to Buckingham Palace, Harrods and London Eye and many other attractions. This for me has been the find of the year and I will most…"
January 2017,Great Location,"We stayed at The Hari for one night as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, we have stayed at this hotel before a couple of years ago also for our anniversary and was so impressed we were looking forward to returning. The first thing to mention is that the staff here are excellent they are friendly, welcoming and eager to make your stay the best experience. Our room was very good spacious and very well kept in fact I would go as far as to say immaculate, the only thing We found strange was the lack of plugs within the room near mirrors made it a challenge to get ready in the evening for our night out. We used room service for a couple of items and they were very prompt and friendly which is always a bonus. The only reason I can not give the hotel an excellent rating was…"
January 2017,Perfect London pit stop!,"I wanted to try out the Hari because of its' excellent location and good-looking rooms. Wasn't disappointed, the staff were very friendly and welcoming and as my room wasn't ready yet when I arrived, I got upgraded to a King suite. Nice room layout, very well equipped and clean. I then received a bottle of Veuve Cliquot to make up for the very short wait. The staff at this hotel is what made the difference for me...everyone I interacted with was warm, friendly and anticipated my every need. I will definitely go back."
January 2017,An oasis of sophisticated calm in London,Beautiful sophisticated 70s decor with impeccable service.  The staff are attentive without being overbearing.  The rooms offer a cosy calm against the bustle of London.  Ask for a room facing the square.
January 2017,Best hotel I've stayed at in a very long time,"I stay in a lot of hotels around the world, and The Hari is my new favourite.  The decor is stylish, the location convenient and charming, but what sets this hotel apart is by far and away the quality of its service team.  Without exception, every interaction with the team was friendly, felt genuine and full of enthusiasm and energy.  The service was attentive without being sycophantic which is so much more pleasant.  It felt more like staying with rich friends who have a more stylish home than you, and who are just the most charming hosts that make you never want to leave.  Forget large anonymous chain hotels, stay at the Hari and relax."
January 2017,"All what you need to Know ""The Amazing Hotel""","The Hari Hotel is the right place to be in while visiting London. we went as a couple for 11 nights from 20 Feb to 3 March 2017. Starting from the online quick service and responds to the hotel lobby the reception when they welcomed us kindly and provide us cold water. we asked in advance to have the tree view and they give us what we asked for. The room size was great 30SM with a modern bathroom. They are cleaning the room twice a day. Addition to that, they are providing some cookies, brownies, fruit and other sweets as well everyday something different with 2 bottles of water all these are complimentary. They are providing when you are asking for something you are looking for to have it they will deliver it to the room in less than 2 minutes.  The most amazing thing, they…"
February 2017,One of my favourite hotels,"A beautiful, classy and friendly hotel.  Service from the second we arrived to the second we left could not have been any better. Everyone was so attentive and went above and beyond to ensure we had the best stay. Lovely to find a luxury hotel that caters for families and young children too.  The new restaurant, is also amazing!!"
March 2017,Outstanding ,"I stayed at The Hari for 1 night and the service I received there was absolutely outstanding, from the delightful welcome from all the front office team to the amazing lunch in there In house restaurant Il Pampero,to turn down service from housekeeping in the evening. I would 100% recommend this hotel to all my friends and family as I couldn't of felt more special during my stay. Thanks for an Amazing stay, I will be back for sure!   See you soon.  Aimee McCheyne "
March 2017,Impeccable! One of the best hotel in London,"We stayed for 8 nights. The hotel has a modern, artistic decor and is extremely updated and clean. Excellent location in the Belgravia district of London. The best part of this hotel is the outstanding staff. They were all very service oriented, welcoming, supportive and generally nice and friendly. Harrods and high-end shops are just a few blocks away. I'm not a smoker, but my spouse is. The hotel has a trendy outdoor terrace bar for smokers. It's located just outside of the main cocktail lounge. The terrace has smoke vents, heat and a retractable glass ceiling and a nice variety of cigars. The il Pampero restaurant located just off the lobby was very good as was room service. There are many other dining options, within walking distance."
February 2017,gem of a hotel in London,"highly recommended hotel in London excellent location clean rooms super food attentive staff great buzz in the hotel Top notch Hotel  cant fault anything  at this hotel nice size, not too many rooms either"
February 2017,A nice stay,"Conveniently located in a quiet neighborhood but only a short walk from central London, The Hari is a good choice for a short trip. The atmosphere of the hotel is nice, with some beautiful decoration details. The rooms are clean and beautiful, although a bit tight. Front desk staff is very helpful and friendly.  The service at the restaurant could use a little help, though, as they served us only half of our breakfast order (had to remind them about the rest, which came very late after we had already finished everything else). "
February 2017,Perfect Week end!,We had an excellent trip at the Hari 's Hotel. The room is very beautiful The service and the Location are perfect  We strongly recommend this hotel to everyone !!  The week end was perfect. I hope coming back quickly
February 2017,ExcellentHotel,Excellent location convenient for dining and shopping. Great rooms with excellent decorating. Exceptional hospitality and service during our stay really making us feel warmth and like home. Looking forward coming back for another stay!
February 2017,Thank you!,"I came to The Hari with my daughter and stayed there for 3 nights. The location is great, only 10 minutes from Knightsbridge and 20 minutes walk from Central London! The hotel doesn't have a lot of rooms which is perfect as the atmosphere is cosy and friendly. The continental breakfast offers a nice choice of pastries! I would really like to thank the Front Office Team for their flexibility and more specifically, Alex for the amazing welcome! Will definitely recommend and will come back! "
February 2017,Perfect!!,"location, room, service, etc. everything was perfect. great. I think I can't forget this hotel forever. I strongly recommend this hotel to everyone! How can I tell you more about this hotel! Please go there and experience yourself!"
February 2017,Perfect,"I visit London frequently, I would say The Hari is the most value for money that I ever booked. The location is just excelent 4 min from Bus Station & 9 Min from underground plus all you need is with a walking distance. The Staff are very friendly and would offer their help for anything you need. The Room is Clean l, specious and luxury."
January 2017,"Great service, great location","I stayed in this hotel right in the heart of Belgavia.  It is small and very luxurious.  The room was inventively planned and very comfortable indeed.  The staff, from the doorman, to reception, to the waiters all made you feel like they really cared.  It is in easy reach of Knightbridge and Sloane Square and a great spot for a shopping expedition but is still within easy reach of the West End."
January 2017,Amazing Hotel,I stayed at The Hari Hotel for my birthday and it was perfect from start to finish it was superb. The service we received from all staff was impeccable and we could not have asked for more.  The bar area is beautifully decorated and was a great place to enjoy pre and after dinner drinks. Our room was spacious and very tastefully designed with great views.  It is also in a great location with only a short walk to Harrods and a easy tube ride to Oxford Street/Regent Street Shops.  We cannot wait to return to The Hari hotel very soon and highly recommend it.
January 2017,Superb hotel!,"Our experience at The Hari was absolutely amazing from start to finish. It was my partners birthday and I surprised him with a weekend away to London. Prior to booking I got in touch with Alex to arrange some extras for the room and his willingness to help and make this occasion special was really something else. We had complimentary champagne, balloons and cake in the room which my partner loved and The Hari even upgraded our room to a suite which was incredible. Bath with views overlooking the park, comfortable bed, gorgeous amenities. The Hari simply have everything you could possibly need for a 5* stay.  If you're considering staying at The Hari, do not even hesitate. It's an amazing hotel with detail to everything imaginable. Expect a warm personable greeting on arrival and…"
January 2017,ALWAYS AN AMAZING STAY,"amazing hotel, at the best location.  great staff  ROOM ARE SPACIOUS, CHIC... MARBLE, GREAT DECO AND designed deco pièces  the entrance of the hotel is so confortable, and welcoming  breakfast always a best"
April 2017,Sublime stylish and on trend ,The young and good looking staff have perfected the balance of being engaging but not being in your space. The foyer/ bar is relaxing but can be busy in the evenings. The rooms are stylish but small for price. Very conveyfor Knightsbridge and Sloane street. Restaurant is excellent Italian and good service. 
March 2017,A fantastic stay in Belgravia,"We enjoyed a lovely weekend of business and pleasure in Belgravia at The Hari. The location is beautiful, the property is stylish, the staff is charming and attentive and the accommodations are welcoming, luxurious and clean."
March 2017,"Excellent hotel with nice rooms, great location and fantastic staff",I traveled with my 12 year old son. We both felt so welcome and the staff helped us with our questions and requests. Their care and service put a silver lining on our stay.  I highly recommend a stay at The Hari!
March 2017,"Beautiful, 5 Star stay, central location","The Hari is nothing short of 5 star, from the moment you arrive and greeted by the doormen, check in, and the rooms, everything was beyond expectations! These days it is hard to come by, this is why I stay at boutique hotels. We stayed here twice during our visit to London, both times for 5 nights, at the start and the end of our trip. Once on the 5th floor, then on the 8th. Both rooms fantastic, views on the 8th floor provided view of the London Eye and skyline.   Room: We upgraded to a Twin Premium room, fantastic size room with 2 extra large single beds, couch in window, mini bar, TV etc... with great size bathroom. The use of space was very welcoming, lots of mirrors as well. The room was lovely, fresh, clean, lots of light, large windows and wooden floors. Bed was very…"
March 2017,"Elegant, Cozy and Friendly","Love this hotel! Centrally located, wonderful, smart, interesting and interested staff, cozy room and super fast and kind room service (Thank you, Sabrine, you are the best! Promote her, guys!) plus great food in the restaurant, awesome concierge. I come to London lots, this is my second time at The Hari and I will be back next year. Thanks for a great trip, everyone!"
March 2017,Italian luxury in London,I cannot recommend The Hari London enough. From the complimentary glass of wine when I arrived to the room upgrade when I told them I was a sleep deprived Mama in search of respite and the general friendliness and warmth expressed by every single member of staff I came into contact with. The oxtail ravioli at the Hotel's Il Pampero restaurant were beautiful and the vege full English breakfast was fantastically filling. Bathtub is definitely big enough for two..my little legs couldn't reach the end so I was mostly trying not to drown 😁 But the marble luxury of the bathroom and Noble Isle products more than made the effort to stay afloat worthwhile!  Room was very clean and comfortable too. Free WiFi did disconnect quite a few times but was generally good.  Guest Relations…
March 2017,Excellence,"Have stayed at many wonderful hotels around the world, The Mercer in NYC, The Mandarin Oriental in London, Aman resorts etc, and this one is exceptional. Not just the hotel and its facilities, great rooms, excellent hotel restaurant and bar - but especially the staff. Every day of my 10 day stay staff were very kind and very cheery to deal with, and terrifically attentive."
March 2017,"Great hotel, friendly staff","Enjoyed our stay at the Hari. The staff were exceptionally good, couldn't do enough for you and made the stay feel personal. Great location, comfortable rooms. The only negative is that bar menu is expensive even for London prices. "
March 2017,my new favorite hotel in London,"a really great place to stay in one of Londons best areas and also more tranquil than being in the West End of London. Close to  Londons best shops, including Harrods and a wonderful selection of  restaurants to choose from or be advised by the very knowledgeable hotel staff."
March 2017,Exceptional,"I dont usually write reviews but i felt compelled to in this case, I treated my parents to a anniversary weekend and i booked the Hari based on the many positive reviews i had read. The whole experience and attention to detail and service is indeed exceptional, i have been lucky to stay in many 5* hotels but in the UK, the Hari surpasses them all, the informality combined with first class service from every member of staff is a credit to the hotel and reflects in the investment in the people who work there and nurtures a very relaxed, enjoyable experience for the residents. We were checked in by Renata, who symbolises the attention to detail and makes it all look effortless, she is engaging and friendly, once she discovered it was my parents birthday/anniversary weekend, she…"
February 2017,A wonderful stay,I enjoyed my stay at your hotel and will recommedn all my friends to book your hotel when they visit London. You made my stay memorable. Everything from staff to rooms to service was extremely wonderful.  Thanks! :) 
January 2017,the little hotel that could,"The Hari  hotel is in one of the nicest areas of London. The hotel staff and service is excellent and they give  this 4 star hotel a 5 star feel. The rooms are modern and well appointed, but are on the small side. What the hotel lacks in room size and charm, they more then make up for  with their   fantastic staff and the little extras that they offer. I look forward to my next stay at The Hari."
February 2017,Cool Central London Hotel,"I've stayed at The Hari a couple of times recently and have been very impressed by the staff and hotel. The rooms are well appointed with good size seating areas, a decent TV and fantastic bathroom, both times with a great shower.  The location is ideal, close to Victoria and Knightsbridge tubes stations, about 10 minutes from each.  The staff were very professional, but friendly at the same time, it's a nice touch that they accompany you to your room after check in.  Overall a great place to stay and I'll definitely be staying again."
January 2017,Super friendly staff,My son and I spent 3 nights in the Hari and were welcomed in a pleasant way and very personal. Staff gave us good suggestions where to go and were to eat. The second day we returned to the hotel the end of the day and found nice pastry in the room modeled after the tower ( the Shard) we visited that day. Especially thanks to Anita and Alin our stay was very memorable.
February 2017,Above expectation,"Our stay was above expectation, well located, two good metro options, super attentive staff, suprise at Valentin's Day with our room decorated with rose petals, we would definitely return to The Hari."
August 2016,"Comfortable, beautiful and friendly","I have been to this hotel a few times and find it to be a home away from home. It is relaxed and has a beautiful interior.  The staff are so friendly, welcoming and accommodating it is a joy to visit. I love that we were given small bottles of water on arrival and every time we left the hotel.  The restaurant is also very nice and relaxed and you do not feel like you are eating in a hotel.  Looking forward to a return visit!"
February 2017,Exceptionally Amazing staff,"Perfect location, the most amazing staff always making you feel welcomed. Friendly atmosphere, making sure they assist you with anything possible. Rooms are nice, overall perfect place to stay business or pleasure trip. Bar/ terrace is located on 1st floor a place to unwind the day or evenings."
February 2017,"Excellent, comfortable stay","As soon as we walked into the Hari we felt welcome and comfortable. We were greeted by friendly staff who were helpful and smiling. After eating a delightful sweet from the front desk, we were guided to our room and left to relax in contentment and modest luxury. A great night sleep and superb service from the Hari staff through until we left. "
February 2017,Lovely hotel but bar is smoke ridden,A great experience overall. Friendly staff. Beautifully decorated. 5* experience. But the lobby and bar area just reeks of cigar smoke. There is a smoking terrace above the bar but on a Saturday night - the smoke and smell is just overwhelming if you're a non-smoker. 
January 2017,"Great value, extremely friendly & clean rooms","One of my best hotel experiences in my life and I have traveled a lot.. I don't think you will ever come by a friendlier and more genuine set of staff. Great team! We got upgraded to a bigger room on arrival, the design was great, rooms were clean and the location was perfect either as a newcomer to London or a more experienced visitor!"
December 2016,Great stay which was not planned,"We were very lucky to find the room at The Hari which made our stay very comfortable as our prior hotel overbooked their rooms and we needed to find another room at short notice. The Hary has great rooms and very friendly staff. We had breakfast at the restaurant, but it took almost 40min until food was served. This is clearly too long for a simple breakfast."
December 2016,Lovely stay at The Hari in London,"Fabulous service, friendly atmosphere, unbeatable location. Rooms are small but very comfortable; great views from ours. Probably better for a business or couple trip than for families, but the staff made us all feel at home. Very good choice if you are looking for a boutique hotel in one of London's best areas. We had a lovely stay!"
December 2016,Too short a stay,"Had only one night here but felt great from moment large door swung open to reveal genuine welcome, uncliched style and cocoon like atmosphere. It's bang in the centre of centres - Harrods is a few streets over, plenty of life nearby but this is lovely quietl area so good nights sleep in spacious room with decent bed and heavenly sheets. All the details like ironing boards and handy sockets there. Tasty breakfast with a bit of imagination and great coffees. And the staff? Nothing short of brilliant. Only complaint - lighting slightly too low so couldn't find things in suitcase, so really not a complaint. Go have fun and stay longer than we did. "
November 2016,My last visit to London ,"It was the first time for me in the Hari hotel as every time I go to London I book in the JW , I will never forget this trip!! It's amazing, the location of the hotel is perfect and the price for 2 weeks is good, the staff is very friendly and helpful the room serves is wander full and fast, I try the food as well and it's delicious! Simply this is the warmest trip ever . If you looking for luxury & cozy place just choose that one."
December 2016,Nice hotel but far from city center with children,"The room is very nice, modern and so quiet. The hotel offers a handyphone for net, maps and international calls for free for some countries. Unfortunately, Portugal isn't included but it was very helpful for itineraries in the city, internet, etc I have been in London with my daughters ( 8 and 11years old) and I think the hotel could be more close to the city center . The distance between the hotel and the nearest tube station is about 15 min walking . For me it was easy but for the girls, in the end of the long day , it was very hard. The hotel is in residential zone, therefore, there aren't a lot of restaurants, supermarkets, coffee shops,"
November 2016,Great hotel in the middle of beautiful Belgravia area,"First visit to the Hari in the middle of beautiful Belgravia was a nice experience - great hotel, nice & clean rooms as well as bathrooms, friendly service was a very positive surprise as I had not heard of the hotel before. The Hari is also within 5-10 minutes walking distance from both Knightsbridge and Sloane Squae, so good shopping areas and  tube stations nearby"
November 2016,Beyond amazing–6 star hotel! Staying here was incredible.,"This is the kind of hotel you want to keep an absolute secret because it's so wonderful.  We have stayed at some of the nicest hotels around the world and never before had an experience like we did at The Hari. At every step, it was above and beyond.  We're really picky when we stay at hotels (about hygiene, decor, and quiet.) The Hari beyond exceeded our expectations and hopes.   Their rooms are STUNNING with impeccable views, they give you a complimentary smart phone during your stay for traveling around the city, their breakfast and restaurant is divine–I could go on and on. Clean, beautiful, chic, tasteful, quiet, perfect location. What more could you ask for?  The staff was so lovely, we were literally sad to say goodbye to them. They were the most responsive, warm, and…"
November 2016,Lovely Hotel for Events,"We held a private event here on the terrace, followed by dinner in the private dining room and drinks in the snug. Perfect for small events of 10-20 people. Great location and decor. This would also be a lovely hotel for anyone wanting to stay in London for the weekend."
November 2016,"Fine hotel, very good location","I travel very often to London and I always choose to stay at ""The Hari"", because of the very good location, the fine atmosphere, the artistic design and decoration, the impeccable cleanliness, the courtesy,  willingness and flexibility of the highly trained staff (to mention especially Anita and Alex - Deputy managers, Nabil - Bar Manager, Sammy - Bar tender, the doormen, all are fantastic!). I highly recommend ""The Hari"" to everyone who would like a stylish and comfortable stay in London."
November 2016,"A well located hotel , almost near everything",excellent hotel . must visit. extremely welcoming and the heated outside garden /bar is wonderful . i suggest it is a must visit hotel. it is near the shopping boutiques and the famous Harold. walk away from Sloane street and kings road  
November 2016,Amazing stay at the Hari !,"The hotel was so central and great for a nignt stay with the children and our stop at winter wonderland, the staff were friendly and helpful and we felt immediately relaxed that it was family friendly. The room was spacious and clean and they went to the effort of bringing treats for the children which they loved . Would definitely recommend the Hari for a great stay in central London!  Thank you we felt very looked after and had a great time!"
November 2016,Loved this place,The concierge service at the Hari went above and beyond-from helping out with lost packages to loaning their personal Oyster card.  The chocolates and bottle of wine in the room didn't hurt either! Don't miss their cocktail lounge upstairs-uber chic!
November 2016,"Dedicated to chiara, Cristian ","I love them so much , They are the best And best service provided here  ❤️❤️❤️they should be promoted  Ps. Chiara is pretty damn cute She has the best heart  They are just the best ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Words can't describe how amazing this place is  "
November 2016,FM,"i really enjoyed for this hotel its great location near from harrods , the stay what i selected its for two persons only the capacity for room no too much large but overall its nice for stay here.   also if i come back again London i will stay again in this hotel."
November 2016,Excellent Hotel,Just spent a lovely couple of days at 'The Hari'.  It is an amazing hotel in a great location easy walk to the tube and there was always a cab available outside. There are also some really funky bicycles for the guests to use.  Breakfast was really nice I had a great omelette.  There is a lovely bar always very busy with a great vibrant atmosphere.  The bar staff are really friendly especially Luis. I will definitely return the next time I am up in London. If you do you won't be disappointed. 
November 2016,Lovely Boutique Hotel in a great location,Sadly stayed only one night at this cool hotel. Location is good; within walking distance of Harrods and Natural History Museum.  The rooms are well equipped and bed very comfortable.  The staff were all warm and welcoming and very helpful. We would have no hesitation choosing this hotel again.
November 2016,Excellent Experience,"Great location, warm friendly boutique hotel. Nice room, terrific location. The staff is what sets this hotel apart. From the moment we arrived we felt welcome and everyone made sure we were happy.  The concierge Diego responded to each of our requests with the perfect solution. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
November 2016,A great place to stay in London,"Excellent location and friendly, knowledgeable staff, the customer care is superb, down to even the doorman knowing who I was and that my daughter would be joining me later as it was her birthday! Such great attention to detail."
November 2016,Gorgeous boutique hotel,"Nice booking experience by phone...they honored the Trip advisor price, despite being unlikely to have that grade of room available on the evening. I was given an upgrade on arrival to a suite on the 10th floor. (1004).  The room was beautiful. Extremely clean and modern. Nice sofa area with real flame fireplace and bar area. Bathroom was marble with both a bath tub and rain shower. Lovely chain metal curtain to separate the bedroom from the bathroom...very chic. Great view of London skyline including the Shard, Gherkin and St Paul's.  As it was my husband's birthday they kindly left a chilled bottle of champers and a cake for him. Very much appreciated.  The corridors are dark and decked out with great interior design. It's a great place for a romantic hideaway. The bar is nice…"
November 2016,Family stayover,"We stayed at The Hari as a treat to my wife and boys at beginning of November. We booked the family suite with adjoining rooms and we bowled over by the quality of everything to do with the Hotel. The room was fabulous and luxurious in detail and furnishings with the added bonus of great views over London. Joanna from guest relations really took care of us from arrival and even laid on some great little touches for my boys inc popcorn and decorative doughnuts, and a bottle of champers for me and wife. We had our evening meal in main restaurant which again was excellent even catering for the children with their own menu. Breakfast was pretty special as well and overall we were taken care of by all the staff and will definitely be coming back."
November 2016,Top notch hotel,Third visit to this hotel tried 3 room sizes and we are impressed with all . Location is fantastic near to Knightsbridge and kings rd. restaurant and b ars reasonably priced and breakfast very good quality and good value. The main positive has to be customer service and staff from doorman to waitress and even the evening turn down service maid staff smile acknowledge you at all points of contact. So impressed we will stay here in preference every time.
November 2016,Amazing hotel and friendly staff,"I booked two rooms from Nov 4th - Nov 12th . I really enjoyed my stay , the staff were really helpful especially Ali and Semo. The Hari has perfect location 5 min walking to Harrods, and 12 min to oxford by the bus (bus #137) . Definitely i will stay at the hari in my next visit to london."
November 2016,Serendipity at The Hari,"Every once in a long while an unpleasant experience turns into a fantastic one. So was my experience at The Hari, a fine luxury establishment in terms of rooms, food and location. It's the staff, however, that makes the difference between a good stay and a great one. In this regard, the staff at The Hari is exceptional and in my case they managed to change my opinion from utter disappointment (due to what is probably a rare mishap) to complete satisfaction. Special thanks to Ms. Chettiar for going beyond the call of duty to ensure a very pleasant stay at the hotel; her emotional intelligence score is off the charts! Thank you to The Hari London team. I already look forward to my next visit."
November 2016,Super place to stay in London!,"The Hari is a really nice hotel in the heart of London. Location is perfect to visit the inner city. The service is of high quality, the employees are full of attentions to make you have a great experience. I would definitely come back :)"
November 2016,Full marks to a wonderful staff,Hotel is very central and suited our needs.  The staff were extremely friendly and no request  seemed to be a burden. I felt there was team effort in the hotel and all pulled together to make our experience a most enjoyable one.
November 2016,Our trip to london,Nice hotel nice room employees very kind  good location in one of the best  place of London I recommend  this hotel to everybody the breakfast was so accurate with a large choice of  sweets when l come to London  in the next future I retur to your hotel  kind regards Marinella Mattia is very friendly person 
November 2016,Comment ,"Simply perfect in all aspects of service , wide and clean room, complete breakfast. Position very Convenient for the main attractions of the town . Staff cheerful and accurate. Special thanks to Mattia for his attention ."
November 2016,"Fantastic boutique-ish hotel, in a fantastic location","I took my wife and daughter here for a weekend pre-ceding my work in London and it was fantastic. the staff, food, rooms....all just really really good and to be honest: that's hard to find nowadays! The best thing was that we paid a very reasonable price for London hotels! I had the best birthday weekend and a great stay for work as well!"
November 2016,Another Return Joy,"This is our third visit in as many years and it never fails to amaze.  The front staff are so cheerful, helpful but more importantly remember you by name, which in these days of hustle and bustle is a true gem....especially Ricardo, thank you. Ben the head concierge was just a superstar, you know what you did for us, thank you very much it was a mark of a true professional. May we thank Angie and the reception team for organising the ""Lion King"" slate in our room made of a wonderful looking brownie with the Lion King logo on top, unfortunately unable to eat as I am diabetic and my husband doesn't do cake but it was truly appreciated. All the staff whether breakfast,  (which is fabulous and fresh), housekeeping or reception are very pleasant, always say hello and again you don't…"
November 2016,Beautiful Accommodations and Top Notch Customer service,"Recently went on a group trip to London with a few friends, had originally booked another hotel but switched over to the Hari and we are glad we did.  Location is walking distance from a lot of major attractions (Harrods, Buckingham Palace, etc) but in a great location to walk to cute shops and restaurants but not have to deal with the traffic that deals with the hustle and bustle of being on a main road.  Checked in and was given an upgraded room, that always sets a nice pace but all the staff went out of their way to make my stay comfortable.  Simo, was especially wonderful as he greeted me by name every time I came in the door and while I wait for my friends would offer us something to drink (a real nice touch).  Rooms in London tend to be smaller than the US but even at what…"
December 2016,Swedtraveller,"Nice location near Belgravia, Close to Chealse and Sloane street with cosy shops and rest. Like to come back in spring and be able to enjoy the parks nearby. Hotel is nice not to big with great service and Always there for you if needed. Nice bar area with good drinks."
January 2017,Excellent hotel in belgravia,"Great little hotel with absolutely outstanding service. I was made to feel very comfortable from the minute I arrived until the minute I left. the staff are polite and accomodating, service is fast, food is great and the room was cozy and very clean. I highly recommend it."
November 2016,Fabulous service & great location &beautiful property,"The hotel is located in the heart of Belgravia, a quiet, filled with embassies area and it is a gem of a property, fully refurbished , with great design accents  and beautifully appointed rooms , decorated in calming colors, and flaunting superb materials. The rooms are on the small side, but it's understandable considering the type of building that hosts this hotel, and that minus is compensated by great amenities and an amazing location. Yet, the uniqueness of this property is given by its staff and service: welcoming, friendly, warm, professional, always with a smile and ready to offer their help, or a good advice. Our stay was one of our best hotel experiences , and we can't wait to go back. The bellman staff - ( Matias and Florin especially) - are the accolades that embrace…"
January 2017,Wonderful stay,"We had a lovely 1 night stay. The staff from the moment we walked in to the moment we left were wonderful. Room service breakfast was good, the bar on the first floor relaxing and the hotel is in a fantastic location. I would recommend this hotel and will stay again in the future"
December 2016,Superb!!! ,"Our staying in The Hari, was an excellent choice for our short vacation in London. Sloane Square metro station was a 10min walk and from there you could go everywhere in London. Belgravia is one of the nicest places in London, friendly, very quiet and we enjoyed walking through it. Outside the hotel there was always a cab, for those who didn't want to walk to the metro station. The room was spacious and modern decorated. The bed was so comfortable, that you didn't want to get out of it.  They provided us with a mobile phone,  where the city map was loaded and various tourist friendly applications. You could also use it for calling,  but unfortunately Greek numbers were not included. The staff was great,  very polite and kind.  Continental breakfast was included,  which was very…"
December 2016,Christmas Holiday," SUFFERING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A GOOD HOTEL AND AN EXCLUSIVE HOTEL As the end point of our Christmas holiday was one of the London airport, we decided to spend our last night at THE HARÍA-London Belgravia Hotel. Again, great decision. As an architect with many years of hotel construction experience, I never had the opportunity to take on the responsibility of building a Boutique Hotel. THE HARI is a great example to analyze and enjoy the difference between a good hotel and an exclusive hotel. I recommend those interested in sharing this concept to tray it. We coincidentally coincided at the time of check-in with the prestigious Spanish journalist ""Mr. Iñaki Gabilondo"" and it was a pleasure and a pride, to see the education, kindness and effectiveness with which was treated for…"
December 2016,Best experience amazing staff,"We arrived exactly at noon with our room waiting for us . Started organizing to leave to tour the city when we discovered an undetectable (by any standard) problem in the room (left under the bed by the previous tenants). The hotel staff was so friendly and apologetic, we where shortly upgraded to a junior suite until the end of our stay 5 days later. I would like to thank Anita and all staff members for an amazing stay, starting from the comfortable bed clean room great breakfast and amazingly over the top courtesy and willingness to help by everyone at the hotel.  Thank you for making this a memorable experience."
December 2016,Great Experience,"Although I have been a regular at this hotel over time, this is the first time I stayed when under owner-management. I am pleased to say that standards are as high as ever. Great location, great rooms & good food/drinks options. The stand-out though is the staff. A number of familiar faces. Always pleasant, always helpful. Expensive, but good things don't come cheap. Highly recommended."
December 2016,Stunning hotel with exemplary service,"We enjoyed a superb stay at the Hari.  The attention to detail and exemplary service standards were beautifully bundled up in a classy, modern and chic environment.  We particularly enjoyed sipping some amazing cocktails in the relaxed yet classy bar area.  The room offered a nice aspect and was meticulously clean.  All in all, a great hotel tucked away in a fantastic part of the City.  Thank you, see you soon."
December 2016,Service with smile - The Hari Hotel ,"Back in England after more than 10 years... I picked the hotel based on the reviews. We arrived early at 10.30am on the 23 Dec 2016. Dead tired after 18 hours flight. The weather was cold and by the time we reached the hotel we are just exhausted.   The girl at the reception was really cheerful and welcoming, I wished I remembered her name, all I remembered she planned to visit Asia in Jan 2017. She was helpful and tried to arrange for early checked in. She even offered us coffee tea while waiting for the room. Jack the concierge ever ready to serve us with the luggage, and within 10 mins we got our room. It was really a good start...  The place is cosy and artful. I bet every little things placed were done carefully. The room is not that big but it was cozy enough for us. All I…"
December 2016,Another great stay!,"The Hari is a fantastic place to stay. Great location (my fav in London, quiet, leafy and near Knightsbridge) with beautiful rooms. Stayed in both a suite and a deluxe room over the course of a couple of weeks in Dec, and have to recommend the suite. Impeccably furnished and surprisingly spacious for a hotel in London.   Have stayed here previously a couple of times, and every trip has been consistently great. Friendly, warm staff all made me and my sisters feel comfortable and welcome throughout the stay. Will definitely be back!! :)"
December 2016,Best Birthday!!!,I have staied in this beautifull hotel in order to celebrate my 30s Birthday. As soon as you enter the main Door you feel welcome as you would enter into  your House. Staff very attentive and a special thanks to  Ricardo and Daniel for taking care of my luggage and the guys at the restautant for attending me during my dinner.  Good size room facing the front with outstanding View. I will be back for my 31. 
December 2016,"Hands down, the best hotel experience","From the moment I called and booked a room with Alex everything was perfect. When we checked in we were were offered a drink, homemade chocolates and biscuits before being escorted to our room and having all the facilities explained. The room was lovely with two large beds and comfy sofa in the bay window overlooking the greenery of Chesham Place, this was perfect for sipping the champagne they had left in our room for my daughter's 18th birthday. Later we also had a cake delivered which all went above and beyond expectation...my daughter felt incredibly special! The room had everything we needed including an android phone with free London calls and apps to help you plan your London visit, good hairdryer, robes, good toiletries and well stocked minibar. We had a shower rather…"
December 2016,Birthday treat,"A very pleasant experience, staff very attentive.the room was not too spacious but fine for a weekend stay,housekeeping had a slight hiccup but this was soon remedied. all staff were extremely helpful."
December 2016,The BEST hotel,"I love this hotel. The staff, rooms and location is all perfect. This is my fourth time staying in the hotel. The area is also fab with Harrods within a 5 min walk and all lovely shops around it. The staff are lovely and really welcoming when you arrive. "
December 2016,Great experience!,"First time in this lovely hotel and I will definitely come back soon! The staff were wonderful, always greeting and very helpful. We received a plate with chocolate cakes and written happy birthday for our daughter, such a kind attention! The interior design is lovely, every little detail is taken in consideration. I loved the Serge Mouille lamps and the chairs. Rooms were clean, practical and beautiful and the bed great.Turndown service excellent and every night other sweets and water each side of the bed. Breakfast delicious in a cosy atmosphere. I felt right away at home in this hotel! "
December 2016,Very cool and cozy atmosphere,"We went for a romantic week-end to London for my husbands birthday. The hotel has a very nice location, contemporary rooms, a good bed, a nice bar and very nice staff that provided us with everything we needed."
December 2016,Weekend in London,"This was our first stay at the Hari and it was amazing. The staff were fantastic and we were made to feel very special....we were greeted by name when we walked through reception. That is exceptional! The room was lovely and had a great view as we were on the eighth floor. It was well furnished and very clean. As you might expect, the turndown service was a nice touch and the little bag of chocolates was lovely. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who enjoys a touch of luxury."
December 2016,"Amazing stay, beautiful hotel and location and amazing staff","I visited the Hari a couple of weeks ago with my boyfriend and we were both very impressed with the hotel and couldn't fault one thing. The staff were very helpful and friendly (the couldn't do enough for you), the room was clean and spacious and the location was perfect. We also dined at the Pont Street restaurant in the hotel and again 5* service.  Would highly recommend this luxurious boutique hotel."
December 2016,Top welcome seriously looked after.,Seriously dog friendly. Gave 2 of us plus dog a magical birthday stay.Car and luggage  so looked after by Mattia.Violetta would walk and spoil my dog rotten as well as seeing to our every need.Elena gave as a really exciting varied breakfast so different.Simona and Mario would  even take my dog out at midnight. The most comfortable bed in a long time.So many extras sorted on the spot  and nothing too much trouble  
October 2016,Perfect stay ,"An excellent hotel. The staff could not do enough for us and were attentive and helpful. The continental breakfast was lovely, and everywhere spotless. It was my wife's birthday, and the staff picked up on this and left a cake, a card and a bottle of champagne in the room. Cocktails in the bar were great. It's only a short walk from two tube stations, and close to lots of London landmarks. Overall, a fantastic weekend. "
October 2016,Excellent service and stay!!,I love staying at the Hari Hotel when I come to London on business which is about 6-8 times a year. They have been so welcoming and friendly each time. The service is amazing. The rooms are modern and chic. Very comfortable. Gym on site for exercise. The restaurant downstairs is also excellent - I've had breakfast and dinner and always loved my meal. Staff is friendly and accommodating. Couldn't recommend it more! 
October 2016,The Hari - Amazing stay,"I stayed here twice in the space of 10 days and the team, the service and the location have not let me down.  I wish I had longer time to spend in the hotel and enjoy all the amenities. The fact that hey give you a complimentary device for calls and data roaming whilst you are here is the icing on the cake From check in to getting a cab and organizing my schedule - the team at the Hari were helpful and on hand. You have to remember the name of the hotel f wha tit was before being called the Hari as some taxi drivers do not know it - but they always get you to Chesham Place and the restaurant is usefully called Pont Street - so you can always find it."
September 2016,Excellent Choice,"Outstanding location, quality hotel, and gracious accommodating service.  Would recommend without reservations.  Short walking distance to Buckingham Palace, historic sites, Harrods and shopping.  Restaurants in area excellent."
October 2016,Wow,"We stayed for our anniversary as part of a weekend of treats and were truly bowled over by the standard of service and friendliness of staff, a bottle of champagne on ice and other treats were placed in our room to help with the celebrations. Fantastic!"
September 2016,IMPROVING EXCELLENCE,"Last week, I returned to Hotel Belgrave Thompson after his name change as THE HARI. Upon entering the hotel, I saw the intention of the owners to enhance their facilities as ""Boutique Hotel"" and though apparently +/- as usual, improve excellence is a very complicated task because the hotel is great, its suitable to their level facilities and the relationship have good value. I want to tell you that, I see very favorably impressed by the performance of a Spanish receptionist, I think called Victor, solving a problem about customers of their nationality during the night shift. His education, patience and kindness show that the hotel management has been very careful in the selection of staff. In summary, great location between Knightsbridge-Sloane Square-Buckingham Palace, great…"
September 2016,Great weekend at the Hari,Hari is in the perfect spot for the high end shopping and dining of Knightsbridge and Chelsea..rooms are luxurious and very comfortable.  Staff very attentive and food was excellent! Definitely be back 
September 2016,Very good lunch,"Went in after being rained on so it was unplanned. Very slick cafe with a modern feel and good service. Sliders were really good, chips were someone of the best that I have had on London. The nutella filled donut balls were heavenly! Loved this place alot."
September 2016,overnight,"The Hotel has an excellent location, very close to Knightsbridge. easy access with public transportation and private vehicle. Continental breakfast is very complete and very friendly staff, rooms are cozy and very comfortable bed"
September 2016,Stay at The Hari,"Unpleaseant stay, during the stay ac was not wroking and the room was very hot during the night. requested the management to send someone to fix it, engineer was sent after the first request then no other actions where taken to resolve the issue. "
January 2017,The jewel of london hotels,The hotel is small and rooms aren't the biggest but the hotel staff are excellent extremely helpful and constantly went over and beyond at this stay. The rooms have a superb finish and the in room dining is second to none. We can't wait to come and stay again - Alex the manager is an absolute delight he made our stay unforgettable - thank you 
January 2017,Wonderful Hotel!!,"Delightful boutique hotel, with the most attentive / friendly staff. Great location as its in walking distance of the Natural History Museum and Harrods. Excellent facilities, this is easily one the best hotels I have stayed in for some time !"
January 2017,My 40th at The Hari,"The hotel is fabulous. They made my 40th Birthday so special. Staff are incredible, hotel decor is gorgeous, food & drinks are lovely and rooms super cosy. I can't say or recommend this hotel enough. I will be back for sure. Well done The Hari x"
January 2017,A little gem between Chelsea and Kensington,"A boutique hotel ideally situated in the astonishingly quiet but by no means subdued surroundings of Belgravia, the Hari offers a fabulous harbour to a large variety of guests, notwithstanding their various idiosyncrasies and depths of boredom.  "
January 2017,Jewel in Belgravia,"A luxuriously appointed bijoux hotel in great location.  Best service I have encountered in many years - friendly, helpful and personalised. Rooms were small but perfectly formed. Little touches like no wifi password and ""handy phone"" (Free mobile phone for use during stay) were appreciated."
December 2016,2 night stay all the way from Cape Town,"We were blown away with the exquisite modern hotel and our room was a large, comfortable room with stunning views of Belgravia. The staff were super friendly and the added bonus of the Hotel Bicycles was a great way to see Hyde Park."
January 2017,Luxurious Hotel,"Fantastic location, a short walk from Sloane Square station.  Welcomed by friendly staff and the room was immaculate.  The small things made it for me; robes, slippers, fruit, wine and needless to say the bed was extremely comfortable!  The shower was an absolute dream and the toiletries smelt divine.  The room was tidied whilst I was out for dinner, a bottle of water & small bag of nougat was a lovely surprise when I got back.  There was a mobile phone next to the bed which enabled me to surf the net for free which I thought was a great touch.  I will definitely be returning as it was the perfect place to stay after being out in Mayfair and checking out at midday was ideal as I didn't need to rush."
January 2017,Beautiful Hotel - great location superb staff,"The Hari a beautiful modern design hotel in the best location. But what really makes it outstanding is its superb staff. Nothing was too much trouble and we were looked after so well. It was my wife's birthday and there was champagne and brownies. We had a lovely time in the cocktail bar with friends. We've stayed in many of the top hotels in London, but from now on when we come to London: We'll be at the Hari."
January 2017,"Great Hotel, fun and different","The Hari is a top quality hotel is a great high-end area of the city.  Although the rooms are fantastic, interesting and luxurious, the real highlight is the employees.  All that I encountered were friendly and helpful in a professional appropriate way. It was impressive!"
January 2017,Wonderful place to stay,I stayed there few days ago for night room was beautiful.staff were great from I walked in and out.i would recommend if your round the area good value for money..breakfast was ok I wasn't very kin of breakfast..
November 2016,Anniversary treat made extra special at The Hari,"Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Hari. It was our wedding anniversary and the hotel went to, what we thought, was great lengths to make our stay one to remember. Check in was perfect, room ready, Joanna knew it was our anniversary and offered us complementary drinks (very tasty margarita). The room was spotless, modern, everything we needed. 1st night we received champagne and choccies, delicious. The small gym looked very new and modern and you entered using your room key so early starts were not a problem. Room service was efficient and all food was great, usual hotel prices. The location of the Hotel was perfect for us, short walk to Sloane St, Buckingham Palace, Harrods!  All in all we had a great time, the Hari staff were all lovely, friendly and very helpful. We…"
November 2016,A stay at this gem of a hotel is a must,"My partner and I have just returned from the most wonderful stay at The Hari and what a treat it was. From start to finish the experience was superb. Incredibly attentive staff, stylish rooms and a luxurious bar. The balance is just right - discrete, stylish but not pretentious. Our room (on the 9th Floor) gave us the most spectacular views over London and with the sun setting we were able to see London like we never have before. All this without even having to leave the room! The location is superb and I love all the little extra special touches and attention to detail. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel, A class. "
November 2016,"Beautiful, hip and perfectly located! ",They really take care of you here! Such a beautiful hotel and has everything you need! Most comfortable room and sleep. Simo worked at the door and was so sweet and helpful for us as well as the other staff! 
November 2016,Magic,Rooms are clean and very modern. This boutique hotel in the heart of London is offering the best service. Thank you especially to Simona for her tremendous efforts in making this stay unforgettable. See you soon!
November 2016,Great!,"The hotel is fabulous; the staff including Simo and Alex are amazing! Everyone was fantastic, the hotel restaurant is superb, and the rooms are very chic. Excellent all around. The concierge staff was very helpful organizing our days and helping us buy tickets in advance so we did not have to wait in long lines. Great location close to great restaurants and the tube. Many thanks to the staff for making our stay fantastic! "
November 2016,"Great location, good service, thin walls","All was gust great except for some noises that come from corridor (for example from someone closing a door) - if you sleep sensitively - consider this and ask for a room with less guests. Regarding staff - all super friendly, especially Simo working on the doors."
October 2016,A Truly Fantastic Experience,"From the moment I walked in the door to getting up to my room with a spectacular view this hotel provided amazing service and a spectacular holiday. There were a couple hiccups as with any hotel (the front door is automatic, but if there isn't a door man it will not always open and is exceptionally heavy), but overall I really truly recommend this hotel. They go the extra mile and it shows.   Oh and did I mention it is in Belgravia, arguably the most luxurious part of London by far."
October 2016,"Beautiful boutique hotel,Amazing staff.","This warm boutique hotel is very well located, not only for shopping since it’s very convenient for a refreshing run in hyde park. I was warmly received by a young staff and had a perfect house keeping in my room with lovely added extras each day. Breakfast is good and mostly the staff in charge,they were simply adorable,all of them. I definitely recommend the Hari !!!"
October 2016,Miss,"Excellent hotel and staff, very clean and good professional service. Breakfast was delicious. Interior is beautiful. In room massage therapist services were excellent and makeup for no hotel spa. Thank you simo for all your help & kindness it was a pleasure meeting you."
October 2016,Fabulous boutique hotel,Great part of town and a wonderful hotel.  I would highly recommend it.  Comfortable and quiet and close to so much fabulous shopping.    We didn't have breakfast or visit the bar area so I can't comment on that.  The room service however was delicious and timely.  
September 2016,Change of ownership = change in focus = missed details and lower satisfaction,"I enjoy the lhotel and the general location but the mechanical and housekeeping issues along with other minor changes like no water bottles in the gym, a much poorer selection of teas in the room with the kettle, lowered my satisfaction and impacted my ability to sleep during this trip. This issues this trip prompted me to begin negotiating a rate with the Soho hotel to offer alternative accommodation with similar amenities and location value. "
September 2016,Avoid at all cost,"Absolutely horrible avoid at all cost!! This just 2 weeks  ago use to be one of the Thomson hotels called Belgraves hotel, now it's called the Hari. I have been staying at this hotel for the last 4 years when it was under the Thomson group and it was actually great. I don't know what happened but now it's an absolute Joke!! They have a problem with house keeping the rooms are not as clean as they use to, It's been 5 days here we're the AC of the hotel don't work and at the same time it's been recorded the warmest 2 days in London!! The management is absolutely not capable of running this hotel they are not even apologizing to anyone here about this issue. I have been trying to speak to the hotel GM for the last 3 days but he has been avoiding every one. I didn't get a single…"
September 2016,Lounge and terrace,The lounge and bar was amazing. I regularly come to the place and they have the best waiters Chiara and Christian very kind and friendly. They have the best donuts that can be as a dessert and the terrace is really nice and a good place to spend the night with friends.
September 2016,Outstanding Service!,"We spent five wonderful nights at the Hari! Loved the hotel's modern decor. The service was impeccable, almost customized to each guest! Room was comfortable & cozy but needed a bit more storage space.   Pont St restaurant was amazing! Service was attentive, we felt like regulars! The food was delicious, and drinks were at a mixologist level! GREAT COFFEE & BREAKFAST!   The hotel is in a great location central to tube stations, restaurants, high end shopping, attractions, parks and easy for taxis and/or Uber!   We Cannot thank the staff enough for making our stay very memorable from Simo at the door, to Nico and Lavinia & my bartender whose name I never got at Pont St, to Joanna, Victor, Trey and staff at the front desk.    THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!  We shall be back!"
September 2016,Great hotel and location,"This hotel has just undergone a complete re-branding (much to our surprise when we showed up and thought the cab had brought us to the wrong hotel!). However, the staff were all great, our room was very nice for being in the middle of London, and the location couldn't be beat. The bar is a little snooty and overpriced."
September 2016,Wonderful stay in londons secret gem 💎,"The Hari formerly known as belgraves is understated chic, the reception and bar area is lined with raw brick with quality finishes everywhere and quirky art work. Rooms aren't the biggest in london but they are of a high standard and cosy. Guaranteed to please."
June 2016,Best Service ,I stayed in the hotel for almost one month and had the best service. Specially in the room dining Sabrina was doing great job and on time performance. I really recommend this hotel as the Sequrity level is very high & room are very modern.  
September 2016,Fantastic,"Stayed here for 2 night during business trip. Rooms are decent size for central location.. Look and feel of hotel is modern, swish and trendy so it seems to attracts  younger, trendy crowd and this gives it a nice vibe. Staff are friendly and attentive but not overbearing. Great food. Nice outdoor terrace that can be hired for private dining. Overall, great hotel that I'd recommend completely and without hesitation. "
September 2016,Great hotel!,"This is a very nice hotel.  Helpful and friendly staff, lovely interior design, great location and great food.  The bar was also excellent.  Although I recommend you order a standard bloody mary if that's your thing.  The hotel need to reconsider their version.  The bed was superb and the cleaning staff was on it.  "
September 2016,Tünde,"I stayed at Hari for 3 nights with my daughter. We love the style,the mood of the hotel, especially the bar. The location is great, the room is clean and calm.  The staff are very nice and friendly. I highly recommend the Hari to everyone. "
October 2016,Quality from start to end,Stayed in the hotel With a Group of 19 for two Nights. It is said that nothing is better that the weekest link. in this hotel there is no week links. Perfection from the doorman to the management......and still cosy
October 2016,Birthday weekend,"Lovely nights stay here for my birthday. Stayed in a studio suite and the room was amazing. Beautiful views, lovely decor. Our bathroom had a rainfall shower and a bath surrounded by a full view out the window. The bed was very comfy, amenities in the room were a lovely added extras.  Staff were amazing and extremely helpful. Only tiny thing I could say is we weren't advised of check out times or breakfast. Overall, a lovely stay and would recommend this hotel."
October 2016,Honeymooning in London,The staff was super friendly and helpful.  They made us feel like royalty. An amazing experience from start to finish.  We would highly recommend this hotel in the wealthy Belgravia section of London and would absolutely return in the future. 
October 2016,Amazing getaway,"We had an amazing time at the Hari Hotel. Localised in the center of London, next to Harrods, everything was ""à portée de main"", realy easy . We had a special attention thanks to our couple of friend that we were joining for the Week end. Champagne et truffle chocolate. The room was decorated with taste, elegance , cotemporary design with nice piece of furniture, opening on a amazing view on The City. Extremelly well fitted with everything you will need during your stay. If you are travelling to London, you can Not pass without spending a night or even more at the Hari Hôtel.  We only wish we can have stay longer."
October 2016,"Excellent, highly recommended","Nowadays it is far from normal to get the a good, professional service when purchasing good and services but I have to say 'The Hari' really delivered, they are professional and friendly, they went out of their was to make sure our stay was memorable.  Their attention to detail is second to none and I would recommend staying here over anywhere I have stayed in the UK.  The position of the hotel is set for all your shopping and evening entertainment needs.  Dave"
October 2016,Smart Hotel - Good location ,Stayed here after a recommendation from a friend. A nice boutique hotel just 5 minutes walk from Harrods. Staff are very helpful and the rooms are very nice. Paid around £220 for the room (Saturday night) including breakfast on short notice which for me was good. Would definitely stay here again
October 2016,Love this hotel,"Fab hotel for shopping in Knightsbridge/West End, the service is excellent, the staff are the best, so accommodating. We were celebrating my daughter's birthday and they made it extra special. Very cool hotel and bar. "
October 2016,The best hotel in London!,The nicest guest experience we have ever had! We had the best welcome from the FOM Alex Cohen and the events manager Marie Froger who literallly spoiled us with a lovely room. Although it was more than enough they took the time to prepare a special amenity with a picture of my husband and I with some nice chocolate truffles and Champagne! The best part is that the picture was edible! Incredible! We never experienced such a special attention and had the best time in London with our friends. Our favorite part is that you can borrow the Handy phone from your room to carry a smartphone with you. Every single part of this hotel is amazing and we would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to have the best getaway in London!
October 2016,My new favourite place in London! ,"I was staying at the Hari hotel for 4 nights and it was just perfect! The location, the bar always busy, the smoking terrace with the nice lanterns and the green plants on the walls, the decoration of the hotel and the room is very cosy, it is 10/10! About the staff they were all very nice and helpfull, at the front desk, the waiters, the housekeeping ladies, the porters such as Simo who was really amazing! Speaking so many languages, always smiling and at your service to help anytime you need! I just felt like I was at home and I didn't even want to leave :) I highly recommand this place! "
September 2016,Great location,"We selected the Hari because of its location and since we were travelling with a toddler, a decent onsite restaurant and bar. We weren't disappointed at all.  The Hari is a healthy walk away from many key sightseeing spots but also extremely convenient for cabs / uber.  The restaurant was perfect for us with healthy options for kids and adults.  The bar was nice but priced for the neighbourhood!  Our room was comfortable, clean, quiet, modern and stylish with all necessary conveniences. Being central London, space was a little tight though.  Service was professional and the door staff were helpful and welcoming."
August 2016,Belgraves is the top hotel in London,"I recommend everyone to stay at Belgraves and I am sure that you will have a great staying >  The bed is very comforbale , room is clean and quit   staff is wonderful , always they are doing their best to make the guest happy .  location of hotel is located at classy area and little bit far from the station "" 12 minutes wake ""    the only thing I don't like is the food of the hotel . my room have a complementary breakfast but unfortunately they don't have a wide variety of food   "
July 2016,"Drinks with friends, important business meetings, food served all day - this hotel covers all your needs","Whether you're looking for a great place to grab a drink with friends, unwind after a long day of work, grab a bite to eat, or conduct an important business meeting, Belgraves Hotel meets all your needs.  The ambience is contemporary, the service is stellar and the outdoor space is a welcomed bonus."
June 2016,Best Birthday Trip Ever!!,"What can I say more about my ""home away from home"" hotel?? for the 2nd time I got an upgrade and the room was amazing! I love how the staff welcome me with my name and always smiling and trying their best to make me happy!! Thats a real 5 star customer service! its a small luxurious boutique hotel with best staff who are always smiling and helping, clean neat rooms, amazing views, all room amenities are available, in room service is recommended, food is tasty, and in great location in the heart of Belgravia! Thank You for the amazing stay I had enjoy my birthday in London and will do it again Xx"
July 2016,My london residence,"A visit to London wouldn't be complete without staying at the belgraves, fab staff great location for the west end and the breakfast menu is a must to start the day! Calling in the terrace bar for that cocktail, after a full day on your feet ""......."
June 2016,"Amazing staff, great location. Nice atmosphere","I stayed here before and enjoyed it then too, it is a really nice hotel and I think it has got even better. Staff are so lovely.   Location is Superb for shopping (and we did a LOT of it). I took a lot of clothes and we bought most of Harvey Nicks/ Selfridges on top of that. I asked when booking, could we have a lot of extra hangers as we booked a room with 2 Queen beds for my mother and I and we would be shopping the sales. They actually put a separate clothes rail in with about 50 hangers! We were so happy and used it up! :)   I flew in from Singapore and had tons of meetings, inevitably on Day Two the batteries in my blood sugar monitor ran out, worst possible timing, and I had no time to get new ones. The concierge said they could sort it out for me, I gave them the weirdly…"
July 2016,Amazing,"An amazing stay....we can't wait to return. The staff were extremely helpful, the ambience was wonderful. Room was an exceptional standard with lovely products available. We felt extremely well looked after and came away feeling relaxed and refreshed."
July 2016,Outstanding,"Excellent central location, friendly and efficient service, stylish and comfortable bedrooms, sophisticated bar, scrumptious breakfast, good value for money - what more do you want in a London hotel?  I can't think of a single way in which our stay could have been improved - every single need was anticipated and met with the kind of efficiency one can only dream of.  My favourite London hotel by far."
July 2016,Absolutely amazing,Beautiful hotel and top notch service - we couldn't fault this hotel. Great location to explore London on foot and beautiful surroundings in Belgravia. The staff are on hand for any request and made our stay exceptional.
July 2016,Engagement I will never forget...first class!,"From the moment I arrived through to departure. My surprise engagement was made so special by the team at the Belgraves...I am forever thankful as is my Fiancé for making his plans run smooth! The design and style of the hotel is beautiful with modern styled classic amenities. The doorman was  friendly and genuinely remembered us every time we walked through the entrance. Ben was beyond helpful! The food was amazing and the newly crafted mojitos were amazing! The whole experience was seamless, stylish, personable and spotlessly clean and tidy. Can't wait to come back again! Thank you to an amazing team who genuinely work as a team!"
July 2016,Great hotel.,"Attentative staff. Good door man, check in lady, concierge, waiters & waitresses. Good location in Sloan square/ Belgraves. Quiet. Safe neighborhood. 10 min from Sloan tube station. Seems new and renovated. "
September 2016,Great hotel!,Great experience with professional staff and nice accommodations. The location made it easy to travel around London.  It was in a good area with nice restaurants close by.  I would definitely stay at this hotel again.
August 2016,Great Location,Rooms are modern but small.  The lighting in the room and bathroom is modern but poor light.  Hit and miss with the little treats that they give you daily from maid service.  Staff is excellent very friendly and accommodating.  
September 2016,The Hari,I have been coming to the Hari for a couple of years now and the place simply improves each time. The staff are great  and the rooms are fantastic. I am a regular visitor for business and leisure to London and would no longer contemplate any other hotel.
August 2016,Very nice hotel in a very nice part of London,"A very upmarket and well run hotel with friendly and efficient staff.  Everything is done and presented to a high standard and the price is about right for a premium part of London.  It's in the middle of Belgravia and about half way between Sloane Square and Knightsbridge, so close to Harrods etc, but best look elsewhere if you want something more budget friendly.  It's in a pretty quiet area so you are not disturbed by those fellas driving their noisy cars about to impress people."
August 2016,Central but peaceful,"I stayed at the Hari for two nights last week on business. The staff are fantastic and plenty of them! The finishing of the property is to a very high standard, every detail was perfect. The location is great as only 5 mins walk from Knightsbridge and the Kings Rd but still a peaceful location. I would definitely recommend the Hari to everyone! Good Job guys!"
July 2016,Little gem in the best part of the city,"We stayed at the Belgraves for a week from 24th-29th and we loved the modern room, the simply but sufficient facilities,  the  bar was superb!  We went to Mandarin Oriental Bar and also The Connaught bar after some recommendations and those places may have fancier presentations but the atmosphere, the Aircon and the service was far superior T the Belgrave.  I was told the hotel has been taken over by the owner of the  building branding it in his late father's name, I could see it on,y getting better.  Can't wait to go back!"" Bravo!!"
November 2015,Luxury boutique stay,"Great location, fabulous design and spacious rooms. We very much enjoyed our stay at Belgraves, the staff were very friendly and accomodating and the continental breakfast was wonderful, with fresh bread, fruit, cheeses and charcuterie. Many thanks to the reception staff for letting us check in early!"
August 2016,Birthday trip,"Everything was perfect!  The hotel is a real gem hidden in London. Close to Hyde park, Harold's and the luxurious Sloane street. The concierge, Violet, helped us with everything and made our trip amazing!"
August 2016,Perfect and the bed was amazing ,"The Belgraves met our expectations on every level.  Pre arrival messages letting us know that we could checkin early, massive welcome from reception and concierge team on arrival and stunning accommodation.  Location is perfect for central London and the real village that is Belgravia.  If your visiting the numerous embassies in the area, you're looking for world class shopping or just want to see the major sights of London then this hotel is for you.  We've been on the road for over two weeks and the bed in this hotel was the best we experienced.  Thanks for looking after us and making us feel so welcome."
August 2016,Excellent hotel,"Excellent location  , the size of the room is very good ,the hotel is very clean and very save.  Staff are friendly and will assist you with smile. The only reservation I have,the hotel have to improve the food that they provide for the breakfast.  "
June 2016,"Great location, great service, comfortable","We stayed in the Belgrave for a week while visiting Wimbledon. As it was part of a package, I don't have the direct expense of the hotel (but likely expensive).  It is in a great spot in London. Easy walking to restaurant, tube, shopping. The hotel itself has exceptional service. The rooms are average sized for London (meaning for some they might seem small) but plenty of space in my opinion. The beds are great - somewhat soft so good for side sleepers. Room was clean and quiet.   If there was one negative, their restaurant needs another coffee maker - it seemed to be their bottleneck for breakfast."
June 2016,Best Boutique Hotel in London!,Best Biutique Hotel for me in London. Location was prime and walking distance to all the stores on Sloan street. Stylish hotel. A little pricey for the small rooms but worth it. Definitely be back again
June 2016,"Thank you, Belgraves.","Our three nights here, spanning the time of the Brexit vote, met our expectations, and allowed us to see history being made up close.  The room was modern, with tasteful design, and was exceptionally clean.  We could not find a single thing in the hotel that was shabby in any respect - the hotel is immaculately maintained.  We also enjoyed the art within the hotel, ranging from Miros to Damien Hirsts and the Rolling Stones exhibition at the nearby Saatchi was very entertaining, as was our ""open day"" at Imperial College.  Our only suggestion is that the breakfast grew tiring after the second day and could have been a bit more elaborate, compared with what we had at other hotels during the same trip, but, other meals at the Belgraves (a lunch and a late night snack) more than met…"
June 2016,Superb Hotel,"Hi I have stayed in many five star hotels in London. This was my first visit to Belgraves. Amazing stay in a superb hotel, everything about our stay could not be faulted. Great location easy walk to Harrods and tube. Room was stunning, really comfy bed. All the staff were very efficient and extremely friendly. Breakfast was really good, lovely restaurant. I will definitely be booking for my next visit to London, cant wait. Many thanks to all Kevin"
June 2016,Impressive attention to detail and care for guest's experience!,"Belgraves is a case study in how a hotel should be designed and managed and more hotels should take note. The team that manages this hotel must be travelers themselves because they have looked at it from the traveler's perspective throughout. Here are just a few noticeable elements: - Rooms look good, are pristine well designed and well layed out but this is the expectation. - Staff is superb with great attitude and an attentive problem solving stance, team is smart and makes it happen. - Electric plugs available next to the bed and desk plugs offer international options. - USB charger in alarm clock and extra chargers available in the minibar drawer. - MAJOR list of complimentary items available on request, I did not take advantage of most things except: 1- In the online…"
May 2016,Terrific location in great part of London,"Excellent hotel within easy walking distance of major sites and transit.  Room was really well appointed, quiet, and great service.  Let us check in early after coming in after a long flight which was greatly appreciated.  Great service."
June 2016,BED IS SOOO COMFORTABLE,"AMAZING stay in a lovely hotel, staff are very polite and caring! beautiful restaurant and bar area! in a great area of london- only 15 minute walk to hyde park! would highly recommend- and cant wait to stay again."
May 2016,Visit to London,"The only way to describe our experience at the Belgraves is outstanding in every aspect possible! Every staff member was exceptional! Our special thanks to Andrew, General Manager!! What a fabulous team you lead! We spent 10 days with you & our thanks to Ben & concierge staff, John & his food & beverage team! You made us feel so welcome & at home! We can't say enough & we will definitely be back!  Thank you!"
May 2016,Ahmed,"The staff were all kind and supportive.  Upon checking out, I forgot important things in the safe, the front desk in charge managed to contact me and deliver everything orderly.  She asked me if it was all in order."
May 2016,Expensive but good,"Great location for the Chelsea flower show, sloan square and the museums of South Kensington. The staff were excellent and always helpful. The room was very good and the service was faultless. Would come back."
January 2016,Exceptional,"I recently stayed at Belgraves for a family birthday. I honestly can not say enough about how amazing I found this hotel. Firstly I would like to say how fantastic all the staff were in all areas of the hotel, from the meeting at greeting in reception, the bar staff, waiting staff and the chamber maids, they all did so much to make our experience truly amazing. The continental breakfast which was included in our package was the best I have ever had. We had lunch in the bar the day we were leaving, all had burgers which I am still craving. I will 100% be returning and intend on eating more in the hotel than eating out, knowing the high standards they have in food. Cant recommend this hotel enough and a fab location too!!!!"
January 2016,"great personalized service, awesome design","great personalized service, awesome design, staff was very polite and accommodating. Food was good. Breakfast buffet is a bit limited-would definitely add an omelette and vegetables. But they had more options on the menu. Banana bread was great-gluten free mus try. "
January 2016,Lovely boutique hotel is amazing location,We stayed at hotel for 1 night and we were super impressed with the hotel. The design is very cool and modern with fantastic bedrooms with everything you need. The hotel is small but has a great atmosphere. The staff were very welcoming and couldn't do enough to help us. We would stay there again - a great experience
January 2016,Lovely weekend stay,"The hotel is located in a great spot, between Knightsbridge and Sloane Square, which is ideal for shopping and getting around the city. Pont St restaurant is brilliant - great food, the menu has lots of indulgent dishes but also healthy options. The bar was really buzzy when we were there on a Saturday night and the hidden terrace was lovely for a post dinner drink. The rooms are chic and very comfortable, with the best beds I've ever slept in!"
January 2016,Wonderful Weekend-Best hotel we've been to in London!,"I booked the Belgraves for a night as a birthday surprise for my boyfriend. Upon arrival we had a warm welcoming and   easy check in.   The room we stayed in was lovely. Our room had everything we needed and more, with perfect little touches. We had the best nights sleep that we've had in a long time as the bed was so comfortable.   We ordered room service for breakfast and it was delivered right on time as requested. The food was amazing, and it was definitely the best eggs Benedict we've had.   We couldn't fault our stay one bit as everything was perfect. The staff were friendly and provided a wonderful service. The hotels facilities were great too. We will definitely be staying at the hotel again and highly recommend a stay there to anyone.  "
January 2016,Nothing can go wrong,"Congratulations for keeping the experience to the ultimate level. All very well settled, personnel as happy and helpful as always, bar and atmosphere exceptional as always. Rooms maintained to the highest standards. Congrats to management team and crew for their overall performance - rare to experience such a flawless hospitality. Best"
January 2016,First Class Hotel,"First Class Hotel, central location, rooms like your own home, chic bar, service top level, staff friendly and always remember your name and your likes etc, for a boutique hotel you cannot find better in London."
December 2015,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel , near the shopping area and Hyde park. Many good restaurant s near the hotel. The cleanliness of the commen area and the room excellent. The smoking area in the hotel is like a suspended garden very cute to take aperitif. The bar is very nice also . For the breakfast honestly can do better. Ben the concierge and a women concierge how is forgent the name are very professional and cute. "
December 2015,Wonderful stay - truly five star service,I stayed here for my birthday with my boyfriend and it was the best stay I have ever had in London. The staff were friendly and very attentive throughout the stay and couldn't have done more for us. We had champagne and strawberries in our room and brownies as it was a special occasion! The view from my room was fantastic we could see right across London. The overall atmosphere in the hotel was very relaxed and there was a great vibe in the restaurant. We did plan on going out for dinner however the restaurant came highly recommended by other guests so we ended up staying in - and were so pleased we did! The food was fantastic! We will definitely be staying again and highly recommending it to friends and family. The location is 5 minutes from Sloane Square and Hyde Park so as a…
January 2016,Beautiful Staycation,"Booked in at Belgraves to celebrate mine and my boyfriend's 5th anniversary and we were so impressed. We were given a complimentary upgrade to a beautiful suite which had fantastic views  especially from the incredible marble bathroom which overlooks a lovely square. Staff were very friendly and helpful, we really didn't want to leave the next day!"
July 2016,Best service /friendliest staff,"My all time favourite hotel in love London! The location is tremendous, views are gorgeous, the staff are beyond kind. The food and room service is impeccable and is deliciously fresh and creative ! Attention ton detail and beyond all, if you have dogs, this hotel is perfect !"
October 2015,Top Hotel,My family just returned from a trip to London with friends and finally got to stay at the HBelgraves. We had heard and read a lot about it and weren't disappointed. The service was immaculate. The rooms were very comfortable and tastefully decorated. The public areas were very impressive and set off by some amazing and sometimes quirky art work. Worth every penny we spent. We come back for sure.
July 2016,World class service,"I have just checked out of Belgraves and can not thank them enough for a perfect stay. The hotel I was due to stay in around the corner didn't have my reservation, so I booked into Belgraves last minute. On arriving at the hotel I encountered complete professionalism / world class hospitality and utter luxury... I cant thank them enough for looking after me last night. I will be booking into this hotel to experience all the luxuries for a proper trip very soon..."
September 2015,Love!,"I absolutely loved this boutique hotel.  It was located in the beautiful Belgravia section of London which we found during a tour was the ""rich"" area where all the Consulates are and very very old money resides.  It was quiet, streets were lined with gorgeous old perfectly maintained homes and disgustingly expensive sports cars parked on the streets like they were Fords.  I mean I've never seen so many Ferrari's, Lambos and other things.   The room was kind'of tight but had a seating area and a separate bedroom.  The bathroom was nice and modern and the hotel toiletries were nice and smelled wonderful.   It was loud when those sports cars tore off --- we could hear everything from the street below and I did have to sleep with ear plugs in.   Staff were very friendly and helpful…"
July 2016,chris from NY,"friendly, professional staff. Great location, quiet yet close to restaurants, shopping, action. Made a point of remembering my name and addressing me so. Comfortable, clean room, provided welcomed travel amenities such as int'l adaptors"
June 2016,Some of the best service I've ever encountered,"Everyone working at the hotel was genuinely friendly and helpful. Of course, the facilities and room were all excellent, but the great service and vibe of the hotel due to the staff is what really made the place."
September 2015,So friendly!,"A lovely, not to big hotel in London! Stayed here for my birthday and it was perfect. Staff were attentive and couldn't do enough for us.Would come back in a flash! Room was spotless, and quiet, we may have been lucky, but there was no sounds from neighbouring rooms early in the morning or late on at night, a win in my books!"
June 2016,Good small business hotel,"I use this hotel everytime I stay overnight in London and it is very convenient. Located a few blocks from Knightbridge, it is within a cosy neighborhood with some restaurant options. The rooms are ok for a London hotel and the staff is always very friendly. Choice depends really on where you have your meeting in London."
June 2016,The most friendliest hotel I've ever stayed in,"Great cocktails, great location too. I brought my husband here for his 50th, I could not fault anything about the hotel.  It made our stay even more special! Thanks to Ben, head concierge. If only customer care was like this, in all walks of life. Take note people."
July 2016,Outstanding Service and Pet Friendly,"We have just returned from this amazing hotel after a 2 night stay booked at the last minute due to our first night in an apartment from hell in Kensington. I didn't have much time to do any research on this hotel like I usually do as we were already in London and had to find alternative accommodation very quickly that would accept our dog. Belgraves was the second hotel that I contacted and I was relieved to discover they were pet friendly and what an excellent choice I made. The service at this hotel is OUTSTANDING from the minute you check in to the moment you leave, after being in our room for around 15 minutes we had a phone call asking if everything was ok, they later bought cookies and water and in the evening asked if we would like a turn down service. We requested a…"
May 2016,Boutique hotel in Belgravia,"Nice hotel with a classy decor, little but complete gym, a lounge with sofas and nice photobooks. The staff is very kind, professional and smart. The buffet breakfast is not huge in quantity but great bin quality, and you can have free hot dishes a la carte (and a good espresso). Out of the door you will be in the middle of the embassy area, sorrounded by beautiful mansions, best shops and 10 minutes walk from Harrods/V&A/Saatchi Gallery/Sloane square ...."
February 2016,Perfect Valentines day stay!,"I stayed here for a night away with my boyfriend, it was amazing! Room had lovely great size bed, walk in shower and over all I loved the style of the room and hotel itself. Based a walk away from harrods and knightsbridge station, only let down is that there was not any restaurants we found within walking distance. Overall fantastic area and will defiantly be coming back!"
May 2016,"Perfect spot, great service",The first pleasant surprise was a lovely early check in after having flown in from Australia - add to that an unexpected room upgrade which was just lovely. The rooms are great sizes for London and are very nicely appointed. Molton Brown toiletries are a very nice touch. The staff were very attentive and went out of their way to help or offer you something. As I'm typing this after checkout I have already had the offer of a complimentary morning coffee while I sit on the comfy couches in the foyer. There are quite a few great spots to sit and relax. Big thanks to Nico for making brekky a fun start to the day each morning. I would definitely stay here again.
May 2016,London in May,The only issue was London was having a heat wave in May....28c and the air con struggled to cope but they were quick to bring a fan. Belgravia is a fantastic area....very neighbourhood like but Kensington and Chelsea 20 minutes walk away. The staff are fantastic....I could not fault anyone
May 2016,Wonderful hotel,Very sophisticated hotel. Just 5 minutes walk from knightbridge in a very chic area.  The rooms are very confortable with nice interior decoration. Nice restaurant and bar to meet with friends. Perfect for business travel 
April 2016,A very ple.asant hotel!!,"No complaints at all!!  The Belgrave is one of the nicest London hotels that I have stayed in.  It situated in a lovely location, away from the hustle and bustle of busy London.  The staff couldn't be more helpful.  We only stayed for one night but would happily return.  Everything was great.  Top marks for cleanliness, topped off with extremely comfortable beds and bedding!!"
April 2016,Very comfortable hotel in a calm part,"I have spent two days in this hotel. It is really chic, clean, quiet. Great service, very friendly staff and very good location in a quiet part of Belgravia, walking distance from Harrod's and Harvey Nichols."
April 2016,Superb!,Great hotel. Subtle and sleek with the most amazing staff. Extremely comfortable rooms and really loved the bar especially well looked after by Nabil.  Will be back on next visit to London when I will bring the family.
April 2016,Overnight stay,"A very comfortable boutique hotel, with a nice atmosphere in the bar/lounge area.  Staff were very helpful, although the bar was a little busy and service a bit slow late evening.  Rooms were really clean, bed was very comfortable.  Ask for a room high up or at the back, as 'super cars' were out early hours of morning and quite noisy - this could have been a once off.  I would definitely recommend this for a convenient and friendly hotel in the heart of London."
April 2016,A room with a view,"We arrived today and got a room at 9. Floor wow, great view over the London Skyline. The staff is very kind , the hotel could need some new brush-up, the room is not up-to modern interior, old contacts need more equipment to  mobile phones . It is very quiet when you close the aircondition .  Location is great in Belgravia."
December 2015,location location location!,"Loved this hotel! Location is excellent: on a very quiet square but just two steps off Sloane Street and all the glam shops.  The architect/designer has done a great job with the rooms: we had a superior king (the entry level room) and although it is quite a small room, the allocation of space is amazing with an enormous and comfortable shower. Bath in marble, wooden floor in the rest of the room. Lovely colors, excellent textile's choices.  Only 2 small flaws: night table lights were not independent (so either you both read or both sleeps) and there was not a plug for the hair dryer in the bathroom or in any vicinity of a mirror (so I had to dry and comb my hair using a lot of fantasy...). Lovely young staff and very helpful, cleaniless was excellent, evening downturn perfect…"
December 2015,We will return again and again and again...,"What a wonderful find!  Fabulous location, walking distance to Harrods, Sloane Square and Pimlico.  The hotel itself is one of the friendliest and most welcoming hotels we have stayed at in London.  The bar serves superb cocktails and there's a delightful cigar terrace outside.  Rooms are spacious, well designed, stylish and comfortable.  The bed was incredibly comfortable, which is so important but not always the case in hotels.  The hotel was immaculate throughout the public areas and the bedroom and bathroom.  This hotel really is a home from home, comfort is key and the staff just could not do enough for us.  We will return again and again and again."
December 2015,Nice Hotel & Better Staff,"Good location, close to all that matters in Knightsbridge & Belgravia. A well put together product, still in good shape in the rooms. Excellent staff throughout the hotel. A pleasure to stay in; we'll be back."
December 2015,Luxury chic,"Awesome, cutting edge. Every detail is taken care of. The room, exquisitely decorated, and the bathroom were full of light. Flawless. I had a beautiful night sleep. Attentive staff, very NY style. Not to miss out."
December 2015,Great location and super staff modern hotel in Chelsea,"Corner of Pont and Chesham street is this small boutique modern hotel that we stayed in via FHR amex booking. Staff very friendly and accommodating, rooms are warm and cosy and bathroom and large shower modern and clean. We dined in the restaurant downstairs for breakfast and it was fast and very good. This is a great location of walking to all nearby areas including the Kings road/Slone Sq, Bromton Road, or Buckingham Palace and St James's area. Would stay again!"
October 2015,Great Hotel - Even Better Staff!,"What a great hotel.  Modern, comfortable lobby and rooms. Great location. Ridiculously helpful staff! Door men were friendly and on the spot, front desk was knowledgeable, and helpful, even the turn down maid was impressive.  I had a delicious breakfast in the ground floor restaurant where I found they were serving water in some glasses I have been looking for years, when I asked where they got them, the whole staff went above and beyond to not only source them, but find me a full set!  Katrina (?), the General Manager, the food and beverage manager, and breakfast host went out of their way to get these for me and I am so thankful.  When I first arrived, I thought my room was a bit small (I choose the smallest room), but it was so well laid out that I never felt cramped.  The…"
December 2015,Belgraves - what an excellent choice!,"We stayed at Belgraves on a Thursday and Friday night as was working in the SW1 area and had a function in Central London on the Friday.  I arrived separately to my partner, and found to my delight it was only a 10 minute walk from London Victoria train station.   The hotel is set around the lovely Belgravia streets, and embassy central making it a very pleasant area.  After checking in an dropping off my bags, I went to the 1st floor to use the fitness centre - I had the whole place to myself (as usual in smaller hotels!) and the gym was thoroughly kitted out - fresh towels, apples, water, top equipment, good stretch out space, a cable machine and free-weights. Totally spoiled for choice!  I was staying in a Deluxe king room, and it was very nicely made up - my sort of style -…"
December 2015,Stunning Hotel & Outstanding Customer Service,"I booked this hotel for our accommodation during our Company Christmas Party (10 rooms).  From the offset, I found the Sales Manager (Giuseppe) to be fantastic.  Nothing was too much trouble and he organised our stay to finite detail (even upgrading my MD and surprising him with a Birthday Cake, and taking good care of the Events Organiser :-)  It's the personal touches like these that make a stunning hotel an OUTSTANDING hotel!  The décor is very chic and trendy... very 'cool Britannia'!   I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in the Knightsbridge area.  Thanks again to Giuseppe and the rest of the staff at the Belgraves."
December 2015,What a great find! ,We were searching for a boutique hotel for our wedding anniversary. This was perfect. Combination of feel of the place and the service. The staff were very welcoming and the room was excellent - even though we booked last minute deal. There was champagne in the room. Small things make a big difference. In our case we used valet parking and forgot about the time on Sunday. When we got back the doorman had picked up our car to avoid the extra half day charge. Really thoughtful service. Thank you for surprising us in a positive way. Used to different types of surprises in London hotels. 
December 2015,Great Hotel in the middle of London,"I just had the great opportunity to stay the first time at the Belgrave a Thompson Hotel and it was fantastic. Anita who checked me in and out was absolutely friendly and knew about my reason to stay at the hotel. Without asking she informed me about the location of the event I needed to attend in the city. Well done. The rooms are beautifully decorated and have the normal size for a London hotel. After all it is a boutique hotel that offeres great comfort. The location is great as well, within walking distance to Harrods and Buckingham Palace. I loved the breakfast setting and buffet and the friendliness of all staff members. Everybody greeted me whenever and wherever I met an employee.   Please ignore the comments from the previous review about small rooms and small lifts.…"
March 2016,"Small rooms, friendly staff, busy bar","We stayed here for two nights recently in a King Deluxe room.  The room was very small, we were dancing round each other to get our stuff out of the wardrobe.  Also the bathroom was small, only one person in there at a time.  All clean though, with a nice view of the Shard and the London Eye.  The tv turned itself on in the middle of the night for some unknown reason but this was fixed the next day when I reported it to reception.  There were nice homemade biscuits at turndown but the turndown housekeeper seemed very stressed both nights and we told her not to worry about our turndown in the end.  Staff here are very friendly, particularly the doormen who are great.  They offer a cheese and wine hour to guests but it was not at all well supported although we did enjoy it - free…"
March 2016,Birthday weekend trip to London,"This is the second time we have stayed in this hotel.  We usually opt for staying around Marylebone, but glad we chose the Belgraves for my birthday weekend.  We were with my two daughters, who also loved the hotel, so no doubt they will choose to stay there again, as we will, hopefully for longer next time.  The staff are excellent and it has a very personal feel.  The common areas are very stylish, and a great atmosphere."
April 2015,Wonderful hotel in a beautiful location,The hotel oozes cool. The neighborhood obviously is wonderful. It's an oasis to come home to after a day all over London. Can't wait to return. Rooms are a very decent size. Bathrooms are a bit small especially if you have 2 people. Otherwise it's all you can expect from Thompson hotels. Staff are helpful. Unfortunately we stayed over London Marathon weekend so it was a bit hectic but this doesn't take anything away from the hotel and it's services. I can't recall about wifi being free or pay. So I've put down not sure.
December 2015,Home away from home ❤️,"I was in London to celebrate New Year so I stayed there for 10 days (Dec/15 to Jan/16) and it was my 4th or 5th (I lost count) stay at the Belgraves! The min. I arrive I was as usual welcomed with my name by the lovely staff (reception and concierge) who surprised me with an upgrade from King Deluxe to Studio Suite which was the best room I ever stayed in! the studio was spacious and the view was breath-taking ❤️ I will always go back to them, best area so quiet yet so close to sloane st, knightsbridge station, harvey nichols and harrods! The rooms are spacious clean and have all the amenities you need with amazing views of Belgravia! The staff are always smiling and willing to answer your questions they are so helpful and friendly ❤️ I always recommend the hotel for family and…"
March 2016,Brilliant,"This hotel is great.  The rooms are  a little bit small but who goes to London to stay in their hotel room?!  Perfect location for wandering, shopping, dining etc.   Wonderful staff who were always friendly and helpful - nothing was too much trouble.   (and there was a fabulous smell in the lobby - meant to ask what it was - it was lovely!!)  I can't imagine staying anywhere else in London.  Thank you for making my Birthday weekend so special.  (If I had any gripe at all it would be the rather grumpy barman serving in the hotel bar on Saturday night but maybe he was just having a bad day & I only mention it because it was quite a stark contrast to the cheery nature of his colleagues!!)"
March 2016,Amazing ❤️,Just back from this amazing hotel and had to write a review. We were made to feel so special and didn't want to leave. The added touches and small gestures make such a big difference.  Valentin on front desk was so friendly and every member of staff engaged with us and had a natural way of making us feel welcome.  The rooms are amazing and the bed was the most comfortable we've ever slept in. Breakfast in Pont st was delicious too.  Best hotel we've been to and can't wait to return. 
March 2016,Just perfect,"I was coming to London for one night only and booked this hotel as my meetings were being held here. What I loved the most was that the hotel treated me like an individual and not just another number or income generator. From the doorman to the front desk to the concierge to the wait staff at the restaurant & bar, the service was impeccable. I really feel as if this is the best business hotel I have ever stayed at. In addition, lovely rooms and big bathrooms (rare for London) with fantastic amenities. Everything was really well thought out and look forward to my next stay."
February 2016,Quiet room,"Stayed again this year at this great situated hotel at Chesham place.  Room 2001 great size all facilities catered for, only downside was the view of the heating system outside but it didn't distract from the quiet room which is very important to us.  Great addition this year for us was the fridge/mini bar which is great when staying for 3 days we were able to make a drink in our room and put the milk in the fridge. This hotel is so well situated for Sloane Square and Kings Road only 5/10 mins away.  Close to Knightsbridge and museums too , everything you could want from a hotel. The breakfast was superb, the continental is great with so many choices....our favourite the huge fresh fruit bowl and home made bread and the meat/cheese choice...we loved it. All the staff we met were…"
March 2016,Boutique Hotel in the heart of London ,"Unconventional hotel with medium size rooms. Low light, wood and low ceilings contribute to creating a cozy atmosphere. Art is everywhere.  The staff is friendly and professional. They contribute to creating a business casual environment. One the good value on the Belgravia neighborhood."
March 2016,Superb!,"Hotel was superb, service was outstanding, coffee is the best in London!  Enjoyed food in the bar which was great. Breakfast was excellent. The bar is cool, hip and relaxing. Typical of a Thompson hotel, overall, probably the best in London in my opinion."
August 2015,great place,the staff at the belgraves are so friendly the decor is hip the rooms are very clean food is delicious the location is perfect for shopping lovers and close to some very important attractions such as hyde park harrods knights bridge and buckingham palace
February 2016,Wonderful staffs,It is a great hotel which located in a very nice area. When I was there and I find out that lost my phone in a uber. I asked the staffs there for help. They are very patient and tried their best to help me. They are Matia and Ismael. Very friendly and helpful people. They let me to use the phone there to call my phone and they  told the driver to bring my phone back to Belgraves. Finally I got my phone back. Thanks a lot again. Everyone should go there and I am sure that you will have a great time there. 
February 2016,Perfection in details,"I'm not a native English speaker, but I feel that I should right about this hotel to pay them back for the great time.  Tylhey helped me celebrate my wife's birthday in a very special way. Room arrangements, upgrade, flowers, special dinner from Chef Sophie, and finally amazing breakfast and complementary gifts delivered to the our room. That's all in addition to beautiful decorations, welcoming staff, cleanliness, beaty, comfort, and harmony in every detail. Truly unforgettable stay!!"
January 2016,Just touched down in london town,"Was able to spend 5 nights in London at the end of January. The hotel was beautiful and luxurious. Central location walking distance to two different tube lines and the tourist stop Harrods. Staff were very accommodating and lovely. All the Door men were always helpful, Diego on concierge was always helpful and provided us with tickets to an event we couldn't get tickets too, Would love to return to this hotel again."
February 2016,perfect stay in london,Perfect location. Excellent concierge services and service in general. Had a perfect stay in London. Staff at front desk and hotel reception very helpful. A big thank you to Simo for running after our cab with my husband s laptop when leaving for the airport...
February 2016,Very nice,"Great location, great arquitecture, great service.  Ver nice bar. Rooms are small but very nice. Just hated the WC, very uncomfortable.  The rooms may have more light, they look nice but are dark.  Everything else is great."
November 2015,Fantastic weekend!!,Came to stay at Belgraves for the first time and struggle to find anything bad to say! The room was cosy with a great ensuite with luxury molten brown toiletries which was a bonus! Staff were friendly and more than happy to help with any queries. I had forgotten my hairbrush and they happily provided a comb.Our two night stay was only made better by the delicious breakfast! Would absolutely return tomorrow!
February 2016,Fantastic stay,"Recently stayed at the Belgraves for 2 nights with my partner. We were staying on the top floor in a suite. It was very comfy and the space well used. The room had everything we could have needed. The bed was large and very comfortable. We had great views of the London eye, Big Ben and the Shard. The hotel was very quiet and the Windows did a great job of blocking out noise from the busy streets below. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Thank you for a great stay, hope to be back soon!"
February 2016,Nice hotel with a few drawbacks,"Great-looking hotel with an impressive entrance. Receptionists were all stunning but vaguely irritable and required a deposit on arrival (we'd pre-paid for the room) plus photocopies of both of our IDs and both of our full names and contact information. I guess they thought we might nick something? Not the most flattering arrival experience.   The room was nice but small. Free wifi in the rooms was absolutely fine for our needs, and a great feature. We had a King Deluxe which was advertised as the larger of the basic rooms. I'm not sure what size the King Superior is but would guess that it would be a bit cramped for two people. Had an ancient iPod dock on the bedside table that wouldn't work with any newer generations or any other brands of phone, ultimately a bit of a waste of…"
February 2016,GREAT REVISIT,"Fantastic located, Hip Hotel, great trendy doormen to great you!, Articulate staff who are very organised .... The bar has an outside terrace which is a great place  to catch up with friends.  The rooms are compact but with space, comfortable beds ready to catch you after a day of retail therapy! Dont forget to try the breakfast its a must , Go on treat yourself and go for the full english, you will walk it off in no time London!"
February 2016,Superb accomodation & outstanding staff,"I couldn't fault anything about my stay at Belgraves. The staff were attentive and made you feel welcomed from the start. Pont St restaurant is not to be missed. The food is outrageously good. I would 100% recommend Belgraves, and look forward to my next visit there. "
February 2016,Valentines in Belgravia,"Very smart and chic hotel centrally located for Knightsbridge and Chelsea. Excellent accommodation and great service provided by all staff. Highly recommended especially for American visitors due to proximity of major attractions.  Restaurant is very good and the bar comfortable with top quality cocktails. As part of the Thompson group the bohemian design is married to Belgravia smart  not an easy combination but the feel is both smart and welcoming, so they pulled it off. We are booked in again. "
February 2016,Always good to come back to the Belgraves,"Best hotel in London by far. Great service, cosy and unique ambience and nice neighbourhood. Got an upgrade again and staff were really helpful with everything. Try the breakfast at the Pont st restaurant downstairs and sit by the window to enjoy some natural light"
February 2016,Truly perfect stay,"Lovely hotel with nice little added touches.  The staff are what really made our stay-They pay Attention to detail, are personable, genuinely friendly and clearly love their job of providing their guests with the wow factor! Will definitely return."
January 2016,"Excellent experience, great hotel!",My partner and I stayed twice in the last few months and on both occasions had an amazing stay! We staying in King Premium rooms which have the little seating area in the window; perfect for looking out over the area. The beds are incredibly comfortable and we both love the rainfall showers and Molten Brown products. We had dinner in the Pont St. Restaurant on both occasions and each time really enjoyed our meals in the cosy booth tables. Ekaterina served us on both occasions in the evening and Bryan was always a friendly face in the morning for breakfast. We tried out the smoking terrace as well and it's a great area for relaxing with a good cocktail and a cigar from their selection. Would definitely return again in future if the opportunity arises. Belgraves has an excellent…
February 2016,Relaxed and very professional,well located near 2 tube stations. Excellent service with multilingual employees who enjoy their jobs. Rooms are compact with quality finishes. Great restaurant. Management are clearly doing something right.
February 2016,Rarefied excellence,"Spent 3 nights here.  The level and consistency of service from all the staff was beyond reproach.  Staff are empowered, very proactive and focused on making sure all the details are taken care of. This was a rarefied level of service that was beyond exceptional.  Made for a fantastic stay."
February 2016,Cool lonely and just best,"Just on Belgravia in  London around our corner is this restaurant. A Female Chef. Just great. Fresh , cool , and relaxed. .  So very nice super fresh food. Just perfect. We ate all 3 meals in the menus. We shred and we loved it. Great🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 So we went back the next morning dor breakfast and we got again surprised with this restaurant. "
February 2016,Cosiest boutique hotel ,Not only it's lovely sitting at the outdoor terrace in summer or at the lounge area you just feel at home. One of the very very few hotels that gave me a certificate for the DELTA deaf children charity without any hesitation. The GM was very accommodating and FYI this is the trendiest place to hang out during the day or late evening.
January 2016,5* plus!! ,We stayed here after visiting the New York sister hotel last year. We were not disappointed! Friendly helpful staff who were down to earth rather than like robots in most 5* hotels. A very helpful concierge who booked us a few London attractions. She would always stop to chat. Friendly wait staff in the bar and amazing restaurant! This hotel is defiantly worth a visit even if it's just to sample their coffee!!! Yummy! Thanks to all. 
April 2016,"Excellent service, great location, small rooms","We are refurbishing our flat and decided to stay for a few days at this place which is a few hundred yards from where we live. We reserved a suite, i.e a small lounge, bed room and a tiny bath room with one sink and just the space to hardly move (One person at a time). The service in this hotel is great and the staff very dedicated and efficient. We had a logistic problem in our room and they did everything they could to solve it. I like the place but I am not sure I could accept a so tiny space for such a price. I have been staying in tens of hotel in London and never had this clostrophobic feeling. Apart from that, the hotel is classy and pleasant."
August 2015,Quiet location But in heart of London !,"I love this small hotel, very comfy and staff is the friendliest I dealt with.   rooms are well designed and decorated. Bathrooms are stunning I loved them.   Location is one of the main features of this hotel, In the heart of Lonodn.   Will stay here again for sure. (was not our 1st time)"
April 2016,"Young, cool and efficient concierge","A modern hotel, cool and young vibe, perfect quiet location but still in the center of London, 10 min walk from Harrods. Reception staff are extremely friendly and nice. I was very happy with their concierge service, Ben was very helpful and efficient, he managed to get us a table at the restaurant i exactly wanted (which is very hard to get during this period) at the exact hour i have requested. It is already my 5th time in this hotel, and i keep on coming back. Thank you for this great service."
April 2016,Great service.,"Everyone who works there is friendly and lovely and the service is fantastic.  Housekeeping is quick and efficient and always on time.  And the concierge -- Violetta -- was very helpful on this trip, finding me several restaurants to try."
April 2016,Fab hotel !!!,Thank you so much for an amazing stay !!we celebrated our 10 year anniversary and the stay was amazing from our arrival the concierge could not be more helpful and  the check in was swift and polite and went out of there way. we arrived to champagne in our room along with chocolate strawberries.  Thank you so much for a unforgettable stay we will recommending you  to friends and family in the future.  Fab rooms and super friendly staff  Thanks again  
April 2016,What a find. Excellent,"Such a great location and a hotel that gets service - everyone so friendly, charming and immensely capable.  Stylish decor that creates a relaxing atmosphere.  Overall a hotel with substance and genuine hospitality which is rare these days.  Particularly want to mention Brian in the Restaurant who went above and beyond at our exquisite lunch.  We will be back soon."
March 2016,Best service possible,The second you arrive MATTIA is at the door giving you undivided attention and helping you every way he can. SIMONA at the front desk gave me all the extra knowledge needed to get around the city. At last but by far not least CELIA put forth the most effort to make me feel welcome at the hotel by going above and beyond. KEEP THOSE THREE HAPPY!!! They are the key to your success.
March 2016,Great service,Thank you to Simona for the outstanding service. We honestly had the best hotel experience in many years thanks to the staff mainly. We recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to have a calm and sophisticated stay in London. 
March 2016,"Great location, lovely stay!","We stayed here, expecting high standards owing the location is the very upscale Belgravia. The hotel isn't the prettiest, but the check in, housekeeping, door staff and room service were excellent. We had a minor issue with the food quality when we ate in the restaurant for one evening meal, but otherwise we had a very enjoyable stay. The 10 min walk to the tube station at Sloan Square wasn't a problem at all, and the door staff were excellent at getting us a cab when we needed it. Our room was a little on the small side, but this is Central London after all, but well appointed bathroom and facilities. Overall a very enjoyable stay. "
March 2016,"Great location, friendly staff","Great location: walking distance from Sloane's Square, Kings Road, Harrods and Knightsbridge Quick access to public transport to the City or other parts of town. In a residential neighbourhoods, quiet, but within short distance of many restaurants and shops. Rooms are modern, nicely appointed, albeit on the small side. Nice evening turndown service with water and homemade cookies provided. Staff was polite and friendly.  Would certainly use again next time I am back in London."
November 2015,Nice stay,"Stayed three nights at the Belgraves.  It was a very nice hotel, great staff, good food.  The place is very stylish, with wonderful design elements in the lobby, lounge and rooms.  Note that the desks in the rooms are small, compared to true business hotels.  The staff all called me by name and were very accommodating.  The location is excellent.  I had one problem -- the bed in my first night's room sagged considerably in the middle, which I didn't know until I awoke at 3 a.m. in discomfort.  I reported it the next morning and they moved me to a different room (they originally were going to upgrade me for my troubles, but that didn't pan out.)  The new room and bed were great.    I would stay at the Belgraves again."
November 2015,Great experiencie. Best hotel to stay in london,"I would like to really highlight the exquisite service by all the staff; from recpeption and concierge to the bell boys. Specially Simo, Simone and Mattia, who took very good care of me and my friends.  The rooms were really comfortable and well decorated. The breakfast was really enjoyable.  All in all, a great experience. I will definetly come back.   Soledad Suarez "
November 2015,Marvelous Stay,"What an incredible hotel.  The property itself was stunning and alive and the restaurant was spectacular.  This was only outdone by the warm, friendly informative and caring staff.  I was so impressed from the moment I stepped out of the car and was greeted by Isreal and Mattia (the bell men) they escorted me into the beautiful lobby where the front desk crew took it from there.  The other bell men Simo, Simone and Mike were also on it through out the stay.  Anita, Hayley and Celia as well as others were so caring and made me feel at home.  Violetta the concierge hooked us up every night for dinner and tickets to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which was so much better that either movie.  The whole crew including the restaurant staff and especially the bar upstairs were…"
November 2015,Exquisite stay at Belgraves,"I have travelled the world and this is one of the loveliest hotels I've ever stayed out. The staff were so attentive -from the bellman to the concierge. Everyone was so helpful and really seemed to be invested in ensuring an excellent stay for us. The front desk staff remembered us and were helpful every step of the way.  The hotel itself  is in a perfect location with some of the best restaurants and shopping that London has to offer within walking distance.   The hotel was classy and chic and simply breathtaking. The attention to detail every step of the way was the perfect balance between decadent and feeling at home. The bars were comfy and refined and the cigar bar was not to be missed.  If you have the chance, I wouldn't stay anywhere else but The Belgraves. Thank you!!!!"
November 2015,Great...,"Spent two night here and we enjoyed every bit. We were on the 9th floor with a balcony with direct views of St Pauls cathedral and London skyline - the bed is very cosy and comfortable and everything you needed in a room was there.  The location is great, everything we needed was within walking distance - which was great after finishing work and checking in.  Staff are attentive and courteous. Breakfast was DELISH!  They also do afternoon tea there which is great! Highly recommend!  "
October 2015,Great stay from start to finish - we will definitely stay again!,"From the moment we walked into the hotel we enjoyed every minute of our stay. The check in was efficient and friendly, the ladies were both helpful and a pleasure to speak with. We had been upgraded to a larger room which was an added bonus, we'd assumed this was because we were celebrating both our birthdays and wedding anniversary but our friends who also stayed had the same upgrade. The room was very nice with a decent view, great size and a very comfortable bed. We arrived back after a wonderful evening out to find a bottle of champagne and fruit bowl in our room, what a great touch! Check out wasn't until 12pm so we weren't rushing and then we were able to leave our luggage with concierge. We certainly felt our custom was appreciated and the hotel now has to be one of our…"
November 2015,Bravo!,"This is hotel is the definition of the boutique hotel. It has the proper size. Not to small so that its bar and its restaurant are alive and not big so as to have a standard impersonal service.  The staff of the hotel is excellent. From the doormen to the receptionists to the waiters. All young people, eager to help you and make your life easier.  The location of the hotel is top. Best shopping in London within walking distance. Knightsbridge tube 7 minutes away walking distance as well. Super safe to go around anytime of the day or night as all the embassies are located in the area.  Design of the hotel and the rooms simply amazing though this is something ambiguous as beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Room size are on the smallish side but this is something that you do…"
November 2015,"Location, great value and terrific service","I stay here at least twice a month and this hotel always delivers with great attention to detail and personal preferences, friendly and efficient service and an unbeatable location, close to all the restaurants, museums and shopping in Knighstbridge, Chelsea and Belgravia, and a short taxi ride or walk into the West End of London - and it has a gym, restaurant and terrace bar. It is a very short taxi ride from Victoria railway station for trains to Gatwick airport, and also offers quick access to Heathrow airport via the motorway."
September 2015,nice hotel,i have visited friends who stayed in the hotel. great little place.the outdoor coffee place is lovely. the rooms are modern and boutiquey.i have been trying to stay there but its hard to get a booking.tks 
October 2015,Luxury at affordable price - outstanding customer service!,"I picked the Belgraves due to its location and price point and after reading the other reviews decided to give it a try. I have stayed at the Lanesborough Hotel,which is nearby, but at more than double the price it wasn't in my budget this trip. I must say the attention to welcoming guests, making sure they are comfortable and their needs met was superb at the Belgraves! Upon check in they sent tea to my room (my friend had coffee as she requested) and were attentive to any of our needs. they serve complimentary cheese and wine every night for an hour in their lovely bar on the first floor. If i was waiting form friend someone would come to ask if I needed a drink while i was waiting. The rooms were extremely nice and my Jr. Suite had a little alcove with a couch to enjoy…"
July 2015,Amazing service,"The hotel is centrally located for easy acces to Sloane street , Harrods and kings road. Service levels are second to none, they will assist and help with all requests.  Totally recommend The Belgraves."
June 2015,Redefining Luxury - Belgraves,"My experience at Belgraves, a Thompson Hotel was nothing short of superior.  It was so good I returned within 2 weeks.  My first stay I had a king premium room, which catered to my needs perfectly.  I spent a lot of time outside the hotel, but returning was an absolute delight.  The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive, without being pushy or overbearing.  The room was incredibly comfortable, perfect for relaxing after a busy day. When I returned a few weeks later I was able to enjoy the additional luxury of a studio suite.  It was so comfortable I spent more time at the hotel than I had originally intended.  One of my guilty pleasures is to have a bath before going to bed, so the well designed marble bathroom made this experience extra special.  I first booked…"
July 2015,A wonderful experience,"We stayed here a week. The staff was very attentive and helpful. Great with directions and information. Room was lovely. Love the turndown service with bottled water and cookies. Had room service one evening, and the food was excellent. Would stay here again,"
July 2015,Great Boutique hotel in posh hood,"We had a great stay at the Belgraves and it felt very much like a Kimpton Hotel (before IHG takeover) in the USA which is a great compliment.  I would say it's one of the top properties we have visited in a European city.  Pros: - very friendly and helpful staff across door staff, front desk and housekeeping - views from 11 floor corner room were amazing and multiple windows revealed close to a 270 degree view including small walk out balcony - room was modern and clean with nice touches such luxury bath products, slippers, and evening treats in turndown service  - location is convenient to underground and major sites - neighborhood is very peaceful and quiet with really ornate apartment blocks on different styles   Cons (very minor): - for room price, it would have been nice to…"
July 2015,Great hotel with very helpful staff,Stayed one night at this hotel.  Great location for Hyde Park and Kensington Palace and Royal Albert Hall - all within easy walking distance. Staff were very helpful and certainly made us very welcome.  Always on hand to help without being overbearing.  Food in the restaurant was outstanding - the crab ravioli was delicious!  My only wish was that I'd asked for a kettle for making tea so I could have had a cuppa first thing in the morning - this was complimentary but you had to ask for it to be brought to the room.  There was a tassimo coffee machine in the room but no instructions! Wasn't too worried though - would have preferred tea!
July 2015,Summer getaway,"The single best choice in hotels made this trip to London. In a city, where you're not starved for choice, The Belgraves proved to be a stand out selection and one we'll return to on our future trips to London.  From entry to exit a fantastic experience. The attentive and helpful doorman, the experienced and sharp staff at check in and concierge who was accessible and available when required all presented themselves well, while not becoming overbearing.  We were scheduled to check in at 3:00, yet arrived 2 hours early and while fully expecting to wait for our room, which seems to be typical for London, were refreshed to find the room available and allowed to check in and freshen up prior to heading back out. We recognize this may not always be possible, however were extremely…"
July 2015,Fabulous Hotel Experience,"The Belgraves London Hotel is one of the best hotel experiences ever. The room design and quality is top notch and the friendly professional service is truly outstanding. From the lobby to the restaurant to the gym and the room service, all details are expertly taken care of so you can enjoy a fabulous experience. The Belgraves will always be my first choice London hotel."
July 2015,A fantastic stay,"We had an overnight stay at the Belgraves Hotel and I can't rate it highly enough. On arrival the staff were very friendly and polite & we were made to feel very welcome. We were asked if we were celebrating an occasion & we told them it was our wedding anniversary.  We were congratulated and had our room upgraded and were given a complimentary bottle of champagne. This was the perfect start to our celebrations.  The room was great, very stylish as is the whole hotel. The bathroom was very nice with a great double shower.  The bed and furnishings were very comfortable and luxurious.  The Hotel is just a joy to be in, the dimmed lighting and amazing furniture give it such a cool feeling.  The bar area was good and we sat out on the terrace enjoying a couple of gin & tonics - nice…"
June 2015,Lovely and helpful staff,"I know hotel rooms in London are small but our room was tiny. So small in fact the first thing reception suggested to us was up-grading. Not the arrival I had been looking forward to.   The staff were all lovely and very helpful. The hotel is modern with a good vibe and a decent bar. Location is good for walking around Belgravia and Westminster. Its only a 10 minutes walk to Knightsbridge Tube and Harrods (boring and over rated).    Not somewhere I would rush back to, there was nothing wrong with it but I would rather try somewhere else on my next visit."
July 2015,Wimbledon Respite,"Most accommodating staff, well managed and we most appreciated our room being available to us upon check in after flying over from The U.S.  They also accommodated us for a late check out when I had the chance to play tennis on grass on our check out date and needed a quick shower.  Rooms and bathroom were kind of small, but it was close to The Sloan Station Tube stop, which we took daily to the matches.  Lots of great restaurants in the area and a fun, vibrant neighborhood of Belgravia."
May 2015,One of the finest!,"From the moment we got there 'till the moment we left, everything was amazing. The staff was very friendly and helpful, while the room was very well cleaned and neat. We also loved the food in the Pont St. We had a really nice stay there and we definitely recommend it!"
October 2015,My Home from Home,"Friendly, smiling, happy staff. Cool design. Youthful fun vibe. Quick and efficient service. Perfect pillows. Top location. Superb views from upper floors. Best cappuccino in London. Great food. I stay 20-30 nights a year at the Belgraves and see it as my home from home."
October 2015,Wonderful stay at Belgraves,"The staff was extremely welcoming and helpful. We felt right at home from the minute we walked up to the hotel. The room itself was beautiful, spacious and comfortable. We enjoyed coffee on the terrace one morning over the weekend - it's a small area, but well-designed and a nice space to start your morning."
October 2015,Fantastic Five Star Hotel,"I stayed at the Belgraves Hotel on the 3rd October 2015 for an overnight stay. As I arrived at the Hotel the staff were warm and friendly, helping me with my luggage from the taxi and taking it to my room. My bedroom was beautiful and the bathroom was fantastic. The food in the restaurant was wonderful with a good selection to choose from including the drinks. The Hotel is in a superb location for shops and restaurants. The staff at Hotel also helped to advise me on the best shops and where to go.  This was the best hotel I have ever been to and will be going back as soon as I can. Excellent Hotel and staff.       "
September 2015,2 day stay in king deluxe,"Fantastic hotel in perfect location for London visit.  Meandering around shops. Cycling on bikes along Thames and into Royal Parks and along Mall. Short taxi ride to theatre land .  Perfect room with beautiful bathroom and wonderful Belgravia views from the bath tub...  Food fantastic and staff amazing, caring and very attentive."
September 2015,"Great price, location and staff","The location was great.  Walked to Harrod's.  The staff were top notch!!  The room was spacious for central London.  We met friends and hung out in the bar upstairs which was comfortable, and pleasant.  Would stay again.              "
September 2015,BEWARE: This hotel does not honor on line reservations even when you prepay.,"IF you want certainty that you wont be bumped for a higher paying or more important guest then don't book this hotel.  I booked this hotel in April- 5 months in advance of my trip to England for the Rugby World Cup. I prepaid for 2 nights in April.  After I had already commenced travel, less than 24 hours before I was to check in I received a message saying they could not honor the reservation and I had to call the booking agent and book another hotel. when I asked why they were doing this after I paid 5 months ago the person said the hotel had just overbooked. There was no legitimate reason. So basically even though I could not change the booking or cancel it and had paid 5 months earlier they did not honor the contract. And of course at the last minute during fashion week and…"
September 2015,A modern whilst warm hotel,"Good location, in Grosvenor square, calm area, nice walks, cute restaurants and shops around. The staff is kind, always ready to provide service, in a very friendly atmosphere. The bed is really comfortable. Breakfast is good."
September 2015,Like a private home in Belgravia,"Staying at this property will make you feel as if you are on a much higher private estates property. It is truly nestled amongst some of SW1's most exquisite mansions.   Out of the 3 Thompson properties I have stayed at the Thompson Belgravia is a standout. The rooms are cozy with a good layout. Very comfortable. The amenities in the room have been well though of.   Room service was excellent as well. I ordered several items off of the menu and all were prepared as if one would do it at home.   What really stood out at this hotel was the staff. Everyone was always present, yet never around. I was always assisted--- intuitively. The staff was instinctive and helpful yet never annoying.   A great experience all a round: the Thompson Belgravia is my go to hotel now while I visit…"
September 2015,"Great staff, good location","Quite a chic hotel- little touches of London like the pinstriped bedcover and the Natasha Law art in the lobby (Jude Law's sister). Location is great and room style is pretty nice and modern. Bit let down by frankly rubbish lighting (no overhead ceiling lights) but they did offer an extra lamp if required. Staff were really sweet and helpful, good service. Nice gym, small but good with earphones provided. Garden view rooms are v nice"
October 2015,Amazing Afternoon Tea,"Fantastic afternoon tea at the Pont Street hotel. Every whim catered for. Great choice of teas. The service was amazing and the young waiter who served us was very friendly, nothing was too much trouble for him ... And he didn't laugh when we asked how to use the unusual tea strainer! If you want the best Afternoon Tea in London book here"
October 2015,Fantastic Hotel,"We have used this hotel for years, and since it has been re-furbished it is really special.  I cannot fault the Staff.  Beds are really comfortable and the rooms are a perfect size. Always a pleasure to stay at The Belgraves"
October 2015,Super Chic,We love the location & the plush rooms overlooking a leafy London  square. All the Belgraves team were great & made the atmosphere very en famille & dinner was exceptional! Have already booked in for our next London trip. 
October 2015,Great contemporary hotel,"I've stayed at the Belgraves more than 50 times now - yes, you guessed, I really rate it!  It's got   a great West End location' cool rooms, a buzzy bar, and brilliant staff; friendly attractive and always willing to go the extra mile."
October 2015,A great all round hotel!,"What an amazing hotel, the rooms are of very good size, very clean and service is impeccable. Starting off your day with a very well made breakfast or brunch at the Pont St place, the afternoon tea or drinks in the Cigar Lounge, and the fantastic burger served until after midnight for those who stay up late. Will be definitely visiting again!"
May 2015,Cant wait to stay there again!,"I stayed at Belgraves Hotel for 3 times .. and will stay there again next Dec for holiday season! Its a bouique hotel with elegant details and so cosy I stayed at Superior room which is smallest but yet great size even for 2 adults with all facilities you need! Wifi is fast, very clean room and service is amazing! the front desk staff and the concierge are so friendy and always smiling and willing to help! the special thing when I arrive they are waiting for me with a smile and they all know my name :) I also tried breakfast at room which was there on time requested and so delicious!  I usually visit London 2 to 3 times a year and would never stay anywhere else Xx"
October 2015,Extraordinary personalized service,I was referred to the Belgraves by a colleague who visits London often.  My experience was top notch. The contemporary refined interiors include an excellent restaurant. Rooms are comfortable with up to date amenities. There is a sincere effort at this hotel to insure guests feel at home. The concierge personnel are knowledgeable and persistent in pursuing guests requests. Most striking though is the personal attention provided by the staff. Upon departure I left a significant amount of cash in the room safe. The hotel notified me immediately and took measures to return the cash and a passport case expeditiously. I look forward to returning to Belgraves soon.
October 2015,Great service and good quality (for London!),"Overall, I've always had a good experience at this hotel.  The service is very attentive and personalised, which is surprisingly hard to find even at luxury hotels in London.  I also like that the employees are personable and professional without being arrogant or difficult.    The entire hotel is fairly new, and the rooms are crisp and modern.  The basic room is fairly small, but this is comparable to the average (high end hotel in London).  My only complaint is that the room is a bit dark (no overhead lighting).    The location is Belgravia/Knightbridge is exceptional!    I normally gravitate to ""chain"" hotels like Jumeriah, Hyatt ot Mandarin Oriental hotels (for the points or status), but London has become one city where I make an exception."
October 2015,Great experience ,Great rooms. Great service. Great location overall a very enjoyable stay and will definitely return next time I am visiting  Rooms had plenty of space. Very nicely decorated. Was even promoted to a suite on the top floor. Breakfast was also very good. Highly recommend the healthy choices. 
October 2015,Excellent central hotel,"Two night stay visiting London. Excellent staff who couldn't have been more friendly, great location for shopping and exploring the west side of London (ran both mornings around Green Park) and an excellent level of fit out (room, shower, bathroom etc). We had a room overlooking the road but the windows were very well insulated and it didn't disturb us at all. We didn't eat at the hotel (too many other options!!) so no comments on that side of things and the only slight niggle is that the mattress topper on the bed was uneven but once that was taken off all was fine. As a couple we would definitely stay there again on our next visit to London."
December 2015,"Tiny Rooms, Overpriced, Lobby Smells","Upon arriving at the Belgraves, a wall of dirty UK pub smell welcomes you.  After checking in, cram yourself into the two-person lift to get to your room.  Hopefully you, your suitcase, or your lift mate aren't overly large.  Discover that even the ""deluxe"" rooms are quite small.  Go to take a bath, and find there is no tub.  Explore various ways of opening a shower door that collides with the toilet when opening outward, or gets the hanging towels wet when opening inwards. Ponder the strange placement of small windows around the room.    Admire the relatively tasteful decor.  Enjoy the clean and comfortable bed, the free wifi and variety of TV stations.  Restaurant food was good, but service was terrible.  Apparently the bar and drinks are quite popular amongst locals.  In…"
December 2015,Amazing Stay - best in London so far,"Believe me when I tell you that this place is amazing. From the moment you walk it it's classy without being tacky, the staff is attentive and friendly without being over bearing and the room (and even hallways) are immaculate! Well done (and the a la carte breakfast is good too and so is the staff!)"
November 2015,"Great Location, amazing staff!","Great location, very comfortable bed, great breakfast, best front desk manager ever (apologies for not remembering the name but we checked in on 11/24/2015)! In London for business for a couple of days, upon check in we were immediately upgraded to a larger room which was, of course, much appreciated. Lovely view from the 8th floor, great dinner at Pont St. the in house restaurant (I had the lamb, delicious!) Overall very satisfying experience."
November 2015,Amazing hotel in Knightsbridge,"I stayed in the Belgrave last weekend with my husband, twin daughters and small dog.  The hotel is small enough to make every encounter with the exceptional staff personal.  The attention to detail is so thoughtful and considered.  Pont St the restaurant is just brilliant."
November 2015,"Great staff, location. Cool place.","Everything as great at this hotel. The concierge is very helpful and always ready to help with suggestions. Room service is excellent. Great location in Belgravia, close to Harrods. I like staying there every time I go to London."
November 2015,A shining example of quality,"My Mum and I visited London for a west end and tourist visit this weekend and I booked Belgraves with only the online knowledge from online.   When we arrived we was greeted by a helpful bell boy who immediately offered assistance with our luggage. We booked in and the staff on the desk were most polite friendly and helpful and explained what was available in the hotel for the stay.  We went to our room and was impressed with the room itself, it is a very modern lay out and the bathroom was beautiful. The beds were very comfortable and guests are truly not short of anything in their rooms. We requested complimentary hot drinks and kettle and the staff had them up with a selection of choices on the tray. Nice touches like the Molten Brown complimentary gifts is a nice idea also. …"
November 2015,Beautiful hotel,"Great location , great views from room, furnishings and finish to room were perfection .  Hotel restaurant was lovely and waiting on staff were great .  Concierge was very friendly but reception staff could have been more friendly ."
November 2015,Afternoon Tea,"Indulged ourselves on the Marie Anotoinette Afternoon Tea. Excellent food & they were happy to keep refilling our tea pots, especialy good with all the cakes. V polite staff. Even a doggie bag to take home what we'd not managed to finish. Will def. recommend as a special treat 😊"
November 2015,Now it feels like home...a must visit!,Visited the hotel for 2 nights in November and another 2 nights in September. The hotel is a must stay even for business travellers. The moment you walk into the front door you can feel the vibe and the friendliness of the staff. I must admit am a fan of the high-floor rooms for their stunning views of London (tip: remember to take a photo at night!). The rooms are cosy with excellent beds and very stylish decoration (thank god no carpets on the floors!).  Once again the tip from my side is: visit the Terrace especially those of us who wish to enjoy a cigar!  Highly recommended  P.S. Dear Belgraves staff: you will see me again and again
October 2015,5 Stars!,My wife and I stayed at Belgraves last week. We loved every minute of it. We arrived by car and the Door staff swiftly greeted us and made us feel welcome. The car was valeted parked and we were introduced by name to the receptionist. The room was ready and the luggage came straight up. The room was modern and funky and very luxurious.  Ben the Concierge sorted out all our arrangements with ease and we were made to feel at home by all staff we encountered. The staff recognised us by name throughout our stay which makes a real difference! We will definitely return in the near future. Such a cool place.  
August 2015,One week stay,"Very well located. The concierge is Brazilian (Diego), very friendly and helpfull. Free wi fi for the guests and it works fast. Comfy room and very clean. Good choice near sloane square. The terrace is a very Nice place. Breakfast was not included in our rate but the price is ok."
August 2015,Excellent Customer Service......,"As ever, a lovely room with a stunning view over the park. Customer service was great and all the staff were super friendly, efficient and very kind. Right in the heart of London, you would struggle to find a better hotel."
August 2015,Luxury,"I honestly can't recommend this hotel highly enough. My wife and I spent four nights and five days in London for my wife's 30th birthday, staying at this hotel in the heart of Belgravia.  The hotel was immaculate and the service was better than excellent. The staff couldn't be more welcoming or hospitable, they literally couldn't do enough for us!  There was complimentary drinks on arrival and they had a large chocolate brownie cake with 'happy birthday' scribed on it sent to the room.  We dined in the restaurant before getting a cab to the Queens theatre to see Les Miserables and the food and wine was delicious. Again, the restaurant staff were attentive and very welcoming.  We used the bar several times after a long days sightseeing and the beer was served perfectly chilled.…"
February 2015,it was very beautiful hotel.,"The rooms were so clean and so nice . staffs were very friendly and smile.it was not so far from the town.the price was not so expensive .if i have a free time ,i will go back to stay here again.and ,i think that,many people like it."
August 2015,"Excellent hotel, Brilliant customer service","I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and it was lovely, the rooms were clean and the views were amazing. I highly recommend the restaurant as well as they have brilliant customer service and the food is delicious."
July 2015,Nice hotel but service could be better,"The property is new and modern.  Rooms are a tad small (we booked a suite which is actually just a bigger room, with no separate sitting area).  Great location.  We were a bit let down by the service - some of the desk/ concierge staff did not appear to be very familiar with nearby places/ transportation.  We left something behind and when we emailed them 3/4 days later, they quickly responded saying that yes, some items have been found in the room.  Happy with the quick response, but it would have been better if they took the initiative to email us.  There was no breakdown of what had been left in the room.  Surprised to find that close to 130 pounds had been charged to my credit card for shipping without first notifying me of the shipping costs - what we left behind was a…"
July 2015,Mr Apolo vieira,I'd been there for my first time last July with my family. The staff was friendly and kind. Accommodations are good and localization is very convenient and charming as the hotel at all. I'd truly recommend the stay in this cozy place as a great refuge from the london's skyscrapers.
July 2015,"Great service, nice room and decent neighbourhood","We stayed in the hotel for 5 days. First the staff were helpful and provided great service from the moment we stepped in the room, and helpful with our enquires. The room is clean and tidy with some view at the higher floor. The location is a bit far from tube but is within walking distance to Sloane square/ Knight bridge/ Victoria. Pretty close to the high end fashion shops and Harrod's. The neighborhood is quiet and safe, and is actually quite near to foreign embassies. And it is also close to a little street with some pretty cool restaurants.   The bed is comfortable but the variety of pillow choices was limited, couldn't find a softer pillow during my stay."
July 2015,A lovely boutique hotel w/ very nice staff,We were resident for a week. There is no fault w/ the hotel. The staff is very nice and attentive. The breakfast is perfect. The rooms while a bit tight are well appointed and provide all one might seek. My only note is that one does have to walk at least 10 minutes to Knightsbridge and 20 minutes to Sloan Square. But a small price to pay for such nice company. We shall return.
July 2015,Outstanding service and great location,"The service extended to me by the Belgraves staff, in particular the front office management team of Parvez and Renata, was second to none. They went above and beyond their duties to ensure my stay was luxurious and hassle free.  The high service level and quality of the room gave the impression of a large 5-star luxury hotel but at half the price.  Would definitely return."
May 2015,"Nice design, friendly service, great location.","We spent two weekends at Belgraves in just over a month and really loved our experience. This is slowly becoming our favourite place in London!  Staff is very friendly, rooms are nicely designed (loved the bathroom) and location is excellent, especially if you want to be in the Sloane Street/Belgravia/South Kensington area  During our second stay we had a room with view on the square which we preferred to the room we had during our first stay (at the back of the hotel, hardly any view and smaller). But I guess this is linked to the type of room we booked.  They also have a very good bar by the way, ideal for pre-dinner drinks or a nightcap.   We will certainly return.   "
June 2015,Perfect spot for our Wimbleton experience!!,Wonderful setting and service!  The staff is excellent ! They were all so willing to make our stay exceptional! The concierge service was exceptional! Diego and Violetia were the most helpful! Thank you for making our stay wonderful! Georgia Enright               
July 2015,Birthday treat and overdue break !,"5 star perfection in a gorgeous boutique hotel. The staff go out of their way to make you feel special and we instantly felt ""at home"".   The little added extras they put in really make a big difference! The rooms are stunning and we had the best nights sleep ever.  The bar had a great ambience,  burgers were amazing and the staff were friendly and attentive.   Breakfast really was fabulous and made even better with the service from Bryan the restaurant supervisor.   All the staff are happy and friendly & seem genuinely passionate about the service they provide -Anita & Laura stood out for us.   Highly recommend this hotel and can't wait to return!"
July 2015,Belgraves Thompson,"Beautiful modern boutique hotel. Great use of space in room. Can tell it was very thought out. Location good. Very nice wine and cheese hour from 6 to 7. Loved all the little ""extras"". Pricey, but I think Wimbledon made all  the rooms expensive."
July 2015,Visit to Belgraves,"I recently visited the Belgraves, during a short London business trip.  The hotel was an excellent choice, clean, well run and well managed.  I particularly pleased to have a room waiting after a night flight from the states.  The rooms were small, but clean, well appointed and remarkably quiet.  The staff was helpful and friendly.  The bar was an excellent choice for a pre-dinner drink and snack."
July 2015,Fantastic service ,Amazing service! Especially Niko!!! So much so I have to write about it!! The staff here are five star !! We have had the best time and the breakfast really is fabulous!!! We love it here!! We live next door and breakfast here all the time!!! The choice is excellent! 
June 2015,Best hotel in London,"I have stayed in many hotels in London. This was by far the best. We wanted to stay reasonably close to Hyde Park as we had tickets to BST... This did not disappoint. It was a short, pleasant walk to the park. In close proximity was Harrods, Harvey Nicholls and other designer shops. We were also in close proximity to several tube stations making it easy to get around to see the main sights in London. As for the actual hotel, our room was lovely. It was clean and well presented. It was quiet and comfortable. We tried room service, the burgers were the best we've ever had! Service and staff was outstanding. We were overwhelmed by the staff, they were friendly and could not do enough for you. Excellent customer service! The restaurant was also a pleasant experience. The quality of…"
July 2015,Fantastic experience!,The Belgraves is a smaller personalised Four Seasons experience.  The staff is exceptional.  The service is flawless.  They anticipate your needs before you can even verbalise them.  The location is prime.  It's a quick walk to Hyde Park and the local shops are upscale and easy to access as well as the many delicious restaurants.  
July 2015,Excellent in every aspect,"From the excellent location in Belgravia, to the chic contemporary yet comfortable rooms this definitely somewhere I will return to. Friendly helpful staff make this a very welcoming place.  Rooms overlooking Chesham Place have a view of the small park. Just a 10 minute stroll to Sloane Squareand Kings Rd in one direction and the same in the other direction to Harrids and Brompton Rd. Eas walking to Hyde Park.  Loved it. "
June 2015,"Comfortable, stylish, nice location","After a long week of business travel, I spent two nights at Belgraves on my own dime, extending my stay in London. Overall, my experience was very good. I would return to this hotel.  Location: Excellent, if you like to be away from the craziness, but within short walking distance of tube stations and major tourist sites. I discovered too late, but there is a small grocery store (Waitrose) two blocks away which is very convenient for snacks and beverages.   Room: Excellent. Stylish and comfortable, even if a little bit small. I had a room on the 10th floor sharing a wall with the elevator which I thought would be a problem, but it wasn't at all. The window opened and air conditioning kept things very comfortable.  Food: Excellent. Expensive, but isn't all of London?  Service:…"
May 2015,"Amazing, first class!!","Impeccable, warm, and friendly service. Beautiful, posh setting in the ultra-luxury of Knightsbridge. Everyone treated us so well, we felt totally pampered. One example of their ""above-and-beyond"" service: I am pregnant, so when my husband and I went to their very nicely appointed complimentary wine and cheese hour, I asked if any of the cheeses were pasteurized. The hostess immediately went to the kitchen to inquire, and came back with a completely separate, beautifully made platter of pasteurized cheeses just for me! It was such a lovely gesture. First class all around!"
May 2015,Best hotel we have ever stayed at!!!,"Absolutely loved this hotel. From the minute we arrived, it was simply perfect. The room was beautiful and the surprise birthday cake and champagne was a very nice touch! Staff all incredibly friendly, and couldn't do enough for you. We will 100% be back!!! Also lovely bar and restaurant which we spent some time in."
April 2015,Wonderful place to stay!,"We spent 9 nights at the Belgraves.  It is a moderately priced hotel (for London).  The Belgraves is in a stunning neighborhood, within walking distance of public transportation, and has extremely helpful staff.   Our room was perfect. The hotel is in a quiet location, so traffic and street noise did not disturb us. The concierge helped us plan our daily itinerary; they made reservations, ordered a few tickets, and explained how to use the subway. With their assistance, we saw London on our own. We ate once in the restaurant; the food was very good.  Breakfast was not included in our room rate; we found a wonderful local restaurant (Patisserie Valerie) which was located just a few blocks away. The Belgraves does have some exercise equipment which is well maintained. We will…"
May 2015,Very friendly,"it was our first time and for sure we will visit the hotel again .  The stuf have a very nice vibe , they are very friendly .  I wish all hotels are like this . The room are very clean .  My kids love the place .it is a unic hotel .               "
April 2015,excellent lastminute booking,"Its usually pot luck when making a last minute booking, but this was a real treat. Excellent hotel, beautifully and very stylishly appointed, very attentive and polite staff, great room with excellent shower and view over the little green space at the crossroads. Not close to any tube stations but set in a quietish location. Would thoroughly recommend it."
May 2015,"Great hotel, very friendly staff",The hotel has a very nice style and the staff is very friendly and helpful. It is located in a lovely neighbourhood. Good value for money in London. I will definitely come back next time I'm in London
April 2015,Nice nights stay,"Stayed overnight whilst eating at Heston's ""Dinner"" about 1/2 mile away. Friendly check in staff, clean room, great location, nice continental style breakfast. quickly and efficiently resolved minor issues. Free parking overnight outside on the Sunday night we stayed! Would go again."
April 2015,Home Away From Home,"Just returned from another week at Belgraves in London. Whether it was being greeted by name by Riccardo when we got out of our car upon arrival, or the personal attention by all members of staff, we are always made to feel welcome and important when we are there.  The Concierge staff, Ben (Head Conceirge), Violetta and Diego, were extremely helpful and took care of all our needs with efficiency and a smile.  Our suite was spaciious, comfortable, clean and ready for us upon arrival. Décor is modern and cool.  We enjoy the area around Belgraves which is quiet for central London. We will return to Belgraves whenever we are in London."
March 2015,Outstanding!.... Expensive but outstanding!,"I took myself, my Mrs, Mum and Dad up to Belgraves for a surprise 60th Birthday Trip for my Mum. She'd always wanted to stay in a 5 star London hotel, so that's what we did!  Everything about this hotel was magnificent. The service from the moment we got to the hotel was perfection. So helpful and friendly, willing to literally do anything for you.  We were given a complimentary room upgrade due to it being my Mum's special birthday (both rooms upgraded!). The rooms were magnificent. Had everything you could ever possibly want in a hotel room but I wasn't really that surprised. I've stayed in quite a few 5 star hotel around the world so know generally what to expect and this one is one of the better, more 5 star worthy hotels! The bathroom was really nice and had a fantastic…"
April 2015,Beautiful hotel in a great location with very friendly and approcable staff.,"This hotel is located in the heart of Knightsbridge but isn't the least bit stuffy! Décor is gorgeous - very modern with interesting art scattered about. Room (King Size Deluxe) was a good size and as we'd requested an upper floor we had a good view (although it was a very windy day and there was a bit of noise from that). Bathroom was fabulous - bath big enough for 2 and loo screened off. Nice Ren toiletries were a bonus. Bar was very relaxed and a nice spot to while away an hour or meet up with friends. Special mention to the staff who were all - from reception to the bar staff, friendly, helpful but most of all very approachable."
May 2015,Great location ,Staff in general are very helpful. The atmosphere is relaxed and we felt very comfortable. However the overall experience was spoilt by a few things.   There was a party on the terrace which our room overlooked which dictated when we went to bed due to the noise. We sought refuge in the bar which wasn't a bad thing. The barman was great and mixes great cocktails!   The hotel is very warm and in the night we felt stifled so had to put on the air con which was really loud and meant we couldn't sleep. We had to turn it off and resorted to opening the window but the blackout blind kept banging and again meant we couldn't sleep.   In the morning we ordered a couple of coffees but these took almost an hour to arrive. We had to call housekeeping for shower gel and shampoo as they…
May 2015,Drinks reception,Pleasantly greeted at the hotel by two very helpful doormen who guided me towards my friends in the mezzanine lounge!  Very attentive staff on hand with drinks and delicious canapes. The manager of the hotel gave us a guided tour of the hotel which was very impressive. A small intimate hotel in a great location of London.
May 2015,Friend's reception,"had a wonderful cocktail rendezvous in mezzanine area.  Service was excellent, very professional. Unique ambiance and very cozy, with adequate seating.  Location in quiet part of Belgravia. Wonderful canapés too!"
May 2015,Always there,"This small hotel employs enough friendly well trained staff to enable them to always be available for service. eg if one came to the front foyer to sit down for a minute or two someone would after about 4/5 minutes politely ask if one would like a drink, cup of tea etc. Attentive without being pushy"
May 2015,Delightful retreat in good location.,"This was a last minute booking via a booking website, it was a smallish hotel in a good location  at a great price that included breakfast. On arrival the staff were all very friendly and most helpful, a late night coffee in the bar was made an experience by the staff. Our room although small was beautifully decorated and well appointed and very quiet, the views across London were amazing too. The only reason I did not award 5 stars was because our rate included breakfast, on arrive we were reminded of that and shown where the restaurant was and told breakfast times including those for  room service. We selected room service which was good but on checking out were charged for breakfast because we were told the breakfast included was only the continental, I pointed out the items…"
March 2015,Excellent Client Care in a lovely comtemporary environment,"Great boutique style hotel in a handy location. Service was excellent and a small issue with regard to the room was dealt with in a quick and courteous manner. Not everything can be 100% right in every hotel but the measure of a good hotel is how any issues are dealt with and hats off to the Belgraves, they got it very right. Would definitely return."
May 2015,A great find in a great area. ,"The room was jus a bit cozy, everything else was perfect.  The staff if friendly to very helpful.  Our breakfast was included in our room rate and was outstanding. Both quality of food and service. The location is convenient to a number of neighboring restaurants and parks.  Would recommend and would visit again.   "
May 2015,Fantasic Hotel with Brilliant Staff,"I frequently stay at the Belgraves Hotel when I visit London, in fact it is now the only hotel I will stay at because the hotel is so good, a fantastic location, excellent staff, beautiful rooms and the food is also excellent. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. It is  hidden gem with many gems working there! "
May 2015,"Lovely hotel, great location","This hotel is stunning, well decorated, smells fantastic, the service is great, the rooms are beautiful the bathroom modern and comfortable... I travel for business so this was a really good choice. Great fitness facilities too."
May 2015,Bar Review More So Than Hotel Review,"A top quality bar with cigar terrace, huge bar food selection and quality, well-priced drinks. A range of champagnes by the glass and by the bottle with reasonably-priced bar snacks and meals. I mean, ice cream sandwiches. Yes please!  The cigar selection isn't as vast as I would have hoped, like at the Bvlgari hotel, but the terrace is very nice in good weather and heated in bad.  Altogether, a fine establishment that I fully intend to return to."
September 2015,Warm welcomes and human staff,"The Belgraves is the most warm, helpful and genuinely kind hotel I have ever experienced. The staff are superb, the decor modern, but not minimalistic.  A quiet, sophisticated haven, where you are spoiled in an adult manner, yet with playful hints, like cookies at bedtime (delicious).  I felt I belonged there, and that I was wanted there. A rare treat in a technolical world."
September 2015,"Gorgeous rooms, stellar service","Stayed there twice within 2 weeks (total of 4 nights).  Very quiet, luxurious rooms, great concierge & support staff.  The second time I was there, 4 of my friends also stayed at the hotel.  We all enjoyed the stay, which came after hiking across Scotland, so the pampering was sorely needed!  The hotel serves a very comprehensive  continental breakfast with coffee/tea/cappuccino included, in their restaurant on the first floor (try to get one of the comfy benches by the windows.)  Very good wine & cheese tasting for guests from 6-7 one night, and also great hot chocolate & drinks in their upstairs lounge/bar.  Beds are super comfortable & pillows are just right (not overstuffed, but not too flat either).  Hotel is in a great location (probably safe to walk around at night alone)…"
September 2015,Nice Hotel and Great Location,The manager upgraded my room to a suite due to minor issue with the TV during last stay here in June.  The room is beauty with great view.   The bathroom is amazing.  Love the tub and the rain shower!  I did not give it a 5-star because I couldn't find electrical outlet to plug the hair dryer to in the bathroom.    The hotel has a great bar as well.  A place to chill after sightseeing or work.
September 2015,"Superb staff, great hotel","Everyone I interacted with at this hotel was smart, friendly, helpful and well turned out. Everything just worked. Good location, in the middle of Belgravia. On-site food was also very good. No fuss, just a great overall experience.                 "
August 2015,Esther,"Perfect location in a very quite square, walking distance to London best shopping areas. My room located on the 3rd floor had the perfect view towards the trees, loved the bathroom. The staff could not have been more helpful! My hotel choice for my next trip to London."
September 2015,Very good hotel,"I stayed here for 6 weeks, within that time I was obviously able to pick all the pros and cons...   Pros, staff are super friendly and helpful, the rooms are great and the bed is super comfortable, the food available in the restaurant is great and the room service is efficient. Depending what room you get, you may get a good view of Knightsbridge.   Cons, it's too expensive, not quite 5* for me and charges that price, especially the food/drink, as nice as it is, £8 for a coffee, just no. They also lost a colleague of mines work suit (rectified by a room upgrade, none the less it shouldn't happen).   Overall, very good and I would stay here again for business and pleasure. "
August 2015,Perfect 5 star,"Stayed at the end of Augast. Perfect in every thing,vary friendly staff,perfect location max of 10 min walk to Harrods.  Many restaurants and coffee shops around.  A big supermarket few steps away. Would recommend this hotel  "
August 2015,A gem,"A gem of a hotel. Tucked away in a quiet part of Belgravia. Superb service from all staff, nothing was too much trouble & always followed up. The food was superb & the location is brilliant for Sloane Street / Harrods the V&A etc                                   "
August 2015,A London Gem,"We stayed here for the first three nights of our trip to London in August and it was great. We couldn't find fault with a single thing during our stay. In fact, we enjoyed it so much that we booked the hotel for another night upon our return to London from the South just before flying out. It's got great interior, SUPER comfy beds and really friendly staff. The rooms are on the smaller side, but that's London for you. The bar is very nice for an afternoon/early evening cocktail before hitting the city for dinner, and the location is great if you're looking to be in the Knightsbridge/Kings Road areas."
August 2015,Excellent,"An excellent boutique hotel, well positioned, good food. service of the highest ever experienced. It looks like  service is the hotel flagship: a misunderstanding whether price included breakfast, was sorted out in no time, though I had no written proof. I will certainly stay again next time i'm in London."
June 2015,Warren Makes It Worth Your Money,"There are great hotel managers, and terrible ones.  Warren at Belgraves made it his personal mission to see that our family of 4 (here for business), requiring  2 rooms, would be comfortable for a 2 week stay. While our teenagers had to move rooms more than once, as space is very limited during events in London in June, Warren never made us feel petty about our preference for the kids to have two beds.  Further, he and all of the Belgraves staff were as family from Day 1 -- arranging great dentists for an emergency procedure; a lawyer/notary to close some US business, all the while we slept on the finest comfortable beds with luxury surrounds.  THEN..we were faced with a different Belgraves face -- one individual who not only was unpleasant, but insisted when our sons move rooms…"
June 2015,A great hotel,"My wife booked as a surprise for my 30th birthday and we had a lovely stay. Right from the outset the staff were very kind and friendly and took care of my wife who was 7 months pregnant. They upgraded our room and had a little birthday cake suprise for me as well.   The hotel is clean, smart and just the right size so they don't lose the personal touch. The room was great; very comfortable and smart.  It's in a fantastic location which is walking distance of most attractions, shops, bars etc and quiet enough so you can escape some of the hustle and bustle.   We only stayed for one night over a weekend but would definatly stay again and recommend to others.  The only thing we didnt make use of was the bar/restaurant because we had reservations booked elsewhere but it looked…"
June 2015,Wonderful stay,"I stayed at belgraves for four days, the staff is lovely and helpful. The area is quiet and homy but still close to all the right places. Breakfast is very nice and fresh. You will not regret your stay!              "
June 2015,Hotel was awesome,This hotel was awesome and perfect for business travel.  The rooms where very clean and comfortable.  The hotel restaurant was also delicious!  I really enjoyed my stay and will book here again when I return to London for business.
May 2015,Great hotel in the heart of Belgravia,"All the staff was very helpful and polite, the room was impecable and well design. The location is great and convenient. The tube is only minutes walking and there are plenty of nice restaurants around it I will stay here again for sure!       "
June 2015,An amazing experince in London,For the past years Ive always stayed in the same hotel in London but this time I decided to make a change and take a friends advice to trying the belgraves hotel especially that it's in the area where u prefer to stay. I stated for one night only but I can say it was one of my best experiences the hotel staff was professional and friendly and the room was very clean with good furniture. I would definitely stay in the belgraves for my next visit
June 2015,Chic Hotel located in beautiful Belgravia,"We chose this hotel because we had a great experience staying at a Thompson Hotel in New York... The Belgraves by Thompson is a sexy and stylish hotel with some New York edginess. The staff were outstanding - very friendly and accommodating. The rooms were beautiful and well appointed. The bar on level 1 was a great spot to enjoy a drink and relax. The location was great - very close to Harrods, Harvey Nicks Knightsbridge and the tube stations. Belgravia is a very expensive part of London, every second car is a Ferrari or Bentley. There are some great restaurants and gastro pubs close by. We would fully recommend this hotel. "
June 2015,Worth a Visit,This is a boutique hotel and I stayed here overnight with my daughter and son in law as a birthday gift.  The staff on learning it was my birthday provided small cakes in my room to share.  The location is perfect for walking - within a ten minute walk of Hyde Park and less than half an hour to Oxford Street.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  The rooms were well appointed and had everything needed for a comfortable stay. Air condition worked perfectly and I had a great view over the city. Excellent full English breakfast with delicious coffee.
May 2015,Rate incl breakfast but ...,"Found a great last minute deal, which included breakfast. But no one explained that it only included continental breakfast, even though we chose cheaper items from the menu we were charged for them which I found really annoying. That is the reason I am not rating this Hotel excellent, everything was - great room, super staff.               "
May 2015,Loved it,Stayed with mum For Chelsea flower show and business trip. Perfect location walkable to everywhere in Chelsea and Knightsbridge. Lovely front desk service was checked into the room early. Neat sized room but perfectly designed to accommodate a velvet sofabed and kingsize bed with privacy for both of us. Ate out nearby but the breakfast service was so friendly and warm and the best coffee ever. They forgot to offer us champagne as part of our package but it was just an oversight. I'll be planning another stay here soon I hope
January 2015,stylish hotel in great location,"had a great stay! very stylish interior, rooms are not oversized but ok, great service throughout the place, perfect location for business and shopping and a very good hotel bar. I really enjoyed my visit!"
November 2014,Great Hotel- Great Service,"This review is for a stay a couple of months ago, that I had with my boyfriend but I just wanted to write a review due to the absolutely exceptional service we received- free upgrade, room was spacious and luxurious- We couldn't have asked for more. The hotel concierge service, bar and staff were friendly and professional. No complaints.   Thank you very much- We will hopefully be back and will recommend to friends."
December 2014,Great little boutique,"Great location tucked away in a beautiful neighborhood. I like the fact that it's not in a hotel zone and it's a few short blocks from Harrod's. Our room was on the small side but hey, it's London, with the bathroom being above average. We didn't have any view to speak of, we overlooked some mechanical units on a roof-top but I still liked the over-all vibe of the hotel. The bar area on the second floor was great to come back to for a nite-cap. I would definitely recommend this hotel, great value for the price."
December 2014,Torn between giving it 3 or 4 stars...,"I travel to London regularly and always like to stay at different hotels to explore new areas. The Belgraves is located between posh Sloane Square and Knightsbridge, a very pretty and residential area with plenty of high-end shopping opportunities. It was certainly nice to see what the streets of Belgravia are like but it wasn’t exactly our cup of tea for a 4-night stay. We found that there was a lack of restaurants, cafés and breakfast opportunities around. Of course you’re walking distance from Heston Blumenthal’s dinner, Gordon Ramsay or Petrus but it’s not like we can afford to dine at Michelin-starred restaurants 4 nights in a row. I guess this was sort of expected though, so we weren’t disappointed about the location. However, next time we would choose a more lively area…"
December 2014,Good value,"Well situated and a short walk from knightsbridge high street, it's a typical Thompson hotel. Small and well decorated. We had a room on the 2nd floor which wasn't great as it looked onto the hotel roof scattered with Air-conditioning equipment but it was not really an issue as we didn't spend much time there. The bathroom is small but does have an excellent rain forest shower. Worth a stay for a quick in and out of London."
December 2014,"Great hotel, great location",Stay in Knightsbridge several times a year and have tried most of the hotels here.  Really impressed with Belgraves.  Understated but impeccable service and excellent rooms / amenities.   Let me check in early following an early arrival from the U.S. as well without any drama.
November 2014,Absolutley bang on,"This hotel is in the heart of Knightsbridge - it comes with a certain price and a certain expectation.  When we get over the cost (this is not a cheap hotel) then we can really enjoy all that it has to offer. From our arrival, screeching to a halt at the main entrance - the valet took away the car, the concierge took away our luggage, and we were checked in swiftly and efficiently.   The hotel is immaculate, the rooms are immaculate and the bathroom/wet room is to die for.  We only stayed one night - a dirty weekend in the capital.  But oh-my-days, it was worth it.   If you are looking for a top-end facility, then I urge you to book a stay here."
November 2014,A fantastic find- will be back,"My friend and I spent 3 nights here on a shopping trip to London. The location was perfect and the hotel was also perfect, from the lovely staff to the great food and drink and the smoking terrace. Could not have asked for a better place, so nice to stay in a smaller more cosy and friendly hotel compared to some of the larger ones we have stayed in the past. Look forward to our next stay."
December 2014,A great hotel with a good location,"This was a lovely hotel that a friend and I stayed at this month. It is very clean and the staff are helpful, friendly and attentive.  The rooms are a good size (we were given a handicap accessible room), so I can't comment on a typical room.  Except for spotty wifi service throughout the hotel (at no extra charge), I really enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay there again. The location is nice and quiet, midway between the Knightsbridge and Sloan Square stations (each is a 7-10 minute walk).  Many bus lines are a couple blocks away on the main road, but we didn't try to use them.  We used the concierge sevhce to book a day trip to Stonehenge and were very pleased. "
December 2014,Fantastic,"I took my wife to the Belgraves Hotel for our first anniversary, a fact I mentioned to the lady in reservations when booking. Upon arriving at the hotel we were congratulated on our anniversary and upgraded to the Penthouse Suite. To say we were blown away with the room would be an understatement. We had a separate living room with views over London (London Eye, Big Ben, the Shard etc) two bathrooms (one of which had the most marvellous shower I have ever seen) and a bedroom with a massive and comfortable bed and access to the balcony.   A bottle of champagne was brought up to our room (which was included with the promotion we booked) but also included was a card congratulating us on our anniversary which was very thoughtful.   The hotel itself is very cool, not at all stuffy.…"
March 2015,Great staff and service,"Great location close to shopping on Sloane street. No excess luxury, the room was a little dark, the mattress could have been softer, and my bathtowel had a big hole in it. But the room was clean and comfortable enough, and we enjoyed our stay. Were upgraded to a Premium room, so avoided the glass wall between shower and bed (which is a stupid trend, I think). They made our bed twice a day, and we had fresh towels every time we returned. The best feature of this hotel is the top notch service throughout. Everyone very friendly, helpful and efficient. Did not have dinner at the hotel, but lunch, snacks and cocktails were very tasty. The breakfast was simple but good. Superfresh croissants. Would definitely stay again."
February 2015,Trendy laid back sophistication,"I've just got back from spending 3 nights at this wonderfully eclectic hotel. From the moment of arriving I felt welcome, fortunately my King Premium room was ready, lucky as my flight into London arrived at 7am. A stunning room with view over the park, everything was just right, free wifi, delightful blue LED lights in bathroom for night lights, REN toiletries and one of the most comfortable beds with proper pillows. The terrace is stunning, done in diiferent shades of grey with walls of green ivy, perfect for that glass of Savignon Blanc to meet friends after shopping at nearby Harrods, Harvey Nic's and Sloane Street. Each and every member of staff were so friendly, it felt more like being ""at home in London"" This is definetly a place to stay! Many thanks to all of you!"
February 2015,"First class service, design and comfort","My stay at the Belgraves was a unique one but I think illustrates the wonderful nature of the hotel well. I flew to London to propose to my girlfriend. Although she lives in London, the proposal was a surprise, so I needed somewhere else to stay while I hatched my plans. Not knowing any better, I picked the Belgraves based primarily on location - it was convenient to my planned venue. Looking back, it's clear that I stumbled onto a gem.   Firstly, I arrived at the hotel off an economy class red-eye at 8am, fully expecting to have to hang out in the (beautiful) lobby until a more reasonable check-in time. Nonsense - they had a room ready and happily checked me into it. Even in a nice hotel (with rooms available), 8am check-in is a stretch, and it was much appreciated. Next, the…"
February 2015,Fab staff,We spent 3 nights here recently and what fantastic staff after only just arriving from the door people to reception everyone spoke to us and after that they remembered us and our names which is a bonus in such a grand city. Joy I have to say. The room was very nice and modern but there were a couple of issues the main one was the shower which itself was great but the back if the glass shower faced the bed and only had a beaded curtain by the bed but you could see straight through and although I was with my husband just sometimes it's nice for a bit of privacy and we don't all want to show our bits to all so I couldn't understand why the hotel chose a beaded curtain they could have used plenty of other types if material as it was only a body width away from the bed. The other…
February 2015,Fantastic everytime!,"This is by far my husband and my favourite hotel to stay in London. On checking in this time we really didn't like our room which is a first here, but after a quick phone call to reception, our room was changed no problem! One of the reasons we love coming here is because you feel like you have been transported to a cool boutique hotel in New York, the decor is soooo cool! The bar is great for pre dinner and post dinner cocktails-the bar tenders are fantastic! The newly refurbished restaurant looks fabulous but unfortunately we had plans somewhere else with friends, but will definitely be trying it next time! All the staff are friendly but professional and nothing is too much hassle. We totally recommend this hotel to anybody! Thank you again Belgraves for another Great stay!"
December 2014,Lovely hotel and location,"We stayed here for two nights, including NYE. We had a corner king room that was quite large for London standards. Very comfortable bed, wonderfully large bathroom with walk in shower and soaking tub. We were able to make use of the amenities: fitness centre is kitted out with the right equipment, bar area is comfortable and modern, and the breakfast is fab.  Location is great. Short walk to Sloane St and the bus. Great restaurants/pubs a short walk to Elizabeth Street.   The staff were all so helpful and friendly. Special shout out to the our server in the restaurant who was so excited we were going to her previous place of employment for dinner that she made sure to let them know we were her guests and to take good care of us. Also to the concierge who attempted to post a gift…"
February 2015,Good find. A keeper,"Was very pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this small boutique hotel in Belgravia. A stones throw away from Knightsbridge and walking distance to Sloan Square and transportation this is more than comfortable place to pitch your tent. Rooms tend to small but so what? Who spends their time in the room in London. Service was great, lobby attendants gracious, desk efficient and restaurant staff very nice with great service. Decor is beautiful and I loved the 2nd floor lounge and bar. And Neville (sp?) - best bartender in London. I will be back. Cheers!"
February 2015,"Posh area, can be improved","Located in very posh belgravia right beside knightsbridge , consulates etc...rooms are modern clean and nice enough...mattress is awesome for my taste in firmness.  Couple improvements in my opinion:  1. Don't stay in 9-block rooms (mine was 209) as its right beside housekeeping service access and you will get constant noise , banging etc early in the morning  2. Pillows are very very thin and not firm at all -- big gripe for me despite them showing foam pillows in their pillow menu..."
February 2015,Fantastic,"We stayed here for valentines weekend, it was wonderful from the minute we were greated at the door, the staff are all smiles and can't do enough to help , warm welcoming and the hotel is beautiful in a lovely location, perfect and will be booking again👍"
February 2015,Fantastic,"My partner and I had such a fantastic stay here. At every opportunity the staff were extremely helpful and made everything very easy, from taking our bags to our room or flagging us a taxi when we left. The room itself was great, particularity the shower - a huge head ensured a luxury wash! "
March 2015,Bringing in london some piece of NYC,This hotel over met my expectations. I've been at the Miami one so I had some ideas on what to expect (less nice :-)) but the london one is super cool! Bar and the restaurant are very nice - but food is english only (not my favorite one). Rooms are not too big but still very comfortable. Not giving 5 stars because the open wifi (only option available) was too slow. Will definitely come back !
March 2015,"Great staff, relaxing stay!","Spent 5 nights at the hotel for a quick break from 27 March-1 April. Room was beautiful as usual - the hotel managed to give me my preferred room as I had wanted to stay in the room I stayed in previously. The staff was excellent as well. Everyone was friendly and warm and it was really nice to experience that, especially as I was travelling solo. My first morning, I overslept and missed by in-room breakfast order, but was offered breakfast at a later time once I woke up and the staff was very understanding. Also, the concierge managed to get me tickets to the sold out Alexander McQueen exhibition on short notice, which I appreciated.  The location is great, the hotel is comfortable and contemporary, and the staff is amazing. I really enjoyed my time here and look forward to…"
December 2014,Enjoyable Stay,This is a belated review of a short stay over the New Year. I booked 3 rooms via Lastminute and had a brief delay at check in when the hotel had only allocated 1 room. However this was quickly dealt with by check in staff and overall we had a pleasant stay at this stylish hotel. The location is excellent - a short walk to Harrods and Sloane Street and it suited us perfectly. Service in the bar could be better but perhaps we were just unlucky. Would stay again.
December 2014,Another great stay at belgraves,"I had the pleasure to stay again at belgraves, the team are all so helpful and it has a great relaxed vibe, the rooms are really Modern, spotlessly clean and really could not ask for any more from a london hotel, the turn down service was perfect leaving ice and bottled water for my return and the restaurant in the hotel is also very nice. Hope to stay again soon, thank you "
November 2014,Modern boutique hotel ,"This hotel is where the trendy people in London meet for a drink. The food menu in the bar area is generally good as well as their drinks. The hotel rates are reasonable as the hotel is situated in a very upscale part of London. It's walking distance from sloane street, sloane square and kings road. A great boutique option in the SW area. "
November 2014,Designed for sensuality,"We stayed for just one night, regrettably... It was such a beautiful hotel - I would have loved to stay longer!  The room was gorgeous, plush and chic, comfortable and inviting, with great attention to detail.  In keeping with most London hotels, the room was not large although certainly not cramped, and it was beautifully designed.  The bed was one of the most fabulously comfortable beds I've ever slept in, and we both had a fantastic night's sleep.  However it was also one of the most perfect beds for playtime too!  The bedlinen is fabulous and all adds to the sensuality of your stay.  One review I read commented on the dim lighting, but for a romantic sexy stay the lighting simply added to the deliciously sensual experience.  Loved the big mirror over the bed, loved the sexy…"
November 2014,Another excellent stay,really can not fault this hotel. The staff are laid back but very attentive. Best nights sleep I've had this year!  Great breakfast.  Steak wasn't ideal but didn't spoil my trip. Look forward to returning next year
November 2014,Great hotel!,"This was my second time staying at the Belgraves this year and the hotels did not disappoint! Great location, rooms are very nicely appointed, staff is amazing! Location is on a quiet street but close to everything.  I highly recommend."
November 2014,Excellent service,We spent a weekend in London at this hotel recently and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. It's a nice mix of upmarket chic and friendly staff. Plus it's in a great location for west end destinations.  The staff are lovely and the service is excellent. I would recommend the Belgraves for a shopping or sightseeing weekend in town.
November 2014,business trip,A very nice surprise as I did not know the hotel. Great atmosphere. Nice crowd. Great design. Friendly and impeccable service. spacious room and great bathroom. Has parking. Good food at the restaurant.
November 2014,Best Spot in London,Walk distance to tube station and many attractions. Staff is very helpful and friendly. 3min walk to a starbucks!:) Concierge service is brilliant they arrange everything for you and they haven't disappoint us. Will be back again for sure! 
November 2014,Superb hotel with top top service,"My wife and I stayed here for one night ona lastminute.com top secret deal and we were delighted with the choice that we had made. Although the bedroom wasn't the biggest (typical central London), teh king size bed was very comfortable and we had all of the luxuries you would expect from a 5 start hotel. The bath was huge, the complimentary toiletries were lovely but best of all the service was first class. Although everybody from concierge, the bar and reception were brilliant I'd like to highlight Bryan, who served us at breakfast as a great example of how service should be delivered. He was out of this world, very courteous, couldn't do enough for us and had time for a brief chat. We'll definitely be staying here again. Thank you Belgraves. Oh, and teh 1200 checkout was…"
November 2014,Overall very nice hotel in quiet well-located neighborhood,"The hotel is new, and very tastefully appointed. Hip but quiet. Nice bar, limited restaurant service, but you don't want to eat in your hotel when you are in London anyway ! The rooms are very nice, on the smaller side, but spacious enough. The only real complaint I would have is the lack of light in the room, it is almost funny it is so dark, like the designers forgot about it, when the hotel was build... I would go back, great location, quick access to all London has to offer."
January 2015,Fashionable Hotel in Knightsbridge / Belgravia,"Stayed at the Belgraves for one night in January 2015 on our way home. Beautiful hotel located on the border between Knightsbridge and Belgravia. Be prepared to see Rolls Royces, Bentleys and Aston Martins parked on the street in front of the hotel.  Rooms are beautifully appointed, but quite small for two people. A bit of a struggle to move around in the room with two large suitcases. Bathrooms are very modern with a separate cubicle for toilet and the shower is a walk in open shower that looks out onto the bedroom with a nice rainfall. One complaint would be that the rooms are quite dark as well with the only good lighting in the bathroom. Walkable distance to Harrods and nice shops in the area.   This hotel is also very close to the Cabman's Shelter where you can get an egg…"
March 2015,"Fabulous property, great location!","Just spent 3 nights at the Belgraves in London.  VERY happy with the property, staff and restuarant (and room service!). Clean, well appointed and the location was in a lovely neighborhood close to Hyde Park and plenty of fabulous shopping.  Highly recommend this hotel - and would definitely return to the Belgraves Hotel."
February 2015,Most Excellent Hotel With Great Standards And The Best Staff Attention To Detail,"One of the best London based hotels I have ever stayed in.  There are too many chain hotels like Marriott and Hilton that just blend into bland.  This hotel is defiantly not that. It's stylish, well maintained and very individual.  I felt like true luxury was around me.  Congratulations to the hotel team.  You have a winner"
March 2015,Perfection across the board.,"After my second perfect stay @ The Belgraves, I just had to post a review.  From the moment you arrive, to the moment you depart, the staff @ The Belgraves makes certain that you want for nothing.  Front desk, concierge and bartender(s) all get special props! The care is hands-down the best you'll receive.  Not to mention the comfort of the rooms, many of which provide sublime, calming views over Belgraves Square.  Rooms are terrifically comfortable for working or just relaxing. (I especially love the international outlets.) It's also situated to all my favorite shops, and Knightsbridge tube station.  Needless to say, I can't wait for my next stay!"
March 2015,London Chic,"I stayed at Belgraves for one night and wish I could have been there for much longer! Camila at check in was very sweet and was able to check us in before the guaranteed time. The room was excellent, the bathroom massive, and I loved the bay windows with the lovely couch. The room was a nice size and quiet which was great. It had the great feeling of sophistication without being pretentious. I'll definitely be back!"
March 2015,Wonderful Birthday Surprise,"Until my son pulled up outside, I had no idea that I was going to the Belgraves for an overnight stay last Saturday as part of my 60th birthday celebration.  We had driven up from Somerset and arrived, as we thought, too early to book in but it seemed that it was no trouble to take our rooms early.  In recognition of my special birthday, we had all been upgraded to King Superior rooms, my husband & I on the front of the hotel overlooking the square on the 7th floor.  It was lovely!  Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff and they were friendly and attentive.   After a trip to Harrods, we returned to get ready for the theatre to find a beautifully presented chocolate birthday cake slice, complete with hand written message from the hotel, waiting - yummy!  It was a…"
March 2015,You couldn't ask for better,"The hotel is beautiful, chic and modern through welcoming. But it's all about the staff. Everyone there is engaged in helping you achieve whatever you need. I learned everything I needed to know to get to the financial district during peak hour from Brian in the restaurant. Kathryn helped me find hair products that I'd forgotten and took the time to find out what time the shop down the road opened so I could get there before my meeting. Nikki in room service created a special pot of tea for me when I arrived sick with the flu and took the time to check on me later. It's the best experience this business traveler has had in years. I will surely be back. I'm planning my next stay already. "
February 2015,A wonderful break,"We stayed for one night to celebrate my birthday and it was an amazing stay.    My wife contacted the hotel before we arrived to mention it was my birthday.    The online check in was a breeze and we decided to book valet parking to save catching the train and tube.  Arrival at the hotel was easy. We pulled up outside, handed the car keys over and our luggage was brought into the hotel for us.  Check in was quick, friendly and efficient. We were given our room key and it was then that I was wished a happy birthday and that the room was the hotel's present to me.  We were shown up to the room - we had been upgraded from a Premium king room to one of the king suites. The room was simply stunning!!  Later that afternoon, there was a knock at the door and I was presented with a…"
February 2015,"Fantastic, as always","Just spent two lovely nights and this is to confirm that it is indeed the best option in London. Room was excellent, as always. The bar and living room on the mezzanine one of the best places to spend your time in London. The personnel is fantastic, definitely an asset of Thompson there.  Breakfast is ideal. Everything seems as if the hotel opened just recently. If there is something that makes me wonder it is the fact that by surprise there is no Cnn International within the tv bouquet which is nevertheless quite big. The sliders and/or the burgers are a must!! Looking forward to returning in two days. Keep it up guys!!!"
January 2015,Best Hotel in London!,"Had an amazing stay at the Belgraves!  Stayed there with girlfriends for the night.  Great location, friendly and helpful staff, beautiful decor and rooms.  The hidden gem is the bar and the food.  Everything from the restuarant to room service is first class quality and reasonably priced.  I would recommend this place to anyone visitng London!"
January 2015,Neighborhood feel in trendiest part of London,"Love this hotel! Service was top notch!  Room was comfortable and interestingly decorated, albeit a bit small. (It is London!) Bathroom was beautiful and rainhead shower was divine.  The neighborhood is fantastic--many great restaurants and great shopping--Harrod's is a 5 minute walk away.  Two tube stops not far from the hotel.  Upstairs bar was hip and served great drinks. The overall feel is that you're in your own apartment in the trendiest part of London.  I will definitely stay at this hotel again!"
January 2015,wonderful service,Spent a Saturday evening at the Belgraves a Thompson Hotel my Husband and myself. We were looked after from the minute we arrived the gentleman at reception was great and very helpful. We upgraded straight away and ended up with the Kings Suite which was great. We were celebrating my Husbands birthday and the gentleman at reception arranged for a wonderful happy birthday dessert to be in out room just before we arrived back in the aftrenoon. They waited whilst we had champagne in the bar and it was delivered as we arrived to the room. We had drinks in the bar and the approach again from the staff was professional they engaged in conversation and were happy to ensure our stay went well. The hotel was central and literally only minutes away from Harrods and Harvey Nichols. I also…
January 2015,Wonderful stay in Belgraves London !,"Few minutes walk to Harrods, lots of great shops in walking distance. Sophisticated and beautiful hotel and I was able to sleep well since I am not usually able to while I am traveling.  Staff were very friendly and helpful in everyway and I was able to get lots of help to get to places that I needed to go… since It was my first visit in London."
December 2014,A bit of trendy New York in Belgravia,"Very stylish boutique hotel near Belgrave Square. They were trying quite hard to be trendy, and it lacked a lot of the warmth and character of my favorite hotels, but it was a pleasant stay all the same. The bed was comfortable and I enjoyed the little couch/ lounge area by the window. The biggest issue for me were lights in the room. The first night I could not for the life of me figure out how to turn off all the lights! I pressed & clicked- and there were still random uplights shining, despite my best efforts. By the second night, I had somewhat figured it out. I realized I could have just taken the room card out of the power switch to turn everything off, but it was chilly and I wanted the heat!  There was also a clicking noise that I hear in my room- and my coworker heard…"
December 2014,Nice but at quite a price,"Stayed for a Friday night in early December.  A pricey hotel, but relatively well positioned and tube stations not too far away.  Room was clean, fairly spacious and well equipped.  Bathroom nicely styled, with great walk-in shower.  Have rated as average in relation to the price - if you can get via discount routes, then makes more sense....otherwise you are paying a high premium just for the upmarket area."
December 2014,"Wonderful stay, beautiful hotel","I stayed here for a couple of weeks in September and December, as well as over a weekend in October. Every stay has been wonderful. I love the hotel's central location - it's really near Harvey Nichols and Harrods, but is nestled in a quiet area along Pont Street, so it doesn't feel like you're staying someplace busy. The hotel itself is beautiful and contemporary, with an excellent restaurant that serves modern British cuisine focused on seafood. I have multiple allergies, and despite my fussy diet the restaurant staff accommodated my requests without problems. The front desk handled my reservations very well, and the concierge were friendly and helpful with everything. I had fallen ill during my stay, and the concierge helped me to arrange a visit from the doctor, which was…"
January 2015,Good hotel in plush upmarket area,"I have stayed in many 5 star properties in both London & around the world and although a lovely hotel I have to stay it is not quite up there with other 5 star establishments. I booked the break for my Birthday and although mentioning the occasion in an email prior to my stay there was no additional touches in the room like a card or cake to wish me happy birthday which is something other hotels, even 4 star have executed very well in the past. The concierge were dressed in jeans and checkered shirts which although matched the cool laid back vibe of the hotel I found it too casual and scruffy for a hotel of the 5 star calibre. The concierge were polite but I did not find them friendly and they did not look like they wanted to be there. Also in the evening I asked if they could…"
June 2014,Excellent hotel!,"My husband snatched up a room here last minute when the hotel his company paid for was dirty and covered in bugs. We arrived quite late in the evening but received a warm welcome from the staff. The room was lovely and modern, the bed was comfy, and we both loved the rainshower. Our room had no view whatsoever, but I didn't expect the best room available since we made a last minute booking. The location is excellent - we would definitely stay here again."
December 2013,"Great, but not fantastic","So, Belgraves has a new, relaxed and stylish feel, located in Belgravia among the embassies in London.  My wife and I paid a little extra to get a superior room, but were slightly underwhelmed as the view we got was not as good as advertised and the window seat felt a little cramped.  You really need to request a room on the top floors to get a view worth writing home about.  Staff was friendly and the room was comfortable, although slightly smaller than expected.  We left with a feeling of ""been there done that"" and will try a different hotel next time we want to treat ourselves to something special in London."
July 2014,Stunning Hotel...,"The Belgraves is one of the most stylish hotels I have stayed in and I will definitely be recommending to anyone looking for a room in London.  The rooms are super 5* and have a chic, modern look.  The location is fantastic, and only a short walk away from the amazing shops Belgravia and Sloane Street have to offer.  The bar at the Belgraves has the most perfect atmosphere for relaxing and sipping cocktails with friends, and the staff are exceptional.  I will be a frequent visitor!"
June 2014,Posh Belgravia without any pretense,We stayed three nights at the Belgraves at the end of our UK trip and it was absolutely perfect.  We were upgraded from a superior to a deluxe room on the 9th floor.  We had a small balcony with a great view of the London Eye -- spectacular day and night.  The hotel is a convenient walk to Sloane Square and the Tube as well as lovely shopping on King's Road Chelsea.  Only one small hiccup that was solved amazingly well.  The chambermaid mistakenly threw out an item that was not trash and the hotel actually found it!  Incredible above-and-beyond service.  Special recognition to the concierge staff as well.  Everything was professional and lovely.  Make sure to walk to Motcomb St. for lunch at Ottolenghi and to Thomas Cubitt for a charming gastropub experience.
June 2014,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel for 1 night on a Saturday, had booked a King Superior room but was given a complimentary upgrade to a King Deluxe room upon arrival, wonderful! All of the staff were lovely and made us feel very welcome during our stay. The room was absolutely spotless, stylish and very spacious. The whole hotel had a very luxurious feel to it without being pretentious or trying too hard. Will definitely be returning to this hotel when next in London!"
June 2014,Private Party,"I recently celebrated my 40th Birthday at Belgraves and I couldn't have hoped to find a better venue or service in central London. The Snug area of the bar was allocated to us all evening, and the drinks and canapes flowed! There were 42 people in attendance and everyone commented on the quality of the food and the charming nature of the people looking after us. Throughout the whole event, including the planning, I was very well taken care of, and thank you to everyone for making it a very special event. A special thank you to Marianna who is the perfect party planner. I'm now trying to think of another cause for celebration so that I can come back!"
June 2014,Fantastic Hotel...but....,"I am giving the Belgraves a 5 star rating,  The hotel is fantastic... from the door staff (dressed casual) to the check-in, everything is perfect,  You are treated like a friend, not a customer.  In fact, this is what makes the hotel so special.  In London i have never met so hospitable staff,,,well done to all.  The room was a great size for London and quite funky (jellied sweets in the mini-bar...mmmm).  However, the air conditioning was an issue.  It was the hottest day of the year and the air-con was not working - if you turned it on it was set at 30 degrees.  my room was like a sauna.  I did mention this to reception on day 1 and they said there was major works going on and would be sorted that night...unfortunately not!  Despite this, i would not hesitate to recommend this…"
June 2014,You Have To Stay Here !,"I booked this hotel at the last minute for a weekend in the capital.  The Belgraves is one of the coolest hotels I have every stayed in, and I couldn't recommend it enough to anyone who wants relaxed luxury in one of the most beautiful areas of London. The service, ranging from' the most stylish Doorman you will ever see' to the Bar Hostess, from the Breakfast Waitress to the Receptionists local knowledge was exceptional.  It is a rarity to be acknowledged so openly by all members of staff, which speaks volumes for the hotels' ethos of excellent customer service. The rooms were spotless and extremely comfortable with everything you would expect in luxury hotel. You need to put The Belgraves on your ""must go to"" list..........."
June 2014,Best luxury hotel in London,"The Belgraves is a sleek, trendy and unique hotel in the posh Knightsbridge neighborhood in London. It ticks all the boxes: great food, amazing design, perfect location and friendly service...if you are not on a budget, obviously! The rooms are very comfortable despite being quite small, so I would recommend to opt for a king premium or a studio suite. One of the great assets of this property is its bar located on the mezzanine floor, which is the perfect place to work, meet, chill, eat and sip a drink, not to mention its beautiful, yet friendly and professional, waitresses."
June 2014,My favourite hotel in London!,"The best value-for-money hotel in town, in my view. This hotel is highly recommended for its cozy, modern, clean rooms, the high-level of services offered by the extremely friendly staff and of course its hidden gem: the terrace! I've stayed there in my last 4 business trips to London and it almost felt like being at home! Looking forward to my next stay there Highly recommended even for business travelers!"
July 2014,Fantastic stay! My new home in London,"Stayed for a week with my wife, we were torn between Soho and Belgravia, however, having visited Soho during our stay we were happy with the decision we made as the location of this hotel is a 5 minute walk from either Knightsbridge or Sloane Square.  Staff are attentive, sharp and eager to help with anything. A special thanks to Diego the concierge officer who felt more like a friend that a concierge officer.  One particular aspect that I appreciated came when I had asked the hotel to move my dates around due to an unforeseeable circumstance. Ultimately, the hotel completely obliged despite the reservation being non-cancellable, no-changeable and non-anything-able.   This time of empathy and consideration is not something that you would not find everywhere."
June 2014,"Great suites- fun ""floating in air"" bath tubs!","This place is a pleasant change from other stuffier hotels in this neighborhood. Attractive lobby and great breakfast served on ground floor. Loved the suite, the bathroom projects from side of building so the bath is surrounded by 3 sides of glass- it is like having a bath in a tree house!  Very friendly staff, great location. We will be making this our regular London hotel."
September 2013,We loved our stay at the Belgraves!,"We stayed here in July 2013. The location of this hotel is so perfect! 5 minutes to Harrods and Knightsbridge tube station, Sloane street and Harvey Nics. The staff are all young and eager to please. The decor is uber chic and trendy! The rooms are cosy and very well designed and the beds are amazing. The breakfast, although a small spread, was outstanding, The quality of each option from the fruit to the yogurt really set it apart from other hotel breakfasts.   We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely go back!"
July 2014,A great stay at the Belgraves Hotel,"If your seeking a modern, sleek, clean and well managed hotel in the heart of London and close to Harrods, Hyde Park and restaurants then this is for you. Beautifully appointed rooms, with bed linens fit for a king, wireless internet throughout, and an awesome bar for late night drinks and snacks. We didnt eat at the restaurant but the menu certainly looked appealing. Too many other great restaurants in London to enjoy. Extremely pleasant staff to cater to your needs in a casual atmosphere without being over stuffy. If you need a workout, the gym offers everything you need from free weights to machines. The perfect hotel in the ideal setting in one of the worlds best cities. Highly recommended for business and leisure travellers seeking a centrally located hotel."
July 2014,A friendly place to stay in the middle of London,I stayed with my two kids for five days and the people could not have been nicer. The concierge was excellent.  She helped me book tickets for some of the museums and her restaurant selection was  perfect. Both the adults and the kids were happy. In general all of the people we extra friendly. 
February 2014,great stay!,"Great hotel, hip staff and very nice decor.  Restaurant was very good and the distance to knightsbridge was very close within walking distant.  The room was very clean and tidy with great sleeping comfort.  I would definately stay there again if I was in London.  The smoking den was very cool especially in cold and rainy weather.  Amenities were great also."
February 2014,Loved it,"We were over for a Chelsea game and decided to stay at Belgraves this time round.  The location was great for us just off Sloane Square and a few minutes walk from the Kings Road and bars, shops and restaurants.  We were able to walk to the game and stop for a nice breakfast enroute.  The room was spacious for a London hotel and we liked the design of the hotel as well.  It was a bit pricey but you get what you pay for in London in my humble opinion and Belgraves was top notch."
June 2014,Great stay,Stayed here in June2014 for 2 weeks.unusually long stay for me in one hotel. Staff could not be more helpful and after upgrading to a larger room I had a super stay.  Rooms are very well appointed and restaurants and bars are much enjoyed.  Breakfast a real treat. Used hotel primarily for business but charming staff made me feel at home! Location in Belgravia is delightful and quiet.  Already booked back for my next visit later this month.
July 2014,Summer in London,"We've had brilliant weather and the service at this hotel makes me feel like I'm visiting a friend as opposed to a hotel. It's small and inviting, without been too cramped.   The boiled eggs and sourdough soldiers are a brekkie favourite. As is avocado smashed on rye.   Will be back "
July 2014,Excellent hotel in fantastic location,"Wow! When I first walked it I thought this would be a Hudson NYC-style hotel: dark, trendy but dirty and with terrible service. Man was I wrong! The staff are very friendly and the hotel is very well maintained and clean. Needless to say, location is top notch. We got a fifth-floor room with great views of the small park accross the street. Rooms are very convenient and quiet, but a bit small (but hey, it's Belgravia!). A thoroughly good experience, will certainly return.  Btw, there is a great italian coffee store around the corner."
October 2014,"Great hotel and location, consistently enjoyable","I have stayed at the Belgraves 3 times in the last 6 months, always for business, and it has been consistently wonderful.  The location is amazing, a few blocks behind the Berkeley Hotel but half the price while still close to Sloane Square and Harrods/Harvey Nichols.  The hotel decor is stylish and offers a nice bar and separate restaurant.  The rooms are terrific ~ newly decorated with white marble bathrooms, rooms have cosy/natural/sexy/lightly masculine decor ~ and the gym is very good too.  The only thing missing is the lack of a spa, but it's hard to have everything.  The staff is highly professional in every capacity (front desk, spa, concierge, room service).  I'll definitely be staying here again."
July 2014,Consistently good,"I have stayed in the Belgraves several times and am really pleased to make the same consistent quality experience every time.  The staff is extremely well trained and go out of their way to be helpful, from reception, concierge, events, to room service and bar. The rooms are very cosy and well designed, and always impeccably clean, often with a nice view to the communal garden and square.  The breakfast and lunch is delicious and offers many healthy options, no unusual request has been declined.   All the above has made the Belgraves my favorite London hotel."
September 2014,Great Location and an insane burger !,"My wife and just checked out from the hotel, and we really enjoyed our stayed there. We were upgraded to a very nice suite with great views and art works from very well known artists. The service was sharp and the bar scene was casual with class and great drinks and tapas. The location is good with many options for shopping and dining within a stroll from the front door. I really recommend this hotel and will most probably come back next year."
August 2014,Belgraves A wonderful Hotel,"Just returned from a short break to the Belgraves, a Thompson Hotel situated just off of Sloane street with all of the designer boutiques from GUCCI, Dolce & Gabbana to Roberto Cavalli, their all there, to say its in a great location is an understatement Harvey Nics and Harrods a short walking distance.  THe hotel was a breath of fresh air, the staff were very courteous and welcoming couldn't do enough for you, we arrived early and was offered our room some four hours before check in proper if we waited ten minutes, this was not a problem for us as we wanted to go straight out, so they stored our luggage.  Upon our return the staff welcomed us by name which is a very nice touch, and continued to remember our name throughout our stay which was greatly appreciated, all the staff…"
July 2014,Awesome hotel,"The staff at this hotel were amazing!  Friendly and helpful from the moment of our arrival until our departure.  My 13 year old son and I were in London for a long weekend and Belgraves provided a luxurious place to rest our weary bodies after each day of touring.  Diego, the concierge, was especially helpful in providing detailed directions and advice on using the Tube.  Everyone went out of their way to make us feel at home.  Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone,"
May 2014,A beautiful anniversary,"My partner bought me here to celebrate our anniversary. The staff on check in were delightful, and we had a good chat about local things to do while we were there. The concierge Violetta was most informative, helpful and booked us a beautiful seafood restaurant only a few minutes away from the hotel for our evening meal that night. The room was spacious, the bathroom beautiful and the gift of a small champagne bottle sent up from the reception ladies is exactly the sort of thoughtful gesture that inclined us to return for a second visit only a few weeks later. Overall a excellent stay, will be returning for many years to come."
March 2014,"Perfect location & excellent concierge, but rooms are small & no view","New hotel, a full makeover to the former Sheraton. Tasteful interiors. Perfect location. Excellent concierge.  However small rooms & low ceiling - not the level I expected from a 5 star hotel, but most importantly - no view whatsoever. When asked for another room, got a different one, but still no view."
August 2014,great stay once again,"this was the second time my son and myself stayed here, and it certainly won't be the last. Ideal spot when travelling with a wheelchair user, as my son is. the staff could not be more helpful and the room we were given was perfect for the wheelchair with a huge shower and toilet area. once again many thanks for everything to all staff, can't wait for our next visit."
July 2014,Trendy Hotel in Knightsbridge,"Stayed for four nights with my wife. The hotel is in a quiet location in Knightsbridge,  an easy walk to Sloan Square and  or Knightbridge tube station so it is well located. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful . The standard room is small but in good condition. It was very hot and humid in London and the air conditioning cooled the room well. We had a rattling sound emanating  from our room fridge and requested for the room fridge to be switched off. The maintenance staff promptly arrived and advised us there was a problem with the aircon unit and not the fridge. The maintenance man contacted reception who were able to upgrade us to a small suite late that evening after we had returned from dinner. This was well handled and made a negative issue into a positive issue.…"
August 2014,"Top Notch, Classy, ""Spot On"" Service - (and the expected small room!)","Being a New York City resident it's easy for me to understand why any major international city hotel room can limited on space, so I wasn't surprised at the tight quarters of their ""Standard"" room with King Bed.  Yes, the standard rooms are small-esque, but they are also perfectly lovely, comfortable and well appointed thanks to the designers of this new-to-London hotel.  The Belgraves gets my 5 circle top rating.  If you are traveling on a business expense account and USD $1000/night won't break the bank simply ""pay up"" for one of their suites.  The Belgraves' suites and Penthouse will certainly give any business executive the luxury and extra space you'd expect in a 5-star experience.  A few more tidbits to round out my personal experience ~ The hotel property is located in an…"
May 2014,My favorite hotel :),"Really it's was a very nice night's with a Thompson hotel I extremely recommend this hotel for everyone looking for modern ,cleaning,friendly,amazing and wonderful hotel. Everything was over my expectation hotel staff never find  like them they are amazing,location,rooms, cleaning, lounge and wifi."
May 2014,Amazing time,"We had a amazing time, When we arrived we were upgraded to a better room which was great, had a great view from the balcony of the London eye and Big Ben!  We then asked if we could have the full English breakfast instead of continental and pay the difference, but to our surprise we didn't have to pay for the difference and this was included! Absolutely great environment/ atmosphere and the room décor was really nice. It was a surprise for my partner and he loved it! Thank you for being so kind and courteous!"
May 2014,Great Place,"Cozy, modern rooms, nice location, and wonderful staff highlight the Belgraves.  We stayed for our 30th anniversary and our first visit to London, and it was a really nice place to call home for a few days.  We arrived early but they had a room ready for us with a nice view of The Shard and Big Ben.  Room Service made us breakfast ahead of the posted time several days in a row, and the restaurant and lounge were both top notch.  I would definately stay there again."
May 2014,Great Hotel....Great People,"We arrived at the hotel early, before official check in time.  Our allocated room was not ready so another room was found immediately.  This set the tone for the stay, nothing was too much trouble, the reception staff were friendly, helpful and interested.  The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the Knightsbridge tube stop in Belgravia.  The hotel is not at all pretentious, there is quite a chilled vibe.  The bar follows the same theme with guests and locals meeting here.  The interiors of the hotel are stylish in a modern way and the hotel must have been fitted out recently as the decor seemed fresh and new.  I went to see the Concierge to book some theatre tickets which she sorted out quickly and efficiently.  Whilst we were talking I mentioned it was our wedding anniversary.  When…"
May 2014,STAY HERE!!,Just a wonderful top notch hotel all around ... The best part was the staff and how accommodating they were.  Mathia and Anita were very warm and welcoming and everyone made me feel right at home.  The rooms are beautiful and well appointed.  The bar scene was very cool with a nice mix of locals and tourists!
May 2014,Great location and hotel!,"Great location, really nice friendly and helpful staff, good breakfast, great design, everything spotlessly clean and an excellent night's sleep as the rooms are so quiet.  Highly recommend the Belgraves and would like to return soon!"
May 2014,Really loved it,"Haven't stayed here but i did visit it! Lovely design, great restaurant and an even greater mesanin! The rooms are really nice and good size! They have all the utilities you need and the staff is extremlly friendly! Shout out to the girls from sales! Great hosts!"
April 2014,"Great Experience at Belgraves - Lovely hotel, great ambiance and charming staff","Really loved this hotel in a beautiful neighborhood...easy to get cabs fro hotel and easy walk to Sloane Square for shopping and the tube to get anywhere. This is a special hotel with welcoming staff and a great vibe. Room Service was excellent, and the hotel gave us a birthday cake for my daughter who was celebrating her 18th... Rooms are very well appointed, and the bed was extremely comfortable. No room in London is going to be vast unless you pay for a suite, but I found the room a good size, the couch nook was a nice touch. I love the location and the ability to walk through gorgeous squares and just enjoy the neighborhood. Super staff and super comfortable"
April 2014,Excellent Stay,"We stayed at Belgraves this weekend to celebrate our anniversary. From start to finish it was a brilliant experience. The staff are some of the most helpful and attentive I have experienced, they could not do enough for us during our stay. At check in, during conversation, the receptionist asked us the reason for our stay, we mentioned our anniversary, and when we came back from our day of shopping we had champagne on ice, fruit, and a note from the staff wishing us congratulations. Lovely touch. The shower was lovely, very modern design.  Overall, we had a really great time!"
February 2014,Friendly Unpretentious Vibe,"What I liked:  The location: 10 minutes walk to 3 tube stations. Knightsbridge, with its restaurants, shops etc is your oyster.  The check in: I arrived at 10 am and was given a room straight away. Others seemed to have a similar experience and my own room was serviced early while I was at breakfast. So there seems to be a better than average chance of getting an early room. Checking in and out were friendly and efficient.  The bar: Very inclusive warm vibe and top notch cocktails. It is a small bar. Though there are seating areas, I kept to the bar and had some very pleasant chats with friendly and interesting people. The bartender made great martinis of various kinds. The Vesper was of course shaken. The classic gin martini was of course stirred...(Yes, I do have childish…"
April 2014,Good value and modern,"Its a good value hotel, the rooms are a little small but modern and great location, ticks all the boxes. Its you want style on a budget this is it for sure, with a nice bar on the 1st floor for meeting etc too"
April 2014,Perfect Location,"We discovered this hotel through Visa Luxury Hotel Collection. Stayed here for 6 nights and were greatly impressed with location, friendliness and helpful of hotel staff. First location: it's in a quiet more residential neighborhood but walking distance to many attractions such as Buckingham Palace. It's also walking distance to Knightsbridge area and Slone Square for catching the underground which we did for getting to attractions further away. These locations were also good for dining and shopping. Also walking distace to Victoria Coach Station where we were to meet for a tour to Windsor Castle.  The staff always remembered us and were exceptionally polite. They arranged for a taxi for us at 5:30am when none were nearby. We also bought our Tower of London tickets there saving…"
March 2014,Excellent hotel...total luxury!,"We have just spent a night at the hotel and was quite simply perfect!  Service (even before we arrived) was exceptional.  The hotel is über stylish and located in the heart of Belgravia, londons most exclusive area.  It's within easy access to the luxury Knightsbridge and Chelsea shops and restaurants and not to far to walk to Mayfair and the west end.  The rooms are luxurious with Hughes comfy beds!   Food and drink were excellent and would recommend the Pont St restaurant. Excellent fish restaurant but certainly not limited to seafood.    Would thoroughly recommend...a real 5star hotel!"
March 2014,It's all about service,"From start to finish of a three night stay we received really first class service - every member of staff is friendly and they are all keen to make your stay feel special. When you add this to very well designed rooms, a truly comfortable bed and an excellent buffet breakfast, what more can you say? If I try to look for a couple of slightly critical comments, maybe some of the staff in the breakfast room could try to break into a smile more frequently and why were all the clocks on the lift showing incorrect times? But that is really being pedantic - well done to the team at a really well run hotel."
April 2014,excellent,"""I’ll start by saying that I am well traveled and have stayed in my fair share of high-end hotels across the world.  With that said, I am truly impressed and beyond satisfied with the service I have received at the Belgrave Hotel in London.   This hotel ranks high as far as its location and overall cleanliness.  However,  what makes this establishment a real gem, is the amazing staff and  their impeccable customer service.  The personnel was very welcoming and beyond accommodating, not only to myself, but to the entire group (of 8) I traveled with. They were one of the most genuine and wholehearted staff I have encountered, and this made for a very pleasant experience.   I HIGHLY recommend the Belgrave Hotel and it’s top-notch staff."""
March 2014,Lovely!,"We stayed there 2 nights.  They arranged a baby cot as soon as I mentioned about our stay with an infant. The room was not big enough to get in with the stroller, we had to leave it at the front desk which did not bother me at all.  The hotel is located perfect for shopping, near Harrods and Harvey Nichols, and many more stores! Also there is Waitrose (Grocery store) nearby and it is convenient to get an extra goods if needed.  Hotel staff is kind enough, you will get average nice service.  Breakfast was quite good with the choice of healthy juice such as green smoothies and so on!  We have got this hotel by hotwire, and we were satisfied for what we paid for.   Nice to feel Posh area of London."
March 2014,Service! It makes all the difference.,"Europe is not known for its service (by North American standards, anyway); I know because I have lived in Europe and in general the service is not high quality. EXCEPT at Belgraves. The service at this hotel is outstanding and very genuine. I so appreciated all the staff: the doorman/porter, front desk, maintenance, restaurant staff, and concierge. Everyone I encountered was delightful and really engaging. It made my stay in London wonderful.   The hotel itself is also wonderful if you like small boutique properties. It is set in a lovely neighborhood and is decorated very tastefully; an easy place to relax. Rooms are small to average size (it is Europe) and very comfortable. The ONLY constructive criticism that I have is that the sound proofing is not adequate . . . I was privy…"
March 2014,Exquisite!,Top tier professional talent all of whom deserve a round of applause.  Great venue but it's the staff that raises the bar even  higher.  Highly recommended for the business or vacation traveler.  Neighborhood is lovely as well.
March 2014,Average,"We stayed here this weekend and liked the design and atmosphere, the room however was still not so big for it's type and there was no isolation towards the hallway resulting in everything being heard crystal clear both ways. Sure the design was nice, but that did not make up for the fact that our sense of privacy was gone nor did it make up for the lack of running water on our day of check-out which was not event compensated for by the hotel."
June 2014,We loved it!,"My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel for two nights during a brief stay in London.  We loved it! We are relatively frequent travellers, and were thoroughly impressed with this hotel. I don't have anything negative to say about it.  It was hip and stylish without being overly pretentious, very well designed, comfortable, etc.  We loved the bathroom, and also loved the little window seat in the bedroom.    I had read other reviews about the location not being good, but for us it was perfect.  South of Knightsbridge and north of Sloan stations, it is within walking distance of upscale gastropubs and cafes, close enough to walk interesting places and within easy access to transportation.    Finally, the service was top knotch. We were so impressed with every single person…"
November 2014,"Elegant, Understated, Sublime","This has got to be one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. Let me tell you why…  With none of the pompous airs of larger hotels, this gem caters to guests who seek and appreciate the best things in life, but shy away from the ostentatious flash and vulgarity of conspicuous consumption.  At first sight, the hotel looks like a regular, smallish boutique hotel. But, as you begin to experience your stay, you become aware of all of the attention, refinement, and care that go into making sure the experience of every guest is simply fantastic.  Only items and products of the highest quality are used to furnish the rooms and bathrooms. I especially loved the richness of the towels and bathrobes. Room service is a real treat–from the presentation, cutlery, and linens, all the…"
October 2014,Restaurant ,"We did not stay at the hotel despite having seen one of the rooms. We enjoyed a lunch at the restaurant and have to say that despite being empty, the food was absolutely delicious and the staff very friendly. I seriously recommend this place for a quiet lunch and the heart of Belgravia."
May 2014,Excellent! Quiet Location but close to Everything!,"If you want a great hotel in a great location, then stay here.  The staff is very friendly, the concierge took care of our every need, and the room was very comfortable and had a great view (room 905). You're close to the Knightsbridge Tube station, and the walk is easy from many locations (we walked from Mayfair back to our hotel).  If you stay here, I would recommend lunch at The Pantechnicon (2 minute walk from the hotel), and breakfast at Harvey Nichols (about a 5 minute walk) was quick and delicious.  If you want chocolate or delicious macarons, go to Pierre Hermes (just around the corner).  My husband and I remarked every day what a great location the hotel was in. We'll definitely stay here again.  We were celebrating our anniversary and the Belgraves staff surprised us…"
October 2014,Lovely hotel for a suprise   trip to London!,"My partner booked this hotel for us to stay in whilst having a weekend away in London. Upon arrival we were greeted by lovely staff, our room was just lovely and we were provided with a bottle of champagne on ice! The cocktails from the bar were delicious, felt really lucky to be in such a lovely place. On our last morning we had breakfast In the hotel, very pricey but lovely. Will definitely return and will also check out their hotels in other countries. "
October 2014,Lovely hotel!,"Our trip to London was to celebrate my husband's 50th by having a meal at Petrus. The location of this hotel was just perfect for this as well as later when we went to Leicester Square as the tube station was only a 5 minute walk. We could not fault the service we received from the minute we arrived with friendly staff, valet parking (extra cost @ £45  but worth it) and then later when we had been in the room (an upgrade to a king suite, room 402 - lovely!) for a while, a knock on the door to find a personalised piece of cake complete with candle being presented to my husband for his birthday, a really thoughtful touch that we appreciated. The hotel is really well presented, exceptionally clean and modern but still retaining an informal atmosphere thanks to the staff who…"
December 2013,What Hospitality is all about.,"I first stayed at the Belgraves in May of this year. I had a few unimportant issues about the room which I took the time to explain to the front desk staff when I checked out. I was pleasantly surprised when I received an email from the management the following day saying that they had been attentive to my remarks and that they would remedy the situation the next time around. When I booked a superior room three weeks ago, I was upgraded to a King Suite. I must say that this one of the few hotels where they go out of their way to make a customer feel special. The restaurant is very good and the staff very attentive and friendly. I would certainly recommend it."
September 2014,Convenient luxury,"I stayed here for one night before going to Oxford for a Harper's Bazaar event at the Chic Outlet Shopping village. No wonder they chose this hotel for international journalists to stay in. It's small and exclusive but it's also very sophisticated. Obviously it's located near Harrods, in a super posh neighborhood ... but it's also a walk away from London's amazing parks. I think it's great for just sleeping and dining... didn't look like much fun..and was even borderline boring.. for 1 night, it's great and convenient...but i don't think i would stay longer than that...for business, it's perfect. i did however, reallllllly enjoy the breakfast downstairs."
October 2014,Used to be a lot better,"Whilst the hotel itself is lovely and the rooms are great. There has definitely been slide for the worst in terms of the service.  Certainly you would expect more considering the price.  The staff seem to be all fairly new and there is a lack of ""character and charm"" about the service provided.    There are certainly better places in the area to stay....."
October 2014,A London gem!,"Stayed here recently on my wedding night! We had just one evening booked, and the staff made us feel like royalty throughout our stay! I love the whole Thompsons hotel group aesthetic, and this one of theirs in London is fabulous. Low key chic and quiet glamour are the order of the day. For us, after a long frenetic day- we collapsed into the lovely restaurant late in the evening- the manager and his waiters were fabulous- funny, cool and attentive. I'd highly recommend their burger, and don't be put off by the expense of the wines- they are more than worth it! All in all- this is one of london a coolest little hotels in what is unarguably one of the most gorgeous neighbourhoods of the city. Book now!"
February 2014,Luxurious hotel in a fantastic location,"We booked 2 rooms for a 1 night stay as we were moving to a larger apartment to accommodate our large family for a long stay in London.  Our rooms were luxurious, decorated in the highest manor. One of our rooms was an accessible room (for disabled) which meant the bathroom was overly large and spacious which helped with our kids.   The staff were all faultless. From the concierge, to the boys out the front, friendly reception staff and restaurant staff too.  The lobby is dark, sleek and impressive. First impressions do count and The Belgraves got it right.   We had dinner in the restaurant because our kids were tired after a long day of travelling from the Netherlands and we were blown away by the friendly service, speedy delivery of the food, recommendations from the staff and…"
February 2014,High quality service in one of the best locations in London,"Overall extremely satisfied with the service and the hotel. Got a pleasant upgrade at check-in, the concierge happily assisted me with the newspaper and magazine of my choice. Room very comfy and staff very friendly. Would definitely recommend The Belgraves for those who wish to stay in one of the most residential (and not that commercial) neighbourhoods of West London!"
February 2014,This hotel exceeded our expectations,"Excellent location, nice/warm/tasteful decoration, nice breakfast room and buffet, very nice, popular bar and very well trained staff. Comfortable, quality beds, linens, towels. Got a good price through jet setter."
December 2013,Great staff,"Stayed for along weekend.Staff very caring and helpful.Rooms clean and modern with really nice  Bathroom.Very centrally placed for Kensington,Chelsea and easy buses to West End from Sloane Street. Restaurant overpriced and not well cooked food,soggy tempura oysters,should have sent them back.Palm restaurant next door better but still overpriced. Better to head down to Chelsea to eat."
February 2014,Fantastic stay over NYE 2013,"Situated in a great part of London, close to all the Knightsbridge amenities, I chose this hotel as a base for our NYE celebrations at the end of 2013. From the moment we arrived, the staff were extremely helpful and courteous. Even beforehand, Diego, from concierge, had been in touch to offer helpful suggestions for dinner and drinks. Our stay was extra special as I was proposing to my girlfriend that evening, so I had asked the hotel in advance if there was anything they could do to make more memorable. Needless to say, Sarah Vinson and the team at the front office, made sure we had a awesome stay and upgraded us to a suite on one of the top floors, which gave great views over London. We didn't realise until Midnight that we also got to see the fireworks from the London Eye.…"
February 2014,Excellent hotel,"An excellent location between Sloane square and Knightsbridge.  This hotel has a nice atmosphere and very friendly and attentive staff.  Rooms are nice and well looked after, only negative issue we experienced was an intermittent noise that  emanated from the air conditioning and kept us awake.   This was reported to the staff in the morning who were very apologetic and said that would look into this.  All in all an excellent Hotel."
December 2013,"Perfect location, fantastic hotel!","The hotel is situated in a very lovely part of London, it is an easy 5 minute walk from Sloane Square station and the service from staff was undeniably the best I have ever received. Staff continuously opened doors, were always happy to help, very friendly and approachable. Upon arrival we were given an upgraded room and the view and size was absolutely perfect!  We had room service for breakfast which was delicious and it arrived within a few minutes of ordering. Would definitely revisit; only down side was slamming doors in the middle of the night but anyone could be at fault. Overall a very good experience!"
March 2014,Perfect city hideaway...,"The Belgraves is the perfect city hideaway from it all! Nestled in the streets of Belgravia you are within easy walking distance of the all the lovely shops of Harvey Nichols, Harrods and the Brompton Quarter. My sister & I chose the Belgraves for a Boxing Day get away to escape all the Christmas madness & I can truly say it was a very memorable experience. From the moment we arrived the staff & service could not be faulted - one word ""seamless"".  We booked a Premium Room with 2 full sized beds - the rest of the room was spacious & eleglantly appointed & I loved the window seat - fabulous for putting up the feet and watching the world go by with a glass of bubbles in hand. You caneasily take inspiration from the interiors in the guest areas especially the bar / lounge and apply…"
March 2014,5 star rating reflective of my experience,"This being a Thompson hotel its similar in concept to many others I've stayed at. Ultra-modern clean finishes etc. the lobby is intimate some would find it a little cramped but its a minor point of observation. Staff were very attentive, we got a room upgrade at check in which may be biasing my review since the entry level rooms are much smaller (typical European sizes). The room itself it fully furnished with every conceivable modern amenity. Love the built in US/EU/UK plugs a minor but welcomed convenience. For a suite it is not my ideal layout. I would prefer a decent dining table (or at least a table suitable for dining on) to a large lounge and a larger bathroom with a tub. Aesthetic is very clean with extra wide hard wood paneling adorning the floors and walls."
March 2014,Perfect!!!,"My Husband and I stayed at the Belgraves last night for his 30th Birthday. From the moment we stepped foot into the hotel we we're impressed. The concierge was fantastic, likewise were the receptionists. We stayed in a studio king suite which they had kindly upgraded us to and it was amazing. They had even put a birthday cake in the room! The room was spacious and we had a bath tub that over looked the gardens. I would highly recommend it to anyone, you won't be disappointed. It is the best place we have ever stayed!!!"
March 2014,Plush & friendly hotel with great service,"We stayed in room 204 for 5 nights in a king premium room.  The room was very stylish, quiet and comfortable with ample space for luggage.  The two reading nooks in the bay windows were cosy and a nice spot to relax after a long day of sightseeing.  There wasn't much of a view, the room looked directly at buildings across the street.   There was no tea / coffee in room when we arrived but was available from their room additions menu and came almost instantly when we requested it.  The bathroom had one of the best showers that we've experienced in the UK.  REN products were a really nice touch.  We found the lighting to be problematic in the bedroom and bathroom.  The bedroom lighting was too dark, even with the blinds up and all lights on.  In the bathroom, the light around the…"
March 2014,Best Hotel in London,"Booked to attend a business function at the Hilton Park Lane, and having found no availability at the hotel, we searched online for similar hotels in the London ""Belgravia"" area and stumbled across ""Belgraves"".  I have to say how pleased I am that we did.  Belgraves is quite possibly the best hotel we've ever stayed in, and without doubt the best city hotel.  A delightful welcome into tranquil, sophisticated and contemporary surroundings, once you enter Belgraves you could be anywhere in the world.    Upon arrival we were ""upgraded"" to a ""King Premium"" room, with a view of the park from the sixth floor - a great start to our hotel experience.  We found the room to be spacious, smart and very comfortable with all the amenities you would expect to find in a top quality hotel.  The…"
March 2014,Terrific hotel for work,"I recently stayed at the Belgraves for 5 days for work (meetings in St James and the City).  The location was fabulous for getting to meetings while still being in the wonderful, well-heeled neighborhood of Belgravia, especially for the price.  Given the hotel has been open for 2 years, I sadly expect the prices to increase soon.  The decor is a combination of classic and mid-century modern.  The lobby has a terrific bar on the mezzanine level, the gym was more than satisfactory and the only thing lacking was a spa.  The restaurant was great for breakfast albeit at London prices.  The staff was highly attentive and friendly at every turn, on par with any 5 star hotel in London (and I've stayed at most).  The rooms were really nice although maybe a bit small, but if you're…"
February 2014,Perfection in heart of the city.,I stayed here for one night for my husband's birthday on 3rd March. The hotel service was impeccable. We were given 2 room upgrades and the hotel staff went out of their way to make the evening wonderfu; providing champagne in the room and a compimentary birthday dessert. My husband and I live in London and regulary stay in city hotels through the Mrs and Mrs Smith website and once again Smyth have got a romantic city bolt hotel correct in their estimation. I would stay here time and time again. The staff and service are second to none - thank you very much once again.
February 2014,Modern Hotel with Excellent Staff,We were lucky enough to get this hotel from Last Minute's Secret Hotels.  From the minute you arrive the staff go out of their way to help you.  The décor is modern but not minimalist giving the hotel a lovely relaxed feel.  We had a room on or near the top floor which had two alcove seats from where you could watch the world go by and study the rooftops etc.  Very comfortable beds and all the usual modern trappings you would expect.  A nice shower room (no bath) clad in white/grey marble and a separate loo (something I prefer).  Great location for Knightsbridge and the Kings Road.  Would definitely return.
February 2014,Amazing service and beautiful hotel,"I spent 4 nights at the Belgraves for my birthday and the amazing service and staff just made it that much better.  Anytime we had any issues, someone would take care of it in a minute.  We have some noise in the room and immediatly after we reported it, we were upgraded to a beautiful suite.  The service is amazing, people are kind and helpfull. So much so that I even felt the need to call them after we got back home just to let them know how great our stay was.   I can't reccomend this enough."
February 2014,"Nice, pleasant stay","We stayed for a couple of nights mid-week.  A great location, a short walk from Knightsbridge tube station (although we noticed most visitors used taxi's!).  We had a room overlooking the small gardens opposite and had a pleasant stay.  I love modern hotels, I did find that the hotel was generally dark, the hallways, the lift and the room, someone with less than perfect eyesight may find this a problem.  The room facilities were good, although we had no water for a time on out last morning, although we eventually managed to have a shower.  We would visit again."
January 2014,Great Hotel,This is the third time I have stayed at this hotel and I have to say things are improving to a point of perfection enjoying two very nice days last weekend in a great part of London Great location complimented by a first class restaurant within 25 metres of the hotel ( The Palms)  Rooms excellent and very modern  Bar lively without being overpowering  Breakfast gives a wide choice and is superb  Staff are very responsive and provide good service
February 2014,Another great stay at Belgraves,"Have stayed here many times (including when it was the Sheraton Belgraves) and it is my hotel of choice in London. Boutique in design, the Belgraves delivers on all counts. Comfort and quality are great and the staff makes you feel like a special guest.  I recently spent a week there and felt at home from the day I arrived. The staff did all they could to meet my (significant) needs and did it all with a smile.  If you are in London, Belgravia is the area to be in and the Belgraves is the place to stay."
February 2014,"Bad start, but excellent service saved it","We were given a 2nd floor room right above the bar. It was very small, dark and there was no view. At 12am, we could still feel the bass from the bar, we called to complained and after the 2nd time they offered to move us to a higher floor and gave us a bigger room.  We were so disturbed (only slept at 2am) that we went out and bought another room at another hotel nearby. However, it must be said that the location of the hotel is excellent, rooms are very new and they have a nice bar. Ultimately we ended up staying for the whole time.   Avoid 2nd floor rooms above the bar, and the lights are very dim (they got extra lightings for us). The staff was very very polite and nice and responsive (remember when the newspaper I asked for wasn't available the next day).  Above all it's 5…"
December 2013,fantastic hotel,"We stayed here in February 2014 and had a lovely stay. The staff are all so friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble. During our stay, we had an issue with the bath taps, they sorted it out within 15 minutes. The bar area and restaurant are excellent with a very high standard of fair and service. I do feel that the rooms were a little small, but they are decorated so beautifully, that this was hardly an issue. My only complaint, and this applies to nearly every hotel I have stayed in, is that the mirrors and lighting for the ladies to get ready and apply make-up etc, are always seriously lacking. Too dark and lights always in the wrong place, so not directed just at this hotel. The hotel is well located too, we only had a ten minute stroll to Harrods. It rained a lot…"
December 2013,Great night,I was yesterday with a bunch of people the first time at the bar. First we where outside in the cigar terrace which was truly amazing. Afterwards we moved inside and I have to say many thanks to Abigail who looked after us so well the whole night. We will come back ! 
December 2013,A nice city brake,"What a lovely hotel, very smart. The rooms were cool and a weekend that was ment to impress most certainly did with this hotel. The day time bar tender didn't really know what he was talking about but drinks in the evening most certainly made up for it. Didn't eat dinner there but breakfast was good munch with a glass, or two, of champagne after a heavy night before. Easy to get to the main town. I would love to go back again. "
November 2013,Top,"Everything is good, welcome, front desk, porter, super friendly staff, smilling and ready to help. great room, clean well equiped and comfortable.  certainly one of the best hotel in london! Thank you I will be back"
December 2013,Back again,"Stayed again at the Belgraves while visiting my daughter and once again, felt very comfortable and happy with my stay.  The staff addressed me by my name immediately which is a big plus. My request for a room on a high floor was honored and I found myself in a quiet corner on the top floor--perfect!  I absolutely love the bar for a small salad in the evening with a drink beforehand so I was disappointed to learn that there was a private party scheduled the evening of my arrival! Had my drink in the lobby but really missed the tranquil ambiance upstairs.  Still my go-to hotel in London, eyes closed..."
December 2013,Saturday night treat,very nice hotel - everything spotlessly clean and the staff very helpful.  Breakfast very good and again staf very efficient. overall the hotel is beautiful - very modern.  But the room we stayed in was very small - a superior room with Kingsize bed - we had to shuffle around each other for space! We would stay again but definitely book a large room!
December 2013,First class,"We stayed here despite living in London - a night away from the kids with room service! I was incredibly impressed. The hotel has a lovely restaurant, great bar and incredible service: requests were dealt with incredibly quickly and efficiently and nothing was too much trouble. The staff from receptionists to concierge to doormen all care and go the extra mile. Prices for extras were reasonable given the location and quality. Its in a great location. As a London resident, I would recommend tourists to stay in this area rather than in Mayfair - everything is nearby (shops, museums, tourist attractions). It also appeared well equipped for business with good wifi and working area in the rooms. Excellent."
November 2013,Fun alternative to large chains,Usually stay at large hotels and tried the Belgraves.  Boutique feel with all the amenities. Room was small but with great layout. Convenient power outlets and good wifi for the business traveler. Very friendly and attentive staff. Restaurant had wide range of interesting options. Ceviche was outstanding
November 2013,A perfect experience,"It was on a total whim that we booked a night in this hotel for my wife's birthday.  (Thanks to the Impulse Deals on SecretEscapes.com. We arrived fairly late in the evening, although the bar was still open.  Being a little peckish, this was ideal.  Food options are amazing.  Service is prompt, but not in your face.  Food lives up to its description on the menu. Rooms are luxurious - from the bed linen, the toiletries, the thick fluffy towels to the glossy mags available in the in-room patio overlooking the square. We ambled downstairs the following morning, and were treated to a feast.  Great continental breakfast, and the cooked options are equally good.   One of the best omelettes I've had in a long time. There are so many distinguishing features to this hotel, but the art…"
November 2013,Stunning interiors,"This place attracted me with its interiors. The rooms really are swish. Marble clad bathrooms and smoked oak timber plus the most comfortable beds I've slept on in ages. The service was perfect everywhere from the door to the reception, the restaurant, bar and housekeeping staff stood out for their friendliness and willingness to help. I had a superb solo meal in the restaurant on the first night and was discreetly but so attentively served. Location is brilliant. Five minutes from sloane square. Highly recommended. "
October 2013,Perfect!,I've been in this hotel 2days ago.The staff was really kind and the room really clean with a great mini bar and a wonderful king size bed!!!!!I'm used to travel and in London this is the first hotel that I can recommend with no doubt!!!!!!
September 2013,fantastic night at the bar,"My friends and I had an amazing night at the Belgraves Bar.  The bar looks stunning, very stylish and classy.  First, we had some drinks on the outdoor patio, where we were served by this great italian waiter - Daniel. Unfortunately, the patio closed quiet early, so we had to move to the bar, which wasn't a big deal, because we immediately got another nice table, although they seemed very busy at that time. From there, we were served by this nice young lady Polia, always smiling and very courteous. She really took her time to recommend us a few cocktails, which were fantastic indeed! Later on, we ordered some food, which was a little bit disappointing. It was good, but just as good as any other bar food and a little bit too expensive. Afterwards, we wanted to buy some…"
October 2013,Great cocktails,"Went on a Thursday night with some fiends, for a quick nightcap, loved the place , great service and delicious cocktails ! i would defitnitely recommend the Belgrinni, really tasty and not too sweet .       "
September 2013,Rafael nadal can sure make a drink,"I have already written a review for this bar before, but I felt it necessary to write one again. I have drunk in many bars in London, but the bar at belgraves really stands out. The rafa nadal lookalike behind the bar made me a drink called the hot buffalo and it was amazing, just eh thing to pick me up. Can't recommend it enough. Thank you and I will see you again soon."
October 2013,One Night wasn't enough,"This hotel has blown my mind. Not only is the art and style of this hotel mod and sheek, it has the staff at the front to embellish it even further. Every contact with a front desk or the bell person was   just satisfying as they knew what I was looking for, or what I wanted or what I should be getting for that matter. They were very detailed oriented and paid attention to every ins and outs of that lobby.  I was upgraded for 1 night to one of their deluxe suites and my oh my... the room was unbelievable. The cleanliness, the details in fabric and light fixtures .... down to the coffee table ornaments were typical Thompson attitudes.   I did visit the Bar and terrace on the 1st floor... it was quiet but that's how I prefer my Martini and the Bartender gave me a few pointers for…"
October 2013,Top of  the line staff,"Front of the house personnel:    Sarah, Violetta, Camille and Magali;  Michael the bellman; everyone smiles; everyone has answers.  These people have been trained and trained well.  Room lighting was a problem; they brought in more lighting.  Air conditioner wasn't working that well;  an engineer was there in two minutes and when the equipment needed repair, they moved our room;  upgraded and immediate.  Rooms are on the small side overall design and service quality more than make up for  it. This place will be my new London hotel."
October 2013,"Great service, great drink list, great Bar!!!","I have been in the Bar at Belgraves just a couple days ago with some friends. The hotel looks amazing from the moment you walk in. We had a couple of drinks in the bar, and everything was great, lady that served us was very nice and polite with a smile on her face all the time, drink list is very good- everyone will find something good for them. I really would recommend!"
September 2013,home away from home,"I have been at Belgraves hotel many times, its Very cosy great hotel, staff is very friendly and helpful,they have amazing restaurant and bar you should try the burger at the restaurant its the best burger in town"
September 2013,Another Amazing Stay At The Belgraves,"Just had another 4 separate nights at The Belgraves.  What can I say, except to say, I was not disappointed again!  I booked my first night through a booking agency here in Australia and there was some confusion so immediately the Duty Manager called me in Sydney to rectify the situation and upgraded my room for the following weeks stay.  When I returned the following week, I again had been upgraded to a suite!  The staff are amazing and considerate, nothing is too much trouble for them.  Mauritzio, the Concierge is very accommodating and will go out of his way to help you with anything that you need.  The girls on the front desk are also fabulous, Cammie is my favourite though, extremely thorough and professional.  The boys at the front door to welcome you are also a nice touch…"
October 2013,Great experience!,"I have been at belgraves with my parents just a couple of days ago. It was a recommendation of one of my friends and I have to say it was amazing!! The staff was very friendly, specially the Italian waiter who served us on the terraces was fantastic in recommending drinks and cigars. The cocktails taste amazing and the atmosphere is very relaxing! All in all a perfect place to start or end a exiting day out in London ! Well done! We will be back soon."
January 2014,A bad experience,"A friend and I were enjoying a birthday treat in London, en route elsewhere we decided to enjoy a relaxing glass of wine in a nice environment, however our experience at this hotel was disappointing.  When we arrived at the bar there was no-one there to serve us.After waiting a while a lady arrived and took our order. There were no- other customers in the bar.  After waiting 15 minutes we had to return to remind her, our drinks arrived some 5 minutes or more later, but there was no apology.  Whilst the surroundings of the hotel were very pleasant, it was a shock to receive a bill for £27.00 inc 12.5% service when we had had no service at all, we will not be returning there for 2 glasses of wine at these prices and no service"
January 2014,Great Location,"Wonderful location.  This hotel has the nicest, friendliest people.  Great breakfast.  My room had a beautiful view.  I was upgraded to a bigger room but it was a handicapped room so the bathroom was kind of odd.  It is a good thing that I am not very tall.  Also, the lighting in the room was not great."
January 2014,Great hotel in Chelsea / Knightsbridge area,"Excellent smaller-sized hotel.  Rooms are a bit tight, but very nicely finished.  We were upgraded from Superior King and our room was beautiful!  Service is outstanding - you are greeted every time you enter or leave the hotel by all staff - and you feel their enthusiasm is sincere.  Lively and very cool bar area upstairs.  Did not dine at the hotel, so can't speak to that experience, but Belgraves is a very comfortable and friendly place in a great location in London."
October 2013,"Outstanding service, amazing view","It was difficult to pick the three best things about the Belgraves.  From beginning to end the service was outstanding. The room was very comfortable, maybe a little the small side (normal by London and New York standards) the use of mirrors and the amazing window overlooking West London gave the feeling of openness and space. We were on the 10th floor and the view was breath-taking at night. I would also highly recommend staying in one night and trying the room service, it was delicious, by far the most diverse menu I have encountered. The locations is central, walking distance to Sloan Square and Harrods.  The bar served great drinks and was packed on the weekend.  The gym was well maintained and offered 3 cardio options, a mat area, free weights and a multi-use weight…"
December 2013,Fabulous hotel,I stayed with my daughter at Belgraves back in October and had a fabulous stay.  The hotel is super nice and all the staff are extremely helpful.  We were upgraded to the King Suite which was so nice.  I would definitely stay here again
December 2013,great location,"- the hotel is super nice/ good taste -  in a great location - great views from the top floor - issues : not all the bathrooms in the standard rooms sea the same - the configuration of the bathroom in room 908 is non completely comfortable,  quite off!t he shower has a angle , so the actual area tos gower is quite small and narrow and dark! - the other room and i stayed before was different and comfortable -  this was the deal breaker for me  not sure if it is because of the fire place in the lobby to because of the smoking bar, but couple of days to smell of cigarette in the hallways was intense/ unacceptable  for a hotel listed as a non smoking hotel-- maybe someone was smoking in his/her room?  - staff is friendly and helpful  - continental breakfast is excellent, good…"
December 2013,"Stylish, Friendly and Great Location","We stayed at the Belgraves for New Years Eve and had a great time. The staff were helpful and friendly as soon as we stepped through the door. The rooms are very modern and stylish but also comfortable and inviting. The location was great for us, a short walk from both Sloane Square and Knightsbridge - there's lots of nice boutiques, restaurants and cafe's hidden here which is great. We spent a lot of the evening in the hotel bar which was fantastic! Great decor, super cosy and delicious cocktails. If you are staying here, be sure to check it out for a drink.  Belgraves is a fabulous and friendly hotel with lots of style."
December 2013,Super London Hotel,We stayed at the hotel in the run up to Christmas staying in their Penthouse suite which was very spacious separate lounge and dinning room which was very helpful. The suite had three bathrooms with fantastic views over the London skyline. In a nice quiet area walking distance from Knightsbrige shopping area and Sloan square. The staff were of the highest standard very professional and helpful we had a wonderful four nights at Belgraves and the food was suburb. A hotel I would recommend to high end travelers.
December 2013,Brilliant weekend at Belgraves hotel between Christmas and New year,"Had a lovely stay at the Belgraves Hotel for the weekend between Christmas and New Year.   We (2 parents, one 13y old son) arrived early on Saturday to drop off our luggage, and immediately received a very warm welcome by the friendly and efficient staff at the reception. This was an excellent way to start the day. The entire hotel is beautifully decorated, the lobby and lounge bar provide a cosy private club or even private living room atmosphere, the rooms are efficient and stylish.  The decoration of the entire hotel together with the staff genuinely makes you feel at home. After a day filled with shopping and sight seeing, we met with friends (2 parents, one 3 year old) who live in London, at the hotel and went for dinner in the hotel restaurant.  Not only was the food…"
December 2013,Fantastic hotel! Excellent customer service! A gem!,"How refreshing to find a chic hotel with excellent levels of service, comfort and dining that strive to make each customer feel special.  We can't wait to go back as we didn't want to leave.  It was all perfect from a Bellini in the lounge style bar (that was more like sitting in a gallery) to the most comfortable bed in very quiet rooms (even on New Year's Eve!). The Pont Street Restaurant provided the most beautiful brunch and the Cornish crab cakes Benedict were both creative and delicious.  Our lastminute.com gamble on an unknown hotel was not a gamble at all and gave us a beautiful memory of a New Year's break.  Thank you Belgraves Hotel. We will be back!"
February 2013,great weekend !!!!!well done,"have just returned from a great weekend in london staying at the Belgraves .The hotel was situated in a really convenient location ,we received a very warm and proffessional welcome.our rooms were ready early and we could unpack and get straight on with the shopping!!!!!!!the rooms were well decorated and clean with great design flourishes and lots of extra attention to detail to make our stay comfortable.the staff were all really helpful and we felt that nothing would be too much trouble!!!!even when i rang when i got home and realised that i had left something behind in the room !!!!! the cleaning staff had handed it in and it is now on its way back to me !!!! well done to all concerned!!!!   a great hotel !!!!!one to go back to !!!!!!!!"
May 2013,"Chic, Modern Luxury","Stayed in this hotel for two nights at the end of February, and was glad to have picked it. It is definitely a five-star hotel, without being stuffy.The service was fantastic, the staff were polite and attentive but not snobbish. The hotel has a nice atmosphere - it is trendy and chic - but also relaxed. Our room was clean, light and spacious (for London). It had an enormous shower with an overhead ""rainshower"" function, which was great.  Location wise it is around a 10 minute walk to the King's road so it is a great location but it is very quiet at night for central london. Hopefully we will be back soon!"
April 2013,Much too expensive compared to what you get....,"Stayed in this hotel for the first time this weekend and I´m not impressed.....  My husband came a day earlier and was told that his only card was not working (this card was used all over London the whole week....) When I came the next day I wasn´t even greeted before I was asked for my credit card to pay my husbands bill. (the other nights were prepaid) My husband felt treated like a criminal..  So to the hotel itself. Positives: Very good location, nice bar. Negatives: Tiny rooms, nothing extra (no coffee/tea etc), cheap quality small towels. Out of our three nights we had a turn-down service once! One evening (they came 18.30) we asked them to come back in an hour (they did not) and next evening they did not show up at all... This happened also to our friends in next room. …"
April 2013,top notch and exceptional,"We stayed for 5 nights,  I visit London frequently and I must say that this hotel is one of the best that I have seen in London. Staff is super friendly, the food is great and the hotel is super clean . had a wonderful time there !!"
April 2013,Last minute treat,"Stayed for one night after taking a last minute jaunt to London. The hotel is very plush, modern and vibrant. The staff were very helpful and friendly, especially the desk staff- though I did find being shown around the room a tad awkward as it wasn't exactly Narnia! We didn't bother with eating in the hotel as Knightsbridge is only a short walk. The hotel has a nice location but the rooms at the back of the building have a poor view and the room could do with a tad more lighting. I brought into the quirky, americanised, boho image that the hotel brand is pushing- not too forced but believable- the shirts and jeans uniform is cool and the Ralph Lauren furnished room was chic. Would I stay again? Probably. Would I recommend this hotel? Yes"
April 2013,Very charming hotel,"We stayed at Belgraves for the weekend and had a very pleasant stay. The staff were very helpful and friendly and made us feel very welcome. Although a 10 minute walk from the nearest tube, the location was very good, quiet and close to a lot of London attractions. The room was very nice and comfortable. Would happily stay here again and would recommend to couples."
April 2013,A good solid experience.,"We escaped to this hotel from another disastrous hotel experience.  We needed something nice and we found it. The lobby area was delightful - a beautiful orchestration of copper, deep blues and interesting seating. We were also very struck by the young women working on reception - they were friendly, helpful and chatty in a way not that usual in London. It was late in the evening, we were stressed and starving and they suggested the Pantechnicon, which was a stellar recommendation for excellent and reasonably priced food.  We were initially upgraded when we arrived.  This was for no apparent reason but was delightful nevertheless. The room was suitable for disabled users, which meant there was a shower curtain and grab handles in the bathroom, but this didn't bother us.  The…"
April 2013,"Great location, cool room, fantastic staff","We booked this hotel through Jetsetter.  When we arrived, we upgraded to a larger room with a bathtub and a view of the park.  The room was very nice, but we had trouble using the keycard to get in, and had to get assistance a few times.  When we checked out, the front desk staff waived the upcharge for the nicer room because of the trouble we had with the key.  It was the right thing to do -- but so many business establishments wouldn't think to do something like that.  I really appreciated it.  Aside from that, the location is in a gorgeous convenient area, and the hotel is lovely and elegant.  The rooms are small -- our friends who we traveled with complained about that -- but for the price and location, this didn't bother me."
April 2013,Unexperienced staff,"Me and my husband just got back from London. Our stay at the Belgraves was a wedding gift from a dear friend who lives in London. The area is amazing and the rooms quite nice (we had a King Superior) It was overall a good experience and the doormen were soooo kind and polite. The rest of the staff not as such though... The moment we entered the hotel, before they have even confirmed our reservation we were asked for a credit card. Find the reservation first and THEN ask for the card (our room was prepaid anyways) And the only thing I asked the concierge was never done. I have booked an airport transfer myself online, and I just asked him to give them a call later to confirm it, and just let me know if it was ok. All this in written directions. He just didn't do it. He did not…"
March 2013,Charming Hotel and Staff,"The Belgraves is a very nice hotel located in one of the nicest areas in the city. The staff is just fabulous!!! extremely warm and welcoming and suuuper friendly!!! They made our stay very pleasant and helped my boyfriend organize the BEST surprise for our anniversary which turned out into a proposal!! The room are very nice and comfortable with a nice view on sloane street and cadogan square, especially from the top floors.  The only problem in this hotel is the internet. Not only is it not included in the room rate but it is also a hassle to log into it. You have to log-in every time you go in and out of the hotel and enter a username and password that are sent to your email.  Why make your customers go through this? Even Starbucks offers free Wi-fi nowadays! I will…"
February 2013,Redefining Hospitality,"Upon arrival we were greeted and addressed by name by the Doorman. We entered the Lobby and were impressed by the design and the great manners of your Bellman. Instead of standing, while waiting, at a counter to check in, we were shown to be seated area where we could wait confortable to be checked in.  The Bar is stunning serving great cocktails. The room on the 8th Floor with breathtaking view of the city We stayed for three nights. in that time, all our requests were met by your phenomenal Concierge Maurizio: nothing was too much trouble for him he was very helpful, polite and efficient. The restaurant and the hotel in general was first class but it is the little touches that you get when staying in this hotel that makes your stay so memorable and special. and he really made…"
August 2013,"Good, but the devil is in the detail!","Won a stay at Belgraves through Mr and Mrs Smith and so went with high expectations.  First impressions were great, we arrived early and so our room wasn't ready - not a problem as we checked in anyway leaving our bags  and set off to see the sights. Staff were helpful, making sure we had everything we needed when we checked in and directing us to the nearest tube station (about five minutes away in Sloane Square).  When we got back everything was ready for us and we were shown to our room. The room was good and all we expected from a high end boutique hotel. Great view looking over London towards the river - St Paul's, The Eye, The Shard all in view. Now the first criticism - excellently stocked mini bar including some pleasurable items from Coco de Mer but no tea and coffee in…"
July 2013,Great stay,"London is last leg of our Europe holiday and I must say that it ended with a bang with our stay at Belgraves.  Belgraves is a small luxurious posh boutique hotel. Very conveniently located (nearest station is either Knightsbridge or Sloane Sq, about 5-7mins walk). Staff members made a load of difference -  always welcoming and quick to ask if we need anything.   The room is of good size with contemporary and stylish interior design. My only gripe is that the lights are bit dim. The bed is totally totally comfortable which is so important after a long day out. The bathroom is great and the amenities are sufficient.  By the way, the hotel is near to Harvey Nichols and many other luxurious brands. Another plus point.  Will definitely recommend it!"
July 2013,"Bar at Belgraves, a good time had by all.","My friends were taking me out for my Birthday, and they brought me to the belgraves hotel bar, which is a very stylish bar indeed.   the staff recommended we sat around in the snug they called it. a great place for small group.  the staff were excellent and efficient. the selection of whiskeys were among the best i had seen, and several of them went down beautifully.  the onion and balsamic popcorn they give out was amazing, the truffle one were not im afraid to say.  All in all a lovely little bar and i will be returning, mainly due to the friendlessness of the waitresses."
July 2013,"Liked everything about it, and will go back soon.","My wife and I stayed at Belgraves last weekend while passing through London.  We had stayed in (and liked) the prior hotel at this address, but had not come since Belgraves opened.  This is an excellent, thoroughly modern hotel whose staff members are cordial, capable, and eager to provide go service.  On arrival, we needed a good bit of assistance, which desk and lobby staff provided promptly.  Things worked as they should throughout our stay.  Our room was altogether comfortable.  We had a pleasant view of Belgravia Square.  We ate two breakfasts in the hotel, both excellent and both well served.  London is never inexpensive, but Belgraves' prices seemed fair to us, and consistent with the market.  We will go back soon."
June 2013,Unexpectedly cool,"Stylish and sophisticated in this previously staid corner of Belgravia, this Hotel covers all the bases. The rooms are chic and sleek. The interior design is contemporary yet comfortable. The beds are sleep inducing and I cannot wait to come and stay again. Breakfast was delicious too, by the way. I have never seen such an extensive menu at that time in the morning! Welcoming staff for whom nothing is too much trouble."
July 2013,Loved the Hotel,"Let me start with saying i LOVE Thompson hotels  and the Belgraves was no exception. Wonderful ambiance, the entire staff was very nice and helpful, room service is typically quick, fun bar/lounge upstairs... food was delicious weather it was room service or in their restaurant.  Everyone greets you hello and is quick to ask if you need anything.  It's a little bit of a walk to the tube (closest is Knightsbridge) but it's in a great location, pubs around, lots of great (expensive!) shopping. Loved the electronic blinds and they do a wonderful turndown service.  Would stay again and they definitely add that nice personal touch during your stay. Would definitely return."
June 2013,Their Staff May My Stay,"Having stayed at hotels around the world, I'm often surprised by the lack of interest that many hotel staff show in their customers and in their profession. No such problem at Belgraves, the team from the front desk, restaurant, bar and events team were amazing - great personalities, top of their game.  The hotel was comfortable, well set and felt like home. I was there for a meeting and we couldn't have asked for more from the events team. Thanks to everyone for making our stay memorable."
April 2013,"Great location, everything else is average","4 point review: -You cant beat the location, right in the center of town a short cab ride from victoria and a short walk to Hyde Park.  -The rooms are small (even by city standards) and I was quite surprised by how low the ceiling is! The bed is comfy and there is really nothing else of note in the room. No tea/coffee maker  -The service levels are good, I do think they did get stuck in between trying to seem very young & funky and at the same time keeping up traditional standards of service. Dont think they have got their act together yet - One annoying bit, everytime I ordered room service the would commit for 20 minute delivery time (which is very fast) but would end up delivering in 30-40 minutes which is normal. Why make the promise if you consistently fail?"
June 2013,Good job,"I stayed at Belgraves for one solid week in April for an event. I also booked some friends there at the same time for greater convenience. They gave me a great room with a view, the service was excellent. It's got a buzzy hotel lobby with switched-on staff. While they showed me no price flexibility, they really delivered the goods and I would be happy to go back. Unbeatable location, minutes from Sloane street."
March 2013,Top dollar location...shame about hotel,Stunning location...just behind eaton sq not far to harrods....elegant boutique type of place...trendy...porters wear ranch hand type of clothes...nice staff at reception.....room very nice but dark...down lighters had been blanked over making it impossible to get made up etc....window blind wouldn't stay up which didn't help light situation...shower door made terrible cracking noise...very alarming...no tea/coffee facilities ...no water provided after first night...room not turned down on second night and not even made on day three...window would not shut...keeping you awake at night...wifi £15/25 per day...please we are in 21 st century....bar shut sat night for private function...the only bar....no breakfast included..grand total £1454 for a bed....how can they justify…
April 2013,Wonderful find!,"We recently spent several days at this hotel and it was thoroughly enjoyable for all of our family members, ages 17-55. The staff was warm, friendly and knowledgeable, the atmosphere was sleek yet warm, the neighborhood a quiet London gem."
April 2013,Excellent Hotel at reasonable rate,"Coveniently located in a quiet area of Knightsbridge. Close to tubes stations, Kings Road Sloane Street and Harrods and Harvey Nichols. The staff were friendly. Loved the bathroom. The lighting was too poor for reading but the staff immediately put in an extra lamp for us."
April 2013,Superb,"I can only agree with many of the other reviews about this hotel, it sets standards of service that you will struggle to find anywhere else...at any price.  When i booked i mentioned that it was for my wifes birthday, which was obviously taken note of as they had kindly left a delicious personalised birthday cake and a bottle of champage in our room.   The room itself, a Thompson suite, was on the 10th floor and afforded us magnificent views across London. It was very tastefully decorated, and the bathroom was big and luxurious.   The staff were fabulous at every level, and we were always addressed by name whenever we entered or left the building...which is always a very nice touch.  We found the location to be really convenient for us, it was a few minutes walk from some great…"
April 2013,"Average Hotel, Wanna Be Hip, in a Great Location","My business partner likes this hotel very much, to the tune of staying about 100 nights per year.    He likes the location of the hotel, smack in the middle of the nicest residential area of London, relatively quiet, but with easy access to close by luxury retail, good restaurants, etc.    It is the old Sheraton that was bought out by Thompson Hotels, and redesigned to be hip, now attracting a bunch of hipsters hanging around the second floor bar in the late evening.    Hipsters reject the culturally-ignorant attitudes of mainstream consumers, and are often be seen wearing vintage and thrift store inspired fashions, tight-fitting jeans, old-school sneakers, and sometimes thick rimmed glasses.  For me, I have had bad experiences at the hotel but I am assured by the young,…"
April 2013,Hotel Excellence,"This hotel sets standards that others should look to follow! Israel, our doorman was just wonderful from the moment we arrived and greeted us by name each time we returned. All other. Front office staff always had a friendly and genuine smile for us as we walked by and couldn't have been more helpful. The decor on he lobby, bar, corridors and rooms is warm and inviting, and the rooms are both superbly appointed and very comfortable. Food and service in the restaurant was also outstanding though the decor was not as inviting as the rest of the hotel. Frankly that didn't matter as the food and service more than made up for it. This hotel is the best I have ever stayed in and I can't recommend it highly enough!"
March 2013,Better than home away from home,"We would come back to the hotel after going out and be greeted by the doorman who remembers your name.  This hotel is taking the concept of service to a new level.  Every aspect was spot on.  The rooms are new, modern and tastefully decorated. How good is this hotel?  I was sad to leave because all the people working at the hotel treated us like friends not clients."
February 2013,"Great experience, most helpful front desk and concierge","Awesome experience the moment we got out of the taxi to the moment we got our bags to leave London. Very helpful, pleasant doorman.  We added a member to our party mid trip and changed rooms; they couldn' have been more accomodating or helpful in the move.  The room was clean, mattresses firm, plenty of pillows, good temp control.  The room had a nice little sitting area, large windows overlooking a little park.  WIFI was pretty good, easy to plug in US power cord.   Sabin at concierge desk was super proficient giving advice, making dinner reservations.  And another member of the front desk saw us on the Eurostar to Paris and spent 30 minutes to provide a detailed itinenary of must see/eat places in Paris.  She couldn't have been sweeter and her recommendations were spot on. …"
June 2013,Defining Hospitality!!,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Belgraves, a Thompson Hotel and I wanted to share what a wonderful experience it was.  Everyone there, from the front desk staff to the concierge, to the bartender made me feel welcome from the moment I stepped through the door.  As someone who travels extensively for work, Belgraves is now my home away from home when traveling to London.  The location as well is perfect for walking, window shopping, dining options and just enjoying the neighborhood."
June 2013,Boutique possibly at its best,"I stayed at the Belgraves last week for work and thoroughly enjoyed my stay based mainly on the service provided by the staff. Upon check-in, I was provided with a thorough description of the hotel's amenities and benefits in a way that encouraged me to feel very welcome. I even received a follow up phone call about 30 minutes after check-in to confirm that everything in my room was to my liking. Throughout my stay, I was greeted by my last name and asked about how my day was going or if I needed any additional assistance.   The room itself had all of the little touches that you would expect at a great hotel, including an fine REN toiletries, high threat count towels and bedding. The wifi and in-room technology (tv, stereo, lighting) worked consistently without fail and was…"
June 2013,Excellent Choice in Prime London Area,"This is a very nice hotel in the Westminster area. Clean, modern & efficient. Comfortable rooms, however, are rather sparsely appointed. Convenient to many embassies, Hyde Park & government offices. Top notch restaurant (reviewed separately). Good breakfast. Great staff. "
May 2013,Fantastic Hotel,"Having stayed at the Roosevelt in LA and The Thompson in NY, I know this chain, so was keen to try The Belgraves.  I booked directly from Sydney and spoke to a delightful French girl called Camille.  She was the first person I met when I arrived at 6am on a Wednesday morning.  From the moment I walked into the hotel, nothing is too much trouble for this groovy, young, but very professional group of staff.  Everyone remembers your name from reception, down to the young guys at the main entrance.  The two young waitresses in the bar are just a delight and everyone has a really friendly demeanour about them. I opted for the Deluxe room and wasn't disappointed, although I stayed in one with only a shower for the first week, the second one had a bath, which I preferred.  My room had…"
June 2013,Perfect Hotel,"We really enjoyed the stay and every detail of the hotel. The hotel is located very central and close to almost everything, but situated at a calm spot. I can fully recommend the hotel and the location."
September 2013,wonderful week at Belgraves,"Greeted with smiles by everyone,my husband and I felt welcomed and comfortable from Day 1.Concierge and staff made arrangements,suggestions and gave info that made our week flow flawlessly. Delightful morning breakfast started our day of sightseeing and we returned to the Belgraves to relax in the stylish lounge over drinks and enjoy wonderful nights sleep. The quiet elegance of Belgravia added to the overall atmosphere. The staff's attentiveness, professionalism and friendliness truly made staying at Belgraves and our week in London memorable."
July 2013,Excellent stay,"This hotel delivers excellence in every area from friendly staff  especially doormen who clearly take pride of the hotel and always greet you by name. Well appointed rooms, superbly cooked and present meal if you choose to dine at the hotel. I would happily stay here again!"
August 2013,its a starting hotel fantastic location but can do better still,"We loved our experience at thompson les NYC, so we continued our trip to london in the same brand but unluckily management was different at london. Location is fabulous, super chic, between embassies. elegant, classy. walking distance to the parks and major attractions. beautifull to just go out anywere and walk.  Hotel decoration was cool, trendy, brand new. restaurant and in room dining very poor. sugestion a kids menu or healthy option not a friendly hotel for travelling with babies. though staff was allways super friendly there is not ramp for stroller and elevators are really small and no kids menu. its more a couple or friends going out hotel not for business neither as internet never worked in room in the whole week we stayed. Not even the payed expensive internet. My…"
September 2013,Wonderful Stay at Belgraves,"Normally I just use these sites to read the reviews but wanted to add my comments, Stayed at the Belgraves in a King Suite for a week with a small child, Hotel is excellent, modern, stylish but still family friendly. Staff was exteremly courteous and friendly. Cannot beat the location in a very quite and charming area but perfectlt situated in central London. Rooms are a bit on the small side but that was expected for central London. However, all rooms were beautifully furnished. Suggest booking the King Suite for a bit more room. I will definetely return and they made my London trip very special. Thanks Belgraves!"
September 2013,A gorgeous stay in a fabulous place,"What gem of a place. I wanted nothing more than a good night's sleep and I have to say I was blown away by this hotel. Amazing design coupled with a team of fabulous staff. Woke after a tremendously welcome sleep thanks to great comfy bed and gorgeous linen to the best view of London - ask for a high room if you can. The luxury detail here is worth every penny. If you're after a good design / boutique experience in a great part of town - book here.  Great bar too, great vibe. Thanks Belgraves."
September 2013,"Fantastic Stay, We Will Return","With little notice we decided to take a short break to London and after reading a review in Conde Nast Traveller decided to book The Belgraves Hotel.  This turned out to be a great decision!  A small boutique hotel, in a great quiet neighbourhood, very cool, smart, clean and welcoming.  Our room was small but very nice with everything we would possibly need. We found the staff to be very accommodating and genuine in there commitment to ensuring we had a great stay. Particularly when we went down for breakfast were the service was excellent and the young manager was all over the service ensuring everything was spot on, which it was. We had room service, which again was excellent and prompt. The Porters were pleasant and helpful and dealt with our car effortlessly.  Only slight…"
September 2013,Place to be visited by all,"I just moved near the area and was pleasantly surprised when I visited the Belgraves bar. I was warmly welcomed by a waitress and was well looked after for the night by ""Abegail"". I was unsure of what drink I wanted but Abegail recommended that I try a cocktail and to help me with my decision brought I few tasters which I highly appreciated. After my delicious cocktail I decided to sit at the bar where again I was well looked after by ""Pavel"" who was very knowledgeable and continued to serve me superb drinks. Overall I had an excellent evening which I didn't expect I'd have and ill defiantly be returning again very soon and spreading the word."
August 2013,A gem with some mini flaws,"The Belgraves is a gorgeous updated modern small boutique hotel that we could love if not for a few flaws.    At this price range we should not have to plug our hair dryer into the outlet in the bedroom and use the mirror over the bed.  The restaurant tries hard but the service is slow and the food is just adequate at breakfast. And, we'll even forgive them for the total technology breakdown of the day as this can happen to anyone. Finally,  unless you're 200+ lbs, you will need help to open the sticky front door. Lol. Staff are helpful and attentive at all times. We would go back as this hotel is close to everything  'downtown'."
August 2013,"Yes, this is a good one","I usually don't really bother about reviewing places... but I must admit that I use this website to get a feeling of places I stay at. Well, I thought, this time, instead of always using without giving back, I'll do the right thing. So, here it goes: The belgraves is a beautiful hotel. If you like to stay in cosy, nicely designed places, as I do, this hotel is for you. Gorgeous ambience generated by judiciously chosen ambi-light, nice palette of colors, select furnishings, wood under your toes, marble bathroom. I loved it. Go for the king premium. The staff is tip top, nice and smiling, as it should be but rarely is. The location is fantastic. The restaurant is good too if you don't want to move too much, but really, why wouldn't you move? this is London! My feeling as I left…"
July 2013,A fine stay,"It was a last minute decision and not sure if it was the right one.  However, upon arrival our expectations were satisfied and s igh of relief that we did make teh right decision.  The studio suite we stayed in was wonderfully spacious enough for our toddler girl to feel at home and the bathroom was excellent.  What I liked was the two cubboards so my wife and I didn't have to share.  The amount of light in the morning coming into the room once the blinds were opened is welcoming and the view is marvelous.  The location of the hotel is very convenient as well as peaceful.  Everyone was friendly and helpful.  All in all a very pleasant stay."
March 2013,At home in Chelsea,"The Belgraves is one of these really nice surprises, unique in its genre, located where you would expect it the least. It has the personality of a Kensington trendy hotel with the luxury of a Mayfair palace. Our room was a Junior Suite over looking the small private park. We loved the bathtub enclosed in glass and allowing you a peak at the city. The location is ideal for those who want a proximity to every tourist attraction but want the feeling of retiring to their residential neighborhood at night. The food was great. Indian and Continental flavors on the menu. A hype bar, busy but not overcrowded. And a short stroll to Amaya, our favorite Indian 1 Michelin star restaurant. A final touch is the cool looking doorman / butler, always ready to fetch something for the kids in a…"
March 2013,Beauty at The Belgraves,"My husband and I recently spent a perfect night at The Belgraves. We loved the location of this hip little gem - easy to walk, cab or tube to many great dining options as well sight's and shopping during the day.  We loved how the neat little location made it feel like we were living as locals in a chic London neighborhood.  We'll definitely be back on our next visit to jolly'ole London and will recommend this hotel to friends and family!!"
June 2013,"great hotel, friendly staff and good food","I recently stayed at the Belgraves and had a wonderful stay. From the moment I checked in the staff were very friendly and welcoming. It is a very modern hotel and the bar was really buzzing when we had a drink before dinner. The food in the restaurant was also excellant, just a shame the restaurant was a little quiet. I would really recommend this hotel."
June 2013,Hotel Excellence,"Belgraves is a perfect example of excellence.  From the crisp, clean and contemporary decor through to the clear customer orientated team, we can highly recommend.  My husband and I visited recently for a weekend to celebrate our wedding anniversary and it was a fantastic experience from beginning to end.  The staff are very friendly and personable without being insincere or intrusive, this balance can be difficult and they had it just right.  The suite was perfect.  The space was nicely laid out, plenty of room to move around, the views through two aspects were incredible and the bed very comfortable."
July 2012,"Funky hotel, young staff, great location, small rooms","Ive stayed in this hotel on business and for a romantic anniversary. For business I wouldn't really recommend it but otherwise it is a great hotel with the following benefits: - incredible location  - good value for its proximity to things - friendly staff - views are nice if you ask for the higher floors - funky hotel lounge/bar with a great outside terrace - good food at hotel restaurant/room service  Disadvantages: - rooms are small (dont be fooled by the way they name each room. i.e. standard room is called ""King Superior"") - they charge for internet!!! - not very generous (we were celebrating our anniversary and they had promised to take care of us, i did not get an upgrade nor any gift, bottle of wine, roses, chocolate, nothin!!) - they add service charges on your final…"
May 2013,Fav hotel in London!,"After staying in hotels all over London this is my very, very favorite! I love the small cozy feel of this hotel and its rooms.  The hotel is also located in Belgravia, which quickly became my favorite area of London.  Belgravia is not only beautiful on its own (surrounded by gorgeous white homes, unique boutiques, cute little restaurants), it is also just a quick walk to Knightsbridge (where Harrods and other high-end shops are located) and Buckingham Palace.  The rooms are a bit small (typical for Europe), but very comfortable....and not to mention, the bathrooms are gorgeous. Also very clean and new rooms...felt like an American hotel with a European soul.  Everyone at the hotel was very helpful -- great at recommending restaurants and activities.    Quick tips:  1.…"
May 2013,"Small, but Well Appointed and Luxurious","After many years of staying at the St. Martins Lane, I decided to give the Belgraves a chance, given that it is close to my office.   I was surprised by just how small the property was when I arrived, but what it lacks in size, it makes up in service and comfort.   Tucked away in the middle of upscale Belgravia, the location is short walk from Sloan Sq. and Victoria tubes, as well as a number of cute neighborhood bars, restaurants, coffee shops and pubs.  The service here was extremely warm and helpful.  There is always someone around to help you and they are on top of their game without being too overbearing.   The standard rooms are small, but typical by London standards.  I was impressed to see that they were able to fit in a sitting area, desk and queen sized bed while still…"
January 2013,My favourite London hotel,"I have been to London several times, but this is definately my favourite hotel now. The service is great, the hotel interior is stylish, but not too ""designed"" with a warm and friendly atmosphere. The location close to Knightsbridge and Sloane Square could not be better. And above all i never slept so good before. These beds are a dream! Thanks to the whole staff for a wonderful stay!"
March 2013,Nice Stay,Received a warm greeting and felt good energy here. Rooms were smaller than we expected.  Bed and linens good but towels a bit scratchy.  Room service was prompt but food was pretty bland and disappointing.  We would definitely stay here again but would need to upgrade to a suite to have the space to be comfortable.  Great location too!
February 2013,Bar Spectaculare,"I was at the Belgraves bar last Saturday night, and it appears it is the new place to be seen in London. Spectacular drinks, perfection of service (If you see the bar manager, a German guy who I think was called Marcus make sure you deal with him, he was vamazi) and a fantastic atmosphere with all the beautiful people.  I cant recommend the place enough, check it out."
March 2013,Good quality hotel and good service,"Very nice hotel and good location. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Good stay, I can recommand and price is ok for London. I spent 2 nights and my room was perfect. Taxis are outside mots of the time, very appreciable when you are hurry."
March 2013,Disappointing.,"The Belgraves is not a five star standard. The staff is friendly but rather unexperienced.  We made reservations via Tablet hotels, and thus didn't check out previous comments on Tripadvisor. Normally Tablet makes a great first selection of hotels that we usually totally trust. However on this occasion we would have been better off not blindly trusting. We requested a room with some extra floor space (for yoga practice) and a high floor (for the view). When we arrived our room was not yet free, so we got another room; not on a high floor, and just enough space to walk around the bed. When we asked to be changed to another room, we had the impression we were asking the world. Finally, when we got back from lunch, we did get the room we asked for, on a higher floor, with a…"
February 2013,Wannabe but long way to go....,"We are quite often in London but most of the time staying with some of our many friends in the City.  For once, we decide to book an hotel for a w-e.  We choose the Belgrave for his convenient location, because it looks special (non conventional) and we are always curious about new hotel.  Our first impression was really good as we had to cancel last minute our trip and the hotel was very kind to accept to postpone our booking to a later date - free of charges..  That was a very nice gesture from them, as we haven't a cancelation insurance in our booking.  We then choose another weekend and when we arrive, our room was not ready - we were a bit earlier than forecast - fair enough.  They offer us another room (same category - premium with king bed) on the sixth floor. That room…"
February 2013,Very enjoyable london weekend.,We had a sunday night at the Belgraves which turned out to be a great experience. The hotel is just a perfect size the for the staff to be friendly on a more personal level remembering our name etc. The hotel rooms are of good size for london hotels and was spotlessly clean with a well stocked mini bar. The lunch we had and breakfast were very tasty. Overall price wize compared to some more well known 5 star hotels the Belgraves offered good value for money. Only down side a 5-10 min walk to the nearest tube. 
February 2013,Good Quality Hotel and a High Standard of Service,"We've just spent the weekend at this hotel and it of a very high standard of room quality and service.  We had a room on one of the lower floors and everything was perfect.  My only gripe, (already dealt with by the restaurant manager) was the quality of the bread at breakfast.  I would definitely stay here again.  Its midway between Knightsbridge and Sloane Square tube stations or there are taxis right outside the door."
January 2013,"Excellent, by all means!","That was indeed an excellent experience. You can feel the difference from any other top-of-the-art hotel in London. New built, American style and attitude, very polite crew. I was there on a business trip and asked my wife to join me. The combination wouldn't work in any other hotel."
February 2013,Outstanding service!,"I stayed here with my friend to celebrate her marriage for a night.  The service really was excellent.  They couldn't have been more helpful and sent us a bottle of champagne to celebrate, which was a very nice touch!  I actually live in London and we were just staying for a treat.  The location is excellent - a very smart and safe area and close to Sloane Sq and Knightsbridge, which is great for shopping.  The rooms are small (but then that's London) but they had everything you could need and good toiletries.  We had a nice drink in the hotel bar and I would definitely return for a drink there on another occasion.  All in all I thought it was very good and good value when compared to some of the other prices of London hotels."
January 2013,Disappointing service,"I knew this hotel before it had been taken over by the Thompson group. It is fantastically located and we were thrilled to be staying there for a 40th reunion with close friends for the weekend. The main areas as well as the rooms seemed to be very poorly lit, the rooms were small and stifling. Despite the hotel being virtually empty, our request for interconnecting rooms was not granted (and would have cost an extra £200+ per night!). To switch from double beds to twin rooms was considered and upgrade and had to be paid. In summary, I get the impression that its not doing well, and trying to make as much money from those who book with them to offset losses. Their manager's people skills was absolutely abysmal! Training definitely needed I will definitely not be going back there…"
January 2013,Discrete and great value boutique hotel in Knightsbridge/Chelsea,"Belgraves is a recently re-furbished (I believe February 2011) boutique hotel occupying the site of the former Sheraton Belgravia (I think!). On arrival, the staff were totally charming and enthusiastic. My room was great - comfortable, spacious, stylish - everything looked and felt brand new. The gym was also very good and well-equipped. Location is Chelsea/Knightsbridge - around a ten minute walk to Knightsbridge or Sloane Square tube stations. The breakfast offering was a total disconnect to the rest of the hotel offering - poor quality produce and generally inferior - which needs to be improved. Barring the breakfast, I though Belgraves was great - ideal for the discerning traveller - and also excellent value compared to many four star hotels in London."
January 2013,Sublime weekend,"My wife and I have had the pleasure of staying in some of London's finest hotels. We discovered this beautiful and charming hotel through Jetsetter.com and will definitely be staying here again. Im not sure which room type we stayed in, my wife took care of that, but the room was luxurious, spacious, and emanated a sense of warmth. The small seated alcove near the window was superb.  The lobby which seems to be spread over two floors gave the same impression of warmth, luxury but also fun, with large Taschen photo books strategically placed.   To top this off, the staff and service was excellent, the staff were meticulous, from remembering names, not easy in my case, but also bending over backwards to make us feel welcomed and to see to our needs.   A fantastic hotel, I would…"
December 2012,great hotel,Spent a weekend in Begravres during January 2013. Hotel is new and well designed. the lobby the Bar in the first floor are very trendy. we booked a standard room which proved to be a little small. would go for the larger rooms next time.
December 2012,Very good hotel with a comfortable feeling,"Belgraves Hotel is a very comfortable hotel with good room sizes and great staff.  Brand new comfortable and homey rooms, One of the most comfortable beds I have slept in hotels. Location is 5 minutes away from Sloane square, Harrods or Kings road. Highly recomended."
December 2012,A surprise location in LONDON!,"I had the pleasure of visiting the Belgraves Hotel in Knightsbridge, London just before Christmas. The staff were extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the property and the area! The sales manager showed me various rooms at this prestigious location - which were all BEAUTIFULLY re-done. Not updated - but completely re-done to a 5 star standard! The Thompson Suite (at the corner of the building) has marvelous views even from the BATHROOM - believe, which is where I shall opt out to stay on my next (frequent) trip over to LONDON! The Belgraves is virtually a 5 minute walk to Sloan Street (compares to: Wilshire Blvd. - L.A.) and Knightsbridge High Street. Its a 10 minute walk to the prestigious Harrods and Harvey Nichols department stores. I understand that the restaurant will…"
December 2012,A great hotel!,Everytime i visit London i stay at the Belgraves Everything is perfect! The staff working makes you feel home they are great! The room are very nice& clean! The bar is trendy The location cannot be better Can't wait to go back Marc D.
January 2013,Great Design and Staff,"At first we were a bit apprehensive on account of some of the early reviews, but any concern turned out to be unfounded. We were given a brilliant corner suite which was thoroughly modern yet familiar and welcoming with lots of touches that gave the room a lot of warmth, especially the hardwood floors and a love seat and desk in two alcoves, separated by see-through curtains. The layout is inspired and truly practical and for London, the room is large. There were two massive built-in closets with enough room to accommodate a stay of several months. The staff were incredibly friendly, cheerful and knowledgeable. The one thing we noted was the hotel did not provide any free drinking water, but when we mentioned this on check-out, the water we had used from the mini bar was not…"
December 2012,the best lounge bar!,"wish to thank personally the director of F&B - ryan -   for a wonderful evening and congratulate him for an impeccable service and quality. This was one of the most exhilarating tasting experiences I have even had. Pavel (our mixologist for the evening) and Marcus really spoiled us and made our evening memorable.  The belgarves will definitely become my stop by place now to meet colleagues, friends and have my business meetings.  Thanks you again, we are most grateful for the hospitality your showed us and the absolute delicious drinks and snacks.  a place worth visiting!"
September 2012,A very lovely hotel,"We recently stayed at this hotel for two nights and it was a lovely experience.  The room was spacious for London and the finishing was beautiful, especially the floors and the shower, a delight.  The staff were so welcoming, enthusiastic about the product and keen to assist.  They were also very helpful and concerned when my husband became ill on our last day.  As someone else mentioned the location, while very central, is in a more residential area, so it is a bit of a walk to restaurants and the tube station.  I also wish there was complimentary water in the rooms.  This just feels a little mean, when everything else about the hotel is so generous.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and hope to stay there again on our next trip to London."
October 2012,"Great location, service and food","This hotel was great, we spent there 5 days with my family and the service was excellent. The hotel has great location, walking distance to Big Ben and other tourists' attractions. It is pricy but everything in London is pricey. The food in the restaurant was delicious, the breakfast is not included so you have to pay but again the food was very good so it is worth the price. Just do get continental breakfast, it is much better to order something from the menu.  There is nothing bad I can say about this place, everybody was very helpful and friendly to the point that when I had a migraine at 3 am and went down to front dest asking for some pain killers I was told they are not allowed to have any drugs at the hotel, but they can go to a pharmacy and buy some for me. I was so much…"
October 2012,Just perfect,"Attentive staff, well designed rooms, the room was 'pin drop quiet' and the bed was a bed 'to die for'.  Belgraves really does define a boutique hotel.  Combined with its quiet residential setting in one if the most beautiful sections of London's Belgravia, this hotel is great!"
October 2012,Cool ambiance and strong service; a couple small details missing for five stars,"I booked Belgraves via Tablet, and got a cheaper rate than the Thompson Hotels website, just as an FYI for other travelers. The hotel is very chic, with strong service. From the bell staff who met me at the cab to the front desk staff, everyone was very helpful (almost too much so - I only had a small bag and they insisted on bringing it up to my room for me). The rooms are well appointed, but as other reviewers have said, not all that large - although in line with other London accommodations. The bed was comfortable and linens fresh. Although small, I appreciated that the a la carte breakfast prices were not astronomical, and that there was actually a wide selection of a la carte items, even for the room service breakfast - you didn't have to buy a $20 meal. The two nits I had…"
September 2012,Nice hotel. A few glitches.,"Staying in the hotel tonight on a deal booked at hotel tonight.com. It's a nice hotel - previously a Sheraton (I stayed here before when it was in its previous incarnation) and the rooms are still very small but nicely refurbished.  Welcome on arrival was warm and friendly. My only big gripe so far is that the WiFi only works in the entrance area and the bathroom of my room! The moment instep into the bedroom area the WiFi signal just dies. Never had this before, and it's a big negative for the hotel as I was planning to do quite a bit of work this evening (I'm typing this review over the bathroom sink!). You'd think that they would have ironed out wrinkles like this before the hotel opened. I wouldn't be happy if the WiFi was free and I encountered this kind of problem, but the…"
August 2012,Wonderful Belgravia Boutique Hotel,"The entire Belgraves experience was wonderful. The staff was always helpul and friendly. The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. I loved the little extras, like the linen mat on both sides of the bed to step on at bedtime that was provided during turndown service.  The Concierge Service made our London experience delightful. Every morning we would purchase vouchers from the Concierge for the sightseeing experience of the day. I will stay at the Belgravia on my return to London. Loved it!"
August 2012,Nice boutique hotel in a good location,"This is a perfect hotel if you want the Knightbridge area. Less than 10 minutes walking to Slone St and Harrods, where you can also find the Knightbridge tube station.  The room (King Superior) was modern and nice.  I recommend this hotel and we will stay there again."
May 2012,A superb boutique hotel in Knightbridge area!,"Stayed in this rather new boutique hotel for one night. A really great experience! Location is very good, but still very quiet. The staff was very helpful and friendly, which is not always the case in this type of hotels. The interior is very stylish, but yet relaxed and informal. The rooms had wooden floors, quality furniture/lightning and great beds/bed linen! Good size bathroom, with separate wc.The hotel also had a nice bar/lounge area, with good atmosphere! Did not try the restaurant and fitness room. All in all a great experience and good value for money!"
August 2012,excellent stay and service,"stayed here for business earlier in the year and all was as pretty much ideal. the room was outstanding with upgraded room and amazing bathroom, very comfy bed and sitting working areas with extra windows - light and airy room. staff was very professional and helpful yet stayed out of the way. the 2nd floor bar area provided some fun and the smoking outdoor lounge aided those with a nicotine habit without bothering the non smokers. the neighborhood is upscale and yet totally chill. beautiful spot. many cabbies didn't know it had been upgraded from a sheraton BTW. so you may need to mention sheraton to get there with a cab. a great stay"
July 2012,Bravo Belgraves!,"My husband and I enjoyed a night at the National Theatre and decided to stay the night and logged onto to Hoteltonight.com and it gave us a choice of three hotels, Belgraves being one of them.  Well, what a joy! Thoroughly lovely staff, very attentive without being in your face all the time.  The interior is a fab mix of funky retro and traditional, with smooth lighting, giving it a very chilled and relaxed vibe. We had some yummy bar snacks and some very good Pinot Noir.  We stayed in a King Premium room, which was very slick and extremely comfortable. Bed to die for, it was like sleeping on a could! Room and facilities top drawer (although I always like a kettle in my room, coz I'm a tea addict, so I missed that), but I would say all in all a thoroughly great find and would…"
July 2012,My cup of tea,"Best of both worlds in terms of location - removed from crowds (quiet block), but a short walk to tube stations, shops, etc. Atmosphere is warm, friendly staff, efficient spaces.  Pictures and more at: http://www.drawn2style.com/london-part-i/"
February 2013,Pretty good,"We came just for a quick, last minute weekend trip and got a deal with Hotwire. Yes, it's true, the rooms are very small (we stayed in a King Superior, which is the standard room), and it's not super close to any tube stations. That being said, the location is still pretty convenient, the service was friendly, and the bed was super comfortable. We had some issues with the light switches, but the technician was sent up pretty fast to fix the problem. My one regret is that we didn't get to eat in the restaurant, which I heard is pretty awesome, or check out the bar."
February 2013,Great location,"my husband and I Stayed  at the Belgraves for 5 nights early February. At first we found the room dark,the ceilings low,the lighting was a problem.  Also we arrived on a Thursday night to a whiff of smoke coming from the bar...cigar smoke. it seemed to permeate the lobby and beyond.This in a proclaimed non smoking hotel. So it started off not on the best of notes,but good points of the Belgrade won us over. The location is amazing,the staff young and very helpful and accommodating...The room well thought out. The lighting however could  be worked on,couldn't just turn on one night table light..hard to get it out of dimmer mode...Frustrating. However,all in all we ended up liking the hotel,the superb helpful upbeat staff and its wonderful location ."
February 2013,Resturant !,"Me and my partner stayed in london on business for the last few days and it was our anniversary so we got a good deal on a meal at the resturant.   The food was amazing ! And thank you to the staff for being lovely and nice ! We are in our late teens, early twenties and when we go to fancy places the staff normal talk down to us. At the belgraves they did not.   A big thank you to Mathew who emailed the menu over instantly when I rang and organised everything. And to John who was our waiter and was warm and friendly.  We did go to the resturant on a Sunday night and it was empty. But still amazing. If your looking for an amazing resturant this is the place."
February 2013,Best ever,"Stayed here at  the beginning of February when I took my husband to London for his birthday. It was top class. The hotel is crisp and clean, the bedrooms are very spacious, the decor is superb, the staff were polite and attentive and made the stay even more enjoyable. Would recommend this hotel to anyone, I will be staying here again that's for sure."
December 2012,Chic boutique hotel in a great location,"What a wonderful stay we had here in London! Very centrally located, just 3-5 mins walk to Knightsbridge metro, and London cabs are always available throughout our stay. The hotel is tucked away at a quaint corner so there is no noises from traffic, pubs or crowds. There is also a Jeeves dryclean store and a Jeroboams (wine store) just across the road.  We were most impressed by the hotel's wonderful service staff - from the reception, concierge and the housekeeping team. The concierge team (by a very nice gentleman whom I cannot remember his name) helped us with lunch reservations at a very chic restaurant Hakkasan. All the staff was very friendly and could remember our names.  The room was very big and spacious, very well kept and very clean. Comes with Ren bath shower…"
February 2013,Boutique Chique,"This hotel is funky, modern and very cool. I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone visiting London. It's in a great location. We were visiting for a special occasion and champagne was left in our room which was a very thoughtful touch. Loved the window sofas!"
January 2013,super nice bar and great location,"the hotel is located only 1 min walk from sloane street ( harvey nichols / harrods on brompton road ) and sloane square which is close to kings road, both very nice shopping areas. the rooms are rather small but very nicely furnished and perfect for a weekend trip. i love coming to the bar upstairs which is a nice place to have a tea in the afternoon ( their tea selection and pastries are delicious ) or a drink in the evening. for people who are looking for a very lively hotel i would not recommend to stay here because it is rather small compared to the big chain hotels and very cozy. if you are looking for a bar where you can actually enjoy a talk and understand what the other person is saying then you will love this place, if you like a loud and vibrant atmosphere then better…"
January 2013,Little gem of a hotel.,"This was my second stay at Belgraves, a Thompson hotel in London. It once again exceeded all expectations and made my stay London as lovely as ever.  I prefer small, intimate hotels (am familiar with the Thompson hotels in NYC)  or atleast that feel like that with personal attention and accomodation. The staff here is wonderful and always aim to please. The rooms are gorgeous, contemporary yet inviting and warm, from the linens to the wall decor ( we had a great photograph of Julieanne Moore scantily clad) to the bathroom design I love it. The bar dowstairs ( above lobby) is also definitly worth seeing and having a tea or drink. We received an upgrade and had a beautiful view over Chesham place all the way to the Thames and had the privilage of seeing a gorgeous full moon light…"
January 2013,Great location and look forward to returning,"Nice hotel in great location. Would definitely return. Rooms are stylish, modern and very comfortable.  Bathroom was small but well designed with good shower  Helpful staff.  Bar was welcoming and breakfast was especially nice"
January 2013,Smiling Staff,Had a nice long weekend vacation with smiling staff and quality service.  Service at the front office and the Room service runs smoothly. We enjoyed the breakfast as well as the Bar. Smoking Terrace at the bar is appriciated by the smokers.
April 2012,lovely stay,"We were made to feel so welcome. It was our anniversary and we received a complimentary upgrade and champagne bought to the room.  the room was lovely, comfortable and clean. I love how the bathroom lights can turn blue so that in the middle of the night you dont have to turn the light on. so clever and would be great in all hotels.  To put it simply we had a lovely stay, and would definitely stay here again.   I appreciate how special they made us feel."
March 2012,nice hotel,we stayed at the belgraves for one night and found the hotel style quirky yet contemporary in design the staff were great and couldnt do enough ...the only thing that needs to be taken into consideration if staying here is the shower ...if you are friends or family i could imagine there would be an embarrassing situation when showering !! the walk in shower is literally a clear glass screen visable in the bedroom apart from that we just loved the whole vibe and decor and those small finishing touches
March 2012,A pleasant stay,"Belgraves is perfectly located for any business or leisure trip, a short walk to Knightsbrige, Sloane Square, South Kensington or Hyde Park.  The service is very friendly and welcoming and the staff always available.  The concierge is particularly helpful for any last-minute request.  The hotel is nicely furnished, lively at night and the restaurant worth trying.  The only drwback is the small size of the rooms which can become quite boxy if staying for many nights."
March 2012,"Less than i expected, more than i bargained!","With high expectations and an inner need to feel relaxed and peaceful, we arrived at the hotel and immediately a crisp air of design and attention to detail blew us away. Since it was our anniversary, we were upgraded to a King Premium (from a King Deluxe), quite a welcome touch. Complimentary continental breakfast was included in the package, but more about breakfast in a while.   One point i wanna stress out is the fact that service is like any other. Everyone was extra polite, going the extra mile so as to satisfy any requests, most of the times before they were even expressed. So, many thumbs up for the best service we have experienced.   The hotel in question is completely renovated, something you cannot tell unless you focus on the exterior, which according to the hotel…"
March 2012,Nice updates but not what was expected,"We have stayed at this hotel in the past when it was a Sheraton and decided to try it again under the new brand as we really like the location. This hotel has gone through extensive renovations and is very nicely updated.  Before booking I emailed to confirm the Deluxe Double room could accommodate a family of 3 traveling together and was told it would be perfect for us it had two queen size beds.  Upon checking in we were disappointed to see it had two single beds, when I asked about this I was told I could upgrade to a suite for an additional £300 per night.  I declined.  The shower is a glass enclosure fully visible from everywhere in the room and offers no privacy making for an awkward situation when traveling with teenagers.  Although I will return to this hotel with my…"
March 2012,Great from start to finish,"From the time my wife and I walked through the large wooden front doors we were in awe... a fireplace burning, the bellman was eager to welcome us and a warm and inviting check in that took a little too long but the girl behind the counter couldn't have been nicer.  The staff were attentive throughout our stay (especially at concierge desk).  The rooms are very spacious and well appointed, especially the large bathroom with a great bathtub over looking the park. We had drinks at the bar which also took a while but well worth the wait.  Overall, great location with warm and friendly staff that made our weekend one to remember.  We will definitely go back!"
February 2012,Belgraves,"I want to preface this by saying that we received an e-mail saying that this hotel was suitable for families. We arrived and they had trouble checking us in but the staff was very good and we were given free drinks. Once we got to our room however, we realized that it was not family friendly. The first thing that we noticed was that it was two single beds, even though the e-mail said that it would be two queens. Next was probably the worst thing about the room and that was the shower. It was a two sided glass door. This meant that anyone lying in the beds or sitting on the couch could see the person in the shower. We eventually figured out that if all the lights were off in the bathroom and hallway all people could see was an outline. That was still less than ideal for a family.…"
March 2012,"Best location, lively","The Belgraves Hotel was opened on February the First, this year. Previously the Sheraton Belgravia, the asset has gone through extensive renovations. It was worth the wait.  The Hotel is comfortable, nice rooms, very good service and a reasonable price. We stayed there for 10 days and enjoyed it very much. The bed was superb. Have since recommended to friends and they, too, enjoyed. In contrast to the previous Sheraton, present owners have managed to inject a young and lively spirit to the hotel. The bar and restaurant are packed until late hours."
February 2012,Romantic and glamorous escape,"My wife and I stayed over the weekend. The location is great, just around the corner from Harvey Nichols, Harrods, Zuma, Kings Road, Hyde Park...The interior design is classy, intimate and subtle. The staff was very professional, helpful and dynamic. We loved our room, especially the bathroom with a great bathtub wrapped by the windows, giving a feeling of being suspended in the clouds...The energy in our room was very peaceful, we had a beautiful view on a garden. We shall be back, it's a great escape for a romantic weekend in London."
February 2012,Great boutique hotel in a wonderful location,"We stayed at the hotel a couple of weeks after it opened.  The hotel looked great -- very stylish and British modern.  We only had breakfast at the restaurant and it was tasty.  We had drinks at the bar on the second floor, which was cozy and a nice way to start the evening.  The rooms were fair-sized for London with good clothing storage.  The bathroom had a glass wall adjoining the bed which is ok for bringing in light but not good for privacy.  The bed, beddings and linen were all top notch.  There were a few issues to work out (check-in system a bit slow, hot water problem one morning, construction noise), but all the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  The location is amazing, close to so many things.  Would definitely stay there again."
February 2012,excellent service and friendly staff,"Stayed at the hotel over weekend. relaxed atmosphere and very helpfull staff.  rooms are little small but the staff makes it well worth staying here.  decor is good too, perfect location for business and pleasure that suited me well.  must mention Security officer who was friendly kind and escorted me to my room while i was back from party at night.  very professional staff and excellent atmosphere. will surely come back very soon  Al Sowail Bandar"
February 2012,Not ready as yet,Was recommended to stay disappointing hotel. Trying be different but Staff does not know what they are doing. Restaurant poor service. Lighting in rooms very dark at night.  I tried  to blow dry my  hair there are no nearby mirrors to see what u r doing. I took a shower no where in the bathroom to hang your bathrobe!
February 2012,Nice new hotel ..,Very nice decoration .. The staff are good .. I stayed on the hotel after two weeks from the opening .. The rooms are a bit small but they are nice .. 
February 2012,"Lovely Stay at The Belgraves, A Thompson Hotel","A lovely boutique hotel in the Belgravia area, London. I arrived on the opening day of the hotel opening on 1st Feb at 10am, We Received a very warm welcome by Nikkolas and the front desk staff, i booked a King Premium room which i did like when i walked inside.I was only there for a short 2 night stay with my wife and so gladly happy i chose the Belgraves, Room was very nice and cosy but small but i was satisfied, i chose the walk in shower bathroom as requested and my request was granted. Only thing was the bathroom was very small but then again you don't expect them to break it up and rebuild for you. Overall how the bathroom looked i was a satisfied guest. The Decor was very nice, The marble bathroom was nice along with the amenities. most of the time i used the room service…"
June 2012,New and well worth trying,"I was really impressed by this hotel. Everything smells new and the staff are just settling in, but it's a total WOW. Outstanding design, wonderful use of glass in all areas, and rooms that deliver everything you need when on business in London. Not cheap, but I am thinking of treating my wiife to a weekend there. It's special."
May 2012,$69 a day for Internet - and other ridiculousness,"Here's the deal with the Internet here.  There's a separate charge for every device - 15 quid per laptop, 7 per blackberry.  So if a couple each have a laptop and blackberry, that comes to US $69 a day just for internet!  Outrageous!  I protested and the front desk hemmed and hawed about how other hotels in London are the same way.  Baloney.  Finally I convinced them to give me a free code for my laptop, but I had to call every 24 hours and convince them again to give me a new code.  Almost as ridiculous as the $22 to launder a shirt and the glass shower that allows people in the room to watch you shampoo your hair.    This is the former Sheraton Belgraves, and the rooms are still Sheraton sized.  Ours had a view of the roof and was barely bigger than the bed -- nothing like the…"
June 2012,Dont book double rooms if you are a long stay guest,Booked into double premium as one of the previous guest stays. No where to put your luggage. Had to use the sitting area wit our suitcases. Not enough space to put shoes and other items. Bathroom light very poor in the not in the center so you light on one half of the sink area. We had very noisy neighbours who arrived very late at night . Sounded like more like a sex orgy going on.  Was concerned as the room is interconnecting.    Would I come again questionable when there are similar hotels with better facilities. Doormen excellent they welcome you with a smile to the hotel. Reception staff always on the phone with little eye contact witht the guest.  Concierge Max french guy hardly knows London must have been hired for his looks. Half the time he cannot understand what you…
May 2012,The Staff Make Belgraves,"I have just returned from a 3 night stay at Belgraves and cannot praise the staff highly enough.    For me the stars of the show were a lovely, blonde Polish waitress who served me lunch on one day and dinner on my last evening, she was attentive and a total professional. So she may recognise herself in this review I want to say that I told her about a wedding I am due to attend in Poland in June and she told me all about the amazing restaurant in Shoreditch which is part of the same chain.  The other stars were the eternally cheerful and attentive doormen who really did make you feel welcome after a day of London pavement pounding and the delightful female concierge who saved  my life by checking me into my flight the night before I left and printing out my boarding pass.   …"
May 2012,Loved The Belgraves,"We were only there for one night, but wished it could have been longer.  I had booked the hotel quite some time ago through the website and had a prepaid rate for a deluxe king room. We were surprised when we checked in they had upgraded us to one of their corner suites. The staff and Nicolas, in particular, couldn't have been more accommodating. They got us into a restaurant that was impossible to get into and made our arrangements for our transportation to the airport in the morning, without hesitation.  The room, we thought, was beautiful. Yes, the lighting is a bit tricky and could be brighter, but all in all, we loved the room.  The marble bathroom was gorgeous and very light with all the windows and loved the shower. The location of the hotel is superb.  A short stroll to…"
May 2012,"Very nice staff, tiny and unpractical room","The hotel is newly opened so the reception, restaurant and rooms are fresh and modern. Nice design and colours.  I had a room with a double bed but would not call it a double room. I'm happy that I was travelling alone as it would not have been space for two people. It was hardly enough space to open the suitcase. The room had a big wardrobe which was a waste of space as the wardrobe doors hit the bed and could not be opened properly.  The room was very badly lit. I ended up removing the lampshade so I could read in the bed. I normally don't have any problems with my sight.  There was no kettle in the room so tea/coffee had to be ordered from room service. I tried it one day and it was delivered quickly.  Nice and well functioning bathroom.  There is no breakfast buffet in the…"
April 2012,Fantastic New Hotel,"We booked this hotel for a night's stay for our honeymoon through Hotwire and were blown away by the service we received. The staff in the hotel went out of their way to make sure that we had a great stay and upgraded us free of charge as we were on our honeymoon.  We stayed in a deluxe double room which was trendy, clean and comfortable and just what we were looking for.  The food in the Hix restaurant was top notch and they even gave us a free cocktail for being newlyweds.  Can't fault this hotel for a couple of any age but equally we wouldn't hesitate to take our young daughter there either."
May 2012,"Nice overall, but...","... this hotel has the potential to be much better value for the money. As it is, Belgraves is in one of our favourite parts of London, a beautiful quiet area close to so much that we like, Sloane Square, Saatchi Gallery etc. So Belgraves is a winner in terms of location. It's also a winner in several other areas: the staff are great, and the concierges, one French, one Italian, are superb: they're cheerful, knowledgeable, and go the extra mile to help, in almost any language it seems. The doormen are ubiquitous and attentive, the front desk staff are very helpful.  The hotel has been recently renovated, and it's now a high design boutique hotel that features some decent contemporary art and high end finishings: it's stylish and attractive. The bar on the mezzanine is a great…"
April 2012,"try this new hotel: fabulous location, lucky find","Belgraves' unbeatable location -- with its posh shops and expensive luxury hotels -- makes this hotel's reasonable prices and stylish modern decor a truly lucky find. The hotel, with its 85 rooms, feels like a private (but unstuffy) club, and the neighborhood was a joy to walk around at night -- a leafy, peaceful and still part of central London.   The entrance is flanked by tall walls of lush ferns and greenery and then cantilevered steps to the second floor cocktail lounge, with cozy seating arrangements in a cool luxe setting with inoffensive contemporary art, jewel toned colors and textures. (The only offensive part was the slightly juvenile/uninteresting music.) There is a cozy outdoor terrace in the back. Didn't eat at the gold-toned restaurant but the chef, Mark Hix, has…"
April 2012,What could be a fabulous hotel ruined by the fact that the lighting in the room is totally inadequate,"The Belgraves has all the makings of an excellent hotel. Good staff, very well designed rooms and well thought out facilities and ammenities. However, what they were thinking when they designed the lighting in the rooms, is quite beyond understanding. The ambient light, even with all the lamps turned on, makes it impossible to see what you are doing. One also cannot leave the curtains and blinds open in an attempt to make the room brighter with natural light since the room we were assigned was overlooked by at least 5 other rooms. Unfortunately would not stay there again for this reason and urge the management to at least change the upgrade the wattage in the lamps in order to throw more light on the situation."
November 2012,New hotel in a very good location,"Very good location in the best part of London in Belgravia. Very nice area to walk around and very close to high end shopping (designer stores, Harvey Nichols and Harrods).  The hotel is still very new and both the staff and facilities need to ramp up. There was a problem with air conditioning but it was solved with a temporary solution. Service in the restaurant was pretty slow and waiters seemed to be inexperienced.   But the staff was very friendly in general and they made our stay very enjoyable! We were travelling with 2 young kids and we were also very happy to be upgraded to very comfortable connecting corner rooms."
November 2012,Superior Service,"Although I am a fan of more traditional boutique hotels, I was very impressed with the Belgraves which has a 60s-ish New York-style vibe.  The service level is outstanding, the staff addressed me and my husband by our name, we were greeted every morning in the lobby and at the front door by the  young doormen in their cool plaid shirts and black jeans. Our room was very comfortable, clean, quiet despite its proximity to the lift, and the bed was heavenly. Check-in was courteous and helpful with a smile.  We are very frequent travelers and have stayed at the best hotels in the world. This new hotel is a success and should strive to maintain its service level which is the first quality all guests expect but unfortunately do not always encounter. My only criticism is the low…"
April 2012,New york cool in london!,"I cannot rate this hotel highly enough! I felt like i was in an uber cool hotel in new york!! Check in was quick and efficient, very friendly staff.. The doormen were excellent, the barmen amazing-cocktails were out of this world! The room was comfy and modern. Room service was great- prob one of the best ive ever had-our cooked breakfast was actually hot when it arrived still and tasty!! The whole stay was perfect and faultless and i will definitely be staying here again! Thank you very much to all the staff for making our stay so wonderful!"
August 2012,Good deal,Stayed for 3 days while attending the London Book Fair. Very nice newly opened hotel so all the interior is very modern. The rooms are not very big but very well laid out and look great. The beds and mattresses are very comfortable. Bar and lounge area look great and the outdoor smoking area is very well designed which is very unusual. Breakfast was good. The location for my purpose was not good but overall it´s fine. Bought the stay on www.jetsetter.com and it was a great deal for a 4/5 star hotel. Would not buy at the regular rate but for what I paid it was great.
November 2012,"Service, Service, and More Service!!!!","We stayed at the Belgraves Hotel for 8 days and 7 nights for the Olympics. It is located in the heart of Knightsbridge, one of the most exclusive areas in London. We had reserved a car to pick us up but they were late and could not find us.  So we took a cab which turned out to be the cab ride from hell from Heathrow. To say the least, my husband and I were not in a great mood to begin our hotel stay given a long flight from the U.S. coupled with the cab incident.  We arrived about 10 am at the hotel and were greeted by two very nice young doormen. They took our luggage from the cab and open the door to the hotel for us.  This was the beginning of a very wonderful stay.   From the time we set foot in the hotel until the day we left, we were treated like royalty. The concierge…"
October 2012,You will enjoy your stay,Best concierge service you will get in a hotel.  Great location. Quiet.  Rooms are not the biggest but they have the Best beds. Friendly staff.  You feel home. Once you stay here you will want to come back.
October 2012,Great hotel!,"The hotel offered excellent service and a very pleasent stay, defientely a hotel to try if you havn't and I will be returning shortly. The staff were excellent and really tried to make sure your needs were catered for. Great US serrvice in the heart of London!"
October 2012,a memorable stay at the Belgraves,"This is by far the best hotel we have stayed in in London! Welcoming and helpful staff from arrival to departure, well appointed rooms with excellent facilities (the shower is to die for!) and the most comfortable bed ever.... It is in a side street which means a quiet and peaceful night ahead... What else can I say except go and see for yourself, you will not be disappointed! And another thing..it was a special occasion for me and my partner and we were upgraded to a studio suite! It has never happened to us before in London!"
October 2012,Shelter from the Storm,Great Hotel. Staying here a few nights as our layover turned into an open ended stay thanks to Hurricane Sandy! But not to fret. We made the right call by booking a suite at Belgraves and are really enjoying the place. The staff is attentive and neat. The rooms are well appointed. The shower is AWESOME! Only complaint is the daily Internet access fee....no worries we have 3G.
October 2012,A jewel of a hotel,"This hotel has much to commend it, including great location, design and friendly employees, particularly the very eager, welcoming bell staff. It's not inexpensive -- and the approximately $22 daily charge for internet service was ridiculous -- but the overall value is pretty good. Plus, the showers are phenomenal, with awesome water pressure, stable temperatures and intuitive controls."
May 2012,Amazing Luxury Stay at The Belgraves,"I have never written a review on TripAdvisor, but my stay at Belgraves, forced me to have to write one. I had the most amazing stay at the Thompson Hotel. Unbelievably great service from check in to check out. From Julian at the door who personally addressed me every time I entered and exited the hotel, to the other staff at the door, to the front desk staff, to the concierge, I literally couldn't have asked for any better service. I communicated a proposal would be happening during my trip, and they made us feel so comfortable and took care of us more than I could have ever imagined. We were sent a complimentary bottle of champagne on the first night, and the room they placed us in was amazing. We purchased a King Premium room, and it was great. It featured a nice foyer area,…"
June 2012,Excellent location,We had a standard room which was a little on the small side but that's London for you.  Otherwise it was fine.  The hotel is very attractive with good modern artworks.  We had lunch in the Hix restaurant which was fine; can't really say much about it as we only had a salad.  The bar was good with an extensive cocktail list and there is a fantastic smoking area; what a rarity these days.  Staff were all very helpful and friendly.  Would definitely stay there again.
June 2012,Good and Bad Points,"This hotel is in a great location - the best part of London, very civilised with smart designer shops in nearby Sloane Street, good quality high street shops in nearby Kings Road and surrounded by residential streets and embassies.  Sloane Street tube station is nearby and Knightsbridge tube station is a ten minute walk. I found the staff to be disconcertingly dressed in casual clothes and to be incredibly nosey about my life and my trip when I checked in.  This ""friendliness"" was really beyond a joke; I was even asked ""Will anyone be joining you in your room tonight?""!! - ""Yes, my husband"". The rooms are small but clean and functional and we had a good view of London. We ordered our breakfast for 7.00-7.15 with a note to ask for it nearer 7.00am but by 7.27am it still hadn't…"
July 2012,perfect location and great service from hotel staff,"It was a central location. We had good help from concierge service to book nice restaurants and discover city. My only problem was the tiny room. But overall, we enjoyed the hotel especially great food at our hotel. "
July 2012,City retreat,The newly renovated former Sheraton on the border of Chelsea and Knightsbridge is now a hip boutique hotel with comfy beds and a rock star concierge named Sage.  We stayed a week while in town for Wimbledon and the staff could not have been more helpful.  The food is good and there are lots of good restaurants/shopping within a short walk.  The only two complaints I have about the room were the uncomfortable toilet seat and the poor lighting.  Otherwise a winner all around.
June 2012,Great Room!,"I booked this room at the last minute and was not disappointed.  The staff was great and recommended places nearby to go out.  The room was big and very nicely set up.  The desk was large and had outlets for UK, EU, and US plugs (which is great if you want to charge multiple devices without having more than one converter).  There was plenty of closet space and it had a very modern look and feel."
April 2012,Great weekend choice,"Stayed in the hotel for 1 night during a weekend trip with a friend - our double premium room offered enough space for us (beds were really comfortable), and we loved the sofa area looking out (great for girl's chat over a cup of tea). Location very convenient - close to shops, restaurants, museums, and not in a noisy neighborhood. Though the see-through shower cubicle wasn't our cup of tea (we are old friends so we don't really mind)..."
June 2012,Belgraves,"I stayed here for one night in April.  I've stayed at other Thomson properties, and have had mixed results (love the Smyth in NYC).  First the not to good....The first room that I was assigned was a designated handicap access room, which I did not like.  When I asked to be moved to the room type that I reserved, I was given every excuse in the book why there weren't any available.  At one point, they offered to ""see what they could do"", and told me to stay in the first room to wait.  I got bored, so I went out to do a bit of shopping, and when I returned about an hour later, I was told that because I had used the first room, they could not move me becasue the reservation was ""completed"".  That's a new one for sure.  The only way that I was able to get the room that I reserved…"
March 2012,weekend trip London,"New furnitured. Modern rooms. Launch, bar and smooking garden are OK. The hotel is surounded by Ambassadies. Quiet.Yong personal that acts OK. The NIX restaurant is good and prices are reasonable. Next to the hotel is Palm restaurant, USA food  and good quality. Bibendum, a restaurant near by is excellent. Five minutes from Harrods. With cab you can reache everything; however traffic is slow."
June 2012,Disappointed!,"I booked a room here--for about $350--on a business trip.  When I checked in, I was shown to a room with an unmade bed!  The embarrassed staff then ""upgraded"" me to a larger room.  I had just 1 bath towel.  And there's soap and lotion--but no bath gel, just a small bar of soap.  It took me 5 min. to find a plug for the hair dryer.  (Not laid out very well for business travel.)  I asked for an 8 a.m. wake-up call and was called at 7!  The walls were so thin that I could hear the cell phone conversation in the room next door.  People were talking and slamming doors until 3 a.m.!  I felt as though I was in a tourist hotel.  Couldn't sleep all night.  The location is great but, needless to say, I won't be back."
December 2012,Excellent!!,"London was our first honeymoon stop and we got to the hotel around 8am. Hotel staff upgraded us and checked us into our room pretty fast. After our first day out, hotel staff left a bottle of Veuve Clicquot for our celebration which was a real delight! The hotel is situated in the poshy area and in one of the quiet streets with a nice prestigious environment. We loved it! Service was great. Rooms are clean and spacious. Location was convenient. Only thing to make it perfect is if hotel could provide free wifi. My husband loved the hotel and enjoyed our stay very much! We'll come again, no doubts!"
April 2012,Wonderful hotel,"I stayed for one night on a business trip and must say the hotel was lovely. The hotel was clean with a large sized room. I was upgraded free of charge by the front desk so I guess the room was a bit bigger than the double I originally paid for. There were no wall to wall carpets in the room which is common for UK (and for me is a big ""yuk"" factor). Instead there were lovely wooden floors. Gorgeous bathroom with bath and shower. The hotel uses REN products which adds a nice touch. I would definitely return to this hotel for business purposes but also on a familiy trip as the location is great for vacation. 5 min walk to Sloane Square and King Street. A great addition to London's hotel selection!"
November 2012,Truely amazing,"I stayed in this hotel recently while on a business trip and the hotel was truely amazing. If you want a great hotel, thats excellently designed and is a true experience to stay in then i genuinely recommend this hotel.   Keep in mind that London is an old city and the hotel sometimes feel like old generation hotels, but this hotel is cutting edge.  The beds are comfortable and the rooms beautiful. This is London so the rooms are small, but not smaller than the suual London rooms.   Hotel staff are amazing and very well trained.   The food is great, I recommend you have the scrammbled duck eggs for breakfast.   Location is the only problem, its not very close to any tube station, but still the nearest one is walking distance away. Knightsbridge tube station is about a 10 minute…"
November 2012,Great experience,"I had a wonderful experience during a one week stay at Belgraves! Team is friendly and helpful, bar and restaurant are excellent and the decor is beautiful and extremelly confortable. Location is great!"
November 2012,a beautiful discovery,"a wonderful long weekend at the Belgraves; the staff were a real pleasure. eager to help, and pleasant all through. it is not very common these days to have a team from reception, to concierge as well as the team at the Bar and Lounge, to be all in complete sync in terms of freidliness and eager to please!! great location at the heart of London whether you are visiting for business, pleasure or shopping! highly recommendable."
November 2012,A very nice hotel.,"This hotel is filled with helpful accommodating staff who will assist you with every need. The room was clean and comfortable  and the food in the restaurant was fantastic. A very modern hotel in a nice part of London, a very pleasant stay."
November 2012,Fantastic hotel with wonderful (and very helpful) staff!,I thoughly enjoyed my stay at the Belgraves hotel. Very modern rooms (with no carpet which is a 10/10 in my view!). The staff are very accomodating. Great location/very central if you know the city. D.Bain
November 2012,"Modern Hotel, Amazing Service, Great Location","Coming from NYC, my wife and I had high expectations, as we've spent time at Thompson hotels there.  The Belgraves met and exceeded all of our expectations.  The hotel is modern, the staff were very friendly and helpfull, and it's in one of the best locations in London.  Within a few blocks of the hotel is some of the best shopping and restaurants the city has to offer.  I would highly recommend the Belgraves to any traveling to London, and look forward to staying with them again on my next trip."
November 2012,Great Experience,I booked a last minute London and have never been.  I did some research but not much due to time constraints.  I had a 12 hour flight and checked in exhausted.  The staff was extremely polite and professional the entire stay.  I sat down with the concierge for 30 minutes and she gave me so many options and keyed in on what she thought I would like.  Everyone on staff was nothing but helpful and made my first few days so easy.
October 2012,Great location and staff,"Great hotel, staff are exceptionally friendly and attentive, remembered by name the whole time.  Not cheap of course but you get what you pay for.  Good location close to about 3 tube stations.  Walking distance from Knightbridge and Hyde Park but the area itself it quite quiet.  Decor is superb, espcially in foyer.  Great lighting, nice carpets.  Bathroom is very well designed.  Nice fixture and fittings in the room.  Comfortable bed.  If I were being picky I would mention the specks of paint on the desk in the room that were out of kilt with everything else."
November 2023,Cool hotel in London,Stayed at Belgraves Hotel for one night (after enjoying a private reception at Buckingham Palace which is nearby).  Very friendly staff in all areas of the hotel.  It is a very cool hotel where I felt very welcome and relaxed.  Delicious dinner and breakfast in HIX.  Highly recommend and I shall return.
October 2021,Great Hotel to Saty,I have stayed recently at The Hari and it was my first time vesting London. The staff are very friendly and CLARA​ LEFRANC Guest Relations Manager is an amazing person who shared special wishes with me and celebrated by birthday.  
November 2023,The Hari is an undeniable Gem in Belgravia,"From the minute you step into this gorgeous boutique hotel, you feel very much at home. A cozy and modern hotel located in a beautiful neighbourhood, 10 minutes walk to Hyde Park, Harrods and KnightsBridge shopping district. The bed is extremely comfortable and the rooms are super clean. The staff are so lovely and welcoming especially Claudio at the front desk who made us feel right at home.  I have become a regular , and cant think of anywhere else better to stay at in London."
November 2023,Very Pleasant stay ,"When we arrived the staff at front desk were very welcoming. Great stay, comfortable room with great amenities. I look forward to staying again.We had a lovely birthday surprise in the room for my daughter, very thoughtful. Thank you "
November 2023,Very nice hotel with a terrible F&B program,"Great location, friendly staff and spacious rooms. The downside is that the onsite Italian restaurant is horrendous as is the room service and you may sit at the bar for 30-45 min and never see the bar tender. I would expect more from a company that is trying to be a luxury brand. That being said, nice stay. "
November 2023,Our favourite London hotel. ,"We got married and came here after our ceremony, the team made us feel so special and was the perfect end to our perfect day!   Everyone you interact with is lovely and personable the service impeccable.  No matter who you are, or how busy it is there, you are made to feel like you are the only guests they are looking after!  The food is incredible, we literally wanted to eat everything off the menu!   Cant wait to return.  "
November 2023,Amazing team,"The service at The Hari was outstanding, each member of the team was so kind and smiley. The design of the hotel is elegant, glamour and confortable. The renovated rooms are stunning. Alex, the pillows and the carpaccio were the highlights of my stay !"
November 2023,The perfect stay ,"I really enjoyed my stay! The room was very comfortable, which made it a perfect stay with my boyfriend. The view from our room was stunning, with the London Eye in the background. The service was impeccable and the staff very attentive and friendly. I would highly recommend this hotel!"

November 2023,Amazing Hari-Halloween weekend,Amazing venue at the Hari ! All staff members were very attentive and helpful. I definitely recommend the brunch on Sunday: cozy atmosphere; nice singer artist and impeccable service. Thank you again for making me feel at home. 
October 2021,Great Hotel to Saty,I have stayed recently at The Hari and it was my first time vesting London. The staff are very friendly and CLARA​ LEFRANC Guest Relations Manager is an amazing person who shared special wishes with me and celebrated by birthday.  
November 2023,The Hari is an undeniable Gem in Belgravia,"From the minute you step into this gorgeous boutique hotel, you feel very much at home. A cozy and modern hotel located in a beautiful neighbourhood, 10 minutes walk to Hyde Park, Harrods and KnightsBridge shopping district. The bed is extremely comfortable and the rooms are super clean. The staff are so lovely and welcoming especially Claudio at the front desk who made us feel right at home.  I have become a regular , and cant think of anywhere else better to stay at in London."
November 2023,Very Pleasant stay ,"When we arrived the staff at front desk were very welcoming. Great stay, comfortable room with great amenities. I look forward to staying again.We had a lovely birthday surprise in the room for my daughter, very thoughtful. Thank you "
November 2023,Very nice hotel with a terrible F&B program,"Great location, friendly staff and spacious rooms. The downside is that the onsite Italian restaurant is horrendous as is the room service and you may sit at the bar for 30-45 min and never see the bar tender. I would expect more from a company that is trying to be a luxury brand. That being said, nice stay. "
November 2023,Our favourite London hotel. ,"We got married and came here after our ceremony, the team made us feel so special and was the perfect end to our perfect day!   Everyone you interact with is lovely and personable the service impeccable.  No matter who you are, or how busy it is there, you are made to feel like you are the only guests they are looking after!  The food is incredible, we literally wanted to eat everything off the menu!   Cant wait to return.  "

November 2023,The Hari is an undeniable Gem in Belgravia,"From the minute you step into this gorgeous boutique hotel, you feel very much at home. A cozy and modern hotel located in a beautiful neighbourhood, 10 minutes walk to Hyde Park, Harrods and KnightsBridge shopping district. The bed is extremely comfortable and the rooms are super clean. The staff are so lovely and welcoming especially Claudio at the front desk who made us feel right at home.  I have become a regular , and cant think of anywhere else better to stay at in London."
November 2023,Very Pleasant stay ,"When we arrived the staff at front desk were very welcoming. Great stay, comfortable room with great amenities. I look forward to staying again.We had a lovely birthday surprise in the room for my daughter, very thoughtful. Thank you "
November 2023,Very nice hotel with a terrible F&B program,"Great location, friendly staff and spacious rooms. The downside is that the onsite Italian restaurant is horrendous as is the room service and you may sit at the bar for 30-45 min and never see the bar tender. I would expect more from a company that is trying to be a luxury brand. That being said, nice stay. "

November 2023,Very nice hotel with a terrible F&B program,"Great location, friendly staff and spacious rooms. The downside is that the onsite Italian restaurant is horrendous as is the room service and you may sit at the bar for 30-45 min and never see the bar tender. I would expect more from a company that is trying to be a luxury brand. That being said, nice stay. "

October 2021,Great Hotel to Saty,I have stayed recently at The Hari and it was my first time vesting London. The staff are very friendly and CLARA​ LEFRANC Guest Relations Manager is an amazing person who shared special wishes with me and celebrated by birthday.

The bed is extremely comfortable and the rooms are super clean. The staff are so lovely and welcoming especially Claudio at the front desk who made us feel right at home.  I have become a regular , and cant think of anywhere else better to stay at in London."
November 2023,Very Pleasant stay ,"When we arrived the staff at front desk were very welcoming. Great stay, comfortable room with great amenities. I look forward to staying again.We had a lovely birthday surprise in the room for my daughter, very thoughtful. Thank you "
November 2023,Very nice hotel with a terrible F&B program,"Great location, friendly staff and spacious rooms. The downside is that the onsite Italian restaurant is horrendous as is the room service and you may sit at the bar for 30-45 min and never see the bar tender. I would expect more from a company that is trying to be a luxury brand. That being said, nice stay. "

November 2023,Very nice hotel with a terrible F&B program,"Great location, friendly staff and spacious rooms. The downside is that the onsite Italian restaurant is horrendous as is the room service and you may sit at the bar for 30-45 min and never see the bar tender. I would expect more from a company that is trying to be a luxury brand. That being said, nice stay. "

I would expect more from a company that is trying to be a luxury brand. That being said, nice stay. "

November 2023,Very Pleasant stay ,"When we arrived the staff at front desk were very welcoming. Great stay, comfortable room with great amenities. I look forward to staying again.We had a lovely birthday surprise in the room for my daughter, very thoughtful. Thank you "
November 2023,Very nice hotel with a terrible F&B program,"Great location, friendly staff and spacious rooms. The downside is that the onsite Italian restaurant is horrendous as is the room service and you may sit at the bar for 30-45 min and never see the bar tender. I would expect more from a company that is trying to be a luxury brand. That being said, nice stay. "
