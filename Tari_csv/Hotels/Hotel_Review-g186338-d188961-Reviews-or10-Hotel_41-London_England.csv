October 2023,Great Vacation,"We thoroughly enjoyed our recent stay at Hotel 41.  Every staff member that we came in contact with was ever so helpful.  I would like to thank Nishan for all the work he did prior to our arrival.  He recommended and arranged all of our tours, restaurants reservations, shows, etc., and secured the tickets prior to our arrival. His expertise was invaluable.  Our morning breakfast was handled expertly by Shadrack; he was efficient and an absolute delight. Throughout the day we were greeted by Esin who was most helpful and so pleasant and sweet.  We cannot say enough wonderful words of praise for the staff. The hotel facility is lovely.  It is truly an oasis when you want to escape the hustle and bustle of London.  It is beautiful, clean, and tranquil."
October 2023,No better place in London to stay,"This was our 10th stay at Hotel 41 since 2013.  It only gets the better with each stay.  From the moment we arrive a little sleepy from our overnight flight to the last breakfast before heading to the airport the service levels are unparallel to any hotel in the world.  As I may have said in previous review, any hotel with a button on the phone that says ""Whatever, Whenever"" is a place you must stay.  We will be back again (and again).    The entire staff always has a smile on their face and treat you like family."
October 2023,Recurring theme,"Back to 41 again, and how lovely it was to return.  When you haven’t stayed for a few months, you tend to forget the amount of pleasure you feel when the greeting comes from each and every member of the team who approach with a welcoming smile.  And so it begins: the experience of being a treasured guest at every moment of contact, your every wish carried out and in many cases, anticipated and a choice offered.  This is five- star hospitality as it should be, as the prestigious Forbes rating denotes.   There are many accounts of the quality of the Team, the Executive Lounge, the impeccable housekeeping, the wonderful quirkiness of the building and the Plunder the Pantry offering (which was recommended to me by an American guest who was unaware that I was a regular, and was…"
October 2023,The best of the best,"Hotel 41 can not be beaten. It is so comfortable and relaxing with attention to every detail. We have stayed many times and will continue to do so. We feel so at home in the lounge, where we enjoy the friendly atmosphere, and a laugh with the staff. Satish, Esin Rory and Gabrielle are just priceless."
October 2023,The most fabulous hotel in the heart of London.,"An exceptional boutique hotel next door to Buckingham Palace and 2 minutes from Victoria.  Only 28 rooms, each beautifully appointed and very, very quiet, despite being in the centre of London.  The staff provide 5 star plus service from booking to departure. They are friendly, gracious and extremely helpful.  A perfect oasis for a short or long stay.  Delicious breakfasts. Snacks on display and a magnificent range of wines, cocktails and spirits."
October 2023,Practically Perfect In Every Way,"The ideal London hotel. The staff lead the charge in creating the charm, elegance, and character of this wonderful respite. They work in tandem to create incredible bespoke experiences for their guests, taking care to understand our personal and practical needs, while enriching our experiences with their own personal flare. It was such a pleasure to spend time with each and every one we met there, and sincerely appreciate their attentiveness, thoughtfulness, and creativity.   The beds and amenities are modern and comfortable, and the rooms, halls, and lounge exude cozy luxury. The lounge spoils guests with day-round availability of snacks, and there are fresh scones, jam and clotted cream after 2pm...skip the mid-day nap and rest up for your evening out by having scones and a…"
October 2023,Very unique and memorable hotel.,"I've been to many 5-star luxury hotels, but Hotel 41 left a very special impression. The entrance to the hotel was not large, but the hotel staff, who seemed to have been waiting for us from the moment we opened the door and walked in, welcomed us, guided us to a special lounge, served us welcome tea, and we received check-in service while eating a small cake. I was very impressed that the hotel already knew who we were and provided service before I even said my name. The hotel room was very comfortable, luxurious, and clean, and they provided cleaning service in the morning and evening, as well as a small gift. Also, every time we came back from sightseeing in London, they welcomed us at the door, so we felt like we were coming home every time. All of the bedding at Hotel 41…"
September 2023,Exceptional Service,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for three nights while in London. The hotel is wonderfully situated for exploring the city.  The room was lovely.  It was very quiet and the bed and pillows made falling asleep easy after a day of adventuring.  The shower had plenty of hot water and great water pressure.    The best thing about the hotel is the personal service.  The staff was eager to make sure we enjoyed our stay and our experience in London.  When we arrived after an overnight flight, the concierge saw to it that we got the best coffees to keep us awake and going throughout the day.  We were even able to check into our room early!  For the hotel happy hour, the server brought us canapés and salty snacks gratis.  The concierge was always eager to offer help and suggestions…"
September 2023,Stay here for a wonderful experience ,"I've stayed at many hotels, 5 stars among them over the years, but this place in terms of furnishings, and exceptional service absolutely stands out. In a word, it is a fabulous place and in a great central location as well. You can usually find something to critique wherever you go but we couldn't here.  From the time we arrived to when we left the service was 5 star plus. Consider this for your next trip to London as we will on our next trip...I can't imagine staying anywhere else after being here"
September 2023,Hotel 41 stay was excellent!,"My spouse and I stayed here for one night in mid September 2023. We loved it. We arrived into Heathrow from east coast U.S. at 6:30 a.m. and took the Tube To Victoria Station. From there it was about a 5 minute walk to the Hotel. We had emailed a couple months in  advance to ask about an early check-in. We got a quick reply with an offer to leave our bags and relax in the Executive Lounge. Arriving around 1000, we received exactly what we were told. The Executive Lounge was excellent! We enjoyed coffees, ordered greek yoghurts with raspberry compote (delicious) and very soon after our room was ready. The staff at check in and in the Executive Lounge were great. Our room (Junior Suite) right outside the Executive Lounge was top notch. A very large bathroom with both a large…"
November 2022,A Unique experience,"How do you describe a stay that was so exceptional it boggles the mind? Yes, this hotel is not cheap- but it is an extremely unique experience. Everyone is there to make sure your stay is the best that it can be.  My room was beautiful- there is no other description. I asked for a referral to a place that had a nice Sunday roast - with an hour’s notice. Fifteen minutes later they found 2 perfect choices, I made my selection, and off I went to a lovely dinner at a fabulous gastro pub, after they secured a cab for me on a very rainy day ( with a printed map in case I wanted to wdlk) . Or perhaps my experience walking in to breakfast, and having someone following me with pair of scissors in her hand, mentioning that I had a tag hanging out that she could help me with… Then there…"
November 2022,Loved our stay at the gorgeous hotel 41❤️,"The service was absolutely immaculate, the hotel was extremely clean and everything was so neat and tidy. I most appreciated the scent in the hotel it always smelled so lovely. Diarmaid did an exceptional job to take into remembrance our daily plans and to jot them down so we could have an itinerary! The entire staff was so kind and breakfast each morning was really delicious as well. We will definitely be coming back ❤️❤️"
November 2022,Awesome Hotel and Staff!,We stayed here as part of our 30th Wedding Anniversary trip.  Everyone at Hotel 41 made us feel special during our entire stay.  The Hotel and Staff did all the special touches as to why we will definitely stay here again the next time we are in London
September 2022,A special hotel,"It had been 4 years since my last stay at Hotel 41 when I returned in August travelling solo. Another stay ensued in late September, this time with my husband.  I love the attention to detail and special touches both in our room and the lounge and of course the fabulous staff who make staying here so wonderful. Hotel 41 is comfortable, cosy and in a great location. Hands down my favourite hotel and I can’t wait for my next visit."
October 2022,Magnificent!,"My husband and I had the absolute pleasure of staying at the hotel for a birthday treat ! It was nothing short of magnificent! The hotel itself is exquisite and impeccably cared for but what really made it for us was the staff. They are quite simply phenomenal and that includes those at the door, porters, reception staff, housekeepers - they are all an absolute credit to the hotel. Nothing was too much trouble and we had some lovely conversations with them all, each and every one showing a real interest in us both. We had breakfast which was delicious on all counts and served in the executive lounge which has such atmosphere ! The room was immaculate and cleaned to perfection with everything you could possibly need.The only downside was leaving ! Thank you so much to everyone…"
October 2022,Incomparable ,"41 never disappoints. The location is ideal. The staff is incomparable.  Everyone manages to be attentive, professional, knowledgeable and also fun! The lounge is perfect. The rooms are elegant and comfortable. We have stayed here many times and intend to visit often. It is, quite honestly, our favourite place away from home."
October 2022,"Awesome, amazing, the best ever!","This hotel was amazing.  The rooms were luxurious and comfortable.  We ate at the restaurant multiple times.  The food and drinks delicious.  Everything was perfect.  The best.....was the staff.  To the person, they were attentive, helpful and kind.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone.  WE WILL BE BACK!!!!!!!!"
October 2022,A truly lovely place,"Second time  and still just as lovely. You can quite understand why people continually return. A simply wonderful place and to appreciate it, you need to plan a stay. Bedroom once again was a sheer delight and with a perfect sleep, one could not ask for more. "
October 2022,Could not be happier,hotel 41 made our London experience as positive as it could possibly be. From the second we walked in the door the staff treated us better than we could have asked for. We never needed to ask for any service they promptly tended to every need we had. Alex was our favorite! He was so helpful with answering our questions and couldn’t have been more attentive. He recognized us when we walked into the lounge and even had our room number down. He created such an amazing and luxurious vibe for our stay here. So incredible! I couldnt recommend this place more.
October 2022,Exceptional Team giving 100% and more,"The staff truly make this hotel. From the moment you walk through the door, they are attentive and ready to help you with anything. This was our second visit to Hotel 41, unfortunately it didn’t go as we had planned. My husband was hospitalised on the day we were meant to leave. Dean and the team quickly jumped into action and prolonged my stay in our original room, provided me with support and company following my hospital visits. Little treats like a foot spa and lovely bath products where provided. I really want to thank all of the team for helping me through a stressful time, they were all truly magnificent. We will definitely return to hopefully complete an uneventful stay, we wouldn’t stay anywhere else in London. Thank you again to my Hotel 41 family. If you are planning…"
July 2022,Highly recommended,"We have visited this hotel several times recently and we have always thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The staff are amazing.  We had a slight issue on our latest stay (nothing major), but the hotel reacted perfectly to put things right.  My mantra has always been not too judge a business on an error or mistake but how they respond / rectify it - on this note, Hotel 41 went above and beyond.  We will be back soon ……"
July 2022,The Best service you will receive anywhere!,"We spent 3 week and traveled all over the UK.  We only stayed at the the very best hotels (all 5 stars) and Hotel 41 offers the the finest service in all of the UK.  We have stayed at their sister property, the Ashford Castle, which is one of the best resorts in the world, but the experience here feels like you are a member of the the most exclusive club in the world."
June 2022,"Highly Recommend, Must Stay Here!","What an experience! Absolutely impeccable service, people, and place, starting with the champagne checkin to the beautiful room, snacks, plundering the pantry … I can’t say enough. The rooftop bar is fabulous and the perfect way to feel as if you’re in another world. Actually, everything about 41 Hotel feels like you’re in another world. The location is perfect  — just a 5 - 10 minute walk to Victoria stations (tube, train, coach), close to restaurants, a great location for Hyde Park concerts. The room was fabulous — and the service again — they even neatly  wrapped our USB cords with velcro. Every member of the 41 staff was delightful! Esin, Ellie, and other names I didn’t write down made the experience beyond expectations. I love this place and will definitely stay again. I…"
July 2022,Hotel 41: World Class,"From the moment I stepped through the front doors, I was struck by the friendly, welcoming, attentive and hospitable staff. It was a level of hospitality rarely seen. The Hotel is extremely stylishly decorated...a perfect mix of class and yet comfortable. My favorite was to go up to the rooftop terrace, order a Gin and Tonic. Hotel 41 and their amazing team are world class...cheers to that!"
July 2022,Above and beyond! ,"Stayed here my my husbands 40th, we were giving a room upgrade and greeted with champagne on arrival! This hotel will keep you coming back time and time again, and I would.love to mention Adele the service Manager who made us feel very relaxed and cared for our whole stay, so thank you Adele! 😊 "
June 2022,London Jewel,"Hotel 41 is my new favorite hotel in the world. It's location is perfect. But the main draw is the exquisite service and amenities other hotels don't even imagine. The cozy and elegant ""living room"" is perfect for breakfast, or refreshments after an afternoon of activities. We'll be back next summer!"
July 2022,Outstanding,A truly lovely hotel in a perfect location. We have stayed at Hotel 41 many times and we love it more each visit. The rooms are beautiful and the lounge is a hidden treasure. Adele and her staff make us feel like family.
June 2022,A Hidden Gem,"This was probably the best hotel experience I’ve ever had in all my travels. The hotel is small  and the rooms are cozy but the service is big! They pay attention to every detail to make your stay comfortable. You’re well looked after. The executive lounge is the heartbeat of the hotel. They always have something complimentary on offer at all hours of the day and night. Staff were helpful and courteous and went out of their way for us. It’s in a fantastic area, within walking distance to many of the sites. Definitely give it a try."
June 2022,Exquisite luxury boutique hotel,"This is a totally splendid small five star - at least - hotel. Perfect central location, within walking distance from several must-sees in London, and three minutes walk from Victoria tube station. The hotel comprises just a few - twenty-ish - rooms located on the fifth floor in a charming old building. Service, staff, interior, rooms, yes everything, is totally impeccable. It's not cheap, but I say you get value for money with a lot of staff, and very personal treatment as a guest: The staff know personally who you are, they address you with your name and you are never asked to sign a bill for a drink and so forth. Large and beautiful rooms - even for British conditions. Beautiful and nice lounge where you also eat a perfect breakfast with all the variations you should expect…"
June 2022,Partners 60th birthday treat - 25th/26th June,What a wonderful hotel! Right from booking with support from the great Victoria to having the car collected from directly outside the hotel - greeted and  looked after by lovely helpful caring staff - Steve Jones greeted us with champagne and directed us to what was offered along with the history of the hotel - lovely black and white quirky room - fabulous food - the curry room is a great experience- and the whole experience was truly marvellous making my partners celebration perfect- and of course right next to Buckingham Palace and near to the theatre district- absolutely fabulous- well done to you all X
September 2023,Simply the best of the best.,By far the best hotel I have EVER stayed in. The service was second to none. I stay in London often and often treat myself to a superior room or a suite. Their Executive King room trumped anywhere I have ever stayed including exclusive chains like the Baglioni and St Pancras Renaissance.  The staff were simply amazing. They made sure to know both my husband and I by name our entire stay.  The little touches in the room just went above and beyond. It was truly an experience.  Special shout out to Shân who was absolutely lovely.
September 2023,Unique experience - feels like staying at a friend in his old Englisch home. Highly recommended.,"Excellent! Very unique experience. Not your typical hotel with a gracious foyer or reception. Feels more like staying at your friends old English home. Very cozy. Unbelievable friendly, vigilant and helpful staff. Great location. Lots of attractions and restaurants/pubs in walking distance. Hanging out in their executive lounge provides tranquillity and brings you back in time. The same applies to the rooms. Breakfast and drinks are outstanding. They even have a little rooftop terrace with seating and a bar. The only thing, though: I am 6 feet tall and not all of the sitting areas in the beautiful executive lounge are spacious enough to sit comfortably. One bathroom in our room felt more like I have to put it on rather than being able to walk in. Given the otherwise outstanding…"
September 2023,Perfection,Just returned from a 3rd visit to Hotel 41 as was celebrating a big birthday. From the minute you step foot into the downstairs foyer you are treated like royalty. All the staff are so helpful & nothing is too much trouble. I do have to give Connor a special mention here as he was who we all dealt with the most. They  arranged canapés & champagne on the roof top bar before we went out. You actually don’t even need to go anywhere as there is always something out for you to eat! We all can’t wait to return & are already planning our next visit.
July 2023,Wonderful experience.,"We loved this hotel.  The staff treated us like royalty the moment we walked through the door. Hotel 41 is a boutique hotel with only 28 rooms.  The staff’s attention to detail is remarkable.  The rooms were nicely appointed and the black and white decor is very attractive .  Upon arrival, we were taken to the Executive Lounge where everything happens.  Breakfast, tea time and dinner is served in the lounge.  Our breakfast was included with our reservation.  All other food was complimentary.  The only complaint we have is that it was not made clear that the beverages are not included (ie juice, coffee, tea, soda).  It was our understanding that only alcoholic beverages were not included.  There were four of us present when the amenities were explained.  I don’t believe all four…"
August 2023,Brilliant!,Outstanding service. Excellent location opposite Buckingham Palace. Have stayed twice and will return. It’s the little touches like staff knowing your name that make this hotel stand out. Breakfast was fabulous too.
August 2023,Service with a capital S!,"The service at this hotel is AMAZING!  It is in a great location, and the rooms are really nice, but what separates it is the service!  From the welcome champagne to the day long snacks, they really could not be any more accommodating.  Our stay in London was too short this time but would definitely return to the 41 on a future trip….five stars all the way!"
August 2023,Outstanding Service In an Elegant Boutique Hotel,"The most superb experience we've ever had at a 5-star property.  Outstanding personalized service, beautiful accommodations, and amazingly attentive staff.  We were greeted by name by each staff person, provided super helpful suggestions for day trips and dinner cruise, and made to feel incredibly special.  One of the best boutique properties we've ever experienced - and we've been to a lot! "
August 2023,Excellent Experience,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for two nights and found the experience to be perfect. From the seemless check in, to the fantastic staff. Our room was extremely well appointed and lacked for no amenities. The Executive Lounge was wonderful, and our breakfasts were top notch."
August 2023,Absolutely stunning hotel,"Hotel 41 is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed!  The rooms are absolutely gorgeous.  The staff is UNBELIEVABLY helpful, courteous, welcoming and accommodating.  We will definitely return and will recommend this hotel every time someone asks us about our trip to London.  This one should not be missed!  "
August 2023,Spoiled,"Stayed for my wife’s 50th birthday, from the moment we arrived to the minute we left everything we experienced was just totally flawless, from  the staff to the whole experience of the hotel was just outstanding, the staff go above and beyond making your stay special, by far the best hotel we have stayed in and we will definitely be returning, well done hotel 41 you deserve all the accolades that come your way 👏👏👏"
October 2022,Wonderful hotel experience on our first trip to beautiful London,Very nice boutique hotel right behind Buckingham Palace.  The Executive Lounge always has complimentary food along with menu for purchase.  Staff is very attentive.  They go over and above expectations.  Not a party hotel.  I normally don’t like macaroons but they have really good marshmallow flavor… Also their shower gel and hair products smell very good.  
October 2022,The Crown Jewel,The hotel was exceptional!  Service is outstanding and decor throughout is beautiful!  Staff was always available for anything you needed and always extremely pleasant. I would highly recommend this hotel  You will not be disappointed!
September 2022,Love this hotel!,"I can't express how much I loved ""the experience"" at this little gem. We arrived in London on Sept 28th for 6 nights for the Vikings/Saints game. My husband wanted to stay in Chelsea for the last 3 nights to be near friends who live there, but he allowed me to pick a hotel for the first 3 nights to celebrate my 50th birthday (and a belated anniversary gift).   Hotel 41 is the exquisite little sister hotel to the adjacent full service Rubens hotel situated in the heart of London, a quick walk from the gates of Buckingham Palace. When you walk in, you are warmly greeted each and every time, like you are a missed family member that they are happy to see You feel like you are in a 5 star hotel, without the arrogance of many 5 star hotels.   Your luggage is whisked away to your room,…"
September 2022,Best little hotel at the heart of London,What a delight to find this fabulous hotel.  It is the epitome of English hospitality and service.  Small hotel only 28 rooms.  The service was 5 Star.  We will be back again the next time we are in London.  Just what we needed before departing back home to California. Marta and Stephen
October 2022,50th birthday celebration,"Very comfortable hotel at the center of London. Rooms are vey accommodating, beautifully decorated and very clean. Stuff is great, tending to all your needs. The lounge is great with snacks and beverages served all day and night. We stayed at the hotel for four nights and enjoyed it very much."
October 2022,This hotel will spoil you for every other hotel. Great experience!,"There is absolutely NOTHING not to like in this hotel. From the moment you arrive, till the moment you leave, you are spoiled and pampered. Everyone is going out of their way to make you feel at home. The beds are the best I've EVER slept in. The temperature in the room is easily adjustable, There is no noise disturbance, even if you may expect this in an old building and the service is above and beyond. The warmed floor in the bathroom, heating for your towels, a bath, the room was spacious, with loads of storage, safe and special cabinets for your smaller items. USB spots to charge your items, near the desk and next to your bed. Very convenient. I loved every part of my stay. The room is a great size for what I'm used to in London, but the lounge is just stunning. With…"
September 2022,"Very special small luxury hotel, but service is not what it used to be","This is a very peculiar hotel in the middel of London, set in the 5th floor of the Ruebens Hotel it has its own entrance and elevator, this is my third stay at the property.  Service is still very good and personal, but it takes forever to check in and out.  Rooms are on the small side, and the decoration is starting to look a bit dated (the black sofa on our room 4112 is worn.  Beds are delicious, but upon asking for dow pillows what we got was not satisfactory.  All in all still a very private and good experience, but not as good as the previous two."
October 2022,A fabulous experience,"We were treated by our daughter and grandson to stay at Hotel 41 as part of our Golden Wedding celebrations. We did not look at any reviews beforehand as we trusted our daughters selection.  From the minute we walked into the beautifully scented foyer until the time we left we were treated by staff as visiting VIPs - with no exception.  On our first night we arrived very late due to flight delays and as we sat down to a welcoming glass of champagne another resident asked if we had stayed here before. We explained this was our first visit and she said that you will never want to stay in any other hotel in London again. How right she was.  The food throughout our stay was excellent and we certainly enjoyed the complimentary snacks.  If you are looking for something special, this…"
September 2022,Excellent!,"What can you say about a hotel that is this amazing. Personal and excellent service 24 hours a day. Professional and discreet service from the moment you get up until you go to bed.  Food, drinks available 24 hours a day. Small gifts and hand written notes each night.  Beautifully appointed rooms and bathrooms. All this and a great location. I will definitely return."
September 2022,Prepare to be pampered,My husband and I ended a 3 week vacation  with our stay at Hotel 41.  It was definitely a 5 star experience.  We felt so pampered.  The staff anticipated our every need and we really enjoyed the ambiance of the executive lounge. We definitely enjoyed their team of professionals in meeting our requests and helping us feel relaxed in a new city. The hotel is very close to Buckingham Palace and is a great starting point for many other 'must see' attractions.  Thanks to everyone who helped make the end of our vacation just perfect.
June 2022,"Class, Style & Luxury","Luxury hotel with incredible service and perks.  Everyone instantly knows who you are and are ready to serve you in any way.  You are treated with great respect.  Rooms are lovely,  The executive lounge is incredible.  Raiding the pantry at 8 PM is a must.  Great location too."
June 2022,Exceptional in every way,"I couldn’t be more pleased with my experience at Hotel 41. I was greeted with a complimentary champagne and relaxed in the stunning executive lounge. They serve a delicious breakfast there each morning but also have tasty treats available until 1am. There wasn’t a request or a question that wasn’t handled quickly and with a friendly approach. The staff truly became family to our group of 3 ladies traveling together. They were protective and warm and assisted with securing reservations when needed. I will definitely return to the small, luxurious gem near Buckingham Palace."
June 2022,Amazing hotel not to be missed,I recently stayed at the Hotel 41 for several days and was pleasantly surprised by what an enjoyable experience it was.  This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at.  The service at the hotel is amazing. Every staff member knew our names from the minute we arrived and they went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable.  The rooms were very comfortable.  We had an issue with a light in our room and a maintenance man came on a Sunday evening and cheerfully handled it.  There is a beautiful lounge available 24 hours a day with food and drinks. We ate a delicious breakfast there every morning. Great location near Buckingham Palace and the Victoria Palace Theatre where we saw Hamilton.  I will definitely stay there again and highly recommend it.
June 2022,The best way to end the trip!!,Asmaa and Steve definitely know how to make you feel welcome. The hotel is beautiful and is a great place to relax and feel at home after a wonderful trip!! Steve whips up an awesome Negroni as well as other cocktails. #attention to detail. Thank you Hotel 41!!
June 2022,The perfect getaway,"This was our second stay at the 41; we have stayed at a number of hotels in London but the 41 has become our favorite. It is a warm and intimate setting.  The staff is very friendly, competent and couldn’t be more accommodating (even when you’re cranky from lack of sleep)!!  The location is close to all the things you’ll want to see and very close to rail and bus transportation. We’re already looking forward to our next stay."
May 2022,A Gem of a Hotel in the Heart of Royal London,"Hotel 41 is a jewel of a hotel. The rooms are beautiful, comfortable and very clean. The Executive Lounge is open to all guests 24 hours a day with food, drinks, and a friendly, well-trained staff on hand to assist. The location can't be beat -- it is literally across the street from Buckingham Palace. I can't wait to visit, again!"
June 2022,Excellent,"As usual, the staff and experience were wonderful. We could treat the hotel as a home where we were pampered. Our time in the lounge in the evenings, meeting and talking to staff and guests was just delightful. In our life of travel, we don’t think we have ever met such an attentive and well-trained staff. This is especially impressive during this difficult time of hiring and retaining staff."
May 2022,Great stay at Hotel 41,"I felt compelled to write a review about my stay at Hotel 41. To be perfectly honest this is not my normal level of hotel as it is not cheap. It was a huge splurge for me and my granddaughter. The staff are tremendous as I was feeling a little intimidated, but they were all sweet and welcoming. I especially want to mention Adele who is so excellent in every aspect of her job from being open and friendly to problem management. Also, Esin is so warm and friendly. The rooms are lovely with comfortable beds and spacious bathroom. Nice touches like turn down service with chocolate or a nice pillow spray. One night we sent to see Mary Poppins and they left a glowing message on the bathroom mirror when we got back hoping we enjoyed the show. Notes wishing us a good day..just little…"
May 2022,It just doesn't get any better,"The staff at this hotel is the best I've ever seen. From the reception to the servers in the lounge where you have breakfast and several complimentary snacks. The maids were so caring! But especially the lounge staff, who tirelessly cancelled reservations, got me medical care, and asked constantly how i was (yes I got covid!) The rooms are smallish, but very comfortable. I would go back in a minute!"
May 2022,"One of the best hotels in London, if not the Best!","I have recently become familiar with the Red Carnation Brand and I must say, I love everything about it! they truly make you feel at home.  The staff is incredibly attentive, the rooms are beautiful and no request is too small.  Check-in Process:  Esma from front desk was just amazing, very bubbly and full of life and made the check-in process incredibly fun! Rooms: the Conservatory suite is to die for - the bed is very comfortable, the room is spacious, lots of storage space. truly a beautiful suite.  Lounge: the staff are very attentive and they will make sure that all your needs are taken care of. the food is exquisite, often in lounges, the food can be average however the food there was freshly made with lots of choices.   We booked the private cinema experience which is…"
May 2023,Best London Hotel,Having never visited London we wanted a hotel with great reviews that was central to the major sites. You cannot go wrong staying here. Amazing service and food and comfortable rooms with everything you need!! And the staff could not be more responsive or pleasant! We couldn’t be happier with our stay at Hotel 41!!!
April 2023,A hotel to remember!,"We visited Hotel 41 in late April. It was the first stop on our Europe trip. What a way to start off! This boutique hotel is small (I believe 28 rooms). Due to the size, the service is very personal. Every staff member is trained to anticipate and meet the needs of every guest. It’s quite amazing! The top button on the phone is labeled Whatever Whenever and the really mean that!   The hotel is beautiful. The Executive Lounge s very tastefully decorated and the room decor is awesome. It is clear that attention has been paid to every detail. The hallways are small, a bit uneven and very windy which just adds to the charm. We had a fresh fruit basket in our room every day which was great.   The location was good - not far from Buckingham Palace. I would highly recommend this…"
May 2023,Persfection Personified,"We arrived at Hotel 41 on the morning of Coronation where we were warmly greeted, taken into lounge and handed a very welcome glass of champagne at 9.30am! Previous to that we had received correspondence from the Hotel helping us with instructions of how to get to the Hotel through the crowds of Coronation, where we were told if there was any issues whatsoever we were to phone and they would come and get us on foot! I have run out of superlatives to say about this hotel, it was perfection personified, if we were ever anywhere else we always wanted to rush back to Hotel41. The staff are so special, kind and attentive. We spoke with American guests who are regular visitors, and would not stay anywhere else. We were lucky enough to participate in ""The Curry Experience"" which was…"
April 2023,I must do luxury stay,"From the fist step through the door,  the service was nothing short of excellent, attentive and pleasant.  The aroma within the hotel added to the boutique ambiance.  I had the fortune to be upgraded and i can only say, the junior suites are home away from home.  The pillows and bedding made a normal difficult sleep, turn into an easy and recharging stint.  The location offered a brilliant setting for an early morning run, on the door step of Buckingham Palace.    Thank you Hotel 41 and all the staff"
April 2023,Exceptional Hotel 41,"We stayed 6 nights 2 weeks before the Coronation. Difficult to imagine a more satisfying experience. From location to quality of room, front desk, service, and food and drink, the entire stay exceeded expectations. A exceptional staff and a fabulous experience! "
April 2023,Great hotel near Buckingham,"Fantastic hotel with the best service we could ask for. Great staff, food and atmosphere. Clean and appealing surroundings. We got upgraded after a small inconvenience. Would definitely recommend a stay at Hotel 41, and we will definitely come back our self."
April 2023,Hotel 41 is like heaven on earth,"Hotel 41 is an absolutely magical place! From the moment I arrived I felt like I was in heaven. The staff was so polite and went above and beyond.  The staff seemed to take a genuine interests in the guests. All the staff members my family and I engaged with during our stay, including, Rory, James, Dermo, Satish, Summer, Belle, Trevor, Seamus, and Mengyu, were so kind and personable.  The breakfasts and cocktails were always delicious. The ""Plunder the Pantry"" was such a unique and much appreciated complimentary offering. The food from the ""pantry"" was very good, especially the ice cream. I really enjoyed the gin & tonic flavored ice cream.  During our stay the pantry items included various foods, such as, beef stew, cottage pie, desserts,  pastries, various cheeses, caramels,…"
April 2023,"This is the best hotel in London, but sshhh! please don’t tell anyone, as we want to keep it to ourselves!","My goddaughter and I just spent a gorgeous weekend at Hotel 41. The room was so comfortable, the executive lounge (where all the special pantry eats and late-night feasts can be enjoyed) so enticing and warm, and the location so perfect. But above all it is the wonderful staff, their warmth, kindness and attention to detail (our lemon drizzle birthday cake to die for!) that makes this hotel a place we could never tire of visiting. Thank you!"
April 2023,"Posh, comfortable and a special hotel. Fantastic locations and top- notch amenities. Enjoyed the lounge and staff.","From our arrival to the departure, we were warmly greeted and provided the best service. Our stayed in an upgraded suite which made returning from a long day of sightseeing the best treat. We enjoyed the executive lounge for breakfast, afternoon beverages and little treats. I especially like the tea service as it was just very special & lively. My husband referred to it as my adult tea party. The champagne, beer and spirits were top notch. I enjoyed my morning cappuccino which was perfect in every way. The evening turndown service made us feel extra special. We were assisted with excursions, dinner reservations & recommendations and getting transportation to our excursions. The chilled water each night  by our bed stand was much appreciated. Rooms were charming and very clean.…"
April 2023,Your own private club experience that transports you to the time of real hoteliers! Extra everything.,"Doctor Strange Sanctuary meets John Wick’s Continental - without the drama!  And that’s just the decor. Exceptional staff, beautifully appointed rooms, comfortable beds plus your own “Easy” button for anything your heart desires.  Add cool club like atmosphere and never ending ice cream and other yummies in the lounge, and the experience is perfect.  Fresh milk was a lovely touch and fresh fruit option was great.  Beautiful green wall with 10,000 plants on the side of the hotel and secret entrance - literally round the corner from the King’s palace makes it a must stay.  Will want to try the under the stars room next time. Very memorable and enjoyable stay and really hard to find hospitality. Well done!"
June 2023,Exceptional place to stay in London!,"It was my husband’s birthday and I treated him to 2 nights at Hotel 41. We were not disappointed as the room was superb, the staff genuinely pleased to see us and the breakfast was plentiful. A lovely haven not far from Buckingham Palace. You are greeted with a glass of champagne the minute you walk in to register! Even after coming back from a celebratory meal we had a cup of tea in the lounge and the staff produced a little cake beautifully presented with a candle for him! While I was there I booked a whiskey tasting experience which was very informative and they even gave us a little cake and a glass of champagne with there compliments as it was his birthday! It is a hotel that treats you like a family and gives you a sense of luxury with out being overpowering! The plunder…"
June 2023,The best city hotel there is.,The most wonderful experience.  A rare solo trip for two days and was welcomed and treated like an old friend.  The staff are all wonderful.  Was given a surprise upgrade to the magnificent monarch suite which made this tired travelled immediately relaxed and refreshed.  It’s the best breakfast I’ve ever had and the executive lounge is relaxing at any time of the day.  Wonderful experience and can’t wait to come back.
May 2023,Staff made us feel truly welcome,"Lovely stay.  The hotel staff went above and beyond, and made for a memorable London experience.   We enjoyed spending time in the lounge and on the rooftop patio, both of which were great places to relax after a day of exploring the city.  Highly recommend."
June 2023,Beyond expectations!!,"Outstanding facility all the way around.  Covered us up with smiling service, consistently, and everyone was a delight to be around.  The room was very clean and we were gifted champagne for our anniversary.  Dermo went above and beyond and arranged for packages to be mailed back home.  There are many good reasons that it's the #1 hotel in London.  We're so glad to have stayed with them."
May 2023,Exquisite is an understatement!  ,We have never experienced this type of uniquely refined experience and attention anywhere!  From the time you step your foot into the door you are treated like the King and Queen of England--truly.  Attention to detail at every turn.  Hotel 41 is a charming old English experience without being pretentious.  Treat yourself - it is worth it!
May 2023,Authentic hospitality like we’ve never experienced before,"41 Hotel - where do I start. We’ve stayed at most of the top London hotels so were greatly looking forward to this experience.  The hotel is located on a busy road just a stones throw from Buckingham Palace with many traffic restrictions so we were a little nervous about arriving by car. Luckily the hotel had thought of everything and had sent a detailed information mail in advance outlying their services to assist the guest experience. We alerted them to our arrival so a helpful and cheerful valet was already waiting for us to whisk the car away. When you enter the ground floor lobby, you are transported away from the tourist chaos outside in an instant to a calm and opulent oasis. You are greeted by Marble floors,  wood panelled walls and chandeliers. The friendly staff member…"
May 2023,Relaxing Stop to End Long Trip,"The staff is especially responsive, the service prompt, the rooms are charming, the hotel's location is central to key London sights, the martinis are perfect and the ice cream is delightful for a late-night snack."
May 2023,Outstanding hotel even better staff.,"This was our third visit and everything was simply outstanding as usual.   My partner had booked us a room last minute as a treat for my birthday and we were massively surprised to find that we had been upgraded when we were shown to our room.   From the complimentary glass of champagne during the booking in process through to the open pantry and cheese and ham toasties before dinner and the fantastic choice of snacks until 01:00 hrs you just can’t fault what’s on offer, but the thing that makes the hotel so special is the staff!   Every single member of the team go over and above to make you feel so very special and have so much time for you.   The hotel itself is ideally located for the normal touristy things…Buckingham Palace is your next door neighbour and Hamilton is…"
May 2023,I was treated like royalty,Everything about Hotel 41 is excellent. The comfortable rooms and bed and the fantastic service. From the moment I arrived to my departure I loved every minute. We discovered this hotel many years ago and I had not returned for several years and found that this property has aged well and if anything the service has improved which is hard to believe. They do have rooms with a shower and I have a hard time getting in and out of a bath. I will return again.
May 2023,Weekend break ,"A hidden gem. No bar or restaurant, just the 'executive lounge' which is the hub, where guests are welcomed (with champagne and canapés) and where you can relax, it's also where breakfast is served.  The benefit feels like a quiet private member's club , where you can leave  the hustle and bustle of central London outside,perfect if you don't want a really busy hotel with lobby, lots of other people around.  The downside is a slight feeling of claustrophobia due to the narrow entrance and narrow corridors and the one small social space. To be fair, there is a secret door that leads into next door Reubans Hotel, where there are great bar's and restaurants to choose from, which adds to the exclusive feel of going back to hotel 41 as a nice separate space.The service is impeccable…"
October 2022,Amazing hotel,We travel with our little dog. An excellent welcome awaited us as soon as we entered. They took incredible care of us until our check out. They had prepared a very nice bed in our room for our little dog. We will definitely be back. Especially everything in the restaurant is very tasty and worth trying.
December 2022,20th Anniversary Trip to London,"We could not have dreamed up a better hotel  for our anniversary trip to London! The size of Hotel 41 is what makes it special. Connected to The Ruben, Hotel 41 has its own entrance and private elevator that goes straight to the fifth floor, which is where all 28 rooms are located. We only ever interacted with Hotel 41 employees, aside from when the doormen at The Ruben hailed our cab. When we left early one morning for our Eurostar adventure to Paris, Tio from the Ruben came out and gave us maps and advice for our day!  You immediately feel pampered upon arrival as you are escorted to the fifth floor by the lobby attendant. Once upstairs, you check-in in the Executive Lounge. During the check-in process, you are treated to a glass of champagne and snacks. To our surprise, our…"
December 2022,41 GEM OF LONDON,"I stayed two nights at the 41 hotel in London 23 - 24 December 20022.  Was meeting my sister, her husband and my uncle in central London so wanted to check out a hotel not in central London.  41 was the best boutique hotel I have ever stayed in.  Next to the Rubens Hotel and owned by the same company 41 was a great experience.  From check in to check out I was pampered, taken care of and helped with any travel questions I had.  Location is not great but it is 3 minute walk to the tube.  Rooms are fantastic, with a fire place on the first level,  the room I had was a two level room.  The check in area is also the hotel lounge which serves drinks and food and snacks at time.  The lounge also had a big library, so if you like to read it had lots of interesting books.  Over all a…"
October 2022,Best hotel stay ever!,"Hotel 41 was the most amazing hotel experience I have ever had! This was my first trip to London and I will never forget it because of this fantastic hotel!  I found this gem not realizing how wonderful it was until we visited. The people were helpful, genuine, and made me feel important yet cozy at home. The hotel and staff took wonderful care of us! My husband and I can't wait to return to stay with them again. "
December 2022,Hotel 41 over Christmas,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for nine days over Christmas. We chose the hotel based on a stay there in 2013 which had been very enjoyable. The location of the hotel is excellent, the rooms are comfortable and the single, central lounge is warm and welcoming. But what makes this hotel different is the staff. The staff to guest ratio is higher than in most other hotels and the service is simply outstanding. Every one of them goes out of their way to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. I cannot thank them enough for making our Christmas a home away from home."
December 2022,A hidden gem,"Well what can I say from the moment we arrived and pulled up outside. The staff were quick to park the car and the feeling of total relaxation descended. The care, the greetings and smiles , the warmth , of the ambiance of this beautiful hotel took hold. We were upgraded and the room was to die for. The drinks , food and the personal touches made this stay very magical at Christmas, so we can’t thank and praise enough the staff at the hotel 41 for the pleasure. We also popped next door to Rubén’s hotel for the cocktail experience which was a lovely evening so a big thank you to the staff there also, in summary if you want luxury at a personal level please try this jewel hidden in London well worth the visit ."
December 2022,Post Xmas joy!! ,"To take a phrase from Craig Revel Horwood our stay was 'Fab-u-lous Darling'!!!. From the moment we both arrived and checked in, to the morning we sadly departed a wonderful experience was made.  Many thanks to all the wonderful staff who made our stay special. "
December 2022,Exceptional staff,"This hotel is special because of its staff.  The rooms are nice , the position is good  but so are in many other 5* hotels in London, but you never get a service quite like in Hotel 41.  I was a bit skeptical when I read reviews in the past but they are in the class of their own.  It is not just that the service is great, it is that all the staff seem to be happy to be and work there!  It makes a big difference. There seem to be two types of rooms - the reasonably priced rooms and the not so reasonably priced suites of various types.  We stayed in the reasonably priced room which had everything you could want though some of it was a little on the bijou side, e.g. shower cubicle.  But hey, there was one as well as bath so it is great.   The bed is comfortable, there is a space to…"
November 2022,Beyond excellence,"I recently made a return visit to Hotel 41 as the previous experience with my husband was superb and we intended to return. I now travel alone having lost my husband but was determined to return to Hotel 41 as we had planned. I experienced excellence at all levels of Hotel 41 from the rooms, facilities and of course the wonderful staff who  were attentive, warm and caring making this stay extra special. I am so looking forward to my next visit in 2023. Thank you to everyone at Hotel 41."
November 2022,the only place to stay in London,"Our delight was the staffs main concern every moment & every night we stayed @ Hotel 41. This exquisite boutique hotel surpassed every one of our expectations. We are an international traveling couple. And to receive from the Staff of Hotel 41 such individual greetings, assistance & personal attention is an art of service seldom experienced. This art of service is solidly engrained in every fiber of the true character of Hotel 41's being. The staff's commitment to detail is effortless on their part, its simply their nature. We experienced an unsurpassed caliber of service, relaxation & comfort in the Executive lounge for afternoon tea, evening snacks & beverages, to the plush comfort & the delicious macaroons in our suite. So may tiny details of perfection! In passing, we…"
March 2022,A true 5 star hotel,"Late review but I had to show appreciation when I remembered.  From the hotel doorman and entrance hall, to the lounge and room, everything was magnificent.  Lounge had a complimentary sweet bar and fridge stocked with ice cream for guests and we were welcomed with a glass of champagne. Full English breakfast was one of the best we’ve had and very generous.  Room was small but very nice with comfortable bed and nice touch of lavender pillow spray for us to use and take home. Also a surprise birthday cake for my husbands 30th.  All staff were friendly and accommodating without being overbearing, no snobby staff who haven’t got the time of day and look down on you here.  We loved this hotel and would definitely visit again, it’s the perfect place for a special occasion or just…"
February 2023,"An introduction that went really, really well.....","Three of us checked in to 41 – two of us as regular returnees and one as a new guest – to kick back and relax.  Dean had coordinated the new booking seamlessly and was there to greet us. From the outset, our friend was impressed with the efficiency and outstanding, welcoming service that we know is the heartbeat of 41.    Another success was our supper reservation at The Curry Room downstairs. Read a separate review for that excellent meal.  No need to venture outside on a cold night. Just sign your bill to the room.      Plunder the Pantry on Saturday night was the acid test after a delightful lunch at The Wolesley followed by a long walk.  He loved that evening’s offering of pork pies, cheese, and pickle jars, and went back for seconds of the mac'n'cheese.  And this was after…"
February 2023,"Lovely hotel, great location, outstanding service.","We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in February 2023. Good room, great location, but most impressive- outstanding service from every single staff member.  Helpful, courteous and knowledgeable, from the chambermaid to the manager. Fabulous!"
February 2023,Best hotel stay ever,"This Hotel and the staff are simply unbelievable! From the moment we walked through the door to the moment we had to leave I cannot describe what a fab stay we had. Unforgettable and we will return!   The service, complementary food, the room, the location - everything was simply perfect and made our anniversary stay so special.  Thank you!"
December 2022,The Best!!,"I would recommend Hotel 41 for all the obvious reasons - the best location in London, rooms, amenities, exceptional service and most importantly; value for money. I have stayed at Hotel 41 previously and most recently stayed at the hotel during the end of December 2022. It is what you would expect from a 5 star hotel - absolutely no faults. But, what sets Hotel 41 apart from other hotels are the amazing staff. They make the experience of staying at this hotel truly memorable - they are always friendly, extremely attentive, and clearly the best at what they do. Nothing was too much trouble for them and the smallest of details matter, from arrival to check out. Thanks again to Adele, Marlen, Dean and Dermo that were willing to go out of their way to make it an unforgettable…"
January 2023,Best 5-star hotel,"My wife claimed to be speechless when we entered our room at Hotel 41, but the superlatives kept coming.  From the very discreet entrance near Buckingham Palace to the check-in process (with complimentary drinks and food) to the executive lounge, the facilities are luxurious and the staff professional and extremely friendly.  The list of things they can help you with is long and includes packing your belongings prior to checkout.  The hotel is located in a very nice area of London within short distance of places to visit and a 2-minute walk from an underground station.  A stay at Hotel 41 is a lifetime memory and it is the best 5-star hotel we have visited."
January 2023,Lovely stay,"Everyone we met was so lovely. They remembered everything about us, couldn’t be more helpful and were very attentive. Wish we were there longer than 1 night. The room was really nice and the little touches like the candle in the bathroom made it extra special. "
January 2023,Incredible ,"We had our trip gifted to us for Christmas and it’s safe to say we will most definitely be back. The whole stay from the moment we checked in and felt like Luxury. The staff are phenomenal and cannot do enough. There is so many fabulous touches, the candles and petals in the room, the complimentary pantry, scones, ice cream. Not a single bad word to say as the hotel was incredible. We are looking forward to coming back to experience the pure luxury again! "
January 2023,The Perfect Stay in London,"Hotel 41 was the perfect stay in London. From check in to check out, every need and question was catered to. The staff was unbelievably friendly and really went out of their way to make my stay extra special. All the small noticeable touches were so lovely, especially the turn down service, what a lovely way to get ready for sleep. The executive lounge was such a beautiful spot to sit outside of the room and socialize with other guests. All the food, from afternoon scones, to plunder the pantry, and all the treats available all day long, the canapés, there was literally not a single moment to feel hungry. The breakfast was top notch. I don’t have a single complaint about my stay and cannot wait to return in the near future."
December 2022,Amazing service at Hotel 41,"We stayed at Hotel 41 in late December and I have to say that I have never experienced more attentive service. From the moment we arrived the staff were  super eager to help. We arrived on an early flight from Australia and  started with complimentary champagne and an excellent breakfast by the fire. They had our room ready soon after breakfast - something I really appreciated after such a long flight.   Hotel 41 is a boutique hotel - it is not large and aside from your room there is one main area that is used for reception and food service, as well as a smaller room used for reading or to host large tables for meals. After a small issue with the bath tub we were upgraded to suite. Stay in one of these if you can - it was beautiful. Our previous room was lovely and had…"
September 2022,Three days of bliss,"It was lovely to return to 41 again and to relax on the sofa with a greeting glass of their excellent house champagne.  Owing to the pandemic, our recent visits have been reduced in number but we hope to bring them back to a regular pattern as time progresses.   Lots of new faces - again owing to the huge changes in the whole of the hospitality industry - and all the new staff are of the same high standard of friendly, efficient service as in previous times.    Only the best for 41.  Alex has only very recently arrived - a matter of a few weeks - and yet he conveyed a knowledge and attentive, caring attitude that made us feel as though he had been there for much longer.  Giving us his full attention, he still kept a discreet eye flickering over the room as a good professional…"
September 2022,Un-British in quality and service,"London has many fantastic hotels and unfortunately I found out today that this is not one of them. If you are looking for high quality and hygienic British establishment at this price with staff who value etiquette and manners please consider the Rosewood; the Connaught, the Park Lane Hotel, the Hamyard Hotel, the Chiltern firehouse, so on. Even the Savoy packed on a hen-do filled weekend is better.   The doormen are lovely, I have walked by this spot for many years and had lovely exchanges them. I thought I might go in for a spot of lunch with a friend who was staying at the hotel after a long morning of volunteering. I wanted to change into a better outfit before sitting down.  I entered and the entryway was full of tourists; it smelt damp and felt stale but I suppose it…"
September 2022,Anniversary,A truly memorable stay made special by the amazing staff and service.  The experience was personalised and thoughtful we would be delighted to visit again soon and will recommend to family and friends wishing make a wonderful memory.
September 2022,Hotel One-derful!,"Stayed at Hotel 41 from September 11-15, 2022.  From the moment we entered, the staff just lavished us with TLC!  We felt that we could ask them for anything to lessen the fatigue and stress that is felt the morning after any travel involving crossing time zones.  The Queen’s passing made the neighborhood around the hotel quite crowded and  chaotic.  Once you entered the lobby, it was quiet and felt like an oasis of calm.  We loved the comfortable bed, delicious snacks and breakfast and most of all, the cheerful, professional, courteous and kind staff.  We will look at other Red Carnation Group hotels when we travel again.  Thank you, Hotel 41, for making our first visit to London very special."
September 2022,Wonderful Hotel and Staff!,"I really can't say enough about our experience at Hotel 41. The hotel itself is beautiful, with a gorgeous main lounge/lobby, and a beautiful rooftop terrace. The room was spacious and chic, and the amenities were plentiful. But the thing that really shines is the staff. Every person we encountered was lovely and so helpful. Their attentiveness was such that I felt like we were the only guests in the entire hotel. They even surprised us with an upgrade to a suite when I told them it was my birthday, and went above and beyond to delight us throughout our time there. I will absolutely be back, and cannot recommend this hotel and it's staff enough."
September 2022,Top Notch Service,"We had a lovely time at Hotel 41! The service was phenomenal and attention to detail was pristine. The staff was always overly accommodating to any request we had. The breakfast was always enjoyable. We appreciated the cleanliness of the hotel. Also, the location was great."
September 2022,An amazing stay in a wonderful hotel with fantastic staff,"This was our second stay at this unique hotel and was our number one choice to enjoy another special occasion, this time my wife's birthday. After first staying 6 years ago to mark the night I proposed I thought this couldn't surpass that occasion and the extra mile the staff went to ensure it really was a special event but they pulled it off.   To say we were given a room upgrade is an understatement of epic proportions. We were presented with the Conservatory suite in all its splendor, which was a wonderful surprise for us both. I can't thank them enough for making this happen. The room was mind blowing and thankfully we had a clear night sky and was able to fall asleep beneath the stars.  The staff are amazing, friendly, knowledgeable and made us feel at ease throughout our…"
September 2022,A pleasure!,"Charming, beautifully designed & appointed boutique hotel. Staff went above & beyond to help us during the very difficult weekend of the Queen’s death. Wonderful breakfast & gorgeous executive lounge. Black & white decor is stunning. Lovely experience!"
September 2022,Outstanding!,"A return visit and such a treat. Unparalleled hospitality and comfort from a superb, professional team. A special thank you to Steve Jones for the genuine warmth of his welcome - what a gentleman! Also to Esin who's smile and real friendliness was matched only by the late summer sunshine streaming in through the windows! Thank you too, Adele, for your kindness on checking out. The whole team are an absolute credit to the business - it's not often you can say that."
September 2022,Friendly and quiet town house hotel with discrete and immaculate service,"Quite and friendly atmosphere, excellent rooms and service. Clean and large room. Great lunch and breakfast and we were also offered excellent drinks late in the evening. We also received a nice welcoming letter in order for the hotel to adapt to our needs. This is from now on our favourite hotel in London."
August 2022,An absolutely incredible boutique hotel within walking distance to Buckingham Palace,"We had an absolutely amazing time during our stay at Hotel 41. So much so that we skipped the last stop on our trip to go back to Hotel 41 for 1 more night before heading back to the states. The hotel itself is beautiful and in a perfect location but the staff is what really set it apart. Everyone was incredibly welcoming, helpful and attentive. If I find myself in London again, I won’t even bother looking at another hotel!"
September 2022,Amazing service!,Amazing boutique hotel across from Buckingham Mews.  Great location and the service is amazing!  Very personalized service from the most professional and friendly staff.  We will definitely return and will make this our go-to London hotel.
September 2022,It's a little gem and you're lucky if you stay there!,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Hotel 41! It all started with Stephanie's big beautiful smile when we arrived late at night from the airport. She greeted us with a warm welcome and checked us in. It was our first time in London and her friendliness put us at ease right away and made us love the place.  The lounge area where we were checked in was elegantly beautiful and they had complimentary delicious food buffet-style available all whole night.  We asked for a quiet room in advance and we couldn't be happier - in the center of London we didn't hear a thing even when our window was open. Our bed was very comfortable.  The next morning Vera took care of us for an exquisite breakfast. Very sweet, with impeccable manners and skills, highly attentive and caring - she truly…"
September 2022,Hotel 41,"We retuned back to Hotel 41 again and nothing has changed.  When you arrive at the front door you enter a small entrance and hallway where you are greeted to by the door man who takes your bags. You ascend  to the 6th floor where the library / reception is and you are greeted with a great hospitality and drink. They don’t worry about checking you in they make you comfortable and you can help yourself to some incredible food and more beverage.  Bedrooms are very well appointed and fitting for the design of the hotel. No expense was spared.  Location is a across the street from The palace, a walk to Chelsea , Mayfair and soho. August /September are great months to spend in London. Walking , shopping , museums patios and of course all the history one could want.  Our stay at this…"
August 2022,British Hospitality at it’s Best!,"From the moment you enter the front door you know this in not your typical hotel. Old world elegance, great service from people who truly care and very comfortable rooms.  The air conditioning was probably the best we’ve had, very much appreciated during London’s recent heat wave.  Very nice lounge and breakfast, and the grill restaurant at the Rueben’s next door (affiliated) was amazing."
August 2022,Greatest hotel In London,"It is hard to describe what a stay at Hotel 41 is like. There is no doubt in my mind that it is the finest hotel in London. We have traveled to all parts of the world and 41 is undeniably our favorite hotel. From the moment you step out of the cab to the moment you leave; your every request is fulfilled. The staff are some of the finest people you will ever meet. The aroma therapy throughout the hotel is intoxicating. Upon arrival, you are greeted with a complementary glass of champagne and that is only the beginning of world class service. They offer a wonderful executive lounge that is open 24 hours, with complementary snacks and drinks. The bedrooms are beautifully appointed, and the showers are amazing. The bed and linen are top of the line. Absolutely heavenly."
August 2022,The ultimate personal 5 Star  hotels in the World.,"We have been privileged to stay at many 5 Star hotels around the world London included, however Hotel 41 is a true “Diamond” . It is just not the uniqueness of this hotel rooms but the level of service provided by its totally “commitment staff “ to excellence and personal attention.   Over the past 7 or 8 years we have got to know all members of its staff, from the leader Mr Malcolm Hendry GM, Andrew Muir & Dean Sparrow, In full charge of all things wonderful about the very professional yet, “personal service”    I fully recommend on your next visit to London, treat yourself to a Royal stay at Hotel 41, looking out over Buckingham Palace!  Thanks for the wonderful experience yet again!  John G, Ft Lauderdale, FL USA."
August 2022,Hotel and staff are as close to perfection as possible.,"Wow. Just WOW. Hotel 41 is something very, very special. Immaculately presented, the common area was just stunning. Canapes and champagne on arrival whilst you are taken through the check in process. Our 2 story Junior Suite was out of this world luxurious.  The common rooftop area along with their own bee hives (in the centre of London mind you) is a place to get away from it all. The staff. I can only equate the professionalism and attentiveness to that of Kato from the Pink Panther movies. The staff pop up everywhere and at anytime ready to fulfill your requests. Dean, the assistant manager, WAS JUST WONDERFUL. Warm, approachable and very hands on, he is an asset the company would do well to do whatever it takes to hang on to him, should he ever wish to leave. Then there's…"
August 2022,Hotel Perfection,"My wife and I just completed a nine night stay at Hotel 41.  All aspects of this hotel are outstanding:  friendly, helpful, warm and attentive staff, great food, a wonderful lobby space for breakfast, tea, and late night glasses of wine/champagne or cocktails, an outdoor rooftop area for cocktails or just hanging out, no surprises on the final bill, and a central location in London.  If you are looking for the perfect hotel for a short or long stay in London, this is the place. We stayed in the Conservatory Suite, which has a large glass conservatory roof over the bedroom (with two electric retractable privacy shades), as well as two bathrooms (the downstairs one has a toilet and sink, while the upstairs one is very spacious and includes (along with a toilet and sink) a large…"
August 2022,Perfect from beginning to end!,"Hotel 41 is absolute perfection.  The attention to detail, service and staff are all top notch.  I loved returning after a day out to Hotel 41.  I felt spoiled each and every day of my vacation.  I can't wait until I can return.  The best place to stay in London!"
April 2023,Amazing hotel and very attentive to all needs.,5 star service. Everyone is very attentive as soon as you arrive. Lots of extra touches which makes the stay even more special. We had a great time and does feel like your home from home as very cosy. The pantry is also very tasty. Will come back.
March 2023,Amazing honeymoon experience 😍 ,"My husband and I recently stayed at hotel 41 London, in the Conservatory suite for our honeymoon. From the moment we walked in we felt well taken care of, and we enjoyed everything from the greeting glass of sparkling wine to the optional extras like flowers and chocolates in the room. The meals, the service, and the beauty of this historic boutique hotel were all excellent. Be aware though, it is in the heart of the city and if you're a light Sleeper you may want to consider something to cut the noise of sirens. "
April 2023,Unique interior and very friendly staff,"Very friendly staff who helped us, excellent customer service, great location, nice food, the roof terrase is an extra cool feature of this hotel.  Interior design and furniture are unique and has its nice character. "
April 2023,Absolutely first class,"After numerous visits to Hotel 41, it never fails to please. The accommodation is outstanding, and the breakfasts are amazing. The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff are a credit to the Hotel. Nothing is too much trouble. "
March 2023,"The best hotel in London, hands down!","This is the second time we've stayed at Hotel41 and it won't be our last. What makes this hotel extremely special is the care that each and every staff members provide. It is amazing that the staff knows and remembers your name. Once you arrive, they never ask your name, they just know it. I tried to find out how they do it, but no one would divulge this secret. :-)   We loved hanging out in the lounge before and after dinner! The endless amount of snacks provided are also such a special touch. The housekeeping staff is the best staff that I've ever encountered, and we've stayed at many luxurious hotels. We can't wait to come back and visit again!"
February 2023,Hotel 41 - Only Option!,"I don’t usually write reviews, but in this case, I must. The staff at Hotel 41 graciously welcomes you into their family and makes you feel like home.  After spending seven nights at Hotel 41, I can truly say that other hotels simply do not and cannot compare. This is a 5-star hotel that is head and shoulders above other 5-star hotels. A few specific shout outs are absolutely necessary.  Sebestian (from Ruben’s) - His cheery disposition and positivity is second to none!   Alexandros - His thoughtful dining suggestions quickly became our list of musts. Alexandros’ quiet and considerate nature was so welcomed after long, busy days.  Belle - She always knew what we wanted before we even had to ask. Being proactive, attentive, and personable are just a couple of Belle’s strengths. …"
March 2023,Fantastic stay,"Fantastic stay at hotel 41. We stayed for two nights and had a wonderful stay, the bed was so comfortable,soft luxurious linen. The room was clean and had everything you needed. The staff couldn’t do enough for you, very attentive and professional. There is absolutely nothing to criticise, from the moment we walked in to the time we checked out."
March 2023,Exceeded Expectations ,"A place you dream of going back to. Prime location close to sights and public transportation, quiet, staff that treats you with a personal touch, a plethora of amenities from a free high-end buffet to little treats left at turndown and plush rooms that mix modern touches with old English style.  What a value for a hotel that makes you feel special each moment you come in or leave! Every staff member was friendly and interested (huge shout-out to Alex who served me several times in the lounge) and they made an effort to listen. For example, on my first night I returned home from a show to find a note from housekeeping saying they hoped I enjoyed it.  The accommodations are quiet and peaceful. I spent hours in the lounge in the evening reading and enjoying the complimentary buffet…"
April 2022,At Home in Hotel 41,"Before my family travels abroad, we usually research the highest rated (by ranking) hotels in our destination cities.  In 2016, Hotel 41 (A Red Carnation Property) was one of the highest ranked hotels in London & featured stellar reviews for its location &  service.  We decided to stay there and were thrilled we did.  We will never forget the tea and treats, the uniquely designed rooms and convenient location.  All the photos of their rooms and common areas on the  website look pristine and that's exactly how we found them.    After busy days of exploring London, visiting Stonehenge, and taking in the musical Aladdin, we return to Hotel 41 ready to relax as if it were our home.  We would usually sit in what looked like a large library or observatory and just exhale & recount the…"
March 2023,Amazing hotel and such attentive staff.,"Where to begin?! We went to London to go to the theatre for my wife's birthday and stayed two nights. All members of staff at Hotel 41 were fantastic and nothing was too much trouble for anyone. We were upgraded to an Executive Suite which was lovely. The room was super comfortable and the little touches were so nice from a little message on the mirror in the bathroom to finding our glasses cleaned and a hotel styled glasses cloth each left for us. Petals by the bed and a hot water bottle waiting for us were more wonderful touches. The food throughout the day was delicious- big fan of the plunder the pantry- and all staff from the doorman to the porters were all fantastically friendly, helpful and attentive. We felt like they were all so eager for us to have the best possible…"
June 2023,The Best,"I have stayed at some of the best hotels around the world and I must admit that it takes a lot to impress me.  Hotel 41 not only impressed but surpassed all expectations.    The hotel has only 28 rooms all on one floor close to Buckingham Palace.  The hotel has the feel of an exclusive private club without an air of pretentiousness.  Our room was very very nice with bed sheets and pillows that were a joy to experience each night  But it was the service that truly set this hotel apart from others.   Individuals like Eder, in guest services, went out of his way to ensure that we had all that we needed.  He took the time to personally help us pick up an item that we needed as opposed to just providing directions to the pharmacy.  This was a hint of the type of service that we…"
June 2023,TIME TO RELAX and be SPOILED!!,"I chose this hotel because it was part of the a Leading Hotel of the World.  Upon arrival I have to be honest I was SO surprised at how tiny the check in area was. No lobby, etc, but stay with me.  We were warmly welcomed and escorted upstairs for check in.. Checkin in is literally in their small cute dining lounge. Again because we travel a ton this not the traditional expectation.   It took a minute ( about 20)  for me to adjust.  Our room was not read yet  as we had arrived at 8 am.  We decided to relax in this lounge/eating area and have breakfast. It was at this moment when I started to ""get"" the reason this was a Leading hotel.  First we had the loveliest Spanish girl check us in. When we sat for breakfast we were welcomed with a glass of champagne and then spoiled with…"
June 2023,Perfect boutique hotel in London,"The wonderful staff make this hotel- they couldn’t do enough for us +++. The signature scent is devine and permeates throughout the hôtel. Wonderfully comfortable bed, fabulous breakfast. Reception and dining area - gorgeous. Complimentary snacks 24/7, scones in the pm and champagne on arrival. Great location. Couldn’t fault anything. Lovely rooftop area"
May 2023,Hotel 41 - London ,"Hotel 41 is an incredibly special hotel. Truly a jewel in London! The rooms are warm, charming, and unique to the wonderful property. We are eyeing the conservatory suite for our next stay! A night under the stars! More importantly to us, as boutique hotel, guests become family members. The Hotel 41 team is amazing. They treat you like family, welcoming you as if they’ve known you for a long time. Every time we left on an outing and returned to the hotel, team members asked about our day and engaged in genuine conversation. We also never wanted for anything. We never wanted to leave! Really. Highly recommend. We will return. Thank you to the Hotel 41 team!"
June 2023,The essence of traditional British hospitality service in its finest quality.,"I can't tell you enough about this jewel across the street from Buckingham palace, and I am a spoiled brat, staying at Ritz Carltons, Four Seasons, etc. In addition to all amenities that you get at a fine hotel of that level, it has all the character that one could imagine watching TV series like the Crown, including its fine hospitality service. It is located on the last floor of a six story late 19th century building, with its own entrance and door man. There is a lot of privacy in all areas. There is a private club lounge that serves fine snacks and drinks almost 24 h. day. There is a butler that takes care of you and everyone knows your name. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone that goes to London for a special occasion or to dive into the cultural experience. My…"
June 2023,Highlight of our trip!,"We stayed here for a mother-daughter trip to London. From beginning to end, we were amazed at the service and accommodations. The Executive Lounge area was the hub for meals, tea/beverages, and a place to relax and snack. We ate breakfast there daily and it was delicious and plentiful. They also offered a roof top area that we enjoyed amazing sunset views. The location was convenient and we walked most places including a bus tour that we caught a few blocks away. My daughter turned 18 and the staff really made her feel special with cards/notes, red velvet cake, and a gift. It was a very unique and overall exceptional 5 star experience. I would 100% recommend and would stay here again in the future."
May 2023,Can we say incredible!!!!,We visited London and chose Hotel 41 and can we say pampered and covered in luxury and caring staff!  Everyone made sure our stay was perfect and we had everything we needed in this boutique hotel right next to Buckingham Palace!  Just do yourself a favor and stay there!!!
June 2023,London Holiday,The hotel is amazing and the service exceptional. A beautiful stately hotel in a great location conveniently placed to access Victoria station.  The breakfast is in lovely old world setting and the quality of the food is fresh and prepared according to your request.  The rooms are also maintained to a high standard and there are no tell tale marks of wear and tear. The staff also take note of what you may have told them and we arrived back from Wicked show to have a message written on our mirror hoping we enjoyed the show along with a couple of macaroons with the Wicked logo upon them.  Just one of the special touches to enhance our stay.
June 2023,Spoiled by the best staff ever!,"Exceedingly attentive, friendly, helpful, and professional staff, from top to bottom.  The room was clean, had a very comfortable bed, and excellent A/C. We felt at home here in London for 6 nights. Would definitely stay again!!"
June 2023,Perfect (again),"I stayed with my son for a couple of nights.  The staff were, as usual,  the shining light of the hotel. Nothing is too much trouble for them - always friendly and very helpful. Bedrooms are immaculate and breakfast is top notch.  Another return visit is planned …"
July 2023,Hotel 41 Is What Every London Hotel Should be Modeled On,"This is hands down my wife's and I favorite hotel (and now even our 3 children)! We've been there 3 times now and It's pure English Class with the best service that we have ever received anywhere in the world. The rooms are impeccable and the thoughtfulness  and attention to detail of the staff is exquisite.   Also, their executive lounge (the heart of the hotel) is one of the most coziest and relaxing places we have ever had a meal or drinks. It made me feel like at anytime I could turn my head and see Sherlock Holmes in a corner sofa drinking some brandy attempting to solve his next case.   All that to say, if you want an unforgettable time in London, Hotel 41 is a must! "
August 2023,Suberb and welcoming !,5 star service ! From the arrival to the departure. Very impressive. Connor was so kind and congenial. This type of service has a high value to us and we are very happy we chose Hotel 41 for our London 4 day trip. This is a great location close to the Victoria Train station /Gatwick Express.
August 2023,Sons 18th birthday,Great hotel . Staff went above and beyond for my sons 18th birthday . They put us in a private dining room for breakfast . They offered us a welcome drink . The snack bar was amazing with ice cream included 
August 2023,10/10 an absolute dream stay ,This hotel is a gem in London! Great air conditioning (for us from the USA) and the staff was incredible. The food was 5 star and house keeping impeccable. Would recommend to anyone and will return again! 
August 2023,The No 41 experience ,"Second time at this hotel and definitely won't be the last! A luxurious stay from start to finish . Beautiful rooms,wonderful staff and such a calm , tranquil atmosphere. Fully deserving of its reputation as the best in the UK."
July 2023,Not our cup of tea by a long shot!,"I have relied on TripAdvisor to book hotels and restaurants for almost 20 years. We even sometimes select cities to visit simply based on the hotel. As such and because I so rely on reviews that I relate to, I want to provide a clear picture of what you get at Hotel 41. We have previously stayed at The Edgerton House (another Red Carnation hotel in London) and the Ritz Carlton in London - and we absolutely loved both. In fact, we so enjoyed our time at The Edgerton House and after speaking with the manager there, we wanted to book another hotel in their collection.  We extremely disliked the ""atmosphere"" as well as the teeny tiny rooms, extremely narrow hallways, and limited common space at Hotel 41. And no one, except for the gentleman at the lobby desk one evening, ever asked…"
August 2023,Simply First Class,Excellent staff and service food and location brilliant rooms really lovely and decorated to a high standard wonderful stay all round hopefully will be back soon thank you to all for making us feel very welcome 
March 2023,Very Warm Welcome,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 again on a trip into London. It's an absolute gem. From the moment you walk through the door you are treat like royalty, every member of staff will go out of their way to make your stay as pleasant and as enjoyable as possible. The room was fantastic with every little detail considered and thought through so you want for nothing, with special little touches thrown in like welcome Macarons, turn down service etc. Drinks and plundering the pantry add to the whole relaxing and enjoyable experience. Having tried many similar hotels in London, this is our hotel of choice, it is simply first class!"
March 2023,Incredible hotel ,"How great to return to your room in the middle of winter with the gas fireplace glowing. With all our previous stays at the amazing Hotel 41, this is the first time our room came with a fireplace. We loved the warm, cozy atmosphere the fireplace created in our room. Although every room and suite can be very different, although they all have the famed black and white design theme.   Of course, hospitality and service by this caring team are still second to none. With the departure of former resident manager Lauren, the resident team of everyone including Dean and Marlen went out of their way to ensure we enjoyed everything and left with smiles on our faces. Thanks Adele for the goody bag of treats for our travels to Birmingham. This is the the only place we will stay when…"
March 2023,"41 is a jewel amongst hotels in London,",Absolutely awesome hotel. Cannot fault it at all. Pure luxury. Customer service is the best I’ve ever experienced. Special mention to James. Complete maturity and professionalism from a 20 year old. Cannot wait for my next trip here. 
March 2023,Amazing,"I am very spoilt when it comes to hotels. Since I'm a german Lifestyle-journalist who used to traveling the world.  I know a lot of hot spots already.   ...but what shall I say.... Hotel 41 is unique in every kind of a way. The extras like complementary sweets, the plunder the pantry-service. The VIP service for every ! guest (not only for the Very v's) ,. The very private atmosphere. the high-end decor and surrounding. It feels like (I guess)  a little bit like being part of the movie Downtown Abbey, spending time in a Castle, not in an hotel . Feeling like a Duchess in front of the fire place drinking tea and eating scones. Served by so wonderful, high professional , lovely members of the staff of 41. Unfortunately I forgot the names since, but I remember Esin, what a…"
March 2023,Can’t recommend highly enough,"Second time here and I have to say the place is unreal, from the minute you step in the door to the minute you  leave, the service goes above and beyond.  The welcome glass of champagne before you even check in, was a great start. Stunning room, amazing breakfast and top quality staff."
March 2023,Totally pampered,"I can’t praise this hotel enough. Probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in for lots of reasons, and I’ve stayed in some of the best hotels around the world. It’s basically a boutique hotel with 28 rooms. There’s no standing around to check in at a reception desk, they come to you with an iPad while you’re enjoying your welcome drink and some well thought out nibbles in a gorgeous cosy gentlemen’s club like lounge area. In this same room they have an array of complimentary food day and night and a fully stocked paid bar. They are open 24hours. You also get your breakfast there which was delicious. We were upgraded (no idea why) to a suite that had a free mini bar, sky tv and a gas real flame fire that they put on for us that evening. The small group of staff couldn’t be more…"
February 2023,Wonderful Stay,"From the moment you enter the Hotel 41 you are treated with incredible service. There is   amazing attention to detail which makes the stay so memorable. The highlight for me was coming back to the room after a long, tiring and chilly February day in London and finding a hot water bottle in the bed. Bliss! "
February 2023,A cocoon of calm in the heart of London,I had a wonderful stay at Hotel 41. My room was very comfortable and I really appreciated the little surprise touches for my birthday. The service from the staff was exceptional; everyone was friendly and made sure I had everything I needed. One of the best breakfasts I’ve ever had and ‘Plunder the Pantry’ was great to return to after an evening out. I can’t wait for my next stay.
February 2023,A little gem hidden in the city!,"We love this gem of a hotel - it is instantly soothing, from the refreshing water on arrival, to the gorgeous scents and chic black and white decor. The beds are divinely comfortable, all the better to flop into after ""plundering the pantry""! The staff are friendly and give you really personal service. We hope to be back again!"
February 2023,Just like Home.. without the work,"I cannot fault this amazing hotel. It was an oasis of calm in the middle of the city! Every member of staff were exceptional, making us feel so welcome and anticipating our evert need. Being a small hotel made such a difference as you were made to feel very special. The rooms were spotless and very comfortable. We had such a lovely relaxing stay here and we will most certainly go back."
June 2023,The Best Hotel In The World. Period.,"This is a home away from home experience.  If you want a big hotel vibe with loads of action go next door to their sister hotel.  We LOVED our experience here.  The staff were like family by the time we left.  From check in to the incredible bar/waitstaff you literally are spoiled.  Rooms are well appointed with big waters, beautiful soap and lovely little presents on your bed in the evening.  The location is the best close to the changing of the guard, and Buckingham.  The hotel has a cute small rooftop bar that you can have a cocktail and just get away from the chaos of the city.  If I return I will stay here as it felt like home."
July 2023,Best hotel we have been to!,"This is the best hotel in the world!  We've stayed at the Burj Al Arab in Dubai, Pendry New York and The Savoy. None of these have come close to what we received at Hotel 41, pure luxury.  As soon as you walk through the front doors, the pleasure begins. Your bags disappear and you're escorted upto the Executive Lounge where you are treated with a glass of Champagne. Instantly every staff member knows your name and you're given time to relax and unwind from the outside world. Once settled, the staff, in our case Andrea, guides you to your room. We were very lucky to be given the Monarch Suite.   OMG, the Monarch Suite, what a suite! From the Queen size bed, two bathrooms and lounge and every extra you need for a stay. It oozes lush.  Once you get over the room, you'll head back…"
July 2023,The best of its kind!,"By far the nicest hotel we have ever been to. The staff is super friendly and will help you with anything you need. Yes, it is expensive, but it is worth every cent. The hotel is super quiet and you can sleep all day if you would want to. The location is perfect, near Buckingham Palace, walking distance to Harrods and Bond Street so great for shopping. The interior is not boutique hotel modern, but very old school English. Can't wait to be back! "
July 2023,"Always stay here when I am in London. Great service, impeccable hotel.","We’ve just returned from a seven night stay at Hotel 41. We had a split level suite with a king bed that suited our needs perfectly. The attention to detail was evident everywhere, not only in the facilities and amenities, but also in the little touches such as daily replenished fresh fruit and the daily “treats” left on the bed at turndown.   The bathroom featured INSTANTLY available hot water, more than ample water pressure (you never realize how important this is unless you don’t have it), heated towels and ample space for toiletries for two. The bathtub was of a size to encourage basking and the shower was both versatile and intuitive in operation — a delicate balance seldom achieved.   Shortly after your arrival, most, if not all, of the staff will know you by name. At any…"
July 2023,The best hotel ever,"We have stayed at Hotel 41 for the third time. And there is a reason why we always come back. Feels like a quaint Hotel in a large city in the perfect spot.   We spent our anniversaries here for the third time. Always feels special. The rooms are wonderful, staff is amazing and location you can’t beat.   Even the scent of the amazing hotel is something I love. We always think of Hotel 41 as the place to go for a special occasion. Even our happy anniversary pillows and a yummy cake to celebrate. The little things matter in an age where service is hard to come by.   Highly recommend. And always will come back. Thank you for making it wonderful."
June 2023,What a FANTASTIC experience ,"The best hotel i have ever stayed! Simoly the best! Complimentary pantries during all day long (ice creams, lindts chocolates, candies - canapes from 5pm to 7pm and many dishes/goodies from 8pm to 1am), many perks at our room - very cosy place, amazing bed and pillows. Two options to our bath separately ; bathtub and a shower. The breakfast is also incredible, many options. One of the highest point, the icing on the cake: Eder and Pedro , completely wonderful hosts - polite, helpful, always smiling. Their hospitality turned our experience into a marvellous experience. "
August 2022,Hidden Gem Near Buckingham Palace,"We visited for my birthday and from start to finish were treated to such an amazing stay, with everything thought of it was a wonderful place to be, we also loved going for drinks in the downstairs bar which also serves sushi. Picturesque hotel!"
July 2023,Wonderful stay in London,"This is a wonderful boutique hotel found on the fifth floor of the same building as the Rubens. They give very personalized attention—from showing us the room details to helping us with getting a take away breakfast for our early morning flight. We had a gorgeous room and thoroughly enjoyed ""plundering the pantry"" each night!"
June 2023,Great british hotel,"This boutique hotel is truly excellent!  It is small and the service is very personal.  It is better than some Ritz Carltons I have stayed in.  The staff could not have been more pleasant.  It is quiet and not one of those places to be seen in.  Given how hectic London is, it was truly an Oasis.  It is a bit expensive but we do not travel to London often."
April 2023,Perfect London hideaway,"came to this hotel for my britain trip and it was a pretty nice hotel. the service was nice and the rooms were clean. this is a good hotel i would probably come again. Thanks for reading this review, and i hope it helps with future decisions. Have a great day!"
November 2022,Wonderful Hotel,"Lovely, comfortable hotel with flexible eating arrangements and a good linked bar/restaurant next door.   Very friendly and capable staff.   Extremely dog-friendly.   My late husband and I were regulars through and after lockdown and now that I am on my own I am totally comfortable there and made to feel welcome rather than an inconvenience as in some hotels.   Previously we used to stay at the Milestone, a sister hotel, also first class but Hotel 41 now suits me better.   Perfect."
May 2022,What a gem of a hotel!,"We have stayed at Hotel 41 on two occasions and this has become our preferred hotel when staying in London. The whole experience from check in to departure is faultless and attentive without being intrusive. All the staff are exceptionally professional in dealing with hotel guests and genuinely make you feel at home. Check in is a great experience, expect some delightful quick wit and repartee with Steve, who will make you most welcome. The location is ideal for visiting many attractions in central London, but the hotel feels like a personal London club away from the busy hustle and bustle of the City. If you are reading this to consider whether to stay or not, then go ahead and book, you will not be disappointed."
December 2022,Another Great Stay,"What a gem of a hotel!   We are regular guests of the 41 hotel since Christmas 2017 and we thoroughly enjoyed every our stay in this beautiful boutique hotel.  The hotel is a short walk to Buckingham Palace, as well as Victoria (underground, railway, coach) station to easily explore other sightseeing.  The 41 Hotel is quaint and charming; the decor and atmosphere are perfect. We love it!   Our room was perfect; about sleep quality, our room, with view on The Royal Mews of Buckingham Palace, it’s been extremely quiet at night.  Adele,Marlen,Dean and the entire new staff is extremely courteous and helpful. Very accommodating, very knowledgeable and is apparent they do their job with love and did everything with a smile.  The breakfast, served in the Executive Lounge, is delicious…"
November 2022,Quietly indulgent,"Have stayed here and at other great hotels in the Red Carnation Group many times over the years and this is our favourite when staying in London. It is close to  Victoria Train and coach Station. Short taxi ride from Waterloo Station.  Overlooks the Royal Mews and is Ideal for Buckingham Palace and parks such as St James’s and Green Park. Just like a private club with first class attentive and friendly service. Nothing too much trouble. The Executive Lounge is great place to relax and unwind. Plenty of included extras such as Raid the Pantry in the evening, Jude’s Ice Cream and afternoon Scones. In the warmer seasons there is the roof terrace, weather permitting. In the colder seasons return to your room in the evening to find a fire has been lit and hot water bottle in the bed.…"
January 2023,Christmastidings of comfort and joy,"We have officially lost count of the number of times we have stayed at 41.  This hotel is a fantastic little oasis in the middle of the bustle of Victoria. It is highly convenient for transport and also for getting into the west end. Nothing quite beats an amble up past the illustrious neighbour of Buckingham palace (some rooms overlook…), and you can be in Mayfair/St James in a matter of minutes.   For us it is all about the service. Nothing is ever too much trouble and someone is always on hand to help.   This is the very best way to have your own place-to-stay in London without the difficulty of buying such a place (if you could). We’re in London almost monthly (bad theatre and restaurant habit) so it’s pretty key to have a reliable but luxury location.  We’ve stayed in other…"
December 2022,The best of the best...,"My husband & I visited London the week between Christmas & New Year. We came to see London decked out for the festive season & 41 Hotel was the perfect backdrop. From its central location to transport & all attractions, to its fantastic staff, delicious food, and comfortable rooms. We’ve been fortunate to visit London several times in the past and have always stayed at 41 Hotel. While each visit has been different, 41 Hotel has been a constant - one we see no reason to change. Can’t wait for our next visit to London & stay at 41 Hotel."
October 2022,Still Wonderful,"I popped into Hotel 41 as I was in the area and missed my favourite hotel in London! As I walked into the pristine lobby I was greeted by the friendly receptionist as the familiar hotel 41 scent wafted up my nostrils...home again! Oh how I had so missed this oasis.   I took the lift to the 5th floor and entered the calm familiar black and white corridors lined with  quint portraits, which led me directly to the luxurious members lounge. More friendly faces welcomed me as I sat down in the large comfortable leather seat and took in the ambiance. The fire was lit and warming a couple, as they sat snuggled up on the  sofa and enjoyed a lush afternoon tea, champagne at hand and sweet treats galore. Others were quietly reading a paper or engrossed in a novel. The honesty bar was…"
January 2023,A must visit hotel in London,"We first stayed at this hotel just before the pandemic struck, and had to cancel our next stay due to lockdown closures. We had fond memories of our first experience and were looking forward to our second stay. Although we missed some of the very nice and helpful staff we encountered the first time, particularly since they had great amounts of institutional memory with regard to the neighborhood and its food recommendations, we thoroughly enjoyed getting to know the new staff members.   This trip we had a room that faced the courtyard and was therefore relatively free of traffic noise. It was a bit larger than our last king room, with a writing desk at the entrance, which was convenient for the small amounts of work I needed to do during our vacation. All of the familiar touches…"
January 2023,Small but perfect boutique hotel,"The entire experience at the 41  was truely AMAZING!!! Anything from the welcome we got, the hotel it self, the staff, their service and food was FANTASTIC!!! I f you really want to spoil yourself, or someone you know, you should choose to stay at the 41. A beautiful and classic ""old school"" London club hotel,  where you also have snacks provided throughout the day."
January 2023,Excellent,Excellent hotel for the best service and real english feel. Stayed hear in 3 rooms with family and grandma. Still one night to go but already on the conclusion that it’s excellent. Not posh but stylish. No surprise it’s top of the league every year. The staff and service makes it stand out to other hotels.  No doubt we will stay hete again or at any of the other excellent hotels of red carnation. Thanks again.
August 2023,Hotel 41. Highly recommend for a London stay,"Hotel 41 is an amazing hotel. Great location, very friendly and helpful / accommodating staff, comfortable rooms I would never think twice at always staying at hotel 41 when in London. Hotel 41 makes you feel at home. Highly recommend. BTW: Great snack bar in the Fabilous lobby "
August 2023,Perfect,"We’ve just returned from a two night stay at 41 - where stayed over 20 times.  It’s hard to des rube just how good the event is. I call it an event because every member of staff is consistently brilliant, helpful and friendly. Many staff have been there years and it’s like coming home - but nicer.  41 is a boutique hotel - rather like an exclusive club - quite old fashioned but in a brilliant way. The staff are simply exceptional. Nothing is too much trouble. The executive lounge is perfect in its tranquility and style. Adele and Marlen are stalwarts who make everything perfect.   There is a ‘grab’ bar of sweets during the day, scones in the afternoon, various dishes / cakes during the evening all complimentary. It’s annexed to the Rubén’s hotel so the extent of beverages and…"
July 2023,Worth it,I think I have reviewed 41 on other stays but I am not sure I said the following: It is worth the premium you pay simply for the service and the wonderful people that provide it. We actually miss the friends we have made on the staff. And I am not sure there is a better location of a hotel in London to reach everything. Victoria Station two blocks in one direction and Buckingham two blocks in the other.
August 2022,Perfect Stay,"My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary, and the staff was amazing.  They truly define service, and went out of their way to ensure we had a magical experience.  They pay attention to the smallest details to ensure that your stay is memorable."
August 2022,The best hotel in London,This hotel and its staff are phenomenal. The rooms and attention to detail are fabulous. You are so well cared for from the minute you enter. The staff can’t do enough for you. Gorgeous executive lounge. We will definitely return. Massive thank you to all the amazing staff.
July 2022,"A most wonderful stay, pure relaxation and comfort","We decided to stay for three nights for our 10th wedding anniversary whilst we explored London and visited Goodwood for the races.  The standards of all our our service, the friendliness of the staff and the quality of all the good were second to none. Nothing felt stuffy, the staff were just all there to ensure we were happy and looked after.  We asked for feather pillows- no problem, we left our luggage with them whilst we enjoyed London on our last day- no problem, we had a parcel delivered a week after due date and they are posting it to us FOC- no problem.  No matter what time of day there will be tea and scones, arrival snacks, evening canapés that await you and in the evening when coming back from shows etc there is a wonderful pantry to plunder with cheeses, fruit, cakes…"
August 2022,A Perfect Hotel and well kept secret,"We traveled as an American family of 4 including 2 teenage daughters - with 2 rooms, one king room and one room with 2 twins.  Both were beautifully appointed with equal care and attentiveness from housekeeping. The location was perfect.  Close to Victoria station, easy walking to sites if you’d like but also always easy to catch a cab if you’d prefer. The service at all levels was exceptional. We particularly enjoyed that it was a residents only hotel that felt like our own private respite from the “busy” of the city.  Breakfast was substantial (not just American continental) and the other complimentary snacks throughout the day including “plunder the pantry” added to the total experience.  I have nothing negative to say about this hotel.  It is a best kept secret that i…"
August 2022,"Bar-none, the best hotel experience I have ever had.","1 Bar-none, the best hotel experience I have ever had. Review of Hotel 41 Pending review I was traveling alone on a one night stopover in London on route back to the U.S. It was a rare moment to myself to breathe after spending 6 weeks, 24/7 with my teenage daughter and in-laws. But, I couldn't have anticipated how wonderful the experience at 41 was going to be.  It was like getting a brief chance to experience what I imagine life must be like for the Queen. As I walked out of the doors of this spectacular hotel and around the neighborhood, I realized that I was spontaneously grinning.  I couldn't believe my good fortune.  The staff at 41 are exceptional. From the moment I walked in the door I was met with sincere (but never overbearing) warmth, kindness, and a level of…"
July 2022,First Rate Hotel,"This is an excellent boutique hotel.  Our room was well appointed and clean.  The staff is first rate, friendly and helpful.  The ""Executive Lounge"" is an all-day and evening setting for food and drink.  The hotel is very well located in Central London.  One of our favorite hotels anywhere."
July 2022,Fantastic Experience!,This was without doubt the finest hotel I have stayed in. We booked direct with the hotel for a couples experience to celebrate my wife’s 40th birthday which was during lockdown. The wait was worth it. On arrival we were greeted by a friendly receptionist and then a couple of minutes later a gentleman came down to take us up to the main reception on the 5th floor. He was fantastic and offered us complimentary champagne and snacks whilst he processed our check in and made sure our room was ready. A few moments later he took us to our room and informed us that they had upgraded us to a suite. This was wholly unexpected and a wonderful surprise.  The suite was amazing with a separate living room with bathroom and a bedroom with a huge bed and sofas. It was spectacular.  The little…
July 2022,Week stay at the 41,I just finished a week long stay at Hotel 41 with my wife and we are totally spoiled.From the time we were greeted the first day by Steve and Esma until checking out with Adele we felt like we were members of the family.Everyday started with a wonderful English breakfast and ended with a raid on the pantry for snacks late in the night.Our room was very comfortable and surprisingly quite and very convenient only steps to breakfast.The shower being a bit small was the only negative.Everyone was very helpful setting up diners and buying show tickets.The location was excellent right next to buckingham palace.We walked nearly everywhere and the Victoria tube station was just a block away.We can’t wait to visit again.
June 2022,Felt like we were staying at Buckingham Palace,"We stayed in two rooms with our two teenage sons for 5 nights last month on a two week UK trip and this was a delightful place to begin our adventure.  It is like a little secret and we felt completely at home there.  The rooms are a little bit on the small side, but were perfectly appointed and oh so comfortable.  We loved the food, and experienced all the meals including tea at some point during our stay.  We also loved being able to get delicious snacks and treats all day and evening and just were overall delighted by the staff, the location, the attention to detail and the feeling of home."
July 2022,Best Boutique Hotel In London,"All the positive reviews about this hotel were right on.  Staff is amazing (Steve, Ali and Deryn) and makes you feel like family with every interaction.   The Executive Room is a great place to hang out with tasty snacks around the clock.  Regular rooms aren't huge but super cozy.  Location is great next to Buckingham Palace and close to beautiful parks.  Would stay again at this over-achieving hotel time and time again!!"
December 2022,Another fabulous stay at the faultless Hotel 41,Outstanding- fabulous as always! Another wonderful stay at Hotel 41. I would not stay anywhere else. The team are faultless in the care they take of guests and the level of comfort and the efforts made to ensure guests have everything they need is exceptional.   There have been lots of new staff join in the last few months but many of the old team remain. The new team are of a very high standard - really pleased to see such high standards being maintained  Thank you
November 2022,Exclusive hotel,"Hotel 41 really is a unique hotel experience. As you enter the entrance hall and walk along the beautifully polished marble floors, and you are taken through to an elevator that takes you up to the executive lounge. You are provided champagne and canapes before checking in. The moment you arrive you are treated impeccably, and we were loved the intimacy of the hotel.    The room itself was lovely with some lovely finishes such as a welcome cake and macrons and overall impressions were very good.   Much to our own determent we had booked a number of experiences so did not fully use much of the hotel's unique points such as their plunder the pantry and evening canapes. We did however have delicious breakfasts when we could, and the staff were attentive and catered for any needs.  …"
November 2022,Incredible incredible incredible,"Everything at the hotel was EXCEPTIONAL. The hotel’s crew specially. They were all very caring and always available to help. It is very well located, the rooms are excelent and very clean.  Only the higher of compliments and hoping to stay there again soon!"
November 2022,Luxury and personal,"Stayed for 9 Nights so I got to experience the service and hotel over a long period.   Ad you can see from the photos, the hotel is gorgeous.   On arrival, a beautiful introduction in their executive lounge orients you to the sensory pleasures that await. Their team, headed up by Diarmaid, set out to make every person feel welcome and that they deserve being spoilt with an exceptional and personalised service.   If you are visiting the Uk/London and want to spoil yourself, stay at Hotel 41 where you will experience many others spoiling you too!"
November 2022,Perfect (again),"This is our fourth visit to Hotel 41 this year - that, in itself, should speak volumes.  The staff are amazing and cannot do enough to look after you.  Prior to ‘discovering’ Hotel 41, we have stayed at all of the ‘top’ hotels (Savoy, Connaught, Four Seasons, Shard, Ritz etc ….)  but this is now our ‘home from home’ in London. VERY highly recommended."
November 2022,Perfect stay,"Since the moment they open the door you feel like a home away from home. Their hospitality is exceptional. Every detail makes the difference when staying with them. Plus, the food is great and abundant. Walking distance from main attractions and their convenient advice is always  helpful. We'll definitely stay there again!!"
November 2022,First European Trip,"My Daughter & I enjoyed an amazing experience at this beautiful hotel! Impeccable service from the beginning to the end of our stay. Our room was definitely 5 star in every detail possible.   We were treated like royalty while enjoying complimentary champagne upon arrival, afternoon tea, wine & appetizers before dinner & also delicious English breakfasts!  The staff was very attentive, friendly & entertaining. We will definitely return on our next trip to London. Hotel 41 offers the best of every detail possible!"
November 2022,The hotel that exceeded our expectations,The entire experience was incredible. The check in was personal and easy and the welcome cocktail was much appreciated. The hotel itself was beautiful and comfortable. The lounge is very inviting. The rooms though on the small size were great.
November 2022,expectations exceeded,The service was the best that we have ever had.  We love boutique hotels and Hotel 41 did not disappoint. The rooms were lovely and the main room was inviting and warm. The location was a quick walk from Buckingham palace and Mayfair.
November 2022,Ruined!,"Attention grabbing but true. My stay at Hotel 41 was so incredible that it has certainly ruined almost any future hotel stay I have elsewhere. The purpose of my trip was a brief relaxation in luxury surroundings and it absolutely lived up to that. Although slightly overwhelming initially, the staff and glass of champagne soon help you feel comfortable.  The hotel and bedrooms were beautifully presented, but the star of the show, and the real differentiator, is the staff. The level of personalised service, genuine warmth and interest in you having everything you need sets this apart from any other hotel experience I have had.  I will absolutely be back in the future and can't wait!"
May 2022,The best hotel in London without question,"This is London's only real 5***** hotel. We have stayed at all of the others...the icons of Mayfair and  Park Lane but none compare with Hotel 41.  Hotel 41 has atmosphere, brilliantly trained and friendly staff, superb management, an Executive Lounge better than any private club. This is THE place to stay in London"
April 2022,Truly a hotel you want to experience!,"My wife and I just visited London and stayed at this marvelous hotel!  Its super nice and clean and the staff is impeccable!  Every detail is paid attention to,  and there is nothing lagging here.  It's a perfect location, you can easily get to the Victoria tube station in a short walk, as well as Hyde park and the palace.  The Hotel also has 3 restaurants attached that they own.  We tried the South African themed BnB grill next door and fell in love with it.  Definitely a good choice hotel to stay at!  We expect to stay here for all of our London trips!"
May 2022,I would never stay anywhere else!,"If you’re planning a trip to London please make sure you stay at the hotel 41. From the second you get there, the fabulous staff welcome you with champagne and your every need is taken care of , ensuring you have the best possible time . Steve is the epitome of calm and efficiency and always has a good tale to tell. Satish makes a mean margarita and Andrew is always good fun and professional in equal measures ! The rooms are all individual and unique with plenty of lovely extras all to enhance your stay so that you are already booking your next trip - on the journey home !"
October 2021,THE BEST PLACE TO STAY IN LONDON,I have stayed here  a lot  they have a thing called plunder the pantry for dinner time and there is judes farm ice  cream  the rooms are the best and confy beds  and good toileteries  it is close to victoria train station  the staff are kind and helpful and nice  they have coffie machines in the rooms  the brekfasts are good  i would recomend the pancakes and the eggs benidict  the rooms are really clean
April 2022,A wonderful club-like choice.,"A wonderful intimate hotel that feels like a private members club. The lounge is splendidly British, where you can spend hours as if it, in and of itself, was the purpose of the visit. Service is immaculate and the staff is beyond first class.  Cons: while bordering with Buckingham Palace, the street has a ""spillover"" sensation from bustle of Victoria Station.  Bottom line: Go, absolutely."
April 2022,Always brilliant!,"A quick 48 hours in a gem in a bustling city makes it feel like time is almost still. From the first Champaign upon arrival to the pantry our stay was brilliant. We decided to have breakfast both mornings and both meals were absolute perfection, every night was capped with cocktails in the lounge with sweets and snacks. We’ll be back again soon!"
April 2022,Great again!,"We stayed 3 nights at the end of our 3 week trip, we have traditionally stayed here at the beginning of our trips and staying at the end felt really special.  This trip started in Milan which is the only reason we didn't stay here at the beginning of the trip, once again the service was fantastic.  We really think of this as our home away from home, which is pretty strange because nobody serves us drinks, breakfast, makes reservations, etc at our house!  Anyway, we really enjoy the location, the evening banter with Steve is probably our absolutely favorite thing.  Ellie was new for us this trip, but she was also delightful!    I took some time and read the negative reviews before I wrote this review, there aren't many so it didn't take long.  I understand some of the viewpoints…"
April 2022,3 day stay,"Stayed for three days and must say this has been the most enjoyable experience one could have ever asked for. From the moment you turn up you are the most important thing, customer service on a different level. Champagne on arrival whilst booking in, room top quality, plunder the pantry excellent for nibbles with drinks during the day. I cannot thank everyone enough for a fantastic stay.   Hotel 41 staff excellent customer service."
April 2022,Another Brilliant stay,It’s fair to say we’ve stayed at 41 a few times. We treat this as our home-away-from-home in London. There are many great things: 1. The service level is always ‘just right’ 2. The staff are brilliant and nothing is ever ‘too much’. The fact that so many of them stay and turnover seems low says a great deal about the hotel and the ethos of the owners. I understand this as my staff only tend to leave when they have to. This keeps a stability and clients/guests love stability when they’re frequent users of a service. This marks 41 out against others who may choose to declare themselves as 5 star.  3. We’re not quite at the point of having stayed in every room but we have been in a lot of them and they’re all great with enough individuality to make them each of their own kind. I…
February 2022,"Exceptionally enjoyable experience, very personalised service, fabulous location and a taste of luxury.","Absolutely loved our stay, perfect location to explore London, however more importantly the standards of service along with the attention to detail, personal touches give this hotel the rating it deserves. Having stopped in many hotels across London this one is for me a favourite, the feel of a private members club. We will be back to plunder the pantry, delicious."
May 2022,We love this hotel!,It's been a few years since we have visited (pre pandemic) and it was so good to be back and to see that this hotel was just as lovely and the service was just as exceptional in these crazy times   This is our go to place in London.
May 2022,Hotel 41,"We booked this as an overnight stay for the theatre. The rooms were great, food was excellent & the location was perfect, however the best part was the service which was impeccable. I would go to the West-end just to stay there"
May 2022,"Amazing hotel, royal treatment and very unique.","This is not a 5 star hotel. More like 7. The whole experience is amazing. The staff were exceptional and the whole feeling of the place is an intimate private VIP club. Room is great and very comfortable. Location is fantastic. Can walk everywhere and Victoria station is right there. The snacks are fantastic. Only complaints is that I was introduced to a very fine red wine. So now, I have to try to get it in the US. You get the royal treatment. We stayed 4 nights. They helped us book a day trip to Bath.. I so recommend."
May 2022,Perfect 10,"Was I dreaming?...  Had the most amazing few days at Hotel 41 celebrating my birthday! From the moment I stepped foot into hotel 41, everything was a perfect 10.   A warm welcome in the lobby, and then greeted again with affection in the executive lounge and handed a glass of champagne, whilst hubby sipped a glass of merlot.  The room was cosy and clean, with a fire place and small seating area. All the expected amenities in a luxury 5 star pad, and added personal touches included a welcome letter, macaroons and birthday cake.  We enjoyed canapes and drinks before heading off to the cinema, returning to plunder the pantry with a bowl of hot chicken pie and salad, and naughty but nice desserts at midnight.  The turned down room awaited us, as the fire warmed our toes and we…"
May 2022,I honestly don’t think you could do better than 41….,"I’m not sure you can do better than the 41. This was a bit of a splurge for our 20th and it was worth every penny and then some. Though this is not our typical level of hotel, not once did anyone make us feel like we didn’t belong. All staff bent over backwards to make our stay as comfortable and memorable as possible. Rose petals and candles on the nightstands, a handwritten happy anniversary message on the mirror, a little something on the pillow every night….they know how to make you feel special. I am so glad I made this reservation and wouldn’t hesitate for a second to make it my first choice if we were to return to London one day."
May 2022,Small hotel with big personality,"Brilliant small hotel. Quirky layout of just 30 rooms allows a real sense of intimacy. I was there just 36 hours and was amazed to find staff knew my name, where I was heading next and what I’d done for the day. A bag of snacks sitting in my room before departure with a hand written note wishing me safe travels on my flight back to Australia. Very impressive"
May 2022,We will not stay anywhere else!,"Fabulous visit at Hotel 41!!!!!  We stayed there for 5 nights.  The location cannot be beat - we love to stroll through St. James Park and love to visit central London.  The service cannot be matched.  Each and every employee was knowledgeable, friendly, and caring.  Their evening turn down service was the best we’ve had anywhere in the world.  The calm environment and wonderful food and beverages in the Executive Lounge provided a calm start and end to our day - and afternoon tea allowed us to refresh before dinner.  Waking up in the states today and sooooo missing our lovely space there!  Thank you to the amazing staff who made our visit so special!!!"
May 2022,Truly Incredible Service,"We have vacationed in London many times in the past 10 years always staying in different locations, and staying at Hotel 41 was the absolute best experience we have ever had. The hotel itself is clean, the bar is available 24 hours, and the location allows for easy access to the whole city. But most of all, the entire staff team is incredible and absolutely made our trip so special. We were greeted each day to kind and helpful staff that made us feel like the most important guests onsite. We will absolutely be staying at Hotel 41 again in the future."
May 2022,Hotel 41,An absolute Fantastic hotel in centre of London. Champagne on arrival was a lovely touch. Outstanding service and very comfortable . Wonderful rod terrace. With drinks and canapés provided. Can’t wait to go again
May 2022,The best in London,"If you want anonymous luxury then head elsewhere, but if you want personalised luxury that somehow feels understated yet super lux then this boutique hotel ticks every box.  I’ve been visiting for several years and you’re always made to feel part of the family. This was a first time visit for my parents and the Hotel 41 team did not disappoint. Even by Hotel 41 standards they were superb, always seeking to give the best possible experience.  It’s certainly not cheap, but it’s an experience and you quickly realise the value the team provide."
December 2021,Every stay is amazing!,"I've been staying at 41 almost every year for the past 10+ years, and I keep coming back for the amazing decor, the beautiful rooms, the unmatched friendliness of the staff and the level of service that is simply above and beyond every other hotel I have ever experienced. This is simply the best hotel, not just in London, but the world, as far as I am concerned.  A great place to stay year round, although my favourite time at 41 is always the cold winter months around Christmas to New Year's Day. The lounge is my favourite  place to relax at anytime of day, with a great selection of drinks.   The staff are amazing at recommending and securing dining reservations. I've had great experiences at restaurants I would have never found if not for the team's recommendations. They are…"
March 2022,What a Treat!,"This is a fabulous hotel with beautiful decor, which is comfortable and luxurious. But the thing that sets it apart is the staff.  They all manage to make you feel as if you are their special guest, maintaining a friendly, relaxed manner as they do all they can to make you feel at home...but a pampered home! We have been to celebrate some special occasions over the years and have never been disappointed."
April 2022,Another Fabulous Stay,"From the moment of arrival to departure, our stay was perfect. The outstanding staff ensured we were looked after in this beautifully luxurious hotel. We are regulars and always made to feel like valued customers."
April 2022,I'd forgotten how good it is,"It really is a cut above everything else. The rooms are amazing, but it's the team that makes it amazing, nothing is too much trouble and they seem able to anticipate your every need. I can't recommend enough!"
April 2022,Well Worth It!!,"Wow, just wow! What an exceptional experience we had. We were brought a night away by my partners mother as an early wedding present as we are getting married in June. We didn’t know what to expect as we have never stayed in a London 5* hotel before and this one did not disappoint!  From the moment we stepped in the staff were so courteous and helpful.  We were taken to the Hotels lounge where we were greeted again, but lovely staff, a glass of champagne and some nibbles.  We were left to relax and unwind by the fire which is lovely when you just arrive into London.  The staff were asking us about our stay and we mentioned our wedding was in a couple of months to which they went above and beyond to make our stay magic.  They upgraded our room, and made lovely little gestures…"
March 2022,Brilliant place to stay!,"We were looking for a special place to stay for my husband's 60th birthday weekend and from the moment we stepped into this hotel, we were transported to a different world. Everything is elegantly decorated and the staff very welcoming and friendly.   We were welcomed with a glass of good champagne and snacks (the olives had been marinated and were amazing!). We were then taken to our room which was lovely and had every extra in the room you could think of. I have not stayed in a hotel room with so many extras!  The hotel generously offered free snacks and chocolates in their dining room which we could help ourselves to at any time. It is well situated and fortunately quiet enough to enjoy our night's sleep in the very comfy bed.   Highly recommended!"
March 2022,Unbelieveable,"My wife and I stayed at the 41 on Saturday/Sunday 19th/20th March. Only thing I can say is, it is absolutely amazing! The staff, the building, the rooms are all out of this world. The food was superb although we only had breakfast, and ""plundered the pantry"" on a couple of evenings. The full english breakfast was exquisit. The room was fab, and the romantic turndown was the icing on a particularly super cake. I can't praise this Hotel and the staff highly enough. They made a super weekend into something we will never forget. Thank you all, and we WILL see you again soon."
March 2022,One of the best parts of our trip to England!,"We wish we could rate this hotel even more than 5 stars as our whole family (4 teenagers and two adults) cannot stop raving about the entire experience. The people (from servers to concierge), food, location, rooms could not be better. There is a cozy “living room” that serves as a meeting place in the evenings where drinks, food and free ice cream (the teens loved this) were served. We played cards there as a family every night as we had 3 rooms. Each of our rooms were different but all cozy. The hotel did the little things- like notes written in the mirror for the kids- well and made us feel at home for our visit. We cannot thank Hotel 41 enough for making our kids’ first trip to London so memorable. We had a friend from home insist we stay here and it exceeded our…"
March 2022,A hotel that lives up to its promise,"From the moment you arrive you’re made to feel welcome & the staff do an amazing job to make your stay feel special.   From check in to check out nothing is too much for them and the hotel is full of lovely surprises.   From the welcome glass of champagne to afternoon tea & the croque monsieur to the evening delights, this is without all the goodies available to help yourself too throughout the day (the black coconut ice cream is delightful).   The hotel itself is spacious & the rooms are comfortable & luxurious, there’s even a little surprise when you arrive in there too.   The drinks menu is vast with a good selection cocktails and whilst we didn’t eat in the hotel, there are good food options in and around.  The choice at breakfast was also vast, everything looked great, we…"
March 2022,Penny Square Restaurant,"I had dinner at the main restaurant, Penny Square, It was lovely. Great tasty food. Definitely a must try in East London. Received a very attentive service by Konrad and Matyas, amazing guys. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone."
March 2022,We know why it's always #1!,"We have been staying at the Hotel 41 for years. And after every stay, we remember why we we always come back. It's a true 5 star experience. The staff remembers you throughout the stay and is always welcoming and accommodating.  It's like staying in a posh London manor where you are a house guest. Feels warm and intimate but you don't lose your privacy as in a bed and breakfast. Every room is insulated from noise and other guests. Yet, the inviting lounge is just steps away and open 24/7. We especially like the lounge hosts where every request is met with ""of course, right away"". A special shout to Steve, one of the lounge hosts, and who is a main reason we come back year after year."
March 2022,Attentiveness of staff was exemplary.,"A hidden gem. Small hotel that really makes you feel at home. Staff were unbelievably attentive and hospitality of the hotel amazing. Exceeded our expectations in many ways.  Whilst the facilities were limited the hotel made up for in many other ways. The rooms were spacious and clean, executive lounge welcoming."
February 2022,Fantastic Stay for a Special Birthday with Friends,What a fantastic hotel. Absolutely 10/10 on all fronts which made a very special birthday even more amazing. They make hospitality look easy. Felt like home from home. Location in Victoria on Buckingham Palace Road again was spot on for what we needed. Highly recommend Hotel 41!!
February 2022,third time at this hotel,great location to Victoria underground and theatres  fantastic service from the hotel  nice touch with the hot water bottle in the bed   very friendly staff always willing to help will be back again highly recommend
February 2022,Top class stay!,"Absolutely outstanding customer service! Amazing rooms and top class hospitality. I really couldn’t fault it. The food, the room, the facilities, the staff, the location. We were made to feel very special, I would highly recommend this hotel. Nothing was too much trouble!"
February 2022,I can't wait to go back!!!,"This hotel was amazing! My husband surprised me with a trip to London for our 5 year anniversary and we stayed here at Hotel 41!! The room and staff were amazing. They were so friendly and accommodating! They brought us special treats to celebrate our anniversary (and Valentines day) it was perfect! The stuff knew the places to go and the advice they gave us on things to see and places to eat were fantastic, we were impressed! We wanted the full London experience from Sunday roast to bar hopping in Soho (try the Pornstar Martini it is the best). We can't wait to go back this will be our forever spot to stay!!! Thank you so much for making this a wonderful trip for us! We've told all our friends and hope they visit too!! I have to be honest Hotel 41 was our first stop of this…"
February 2022,Short break to London,"Look no further than Hotel 41 if you are looking for an excellent stay in a wonderful hotel based in the heart of London, with Buckingham Palace just a few minutes walk down the road. The hotel is superb, with very friendly staff, where nothing is too much trouble to make your stay a fantastic experience. Very upmarket and would highly recommend. With regards the staff, we have stayed in many hotels around the world and would consider Hotel 41 to be the most courteous."
February 2022,Praise where praise is due,We stumbled upon Hotel 41 by accident over 10 years ago.  We have been privileged to stay in some exclusive hotels but have learnt a simple fact. Hotels are only buildings it’s the staff that make the difference between that simple fact and a memorable experience and this is where Hotel 41 exceeds.  It is our 9th stay here and wewould like to say again a big thank you to all at Hotel 41
February 2022,Truly 5 star.,"Best hotel I’ve ever stayed in in the UK. The service is attentive and friendly, yet not intrusive or annoying. The complimentary snacks in the pantry were a great detail and the birthday cake and sleep spray left in our bedroom were a lovely touch. The breakfast was amazing, a mixture of cooked and continental, with a lot to choose from. Also the hotel is in a great destination, 5 mins from Victoria station and 5 mins from Buckingham palace. I would love to come back soon, hopefully in the summer to try out their rooftop terrace bar/garden!"
February 2022,City break for birthday made extra special by a special hotel,Exceptional hotel with the friendliest and most helpful staff I have encountered. We went to some shows for my birthday and surprises and treats were left in the room that added to the experience. The hotel is next to Buckingham Palace and we were treated like royalty. Nothing was too much trouble. Phenomenal breakfast and very attentive waiting staff. I would highly recommend. We stayed an extra night due to a cancelled flight and fortunately another room was available.  This was my second visit to 41 and we will definitely be back. Can’t recommend highly enough.
January 2022,Great Hotel and excellent service,"The hotel is very well located, close to many landmarks.  Even though the hotel is central, our room was very quiet. The staff was very helpful and really nice. I think this is what makes this hotel special, the service and the attention from the staff. My wife was pregnant during our stay and we were upgraded (without any request) to a suite.  The breakfast was also very good. It is a la carte and the choice is pretty large. Overall, we really had a good time in this Hotel."
January 2022,A hidden gem,What a wonderful hotel this is and we have stayed in many London hotels.  The staff are phenomenal and make your stay so special.  The rooms are lovely and the executive lounge is very special. Staff are extra attentive and the food was fabulous. The afternoon tea was out of this world.  We loved our stay and can’t wait to go back. Very special staff who I can’t name all but Shatish who looked after us at breakfast was so attentive and kind.  Andrew looked after us so well throughout and the young man that looked after us for afternoon tea. The girls were lovely and always made sure we had everything. Thank you.
January 2022,Still our no. 1 Hotel in London!,"I don't begin to understand the algorithm that TripAdvisor uses to determine which is the ""best"", but I imagine percentages of scores and cost are high on the list of considerations. After staying at this delectable hotel about half a dozen times, I took it slightly personally when I saw ahead of our latest visit that Hotel 41 had been knocked off the top of the list. Upon reading some of the usurper's reviews I concluded that the thing that was missing from the no.1 hotel at the time is the one thing that makes Hotel 41 exceptional: the personal service. We're not rich by any stretch of the imagination, but seven years ago my now husband chose to take me to the top rated hotel for my birthday when he proposed, and the special memories created there draw us back every year for a…"
January 2022,An experience we'll never forget.,"Beautiful hotel, but the biggest asset is the intimacy and feeling the place evokes. This is a different League of experience that if you compare to other London attractions is actually incredibly good value in relation to the time you spend here. We were here for my wife's 40th and the staff made every effort to make it special.  If you want to treat yourself and experience london in style, I highly recommend this place."
January 2022,What a special place,Where to start! The staff at this hotel really make the best experience ever! From arrival to when you leave there is always someone to assist you.  We spent one night for our sons birthday. In his room was a birthday cake. Champagne on arrival by the fire.  The pantry treats are available all day then hot food in the evening with other delights too! We ate in the curry room in the adjoining Rubén’s hotel but part of the same group. Staff from hotel 41 took us to the restaurant through secret doorways! The curry room again was a great experience with champagne on arrival and more birthday cake. We returned to the executive lounge and spent the rest of the evening in a relaxed atmosphere with drinks by the fire. Talking with staff and in particular Andrew Muir. It was our…
January 2022,Wonderful Hotel,Wonderful hotel. Certainly deserves the 5 star rating. The staff were courteous and very helpful. The facilities were second to none. Great location. I would definitely recommend this hotel and am very much looking forward to staying again.
January 2022,Creating memories with Hotel 41,Wow what an amazing hotel.  My husband and I were totally spoilt from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.  Nothing is too much trouble and the desire of everyone to ensure your stay is perfect is authentic and very much appreciated.   From the fabulous upgrade to the tasty treats and first class breakfast - all the little touches are what sets Hotel 41 apart.  We have a weekend of memories and want to say a massive thank you to everyone.
January 2022,Just had two wonderful nights at the gem that is Hotel 41.,"Just had two wonderful nights at the gem that is Hotel 41. Not my first stay but my first solo visit to meet with chums for some post lockdown retail therapy. The amazing team made me so welcome, just like coming to a second home. As always the room was fabulous, with everything a girl could need and although in the centre of London I slept exceptionally well.  The food is great, the lounge larder is plentiful and extremely tasty, especially after a very tiring day shopping. The extremely thoughtful staff even made sure my room had bath salts and relaxation sleep spray to help me chill out. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel - simply put its wonderful!"
January 2022,Outstanding hotel and service.,"Beautiful hotel, with a lovely room and a wonderful lounge in which to relax and enjoy food and beverages. It also had by far the best service we have ever experienced, surpassing that of any other 5-star hotel we have stayed at in Europe or North America. Perfect for any special trip or occasion, and I greatly appreciated celebrating my birthday here. This is now our hotel of choice in London."
January 2022,Perfection,We visited Hotel 41 this past weekend for the second time. It was even better than I remembered.   The attentive staff and incredible service make this hotel the gem that it is.   All of the little touches are just perfection. I was there to celebrate my birthday and I felt so special and spoilt from the moment I arrived to the moment I left. The car journey home was even made better by the hot chocolates they sent us away with.   We will back as soon as we can find an excuse!
February 2022,"Always excellent, Londons number 1 hotel","The hotel is amazing,The staff are wonderful from the minute you walk in the door until you checkout, the beds are super comfy and I always have a fab nights sleep,  I would fully recommend Hotel 41 - to my family it is the number 1 hotel in London + we would not stay anywhere else. Excellent customer service from all especially Andrew, Adele, and Marlin and Dean"
February 2022,Just perfect,Usually we stayed in another 5 star hotel in London. This time we decided to stay here which was really a great decision. Its a small very familiar hotel with a unique concept in service. The attention to detail is incredibly!! The turndownservice with turning on the fireplace. Light up a candle in the bathrom and preparing the tv is unique. We‘re definitly gonna come back in this hotel!
October 2021,Another impeccable stay at Hotel 41,"I travelled to London mid October of 2021; issues with the pandemic had made travel and accommodations difficult; however as always Hotel 41 stepped up to help me in each and every way. I had a significant delay with my flat rental and needed to find a place for an additional two weeks duration; the staff stepped up to make sure I was well taken care of and that I had a good place to stay for this extended period. The service was once again amazing. I can't rate Hotel 41 high enough, and give it my highest recommendation."
February 2022,Our love affair with Hotel 41,"It was a cold winters night when my husband and I checked into Hotel 41 having had an awful experience in another hotel that shall remain nameless, and that’s when the love affair with Hotel 41 began. From the  staffs attention to every detail, the cosy luxury of the rooms; the beautiful signature aroma; turndown with a hot water bottle;;great service; fab location…I could go on. We go back at every opportunity, and we live in London! Our favourite boutique hotel without a doubt!  Thank-you for the memories Hotel 41! Carol & Paul"
February 2022,Like a Private Club,"I travel a lot and stay in many hotels. I’ve been privileged enough to stay in many exceptional hotels. Hotel 41 may be the best hotel I have ever had the pleasure of staying in! It feels like a private club. The hotel is small and exceptionally well decorated. The staff is beyond!, they each know your name immediately and  have a way of providing service that is warm and never stuffy or elite.  The room I had was wonderful with the most comfortable bed. I received personal notes and small gifts  each night of my stay. There was even a hot bottle warming my sheets when I returned at night. The executive lounge is amazing. Small but well appointed, it’s where you check in, eat breakfast, grab a drink or tea or whatever you want to eat. And after hours? There’s more food available…"
February 2022,Another amazing weekend at Hotel 41,"A huge thank you to all the staff at Hotel 41 for making Hannahs birthday so relaxed, fun and enjoyable. There is no other hotel like it, not only in London but anywhere around the world, and we travel a lot. This is the definition of relaxed top tier service. There is nothing to fault. Until next time. Thank you, Pete"
February 2022,Loved it,Noisy which was annoying but loved my stay at this hotel as staff were nice and my husband and I felt welcomed at all times would recommend any time as i will be coming back when i come back from france
February 2022,Perfect - 10/10 for Hotel 41!,"A wonderfully luxurious home from home - simply the best! Nothing is too much trouble for the amazing team at Hotel 41. From the minute a guest arrives until checkout - everything is superb.  Check in is the best ever with a complimentary glass of fizz, rooms are superbly comfortable with gorgeous Floris toiletries, complimentary chocolates & Nespresso machine.  In the evening there is either an a La carte menu and the lovely complimentary Plunder the Pantry - served at the table because of Covid precautions.  All in all - it’s perfect at Hotel 41 and my family & I love it!"
February 2022,Perfect Birthday weekend,"We arrived for my surprise birthday and I can honestly say it was the best weekend I have ever had. From the moment we arrived we were greeted with a glass of champagne. The room was perfect with everything you needed. We relaxed in the executive lounge in the evenings, in front of the fire with a glass of espresso martini along with the selection of evening snacks, including my favourite, the truffle Camembert. The staff were amazing! On my actually birthday all the staff wished me a happy birthday and I even received a little cake in my room. I can honestly say that this was the best experience and I will be returning"
February 2022,1st visit but definitely not the last ,"Booked directly with hotel and almost immediately received the customer preference email so was able to choose any particular type of beverage, or preferences that would make our stay special.  It was a lovely touch that immediately made us feel valued.    The hotel check in, from the front desk downstairs to the complimentary glass of champagne whilst taking in the rich surroundings of the executive lounge immediately set the tone.  The friendliness and attention to detail every single member of staff afforded us means Hotel 41 is somewhere we will definetly return.  The pantry with it's never ending supply of complimentary snacks is such a lovely treat as was the turn down service complete with lit fire and hot water bottle in the room, (much appreciated on a cold, damp night…"
November 2021,Thankful in London!,"The staff and attention to detail is unmatched. Before and during our visit we were given the utmost care. Charming rooms, the executive suite warm & lovely and staff engaging & thoughful. Proper elegance but not stuffy. A great holiday away from the States!"
November 2021,Another Wonderful Stay at 41,"We were ""welcomed home"" when we walked into 41 last Sunday. As usual, we sat with a glass of champagne in the executive lounge during check-in. When we we shown to our room, everything was absolutely perfect. The staff here cannot do enough for guests and really spoil you. Reservations were made for a very nice tapas restaurant, a short walk from the hotel. By the way, the Christmas lights on Regent, New Bond and Carnaby Streets were absolutely fantastic and worth a special pre-Christmas visit. After a great night with a very comfortable sleep, we enjoyed a superb breakfast (eggs Benedict and lattes are highly recommended). Afternoon tea service was quick and expertly presented. We had dinner next door later next door at BBar, which was up to the high standard of 41. We…"
November 2021,One of the most exceptional hotel experiences ever.,"There was no detail too small.  My wife and I recently stayed at 41 for two days of our trip, and our only regret was not booking the hotel for the entirety. Andrew Muir handled our check-in, and is a consummate professional, He provided us with every bit of information we needed and handled all of our requests. I am someone who has been fortunate to stay at many top tier hotels around the globe, and 41 is at the top of the class. Thank you so much to Andrew and the entire team at 41. Sammy H"
December 2021,Unique & very special,"We absolutely loved our stay at Hotel 41, & found everything about it exceptional & very unique. We have walked past this Hotel & even stayed at Rubén’s next door without even knowing it was there, but now we have discovered this absolute gem of a place we will definitely be coming back…(have already booked for the Summer when the roof top bar will hopefully be open). Service is attentive, Food & Cocktails are delish & the whole Executive Lounge grazing experience is a great foodie treat. Rooms are beautifully decorated & the attention to detail surpassed all our expectations, from chocs in the room on arrival to a hot water bottle in the bed & tea lights glowing in the bathroom. Small but beautifully formed, Hotel 41 could teach some of the big name 5 star London Hotels a trick…"
December 2021,Wonderful experience,"We stayed at the hotel with our dog for a few days and thoroughly enjoyed it. The service from every member of the team was impeccable - incredibly welcoming, helpful and thoughtful. Not only were we pampered by the team but our dog was too. He had toys, bottled water and treats, and the team treated him like a member of the family. The executive lounge was particularly cosy, and the daily snacks were not only delicious, but were a perfect accompaniment to the wide range of drinks available to help us unwind after a busy day. The food available from the menu in the executive lounge was of good quality.   This was the first time we stayed at the hotel and we can’t believe we have  not stayed here before. It is really a hidden gem in terms of the amazing service, comfortable rooms…"
November 2021,A wonderful Thanksgiving,"Another magical stay at Hotel 41. The staff is just above and beyond. Andrew and Diana made our visit perfect, secured all our reservations and were just brilliant  with service each day. I highly recommend Hotel 41 for any and all visits to London. Such a great location and staff. Best hotel we have ever stayed at on holidays and family trips. Thank you for the details each day, a wonderful time and the memories!!!"
March 2021,Very Nice!,I really enjoyed my stay there. Very beautiful and welcoming Hotel The room was very big and beds were nicely arranged . My whole family enjoyed the stay. But the price is too much.it should be reduced. We will be back definitely!
November 2021,Heaven on Earth,The place to stay in London great location .The staff and service you receive are truly amazing from the minute you enter the front door you are treated as part of the hotel 41 family . The hotel has a guest lounge  with a working fire where you can relax and use the facility they call raid the pantry where treats are available all day and evening to enjoy
November 2021,Luxury Treat,"Decided to seek out a luxury but intimate hotel for a trip to London.  Hotel 41 is a perfect choice, the staff are smart,unfailingly helpful and always smiling.  The bedroom was immaculate and no detail overlooked.  The decor is one of an exclusive gentleman's club and the food and cocktails first class.  Andrew made us feel at home from the first moment and you can tell that the management of this hotel has got the boxes ticked.  Ideally situated for walking to the many attractions, we took taxis from the railway station but in future would use the underground as Victoria is literally round the corner.  Top Hotel,  you will not be disappointed!"
November 2021,"Hotel 41, simply the best.","This hotel is truly one of London’s best kept secrets. Having stayed several times now, I simply wouldn’t choose anywhere else. Writing a review only reveals it to more people but it is truly exceptional.  From the management team down, there is nothing here that I could fault. From Andrew at the helm to Steve in the lounge, everyone is friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and skilled. An extraordinary group of workers.  The location, the food, the decor , the rooms, the “vibe”and the service - all exceptional.  Guests are made to feel extremely special, nothing is too much trouble, and goodness we’ve tried.  We’ve stayed in many many places all over the world, but hotel 41 is still the best and our favourite."
January 2022,Perfect 10,"From the moment you step into this hotel to the moment you step out- it's simply perfect. The staff make this hotel what is it. They welcomed us back with a smile and added a lovely touch by stocking a new non-alcoholic champagne- pink bubbles! We had another surprise with a complimentary upgrade; a stunning room with lounge, and the added touch of a welcome letter from the assistant resident manager Dean. Early evening, before our theatre trip, we enjoyed canapes and cocktails in the executive lounge, where staff are on hand to meet any request, discreet, professional, and dignified.  Returning from our outing, we were welcomed back as we plundered the pantry; duck, mango, and sweet potato fusions tempted us, followed by a slice of the famous hotel 41 chocolate cake, as the…"
January 2022,It doesn't get any better! ,"What an amazing and stunning hotel this is. I'm not easily pleased but this hotel and all the staff were above our expectations! From the point of arrival,  the welcome we received from the staff and how at ease we felt in the opulant surroundings it was just  perfect. We stayed for just one night (new years eve) as we were to see the new year in on the belmond british pullman. Victoria Station is literally just a 5 min walk so made it perfect. The breakfast the following day was spot on as was the service from the staff. Honestly can't fault 41 at all and will definitely be back for another stay. Well done and thankyou for an amazing time All @41"
January 2022,We treat hotel 41 as our holiday primarily and the sites of London secondarily,"We have been going to Hotel 41 in London for about 20 years. It is a very special yet luxurious hotel. The lovely people that work there have an innate ability to read your mind to cater to you. Just outstanding service from the street level front desk, to the lobby front desk, the ""butler"" in the lounge etc etc. We are always treated special here. We sometime do not even leave the property and get pampered in the lobby."
November 2021,Birthday weekend,This was our first visit to 41 and it won’t be our last. The room was excellent and the Staff were exceptional and made the stay one to remember. We were made to feel at home from the beginning and nothing was to much for them to make the stay memorable.
December 2021,Wonderful!,"After almost 2 years, one of the things we have missed most was a stay at Hotel 41.  We were able to travel to London this month and the hotel is still, in a word, perfect!  It felt like coming home to a lovely environment and a staff that is unsurpassed."
December 2021,Exclusive hotel and a best kept secret the moment you walk in and get directed to the 5th floor your experience starts,This is a special place the feel is just tremendous the staff so warm and welcoming you will not be disappointed - the intimacy and quality is outstanding our bedroom was lovely and well equipped our bathroom was quite small red carnation are good at doing a great job of looking after your needs
December 2021,Forget any of the big name hotels stay here! ,"This our third visit this year. We love 41, besides the elegance of the hotel, the staff really make this hotel so special, little things they do to make sure you are comfortable and have everything you need, making your stay perfect. This time we decided to bring out pet as the hotel is pet friendly, wow, do they spoil pets, on arrival we all get a glasses of champagne but your pet has a choice of pet beer or wine (lol), in the room they have a bed made up for them with toys etc. I'd go into more detail but I think you should just book a trip and stay here, you won't be disappointed.  To all the staff thanks again for all you did for us during our stay, have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year's "
November 2021,One of our favorite hotels in the world,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for 4 nights at the end of November.  We had stayed there in the past and decided to spoil ourselves and go back.  It was just as good as we remembered.  The rooms are beautiful and the executive lounge is really special - a warm, cozy place with yummy food and drinks. It's such a nice touch that guests are treated with a glass of champagne while checking in. The staff is wonderful.  The location is also great, perfect for walking lots of places but also very close to Victoria Station, where you can catch a train or The Underground. We will definitely return."
December 2021,1st visit was good..2nd visit was even better👍🌟,"Our 1st visit was back in July & I booked our 2nd visit very soon after I returned home. Fast forward to it December 10th👍.. Just like the July visit, we were warmly greeted at the front door & ushered up to the wonderful executive lounge, where the warm welcome continued. I'd booked a  champagne🥂 cream tea for 16:30, which was delivered with consumate style by Steve, who was also part of the 'Sabage entertainment' that was lead by Dean. All the 'goodies' on offer were ,as with everything else at #41, presented with courtesy & aplomb. Malcolm ( the general manager) has put together a staff team that always puts the customer 1st. We are already looking forward to  our next visit👍"
December 2021,"Without doubt the best hotel in London,amazing in every way, wonderful staff, excellent service with a fabulous ambience","We have been coming to this hotel for the past 5 years, it’s our Xmas treat and it never fails to live up to its excellent reputation. The staff are wonderful, Steve greets us every year like we are returning friends making us feel special in every way, over & above what you would get in any other top London hotel. Andrew is also an excellent host, all the staff here can’t do enough to make your stay wonderful The ambiance in the lounge is like a private club and the rooms are all beautiful  If you want a small luxury hotel with excellent service this is the place to come."
November 2021,Special birthday surprise,"An absolutely beautiful hotel. From the moment I made an initial enquiry the hotel staff were polite, friendly and very helpful. They answered my emails quickly and made several restaurants bookings for us. On arrival we were greeted by lovely staff and a glass of champagne. They had even provided a birthday cake and bottle of champagne in our room which was a lovely surprise. The hotel room was fabulous, luxurious and very clean. All of the staff were friendly, courteous and approachable. Nothing was too much trouble and they were always on hand to answer any queries. The breakfast was delicious with plenty of choice. The plunder pantry was amazing. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and will definitely be making a return visit."
November 2021,3 Day stay,"I can say without doubt this was one of the best hotel stays I’ve ever had and my wife and I have stayed in some nice places. The staff are without exception the friendliest people you could want to meet. The only way you can discern them from your closest friends are the uniforms. I would also like to give special mention to Steve Jones the Lounge Manager , a fantastic host. I would also like to mention the Assistant Manager Marlen for her assistance in booking up our next visit."
November 2021,Wonderful Hotel and outstanding service,"Thank you and your staff very much for making our stay truly wonderful, we enjoyed every minute of our trip from amazing welcome when we arrived to great service from all the staff during our stay. The attention to detail in the hotel and service was outstanding. We will definitely stay in Hotel 41 in the future."
November 2021,One night stay,"We stayed here for one night for a special birthday, all the staff at Hotel 41 were very friendly and helpful and made the stay a memorable one.  The hotel is discrete, but high class. All the interiors are manitained to the highest standard.  I would definately stay here again."
November 2021,A memorable experience ,"Fantastic hotel with absolutely fantastic staff.  Great location and really good rooms. Bed was superb, bathroom excellent.  But the staff make all the difference, and elevate the experience from a city break to something a little more special. "

November 2021,41 has to be the friendliest hotel in London.,"This was our second time at 41 and once again it was outstanding. In our opinion the best hotel in London.  It was only fitting to return to the place we got engaged 12 months ago, for our London mini moon.  From the moment we arrived, the attention to detail by every member of staff was exemplary. We were made to feel so very welcome by Adele, Lauren and the whole team. This really is a special place. Looking forward to a return trip soon.  Thank you for making our few days with you so special"
November 2021,Fantastic Hotel,"The professionalism of the staff , the quality of the service, the rooms , location and the little unexpected touches go to make this one of the best , if not the best hotel we have stayed in and well deserved of the 5* Forbes rating.  From the moment we stepped  through the front door we knew were in for a treat.  We had two rooms and had booked for an Anniversary and birthday celebration.  We were mainly looked after by Andrew, who was very helpful , engaging and had a very natural flair , nothing was too much trouble and Dean who was also polite and attentive.  The small details for me are the main reason this Hotel is outstanding, the turn down service treats, the cake for the celebrations, the chocolates, the hot water bottle tucked in your bed to name but a few and not to…"
November 2021,Blown Away,"Well, I know a lot has been written about Hotel  41  but I just need to add our experience of this wonderful place.  We drove from Edinburgh to London, 1st time driving, and when we arrived at 41 the organisation was flawless.  We were met by a very smart red coated concierge and porter who just whisked our luggage away, and the car just vanished for the next 5 days. Super service and a nice welcome to both Hotel 41 and London.   We proceed into Hotel 41, again a lovely welcome from the guest relations and then we proceeded to the lounge.  On entering, again more warm welcomes and made comfortable in this lovely space.  No sooner had we sat down when we were approached by the lounge host, Mr Steve Jones, a glass of champagne was offered along with canapes, and we immediately…"
October 2021,Anniversary treat,"Superb service, friendly efficient staff. Lovely old english charm with comfortable, cosy rooms. Recommend the Curry room and the chefs banquet. Definitely be returning. The wife really appreciated all the little touches organised by the hotel."
October 2021,"This hotel is beyond a ""Star Rating"" - this is a Supernova standard hotel","Myself and my partner decided to stay at Hotel 41 for a couple of nights after we got married in a private ceremony. From the moment you arrive at the entrance of the hotel you are greeted by the most incredible signature smell as well as three members of staff, the concierge, the doorman and a member of staff who guides you through the hotel taking you straight up to the Executive Lounge. If you're lucky enough you will then be left in the hands of Steve Jones who will seat you down in the beautifully decorated and intimate room and offer you a complimentary glass of Larson's Champagne alongside cheese straws, olives and pecans. Steve then explained to us that all bottled water, crisps, popcorn, ice creams, scones, pastries, chocolate and cheese found in the Executive Lounge…"
September 2021,The perfect date night,"Where do I start? This was our second visit to Hotel 41 and somehow it was even better than the first!  Due to the pandemic, our previous two bookings had to be rearranged. We got engaged at Hotel 41 on the 18th December 2015 and have always wanted to return and last month we finally got there. What makes it special, beyond the beautiful decor, attention to detail, delicious food, etc, is the exceptional service. Somehow, the staff make every guest feel they are their most valued customer and they will go above and beyond to ensure you have the best possible experience.  We were welcomed by Erica and shown to the lift. As soon as we entered the lounge, Lauren welcomed us, ensured we were comfortable and brought the champagne trolley over so we could enjoy our first bit of luxury…"
August 2021,Beautiful hotel,"The reviews don't lie. Everything about this hotel is absolutely wonderful. It's located near Buckingham Palace and is really a hotel within a hotel. The rooms are spacious for London standards and are all well-appointed. The housekeeping is fantastic - I'm pretty observant and nothing was every missed in cleaning. The lobby / lounge are is a great meeting point and the fact there is always ice cream, snacks, drinks available makes it really enjoyable. However, as others have noted, what really sets this place apart is the service. definitely coming back here"
September 2021,A Special Place,"We were made to feel very special, and were upgraded to a suite which was very unexpected and very tastefully decorated and comfortable.

It was simply wonderful from start to finish."
October 2021,Not just a hotel but an experience!!,"This isn’t just a hotel, this is an experience!! A genuine haven of peace and luxury in the heart of bustling London!   The team at Hotel 41 were impeccable in their service, professionalism and creativity in making our trip unforgettable. We stayed at the hotel for four nights in October for a wedding anniversary and the team couldn’t do enough to help us plan the visit. The hotel itself is a stunning place to relax and unwind after a busy day in the capital. The rooms are first class, the executive lounge feels like a home from home and the staff brilliantly friendly. The Red Carnation Hotel group have a unique ability to make you feel like one of the family with welcoming and warm engagement but doing so with a poise that doesn’t feel too over familiar.   It was a wonderful…"
October 2021,The best  hotel in Britain,"This is our 1st visit to hotel 41, but not the last. It was our 39th wedding anniversary and    l must say the staff could not do enough to make our stay the best it could be. They went way beyond our expectations to make our celebration so special.

Quite simply the best hotel experience we have ever had."
October 2021,Wonderful hotel,"We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41. It was a late birthday celebration, but well worth the wait. The staff were so professional and friendly from the minute we arrived. On checking in we were given a complimentary glass of champagne  which they offer to all guests. A lovely surprise was the upgrade to the Balmoral Suite and chocolate cake and a box of chocolates to celebrate my birthday. The hotel itself is decorated to the highest standard. Plenty of choice for breakfast and so tasty. We couldn't fault our stay and will definitely be back for another visit."
September 2021,Second stay; Look forward to the next!,"We had our first experience at Hotel 41 last year and booked again for our latest trip to London. As lovely as the rooms and common areas are, it is truly the staff that make this hotel experience top-tier. The staff's attention to preferences and personal touches raise the bar on service. The rooms are comfortable, well-appointed, and make it feel like a home away from home. We'll be back again on our next trip, without question!"
October 2021,Fabulous,Absolutly perfect! This is a hidden gem at the back of Buckingham palace. The bedroom we stayed in was lovely and the executive lounge such a nice place to relax!  The best was the “whatever whenever” dial in on the phone… made any request possible!
October 2021,Amazing,"We don’t ever write reviews but felt that we had to for Hotel 41. It really is amazing. Special thanks to Andrew for taking such good care of our dog Chester and to Steve for the best expresso and bespoke Martinis.

October 2021,Best in London,"This was my 3rd stay at Hotel 41 and it didn’t disappoint. This place is truly special. This is mainly due to the fantastic team that work here, nothing i:”s too much trouble and I don’t think you can better the service they provide.  What is really unique is the Plunder Pantry where you have complimentary treats and snacks all day in the lounge area which is for hotel guests only. There is also a stunning terrace area. The rooms are beautiful and immaculately clean.  I truly wouldn’t stay anywhere else in London and look forward to my next stay."
October 2021,Wonderful,"We arrived to a glass of champagne and a wonderful upgrade to a suite. We extended our stay as we had had a train journey to Venice cancelled. If you want excellence, this is the ideal hotel for you. Staff very courteous and always ready to suggest things to enhance your stay. We intend to return next October when we hope to have our trip to Venice. We have never stayed in the same hotel twice which is an indication of just how good this establishment. You will not be disappointed."
October 2021,It was fine but not outstanding,"We stayed for a week for our 25th wedding anniversary and booked through Costco Travel.  We were looking at Hotel 41 and The Savoy and I was won over by the reviews and website which said that the service was outstanding and you would feel like it was your home.  We did not experience that at all in fact the canine customers had a better level of service than we did.  Other than one employee (Bethany) no one knew our names, no one made any effort whatsoever to engage with us.  We were in the Executive Lounge one day (that was enough) in the afternoon and got drinks but no refills.  Everyone else was being engaged and we finally realized that we were the ""scholarship kids"" and since our room was on discount we were the bottom feeders.    I will say that everyone was polite, no…"
October 2021,"Great stay, we hope to stay again","We stayed here 1 night. What a wonderful hotel! Across the street from Buckingham Palace, and walkable to lots of sights and attraction, at least it was for us as we like a walk if its dry. Enter at street level, leave your bags and up to 5th floor check-in, with a nice glass of champers. This is in the executive lounge, where nibbles and breakfast are served. Food of various sorts available all day. Easy peasy check-in, then shown to our room  which was spacious, usual amenities plus electric blinds. Nice anniversary cake too! Thank you for the special touches. We missed the scones in the afternoon as we were out, but canapes from 5pm were very nice 3 each. Plunder the pantry had a cheese, biscuits, salad pots and cakes. Bottled water available all day, alcoholic drinks on the…"
October 2021,Centrally located boutique hotel with outstanding service,Hotel 41 is a quiet boutique hotel situated on the top floor of the same building as the Rubens Hotel but with its own entrance.  Exceptionally attentive and friendly staff give every client individual personal service.  We were welcomed with a glass of champagne in the comfortable lounge where the excellent breakfasts are also served and refreshments are available throughout the day. There is a rooftop garden with views over London.  Like all London hotels 41 is expensive but the outstanding staff and their attention to detail make it excellent value for money.
October 2021,Hotel 41 - what a hotel 5*,"This is by far the best hotel I’ve ever stayed in and dog friendly too!  This was a special visit for our anniversary and wanted our dogs to join us for the occasion.  The service, from the point of booking, has been incredible.  All of the staff are polite and very helpful making our stay that extra impressive.  On arrival we were sat in the beautiful lounge, which is stunning and had a glass of champagne (pawsecco for the dogs).  There is a complimentary snack cart, which serves a variety of delicious foods throughout the day.  We were shown to our room and what a room it was.  I believe we had been upgraded and found a beautiful anniversary cake, chocolates and card on the side.  The dogs had their own bed with popcorn and treats as well as toys.    We had already planned a…"
September 2021,My New Favourite London Hotel,"I recently spent 2 nights at Hotel 41, this was a second attempt due to lockdown. I feel loathed to tell you how marvellous my stay was for fear of not being able to get a room when I next want to visit as there are only 28 of them.  Without exception all of the staff are excellent and without being overbearing, they ensure you have everything you need for a pleasant stay.  My husband and I booked the cinema for an afternoon movie with lots of fresh popcorn and pick n mix sweeties.  We literally felt like a couple of kids in a sweet shop and had a thoroughly good time watching the movie of our choice, do book it whilst you are staying, you are truly spoiled!  We cannot wait to return and have another indulgent couple of days feeling pampered and rested.  Bloomin well done Hotel…"
October 2021,Holiday,"My husband and I had the most amazing couple of days at Hotel 41,which is less than a minute from Bucking Palace. We were made to feel so welcome when we arrived. Andrew Muir who was front of house Was outstanding,we really enjoyed chatting to him,he is so charming & extremely knowledgable. Steve who is in charge of the beautiful club Lounge,greeted us with a glass of rose champagne & a bit later toasted sandwiches & other very English yummy food,like homemade scones with clotted cream & jam to boot.  All of the staff we met were truly amazing. We were upgraded to a suite,which we didn’t want to come out of,it was so cosy,especially when housekeeping lit the fireplaces. We really recommend this hotel,you will Love it. We cannot wait to come back."
September 2021,"A fantastic hotel, with a fantastic staff","I had the pleasure of staying in the hotel in two different occasions, the first in September and the second in October of this year. It is now my favorite place to stay in London, and I strongly recommend it to anyone visiting the city. The hotel itself is fantastic, the location, the attention to details and the staff. Adele and Lauren take care of all your needs with a smile. They are always present and concerned with your experience in the hotel, but also in the city. I am already planning my next visits to London, and I will certainly stay in the hotel."
September 2021,Living proof that you can smile despite a mask,"You can't get better than this for these strange times as we gradually,  carefully, and with hope, emerge from the pandemic.  Team 41 take great care of their guests and their staff, ensuring safety with luxurious comfort and discreet care over every detail.  Being 'resident only' ensures no through-flow of people, and small numbers that are easily spaced.    We were in London for a small, private event and we returned to 41 for the first time since before the pandemic - the first time anywhere - a long gap, and we have missed its charm and dedication to the very best in hospitality.  To walk through the doors again was like being enveloped in a cashmere wrap, and the glass of champagne arrives with an even warmer smile. The mask can't hide that.    The weather was lovely so we…"
September 2021,Fantastic stay,What a lovely hotel. Such lovely staff. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite for my partner’s belated 40th. So many lovely touches. Champagne on arrival. The Plunder Pantry went down well. Would stay again. A great location to visit many London attractions.
August 2021,A very special hotel…,"This beautiful hotel makes you feel special as soon as you arrive…. What better way to be welcomed than with a glass of champagne in the hotel lounge. The lounge area is the heart of the hotel where you can relax, enjoy amazing cocktails & canapés, and indulge in all the complimentary treats on offer (including ice cream) During our stay we were even lucky enough for the sun to come out so we could enjoy a drink at the roof top bar. Our executive king room was spacious, elegant and provided everything we needed for our two night stay. The hotel is situated in a great location (basically next door to Buckingham Palace) so we were able to walk everywhere and see so much of London but we also loved spending time in the hotel and relaxing. All the little details did not go…"
September 2021,Absolute perfection,"Ordinarily I wouldn’t review a hotel until after I’ve left but this visit was so exquisite to date I felt it only right that I give it the praise that it deserves. From answering the telephone addressing us by name prior to arrival to leaving a slice of anniversary cake.  I asked for a quiet room and that’s exactly what we got. Usually we bring the dog on holiday with us but he has an issue with doors banging and barks but no such problem, I’d certainly bring him here on the next visit. On returning from an evening out, water had been left by the bed, slippers too.  The remote controls sanitised again, a handmade soap and classic fm playing on the tv. What more could you want?"
September 2021,"Forget The Ritz or Claridge’s next time you stay in London, go to Hotel 41 instead!","5 out 5  Customer service second to none. All the staff we encountered were smiling, friendly and genuinely engaging without being overbearing or intrusive. Check-in was a breeze, not rushed, with a choice of white or pink champagne, nibbles & afternoon cream tea, as we arrived in time for this. White gloved serving staff, complimentary all day grazing table & packaged little snacks to have there or take away on your onward journey, including bottled water & individually wrapped hand napkins, to clean your hands afterwards! They have thought of everything.  More of a private members club, especially as hotel guests are only allowed on this 5th floor hotel, so real personal service.  After experiencing Hotel 41, you won’t want to stay in a big hotel chain again in London."
September 2021,London Trip with the youngest Son,"Took my smallest Son on his first trip to London and wanted to treat him to a nice hotel, we were not disappointed. Fabulous service from the outset with super friendly staff with a great attention to detail. Lovely decor and fabulous room. Great location for exploring London. I have stayed in some of the best hotels in the capital and I have to say that this is up there with the best. You know it must be good when you ask a 7 year old “What was your favourite part of the trip to London” and he replies “The lift and the bed”!!!!!"
September 2021,Birthday break in London.,"Always nice to return to this fantastic Hotel. An exclusive Residents only, with 30 Bedrooms and Suites with wonderful staff who provide an exclusive, personal service second to none. Try it you will not be disappointed. Great location close to Buckingham Palace."
September 2021,Tranquil escape,"Our second visit to Hotel 41. Can’t really add anything new to the positive comments already posted in pretty much every review on here for the hotel. All I’ll say is I very rarely visit the same anything twice as there are so many amazing places and things in the world to sample so why do the same thing twice. Hotel 41 has been the exception however, ever since staying 2 years ago we have longed to return, it really is a beautiful peaceful escape from the rest of the world, sitting on the rooftop bar or in the executive lounge is a beautiful thing and an amazing place to be. The staff treat you like royalty, the inclusions are great and I will make a third visit. "
September 2021,Felt very special,"I had read very good reviews of the hotel and i was definitely made to feel welcomed and accommodated, you can tell making the stay personal for the guest is very important and I felt if there was anything I would have needed, it would have been taken care of. The champagne during check in was lovely and so was the treats left in the room. I was looking just to relax and was able to do so in the lounge which was very plush, with the complimentary canapes and 'plunder the pantry' very nice. Location is great. (For me) the cost was high and so I was hoping the experience would be worth it and it was. Would recommend for anyone looking for a more traditional, luxury hotel stay."
September 2021,Birthday Celebrations at Hotel 41,Fantastic experience from the moment we arrived to celebrate husband's 60th birthday.  Amazing staff who couldn't do enough for us.  Champagne in the Executive Lounge a magic moment. I'd highly recommend this hotel and the location is great.
September 2021,Amazing,"Me and my fiancée had stayed at the hotel before and we were coming back for our anniversary. We were not disappointed. All the staff are amazing. When we arrived we saw a few members of staff that were at the hotel last time and what I found nice is that they actually remembered us as well which I found brilliant (well I hope for good reasons). On night we wanted to go out to a restaurant but it has been closed down so when speaking to reception they recommended a few restaurants for us to chose. They had booked the table for us and also mentioned to the restaurant that it was our anniversary. They also organised things for my anniversary like roses, champagne, a lovely cake and a lovely hand written card. The staff are so friendly and helpful. Anything you need they will get…"
October 2021,Birthday stay,Best hotel we have stayed at in the UK. Rooms were great as you would expect for a 5 star hotel. However it’s the service that sets the place apart from other 5 star hotels. Hotel 41 feels like you are a guest in someone’s home and all staff are exceptional. I must mention Steve who served us pre football and when we got back to the hotel. A great birthday treat in a great location
September 2021,Intimate wedding party,"My fiancée and I held an intimate wedding party at the hotel during the evening, and then ourselves and our guests stayed in the hotel overnight. The whole day was organised by the hotel manager (Lauren Hargrave) who could not be faulted, the service was nothing less than exemplary from her and her team, assisting with travel arrangements, flower delivery, transportation, dining and the overnight stay. The commitment, compassion, professionalism and service offered was unwavering throughout. The team made the day truly unforgettable and we will certainly be returning on each anniversary, to remind ourselves of a truly special day."
September 2021,memorable stay,"Stayed for 2 nights in the Monarch Suite which is a fine room overlooking the side of the palace. The hotel has a grand, yet intimate and welcoming feel. The staff here are on a different level. Everyone is really engaged and happy to spend the time to talk about the hotel and things to do in London. Complimentary champagne, scones, chocolates were welcome surprises. The location is outstanding. In 2 minutes we were walking past the front of Buckingham Palace and through to St James Park. Victoria rail stations are 5 minutes walk away. We ate at the BBar which is one of their restaurants next door. I had an amazing steak. We really enjoyed our stay and won't hesitate to go again."
September 2021,Exceptional stay,"Registration was effortless, having been offered a glass of champagne and nibbles, we admired the oldy worldly surroundings; fresh flowers, books, polished wood panels and soft lighting.  The black and white decorated bedroom included a king bed, writing desk, fire place, small sofa and coffee table, bathroom with bath and shower, wardrobe with plenty of draws and hangers, hairdryer, brolly, shoe horn, laundry bags, a safe dressing gowns and slippers. Coffee and tea facilities, along with sparking and still water. A celebratory cake, card and chocolates acknowledged a special anniversary celebration. The room was spotless and with a distinct sweet aroma in the air; the hotel 41 scent.  All we planned to do was relax and enjoy a change of scenery, switching off from our busy…"
September 2021,Another visit to The best hotel to stay at in London,Second visit to this wonderful oasis of bliss and luxury.  Far too long since my last stay courtesy of the Pandemic.  As before you feel like you have stepped into an exclusive club and indeed you have!  No standing at reception to check in like other hotel -  cases are taken at the main door and one of the many staff whisk you up to the lounge for you to recline relax and then comes the first dilemma.  You have to make a choice of either white or rose champagne.  On the house of course!  Andrew deserves special mention as he found and arranged a fantastic restaurant for our last night.  Since the pandemic a lot of restaurants close Sunday Monday -  something you just don’t think about when in the capital.  Any Restaurant 34 was terrific and thanks to Andrew!
September 2021,Superlative,"This was our 13th stay at 41 - and just wonderful.  Staff have been incredibly kind and helpful making our stay superb.   Room was stunning, food and beverages top notch, ambience to die for.  Wonderful position to explore London.   Cannot speak more highly and have already booked another three stays !"
September 2021,Exceptional birthday stay,"Wow!  Left speechless by the warmth and impeccable service we received.  From the time were contacted by Erica at the time of booking to the time we were greeted & shown around  by Nigesh, David, Dean, Steve, Alex and Marianne, everyone made us feel so welcome.  The afternoon tea, breakfast & free snacks in the exec lounge were exceptionally good. Plunder the pantry was such a lovely concept, not often seen in this country.  My requests for making the two birthday people’s birthdays special and  the halal food were totally taken on board.  Rooms are lovely as is attention to detail for the little things too. Book without any hesitation; you won’t be disappointed!"
September 2021,Regular visitor,"I make an annual trek to London to visit Hotel 41. This is a special place where your name is remembered. As a frequent guest I always get the same room, a junior suite. The service is impeccable. Drink with the general manager was a nice touch that was part of my rate."
September 2021,Without doubt the best hotel experience I have had in London.,All our expectations were surpassed at our stay in hotel 41. The service is exceptional and we were made to feel so welcome from the moment we arrived. We have been lucky enough to stay in a number of 5 star hotels all over the world and I am struggling to think of a better experience. They made my birthday weekend truly memorable and it is so nice to come somewhere this highly commended and not be disappointed. I could not recommend this hotel more wholeheartedly.
September 2021,Fantastic hotel with amazing service.,"Amazing Hotel and staff. Now I know how royalty feel! Beautiful interior and décor, very relaxing ambiance, but what makes this place are the staff. They simply cannot do enough for you. They always look happy to see you and know who you are throughout your stay, as you don't need to sign for anything or give your room number. Best check in experience you could ever hope for.   Take advantage of the inclusive food and snacks - the canapes were lovely. We will be back!"
September 2021,"Phenomenal hotel - great service, location and comfort - treat you like family",This hotel was fabulous from their service prior to arrival until we checked out.  Staff are all attentive and friendly.  Rooms are clean and comfortable.  We felt like part of the Hotel 41 family and everyone just seemed to know who we were.  Location is phenomenal with so much in walking distance.  We will definitely be back!
September 2021,Next Level....,"We stayed at 41 for our 10th anniversary and absolutely loved every single thing about it. Despite the well deserved reviews it still exceeded every expectation. It's the benchmark of how to find the balance between attention and intrusion, feeling comfortable and relaxed whilst being basically spoiled rotten . Thankyou so much for making a special occasion feel like it mattered to you too. Can't wait for next stay "
September 2021,An Fabulous Stay at Hotel 41,"We stayed two nights at Hotel 41. The checking in process was extremely painless. In fact we were taken to the beautiful lounge area & offered complimentary champagne whilst our bags were taken to our room. The staff are all incredibly polite, friendly & attentive. I am gluten intolerant & was told within 5 minutes of being there that the chef was aware & that it wouldn't be a problem catering for me at all. I get quite used to being treated as an awkward customer, so this made me feel comfortable immediately. The room was large, clean & the bed very comfortable indeed. We had complimentary chocolates, teas, Nespressso, filter coffee & bottle water. We also had a turn-down service where I was left a lovely pillow spray. I worked on my laptop during the day & the wifi was quick,…"
August 2021,One word - WOW!,"My partner and I stayed at 41 for just 1 night in August 2021 following an immensely enjoyable stay at the hotel’s sister property. Despite only staying for the night, our expectations of this beautiful hotel were far exceeded and this hotel is one that I am eager to visit again soon.  The hotel has a truly exclusive feel to it and this is something felt from the moment you enter the monochrome lobby and are swiftly escorted up to the Executive Lounge for a glass of champagne. The hotel is decorated throughout to the highest degree of elegance: monochrome accents and dark wood panelled walls adorn this gorgeous property and give it a truly chic vibe. We spent many hours in the Executive Lounge simply admiring the beauty of it.  Our hotel room was kindly upgraded at check-in to a…"
August 2021,Simply the best,"We visited 41 for a second time during our honeymoon and yet again it didn’t disappoint.   As soon as you arrive through the doors the beautiful signature scent hits you and you’re greeted warmly by the staff who are all absolutely amazing, so attentive and friendly.   The check in experience is second to none. You can stay in the beautiful executive lounge as long as you want whilst enjoying a glass of champagne (there are multiple options) of your choice. Just the best way to start a holiday.  We were shown to our beautiful suite which was absolutely stunning - a bathroom and seperate shower room, massive lounge area and honestly the most comfortable bed ever. The sheets are to die for- we were both exhausted after our wedding weekend and we slept so well! We were very…"
August 2021,"Amazing service, simply amazing!","We had read so many fantastic reviews on this hotel and wondered whether our stay would live up to our high expectations.  Well all I can say is it exceeded all our expectations and went straight to number one of our favourite hotels in London.    The staff are simply fantastic, professional and can't do enough for you.  Within a short time spent at the hotel we felt as if we had been coming to the hotel for years. The staff make quickly know your name and make you feel at home by being attentive with familiarity that is the right balance without you feeling uncomfortable or it being disingenuous.    The welcome glass of bubbly as you check in, the well appointed rooms and the sumptuous executive lounge did not disappoint.  Our highlight was the fantastic breakfast served each…"
August 2021,Our Favourite Hotel,"Our 3rd visit to Hotel 41 and another amazing experience.  The level of service is exemplery, staff are attentive and nothing is too much trouble. We were celebrating my birthday and my partner arranged a couple of experinces on offer through the hotel which were all fantastic. I cannot find any fault with this hotel and if you are looking for first class service in a luxurious setting then this is the place to stay."
August 2021,"If you can, book it!",You genuinely couldn’t ask for more. Staff were excellent and really nice. The food from both the evening trolley and breakfast was delicious. The rooms are fabulous and ridiculously comfy. Bathrooms were immaculate. The rooftop area was lovely when the weather allowed for it. Location wise it’s perfect!
August 2021,"Great location, amazing staff!","Great staff, clean hotel, felt very comfortable covid protocols were in place. Great late drinks. Location ideal for shopping, dining, sight seeing! Quiet in the morning and great late night drinks. Very accommodating and helpful staff."
July 2021,Pleasant stay but…,"Lovely location and  nice rooms which are quiet for london. Staff have some absolute stars there who will do anything to help you, but some not so helpful. I think perhaps they are resting on their laurels a little from the previous good feedback.  It is very relaxed and a club atmosphere, but there is literally one main Lounge, which is comfortable , but there are no other areas to relax in. This is the same area where other guests are booked in and checked out. This means you overhear other guests being booked in or out whilst you are trying to enjoy your meal or drink.  I also found the website a little misleading as they promise lots of included extra treats but they come with caveats. For example, canapés are complimentary but the impression from the website is that is with…"
July 2021,The best customer service ever!,"From the moment we checked in until the minute we left - the service we received at Hotel 41 was exceptional. It felt like every little detail had been thought about to make our stay feel as relaxed and special as possible. The hotel isn't big and the views from the rooms are nothing to write home about - but that  really doesn't matter as it is all about the experience. Every single member of staff was friendly, professional and couldn't do enough to make us feel welcome. Free champagne on arrival and free food and snacks everywhere. Certainly not the place to stay if you are on a diet :) But definitely the place to stay if you want to relax and indulge and receive the best ever customer service. Breakfast was incredible - delicious food, really punctual but not at all rushed…"
July 2021,Wonderful stay,This is without doubt one of the best hotels I've ever had the pleasure of staying in. It's small for a luxury London hotel with only 30 odd rooms and suites but that adds to its charm and allows the staff to offer a more personal service. Rooms are beautifully appointed and dressed in Hotel 41's signature monochrome. The executive lounge and rooftop bar are lovely places to have a drink and unwind with complimentary canapés. I came away fully recharged and on a mission to get me some monogrammed bed linen in my life!
July 2021,Luxury on London,"My second stay in this delightful hotel and it never disapoints. Great service from the staff, the rooms are beautifully decorated and very clean. The location is prime and only a short and comfortable walk to most tourist hot spots. This hotel and all the staff give you the personal service that makes you feel more than welcome. We can wait to return."
July 2021,Fabulous stay - nothing too much trouble,"What a wonderful hotel, I booked this for my 40th birthday after reading all the reviews on here and it didn't disappoint. All the staff especially Steve Jones who made our stay exceptionally relaxed. We stayed in a room just off the corridor from the Executive lounge so it was like a home from home. We will be back again!"
June 2021,Kyle's,"This hotel is exceptional, everything you could want has been thought off, the atmosphere is relaxing and friendly and the staff are a delight, nothing is too much trouble. Excellent attention to detail in the rooms which are beautiful. A real 5 star class act, super impressed."
June 2021,The best hotel I have ever stayed in!,"We celebrated my brother-in-law's 60th birthday at this fantastic hotel for a weekend in early June. I have stayed in many hotels but have never been treated to such  superb service as we have had from the staff at ""41"". The rooms were so comfortable, sporting the most comfortable bed we have ever slept on, with all the additions of tea and coffee facilities etc etc. The location of the hotel is within walking distance of  London Victoria BR Station and almost opposite Buckingham Palace grounds. The interior decor of the hotel is second to none. A warren of corridors regaled in interesting artworks lead you to the jewel of a reception area. Something of a 'gentlemens club' feel to the surroundings enhanced our experience to another level. We so much enjoyed the attention we were…"
June 2021,Best hotel in London,"My partner took me here for my birthday and we had the most incredible time. Nothing was too much for the staff, they were so attentive and friendly, the evening canapes were delicious and the breakfast was perfect. My partner proposed in the evening, and the staff made it so special (especially Andrew and Adele) and a completely unforgettable experience. I cannot wait to come back with our families. We could never stay anywhere else in London after having stayed here."
June 2021,Hotel 41,"This hotel is fabulous and is a secret that definitely should be shared! We had a wonderful stay and the staff, who were absolutely amazing, made us both feel very special.  We would definitely love to come and stay again."
May 2021,Amazing!,"Took my girlfriend for her birthday. We loved it! Fantastic room, fantastic service, the staff couldn’t do enough.  Complimentary food was such a nice touch and the breakfast was amazing! Can’t thank the staff enough!     I would recommend for anyone!"
August 2021,Amazing return visit!,"This is our second visit to Hotel 41 and we will return! Nothing is too much trouble for the staff, the rooms are amazing - in the words of my 9 year old daughter - ""they feel like family"". We booked the junior suite and were upgraded to the executive suite - a lovely gesture. From the minute you arrive you feel relaxed. A drink on the rooftop bar is a must.  Hotel 41 is an experience like no other hotel experience - a truly unique and special stay!  We can't wait to our next stay!"
August 2021,Another great stay at No 41,"Stayed one night for our Wedding Anniversary and had another great visit. The staff are so friendly and nothing is too much trouble.A nice champagne welcome in the lounge/reception area, a beautiful room. The rooms are very comfortable with all you need at hand. The position of Hotel 41 is excellent, a little out of the West End and close to restaurants in all directions and tourist attractions if you need them. A late night bar for when you return from an evening out and breakfast until 11, perfect. We will definitely return, for longer next time however. you must go to No 41!"
August 2021,Best hotel staff we’ve ever met,"A stunning hotel . The staff and management were absolutely fantastic. Wish we hadn’t only booked one night! Will definitely be back for a longer stay. Stayed in the junior suite but sure all the rooms are fantastic. All staff members we encountered were really helpful, friendly and HAPPY!! Many thanks to everyone for making our stay so great"
July 2021,Perfection,"This is a fantastic hotel with amazing staff; I'm so pleased we found it! It's not only dog-friendly but our special chap was treated as well as any guest and really didn't want to leave! The rooms are lovely; clean, beautifully-decorated and extremely comfortable and the location and staff are unbeatable. We can't wait to return."
August 2021,Absolutely fantastic hotel,"Really not much to say about hotel 41 but 'fantastic'. On arrival we were welcomed at the front door and guided to the 5th floor for check-in. Checking in is completely different from any other hotel we have visited, we were sat in the lounge area and given a glass of champagne. The lounge area is beautifully decorated, clean and probably the freshest smelling room ever. Once checked in we went to our foom, our sons had a standard room with twin bed, again very clean and plenty of room for them. Our room on the other hand a split lever suit, is spacious, well lit and honest stunningly decorated. Honestly I can't use the words beautiful, gorgeous, wow and impressive enough when writing. During our stay the staff are probably the best I've ever had the opportunity to meet in all…"
August 2021,A hotel that undoubtedly goes above and beyond,I booked hotel41 for my partners 30th birthday. Hotel41 made it such a special experience. Thanks to all their charming staff for the best stay. I would not hesitate to recommend a stay to anyone looking for something that little bit special.
August 2021,"PURE HEAVEN  - TRULY 1st CLASS and 6 star, not 5.","Oh wow. Where to start. The welcome, so lovely...like coming home, but with a concierge at your front door! All of the staff were extremely friendly and professional in equal measure. They all wear white cotton gloves. As ALL staff were so wonderful, I am reluctant to single anyone out, yet Andrew (from Greenock) was particularly warm & attentive. A great check in experience with a rose champagne. It almost felt like an honour to hand over my credit card. The room was a reasonable size and excellent. Turn down service with attention to detail, such as towel/toiletry needs, chocs on pillow. The breakfast was divine. Try everything, it is all 1st class. Lots of afternoon and early evening treats, nibbles & small bites. On our 2nd night we didn't even go out for dinner, it was that…"
August 2021,A hidden gem in the heart of Victoria,"Having read all the impressive reviews of this Hotel, I was eager to see if it would live up to my very high expectations! We were greeted downstairs by a lovely girl on reception before being whisked upstairs to the executive lounge to check in. Steve (quite a character with a great sense of humour) supplied the very welcome champagne and canapés while we checked in. Our room was available immediately (a welcome surprise). Loved the gorgeous handmade chocolates which awaited us in the room with a handwritten note from the Manager welcoming us. It's these touches that I think elevate the Carnation Group above other 5 star Hotels. The room was gorgeous, the bed so comfy, the toiletries wonderful.  Our absolute favourite part of our stay has to be the afternoon we spent up on the…"
August 2021,"Chic, Comfortable & Friendly","We enjoyed our stay at this chic and comfortable hotel. It is noteworthy how especially kind, helpful and friendly all the staff were throughout our stay, which made for a very restorative time. We appreciated the welcome glass of champagne, delightful breakfast and the late checkout."
August 2021,A little gem in the city,"Fantastic hotel, the staff were friendly, helpful and attentive making us feel very welcome. A drink on arrival whilst checking in was a great touch, and evening drinks on the rooftop in the sunshine was an added bonus. Will definitely be returning soon."
June 2021,Top class hotel with superb staff,"A superb stay. The location of the hotel is perfect. The team are first class and make you feel very special, as if you are the only guests staying. The food is excellent and breakfast in particular is fantastic. We enjoyed raiding the pantry and having the canapés with drinks in the evening. A truly memorable trip to London."
July 2021,Best hotel I’ve stayed in !,"The decor is beautiful, bedroom comfortable and the lounge is superb. Very luxurious but cosy. Much time was spent enjoying drinks on the rooftop terrace ! On arrival we were greeted with a complimentary glass of champagne and thereafter there is a wealth of complimentary treats including chocolates, ice cream, scones served with jam and cream, evening canapés and sweet and savoury treats from the  “ plunder the pantry “ trolley from 8pm. Perhaps the best thing of all about the hotel is it’s wonderful staff. Everyone was so friendly , always addressing you by name and they were super efficient. Thank you all for making our stay so special."
June 2021,Exceptional staff - a very luxurious boutique stay.,"This was booked as a long post-lockdown treat, and, in line with all expectations ( in fact surpassing them considerably) we found the hotel, and staff to be truly exceptional.  First class attentive service, from arrival to departure.  We were always made to feel special, and this was a very personal and gracious guest experience- absolut5ideal for special and romantic occasions.  The location is superb for touring London, the west end and shows. In view of Buckingham Palace,  and minutes from Victoria Station. Food was superb, breakfast included and this was bespoke, plentiful and exceptional every day. In the evenings drinks are served with canapés in a small private club room. This is a very intimate and small boutique experience,  far removed from a Marriott or Hilton - do…"
July 2021,Perfect stay at Hotel 41,"Thank you so much for a fabulous overnight stay Hotel 41 for my mums 60th birthday! The little touches made our experience so memorable - the complimentary champagne and canapés, the birthday cake and chocolates in our room on arrival and the downturn in the evening to make our room really relaxing. My Mum said it was the best night sleep she has had in ages as the bed was so comfy and the room was so quiet! The staff couldn’t do enough to help us, and their friendly approach made us feel so welcome! Thank you - we will be back and we would highly recommend!"
June 2021,Hotel 41 another gem from Red Carnation,The staff were excellent and the service was of the highest quality. The attention to detail was superb. Location was perfect only short walk to the palace. Rooms were luxurious and spacious and the lounge was fabulous for a quiet drink and some canapés Would highly recommend this hotel as excellent value for money as having stayed in pricier hotels in London with less than half the service.This is the third Red Carnation hotel have stayed in and all have been excellent value and quality.
July 2021,Still Brill,"Our 5th stay at Hotel 41 - which probably tells you all you need to know - and it continues to remain our favourite hotel for the reasons that virtually all other reviews have listed. It's too hot for me to rehash all of these so whilst I go off and have a Solero, why don't you do yourself a favour and book it. Promise you wont regret it."
June 2021,Sanctuary in the heart of London,"We’ve just spent three nights thoroughly enjoying the hospitality at Hotel 41. We stayed in one of the Executive King Suites, room 4114.  The hotel has the feel of an old fashioned private members club. The entrance is low-key almost like a speakeasy, nestled alongside the grander entrance to the Rubens.  We stayed during the summer heatwave, and the first thing we noticed on arriving was the chilled air welcoming us in, along with the signature scent that runs through all the public areas.  The room was great, compact but with everything we needed including a seating area and not one but two of the very best showers I’ve had in a hotel room. We had a lovely piece of cake in the room on arrival too which was a lovely touch.  There is a nice roof terrace offering very good…"
June 2021,"Our new favourite London hotel - super location, exceptional service and nothing is too much trouble","We stayed at Hotel 41 for a couple of nights for our 25th wedding anniversary and from the moment we were offered a complimentary glass of champagne from the lovely Steve Jones in the executive lounge while we were checking in, I knew we were going to have a great stay. Lauren on reception was super friendly and helpful, assisting us with alterations to dinner reservations and the like.  The executive lounge is just beautiful... tall mahogony panelling & bookcases, a glass ceiling, stunning chandeliers and a complimentary array of snacks, ice-cream, canapes, cheese & more at various times throughout the day. As mentioned by previous reviewers, the executive lounge does have the reception desk, comp pantry,  bar, and tables where you have drinks, breakfast or meals but it's…"
June 2021,A Marvellous Experience,"We recently stayed at Hotel 41 for the first time and I can say without hesitation - we can’t wait to return!  It’s a beautiful hotel in an excellent location and overall, a marvellous experience - Thank you to the efficient, attentive and friendly staff that make it this way."
July 2021,Stay at Hotel 41 18th July 2021,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for the first time recently. It absolutely lives up to its reviews. You could select the attention to detail in the hotel, the exquisite rooms etc.   You may find equally stunning hotels elsewhere. What sets Hotel 41 apart from other places is simply the people that work there. The whole team is exceptional in their service, but it isn't obsequious.  They are just so friendly, and have evident pride in the place.   We'll certainly be back, as no doubt will others time and again. A hotel like this is difficult to replicate. It just works!"
April 2021,"An amazing hotel, with amazing staff - Surprise Engagement","Where do I start!  I planned to stay at Hotel 41 for a surprise proposal to my partner of three years.  Firstly, I have to say a very big thank you to all the staff for making our stay extra special. An extra big thank you to the General Manager, Mr Hendry, who made it his mission to ensure everything went like clockwork!  When we arrived at Paddington Station, there was a luxury Range Rover waiting for us with chilled bottled water, which was much needed due to the sunny weather.  When we pulled up to Hotel 41, two members of staff welcomed us opening the car doors and taking our luggage. We were then taken inside for check-in. You are then escorted up the elevator to the top floor where you are again escorted by a member of staff to the hotel’s own executive lounge. In the…"
May 2021,Beautiful hotel ran by an exceptional team,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for my mum’s birthday and had an amazing experience.  As you walk into Hotel 41 you are instantly greeted by the wonderful scent created specially for the hotel. It certainly adds a touch of luxury to the atmosphere and both my mum and I really loved it. The hotel itself has beautiful dark academia decor that is both unique and welcoming. The Executive Lounge in particular was striking and to be honest, we didn’t want to leave!   While checking in, we were given a choice of champagne and nibbles. The check in process was smooth and efficient and then afterwards shown to our room. The room itself was spacious, very clean and comfortable. We really appreciated the wonderful selection of teas and coffees that were made available in the room as well. I put in a…"
June 2021,A Much-Anticipated Return That Didn't Disappint,"Having first visited Hotel 41 last summer, my partner and I were so impressed we decided to return for my 40th later that year. The continued lockdowns scuppered these original plans, but the Hotel were superb about helping us rearrange, and keeping in contact with us as regulations changed.  We finally managed to get the booking sorted for this weekend, and it was frankly superb. We just wanted a nice, relaxing weekend, and the service and quality provided made sure that happened.  Our room was delightful, the breakfasts were outstanding and the afternoon tea was sublime - I couldn't recommend the Hotel enough to anyone.  I'd like to say thanks to Andrew, Adele, Dean, Erica, Lauren and Orsi (as well as all the other guys we didn't get a chance to chat with) for being so…"
June 2021,Delightful. ,"We were visiting London to buy our wedding rings and wanted somewhere special to stay. Hotel 41 is more than special. It is wonderful.  A unique place and a superb team make for a delightful combination. We enjoyed every minute.   Part of the uniqueness of Hotel 41 is the Executive Lounge which provides a hub in which to relax. Plunder the Pantry is a great feature, but the complimentary canapés are a lovely touch at cocktail time.  One of our favourite features though is Whatever Whenever. Not only a brilliant idea, but it sums up on two words the approach to delivering great service. "
June 2021,Brilliant Experience ,"There is not a grand palatial entrance to this hotel, but the staff treat you like royalty.  The whole experience of staying in Hotel 41 is a pleasure. The complimentary food and welcome glass of champagne make you feel very special.  The decor is muted elegance. The roof terrace is functional, but once again,the friendly staff make all the difference.  I would definitely return!  "
May 2021,It really doesn’t get better than Hotel 41,"Where do I start?  My experience at Hotel 41 was everything I could have hoped for and more.  It is such an intimate venue on one floor with only 28 rooms.  From the moment you arrive, everyone on staff greets you by name and you feel you have stepped into a club that makes you feel at home and like family.    They welcome you at the lounge which was my home away from home for 4 days.   I was then escorted to my wonderful room which was impeccable.  Nothing is overlooked.  The decor is all black and white from the carpets to the linens to the lovely artwork through the hotel.    While the room was amazing, it’s the customer service that will really make you not want to leave.  From Lauren, David, Steve, Andrew, etc.  They offer world class service that I challenge you to find…"
May 2021,Fabulous hotel with exceptional staff,"You arrive at the discreet entrance where a scarlet clad gentleman welcomes you into the gleaming and luxurious foyer, and here your visit to this elegant - but not stuffy or pretentious - hotel begins.  In the executive lounge on the fifth floor with its beautiful chandeliers and shelves of antique books you are invited to enjoy a glass of champagne whilst you check in, maybe enjoying some canapes.  How very civilised, and exemplifies the way the hotel is run, with staff ever willing to help ""whatever, whenever"".    Do book a picnic in the park.  I felt like a princess for the day 👑"
July 2021,London Calling part 3,"This is our third visit to London, and  our second stay at Hotel 41, it’s a superb hotel where the decor and service are spot on. Staff are  attentive to every detail of your stay, making us  feel welcomed at every point.  The area is a great location for many attractions on foot or around the corner there is the tube to whisk you off to your destination.  If you decide to visit check out the “Plunder the Pantry”, not going to tell you anymore about that 👨‍🍳😊!!!.  It’s simply a great hotel, with fab staff, and those little extras that separate it from other hotels I have stayed in.  Get booking 😊"
July 2021,Not bad.. just awesome!👍,"From the friendly welcome at the lobby, to the final goodbye, everything was excellent 🌟. The key to any successful business are its people/staff. #41 has definitely nailed that 1, i.e. all the staff were attentive without being intrusive. The room was very comfortable, the food & other goodies, just yummtastic!  Would we return ( like many have) .Oh Yes👍👍"
July 2021,Incredible! The staff are exceptional. Still on cloud 9 from our stay.,Not sure where to begin....but from beginning to end our stay was amazing. The staff are happy to help with your every wish and stay relaxed and friendly to make you feel so welcome. The food and free flowing champagne....Plunge the Pantry....Excellent Margarita....Ice creams!! and treats are all lovely touches. Comfy bed. Truly the best time and its location as the Queen as your neighbour...what more can i say!... but THANK YOU x
July 2021,birthday trip,"first time at this lovely hotel, and it defiantly wont be the last. from the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty, the staff were so attentive and so very friendly. the hotel was so clean and fresh. i would highly recommend a stay there as its a great location. My son has already booked a night there on our return. I have to add that the bed was the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in. Thank you all for making my birthday very special. Thank you as well for leaving a little cake in our room, was very yummy although could not eat it all."
July 2021,Like having a home in central London,"A lovely hidden gem with great service, fabulous location and an array of unexpected delights such as a free glass of champagne on arrival, chocolates in your room each evening with turn down and a plunder pantry for snacks. The rooms are a modest size but with very comfortable beds. Above all the welcome and service is exceptional. Relaxed luxury."
July 2021,Romantic 50th for my Husband,"Where can I begin, we went for my husbands 50th, they organised everything beautifully that I had organised, from the picnic, to the romantic turn down. Every member of the team are friendly and happy to help and willing to go the extra mile, even offering a later check out to help relax. The hotel is beautifully kept and all the small touches makes it a pleasure to stay. Thank you!"
July 2021,Fabulous service and fantastic location- a real gem!,Absolutely loved our stay at Hotel 41. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and there were lovely touches like welcome champagne on arrival and chocolates in the room. We enjoyed cocktails on the roof and made full use of Plunder the Pantry. Room was sparkling clean and the bed was super comfy. We will be back!
July 2021,Our home from home!,"We have been fortunate to stay at Hotel 41 a few times and we wouldn’t want to stay anywhere else in London.  It has the comfort of “home”  whilst maintaining the luxury feel, from the beautiful scent around the corridors; the polished interior in the lounge and excellent food quality. The main positive is the staff; nothing is too much trouble and you are made to feel welcome. It’s lovely that they know your name and you are never asked for your room number! We have used the valet service, which is great, park outside and they park and deliver your car for you. It was around £55 per 24 hours.  The rooms are lovely and are high end comfort, which is what you need when walking around London all day. Our room had remote control blinds, a deep bath/shower, fridge, ironing board and…"
May 2021,Wonderful and much loved - The best!,"We stayed for 1 night with 2 friends to celebrate my husbands 65th Birthday . From the Champagne check in to the wonderful breakfast the next morning . The experience was fab! The staff are excellent , to single out by name would not be fair. Plundering the Pantry , having snacks on the roof terrace and sleeping in the most comfortable bed ever all added to a great time. We will definitely be returning …it may seem extravagant but hey it’s worth it👍"
June 2021,Perfection,"Wonderful hotel! The best! So glad to be back!   A fabulous stay at the wonderful Hotel 41 - absolutely deserving of the number 1 spot out of all the many hotels across London. Walking into the lobby you walk into another world of luxurious calm where nothing is too much trouble.  The rooms are all in a simple but luxurious black & white theme. The king executive rooms are large. I prefer the rooms looking out on the Royal Mews - Buckingham Palace Road. There is generous complimentary fizz on arrival, a complimentary ‘Plunder the Pantry’ for supper from 8pm and breakfast is extensive delicious, there are complimentary canapés and toasties  from 6pm. You cannot be hungry here!   Highly recommended and much loved Thank you Hotel 41!"
June 2021,2nd stay just as good as the 1st,By far the best hotel we have ever stayed in up town (probably the world!). Absolutely faultless from start to finish. Made to feel so welcome by all of the marvellous staff and nothing was too much trouble. Planning our next return already. Thank you Hotel 41 for making my husband's 50th birthday treat so special. 
April 2021,Amazing,"Hotel 41 really is an outstanding hotel, this is our 2nd stay. The service they provide is fantastic and we enjoyed our visit as much as our last. There is now the great addition of the rooftop terrace, which we enjoyed in the fabulous weather. We have been fortunate to stay in some great hotels - Hotel 41  however really does top the list, a real hidden gem."
May 2021,A Jewel in Buckingham Palace Road,Me and my fiancé stayed at this hotel at the end of may. We had the most amazing time. The staff where incredible and so helpful. The hotel and room where amazing. Also the experiences the hotel offer and the restaurants are super. Would recommend to anybody   Thank you to all the staff
August 2021,Small is Beautiful,"If your looking for a large brash hotel, then Hotel 41 isn't for you. This is a small Hotel that occupies the 5th floor only and only has a couple of dozen rooms. It's is an intimate experience where you're made to feel at home by the hugely attentive staff. This is very much a 5 Star Hotel. The only downside to my stay and I'm clutching at straws here was the location was taxi ride away from most of the centrally based bookings we had made but that's arguably not their issue. We also chose a Split Level Suite which had a small downstairs living area which we didn't use but again, that was possibly a poor choice on my behalf. I would highly recommend this Hotel and it is highly likely we will return!"
August 2021,"Checked in as a guest,left as a friend","What can I say, just exquisite from start to finish. Welcome champagne on arrival before going to a stunning room. Beautiful touches, delightful executive lounge with very tasty canapés. Beautiful perfume throughout, found the whole stay so relaxing. Well done to Lauren the manager but a special thanks to Dean for remembering my name when pouring me a coffee at breakfast and to the lovely lady on checking out that sorted me out with Huggi bear. The whole team are a credit. I was overwhelmed when I left with the kindness I had experienced. Just an amazing find indeed. Don’t change a thing."
August 2021,An experience to say the least,"This hotel is a little bit odd. Sort of surreal and probably not for everyone. But I did love it!  Travelled here with two friends and my husband and had a wonderful time.  You have the whole of London on your doorstep but somehow know the best service you are going to get is in this little executive lounge.   The prices are admittedly a little ridiculous for me (£10 for a 330ml bottle of mass produced meantime beer from Asahi….!!!!!!!) £6 for a bottle of fever tree tonic to go with your £24 gin (I cry)  This came very very close to marking it down BUT….despite my complaining, the gin and tonic tasted better than they usually do, which harks back to it being about the circumstances that you enjoy your drinks!!  HUGE hats off for Dean & Steve who gave us fantastic service all…"
July 2021,10* Jewel in London’s crown ❤️,"An absolute jewel of a hotel, the service was something we had never experienced from start to finish this was a lifetime experience. Nothing to fault only to sing the praise of an amazing hotel. 10/10 on cleanliness, comfort and service can not recommend more."
July 2021,Like returning to see old friends,"We have been staying at Hotel 41 for nearly 10 years and it is out hotel of choice in London. This was out first stay since the pandemic and a long overdue rearrangement from previous cancelled trips. It was like seeing old friends, you felt everyone was pleased to see you and interested in how you had been through the madness of the last 18 months. We stayed 3 nights, had a lovely room and enjoyed every moment of our stay, thank you Lauren & the team. We chatted & laughed with every member of the team and enjoyed the roof terrace, the curry room, the bar at the Rubens and the Bbar, not to mention the executive lounge and all the wonderful staff, special thanks to Steve who has the same sense of humour as my husband. Look forward to the next visit."
August 2021,Best hotel experience ever!!!,"This was, by far, the best stay in a hotel we have ever had in the world.  Impeccable service from everyone, including housekeeping staff, from the moment you step though the door. These guys have bought into a culture ""we do everything 100% right first time, without fail, no exceptions"". You could spend thousands more in some London legacy hotels and never experience this level of hospitality.  We will certainly return and will highly recommend 41."
August 2021,Best staff in hospitality,"Without question the most attentive and conscientious staff I've encountered.  We've stayed on a couple of occasions and the wife and I always remark on how wonderful they are. The hotel itself is nice, and in a wonderful location for much of the city.  Highly recommend a stay"
August 2021,Exceptional!,"From the second we stepped foot inside, until the moment we checked out (and a little bit after that as my husband has left our car keys in the safe so had to go back into the hotel) the service was impeccable. The hotel itself is stunning and in an ideal location but, make no mistake, it’s the staff that make this such a wonderful place to stay.  We were given champagne and snacks on arrival and shown to our beautiful room. We had been told about the snack bar with crisps, chocolate and and ice creams to choose throughout the day. There were also other snack options available at different times of the day (plunder the pantry was most welcome after our theatre trip). There is a lovely roof terrace to visit, if the weather permits.  The room had a nespresso machine, Sky TV and…"
August 2021,A very special gem of a hotel,"This is quite simply the best hotel I've ever stayed in. Elegant and grand yet understated at the same time. The key to what is great about this hotel is the attention to detail in every aspect of your stay and that is down to the fantastic staff who cannot do enough for you. They make you feel at home whilst serving up many of the complimentary treats that are on offer, from champagne, to canapés, ice-cream and lovely little gifts left in the room. And the breakfasts are to die for, I particularly recommend the smoked salmon and caviar omelette. The rooftop terrace offers fantastic views across the Buckingham palace mews, and feels almost Mary Poppins-esq sitting amongst the chimney pots!  The executive lounge is a calm and relaxing environment, where you could easily feel like…"
July 2021,Little luxurious gem,"Stayed pre pandemic and loved it and promised ourselves our first trip away when restrictions eased would be to return to this little luxurious gem - Hotel41. Our second visit did not disappoint,  treating ourselves to the conservatory master suite- WOW it was fabulous.  The hotel is small but perfectly formed, lots of classic black and white decor, with gentleman’s club grandeur in the executive lounge. The surroundings are amazing but it’s the staff that make this hotel exceptional- each person is dedicated to making your stay a truly wonderful experience. We can not fault it. It’s in a superb location for everything London has to offer. We’ll definitely be back and highly recommend."
May 2021,"Fantastic service, akin to being treated like the Royalty down the road.","Amazing service, second to none.  Check in and check out are not rushed, allowing you to utilise the comfortable executive lounge.  The complimentary snacks bar and ice cream freezer were fantastic additions and breakfast was delicious, with a couple of options you wouldn't see everywhere.  Nice rooftop bar area too.  The only slight improvement I would make is, although the blinds and curtains are clearly enough for blackout purposes, just ensuring the blinds and curtains could close to minimise the amount of light coming into the room."
May 2021,A Little Hidden Gem! ,"I have just returned from a short weekend away with my 9 year old son in London. This was my son's first time visiting the capital, so I wanted to make it a little special.  Staying at Hotel 41 definitely contributed to making it a lovely weekend which we both enjoyed immensely. If you are looking for small intimate hotel with excellent attention to detail and service in general, I would definitely recommend 41. Both my son and I felt very looked after without any of the pretentiousness you can get in some 5 star hotels. My son is autistic so the calm and quiet of the hotel was a good contrast to the bustle of the city.  The staff are very friendly,  especially Andrew who will go above and beyond  to help, he is an absolute asset to the hotel! "
April 2021,Impeccable!,"How amazing to have had the most wonderful stay in London at Hotel 41.   From the initial booking to leaving everything was taken care of with such professionalism. The team at Hotel 41 are some of the most attentive and kind individuals of their profession.    The food was delicious from breakfast to lunch, canapés to dinner. With a vast arrange of drinks on offer along with a well thought out menu for food. My dietary restrictions were no trouble and I was very well catered for.   The staff were superb but a special mention to Steve, Erica, Svete, Lauren and Andrew. You along with the rest of Hotel 41 took such care of us and were so attentive. You really made our stay all the more enjoyable.  It’s not just the special touches that Hotel 41 provide (I won’t spoil it by telling…"
May 2021,Amazing,"What an amazing experience we had. Staff went above and beyond to make our stay unforgettable. The lounge was stunning, beautiful design. Perfect location. Very good breakfast and great cocktails. The room had superb facilities. We definitely will be back."
May 2021,Luxury hotel with great service,A hidden Jem in London on the 5th floor. Greeted with champagne as I checked in. The staff and attention to detail is exceptional. Breakfast was first class with a range of delicious options. Looking forward to the next trip.
May 2021,"Fantastic stay, outstanding service!!","The reviews aren’t wrong, the service at Hotel 41 is outstanding. I stay in lots of very nice hotels, all over the world and very rarely go out of my way to write a review. I couldn’t help myself with Hotel 41!  My wife and I checked in on Thursday and stayed until Sunday without the kids for a romantic, relaxing break. The first since lockdown 3.0    Upon check in we were helped up to the executive lounge, you are greeted with a glass of fiz.   The staff make this hotel so special, Andrew did a great job of welcoming us and remembered us from the first time we visited 18 months ago, so did all the other staff, checking you in, showing you to your room and making you feel comfortable. The ‘whenever/whatever’ button in your room does exactly what it says..... if you need…"
May 2021,Just Heaven !!,"First weekend after hotels re-opened following easing of lockdown and we we were blessed to enjoy a 2 night weekend stay at Hotel 41. It is just ""Heaven"". No stress. Just calm and serenity throughout our stay, and the best staff ever. Somehow amongst an incredibly warm, efficient and genuinely caring team of wonderful people , ""Andrew"" manages somehow to distinguish himself as just exceptional.  From the moment you arrive and have a glass of complimentary  champagne pressed into you hand, to the moment you (sadly) leave, the attention to detail is just perfect throughout.  We  especially love Breakfast served in the room which is just brilliant. Food great and staff take so much care to set up the table and to make sure everything is perfect.  Nothing is too much trouble for…"
May 2021,Wonderful in every way,"Every single member of staff went out of their way to make our night wonderful. The hotel is stunning, It is by far my most favourite place and we have already booked for July. The suite we were lucky enough to stay in was tasteful and immaculate with lovely touches like candles and petals for turndown and also a beautiful handwritten card with a cake for our anniversary. Just Perfect.  Thank you in every way x"
May 2021,Couldn’t recommend more,We had a night stay here with friends and it was flawless from start to finish. The staff are the best we’ve come across at any hotel and nothing is too much. The selection of snacks and extra touches were exceptional and we will definitely come back as soon as we can. The standards are so high and the staff are so professional whilst being friendly and paying so much attention to detail. Thank you to everyone for making our stay so special. If I could give you more than 5 stars I would
April 2021,An Amazing Experience,"We had the pleasure of staying at this beautiful boutique hotel to celebrate our wedding.  From the very first contact from booking and arriving at the hotel, everything was seamless and no trouble.  Upon entering the hotel the smell was divine, we were greeted at the lift by the receptionist and invited to check in with a customary glass of rose champagne.    Now that’s how you do check in !!  Our room was amazing fully appointed with the best smelling Floris toiletries.  This hotel is full of little surprises and extras.  Canapés and croque monsieurs with drinks in the evening.  The ever present and fully stocked plunder the pantry which was always different.    Our rate included an afternoon tea and what an experience that was, they have the most amazing pastry chef.   …"
December 2020,Best hotel in London,"This hotel is absolutely phenomenal - I cannot fault it at all. The customer service is exemplary. I have stayed here four times now and I will definitely be returning next year. Each time I go they put little touches in the room welcoming me back, they even gave us a room upgrade.  Dean was absolutely fantastic. The staff are so attentive and it made my stay very memorable.  Thank you again hotel 41, see you all soon."
December 2020,An absolutely gem of a hotel,"We stayed for only one night for my 50th birthday and wow this hotel is wonderful in so many ways. The staff really make this hotel a cut above the rest. They are extremely attentive, they make you feel like you are their most special guest and remember details about what you said the day before, ask after how your day was and are genuinely interested in ensuring you are having a great stay. The hotel itself is superb, love the black and white theme and the smell from their own room spray is delightful throughout. All the little touches that they offer like the complimentary glass of champagne on arrival to the nibbles constantly available and the little box of chocolates in the room are lovely. The bed was extra comfy too! Special mention to David who served us breakfast, what…"
September 2020,Costly but lovely,Really enjoyed my stay there. Very beautiful and welcoming stay. The room was very big and beds were nicely arranged . My whole family enjoyed the stay. But the price is too much.it should be reduced .
December 2019,Charming Hotel in Westminster,"I traveled here pre-Covid but even if I were to go back, I would stay here as the staff were warm and very helpful and the rooms were immaculate. The hotel interior is very impressive and the rooms are modern and well-designed, retaining some period-like features that seemed original to the property.  There was an issue with my bathroom in the morning of check-out day, however, the staff were quick on their feet and allowed me to use a bathroom of an alternative room (I did not want to move rooms as I liked the room I was assigned to).   Their amenities were also great - the slippers were so fluffy with his and hers pouches to match.   I fell in love with their parlor-like space where breakfast was served, along with cocktails in the evenings. The cocktails were good and…"
November 2020,5 stars and more,"This is the second visit I have had to this fabulous hotel. Everything about the hotel is magnificent,  from the welcome at the door to the goodbye when you leave making you feel that you are the most cherished guests.  Every  member of staff extols the same exemplary level of courtesy and service at every opportunity. The Executive lounge is exquisite, intimate  and comfortable.   Our room,  an Executive King was spectacular, providing us with everything that we needed for our stay and much more including a scrumptious, chocolate celebration cake.  Hotel 41 is a jewel, in an excellent location,  to be discovered in London."
May 2021,"Exclusive, unpretentious boutique excellence","The staff are simply incredible at this beautiful, discreet hotel in the heart of London. The rooms are perfectly appointed and generously equipped. A great choice of food and drink, including a wonderful breakfast. Highly recommended for anybody looking for some unpretentious, exclusive boutique excellence....and did I mention how great the staff are!"
December 2020,Truly the Most Magnificent Hotel in London,"I would highly recommend Hotel 41 (there is no other hotel like this one).  Where do I begin - The staff are the most customer focused, attentive individuals I have ever met - they will go over and beyond to ensure you have the best experience ever.  They will ensure your every need is met and they truly are the most genuine and caring individuals you will meet.  The check in process is amazing - always a special treat.    The rooms are fabulous and have an individual signature touch.  The cocktails and drinks are served with a smile and  always an interesting conversation.  The breakfast is delicious and every need is met.  Pancakes are truly amazing.  The Terrace is gorgeous where you must have a cocktail or two and soak up the atmosphere.  Genuinely my second home and my…"
April 2021,fantastic hotel,"for business reasons they booked me in this hotel, very comfortable room and nothing is missing, kind staff, impeccable room service. I thank the management for helping me solve a small personal problem."
February 2020,5 star boutique hotel,"Hotel has 30 room luxury boutique & a member of red carnation group. Flawless hospitality & free champagne on arrival, snacks around the clock , all rooms have free wifi & ipod docks, private club & attentive service."
October 2020,"Elegant, cosy and warm","We were lucky enough to have chosen Hotel 41 for our wedding anniversary in October.  I had stayed in Red Carnation Hotels before in South Africa so was familiar with their exceptional customer service and warm welcome.  We were not disappointed.  From the moment we arrived it was as if we were their most important guests, though I know everyone had that experience.   Our room was stunning and had everything you could possible need including some fresh milk in the fridge which we had requested prior to arrival and a little chocolate anniversary cake.  The executive lounge is very cosy and comfortable with a wonderful fire and book lined walls.  If you like a small and intimate hotel in a wonderful location then look no further than Hotel 41.  We also ate at bbar restaurant (only…"
November 2020,5 stars hotel with a royal vibe,Pros  - Excellent service  - Super comfortable room  - Amazing Royal vibe  - Beautiful building inside and outside   - Lots of complimentary treats including ice cream and nuts.   - Excellent Wi-Fi   - Excellent breakfast  Cons  - Restaurant menu could have more options  - Missing a jacuzzi in the room 😊😊
November 2020,Belmond Pullman trip,"We stayed here because it was a short walk to Victoria station for our Belmond British Pullman train trip to Bath. The hotel was lovely, rooms fantastic, comfy beds, roaring fireplace. We loved the cosy lounge/reception area. The staff were all exceptionally friendly and genuine with it. They thought of every little detail there, I cannot think of one negative. It was the best shower ever and I loved their ‘raid the pantry’ idea, for late snacks. Brilliant! "
October 2020,Fabulous birthday stay,"Hotel 41 is the most wonderful 5 star hotel. Everything is sheer class, rooms,atmosphere, food and above all staff. During a 3 night break for my wife’s birthday we could not have been treat better, looked after better or felt more special. From start to end everything was perfect!"
November 2020,Quick staycation in London.,"Quick staycation in London!  My partner and I stayed at hotel 41 for the weekend. The word “stayed” in it self seems to suggest, a passing visit. And if you travel frequently like we do, a hotel can become somewhat of a lacklustre experience.    Hotel 41, however, is in itself an experience, that should be on everyone’s bucket list at least once in your lifetime. Read on, and I’ll walk you through how this hotel has successfully encapsulated the true meaning of hospitality!  Upon arrival we were greeted by the receptionist in the private reception hall on the street level. The moment the front door closes behind you, the city noise disappears instantly. Your eye is immediately drawn in by the carved wood panelling, the striking black and white marbled floors and gleaming brass…"
December 2020,An experience beyond words,"We stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate my birthday, and what a treat!  From the moment we arrived we were treated to the most luxurious yet relaxed experience.   Welcomed with a glass of champagne, our registration card brought to us for signature, along with snacks, and then we're taken to our room where our bags were already waiting for us.  Our room was the Balmoral Suite and it's gorgeous - looking out on the Mews.  The bathroom is dated and an unusual configuration, but doesn't take away too much from the room.   The staff are just wonderful, we were never asked for a room number, they all knew us by name and all wished me happy birthday at various stages throughout the day.   It really felt like a home from home - if my home was luxurious, had an amazing fully stocked,…"
December 2020,Simply outstanding in the heart of London ,"We decided to stay at Hotel 41 as a treat to cheer us up after having so many plans scuppered throughout the year and what a great decision that was.   Everything about the hotel is first class, from the location (the Queen is quite literally a neighbour) to the greeting upon arrival, the welcoming staff and the luxurious room through to the abundance of sweet treats available 24hrs, the pre-dinner canapés and of course the option to “plunder the pantry” until 1am.   But the thing that sets this hotel apart from your usual 5 star hotel is the friendliness and approachability of all the staff. You expect professionalism at this type of hotel but it felt as if everyone went over and above and treated us as though we were old friends, which makes such a difference in making you…"
December 2020,Mr Bull,"One hundred percent perfect stay Nothing to complain about , what so ever Perfection at the highest level Already booked to go back Every single member of staff was amazing, and friendly  Thank you again👍👍"
September 2020,Amazing hotel - wonderful service,"We stayed here for our wedding night in September. From the moment we arrived the service was impeccable. We were greeted by a doorman who seemed to know who we were and whisked our bags away and directed us to the lobby. There, we were offered a complimentary glass of champagne and some delicious canapes (note, this is a standard part of their service, so all guests are offered this!). We were then shown to our room - we are a fairly young couple so had booked one of the most reasonably priced rooms, but found we had been upgraded to a suite which was worth about 3x what we had paid - we also had a delicious chocolate cake and box of chocolates in the room and pairs of slippers with his and hers bags for them. The upgrade was incredible, and the extras were such a thoughtful…"
December 2020,I promise that this is THE place to stay for that special trip away!!!,Well most of what I say here simply wouldn't do Hotel 41 justice. We stayed on Sunday 6th December for just one night but I so wish it was for longer. From the moment you arrive at the ground floor reception you just know that the beautiful hallway you know that you are going somewhere very special indeed!! From the gorgeous decor and luxurious furnishings everything feels quintessentially British and these guys just get it so right.  We arrived at 1pm and were greeted with what they describe as their tradition of a complimentary glass of champagne to help you adjust to your new surroundings. I have had worse greetings when checking in to a hotel for sure!!! We then enjoyed some afternoon nibbles in the residents lounge before being shown to our room which was a Junior Suite. We…
December 2020,Amazing weekend break,"Just back from a fabulous stay at Hotel 41.  The room was spotlessly clean and well equipped. During the turndown service the open fire was lit, a hot water bottle was placed in the bed and a candle lit in the bathroom. This made for a lovely cosy return.  The lounge is beautifully and tastefully decorated with a complimentary snacks area which was fully stocked with individually bagged and wrapped sweets and chocolates.  When we enjoyed our drinks by the fireside we were presented with canapés and squares of toasted sandwiches which were delicious.  The breakfast was perfectly cooked and presented and was on until 1pm which could be a bonus to many after a late night.  For me, the very best part of this wonderful hotel is its staff. Nothing was too much trouble for them. We…"
May 2021,A midweek break to Hotel 41 over the June half term was a memorable experience for all the right reasons,"From the minute we arrived until the minute we left, our experience of Hotel 41 was a fantastic experience. The staff were always very willing to help and provided a high quality of service. What made it personal was the fact that they always referred to us by our name every time we had contact with them. The room was of a very high standard and was well equipped with everything you’d need for a luxurious stay. The  food and drink at the hotel was very good. Complimentary champagne on arrival, free canapés in the evening and free food from the restaurant available 24 hours a day, made the stay even more enjoyable. We have stayed in numerous hotels around the world and I can safely say that Hotel 41 ranks in the top 3."
June 2021,A second excellent stay!,"It is difficult to write a review of this hotel which contains anything but superlatives. My second stay saw me have the room I asked for and a chance to discover their terrace where I ate on my first evening. The rooms are brilliantly equipped with anything your heart  may desire, turndown service and luxurious toiletries.The breakfast menu and the quality of the food is outstanding.The service is discreet and impeccable. A real home from home ! Just go and enjoy! You would be very hard pushed indeed to find a better hotel in the whole of the UK! I have booked to return in September."
May 2021,41 really is our home from home in London,"We have been visiting 41 for nearly 8 years now and we were lucky enough to squeeze in a visit last August and have just returned from another wonderful stay.   It really is “home from home” for us and we are so happy to see that the majority of the fabulous staff are still there and providing such friendly, excellent service. We were lucky enough to have the sunshine which allowed us to go up to the rooftop and relax. Our suite was every bit as good as the last time we stayed and we can’t wait to book our next trip. Such a very special place ❤️"
June 2021,Just sublime,"We can see why this is a world class hotel. The staff are fantastic and can't do enough. From the glass of champagne poured by the lovely Mr Jones on arrival, to check out when I was advised where to get some Lucozade nearby for my sore head!! (We had got engaged the night before so it's allowed...!) A very good excuse to visit every year. Thanks for a lovely stay. Jess & Ben "
June 2021,The next best thing to home!,"I call this hotel ""The next best thing to home"" but in many ways it's better than home! The service is impeccable but in a friendly way that instantly puts you at ease... it's like meeting up with old friends! We've stayed here 4 or 5 times now, the previous time was about 2 years ago but they still remembered us even though our booking history wasn't linked (that's how much they value their guests). I firmly believe the reason they are the no. 1 rated hotel in London (besides the beautiful decor, the exquisite attention to detail and the amazing culinary talents) is due to the wonderful people, especially Lauren and Steve, for whom nothing was too much trouble. We can't wait to return!"
May 2021,An unforgettable Mini Moon,"First of all we would like to say a big thank you to all the staff at Hotel 41, Lauren, Gabriel, Dean,  Marlene, and many more staff, you’re professional standards will be remembered, from entering Hotel 41, each staff member called us by our names, wanted to know are plans for the day, and on return asked about our day out. Always on hand to help with everything. We had asked for a standard room, and we were overwhelmed by the upgrade- thank you! We were greeted with champagne and canapés, so fresh and delicious, just what we needed after our journey, we sat in the lounge while our bags etc were delivered to our room, sipping on champagne and relaxing. Then we went to our upgraded room- wow, everything was top notch! A lovely congratulations slice of cake, and a hand written…"
May 2021,Our number 1 hotel,"Still our number 1 hotel. Absolutely amazing service from the minute we arrived. Such a special place to stay to celebrate our daughter’s 18th birthday. The staff are so friendly and helpful. Nothing is too much trouble, from providing hair straighteners to blister plasters. The breakfast included was amazing, as well as the delicious canapés served with drinks, endless sweets and ice cream and the plunder the pantry was a real treat too. The new rooftop bar is beautiful with fantastic views. The perfect place to spend the evening and watch the sunset. Special thanks to Andrew who was especially attentive and took great care of us all over the weekend.  We can’t wait to come back soon to our favourite hotel."
May 2021,Best hotel in London,"Very exclusive calm atmosphere. All staff members are very tentative and helpful, in particular Dean and David. Whether you have champagne on the roof terrace or executive lounge the service is second to none. We stay in london once or twice a month and Hotel 41 is our new favourite. Can't wait to go back Pure class..."
June 2021,A FIVE STAR STAY IN A FIVE STAR HOTEL,Amazing hotel which deserves its Forbes rating. From the moment you check in where your suitcases disappear and then reappear in your amazing room you know your stay is going to be wonderful. We had booked as a birthday treat for my husband and were upgraded to the Monarch suite which the attached pictures do not do justice too.  All staff knew your name and we were treated like royalty which is apt considering the view from our window was the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace. We were even lucky enough to see the Royal carriage going out for a practice run for the Queens birthday parade.  The Executive Lounge was exceptional and the various complimentary extras are a lovely touch. The roof terrace was open as the weather was fantastic and they even provide suncream and…
May 2021,Didn’t want to leave!,"This was a very belated 50th birthday night away - goodness me was it worth waiting for!  From the entrance right through to the rooftop bar, we felt instantly at home, very welcome and most definitely treated us like we were the only ones there.  All staff members are incredibly helpful, smiley but not over bearing which is quite a feat.  Hubby organised afternoon tea and romantic turndown  - be prepared to be blown away by exquisite service and such thoughtful touches.  We’re booking a return visit very soon to enjoy the splendour and the hidden gem that is Hotel 41 and the staff; don’t ever change as it all completely works.  Thanks again and see you all very soon xx"
October 2020,Been said before and worth saying again,This was my first time away since lockdown so I was slightly nervous. I wanted some time to chill and relax and there could be no better place than hotel 41. I'd researched it well and felt it took covid seriously. I did feel very safe.  The staff here are lovely and it is true they all remember your name even those who have not met you before. Every single member of staff was delightful and helpful  although Andrew did particularly stand out. I have stayed in a few 5 star hotels and although the hotels were special this really was the first hotel where I was made to feel special all the time.   Nothing seemed rushed. It was the perfect  place when travelling alone with the wonderful lounge space and its abundance of free goodies. The time I stayed it was very wet so lovely to…
October 2020,Excellent hotel! Will certainlyCome back again!,"We recent stayed at 41 for our anniversary, the hotel and staff are amazing! The rooms are excellent and lovely. We enjoyed our stay so much we added an extra night. We will be back very soon and recommend it to all. We also did the picnic in the park, which is a lovely treat for couples, highly recommend as part of your stay. Certainly the best hotel in London, and worth every penny. We can't wait to come back and stay again."
October 2020,Impeccable Service & Hospitality ," We stayed for one night for my husbands birthday celebrations.  Check in with the added bonus of complimentary champagne!  The gorgeous decor, friendly and knowledgeable staff and all the little touches.  The executive lounge was a welcome refuge after a day out in London with coffee and homemade biscuits.  The level of service is second to none.  This will be a our new base when staying in London - absolutely loved our stay and will be back next month if Boris allows "
October 2020,If only all hotels...,"If only all hotels were like this. Ideal location, excellent accommodation, friendly, cheerful, efficient and knowledgable staff. First class catering and excellent guest 'perks'. More like a comfortable and welcoming club. No hesitation in recommending 41 to anyone looking for somewhere well above the normal 'luxury' hotel."
October 2020,5* and more...,"We chose to stay in London for the weekend as COVID meant we had to cancel our wedding and decided to make it a luxury experience. Hotel 41 is a very warm welcoming hotel in which the staff make the stay very personalised. Nothing was ever too much for any of the staff. My partner loved the evening turn down where they light the fire and add a hot water bottle in the bed ready for when you want to turn in. Breakfast is outstanding and the arrival experience was great. The hotel stuck to all the COVID rules and even catered the complimentary extras to our room as we were unable to stay in the lounge after 10pm. There was hand sanitizer around the hotel and the staff were always cleaning where other had sat and eaten as soon as they left the room. The rooms are cozy, bathrooms are…"
October 2020,Amazing!!,"We arrived at hotel 41 and from the second we arrived the service level and attention to detail was outstanding! Once we arrived we were treated to champagne and snacks. We were staying for my partners birthday and there was a birthday cake along with other little touches in the room which made it feel that little bit more special. The decor was stunning & we came back from dinner to the fireplace on in the room. I’d forgotten my hair brush and they went and bought one for me and delivered it to my room!! Amazing customer service, the little touches and extras make this hotel a hidden gem! We will definitely be booking again soon! Thank you for having us!! "
October 2020,Simply the best...,"If you want the best hotel, the best staff, the best service, the best food, then look no further. This hotel is the best. We've stayed in many 5 star hotels but after staying at Hotel 41, I'd say this is in fact a 5 star hotel and the others need to pull their socks up. If relaxed and friendly yet an exacting attention to detail is what you want then book here. We can't wait to return again and again."
October 2020,Lovely birthday treat,"An absolutely amazing hotel that puts other 5* hotels in their place.  From the “happy birthday” plate with a scrumptious cake in the suite, the tasteful decor throughout, the wonderfully polite, friendly and helpful staff, to the fantastic breakfast.....outstanding.    Nothing seems to be too much trouble for them and we really couldn’t recommend this hotel enough.    Thank you Lauren Hargrave and Andrew Muir and everyone who made our stay so memorable.  "
September 2020,Perfect refuge during difficult times,"My Wife and I have always agreed that the best hotel, in terms of service, that we have stayed at is the Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok. An opinion has not changed since we first stayed there +30 years ago.  That is until we stayed at Hotel 41. The service here is superb, from the warm greeting from all the staff on arrival and whenever you see them around the hotel,  to the fact that nobody asks for any details when you order anything but the bill is correct when you leave. No idea how they do this. The hotel itself is very cosy and has the atmosphere and decor of an exclusive London club. The Covid precautions are appropriate and reassuring and don't detract from the experience. Finally now is the time to visit London, very few people around, you can see all the sites without the…"
October 2020,Slightly disappointed,"We were here for our 1st wedding anniversary and upon recommendation from our parents, so as you can imagine our expectations were high. We took advantage of the valet parking for £50 which although pricey saves a lot of time and hassle. One thing I would have liked, is that when we messaged the hotel to say we would like valet parking, they could have made us aware of the congestion charge now being applicable to weekends (this came into effect June 2020 apparently- how would a non-Londoner know this?) however upon checking-in, we were offered complimentary champagne and sat in front of the lovely fireplace and offered the complimentary snacks (Lindt chocs, nuts, Judes ice cream) whilst our bags were taken to our our room.   I was asked on several occasions (prior to arriving…"
October 2020,Brilliant place,"The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, we were treated with a glass of champagne on arrival, there were loads of complimentary perks, the food was amazing, the location is great for visiting the main attractions of London."
October 2020,Superb Hotel,"What a hidden gem! Fantastic facilities and rooms and the best customer service I have experienced in all my years of travel. We loved the ambience of the lounge and all the complimentary goodies, a shame we didn't try all the ice cream flavours, next time! Thank you for making our birthday stay truly memorable."
October 2020,Birthday Treat,This was the most amazing stay!! The staff were delightful and so lovely and could not have done more for us! ! We did not want to leave at all and was sad to go. We will definitely be back!! Thank you so much for having us!!!
October 2020,Sometimes its the little things...,"This hotel is superb for so many reasons but there are 2 main standouts: the outstanding service from each and every member of staff and the ""little touches"" that just set this a cut above. It starts with a glass of champagne and delicious little snacks on arrival and the five star treatment doesn't let up. From a candle being lit in your bathroom in the evening, and finding a hot water bottle has been put in your bed whilst you are at dinner.... through to a complimentary power juice shot in the mornings and Wedgewood china for in room hot beverages. I love how everything is 41 monogrammed - right down to the froth on your cappuccino. The staff were attentive, professional, polite and great fun too. Am already looking for an excuse to go back...."
October 2020,Impeccable service and  generous hospitality,"I stayed in Hotel 41 for business purposes with fellow colleagues for two nights.  The hotel group boasts that they are renowned for impeccable service and generous hospitality and I honestly couldn't describe it any other way. So I decided to second that in my review title and description.  We work for a translation company and we are all globe trotters so we are used to travelling A LOT, and going on many executive meetings around the world. I speak for all my colleagues when I say that we have all never had an experience like we had at Hotel 41! It is one to remember and a 5 star review is the least we could do!  What is very impressive, is how every member of staff across the hotel, restaurants and bars are all trained to the same level of impeccable service. It's so…"
October 2020,Birthday Stay,"Stayed for one night at Hotel 41 for my Birthday.  We were upgraded to a Junior Suite and welcomed with Champagne on arrival.  The service was immaculate and the staff were excellent and friendly, making my birthday very special."
September 2020,Mini moon stay,My husband and I got married Last weekend and spent our mini moon in this amazing hotel. The staff were helpful and kind and the hotel beautiful. We could not fault anything and felt like royalty staying here. I could not recommend more. If you want to stay somewhere stunning with top notch service and in a fantastic location then this is the place. Thank you hotel 41 for making our weekend unforgettable.
September 2020,5***** service and beyond!,"Stayed 4 lovely nights at Hotel 41 in an exec twin room.  From the moment we arrived, and were welcomed with champagne and snacks, to the time we left I felt nothing was too much trouble for the staff.  Want your breakfast teapot and cup warmed?  You only have to mention it once and it's all done like magic every morning thereafter.  And not once did we have to give our room number when ordering drinks.  They just know!   It's not pretentious, it's not stuffy - it feels very welcoming whoever you are.  Would love to return - trying to persuade him indoors that Xmas would be fab!!"
August 2020,Wonderful luxury in the middle of a fairly miserable 2020,"As soon as travel restrictions were lifted we knew this was where we wanted to be, our favourite city centre hotel. Things have obviously changed a bit - you need to wear masks in the hall, the ""plunder the pantry"" buffet is now table service - but it is still a little oasis in the midst of the busy city, even more so now with the fantastic new rooftop terrace.  Immaculate service as always - I have no idea how they always know our names and rooms but there was no need to show a credit card or key for our entire stay - we asked for whatever we wanted, it was promptly delivered and seamlessly turned up on the bill when we left.   We had such a perfect weekend we came back a few weeks later for another weekend."
September 2020,I cannot tell you enough how much I LOVE this hotel!,"If you’re looking for a great location, wonderful service and a beautiful hotel, stay here. Honestly I am blown away with how amazing the staff is here. I will definitely be coming back. The rooms are so comfortable and the lounge is stunning. We absolutely love it here."
October 2020,Amazing service ,I recently stayed here with my girlfriend for her 21st and couldn’t have picked a better hotel.The service was amazing with all staff members wishing her a happy birthday and receiving birthday cake on arrival. The Rooms are beautifully decorated and the location is ideal and within walking distance of many desirable locations. Will most definitely be revisiting.
October 2020,"Without a doubt, the best hotel experience!","From opening the door to saying farewell this hotel is simply exceptional. The staff, the quality of the rooms and service, the attention to detail and personalised touches made this a very special place indeed. After struggling to find a safe place to dine, we decided to go back to the hotel & had a great meal in the and a relaxed, (Covid safe), environment. I would highly recommend this as a place to stay and we will be back! Thank you Hotel 41 Team! "
October 2020,Fantastic- highly recommend,"Just returned from a lovely two night stay at Hotel 41. Great location, wonderful customer service and attention to detail. The hotel has made a lot of effort to comply with government guidance and adhere to the regulations. We were staying to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday and were not disappointed. Champagne on arrival at check in is a lovely touch and snacks are unlimited in the lounge. Breakfast was delightful and started the day well. Thank you to all the staff for their attentiveness and attention to detail. Highly recommend and will return."
October 2020,"good hotel , good food and very professional staff","good hotel , good food , the staff 5 ***** professional.  the price for the rooms excellent value  i would recommend this hotel  special mention to the cocktail bar and the Barman’s they are very good professionals."
October 2020,Outstanding service and hotel,"From point of booking through to departure,  our stay was outstanding. A welcome drink on arrival and the offer of snacks. Comfy rooms with extra touches, hot water bottle to warm the bed, chocolates, slippers and water. Cosy and peaceful nights sleep. So quiet! Breakfast was amazing with impeccable service from Andrew. The free judes ice cream, Lindor chocolate and sweet bags were very well received by my 10 year old daughter. Best hotel I've stayed in!"
October 2020,Perfect!,"Can only agree with others - this is an amazing hotel, the staff are all lovely, location is ideal, can't think of anything else to say! Will definitely be back as soon as we can and so glad we found Hotel 41"
October 2020,Unbelievably Brilliant ,"I really can not describe how wonderful this hotel is. From the minute we were greeted by the regally clad doorman, to our final delicious breakfast we were treated like royalty. Free Champagne upon check in, treats galore in the room, free snacks all day long, supper served on a tray to the room (all complementary!!) The room itself (executive King - was spacious, elegant and soooooo comfortable) The decor in the executive room is elegant, resplendent of Downton Abbey. The breakfasts are truly the best I’ve ever had with friendly, gracious waiting staff - a particular thanks to Dean, nothing was too much trouble. We spent three magnificent nights here and left, although a little downhearted, rested, energised and totally relaxed.....  I suggest anyone looking for 5 star luxury…"
October 2020,Don’t make us go home...,"Well it’s all been said a million times before but we may as well echo what many others have said before us... the service here is what sets it apart from other hotels. It’s warm, personable and charming from the moment you arrive and until you sadly leave.  A special mention to Andrew who took such good care of us and to David who treated my little girl like a rockstar for the evening - she had the time of her life making her mocktail!  This was a splurge for us and I was nervous about paying a large amount money for a 1 night stay in a hotel - but now, on the train home, I can honestly say I’m perfectly content with a the ding in my bank balance.  Nothing was too much trouble - we arrived super early and were given champagne (a lemonade for my little girl) and with in a few…"
October 2020,Treated like royalty,"Was originally booked into Rubens, but due to the pandemic, we were upgraded to Hotel 41. From the minute we walked in, our suitcase and coats were taken to our room, and check in in the lounge was so leisurely. Champagne & canapes on arrival, and then shown to our room. So luxurious and comfortable, the bed and bedding made us feel like staying in bed all day. Turn down service at night , and the fire was lit. Excellent breakfast in the lounge, where we also ate dinner as we did not feel like venturing too far. Although my partner's birthday was in July, this was a treat for her as I mentioned in my e mail to the hotel, and she had a birthday cake and chocolates in the room. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Would definitely recommend and stay again if possible."
August 2020,Bijoux and Gorgeous,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for a family birthday (89 years old!). From booking all the way to departure, the service was excellent. On arrival we were given Champagne and canapes to aid check in. And a wonderful birthday cake for our guest of honour. Our rooms were lovely, spacious, elegant bathroom products, a small box of chocolates (didn't last long!). COVID precautions were taken seriously so breakfast was served to table but the choice was excellent.  Would highly recommend (and save room to plunder the pantry at the end of the evening! Cheese and Port is a must!)."
September 2020,Service beyond the imagination,"Stayed as a 60th birthday gift. Didn’t know what to expect but service started before we went in the building, greeted by wonderful gentleman who Knew our name and got our bag and car parked. To a lady who took us to the lift. Up to 5th floor to be greeted by name and sat and served champagne and nibbles while they checked us in and told us the process of getting food and drink and breakfast in the morning. They took us to our room and said they upgraded us to a suite. I was overwhelmed,. A mini cake, chocolates and massive room. I was choked up. Every time we went to the lounge I felt like a princess. The service was the same for everyone. The staff here work tirelessly, we saw a number of people enter the lounge at once. They worked fast to ensure we were well looked after and…"
September 2020,Special birthday treat,"An amazing experience from start to finish. Lots of helpful communication from the hotel in advance about how they are addressing the Covid situation and regulations. Exceptionally attentive staff who immediately recognised that I am deaf and need to lipread so they discretely lowered their masks when they needed to speak to me - all very respectful and fuss-free which meant a lot.   We had an upgrade to one of their two suites which was an extra special treat. No view from the room but we weren’t their to look out of a hotel window so it really didn’t matter.   We loved the boutique, small and quirky style of the hotel. It was immaculately and stylishly furnished and decorated throughout.   It truly lived up to its reputation as the best place to stay in London. We can’t…"
September 2020,"100% reccomend Hotel 41, 5*","Our stay at Hotel 41 was perfect. From the complimentary champagne on arrival to be made to feel very comfortable and welcomed. The complimentary snacks was a lovely touch, the staff were very helpful and polite. We stayed in the the executive King suite, was amazing. Great size room, extremely clean and tidy, in particular we loved the bathroom! We would definitely recommend and stay again!"
September 2020,Wedding night,"One of the best hotels we have stayed in. First class service. Fantastic location. Amazing rooms and design. We stayed here for our wedding night as we wanted to stay somewhere special close to Victoria. Hotel 41 exceeded expectations. Late check-in, glasses of champagne on arrival. We were upgraded to the Conservatory Suite, which is incredible. It was a fleeting visit as we had a flight to catch the next morning - we only wish we could have stayed longer.  Highly recommend."
September 2020,"So good I added two extra nights to my stay, however","Currently staying at Hotel41. I'm spending about £1000 in total here. I'm a solo female traveller and it feels like nothing is too much trouble, the staff are amazing and really friendly. I booked in for a weekend of relaxation because of a stressful home situation.  However I've just had a call to my room regarding hair dye on towels.  My hair is bright red and has been since I was 19, getting on for 10 years. Its notorious for washing out quickly, and when I wash my hair it shows in the water. If towels are white, it shows on them in  pale pink.   In all the time I've had red hair, I've stayed in probably 100 hotels, all 4* up. I've never, ever had anyone call my room about my hair.   Not once, in almost a decade. Generally these hotels all use white towels. My hair dye isn't…"
August 2020,Are you kidding?? Wow!!,"I want to preface this review by saying that I am not a fancy person, nor do I know how to act in fancy ways. Haha. I've worked in restaurants and get a little uncomfortable when I'm on the other side of the table in a nice place, but let me tell you, right from the get go, you are floored by the service!! Ahhhhhhhh!   My partner had booked us in, and he spoke to Maria through email about a few things to customise our stay. She was polite and kind. Even with last minute requests.  When we arrived, Maria greeted us and we were guided to floor 5 where we went straight to the executive lounge. I believe it was Marlen that greeted us and Adele who was working at the desk. Mohan tended to our table and we were greeted with rose champagne and little snacks. We decided to stay for…"
September 2020,Birthday weekend away. ,"Hotel 41 has been by far the best hotel I have stayed at in the UK, and beyond. The service was impeccable. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, the personal touches could not be faulted. From the moment we arrived the staff were welcoming, and made us feel as though we were the most important people around. The food was great, cocktails were amazing, the architecture was incredible, all the little extras were of the highest quality. Andrew took care of us and went above and beyond what I'd expect. The rest of the staff were just as amazing and made our stay the most memorable and it was a pleasure to stay here. We will certainly be returning and cannot wait to stay at this venue again. "
September 2020,The Highlight of our Year,"To celebrate our Diamond Wedding Anniversary and my Wife's 80th Birthday we originally booked to stay at The Rubens at the Palace in April but Covid spoiled all that.  We subsequently rebooked for early September but were informed prior to our visit that we had been upgraded to a sister hotel, namely Hotel 41, which just happens to occupy the entire 5th. floor of The Rubens building with it's own entrance and direct access lift. This resulted in our experiencing a 3 night break in a fabulous location. To add further to our pleasure on arrival we found that we had been further uprated to an Executive King room. Bliss !! From the time we arrived to our departure we were in receipt of the highest service levels from an exemplary Staff who really got to know us personally, we were…"
September 2020,A hidden jewel,"We unexpectedly stayed here on route home for one night and cannot recommend this hidden jewel highly enough. We had been upgraded from their sister hotel and we had been slightly concerned that a hotel with such high credentials would feel uncomfortable and potentially pretentious but this was absolutely not the case. The serrvice, rooms and foid were a treat although we couldn't do the 24hour grazing pantry justice. We will definitely return...for a treat."
September 2020,Wow! What a stay,"We booked a stay here for our Wedding Anniversary.  Well i read the reviews, before making a choice of where we would stay. We come to London very often and have stayed in many hotels over the last 20 years. I have to say that our stay here was very different and very refreshing.  Great location and to say the service is fantastic is an understatement. Genuinely friendly service, from all staff. The hotel is very comfortable and has thought of it all.  We only stayed one night which was far too short, but we will definitely stay again. Andrew was a member of staff that really added a special touch to our stay, friendly and helpful where nothing was too much trouble.  What a fantastic hotel!"
September 2020,Amazing stay at Hotel 41,"Stayed here for anniversary weekend and had such a relaxing enjoyable stay. The staff are attentive but not in your face, they are very polite and always know what you want before you do! I would absolutely recommend this hotel, great location, will definitely return. For a completely flawless stay in London this has to be the place to stay, the reason they are the No.1 of Trip Advisor is very easy to see. Thank you Hotel 41 for an amazing weekend!"
September 2020,Great Staff make the difference,"Great location for trip to London, the service is excellent from arrival to departure we could not fault the service, the attitude of the staff and atmosphere of the hotel.  The break was very relaxing, with drinks on roof top bar, snacks in the lounge, every detail has been though through and execute to extremely high standard - we will be back and would highly recommend"
September 2020,Simon Harrap,Hotel 41 lived up to its review status. From the moment you arrive at the door the service is 100% and more. On arrival they welcomed us with our names and were shown to the executive suite for welcome drinks and to register. Our room was ready but we were welcomed with champagne and food. This is how the whole experience carried on until we left. It was just one magical friendly hotel and felt like we were the only people that mattered. Nothing was ever wrong and nothing was a hassle for the colleagues or for us In the hotel.  This is clearly the best hotel our family have stayed in over many hotels in this country or abroad we have stayed in.  Thank you for an amazing experience 
September 2020,Exceeding expectations,Stayed for 3 nights in conservatory suite.This is a beautiful large room on two levels a haven in the centre of London. This is a great hotel for a luxury break with so many complimentary treats a quiet main bar/dining area but top of the list has to be the staff who cannot do enough to make the stay whatever you request is made possible & they are simply the best you could find anywhere. We will return soon to our home from home
September 2020,A superb few nights,"My partner and I stayed for 2 nights and were made to feel very welcome. A complimentary glass of champagne whilst you are checking in and a variety of nibbles were a lovely touch. The staff are great, very attentive but not gushing. The room was comfortable and had lots of nice touches that were appreciated. We have both stayed in lots of hotels in London and would rank this in our top 5."
September 2020,Very Nice,"We visited Hotel 41 for 3 nights. We originally should have stayed at Rubens next door but sadly that closed temporarily ( however it does look lovely and we would still like to stay there eventually) we were allocated The Balmoral suite which was amazing, beautifully decorated and very comfortable beds and pillows. The turn down service was an added bonus. All members of staff were helpful and friendly. The Plunder pantry was a nice touch, I imagine pre COVID as a buffet it was spectacular. We used the roof top terrace one afternoon and it is a lovely sun trap, nice to relax with a glass of wine. Upon arrival everyone is offered complimentary champagne, a lovely welcome. Champagne was continued to be offered which we accepted, maybe a polite word informing us that these further…"
September 2020,6 star staff,"6 star staff customer service is excellent here we arrived to Landon champagne doors opened and closed for us our room set up with just what we asked for inside it the bedding and best best beds in London luxury linen and carpets and drapes, their was a few cleaning issues which I only wrote on a questionnaire because they were so good shower door dirty at the bottom and on one of the draws other than that they make u feel more than at home , after returning to the hotel after a day in London we went to the executive lounge to have toastier and canapés which is brilliant though I thought as it was an executive lounge you’d get lattes into the price but no do be careful as we ran a bar bill which we should of asked about as I assumed wrongly the lounge is lit with candle light…"
September 2020,Fantastic place and staff,Can’t praise our stay with Hotel 41 highly enough.  This was like no other hotel stay. It was such a great experience and we felt so well looked after by the friendly staff with such thoughtful little details added in too. There were 5 of us in our group staying in 3 rooms and we all loved it!!
September 2020,Amazing Hotel,I had booked to stay at the Rubens hotel but we were upgraded to Hotel 41. We stayed for 2 nights as had a day trip booked on the British Pullman.  This is an absolute gem of a hotel and we could not a fault anything. The staff were extremely friendly and could not do enough for you.  We were travelling with friends and I would personally like to thank them for upgrading them on their second night to the Conservatory Suite as a special treat due to personal reasons that I had informed them of before we had arrived. This made our stay even more special and we shall cherish these memories forever. 
September 2020,The most fabulous hotel.,"We can honestly say that this was a faultless stay. The hotel was perfectly situated, the building and facilities were immaculate, the breakfast was of the highest standard. But what made our stay so good, was the attentiveness of the staff. All the staff took the trouble to learn our names, chat to us about our stay, understand why we came to London and then went out of their way to help in any way possible. It’s only a little think, but that extra effort made it feel like a very special stay.   We believe this hotel sets a benchmark in hospitality that we have not seen anywhere else."
September 2020,Excellent Hotel,I have been visit London 6 times in different Hotels and this was the best one. Very friendly and professional staff.  They have an eye for details. Everything was excellent and the hotel is a jewel in London.  This was my best stay in the city. I will come back as soon as possible.
August 2020,Just as good the 2nd time,"We first stayed at Hotel 41 about 5 years ago and loved it. Wanting a brief staycation - we live in the East End of London - we booked 2 nights over the recent bank holiday weekend. This was our first time in a hotel in the COVID19 world and we were expecting it to feel pretty weird. The greatest credit to the team at Hotel 41 is it didn't feel weird at all. Apart from the requirement to wear facemasks in public areas, it felt normal. More than that though, it felt safe. It was clear precautions were being taken (for example, staff wore masks when they came close to you) and the lounge was set up for safer distancing.  And, onto the room. Just beautiful. Spotless. A really comfortable bed. Nice coffee and tea. Great bathroom. Penhaligons toiletries. And, as a same sex couple,…"
September 2020,This hotel is a gem! ,"This hotel is an absolute gem! We arrived for a one night stay to celebrate our anniversary.  Upon arrival we knew we had found something very, very special.  The staff were so welcoming and our car was promptly valet parked without a hassle.  One person who should receive a massive amount of credit is Andrew.   All the staff went over and above to make our stay special but Andrew really did go that extra mile.  His professionalism knows no bounds and we have never received service like this any any hotel we have stayed in around the world! The rooms were stunning and extremely comfortable.  The bar area was so special as it was for guests only and every whim was catered for! A lovely snack menu, a sweet buffet and endless supply of ice cream.  What a treat!  If you want to be…"
September 2020,Simply wonderful ,My husband and I were celebrating his birthday and our belated anniversary. We couldn’t have ask for a better surprise as we were upgraded to an amazing suite.  The staff here were just lovely and attentive and nothing was too much trouble. we decided just to stayed at the hotel as it was just perfect to relax and do nothing. I honestly think it’s was one of the best hotels we’ve had the pleasure to stay at and I’m sure that I would love to stay again for another very special occasion. 
August 2020,Great place to stay (with or without dogs),"This hotel cannot be faulted.  We were greeted by all members of staff that we saw on our way in and treated to some lovely canapes and glass of bubbly whilst checking in. We had a great room that accommodated myself, husband and our 2 labradors. The dogs were left some treats, beds to use and bowls.  Room very well appointed and seemed easy to request anything, if necessary..  Food was very enjoyable. A great choice at breakfast and the evening meal was lovely ( a good variety of dishes to choose from) Would stay again."
August 2020,"Birthday staycation , amazing hotel","We had actually booked to stay at the Rubens hotel , we had 2 rooms to celebrate 2 50th birthdays. Unfortunately due to the impact of Covid the hotel was not open and so we were contacted in advance and switched to hotel 41. Having walked passed the Ruben many times when visiting London I had never even noticed hotel 41. What an amazing place to stay , the staff cannot do enough for you, they contact you in advance to take care of any request, and the complimentary champagne on arrival was a real treat.   There are some things they needing to do differently due to Covid , which means all the treats in the pantry are pre bagged, but that's probably a good thing as otherwise you may have too many treats.   The rooms were lovely , with special touches to make the stay even more…"
August 2020,A birthday staycation done right!,"What is extraordinary with this hotel, which has been echoed in many reviews, is the level of service. Soon as the booking was made, the hotel got in contact, fussing over every detail for my visit. And they delivered! (I stated my dietary preference and they managed to source halal chicken for my stay). Nothing was any trouble to the team! The room is spacious, perhaps one of the biggest ones in London and well equipped. The Executive Lounge, which also serves as the reception area, is gorgeous and cozy. There is also access to the rooftop, weather permitting. And whoever came up with the idea of 'Plunder the Pantry' should win an award or a few. A special shoutout to Emma, Maria, Andrew, and David who made me feel welcomed here. Repeat visits are necessary!"
August 2020,A wedding anniversary stay at a wonderfully charming hotel,"From start to finish, the staff at Hotel 41 could not have made this occasion any more special and so very memorable. We were so well looked after by all the staff, and this establishment is a true gem in the heart of London. We were totally smitten with the decor and the finer details, particularly the Monarch suite we were upgraded to for our anniversary stay. We will definitely be coming back to stay again at this wonderful and charming hotel. Our anniversary meal at the Bbar restaurant next door to the hotel was delicious and we highly recommend it. A special thank you to Joanna, Maria and Sarah who went out of their way to ensure every request was taken care of at the highest standard - their communication in the week up to our stay was outstanding and very efficient."
August 2020,Special Anniversary at Hotel 41,"Some hotels have to  boast about their staff, faciities and service. Hotel 41 speaks volumes in its class, distinction and unreserved attention to detail. Us mere mortals on an anniversary stayover in London, could not believe our luck. We were shown consideration from the time we made the booking, care had been taken in keeping us informed of changes and  details; although the surprise to us was the luxurious upgrade and compliments  from the hotel and staff when we got there!  Hotel 41, is situtaed in a delighful part of London, we giggled in the tube station at the sign that said Buckingham Palace this way, as we headed home to it for the  evening so near to the hotel. The hotel gives you all the comfort and luxury worthy of the jewel in the 5 star crown that it is.  Other 5…"
August 2020,41. It’s what a ‘5’ really looks like!,Hard to imagine how you could find a better hotel in London. Absolutely perfect in all respects. Every single member of staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome. We chose 41 because it was the top-rated hotel on Trip Adviser and it’s a well deserved title. Like other reviewers it’s beginning to sound like I’ve been paid to say this but I genuinely have not! Never reviewed a hotel in my life but I’m moved to do it this time. Thanks to everyone at 41 for making our weekend so memorable.
August 2020,Simply the Best,"We have stayed at The Rubens on a number of occasions but have always wanted to experience Hotel 41 and we was lucky enough to do so this month as The Rubens closed due to low visitor numbers.  This truly was an amazing treat and words would never do this hotel justice.  We was welcomed by the most courteous staff who swiftly brought out a champagne trolley for us to enjoy a glass from, which clearly was a sign of things to come.  We was booked in for afternoon tea as part of our package which was as exquisite as ever. The whole experience was out of this world with the most scrumptious sandwiches and treats. All served on a truly royal stand   On checking in to our room we was upgraded to the Balmoral Suite which is like a room that we have never experienced before. The size…"
August 2020,Believe the hype!,"We stayed at Hotel 41 as a birthday get away, we were blown away by the reviews and had to try for ourselves.  From the second we arrived to the second we left we were treated to the most excellent, friendly customer service. The team at the hotel could not do enough for their guests and make you feel very welcome, very comfortable and very special. Their attention to detail and desire to tailor everyone’s experience is something I have never seen in any other hotel. An example was my wife being asked if she had enjoyed her birthday by a member of the team as we left when we’d not met that lady during our stay at any point, it was just the culture of the who team to treat everyone individually.  The room was well equipped and extremely comfortable with all the extras you’d…"
August 2020,An incredible example of customer service,"Our stay at hotel 41 was an incredible experience from start to finish. The staff are very attentive, without being overbearing and catered for our every need and want. It is always lovely to be greeted with a champagne welcome and we were thoroughly spoilt throughout our stay. The accommodation is beautiful, the food superb and the choice of quality drinks is also a great bonus. I'm not usually a review leaver but this place absolutely deserves a little something back. We are both key workers and were ready for some rest and relaxation, and that's exactly what we got. Thankyou, we will be back."
August 2020,Superb Relaxing Weekend At Wonderful Hotel,"Wanted to take my partner away for a nice weekend break post-lockdown, and couldn't have chosen a better place. From the warm welcome, with the lovely touch of  a glass of champagne, to the friendly, helpful staff, to the excellent room and the charming executive lounge area (with mouthwatering canapes and treats), everything about the weekend was first rate. Couldn't find a single fault even if I try really hard. Would recommend to anyone! Can't wait to book again later in the year!"
August 2020,A big birthday to treasure.....,"Originally we had booked to spend my 50th birthday in New York..... COVID put paid to that and when booked into the Egerton and subsequently moved to 41, I was firmly thinking 'Woe is me'.............. I could not have been more wrong!  From the stress free valet parking as we arrived and onward; the hotel is a little oasis of calm and elegance - reminiscent of the understated opulence of a library in My Fair Lady - the decor is just sumptuous and stunning. The food is very tasty and plundering the pantry is a definite must! even the experience of checking in was the most pleasurable I've ever known (whilst sipping a glass of complementary pink fizz).   What made it really outstanding though, is that - despite the potential for somewhere so glamorous to make for discomfort - it…"
August 2020,Mother and daughter weekend away,"The hotel is the best hotel I’ve stayed in, in London. Really welcoming and attentive staff, great personal service, beautiful decor, fantastic and very comfortable bed. The roof top terrace with cocktails is a ‘must’. There is absolutely nothing I could offer to improve our experience from start to finish. Well done to all the staff involved in making our stay such a wonderful experience. "
August 2020,"Fabulous hotel, generous hospitality which far surpassed our exceptions","We were transferred to this hotel when the Milestone (sister hotel) had to postpone its opening. We stay at the Milestone because it's located near to family. It has reviews similar to Hotel 41, but we've never really been 'wowed' by the Milestone, so we entered Hotel with fairly modest expectations.  I very rarely write gushing reviews but Hotel 41 knocked our socks off!  We received a very warm welcome from the doorman and were met at the elevator by friendly reception staff. From there we were served complimentary welcome drinks in the beautiful lounge where the check in process was seamless.  The upgraded room was extremely well appointed, very clean, it had plenty of towels and toiletries. We didn't get a turn down service because I think the hotel was at full capacity, but…"
August 2020,Birthday celebration that I will always treasure,"Myself and my mum stayed at hotel 41 for my birthday celebrations. We couldn’t have been more blown away by the standards of service we received whilst staying there. They provide you with so many extra touches to make the experience of staying there very special, which does not compare to any other hotel we have stayed in. From the measures put in place that ensured we felt safe due to covid restrictions to meeting all of my dietary requirements with the little treats which added to the experience. We could not recommend this hotel high enough and no longer want to stay anywhere else when we visit London. Thank you so much to all at hotel 41 for making my birthday so magical!"
August 2020,Amazing Place,"Where do I start, well from the time I arrived. The bell man was there as soon as my cab pulled up, he was ready and waiting to greet me and my partner.   The excutive lounge was beautiful, made me feel like a princess in a castle. The staff on a whole where very friendly and  helpful and alsways had a smile and a hello when they saw you. The room was amazing with the black and white decor, the bed was so big and comfy. The breakfast well this was on point, very nice and served with a smile.   The rooftop garden is a must if your there in the summer.   The plsce makes you feel very special within its enviroment and the staff make you that much more extra special.   Fabulous place to stay in London,  41 Hotel will always have a place in my heart and my 1st choice of somewhere to…"
August 2020,Mother and Daughter Shopping Trip,"WOW, this hotel is incredible, if I could give it 10 stars I would.  The staff are amazing from Trisha in reservations and Adele on Reception, everyone was so helpful. The service and attention detail cannot be faulted. The room we had was absolutely stunning and the location is perfect. We shopped till we dropped and the beds are very comfortable and the hotel is lovely and quiet.  The rooftop bar is lovely and the snacking station was very welcoming. Very organised for Covid, we felt very safe and will definitely be back."
August 2020,Anniversary weekend ,"Has to be the best customer service hotel I have ever stayed at. Hands down the best experience we have ever had. The food was awesome, breakfast snacks and desserts. Whilst the food options are served rather than help yourself at the moment to ensure good social distancing. Bottomless ice cream was available but the rest of the food was so good I did not leave much space. The room we had was a split level junior suite which was very well equipped. The turn down option was well done with fresh flowers and slippers and sweets. Bottled water in the fridge and a Nespresso machine topped up on request. I had about 6 coffees a day . The bathroom was the same size as a double bedroom. Fantastic water pressure from the shower and the bath filled in about 2 minutes. 3 TVs 1 in the…"
August 2020,Amazing,"What a fabulous place to stay, easy to get to, fabulous staff, amazing food and everything else you would want for a stay in London. The staff go all out to make sure you have everything you would like, anytime and nothing is too much trouble. Would recommend this experience to everyone. Ive already booked the next visit. Thank you to everyone at the hotel who made our stay very very special."
August 2020,Excellent hotel,We have just spent a couple of nights at Hotel 41 for a birthday celebration. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Staff extremely helpful and attentive. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and location of the hotel. We would definitely recommend and hope to return: it’s an excellent hotel.
August 2020,Another great stay.,"Second time at Hotel 41. Again, first class all the way. Thank you to all the staff, from cocktails to turn down, we loved it all.  The Covid arrangements were fine for us. Didn’t spoil our stay at all.  We will be back."
August 2020,5* for a reason - amazing stay!,"I stayed here last weekend as a weekend break. From the moment I arrived and the lovely woman at the reception knew exactly who I was before I spoke, I knew I would be in for a treat. The service is absolutely incredible, every single person is made to feel welcome and special.   I was taken in to wait in the Executive Lounge, which is an elegant room.  I was given the choice to have a complimentary glass of champagne or a soft drink. The executive lounge is also where the complimentary food is provided; this includes an array of snacks, a variety of different flavours of ice cream and a menu of food to order! The complimentary food is available from 8 pm - 1am (which is perfect for the midnight munchies!).   My room was spotless and the bed was incredibly comfortable! COVID…"
August 2020,Luxury Hotel,"Hotel 41 is a luxury hotel on the doorstep of Buckingham Palace. The staff are extremely attentive and do everything they can to make you welcome and ensure your stay is enjoyable. The rooms are very clean, comfortable and have all the luxurious finishing touches you would expect. Drinks are reasonably priced and treats offered during the day are delightful, the croque monsiuer is superb and the breakfast is the best I have ever had. I highly recommend Hotel 41 and can’t praise the staff that made our stay so enjoyable highly enough, a wonderful experience!"
August 2020,Fantastic Hotel and Service,"We stayed here for 1 night and we had royal afternoon tea included which was wonderful, the staff even opened up The Rubens tea room for us to sit opposite the Royal Mews. The staff were so lovely and friendly and we also ate in BBar next door which was great too. We would love to come back and stay again soon"
October 2019,41,The epitome of taste. Classy yet friendly. Pricey but well worth the tariff. Curry room is quiet the best Indian in London. Bar Guy went out of his way to make (mock) cocktails when I let slip I was a professional teetotaler.
August 2020,Amazing ,"We stayed here last weekend for our wedding anniversary. We wanted a change of scenery and a small hotel ideally. The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. We were treated like royalty, well we were on Buckingham Palace Road!!! We decided to drive, we normally use the train and tube when staying in London but used the hotels valet parking for £55 (24hrs). We were greeted at the door, bags out, simple as that... well worth the money.  We were kindly upgraded to a junior suite, located next door to the executive lounge/reception area, our room was fantastic as is the lounge area. We had a glass each of complimentary Lanson champagne upon arrival which is also a very nice touch.  There’s ice cream, sweets and chocolate along with more savoury produce in the evenings to…"
July 2020,"Perfect Birthday Celebrations, Thank You.","We visited  Hotel 41 for the first time on the 4th July 2020 for my Birthday, It was the day of opening up after Lock down and we were chuffed to be greeted with a Wonderful glass of champagne and Superb staff who made us feel at ease. We were upgraded to a Suite which was absolutely wonderful. Afternoon Tea was the best as was breakfast and we had dinner in the restaurant next door to the hotel which was also fantastic, this organised by the hotel for us as we wasn't sure what was available in the area. Cannot recommend enough, Wonderful staff, Lovely quiet relaxing rooms and lovely location.  We look forward to seeing you next year for our Wedding Anniversary."
January 2020,A Wood Panelled Oasis of Peace,"This is our 4th visit to Hotel 41 and every time we underestimate the impact of its charm, staff and atmosphere. I challenge anyone to remain stressed for too long ( I usually last 5 minutes!). The high ratio of staff to guest and informal atmosphere helps shed the worries of the outside world ( which seem part of another planet entirely). Add to that the luxurious rooms, a sumptuous bed and good nights sleep you leave refreshed and relaxed.  The executive lounge is a set out of a Jules Verne movie with globe, open fire, library (office if needs must), open pantry and attentive staff.  A great location overlooking part of Buckingham Palace grounds and close to so theatres and fine dining. Twenty minutes walk to Bond Street and Picadilly across Green Park.  Fantastic! "
January 2020,The BEST in London,"Stellar service and amenities. Every time we had a “wow” moment and thought it couldn’t get any better, they surprised us with even more amazing things. We didn’t want for anything. I’ve stayed in many London hotels, and this is the zenith! Can’t wait to come back."
January 2020,Just as everyone says,"The quality and amenities were every bit as good as advertised and reviewed. We have stayed at their sister hotel, Rubens, just about every year for there last few and love that. We decided to stay at the 41 for a special occasion. We used it as out ""home."" We have been out to dinner many times in London and don't eat a lot at dinner, so we just stayed there for the things they put out in the evening and had drinks. We feel like we got to know their friendly staff, and that made it even more comfortable each evening.  Since we didn't go out, we declined the turndown service except for one night. Should have got it every night because that was the BEST. Allow it to be done... The only negative, and this is personal to us, is how much they want to help. We don't need much…"
January 2020,"Hidden Gem, Outstanding service","Outstanding service from the moment you make a reservation to when you walk in the door staff make you feel welcome and try accommodate your every need.  It's a smallish hotel (40 rooms) and no real signage on the exterior.  They keep a receptionist in the lobby to direct you to the upper floors where rooms are and check in occurs.  There is an executive suite available for guests to access a light breakfast, quick snacks and water, coffee or tea during the day (tea and small canapes are offered early evening as well), drinks and other food are available as well.  Rooms are tastefully decorated in black and whites with all the amenities you would come to expect in any hotel.  They are good sized and comfortable.  Wake up calls are personally done with a knock on the door and…"
January 2020,We just love this place!,"Hotel 41 has fortunately become our home away from home. We love their philosophy of service and the attention to detail. Even the smell of the hotel is great!!! The staff are so friendly helpful and attentive. The evening pantry is fab, although never really needed....it has to be done! Best place to stay in London  "
January 2020,Absolutely fantastic,"Incredible hotel with amazing staff. This was our third visit and the standard is higher than ever. The staff are quite exceptional, the care and attention we received makes other hotels look poor. We arrived for my wife’s birthday and we had a cake in the room which had been upgraded to a suite! We had a lunch in b bar which is part of the Rubin’s and again exemplary service. We’re already considering staying in the summer and will defiantly return next January."
February 2019,Impeccable Service!,"Actually stayed her on our first trip to London in 2017 and we loved it. It was a Last minute trip, so we booked our room as we boarded the plane. Hotel 41 held our room without even taking a credit card to hold it, staff was soooo nice. Close to buckingham palace and some good restaurants. "
January 2020,Fantastic,Definitely the best hotel I have ever stayed in. Once again our stay surpassed our expectations.  The hotel is amazing. It's like a tranquil oasis in the middle of london. It's so nice we ended up spending most of the day relaxing in the beautiful lounge. Thanks so much to all the staff for making my husbands birthday extra special. We just can't wait to come back.
January 2020,Impressive hotel and extraordinary service!,This hotel I would love to give 10 stars!! They have superb in hospitality!! We stayed in many hotel but I would give hotel41 the best of the hotel !!many five star hotel should have learn this kind of hospitality but many place still act like robots  We stayed for 2 night accually I should decide to stay here the whole trip we were in UK anyway we will surely come back for the special room that have roof glass can see the stars that what the staff told us !! By the way we got upgraded to the room the have 2 stories ♥️👍
January 2020,Customer service experience,"I am soon to be staying at Hotel 41.  Positive feedback online led me to call to make an enquiry which turned into a booking.  Reason for my review is that the customer service experience delivered by Kirsty, the hotel's Reservations Manager, was first class. Working in management myself, I know it can be an arduous role sometimes, but the phone call to make my booking was informative, swiftly handled and a smooth process.  Already excited to for my visit to this hotel.  Thank you Kirsty & Hotel 41!"
August 2020,Mr Smith,"Stayed at Hotel 41 and forgot we were in London, Best hotel staff we have encountered, our room was emaculate and the Executive Lounge and roof bar was the icing on the 🎂 the whole building has character and a special feeling.  Definitely coming back!! ☺"
August 2020,"nice exclusive hotel, hidden gem with great service",We normally visit Rubens but as it is closed we thought we would try 41. The staff are excellent and very accommodating. The setup is slightly different to most hotels with the reception also being an exec lounge with complementary snacks. We hope to visit again in a few weeks time.
August 2020,Fiancé’s 50th Birthday,"This hotel was amazing! Everything about it was perfect. It was comfortable, cosy, classy and luxurious all at the same time. The staff were wonderful and ensured that our stay was a survival one! Special thanks to John (Head Concierge), Steve who served us lovely drinks in the bar, Dean who looked after us on the rooftop and Orci for making us feel at home. Also, the turndown service was impeccable, so special thanks to Adele and housekeeping for not only keeping our room lovely and clean and tidy, but for all the little finishing touches, such as a mini Birthday cake, chocolates, red petals, lip balms, little cord ties for our electrical items and many other little personal touches.   We were sad to leave you’d beautiful hotel and return to normality. We shall definitely be…"
August 2020,An amazing staycation in the heart of London,We snuck away to Hotel 41 for an overnight in London during a heatwave. The hotel was tucked away in plain site - it was extremely quiet and yet right next to Buckingham palace and near many of the great nearby attractions. It was very luxurious and easily one of our top hotels anywhere we have stayed. The small complimentary touches and gifts given throughout the stay were wonderful little surprises. The service was second to none. Highly recommend for those traveling to London for vacation or those within London looking to get away from their routine for a night or two.
August 2020,Birthday,"The most beautiful hotel i have ever stayed in, all of the staff are a credit to the hotel, friendly, kind and extremely helpful, will definitely be going back next year !! The executive lounge was perfect at the end of a long day"
February 2020,FABULOUS in every way ,"There really is nothing negative to say about this establishment. I’ve stayed at other Red Carnation Hotels and they are all wonderful and this one is just the cherry on the cake. Privacy, quiet, exclusive, beyond comfortable and the staff is thoughtful in ways you wouldn’t ever imagine. Alex Tollman was instrumental in ensuring our stay exceeded all of our possible expectations and I will definitely reach out to her anytime I stay in London. Also, the 24 hour honesty bar, snacks and food are great! The location cannot be beat. "
July 2020,A bit of perspective....,"We had a very pleasant stay here- but I really can't fathom the gushing reviews.  The rooms are small (even the suites are small); they are well appointed but they are not spacious.  Staff perfectly nice, but exactly as one would expect from a hotel.  There are no facilities other than the communal lounge ie no pool, spa etc.  Small roof terrace with restricted views.  Location wise it's off the main drag for hotels (ie if you are visiting London, the areas around Picadilly Circus etc are more central) but this is nice for access to St James's Park, which is one of the best parks in London in my opinion.  Overall, it's perfectly nice but really not the great fanfare that other visitors have written- I can only wonder how well travelled some of them are!"
July 2020,"Superb stay, beautiful hotel"," We had the most perfect stay, from the moment we drove up to have our car valet parked to the welcome we received. We loved having some time up on the roof terrace and enjoying the moment.  Every member of staff went above and beyond any expectation we had.  We also felt very safe after lockdown as the hotel has taken every measure with hand sanitisers, distancing and masks., nothing was too much trouble.  It was my husband’s 60th and you had gone to the trouble of upgrading us to a suite which was a lovely  and such a beautiful room. The loved the breakfast room and yet again the service was superb and delicious selection. We will definitely recommend the hotel and will be back. Their attention to detail was exceptional. Thank you. "
July 2020,Excellent from the second we stepped through the door.,"Hotel 41 far exceeded our expectations. We had seen the reviews and booked a single night there for a birthday getaway. From the moment we walked in the door there was a sense of calm and friendliness all around.   The check-in was wonderful with a brief chat and some champagne and nibbles. The room was lovely and the roof terrace a great place to enjoy a quick glass and some aperitifs.  The world's best cup of tea welcomed us back after a nice meal out in Knightsbridge.  We would love to revisit Hotel 41 again, after a single night it felt like we were saying au-revoir to some good friends."
July 2020,Anniversary Break,"We cannot fault this wonderful hotel and staff. We previously stayed in the Red Carnations’ Milestone and it was fab, but 41 exceeded our expectations, and more.   Expensive, yes but value for money? And more!   We felt very well looked after, some personable touches including a celebratory slice of cake and chocolates.  Steve and Lauren were wonderful hosts, also another worker (we missed his name) was also very hospitable!   We spent the entire weekend in the hotel bar drinking, we never felt the need to go elsewhere for a much over-due break from the hustle of life!   Thanks to all and we will be back again soon!   Scott and Stephanie Jarvie"
February 2020,Best in London? ,"Now I have not stayed in every hotel in London, so I can't definitively say that Hotel 41 is the best in London. But what I can say is when it comes to personal service, attention to detail and the feeling of exclusivity I can't see how any other hotel could possibly do it better. I won't go. Into every detail of my stay. Just know that if you are thinking of booking but worry that it couldn't possibly live up to the hype and all the glowing reviews you have read, trust me it will live up to and exceed your expectations. Couldn't have had a nicer stay. "
February 2020,Perfectly perfect,"So where do I start... at the beginning. Hidden away in plain view, you suddenly see the simplistic beauty of Hotel 41’s black flag waving in the wind. As the taxi pulls up, the beautiful doors are opened and you step into the old world glamour of days gone by. Beautiful black & white tiling  leads you past the reception with its leather armchairs and welcome drinks. The wooden panelling and brass railings shining as you climb the steps and enter the perfectly polished brass lift. Not a finger print in sight. The welcoming receptionist phones up to the fifth floor as you’re whisked seamlessly up into the hushed depths of the hotel. As the doors glide open the air of quiet elegance envelopes you in warmth and you just know that this is going to be an incredible stay. The black…"
February 2020,The hotel where nothing is too much trouble,"My wife and I had been given an experience voucher for lunch at The Ritz so we decided to turn it into a couple of days break away in London. Hotel 41 seemed to offer everything we were looking for to make it a memorable trip and so booked direct.  The hotel surpassed all expectations and it is fair to say that they couldn't do enough for you as a guest. Thought has gone into every aspect of making your stay as memorable as possible, from having a 'grazing bar' available throughout the day to a turndown service where they even pop a hot water bottle in your bed! The staff were so helpful and always ready to stop and have a chat about the hotel, London, whatever - nothing was too much trouble.  One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in."
February 2020,40th birthday surprise treat.....did not disappoint,"What an amazing hotel!!! From booking, to checking in, to the meal, nothing was too much trouble. We enjoyed a lovely meal in the English Grill and the breakfast was delicious! The hotel really does feel very intimate and luxurious. I booked it as a surprise for my husbands birthday and the little touches provided by the amazing staff really did make our trip!! Thank you xxxx"
February 2020,Never Fails to Impress,"Once again Hotel 41 comes up trump's, my girlfriend and I were in London for a theater visit and without hesitation chose to stay at our favourite London hotel, hotel 41. We were really fortunate, as on arrival we were told we had been upgraded to a suite, which was just magnificent. As always the service at 41 was impeccable from the moment we walked through the door to the moment we left. Nothing is too much trouble and every little detail has been thought about to make your stay a great experience. The pantry is great, its stocked with all sorts of nibbles and snacks which you can help yourself to any time night or day whilst relaxing by the fire in the beautiful lounge. One real nice and special touch I like is that the staff actually remember your name which really adds to…"
January 2020,An oasis in London,"My wife and I had the pleasure of spending an amazing night at this unique hotel. It was a milestone birthday celebration and we wanted to spend somewhere special. We took our time looking and found, what I can only describe as, the perfect hotel. Our experience from the initial booking to the final checkout was amazing, with the staff and management deserving most of the praise for the way we were dealt with throughout. It felt more like a private club than a hotel. I have travelled all over the world with my job and have stayed in some wonderful hotels but, if I’m honest, this tops the lot. We’ll definitely be back."
January 2020,Oodles of Charm,"Hotel 41 is a lovely and welcome throwback from the stale modernism that has become the signature of many a boutique hotel.  It’s an elegant and romantic little spot that enchants from the moment you enter.  The décor is a celebration of old-fashioned traditional English design, with a tasteful black and white color scheme.  The walls contain prints featuring a cast of characters straight out of English Lit 101.  Our spacious room had a gas-burning fireplace and a bathroom which contained both an old-fashioned tub and a shower.  The hotel itself is a quiet oasis, as it only contains rooms on the top of its 5 floors (41 is the sister hotel of the larger The Rubens at the Palace Hotel next door). It’s conveniently located within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Victoria…"
January 2020,"Overrated, disappointing, once is enough!","I have been to many places and choosing the hotel based on TripAdvisor ranking. Every time it goes well except this hotel. First, a woman who brought us to the room is not friendly and made us feel that it was an “look down service”. We had a Balmoral suite which I expected that it was going to be a wonderful room for us. Unfortunately, it was not. Worth almost 800 GBP I paid to see that 2 of the 3 bathrooms had problems with water drainage and cleanliness. Imagine, while you are taking a bath, you are almost flooding the room with water mixing with shampoo and shower gel!! Breakfast was just okay, but not worthy of it’s price . No one knew that my kids will get complimentary continental breakfast. I had to prove by showing the email I got from the hotel that if I booked…"
September 2019,Celeste,"This hotel is nothing short of absolutely, insanely spectacular. It deserves every ounce of praise it has received and more. I stayed here with my father, whilst on business, in September last year and have raved about it since. The service is out of this world, and the environment simply breathtaking. As a result, I instantly reserved a further 5 nights for a return visit next week.   My Dad is the most well traveled person I have ever encountered, and even he can’t stop talking about how special it is.  I will be back MANY times again for sure!"
January 2020,Perfect Stay and AMAZING customer service!,"This place is such a gem!! It is not only the most luxurious hotel we have stayed in, the attention to detail and making a memorable stay for each guest was so apparent. We are by no means fancy people but were excited to splurge for our 10 year anniversary. They were so incredible at making us feel welcome, excited for us to celebrate there (champagne and dessert in the room!!), and were attentive to everything. What I appreciated I think the most was that while we were of course splurging on some things, we were definitely not the fanciest/highest dollar people staying there and I never felt like they treated us any differently or wanted to help us any less. Such a treat through and through!!   In addition to all of the amazing things while we were staying there, I left my…"
July 2020,1 night stay for our engagement,I was speaking to the hotel weeks if not months in advance to try and plan everything so I could propose to my girlfriend of 8 years. I had high expectations after seeing other reviews but am happy to say they where all exceeded by a country mile.  The hotel its self was luxurious clean and beautifully laid out. The staff where what made it for us they where so attentive friendly and welcoming. we where lucky enough to be upgraded to the balmoral suite that was amazing.  We got engaged on the roof terrace and celebrated with complementary Champaign.  We are both already exited to plan our next stay.  Could not fault anything and looking forward to
July 2020,Luxurious central London sanctuary,We enjoyed a superb stay at Hotel 41 this weekend to celebrate my husband’s birthday. From start to finish staff did their utmost to offer friendly but professional service. Doors open magically with staff anticipating your next move. Hotel 41 benefits from a glorious roof top bar with spectacular views across London and the executive lounge offers a huge array of complimentary treats and a wonderful champagne trolley.  The location is perfect as there is so much within walking distance there is no need to worry about cabs or the underground at the moment.  With just 33 rooms and not open to non-residents the hotel has the feel of a private members club but without being stuffy.  Highly recommended if you are looking for a special and intimate hotel in central London for a post…
July 2020,A real discovery,Got transferred from the Milestone to Hotel 41 - what a pleasant surprise! Friendly staff with excellent suggestions for things to do and places to go. The room was perfect (got a free upgrade to their junior suite) and the rooftop bar is amazing. Snacks available throughout the day (ice cream as well:) and the best vodka martini I ever had. 10 out of 10 would recommend.
May 2019,Probably the best boutique hotel in London ," The hotel's English butler service is phenomenal. The room is a historic British style. The Executive Lounge offers all-day food and beverages in addition to breakfast. In addition to the charge, the wine is free, and a delicious hot dish is served during dinner. It’s a bit pricey, but definitely worth the money. "
May 2019,Treasured Memories at Hotel 41,"Unfortunately, the virus forced us to miss another special stay at 41 as we planned for early May 2020. 41 is truly is a home away from home. The people, the service, the ambiance, the special touches and treatments, the list goes on and on.   On our first visit, our honeymoon, we were offered the two level Conservatory suite and all the amazing extras that come along with the suite (including a glass ceiling to watch the stars at night). Champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, red roses, and romantic bubbles all truly delighted the senses.  We have been back many times since, but never managed to stay in such an elaborate and spectacular suite, but fingers crossed it will be available on one of our future visits. Since it is a very small boutique hotel, booking in advance is…"
February 2020,Your own personal palace.,"If you want to go somewhere special and really be looked after, there's nowhere better to go. It's like staying in your own personal palace full of lovely staff. Nothing is too much trouble and it's a little secret so great we don't really want to tell you about it."
March 2020,Excellent service in difficult times,"I have had to cancel my UK trip and stay at Hotel 41 due to the coronavirus and the travel advisory from the Canadian government. I had already prepaid a non-refundable fare for four nights through Expedia. I must command the utmost professionalism of the team at the hotel during this difficult time. Due to the rapidly evolving situation, there was some confusion and misunderstanding (I didn’t realize I was eligible for cancellation insurance until the government officially advised against travel, etc), and truth be told I was feeling quite stressed having to handle all the cancellations for the trip. They were amazingly patient and helped me with what I needed without having to go back to Expedia again. I imagine this is an incredibly difficult time for the hotel and the staff…"
March 2020,Remembering the best of times,"One of my fail proof strategies for a pick-me-up is to daydream about the wonderful experiences I have been fortunate to have.  Like most people around the world I have had to change my plans - perspective and reality check.  I should have been packing for myself and my son to travel to the UK for a very very special birthday party (think 50yrs of life, 18months of planning), instead I am preparing to be on the medical front line in Australia.  So I am daydreaming about where I would have been instead. About now I would be burning up the last of my adrenaline after our 26 hour commute and about to have the doors opened for me at Hotel 41, where we would have been greeted with helping hands, warm smiles and open hearts.  The foyer would have smells of fresh bread and coffee, a…"
March 2020,Perhaps my favorite hotel yet,"This is absolutely one of the finest hotel experiences we have ever had and we have had some fabulous experiences.  The staff goes above and beyond to exceed all expectations.  Our room was lovely with all the appointments with one could need.  It would be difficult to name one staff member as every single staff member was beyond warm and helpful.  they made me coffee at 3 AM and helped us rearrange our travel when the coronavirus created havoc on a global level. They made a cozy fire in our room and brought a toasty hot water bottle that my daughter clung to in this uncertain time.  Sadly, we had to cut our trip short but the staff listened to our woes, made my daughter hot cocoa while Mommy was on the phone for hours trying to get us out of the country, and rearranged dinner…"
March 2020,Superb Service,Had a fabulous stay in hotel 41. It is a small boutique hotel in a wonderful location. From the moment we arrived we were made feel so welcome by every staff member. The service from everyone was superb nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was delicious and all the nibbles supplied all day was a wonderful treat. Highly recommend and we will definitely be back!
November 2019,A perfect 10! 100% Simply the best,"This wonderful hotel consistently gets the most wonderful reviews and every one of them Is deserved. It’s difficult to know where to start. There are so many lovely touches. Check in is done with a glass of complimentary champagne to hand.   The rooms in their signature blend of black and white are stunning, elegant and comfortable. There are lovely toiletries in generous quantities. The Executive lounge is a beautiful place to sit with a wide range of complimentary food throughout the day / evening. The staff are all wonderful!!!  Everything is thought of and everything is perfect. I came back after an evening meeting to find my bathroom candle lit and a hot water bottle in my bed. From a business perspective- my desk drawer was fully stocked. Little things mean a lot. I’ve…"
July 2019,Where everybody knows your name 🎶,The London Series! Could not have picked a more appropriate Hotel for a hospitable stay in London. The moment you enter - the greeting is amiable and professional. Followed by a personal check-in with champagne service. All very nice - but what is more impressive is the personal attention to detail that is afforded each guest by each member of the staff. This type of service encourages a friendly atmosphere that makes one want to revisit! So I am planning another trip with my husband so he can experience “plunder the pantry “ at midnight! PS the location is fabulous.
November 2019,"Distinguished Service, Exceptional Accommodations and Historic Location","We made our yearly pilgrimage to London to celebrate our 30th anniversary and wanted an exceptional hotel. We have stayed with the Red Carnation family before and wanted to have a special experience for this trip so Hotel 41 was our choice. Hotel 41 exceeded our expectations. The location across from Royal Mews, Buckingham Palace and short walk to Victoria Tube and Train station was convenient to numerous historical and tourist spots as well as many dinning options. The breakfast at the hotel offered many options and the kitchen was very accommodating to our request. The afternoon scone and snack bar provide a quick pick me up and the English tea choice made for a nice afternoon break.  The room accommodation where truly 5 star. From the plush bedding, heated bath towels, fire…"
April 2019,Luxury and Location,"Room Quality: 4/5 Front Desk ( Check in & Check out Experience): 4/5  F&B including IRD : 2.5/5 Housekeeping of Hotel: 5/5 Vibe : Mixed Amenities:   Love the entrance to this hotel, very discreet. Really comfortable rooms with a lot of amenities of offer. What set them apart was their service, thoroughly consistent throughout our stay. Room for improvement in f&b though. Again very good location."
November 2019,Truly amazing experience,"We stayed at hotel 41 for an extended weekend and it is simply the best hotel I have ever stayed at. Their service, kindness and willingness to make our stay just perfect was top notch. I have never experienced anything like it. We will definitely be back again next year. Many thanks to the entire staff for a truly amazing experience."
November 2019,Very special! In a positive way... ,"Stayed here for a weekend. Kind of discreet entrance. You take the elevator to the fifth floor, where all rooms and a wonderfully traditional lounge, including reception desk, bar and snack buffet, are located. Very attentive and friendly staff everywhere. It feels like being at somebody’s home, in a very positive sense. We had a junior suite, mezzanine style, which we really liked. Traditional interiors with a quirky touch. Well equipped in all aspects. Impeccable service. Only reason for rating 4/5 and not 5/5, is that the price level is high, also with London standards... Guess we would stay here again though... "
November 2019,Weekend in London,"Because of extremely high ratings on TA my sister and I decided to stay in hotel 41 during a recent weekend in London. Location of the hotel is convenient, close to a tube station. First welcome was very pleasant, and introduction to the hotel facilities was informative completed with a glass of champane. A room was comfortable, with everything you can wish including a plate of frutes  and sweets. Breakfast had a great variety of hot choices but we missed fresh vegetables on cold meniu. Keeping in mind that it is a 5 star hotel, a glass of proseco or champane would be a must during a breakfast. I would not consider very professional to serve toast with eggs and pancakes by breakfast staff at the same time because a second dish became cold until I start eating it. Staff of tha…"
November 2019,The best,"We have traveled to many hotels and thought we had great service and amenities. But Hotel 41 has topped them all. The staff is considerate and helpful and welcoming, every. day. Not a day went by without them doing a multitude of things that made our stay even more perfect. They go 100% on anything and everything.  We cannot wait to return there. I wouldn’t consider staying at any other hotel in London."
November 2019,Great Hotel,Very special boutique hotel... terrific location for most activities.. staff couldn't be more helpful and welcoming... we stayed here a number of years ago and it was wonderful then and has not changed! Would highly recommend!
November 2019,Attention to detail ,"This hotel’s attention to detail is impeccable. On entering you are met by a lovely smell as well as a friendly person at the desk.  You’re introduced to the reception area & a welcoming glass of champagne.  Our room was beautiful! They have thought  of everything you may need (I won’t ruin your lovely surprise)  The bath & shower - could’ve stayed in their for hours.  The bed - stunning & so comfy and were turned down (won’t ruin surprise number 2)  In the evening there’s delicious food available .... I only have one criticism & that is with the reception being on the 5th floor, this is where you eat. I felt I was imposing on people eating their breakfast and when it was our turn to eat, we felt we were being ‘watched’. Would I stay here again? Absolutely!   "
December 2019,As wonderful as always,"Another pre Christmas stay at 41 and again it was wonderful.  This hotel is magnificent, greeted as warmly as ever, champagne by the fire and a cozy and comfortable room.  The honesty bar was stocked as well as usual.  We’ll be back next year and already can’t wait."
December 2019,This is England ,"This hotel is just amazing! Staff is so so nice, it is the people who make experience amazing! I travel a lot for work and Im sure I will come back! 👌 Everything is just perfect in there. I highly recommend Hotel 41, it is so England and so must see 👌"
November 2019,Running out of superlatives ,"It was our first visit back to Hotel 41 since I had my stroke last year,  so it was a well anticipated treat. It did not disappoint. The visit included a chance to see Le Mis in Concert and a catch up with family.  From the moment we arrived it was total chill and comfort. From being welcomed by name and the eagerly awaited glass of champagne through to the perfect service at all times. How many hotels would remember I asked for the Scotsman newspaper on our previous visit, far less go to the effort of having one printed off. It was much appreciated.  On behalf of Rachel and I would like to say thanks for the very warm welcome shown to her brother, sister in law and niece when they visited us. I am still managing my post stroke energy level so the the Executive Lounge was the…"
December 2019,Unique piece of experience,"We have been visiting Hotel 41 as a guest for a few years now and every time it feels more like coming home. For example, the ""turn down"" service makes it a party to go back to your hotel after a great evening out. The excellent bed and bed linen ensure that getting up is a challenge, far too comfortable to lie down! Having breakfast in the library is cool every day, delicious treats. All in all a very nice welcoming atmosphere, truly a unique piece of experience in London."
November 2019,Needs a Few Improvements,"Hotel 41 is one of the best hotels in London. This month I stayed two different times, in two different rooms, for a total stay of 9 nights. Starting at the greeting at the door the staff strives to do their best to make guests feel welcomed. Two of the hallmarks of the hotel are its unique rooms (no two alike except the black-and-white decor) and the raid-the-pantry nightly spread.  I have always been quite pleased with my stays.  On these stays, however, I noticed serval things that didn’t seem up to the standards that Hotel 41 espouses. Although I enjoy differences between rooms, not all are created equal. Although both rooms were in the same category, one room had a fireplace and spacious bathroom while the other was cramped.  The smaller room had a television mounted on the…"
November 2019,A truly magical stay,"I would firstly like to start by saying a huge and very big thank you.  I can absolutely see why your establishment is the number 1 boutique hotel in London.  We had a fantastic stay.  I wish I could remember all the names of every staff member who showed kindness and amazing hospitality, they all did:-   We were checked in by Magdalena and Andrew my partner was very impressed with his knowledge about absolutely everything! We were served breakfast in our suite by two very accommodating staff members. We were poured drinks and assisted by another staff member at the hospitality bar during the evening. Our bags were moved to a hospitality room where we were able to stay for a further couple of hours until our travel time came.  I had booked surprise massages in our room and…"
December 2019,Amazing stay for our wedding anniversary,"Reaching our 10th wedding anniversary, we wanted to do something special, but with young children, we were a little limited in how far and how long we could stay away.  Having seen previously that Hotel 41 has always been highly rated we decided to treat ourselves to a night there. We booked a few months in advance and was contacted by the hotel directly to ask if we required anything special during our stay.  I liaised with the hotel a few times before our reservation and the hotel was always swift to respond and were very accommodating of any requests I had. We were asked to complete a form a few days before our stay making sure that all our needs would be met.   On arrival, we were greeted by very friendly staff and shown upstairs to the check-in desk. We were offered…"
December 2019,Consistently brilliant,"We've been staying at 41 once or twice a year for the past 6 years or so. And it never fails to disappoint.  It's a boutique hotel beautifully decorated and maintained. The rooms and executive lounge are always impeccable - food is universally good. It's classy old school decor but with lots of different, thoughtful touches.  But what makes 41 stand out is the brilliant staff - many of whom have worked their for years. It's always a pleasure to see Magdalena who is always so wonderfully helpful. This time we met Andrew who astonished me with some little touches. But all members of staff give brilliant service so it's always a pleasure to return.  I'm already planning a few trips for next year. I was wondering whether to review because I don't want others to go there !"
September 2019,Simply....WOW!!,"What a hotel, what an amazing experience, what wonderful service! My partner and I decided to stay here recently as were in London to celebrate our anniversary and are glad that this was the place we choose.  Everything about the stay was amazing! We was even upgraded to the conservatory suite which was stunning and like nothing we'd ever stayed in before.  My one minor tiny complain is that there was no salt or pepper in the shakers we were given with our breakfast in the morning and feel this should have been checked first however like i said, tiny, minor complaint.  Now that we have stayed at 41, the bar has well and truly been set and will certainly be returning next time we are in London to our now favourite hotel.  Keep up the good work!!"
November 2019,Small hotel with a big heart,An exceptional small hotel with a big heart. From arrival to departure we were greeted by name and with wonderful service from every staff member that we met. There was lots of little treats and surprises throughout our stay. We enjoyed a great big breakfast that kept us going all day until returning back to the hotel and the snack bar! Then some lovely canapes with a cocktail before heading off for dinner. The bedroom had everything that we required and more. Our two night stay was not long enough to enjoy all that the hotel has to offer.
January 2020,Brilliant stay for our wedding anniversary,"Cannot leave a high enough review. What a gem of a hotel. Absolutely fabulously appointed small boutique hotel, wonderful staff so accommodating and friendly. We stayed overnight for our wedding anniversary and the staff and hotel spoilt us beyond any expectation, upgraded our room, special anniversary cake and congratulations but even had it not been our anniversary the staff were amazing and the room lovely. Perfectly situated to walk into LONDON. Will be recommending to my friends as know they will love it. Thank you hotel 41"
January 2020,Another visit to 41 and just as fantastic as usual!,"The hotel is not big which is perfect.  The service is fantastic with lovely staff, always attentive, friendly and prepared to do the utmost to make you feel welcome and important.  The room is elegant, contains all that you need and a little bit more.  The hotel is situated close to Buckingham Palace, ie very central. And finally an amazing and generous breakfast! /Emilie"
January 2020,Remains special!,"Once again, we enjoyed our stay at 41 really much. This time we went to London as a gift for my sons' graduation. When we arrived in the room there was a surprise cake for him. That was amazing!! Apart from that the hotel was perfect in all aspects and the staff was wonderful!"
December 2019,New year escape,"Another fabulous stay at the 41 right from check in all the staff make your stay just so comfortable anything you need they will get it for you, plunder the pantry in the evenings is great the breakfasts are amazing the hotel is warm and cosy will be back soon"
October 2019,My new favorite hotel in London,"I fell in love with this boutique hotel! I came with my son Hugo for Halloween and the whole team was ever so friendly with us! The room we had was cosy, with a fireplace that was lit every evening: what à delight! My son was thrilled to find chocolates and Halloween goodies in the room: thanks again! We enjoyed playing games in the evening in the main room by the fireplace while enjoying snacks from the buffet. The hotel is perfectly located right next to thé royal mews / Buckingham and St James Park. We will definitely come back soon! Thanks again for a great stay!"
December 2019,Amazing as always,"Another amazing stay, thanks to all the team who work so hard to ensure you have a great time. Really nothing is to much trouble. Stayed for 4 nights over New Year and everything was perfect, shame to leave and come back to reality."
December 2019,Classic Elegance,"We stayed here for 5 nights in December.  If you want to feel like you are a guest at someone's private estate, this is the place for you.  Their hospitality surpasses any 5-star hotel we've visited.  Their friendliness and concern for any need you may have is truly genuine."
December 2019,A hotel that goes above and beyond ,Always a joy to return to Hotel 41. The staff are fantastic and the attention to detail above and beyond. A stressful stay for me due to some business requirements and a special thanks to Marlen who was incredibly helpful.  Thank you guys... wouldn’t dream of staying anywhere else when we visit London.
December 2019,Home from home,"We’ve had two recent trips to 41 and the first of these reminded me why we love this hotel so much.  There really is nowhere else quite like it. The real key is the service level. Staff take care to know you by name and understand and note carefully your habits and needs.   For me it represents excellent value for money. This does not mean it is cheap but it does mean that we get a service which reflects what we’ve paid.  The ‘plunder the pantry’ is, as far as I know, unique and is, quite simply, superb for an inveterate ‘snacker’ such as myself. It’s what I would do at home!   The executive lounge is a great place to relax and take a drink, and is a welcome break from the frenetic pace of London. The drinks prices are no different from any other London location but the ambience…"
December 2019,Perfect for Birthday night out in London,"What a gem. Booked for a nice place to stay as part of a birthday night out. Lovely hotel - great rooms, decor, bar lounge area beautiful and relaxing, service exceptional. With all the bars and restaurants nearby there are lots of options - will have to come again to try bbar which was closed on Sunday. Central to tourist sites if that’s what you want - Westminster, Buckingham Palace, parks and so on, but also perfect for a relaxing place to stay as part of a good night out. Loved it, will stay again. "
November 2019,WOW! This is just a fantastic and special hotel,"Firstly the location is ideal for London Eye, Westminster etc but as soon as you walk through the door you enter somewhere very unique and charming.  Staff so helpful and genuine, rooms the most comfortable we have every stayed in, and the fire burning blissfully away when you come in from the cold was very welcoming. The only hotel I have been in where a hot water bottle is put in the bed with his/her slippers by the side.The executive lounge offers a very fine choice of wine and spirits as well as beers and soft drinks.  The ambience of the room encourages you to just wind down and relax, horderves and snacks in abundance throughout the day and evening.  Breakfast menu offered something for everyone and you could even add your choice of what you wanted.  The standard of food,…"
November 2019,We enjoyed a three night stay at the 41,"It is a unique botique hotel that has a great location accross from Buckingham Palace. It is within walking distance to many of the historical sites in London. The Hotel itself is very comfortable and we had a two level suite, sitting room below and bedroom above. Plenty of space for the two of us. 'There was an executive room for snacks and drinks. The staff was excellent and provided friendly and fast service. It was a great stay."
November 2019,Fantastic,As this hotel won best hotel in London we booked it for our anniversary as a treat.   But with such great reviews I had high expectations and I was not disappointed.  It is the best hotel we have ever stayed in.  Yes it’s a considered purchase but omg it’s worth it.  Small things like a hot water bottle in your bed make such an enjoyable stay.  We are looking to make this our annual anniversary celebration
November 2019,Exceptional!,"The service was simply exceptional.   Friendly, attentive, proactive, generous, warm, welcoming and with great attention to details. The executive lounge has an amazing vibe, warm yet luxurious, rich but not overwhelming, intimate though you still feel part of the scene. And the treats... they just keep flowing in. In 3 words - above and beyond!  The room is great. Filled with all the amenities one might want. Super comfortable bed and pillows, slippers, good A/C, sound proof, separate bath and shower, big and soft towels, robes, very dark when your turn off the lights, choice of morning papers, sweet treats, espresso machine and water (still and sparkling). Seriously, not much can be improved.  Well done."
November 2019,Anniversary ,"We stayed here for two nights on this occasion because one didn’t feel enough last time, on our next visit we hope to stay for three!  We can not recommend this hotel enough from the glorious decor to the wonderfully friendly, helpful and attentive team of professionals who work here to make your every moment as relaxing and enjoyable as humanly possible.  From the welcome glass of champagne at check in to the delicious complimentary range of food offered at various times of the day, Hotel 41 try to make you feel at home (if you lived in such a beautiful place!) and with all the effort put in by the fabulous team they certainly succeed! We couldn’t dream of living a real everyday life like this although I’m sure some of their guests are this lucky but the main reason it works so…"
November 2019,Birthday celebrations,"Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic - says it all. This hotel goes above and beyond. Cannot recommend this hotel enough for service, attention to detail, comfort and style. The hotel went out of its way to make our stay for birthday celebrations so special. A particular mention to Andrew & Steven for their attentiveness and enjoyable company. I particularly liked my hot water bottle in my bed when we arrived back from the theatre -little touches like these make this such a stand out hotel.  Thank you again everyone at hotel 41."
November 2019,"Super friendly , highly professional oasis in central London","This property is superbly situated near theatre and Buckingham palace and although is in the heart of the city is very calm and quiet. The staff are amazing , warm and friendly but impeccable service and great attention to detail.  Taking time to find out special requests like transportation , bar service to the room etc . Everything arrived on time and in good order and they were lovely touches to like and honesty bar snack buffet and even hot water bottle in your bed when you arrive back at the end of the night. All in all great service and would definitely stay here again if I was needing to stay in central London!"
November 2019,Amazing stay from start to finish,We have stayed in some amazing hotels all over the world. Not only is this hotel a beautiful find not to be missed with great food and complimentary snacks. I can honestly say this the customer service and overall standard of service in general for this hotel was the best I have ever experienced not only in 5 star hotels in the uk . (We usually stay in the savoy or the shard) But I would go as far as to say the best on a overall all international level. From the second we arrived to the second we left. We had 24/7 service of the highest standard from everyone we met. Special mention to Andrew who went above and beyond to make our stay extra special and his professionalism along with his people skills was one of the main reasons I am writing this review. I can not recommend this…
October 2019,Delightful,Staying at this hotel is like surrendering yourself to the ministrations of an attentive Nanny. You feel cosseted and cared for without being smothered. Just lovely. The staff are uniformly kind and intuitive and I can not recommend more highly
November 2019,The best home from home.,"Decided to break our “stay at the Savoy” tradition and try a new establishment ...  I’m not one who leaves reviews often, stayed at many five starts throughout the world...  this one deserves my comment.  From the friendly greeting to the hospitality from start to finish. The staff could not do enough.  We had the conservatory suite... beautiful duplex arrangement more than satisfied me.   The “executive lounge” sat by the fire with tip top service and array of canapés, drinks and friendly conversation in the most beautifully ambience ...  Particular mention to Andrew, he was an amazing host and the most engaging conversationalist.  I know where I am staying from now on each time I am in town...   Can not recommend enough.   It is also worth a mention that I have unwittingly…"
March 2020,Best hotel in London,I’ve stayed in many hotels in my time but none were as special as 41. From the moment we arrived we were well cared for. Everyone was really pleasant and all went the extra mile. A gem of a hotel in a mediocre world
March 2020,Exemplary hotel experience,"All aspects of the Hotel 41 experience were beyond our expectations.   The staff is warm, accommodating and skilled.  Every possible contingency was  attended to and anticipated beforehand.  Rooms are beautifully decorated, impeccably clean and perfectly appointed.  The room's  fireplace added a special warmth to the setting.   In house dining with delicious breakfasts, wonderful snacks, and fabulous evening buffet complimented the hotel experience.  This hotel should be on anyone's list if service, luxury and location are priorities.  Looking forward to a return visit in the near future.  Thanks to all.    Best regards, S."
February 2020,Best hotel in London,"A wonderful hotel with big rooms, but feels like a home. The staff is amazing, extremely services minded and friendly. They did little things, like preparing your room for night by lightning some (fake) candles and putting on relaxing music, even giving you a weather prognosis for the next day."
February 2020,A magical stay !,"We read a lot of reviews about the 41 before booking a room. A lot of them were pretty nice. We were scared by a few ones which were saying it was a not so perfect experience and kind a waste of money. Being a long time faithful guests of red carnation properties, we trusted our guts and we tried it anyway. Let us just say this: the 41 is incredible and will fullfil all your expectations and beyond.  The staff was helpful without being intrusive. Always with a smile, they are quickly catching on all your needs and habits, even after only one day. The lounge was truly wonderful, classy chic, cozy, with delicious food (canapés to die for, a different buffet every day, with a high level of quality and savoir-faire. The label tags were missing one day, but you got to have the…"
February 2020,Just outstanding!,"A life spent in hotels has allowed me to define the perfect hotel = and 41 is it. From the moment we arrived the personal attention to detail started - and even learnt and used our names - Wow! The standard of service, the amazing staff, the food and drinks in the lounge and a really comfortable bed and quiet room. This hotel defines what a 5 star hotel should be and how it is done. You must try it and see for yourself, and its in a great location and very well served by Victoria for the Tube."
February 2020,Superb! 100% Perfect ,"So I was looking for a supremely comfortable hotel in central London following the change of The Arch - my long term favourite - to another style after a huge refurb. I came across this hotel on Trip Advisor and it seemed to be consistently number 1 in London   Surely not? Oh yes!   Everything about this hotel is completely perfect - the location, the comfort level of the rooms, the staff, the complimentary food in the Executive lounge, the hot water bottle you find in your bed at night, (with lavender pillow spray) the candlelit bathroom on your return at night the luxury toiletries and the superbly comfortable beds.   It is  supremely comfortable without being ‘over the top.’ Every single member of staff is a credit to the hotel, Having found Hotel 41 - that’s it - I won’t be…"
February 2020,Luxury = Hotel 41,"We have stayed at Hotel 41 on numerous occasions and like with our previous stays, the hotel did not disappoint.  For us, when in London our address will always be 41 Buckingham Palace Road @ Hotel 41.  The level of service of the staff along with the their personal touch is second to none.  The staff in the executive lounge are there to pamper you and provide for your every need, and they did not disappoint.  The food is exceptional, the accommodations are first class and the service is second to none.   What else could you possibly ask for?  My wife and I already cannot wait until our next stay."
February 2020,Luxurious Oasis in London ,We were delighted to return to Hotel41 for our annual February stay and enjoy once again this amazing oasis in the heart of London . From the moment you walk through the door you feel calm and relaxed as Malcolm and his fantastic staff make you feel so welcome and do everything possible to ensure you have a marvellous stay ! We were extremely fortunate to be upgraded to a suite which we so appreciated and it just put the icing on the cake as it were ! I won’t go into details of what great service is available as it’s well documented in other reviews but just like to say if you are ever in London and want to have a unique luxury hotel experience look no further than Hotel 41 its the best !! Thank you everyone for making our stay so memorable and we are looking forward to next…
February 2020,I am in love with this hotel,"I booked two rooms in this hotel.  One for my husband and I, and another for my daughter coming in from Ireland.  This hotel has to be one of my favourites.  From the outset, the reception and staff are excellent.  At check in, you are greeted with champagne and the process is seamless.  In the executive lounge, there are always drinks and snacks available.  The room is cozy.  Lots of outlets and the bathroom appears small, but there is plenty of room for storage of your toiletries.  Turn-down service is heavenly.  A hot water bottle is placed in your bed every evening.  I cannot say enough good things about this hotel.  I have stayed at Waldorfs, Fairmonts, St. Regis, Belmonds, etc., but this is one of my preferred hotels."
November 2019,Outstanding and exceptional Property!!!,The food is amazing both at breakfast and in the evening at both of their restaurants. From the first salute of the security guards to the excellent service by the pool This is an amazing hotel I have ever stay.
October 2019,Narnia is Hiding in London,"Behind a door on Buckingham Palace Road is a hidden world of calm, sophisticated luxury. Part of me wants to tell you about it, and part of me would like it to remain a secret! Hotel 41 is as wonderful as everyone says it is: a place to hide away from the busy noise of the city; a place where the service is unparalleled; a place where nothing is too much trouble; a place to tell your friends about (especially friends who you think deserve to have a wonderful few days in a magical world tucked away behind a simple glass panelled door)."
October 2019,Simple amazing. Simple perfect. Amazing perfect hotel. Must see,"Not sure how I can express in words how amazing this hotel is in London. Of course I found it on Trip Advisor. And they have rarely steered me wrong. From the moment we walked in, we knew it would be magical. Greeted with a glass of champagne. Exceptional service. Amazing location. Simply perfect. They were on point from the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out. The person checking us in (forgot his name, young male) made us feel at home, took extensive time to explain London and where to go and even gave his own point of few. We have the privilege of staying in the Master Suite. If you can do that, do it! Two story suite with a glass roof. Perfect. Thank you for making this London experience unforgettable. "
October 2019,A hidden gem,"Hotel 41 was recommended by a very good friend Eddie and I can’t thank him enough.  We were greeted with smiles and excellent hospitality throughout our stay for our anniversary. On arrival glasses of rose champagne were offered and thankfully consumed. A delicious cake and sweets were awaiting along with a card from management. There are many good restaurants around too and when we returned back from a delicious Lebanese dinner nearby, the fireplace was on, nicely heating the room and a hot water bottle ready, making the homely feel even more enjoyable. The continental breakfast in the morning was delicious with lots of choices on offer. Staff in the lounge were always nearby ensuring that everything was impeccable.  This is a must stay hotel for couples looking for relaxed…"
September 2019,Sublime hospitality!,"I must admit that as far as a boutique hotel is concerned I don't think you can do much to improve this hotel.  The service from the time of check in is simply sublime from start to finish.     We were upgraded to a suite as a start and the value-add's just do not end, another dimension which makes it no surprise for their #1 rating on Trip Advisor.  From the executive lounge greeting with some bubbly, the whenever/whatever button in your room, the 24/7 treat room, to the handpicked list of whisky bars left in our room there is simply no end to the staff going the extra mile for guests.  The guest services team at the desks in the lounge are remarkable.  Truly at the top of the top when it comes to guest services and warm hospitality.   My only criticism would be the concierge…"
October 2019,"Fantastic stay, outstanding service!!","The reviews aren’t wrong, the service at Hotel 41 is outstanding. I stay in lots of very nice hotels throughout the year, all over the world and very rarely go out of my way to write a review. I couldn’t help myself with Hotel 41!  My wife and I checked in on Thursday and stayed until Sunday without the kids for a romantic, relaxing break.   The hotel is located near Buckingham palace which is close enough to most things.  Upon check in we were helped up to the executive lounge, you are greeted with a glass of fiz ( so nice we have order a crate full! )  The staff make this hotel so special, David did a great job of welcoming you, checking you in, showing you to your room and making you feel comfortable. The ‘whenever/whatever’ button in your room does exactly what it says.....…"
October 2019,"Hotel is truly a gem, but the location may hinder us staying there again","Full disclosure - London is my favourite city in the world to visit, and I travel there a few times a year both on business and pleasure.  We decided to stay at Hotel 41 as I was intrigued by its high rating, and I have stayed in one of its ""sister hotels"" in Geneva which was spectacular.  Typically I stay at the Langham due to service, rooms and location.  The pros: - small hotel with personalized highly attentive service - seems to have high staff to guest ratio - for London, the guest rooms, including the bathrooms were generous in size - the room itself had great linens, etc. - we were always greeted with a warm smile; I find that in many luxury hotels in London the staff is more sterile, even if pleasant - in advance of your stay you are sent a form so that they know how to…"
October 2019,Hotel 41 is Amazing,We stayed at Hotel 41 in October 2019 in London and it was fantastic.  The rooms and Executive Lounge are beautiful. But the best thing about Hotel 41 is the wonderful employees - they made our stay fantastic.  We asked them at the last minute to see if they could locate a wheelchair for my mom on a Sunday morning.  Initially they had no luck since all the places were either already rented out or closed since it was Sunday.  But they kept trying and the called our room  about 15 minutes later saying they had located a wheelchair at one of their sister properties and they were going to have it sent over in a taxi! This made our stay in London that much more special. We will definitely stay at Hotel 41 on our next visit to London.
October 2019,Exquisite Hotel,"This is an excellent Boutique Hotel. From the moment I was checked in until I left, everyone tried their best to make my stay memorable. I truly enjoyed my stay at Hotel 41. Magdalena at the welcome desk was very helpful and friendly. A bubbly upon check in was a nice touch.  Will I come back, you bet!"
October 2019,Best Hotel in London,"We stay at Hotel 41 every time we visit London and it's clear why the instant we enter the hotel. The service is impeccable - from the champagne arrival to the personal touches on the turndown service to the fact that every staff member knows your name. On this trip we want to personally thank Steve Jones, Alex, Mitchell, and the Night Manager Vladis who helped make this stay as incredible as every other one we've had at the hotel."
August 2019,SIMPLY THE BEST!,"The title of my review speaks for itself - Hotel 41 is Simply the Best.  Of all the places we have stayed in the world Hotel 41 still rates as the best for service, beautifully appointed rooms, very friendly staff, fantastic breakfasts, plunder-the-pantry treats and overall such a wonderful place to stay.  This is our fifth stay with Hotel 41 and every time we arrive here it is like a haven to us.  The hotel is close to Victoria Station, Buckingham Palace, the Mall and overall it is such a great place to stay and be within walking distance of a lot of attractions in London.  We must thank Magdalena once again for her thoughtfulness & kindness - she is an asset to Hotel 41. It is the small things that make a difference like acknowledging special occasions that make Hotel 41 so…"
September 2019,My Husband is Now a Believer ,"I read hundreds of Hotel 41 reviews when we were planning our London vacation. Trip Advisor has never steered us wrong...so I proposed this 5 star hotel.  My husband was reluctant. Was the expense truly worth it? It’s a fantastic area of London (quick walk to Victoria station transportation hub), but there were cheaper options. We booked and hoped it was the right decision. They won my husband over the moment we arrived.  Very tired after 10+ hours of travel - there was no long check-in line at a counter. We were escorted to a comfortable sofa and served champagne and gorgeous snacks. Paperwork was brought to us.  During our entire stay this same caring, superior service was evident. The staff are amazing and truly do treat you like royalty.  The Executive Lounge became a little…"
September 2019,THE place to stay in London,"Small, charming, friendly and just down the street from Buckingham palace. Enough free buffets that you don't need to leave the hotel for meals. Rooms are decent size for Europe and kept spotless. They will pick you up and deliver you to LHR in a most comfortable S class Mercedes for a reasonable fee."
September 2019,Best ever hotel ,"Stayed in the conservatory suite for three nights on there stay one night free offer.as has been said by so many people this place is amazing.the suite is lovely on two levels and with everything you could possibly want and luxury toiletries.you feel at home from the moment you arrive sipping complimentary champagne and snacks while the staff take the time to engage with you and get to know your likes and needs,love everything about it as it is a peaceful haven amongst the business of central London.the Leopard Bar next door is also worth a mention with a great champagne menu and a lovely female jazz singer.back to the hotel though it is so good that i have cancelled a November booking i had at another top hotel & am returning here instead.thanks for looking after my wife and i…"
September 2019,A gem.,"There are not enough superlatives to describe this gem just a few blocks from Buckingham Palace.  The room decor and attention to detail are outstanding.  Food quality and variety in the lounge is excellent.  But what really sets Hotel 41 apart is the warm personal service.  You know when hospitality staff is faking it, and they definitely are not faking it here.  The smiles are genuine and the warmth radiates from everyone.  They are like a family taking care of family.  By day 2, everyone knew our names.  This is the best hotel my wife and I have ever visited, and we will definitely be returning."
September 2019,Second time but hopefully not the last.,"I really love this hotel. I visited them for the first timed in May 2018 and also last week. This hotel really made serious damage, because when I stay at other hotels, can not help but compare. The 41 has set the benchmark very high. I was very happy to see that the same staff was present since my first visit. This alone tells me that is very likely that the staff are happy to work there and there is no personal turnover like most places. The hotel is great, the location too, but the staff it what really makes the difference. I enjoyed talking to everyone of them, part of this trips is about meeting people and see their work. I always learn a little something from everyone. That is why traveling is an enriching experience. I want to thank all of those who were involved during…"
September 2019,Superb boutique hotel,"There is a reason this has been the #1 hotel in London for so many years.  I think the staff has a lot do do with it, particularly the younger staff and the concierge help.  We enjoyed Maria and Mateo!  There was an older gentleman in charge of the afternoon lounge service that was more than a bit stuffy and just did not seen to fit in with the rest of the smiling faces that we saw there.  It is VERY quiet, rooms have great air conditioning, the bed was extremely comfortable, the breakfast buffet was excellent.  For a peaceful, high service stay I am not sure you could do much better."
September 2019,These are a few of my favourite things,I  have stayed at the Burj in Dubai & the Versace in Australia but hotels in London have been commonplace TILL NOW. Why should U stay at Hotel 41? It depends on yr priorities. If u want to beuh treated  like a queen or king & staff who are eager to indulge yr every whim come here.Let me elucidate.  My husband was seriously I'll & was only able to eat normally since March.When I told  the hotel  he loved cornbeef they incorporated it in the canapes. .U get a glass of champagne on arrival.There are canapes at 5pm  snacks available all day. A hot meal salad & dessert  in plunder the pantry from 8.30 to 1am. When our transfer failed to materialize a staff member rang the company & then went round the back to find the transfer driver asleep.  Another staff member organized our hop on…
September 2019,Husband and wife,Was absolutely fabulous. Great room decor top notch staff impeccable and food pantry fun to raid. Will return again in future location handy to central London restaurants at sister properties excellent and Gabriel made great kahlaha coffee according to wife
August 2019,It Doesn't Get Any Better Than 41,"Spent 3 nights here before a four week North Atlantic cruise.  I have stayed at a lot of hotels in my lifetime.  Without a doubt, this was the VERY BEST.  If you need a hotel in London, stay here.  Stayed at the Jefferson Hotel in Washington DC a few years ago.  That was great, 41 was way above that.  Very small hotel, everyone knows your name, not stuffy at all.  Totally excellent customer service from the entire staff.  Super clean and plenty of room in Room 1.  If I ever make it back to London, I will not have to look at any other websites, other than 41.  London was a blast, 41 was in a great location and even booked events and transportation, including picking up at LHR."
June 2019,Wonderful Hotel Amazing Staff,"Beautiful hotel, the staff is incredibly helpful- our driver the hotel arranged Eddie was amazing, he took us everywhere in the English countryside we wanted to get to and we were so comfortable in the beautiful Mercedes car we rode in, and he was very friendly."
October 2019,Best Hotel Stave Ever!,"We arrived and were greeted downstairs warmly even though we were a bit early for check in.  Everyone was so attentive, it was better than any service we have had, and we have stayed at some very nice places.  I think the small size of the hotel adds to the ambiance and the staff was absolutely amazing! My wife had a bit of a cold and they offered cough sweets/drops and brought a humidifier to the room.  The best feature of the hotel is the button on your phone which reads, ""Whatever/Whenever"".  Meaning the staff are on call for you all the time.  Great stay!"
October 2019,Hotel 41 A Step Above the Rest,It starts from the moment you walk through the doors and are greeted by the recptionist. You ae then personaly escorted to the private elevator to the 5th floor. A glass of champagne awaits you and you are given a tour of their outstanding lounge. Complimentary snacks and water are provided during the day and thoughout the day. Complimentary hot food snacks are provided during the evening. The rooms have everything you can imagine and are beautifully decorated. The staff of the entire hotel must have been trained by the best because they go way beyond in seeing that your every wish is granted. We had snacks in the Leopard Lounge and that is definitely worth a visit. Angelo does a superb job as host and server. We had the Champagne Saber Presentation and it was quite…
September 2019,The perfect Hotel,"We stayed here for one night and were treated like royalty the entire time.   The staff went beyond what is expected at even a luxury hotel like this.   The pantry is fantastic,  great selection of a variety of food.  5 star all the way. "
September 2019,Hotel 41... ..Not living up to expectations or reviews,. This hotel had been on my to do bucket list for years !The first evening we received the much reviewed Executive Lounge service with appetizers and evening canape's. We also got the tea service and were looked after there as well.    . The Executive Lounge service ended after the first evening. We got the tea again both of the other nights and our table was never cleared nor did anyone come back to our table for anything. We noticed that everyone in the lounge was offered appetizers and canape's but us. The attendant seemed to be watching us and we felt somewhat uncomfortable.  I had to go to the station and ask if I could order a champagne. When the attendant came to our table with the glass of champagne he walked off and left all the dishes which had been there over an hour…
October 2019,We didn’t want to leave,"This was our first trip to London and definitely not the last. Hotel 41 was a big part of why we enjoyed our trip so much. The service was outstanding and everyone we encountered was pleasant and professional. The hotel was spotlessly clean. We stayed in both a junior suite and an executive king suite and both were wonderful. The nights we spent at Hotel 41 were the best night’s sleep we had while on our European vacation. The hotel is quiet and posh.  The Executive Lounge was the stuff dreams are made of. Imagine the library of a very classy British millionaire, then staff it with wonderful employees and add a rotating selection of delicious complimentary foods. It was my dream and my happy place.   It is more pricey than what you could pay, but for the quality of sleep and…"
September 2019,Deserves to be #1!,"My husband an me stayed for 5 nights in the hotel and it was one the best experiences of our  lives!  The Observatory room  was the loviest with obsessive attention for details: a nice fireplace, an incredible glass roof, and amazing bathroom with the best amenities. Every night a special surprise was waiting for us on the bed (cookies, eyecream, home spray, etc) The Executive lounge was fantastic, 24 hour first class service, with elaborates Cold and Hot dishes.  And the staff was simply the best, we have no words to thank the attention of David, Magdalen, Enric and also Malcolm for all the caring.  The location is very good with tube and buses stops nearby. We’ve been in London several times, but Hotel 41 is our definitive address for now on!"
July 2019,Ridiculously impeccable,"Service, service, service.  It's like having your own apartment near Buckingham Palace.  The rooms are small, but very well-appointed, and having Stefan to greet you in the evening is like having your own personal Jeeves.  "
September 2019,"Exceeded expectations, a truly magical place to stay !","Of our entire 4 week holiday throughout the UK and France, Hotel 41 was by far our favourite place to stay. Considering this was not the most expensive of the hotels we stayed in, it far exceeded any of the others in superior service and friendliness. At all times we felt completely at home, looked after and treated to a level of thoughtfulness and personalised attention that is unfaultable. We look forward to our return to this wonderful place!"
September 2019,Exquisite hotel with outstanding service!,This was our first trip to London and we will definitely come back to stay at Hotel 41.  We were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived after an overnight flight.    Staff greet you by name and take every opportunity to make your stay unforgettable. Our room was clean and made-up every evening just like on a cruise ship.  The breakfast was amazing and the evening free canapes and sandwiches in the lounge still inspire cravings!  We loved this hotel and its great location.
September 2019,Even better than I expected!,"I’ve read a lot about this hotel and have wanted to stay for a while, It surpassed all my expectations, beautiful hotel and as all the other reviews say, first class staff. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. We loved it."
September 2019,Exception Luxury & Service,"My husband and I spent Labor Day Weekend at Hotel 41 and could not have been more pleased! Every detail was carefully orchestrated, from champagne upon arrival (or mimosas in our case as it was 8AM :-), to a luxurious pillow menu, to unique goodies left on our bed at turndown service. The staff were lovely and incredibly accommodating and we could not get enough of the lounge/pantry. As is clearly a theme throughout all reviews, the hotel prides itself on offering delicious bites and an extensive wine/cocktail list throughout the day and late into the night - which we found ourselves enjoying post midnight more than once! It was such a treat to return to the hotel and feel right at home and this speaks to the lack of pretension associated with such high standards and such well…"
August 2019,Exceptional Experience,Upon check in we were greeted with a variety of Champagnes to choose a glass from.  This set the tone for our entire stay.  Everyone there gave us spectacular service!There was fruit and chocolates in the room.  The cocktails in the afternoon were unique and delicious. The accompanying appetizers were wonderful.  This was the best service we've experienced in over 40 years of traveling!
August 2019,Best hotel experience of my life,"I stayed at Hotel 41 for four nights in August and let me tell you, Hotel 41 has it all. Perfect location, wonderful staff, great food, and the hotel itself has a luxurious vibe that makes you miss it when you’re away. And I’m accustomed to staying at 5 star locales like The Palace in St. Moritz, the Four Seasons, and the Mandarin Oriental.   I usually don’t enjoy hanging out at my hotel but the lobby is so inviting, I found myself hanging out there instead of the local restaurants or pubs. They have tasty free snacks at all hours and after 8 they have dinner (also free). When I stayed they had this delicious chicken curry that I would have gladly paid for. They also had a fantastic breakfast which was included in my stay. You can get a traditional English Breakfast that is…"
August 2019,My second stay even better than the first!,"I was here 5 years ago and wrote  glowing review. Since then it is even better! The staff is still over the top amazing! Everyone knows your name within minutes arrival! Order once and they know your coffee and wine desires and anticipate your needs.  The hotel is beautiful and QUIET! the rooms are the quietest city hotel rooms I have ever experienced. My husband had a back injury and they did everything in their power to make him more comfortable. This is the ONLY place I will ever stay in London. Wow!! For USA travelers, you can book through Costco travel and get tour credits, hotel transfers, a dinner, etc. I think next time I will book straight with the hotel. The tour company is not very good... and Uber is available from LHR now. I would avoid 'Golden Tours' Also location…"
February 2019,Best hotel in london!!,"Visited Hotel 41 in a Junior Suite for two nights in Feb and loved every single part of the stay. The pantry, attention to detail, friendly staff and general atmosphere in the hotel is unrivalled. Can’t wait to stay again!"
August 2019,Wonderful hotel and staff,"The hotel is great. Location right across from Buckingham Palace and the theater.  Underground station right nearby.  The best thing about the hotel for my wife and I was the staff!  Every single one of the staff made it their goal to make our stay the best they could!  We have never stayed in a hotel, and have traveled the world, that had staff accomplish this so successfully. Any return to London, we will be staying there. "
August 2019,Consistently Lovely!,"After many visits, I continue to be impressed by this hotel and its staff! The hotel and my room were beautiful and comfortable, as always. I also appreciate the location and how conveniently located it is to all of the attractions and locations that I love to explore. However, I call this my home away from home while in London because of the staff. They are such a welcoming, professional, and caring group. I truly appreciate being welcomed in such a warm manner during my stay. The staff goes out of their way to accommodate any requests. Maria and the team were very helpful in fulfilling a unique food request that I had and worked to figure out the best option for the food items I needed to carry with me back on my flight for a work event. They truly went above and beyond their…"
August 2019,Wonderful,"No reason to be sceptical about this Trip Advisor recommendation. Hotel 41 is every bit as nice as you would hope. The location isn't even the best part, although who could mind living meters away from The Royals. The Staff is the reason 41 gets its well-deserved rave. From the first greeting at street level, through your final farewell, the personnel know your needs, and anticipate your desires. We had a most delicious slice of chocolate cake, in recognition of our recent anniversary,  awaiting our room arrival, as well as tickets to that night's Proms at The Royal Albert Hall (all pre-arranged by The Hotel.) Our room and bath, away from the bustle below, were extremely comfortable. Our breakfast was first class. Kudos to Magdelena at Reception and Paula for their personalized…"
July 2019,My all-time favorite hotel,"I’d been fortunate enough to stay at Hotel 41 15 years ago on a mother-daughter trip with my 23 year old daughter. I knew if I ever returned to London, I’d be staying at 41. My husband and I visited in early July, 2019 and both loved every minute. The staff become like friends if you choose to spend time with them. We did. We enjoyed breakfasts, afternoon tea, drinks on the rooftop and plundering the pantry and many a fascinating conversation. Although all the staff was terrific, we especially want to mention Stefan, Osi, David and Mitch.  Our room was so comfortable and chic. I did not want to leave. Don’t walk, run to this hotel. "
August 2019,Wow!  This is the place to stay!,"From the moment you walk into Hotel 41 you will be impressed.  The decor, service and accommodations will not disappoint.  With only 28 rooms you feel like you are in your own private club.  This was one of the highlights of my trip."
July 2019,An absolute gem...,"I cannot think of enough superlatives to describe this absolute gem but I will try.  First of all the location is fantastic.  You are literally around the corner from Buckingham Palace in one direction and Victoria Station in the other.  The gorgeous St. James Park is right down the road.  The hotel staff couldn't have been more lovely or welcoming from the moment we stepped through the door.  All rooms as well as the Executive Lounge are on the 5th floor.  The Executive Lounge is basically where everything takes place--reception, breakfast, afternoon tea and evening snacks.  The lounge must be experienced to believe it.  The food is delectable.  Afternoon tea is so enjoyable and eloquent.  After a long day of touring, you must stop into the lounge for the most delightful…"
July 2019,The Best.Period.,"This was absolutely the best hotel we have ever stayed at EVER. We have stayed at Four Season properties, Mandarin Orientals, etc so we know 5 star, and Hotel 41 is on another stratosphere from even those brands and experiences. There is no where else I would stay if I was in London again.  The layout of the property very much lends itself to a VIP feel. The entrance is an unassuming set of double doors next to the more obvious hotel entrance to the Rubens property. You can really only tell you’re at Hotel 41 from its banner flying above and it requires a hotel key card to even access the building. Once inside, you are whisked up to the fifth floor. The entire boutique hotel takes up only this floor so its very easy to navigate and also very intimate.   The lobby and restaurant…"
July 2019,Best Hotel Ever,We have never experienced this level of service and attention. It is quite an extraordinary hotel and we loved everything about it. We had a really hard time getting motivated to get out and explore London because we just wanted to stay at the hotel and enjoy the pampering.
July 2019,A truly memorable stay!!!!!,"Having never been to London, my wife and I embarked on a search for the perfect place to stay to enable us to best enjoy our trip, During a search of places to stay we discovered Hotel 41, which claimed to be a small boutique hotel centrally located in close proximity to Buckingham Palace. It truly did not disappoint in any way. I had let the hotel know that we were celebrating our anniversary. Well, upon our arrival, the room which was beautifully appointed in all respects had a large bed pillow reading Happy Anniversary, a large bouquet of flowers and a delicious cake - none of which was expected.  The room and the entire hotel were spotless throughout our stay. However, I have missed the best part. and it is the staff. They were each extraordinarily friendly, helpful,…"
July 2019,Fabulous hotel and fabulous staff,"We chose this hotel because of the good reviews and we were not disappointed. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, we were made to feel special. The staff was very attentive, friendly and professional at all times. We were upgraded to the Balmoral suite which was very nice as there was 2 bathrooms for 3 of us. The executive lounge was nice and so was the rooftop. Special thanks to Dean, Jean Nicolas, Patricia (the lady at breakfast) and John who welcomed us with a nice glass of champagne for looking after us so well. From now on, hotel 41 will be our hotel of choice for our week ends in London"
July 2019,"Great Service, Superb Staff","Great intimate boutique hotel well located, rooms and decor lovely and quiet, the beds super comfortable everything luxurious. The service and staff are exceptional and meticulous, helpful in every way possible. A rare find!!"
August 2018,Wonderful property!!,"One of my all time favorite hotels. This is a small boutique hotel not far from Victoria Station.  I stayed in the Conservatory suite and it was magnificent! There is a sitting room downstairs with bathroom.  Upstairs over the bed is a glass ceiling - you can remotely open the blinds so that you can see the sky. Beautiful!!!  There is also a double jacuzzi tub upstairs in the large master bath.  The service at the hotel is amazing - they make you feel so welcome and tend to your every need.  There is a great breakfast spread - also food served throughout the day and a ""raid the pantry"" option for late night.   Simply delightful!!!"
July 2019,Wonderful,"We stayed at Hotel 41 to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary. It was a fantastic experience which exceeded our already high expectations. Nothing was too much trouble for the excellent team who made us feel so welcome. Located in the heart of Victoria, this guest only hotel has the feel of an exclusive club with attentive service to match. If you are celebrating a special occasion or looking for something a little different then we would throughly recommend this gem of a hotel."
July 2019,Unbeatable Charm with Great Service!,"This is a boutique, boutique hotel.   Hotel 41 has 28 rooms and occupies a single floor. Talk about intimate! In typical European fashion, the rooms are on the smaller size. However, the decor and attention to scale allows me to confidently call the rooms “charming” or “romantic”; take your pick.  While the hotel is small, it’s service stature is tremendous. They anticipate your needs which makes the experience stand out. The entire staff quickly knows you by name and are at the ready to assist with any request large or small. A package delivered to the hotel days in advance was in our room upon arrival. I casually mentioned having the fireplace lit and it was roaring upon our return from dinner. While checking out at 7:30a we mentioned we were heading to the airport. The staff…"
March 2019,This is my bench mark hotel!,"My daughter and I spent a week here. The service was truly outstanding, as was our room. The staff was attentive and remembered our orders for breakfast after the second morning. The treats left for us with our turn down service were always delightful - sometimes fresh fruit and other times a sample size of one of their branded beauty products.  The day we saw Hamilton, our treat was fresh fruit and macaroons bearing the Hamilton logo.  "
August 2019,Fabulous experience overall- Staff was amazing and Location was perfect,"From the moment we arrived we were treated  like valued guests. The location is ideal... walking distance to everything we wanted to do and the staff were amazing, gracious and professional. We will definitely return . A special thank you to Stefan- we look forward to seeing you again soon"
April 2019,Incredible customer service,"This boutique luxury hotel is uniquely situated on the 5th floor of an older building across the street from Buckingham palace.  The staff welcomes guests with champagne at check-in.  We celebrated our 25th anniversary during our stay, and were surprised to find a cake in our room for the occasion.  The hotel recommendation of Rules restaurant for our anniversary dinner was perfect.  You can’t beat the personal service you receive at Hotel 41."
July 2019,Perfect place to stay in London,"We were fortunate to celebrate our 40th Anniversary at Hotel 41, and it was worthy of the occasion; from the nicely appointed room, to the attentive staff at every turn, and finally to the wonderful breakfasts, tea, and evening spreads, it is a hotel unmatched in our lifetimes. Especially enjoyed the interactions with Steve and Stefan, who made us feel like family and not guests. The hotel is located in a great part of London, with easy access to most of the city's attractions, but really, why would you want to leave? We will be back!"
July 2019,Simply Wonderful,"We wanted somewhere special for our wedding night, the photos and reviews were so good we treated ourselves for our special day, albeit booking a regular room. From the second we arrived, we were treated like royalty, from the doorman taking our bags, to the complimentary champagne when signing in and for every single moment during our stay, every single member of staff very politely greeted us by name. Arriving at our room we were told that they had upgraded our room to the Conservatory suite, which was beyond our wildest dreams, it was utterly perfect, down to every tiny detail.  We had dinner in the English grill (again with a complimentary bottle of champagne) which was delightful.   Finally returning to our room, to be greeted with scattered rose petals, candles, soft music…"
September 2018,If You Like Horses and Alice in Wonderland,"This private hotel is pricy but worth it.  When we first arrived,,, kind of strange, the lobby decor reminded me of Alice in Wonderland. Got lost several times trying to find our room, the hallways being narrow, color scheme, felt like a maze, hard to explain, but cool.  It's not your ordinary hotel, that's for sure but lots of amenities. The top floor restaurant with a big skylight is always open for free snacks and deserts. You must pay for meals and room service but the staff is terrific and goes the extra mile. We stayed in a couple of their rooms, very cozy and warm decor. If you can stay on the top floor, I'd advise that as you can hear the cleaning of the rooms and walking back and forth, building structure is old.  Now, to the horses. Right across the street is the Royal…"
July 2019,Wonderful stay at our new favorite hotel!,"Have to admit that we were a little skeptical about whether Hotel 41 could live up to all the great Trip Advisor reviews, but it so deserves them!  First of all, the service was absolutely outstanding- usually you might note one or two people that stand out, but in this case every single staff person we interacted with made us feel welcome and like valued guests. The hotel is small, only about 30 rooms, so it has the wonderful feel of an intimate, luxurious inn, but it has all the amenities of a full size luxury hotel (in part due to it connecting through a discrete door in the lobby to a sister larger hotel property-The Rubens at the Palace-next door). In terms of the room, we booked the only room that was available at the time, an Executive King Room, and were pleasantly…"
July 2019,An absolute gem!,"I have been going on an annual trip with five of my high school buddies for more than 30 years now.  Typically, we stay at the club level at Ritz-Carlton hotels or at the closest thing we can find to that level of service. This year was our first foray to Europe.  My neighbor and travel agent recommended that we stay at Hotel 41 in London.  He has created a bit of a problem for himself, however, as I don't see how he can top Hotel 41.  What a hidden gem.  The executive lounge is exactly the set-up that we love, a warm and welcoming gathering place for us to hang out in between the day's activities.  The rooms were superb.  But most importantly, the staff was amazing.   Stefan, Patricia and Magdalena in particular were so warm, welcoming and personable that they became an…"
July 2019,Double visit!,"My favourite hotel in London and I got to visit it twice in a month. My husband and I enjoyed a fabulous weekend in June when we were so excited to see the beautifully refurbished roof terrace. A beautiful sunny day in a beautiful spot.   A few weeks later, I returned to 41 to meet up with my cousin and goddaughter who were over from the US. We started on the roof, where Stefan allowed Meaghan, my goddaughter, to perform the sabrage - opening our champagne bottle with a sabre. A really special ambition fulfilled.  We then went back downstairs for a delicious afternoon tea where both Stefan and Steve looked after us so well.  Thank you to Lauren for making all the arrangements and for making both occasions so memorable. The team at 41 are unique!"
July 2019,The best Boutique Hotel in London,"I’ve been staying in London hotels for the last 14 years and have never experienced such fantastic staff and service. The hotel itself is gorgeous and the location perfect for all the best London attractions but what stood out for me was the attention to detail and individual attention this hotel offers. It’s an absolute gem and would give it 6 stars if I could.  Thank you for a brilliant stay. Kate, Meg and 🐶"
July 2019,Par Excellence ,"      I can’t believe that it had been 15 yrs since we last stayed at this wonderful hotel. What a mistake and from now on, it will be our London home whenever we visit. The hotel is in a perfect location adjacent to Buckingham Palace so it is centrally located to many of the London districts. Boutique in style, this hotel is very classy, very comfortable. The rooms are extremely comfortable and fully appointed. You will not want for anything and if you happen to require anything else there is always the “whatever, whenever” hotline. The service at this hotel really is unparalleled and they always make one feel so welcomed and taken care of. The library which also serves as the lounge and breakfast area (and the breakfasts are delicious )is comfortable and serves all the snacks…"
May 2019,One of the Best Hotels I've Ever Visited,"I'll just keep to bullet points to avoid rambling about this terrific hotel. - We booked the Junior suite and it looked even nicer in person and had so much more amenities in the room than a person would ever expect. My husband thought it was funny that I got excited over all the small things they thought of to provide for people. For example; They have a ""pillow"" menu with 10 options for pillows if you prefer something different than than the standard pillows on the bed (see my photos) - You are greeted in their main reception room upon arrival with a champagne cart to greet you with a glass of champagne while they check you into the hotel - Customer service is phenomenal, and everyone was genuinely nice and eager to help with anything you could want or need - Every evening…"
June 2019,Returning again to Hotel 41,Third trip to London for the celebration of Queen's birthday and always enjoy staying at 41.  Watching the fly-over up on the roof with a glass of champagne is always a thrill. The staff is more than friendly and courteous. They are outstanding in every way
June 2019,Our new home away from home in London!,"We capped off a 10 day European trip with a stay at Hotel 41 on our 25th wedding anniversary. The trip included stays at 5* properties, but Hotel 41 was the best of the best.  This is a very boutique hotel right in the heart of London, about a 5 minute walk from Buckingham palace. Having stayed in other areas- we both agreed that this central location was ideal for touring the city.  The room was gorgeous- well appointed with luxury amenities throughout.   The service was Four Seasons level-exceptional from beginning to end. This is a very special property.  Staying at Hotel 41 gave us the most memorable anniversary. We have found our new home away from home in London!"
June 2019,Checked Every Box,Unrivaled service in every way. Excellent location and adapts to all needs. Professionalism in all areas of guest service and in the one issue we had was met with immediate response. Highest regard for all areas of our holiday.
May 2019,"Stay Here....No, Really, Stay Here.","What a wonderful find! Hotel 41 is located on Buckingham Palace Road, a 5-minute walk from Victoria Station, and perhaps a 10-minute walk from the Palace.   It is the hotel that thought of things you didn't know you needed. After a very long flight from the USA, we were greeted with a glass of champagne in the truly lovely restaurant / bar area of the hotel. The hotel has only 22 rooms, and we almost never saw any other guest even though we stayed there for 10 nights. The hotel is nearly silent, which is incredible, given its location.   It is quite deluxe without ever feeling stuffy. The room was wonderful. Every night our bed was turned down, and we arrived to soft music, candlelight , his-and-hers slippers by the bed and snacks provided. The showers are like standing under a…"
May 2019,Simply perfect,"I stayed with my husband and we chose this hotel for its location, as we were invited to a Buckingham Palace Garden Party. Generally we visit London to go to the Theatre and there are any number of 5 star hotels more conveniently located for the Theatre District. We have, in recent years - and to make my point - for example, stayed at The Savoy, Claridges and The Soho. When we stay in London (or anywhere without our children!) we spoil ourselves. Well, that isn’t going to matter any more. Whether we walk or take a taxi, if No 41 has availability it is where we will be staying on future London visits.  The service was exceptional. The facilities impeccable. Everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel, but so much more.  I am only putting this review up because the staff…"
May 2019,Exceptional Customer Service and Beautiful Property,"From the moment you arrive to the moment you depart, Hotel 41 is an exceptional hotel that exceeds all expectations. Upon arrival, you are greeted with a glass of champagne. Throughout the visit, you experience unexpected touches like turning the TV on to a station that featured relaxing music.   We didn't take advantage of tea-time, but we did enjoy the executive dining room. The breakfast experience was exceptional. Food is prepared well, but the service is what wows you.  The executive dining room stays open until 1 a.m. - we enjoyed some late night cocktails and paired them with the food that was available.   The staff is friendly and helpful and their mission appears to be that they want each customer to have an exceptional experience.  I am so happy that we stayed at this…"
May 2019,Extraordinary Experience,"Hotel 41 was fantastic from the moment we arrived. We received personalized service and top notch accommodations. From champagne on arrival, to afternoon tea, to hand delivered custom soap - Hotel 41 is a superb experience all around. We will absolutely return when in London."
May 2019,"Fantastic Staff, Location, Everything!","We've just returned from a whirlwind family trip to London and Scotland.  As is usual, I relied on TripAdvisor for help in choosing the right accommodations, tours etc.  41 Hotel did not disappoint.  We were traveling with 5 adults and 6 young children.  After a 10 hour flight, it was lovely to be greeted with smiles and champagne at the 41.  We were there for 4 nights and were treated fantastically.  All the staff went out of their way to accommodate any need.  They treated our children with kindness and we felt like family by the time we departed.  The luxury was fantastic, purge the pantry welcome, and the staff unsurpassed."
May 2019,First class all the way,"Hands down the best hotel experience I have ever had. The staff are so personable, attentive and helpful. The room was lovely, clean and extremely comfortable. It’s the little details that go a long way- champagne on arrival, chocolates in the room, welcome cards, loofahs in the bathroom, his/hers bath slippers and I could go on... the plunder buffet in the executive club is such a great treat at the end of a long day. Will never stay anywhere else when visiting London!!"
August 2018,Amazing place,"A different world from a regular luxury hotel stay. Enjoyed everything from the greeting at the door, the champagne at check in and raiding the pantry. It was so lovely to sit in the lounge and chat and it felt so comfortable that we sometimes forgot we were at a hotel. Breakfast was delicious and atmosphere relaxed but still felt luxurious. I want to stay here every time I go to London. Two nights but felt like we had a long holiday. Loved the chance to raid the pantry, no low blood sugar rage in sight before dinner. Great when we have had dinner and a show and you have craving for a small snack before bed."
July 2019,A London Gem! ,"As regulars of the Oyster Box in South Africa, we were so happy to be staying at Hotel 41 which is a sister hotel. The hotel is so well located and in the heart of London but the shining light was the incredible service throughout our stay. We felt at home and so well looked after. The breakfast was delicious and the never ending snacks table was amazing. I would go back in a heartbeat! "
July 2019,Outstanding visit to Hotel 41,I took my wife to 41 and it exceeded our expectations as a luxurious hotel whom would do anything to ensure your stay is out of this world!! 5 star throughout from food to the room.... Please visit....
July 2019,Celebration,"We couldn't have asked for more to help us celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. Stefan & all the staff took every opportunity to make our stay a wonderful experience.  A beautiful, central hotel with fabulous staff. Every possible opportunity was taken to exceed our expectations! Thank you. "
July 2019,Amazing hotel,The attention to detail in this hotel  is superb. The roof top bar has a lovely view over the Royal Mews. Staff very friendly and they couldn't do enough for you. The food was excellently prepared and presented and tasted delicious. There is nothing about this hotel that we could fault. We were only there for one night as we were travelling on the Orient Express to Venice the following day. Chose this hotel as we thought it was in keeping with the rest of our trip and it certainly was. We would definitelyreturn.
July 2019,Everything a hotel should be..,"Having stayed for both business and pleasure now, I can honestly say this is my favourite hotel anywhere in the world. Whilst the decor, layout and style are exemplary, the service is better still, faultless.   Reviewers far more eloquent than I have waxed lyrical about how wonderful this place is, all I'll add is that none of them do it justice, you simply have to stay here."
July 2019,A little 5* star gem in the heart of London,"We booked Hotel 41 after reading the reviews online and hearing from some friends how amazing this place was and what can I say, it excelled in every possible way! From the moment we arrived and checked in to the moment we left the staff were so polite and attentive, nothing was too much trouble. We couldn’t fault anyone but I must say a big thank you to Stefan who made us feel so welcome. The rooftop bar was another added touch we didn’t expect but just made it that much more special. The best thing about Hotel 41 is the size, it’s such a personal hotel and everything is done to such a high standard. Best hotel I have ever stayed at and will 100% be returning. Thank you everyone at Hotel 41!!!"
July 2019,London Series 2019,"Beautiful quaint boutique hotel near Victoria Station. Exceptional staff and service. If the weather is nice check out out the roof top bar. Very British!!! We loved it.  Pleasantly surprised to find out it belongs to same hotel group as Ashford Castle (Red Carnation Hotel Collection), in Ireland. Look forward to the opportunity to see more of their properties..."
June 2019,"3rd visit, still excellent","We stayed here for one night as part of my wife's birthday celebrations, and it was as excellent as our previous two visits. As always, the staff are incredibly helpful before arrival in checking if anything is required (in our case, a little something I arranged which was exactly as I hoped it would be) and during one's stay. Our suite was excellent and exactly as we remembered it from a previous visit.  This hotel continues to be the height of luxury - expensive but worth it for the service."
July 2019,Amazing hotel,"Only had a one night stay but wished it had been longer. The hotel is only small but very beautiful. The staff are beyond exceptional,  you feel completely spoilt from the minute you walk through the door. A complementary glass of champagne on check in was lovely. I had mentioned it was my husbands birthday and when we were shown to.our room we had been upgraded to one of their suites overlooking the Palace mews!! The staff are so attentive addressing you personally by name whenever they see you....they make this hotel very special. They offer complementary canapes, snacks and 'plunder the pantry'...which was great after coming back from a show to a hot pie!!!"
April 2019,Loved it again,"I feel like we have definitely found our London Hotel, maybe because it wasn't our first visit it didn't feel as special, but that is really trying to find something negative to say.  It was great again, the rooms are comfortable and quiet, almost hard to believe that you are basically in the center of a large City.  The location is fantastic."
May 2019,A hidden gem,We have just returned from the most amazing stay at hotel 41.   My husband booked the hotel for a treat for our first wedding anniversary. If I’m honest I didn’t know the hotel existed but what a hidden gem!  The hotel is located on the fifth floor as it’s sister hotel next door accommodates the other 4 floors.   The theme of the decor throughout is black and white and is simply beautiful.  On arrival we was greeted with a glass of champagne and was advised we had been upgraded as it was our anniversary. Rather than a executive king room we was staying in the junior suite. What a treat!   The suite was amazing. Where do I start - we was most certainly home from home. Everything you need is available. 3 TVs to choose from with separate sky TV. A beautiful bedroom with a huge bed…
May 2019,Faling ill wasn't the plan but........,"Regular guests at 41, we arrived mid-morning and almost immediately after our welcome glass of champagne, left for a day out with friends.  Early to bed, we succumbed to a virus going around our grandchildren's school and spent a difficult night.  The next morning we informed Lauren, the Resident Manager, who despite having a fully hotel, managed to arrange for us to stay in our room for a second, unplanned night.  There was no way we could have dressed and packed, never mind changed rooms. During that day and evening, the staff could not have been more helpful and understanding, going out to collect medication, offering appropriate light meals and beverages and bringing endless supplies of water, etc whilst respecting our necessary privacy.  Falling ill away from home is always…"
May 2019,Best hotel experience of my life,"We treated ourselves to a night at Hotel 41 as we began our honeymoon so were flying from Heathrow the following day and wanted to start off on the right note. Boy were we not disappointed!  On arrival we were congratulated on our wedding and told we were being upgraded to the conservatory suite. We had booked one of their ""standard"" rooms (although nothing in this place can be called standard). The conservatory suite was OUT OF THIS WORLD. A king-size bed, a separate seating area, a jacuzzi bathtub, 3 TV's (one in the bathroom!) and best of all, a retractable canopy over the bed uncovering the conservatory roof so we could sleep under the stars (well, what stars you could see... this is London after all!)  But I'm getting ahead of myself. The hotel entrance is quite small and…"
May 2019,1st class,My wife and I spent 16 nights total in England and Scottland. We spent 2 nights at Hotel 41. The accomidations and service was 1st class. I would consider this hotel the best of the 7 hotels during our stay in the UK. The staff was very attentive and extremely friendly. Our two breakfasts and one late lunch were delicious. We stayed in the Balmoral Suite which was very spacious and well appointed.  The hotel had a special birthday cake under a glass dome along with an assortment of freshly baked chocolates waiting for us in the room. Thanks Gary 
May 2019,Loved it!,"I had an amazing three night stay (if way too brief!) Completely understand why this boutique hotel is rated so highly. From the luxurious, stylish and comfortable room to the lounge and pantry and the excellent attention to detail from staff, Hotel 41 is an oasis of calm and comfort centred in the heart of London."
May 2019,Still the Best!,"Another wonderful stay at 41! The personal service is attentive and everyone makes you feel extra special and addresses you by name. This time we chose s smaller executive room, which was very cozy, very nicely decorated and well furnished.  Can't beat the location close to Buckingham Palace, the Royal Mews, the Queens's Gallery, and St. James park. Great to relax in the executive lounge with champagne upon check-in, with drinks before dinner, after the theatre for something to eat from the pantry before retiring to bed and last but not least, for their elegantly presented breakfast. As Stefan recommends the Eggs Benedict, he describes it as the ""breakfast of champions"".  Our trip was cut short due to a family emergency but we look forward to returning, when we can stay longer…"
May 2019,A Wonderful Experience ,"It was a fantastic stay. The staff are attentive, friendly and welcoming. the afternoon tea is wonderful and the pantry is a brilliant feature. After coming back from a night out it was great to raid the pantry and have a nightcap. I have been fortunate and lucky to have stayed in many premium hotels all over the world and this was by far the best for me."
May 2019,Hotel 41 delivered the holiday of a lifetime!,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for 8 nights at the beginning of May for a birthday/ anniversary trip.  Hotel 41 is that calm sanctuary that keeps you refreshed and ready to face your day with energy and excitement. All this with true welcome for their city of London. This trip was a year in the making, and I had decided on Hotel 41 early on. About a week before our arrival, I began to get nervous and thought my expectations were too high for Hotel 41. I worried for nothing! They delivered an amazing holiday experience. Hotel 41 goes above and beyond in the service experience. It is as if they wish to provide you with lifetime memories.  For example, one night while chatting with Oris (name hopefully spelled correctly) we mentioned our potential plans for the next day and…"
May 2019,Our #1 hotel choice for London,"I've been to London numerous times, and had been lucky enough to stay in other 5 star places. Although the other hotels have better amenities (bigger bathrooms, etc), they really are outdone by the SERVICE provided by the Hotel 41 staff (not to mention that free pantry!!!). We didn't have to sign for anything (the staff makes sure they know YOU right from the get go), and any concerns are addressed immediately.  And the location is superb - right in front of the Buckingham Palace, 2 blocks from Victoria underground and the Big Bus stop right in front of the hotel.   And yes it's pricey, but you definitely get the value for your money. We will definitely stay here again when we go back to London town!!!"
January 2019,"Like staying with family, if your family is really wealthy","I'm not trying to be sarcastic. The staff was so attentive and so friendly it was like having family in London. The room we stayed in was decent sized, not one of the suites, but it had enough room for two sisters with a lot of luggage (we arrived after a cruise.) The amenities were fabulous and the location can't be beat. When we needed detailed directions (well, I did since I get lost easily and was trying to get to a pharmacy by myself) one of them even took me most of the way to my destination (by foot) and recommended places for me to shop while I was out and about. I wish I could afford to stay there again, especially during a warmer and drier season. But the hot cocoa in the lobby was always welcome and the blankets were warm and cozy."
February 2019,The best hotel i have visited so far,"my apartment had a prob so i have to move some where this hotel is near my location so i choose it but really i was surprised so clean ,the welcome service was awesome ,rooms were clean .Even the food was good i have ordered the food two times and dint find any difficulty in taste and freshness ."
May 2019,The best,"Never fails to be the best in London, our home from home. Great location and rooms but the most important aspect of our stay has been the service. Everyone at 41 is friendly, cheerful willing to help in any way. We can't fault them. We love our stays at 41, a wonderful hotel to see London or just relax. We cannot rate it highly enough."
May 2019,Hated to leave...,"I spent four days and three nights in this lovely hotel with a small group of friends.  Everything about the experience was exquisite.  Of course, the rooms were clean and comfortable.  The decor aesthetic is charming. The location is fantastic.  The staff was friendly and helpful throughout.     But the star of the show for us was the executive lounge experience.  It offers excellent food and drink and a comfortable space to spend down time when not our touring London.  Meetup for a nice breakfast or coffee to start your day.  Meetup for cocktail hour before heading out to dinner.  Stop by after dinner for card games or drinks by the fireplace.  We did all three...more than once.  It delivers a quaint, social, relaxing experience with exemplary quality of service and attention.…"
May 2019,Utterly Flawless!,"Personalized and welcoming service like I have never seen before. From the moment we pulled up outside to our departure, the staff was professional, enthusiastic, and personable.   Excellent food and beverage selection for such a small hotel, from our 6:30 AM breakfast to our post-theater dinner at 11:30 PM.  And with not much between the hotel and Buckingham Palace aside from a single road, the location cannot be surpassed.  Away from the tourists and late night sports car drag races on the north end of the park, you feel peacefully at home in the middle of everything!  I look forward to my next trip to London as I will certainly be staying at this hotel again!"
April 2019,Exquisite Gem In The Heart Of London,"The 41 is not an inexpensive hotel but neither is it hotel experience that you will soon forget. Located directly across the street from the Royal Mews on Buckingham Palace Road, it's centrality to London is compelling. The hotel is also less than 500 meters from the Victoria Underground station and a shopping/restaurant complex. Convenience is definitely a plus.  In terms of service, quite simply you will not find better service anywhere. Every member of the staff will know your name and greet you warmly. Your every need will be anticipated and attended to.  Within the lounge, every member of the staff will remember your favorite cocktail and will prepare it exquisitely.   I cannot recommend a hotel more highly than the 41."
April 2019,Rather pricey but well worth it.,"Wonderful location, atmosphere and staff. Close to Victoria Station, Hyde Park, St. James Park and within waling distance of theater district. Executive lounge at 41 was superb. Great complimentary snacks and drinks served in afternoon and evening. Leopard bar had nice easy listening live music from 6-10 in evening."
April 2019,We absolutely loved it,It was a wonderful stay. The stuff was great and we did notice the little things - from having water available everywhere in the hotel (starting at breakfast continuing at reception and in the rooms) to the little gifts  at turn down service rolling up the usb cable and fixing it with a velcro  band. Another highlight was the birthday cake for our daughter.
April 2019,London Exploring,"We checked into Hotel 41 and had an incredible time. The Hotel is a real hidden gem which we spoke about long after leaving. It is quiet, intimate and the staff are just lovely. We will definately recommend to friends and family."
April 2019,Europe Holiday,Hotel41 would have to be one of the best hotels we have stayed in while traveling around the world.  The staff should be commended for the impeccable service to the guests of the hotel. The rooms and ambience of the hotel make it feel like home.
June 2019,The Reason 41 is #1 - Best Staff Ever,"Well, there are actually more reasons, but the friendliness, attentiveness and professionalism of the staff is the most important reason. From your first contact with them, they make you feel welcomed and cared for.    Another significant reason that we loved the hotel is its intimacy – we were greeted by name by every staff member we had contact with, throughout our visit. Because of the intimacy, you get to know the staff and your fellow guests.  Every room is on the fifth floor of its sister hotel, the Rubens. You enter through a separate entrance, which always has someone at the desk ready to help, and you take the elevator up. They have a stunning and cozy executive lounge which is available only to the few guests of 41, and is open 24/7. It feels like an old-fashioned…"
June 2019,nice,“A great selection for a continental breakfast; more than I have experienced in other establishments. A very quiet room with a large and comfy bed. Lovely shower. Helpful and kind staff. Very good value for money.”
June 2019,Amazing hotel!,"I had high expectations for this hotel given the great reviews I read before travelling.  Here are the highlights of our 6-night stay: - lots of thick, high quality towels, excellent water pressure and terrific toiletries in the bathroom - friendly, approachable and helpful staff - excellent food and service at breakfast - the most amazing bed I've ever slept in (at the end of our stay I had to ask the brand; it's a Savoy) - very clean and pristine condition common areas and room - check-in and check-out were extremely efficient (check-in was accompanied by a glass of champagne) We also had the afternoon tea at the hotel one afternoon.  It was a wonderful; lovely sandwiches, scones and pastries accompanied by a wide selection of teas."
June 2019,Very British Hotel with Personalized Service,This is indeed a top class hotel with top level service! The lounge and the food were also amazing. We had a wonderful stay for our girl’s birthday celebration! Thanks all the friendly staff in hotel 41 and we strongly recommend this hotel!!
June 2019,Amazing Hotel and Amazing staff and fabulous location,We stayed at this beautiful hotel just over a week ago. I read all the write ups on tripadvisor and thought can it be this good ! Well it was and more !!  all staff from front desk on antry to check in to welcome drink  - everything. Room was amazing Staff super super friendly and helpful.Too many names to mention and dont want to miss anyone out.  I think we spoke to most of them at some time during our 24 hour stay.We will be going back for sure Would highly recommend.
June 2019,Deserves 6 out of 5,"Hotel 41 continues to be our most favorite place to stay in London.  It takes service and quality to the highest level and never disappoints.  This time it was a 2 night stay for a trip to Royal Ascot and we were given an upgrade to a room on 2 levels which was very charming and very comfortable.  As always we received the lovely warm welcome and champagne from Steve, who also gave us an excellent recommendation for dinner near Sloane Square.  The library lounge remains as comfortable as ever and the generous buffet bar was loaded up once again with lots of goodies.  But, the main stand out is always the staff.  Genuinely friendly, helpful and attentive but never intrusive.  Simply brilliant.  We just love it here.  See you again soon 👍"
June 2019,Feels like an English Country Home with an excellent Staff in the heart of London,"Hotel 41 is a hidden gem with only 30 rooms, it' s as if you have your own private home with an attentive staff. The location is directly across from the Buckingham Palace's Royal Mews where the Queen keeps her horses. An easy walk to see the changing of the Palace Guard and stroll through St James Park. Victoria Station tube is close by and it's also easy walking to many of London's best sites. It's intimate, personal, sophisticated yet cozy and comfortable."
June 2019,Wonderful service,Lovely boutique hotel and a great location for visiting Buckingham Palace. The service was perfect. Everyone knew our name and bent over backward for any request. It is a very small hotel and though beautifully appointed our room was small too. I would say the hotel was a little too sedate for my thirty something daughter. I thoroughly enjoyed it however.
June 2019,Fantastic Hotel ,This hotel is a different gravy ! I can see why it is rated number 1 hotel on trip advisor. Staff are exceptional and customer service is flawless. Free upgrade on arrival to a suite and the pantry in the lounge is a very unique idea.  We will be back  
June 2019,The best there is!!!! ,What an incredible hotel. The level of service is the best I have ever encountered. And the concept of the all-day pantry is a wonderful touch. Beautifully decorated rooms. The “whatever whenever” button on the phone is a piece of brilliance.  Bravo to all the staff for making this hotel stand head and shoulders above the rest.  
April 2019,Perfect,"What is there to say that hasnt been said before? The room was lovely, but the greatest part of this hotel is the atmosphere and experience. Everyone goes out of their way to make your stay memorable. Every detail is seen to and everyone makes you feel at home. We will never stay anywhere else in London. Dean and Orsi were particularly wonderful!"
April 2019,Our new favorite London hotel,"We just loved this hotel. From the moment we arrived, greeted with champagne and the personal attention that only a high-end boutique hotel can offer, we felt like part of the family. A posh family with a gorgeous home in a beautiful part of London.   Our room was quirky, with a sitting area downstairs and the bedroom upstairs, which added to the charm. I took a bubble bath with the champagne from the check-in to recover from our long flight and the tub filled in about two seconds flat. After that, things only got better. Because this was once a private home, when we went into the lounge it felt like gathering in the sitting room, but with a healthy supply of delicious appetizers, like salmon with dill and beet puree on toast, and a wide variety of drinks, and our new friend…"
April 2019,Happy Guests,"We enjoyed our stay at Hotel 41. It’s a small  boutique hotel but you will be impressed by the quality and flawless service provided by their staff. They were warm, friendly, and always willing to tend to your needs without being overbearing. Full breakfast, tea service and snacks were delicious. We will definitely return.  "
April 2019,Special birthday night away,"We took our parents away to celebrate an 81st birthday. What a fantastic present. Hotel 41 was incredible from the moment we arrived. They gave us all champagne on arrival and all the staff were so friendly and welcoming. Our rooms were beautiful and it was lovely to receive a birthday cake and bottle of champagne which we enjoyed later in the day. The hotel arranged tickets to the Churchill war rooms so that we did not have to queue. When we returned in the evening we plundered the pantry! Fantastic food, snacks, ice creams and drinks.  The staff arranged taxis for us the following day to visit various sights in London. Nothing was ever too much trouble for them. This is our absolute favourite hotel and the third time we have stayed there. We will definitely be returning.…"
April 2019,A Special Place,"I decided to try a new Hotel in London on this trip, and was richly rewarded. 41 is a small, boutique hotel with an amazing staff. It’s just one floor with a small exclusive entrance in the heart of London. On the 5th floor near our room is the Executive Club. There the staff takes care of your every need from great food to packing your luggage if you like. I truly felt like I was at a beautiful home with the finest furnishings and an old world London feel. The staff make it a truly special place. If you want and authentic, throwback place in London that feels like home, 41 can not be beat!"
April 2019,A wonderful stay,"We had high expectations given all the great reviews we had read before we booked, but Hotel 41 more than lived up to them.  We were given a really warm welcome when we arrived and everything was done in a very personalised way.  The rooms were lovely and well equipped with everything you might need, not huge but really cosy and beautifully decorated.  The sitting room/bar area was very comfortable and had a lovely relaxed ambience and all the staff we interacted with were both professional and warm.  We've stayed in many hotels but Hotel 41 has created something very special indeed."
April 2019,A Stay to Remember,"We were fortunate to stay here for a second time and it did not disappoint, in fact was better than he first time, with our room being 'in the sky' with its glass dome roof. From the moment you arrive, until your final departure, every detail is catered for and nothing is too much trouble. The breakfast was as you would expect, with the choice and food quality. We plundered the pantry one night after a theatre visit and as they knew we were celebrating a birthday and a wedding anniversary, we were provided with a cake in our room. We will be back! "
May 2018,Star struck,"Invited to stay by a friend, I could not even get entry to my room with out reassurance from them with my credit card, it didn't even have enough credit to insure me going in! Was it worth it? I have no idea what it cost, but the centrality of the location was fabulous, the afternoon tea was just darling, and the staff attention unparalleled, plus my room, oh my."
April 2019,Outstanding property with superb service!,"There’s a reason Hotel 41 is rated #1 in the U.K. From its location, to amenities, staffing quality and decor, it’s simply the finest hotel I’ve patronized in Britain.   Upon arrival, you’ll be pleasantly surprised at how the staff are extremely courteous, attentive and knowledgeable. It only gets better from that point. Fabulous food and decor make every pound spent absolutely worth the expense! "
April 2019,London Calling,"I was lucky enough to find myself searching for accommodation in London again this April for a conference.  I considered saving a few pounds and booking a large impersonal chain, but for a couple of special nights in one of my favorite cities, why not stay at my all time favorite hotel for the second time. I will tell you why not - it’s never as good is it?  The memories are always better than the reality....WELL NOT AT HOTEL 41.  It was like returning to long lost family.  I was greeted by name and immediately offered a coffee closely followed by  French champagne (scary how well they know me after just one previous visit).  My bags were quietly whisked away as we confirmed particulars and then I was invited for breakfast (favorite meal of the day).  Breakfast at Hotel 41 is…"
December 2018,Fantastic ,"Red Carnation across all their properties set the bar in their respective categories - 41 is arguably the best and in my view this is because of the team - they are exceptional. Some of the kindest, most genuine and hard working people you will meet. As always the style of property is an acquired taste (which we love) and at this price point nothing should be too much trouble - it simply never is. Yet another fantastic stay. Absolutely brilliant. Thank you again to Lauren, Andrew and the rest of the team. "
April 2019,Impeccable...,"My husband and I just returned from London.  Our stay at Hotel 41 exceeded our expectations.  From the moment we entered this property we realized we were in for something special.  Their impeccable service, attention to detail and their ability to anticipate our every need was absolutely unbelievable.  London is a wonderful city to visit and staying at this exception property only enhanced our visit all the more.  Thank you to the entire staff of 41 for your attention and kindness.  We will see you again!"
April 2019,Top Notch Service ,"Wow, my mother and I just returned from our first stay at 41- it not only exceeded our expectations but it set the bar so high I don’t know how any other hotel can compare. Beyond the aesthetically pleasing interior and rooms, the all day snacks, canapés, treats, and ice cream, & the perfect central location in London, there is the best and most attentive staff working at 41. They not only met our needs but their attention to detail and thinking one step ahead truly sets them apart from the rest! We felt like royalty- the staff knew our preferences (sometimes before we did!), had a unique attention to detail (themed surprises left in our room each day!), and truly cared about our experience and making sure our trip exceeded our expectations! This amazing service started the…"
March 2019,The best hotel I have stayed at,"The reviews for this hotel were fantastic, so I booked 2 rooms for myself and my wife and 2 friends.  The valet parking was a great help as central London is a nightmare, we were taken to the executive bar where the great experience began, from sipping complimentary champagne to canopies and some great toasted sandwiches. The staff were friendly, professional and made you feel as if you were at home. The rooms very clean, the bed was the most comfortable bed I have slept in on all my travels.  It is pricey but it is amazing, even breakfast was stunning. I cannot speak highly enough of the hotel and staff. I now know why it is voted London’s no1 boutique hotel. Location by Buckingham palace is superb,  Highly recommend this for anyone who wants a break or a romantic break, your…"
July 2018,Best Hotel in London,"Phenomenal Hotel.  Great service.  Convenient to Buckingham Palace.  The Concierge was a tremendous help with sightseeing, tickets for plays and transportation needs. I would highly recommend for anyone staying in London. "
March 2019,Wish we had stayed longer!,"This was the nicest, best customer service at a hotel we have ever stayed at. From the soft pillows and linens, steaming hot shower with tremendous water pressure to the fantastic service in the lounge and always having snacks and drinks available, this hotel really impressed us. The concierge always had great recommendations for us and everyone made sure our stay was perfect. Will definitely stay here again next time we are in London!"
March 2019,Best service,"Stayed her for a night with my wife, and i must say the service at Hotel 41 is in its own league. This is our Hotel in London, will definitely stay her when we visit London again. The hotel staff where very friendly and you felt right at home the minute you entered the door."
March 2019,Among My Greatest Hotel Experiences,"Hotel 41 is an exceptional hotel. We spent a week at Hotel 41 and had a wonderful experience. The hotel is full of character, charm, and meticulously maintained. The staff was remarkably attentive. The executive lounge is a wonderful, quiet place for breakfast, afternoon tea, or a peaceful nightcap after a day of exploring the city. Sitting by the in-room fireplace was another great way to unwind at the end of the day. It's in a great area and very walk-able to much of the city. If you choose not to walk, it never took us more than a minute to get a taxi."
March 2019,Practically perfect in every way!,"My daughter and I met in London for a weekend getaway! I had read the previous reviews from tripadvisor and booked the hotel!  The moment we arrived we were greeted by friendly staff that took us to the executive lounge and offered us champagne.  The room was comfortable and done in black and white...the beds are very comfortable!   We loved the Nespresso maker, the heated towel bar in the bathroom and the evening goodies we received at turndown service (homemade candies, lavender spray for our pillows). We enjoyed an afternoon cocktail in the executive lounge and were brought delicious Canapés and croquettes.  They also have a ""pilfer the pantry"" each evening where you can stock up on goodies between 8 pm-1 am (included). The hotel was in a great spot for site seeing and also…"
March 2019,Wonderful weekend,"I have no hesitation in recommending this charming hotel, and endorse the glowing reviews written by others. We could not have wished for a better place to stay for a luxury break in London. A lot of thought has been given to making your stay as comfortable as possible, however, it is the excellent service that makes it such wonderful experience."
February 2019,No longer a 5-Star Establishment,"I want to start by saying that this was my second time staying at Hotel 41. The first time was 4 years ago and I had an absolutely wonderful experience. I wish I could say the same for my last stay. Hotel 41 was my wife and I's last stop on our honeymoon. We had been traveling for 4 weeks, and I was so excited for her to stay at the hotel I had raved about in the past. Unfortunately that excitement was short lived. There is a very thin line between a 4 and 5 star hotel, and what we experienced at Hotel 41 was at maximum a 4 star experience. Some of the below complaints may seem petty. But that is what separates a 4 and 5 star hotel. At a 5 star hotel they should never be any complaints, especially so many...  1) The first complaint was the air temperature in the room. It was 4C…"
February 2019,Here We Go Again,"When you walk into a place and the first thing somebody says is, ‘Welcome back Mr and Mrs Gaygan, it’s lovely to see you again’, you know you are somewhere truly special.  I spoken before about how wonderful this place is but I never get bored of writing about it. It wasn’t apprehension about visiting again but I admit to thinking about whether or not it would live up to the previous three visits. Because after all, all good things must come to an end at some point, surely?  As with so many other things, Hotel41 bucks the trend and we felt totally at home even before the lift had taken us to the executive lounge.  The welcome, the room, the food (particularly the croque monsieur), the attention to detail and the care and concern from ALL staff. It was all simply wonderful.  …"
February 2019,Amazing Hotel ,"I booked this hotel as surprise to celebrate our 4th Wedding Anniversary. And based on the reviews plus the hotel being rated no1 I was excited to arrive!  We were not disappointed - we arrived late due to delayed flights but were still given the same 5 star treatment with champagne and excellent attentive staff on arrival.  Our room was lovely and the bed was extremely comfortable - just what you need after a long day/night around a London!   The hotel even surprised us with an Anniversary cake in our room and other little extras to make the trip feel very special!   The complimentary section at the hotel is also a great added extra - canapés, snacks, sweets, ice cream, breads and cheeses - just in case you feel a little peckish.   I can’t say enough about the wonderful staff…"
February 2019,Amazing ♥️,Our second stay and I thought it couldn’t get any better a beautiful hotel with fantastic service and friendly staff who go above and beyond to make your stay pleasurable.I can’t wait to stay again soon
February 2019,Just wonderful ,"What an amazing hotel, from the moment we  arrived to the time we checked out, everything was perfect. Impossible to single out any one member of staff as they are all absolutely top class. We stayed at Hotel 41 for a birthday weekend celebration and the extra little touches were a lovely addition, even arranged a surprise treat at our dinner reservation. Would recommend this place to anyone  Mark and Helen"
February 2019,The best send off!,"My wife and I were emigrating from the UK and I wanted to prepare a surprise for her for our last night. I had never heard of Hotel 41 before but was recommended it by a friend who had stayed there and loved it. My wife has a dairy allergy and the staff prepared a dairy-free chocolate cake which they left in our room with a message (written in chocolate!) wishing us luck with our new adventure. The staff were attentive, friendly and approachable, and would ask us about our upcoming move (which was a very nice touch!) My wife was thrilled with the surprise and we'd definitely stay there again when visiting London. Thank you for such a lovely night!"
February 2019,Valentines Day ,"We had been recommended this hotel by a couple we meet while on holiday, a chance meeting and a small comment”it’s the best hotel in London “ meant that upon our return we looked up “Hotel 41” and I booked for 14th February.  It was absolutely perfect for my husband and I. The staff were engaging and polite and nothing was too much trouble. Our room had everything we needed and anything else we required was only a phone call away.  A few things I feel I have to mention. It is the first hotel that we have been to that the all staff domestic maintenance even the window cleaner were exceptional always putting us first. All staff served with a smile and I genuinely believe that they enjoy working at the hotel. We watched returning customers being welcomed like old friends and staff…"
February 2019,truly exceptionnal,"I strongly recommend this hotel. Very nice place, in the center of London (near Buckingham palace). Exceptional quality of service. Rooms and bed are really great. we really appreciated the bottle of champagne offered in our room and the continuous access to high quality snacking, delicious breakfast, and so and so and so... Looking forward to go there again !"
February 2019,Perfection!,"My husband and I chose Hotel 41 for our stay in London in February of 2019. It's hard to put into words how great this hotel is! The staff is what truly makes the experience one of a kind. It's in a great location that is easily walk-able to Buckingham Palace, Parliament, Big Ben etc. We enjoyed cocktails and canapes by the fire every evening before heading out. Perhaps it was just the jet-lag, but the bed was amazing!"
December 2018,Loved every minute,Thank you so much for making my stay amazing and my Birthday. I saw the show Wicked and when I returned back to my room I had a surprise cake and a signed poster from the Wicked cast. Amazing service and great cocktails!
January 2019,Update to Simply the Best,"Rarely does a hotel continue to set new standards of defining luxury, yet Mrs. Tollman and her Carnation Group do it!   My previous post ""Still, Simply the Best"" remains accurate.  Mr. Hendry and Ms. Hargrave continue to direct an outstanding team.  The warmth, friendliness, and attention to every minor detail remain the hallmark of the 41.  The staff is extremely well trained and continues to make each stay well above the high expectations I have.  I occasionally lecture to other medical professionals on what ""service"" means, and cite many examples of our experiences there.  lf you are looking for a boutique hotel where cleanliness, luxury, attention to detail, and staff helpfulness offer a quiet respite in busy London, this is the place.   We have referred over 30 friends to…"
February 2019,Set a new standard!,Hotel 41 set a new standard for excellence.  Seldom have I experienced the wonderful staff and enjoyed the attentiveness delivered at this hotel.  Management and owners of the Hotel can be particularly proud of both these people and the excellent facility they operate.  Congratulations in order.  I intend to search out other establishments  in the Red Carnation chain in my future travels.
March 2019,Wonderful place,One of the best places I’ve stayed at in a long time. The staff are magnificent and go above and beyond. The rooms are very clean and look wonderful. I’ll definitely be returning back here soon next time I’m in the country
February 2019,Just what you want,"Firstly all the five star reviews are correct Attention to detail and customer service are first rate. Everything is as you would expect with a top quality hotel, with the lounge being a perfect refuge from the outside world. Would strongly advise you to visit if in London."
February 2019,London Short Stay Gem,"Great Hotel for a couples weekend in London or short business trip The staff are excellent, the executive lounge is a haven away from the crowds. Short walk to Buckingham palace and the Mall. This park walk takes you straight to Leicester Square  "
December 2018,Superb,"If you ever travel to London Hotel 41 is a must. We enjoyed this super Hotel for a weekend trip in December. Exceptional standard of service, great food and charming atmosphere. Sit with a glas of wine next to the fireplace! The location great too. We loved every aspect of our stay and will return."
February 2019,#1 for many reasons,"Don't bother looking at any other hotels in London, this is hands down the best hotel we have ever stayed in. I won't go into too much detail, but my husband and I felt like royalty staying here. From the turn down service with little treats that surprise you (it was my husbands 40th birthday, and they left a cake and rose petals in our room--SO lovely), to the staff knowing you by name with the friendliest attitude. It was our first time in London, and we simply want to come back just to stay at Hotel 41. Best experience ever!"
February 2019,"Return visit, just as good as last time","This was a return visit after being so impressed the first time about 3 years a go. It didnt dissapoint, from walking in the door to checking out, the service and extra mile the staff go to make sure your stay is extra special, sets this apart from the rest. Its a relatively small hotel so i guess that helps to give the experience a more homely and welcoming feel, a glass of champagne of your choice while you check in, sets the tone. The rooms are classy with the decor unique and you can tell a lot of thought has gone into the design, again to provide everything you need, whilst providing a comfortable and special space. All the amenties you would expect are in the room, but fresh fruit and pettles and a few other touches just make the experience that little bit more special.…"
February 2019,Wedding anniversary visit,Wow. From the moment that we pulled up outside we were welcomed. The concierge took our car. Fabulous check in over complimentary nibbles and choice of champagne. The rooms are perfection and ours came with flowers and cake to celebrate our anniversary. We can't wait to try breakfast.
February 2019,Impeccable service with a personalized touch!,"My family is well traveled and we have been fortunate to stay at many places, including five star luxury hotels. However, the personalized service at Hotel 41 is second to none. Each night there were kind treats and surprises left for our three children at turndown, and the amenities in the executive lounge are truly amazing. Breakfast, tea time, evening “Plunder the Pantry sessions, and more...my 5 year old daughter wants to live here, I think! Unfortunately, my boys and I were pretty sick during most of our visit to London, but the staff at Hotel 41 made this a wonderful stay nonetheless. I have never been more enthusiastic about a hotel!  Thank you to all the kind staff!"
February 2019,"""Best"" and ""Luxury"" are overused. Need more of ""Exceptional"" and ""Impeccable""","We stayed 5 nights. Upon entering the door the concierge Lenny used our name making us feel we're in the right place. The main room albeit short of space is classic, warm and well appointed. Coming to London as tourists kept us busy. We only ate breakfast here and had a gluten free afternoon tea. The house has just 28 rooms, so everything is quaint and quiet. Just the way I like it.   Guests willing to use $800+ a night know what to expect for service ATDs (attention to details). My wife and I certainly maximised our stay however the list of faux pas service issues are quite long and worth mentioning directly to the GM or GSM.    Housekeeping was perfect.  Professional staff worth mentioning; Victoria, Lenny, Vladislav, William, Mitchell, and Lauren.  Overall I love the brand…"
December 2018,Enjoying the Christmas Season In The Heart of London,"The Hotel 41 was wonderful experience. We arrived at our private entrance decorated for the season. We were greeted immediately by a staff member and shown to a private elevator that took us to the floor that makes up the Hotel 41. We then moved on to the very comfortable private lounge where we checked in. Although we were early, the room was immediately available.   The room was perfect, service was exceptional throughout our stay, the location was ideal and the private lounge was the perfect place to start and finish our busy days.  We plan to make Hotel 41 our home base during our future trips to London."
February 2019,Perfectly unperfect,"This is not a typical modern post-modern top-of-the-line 5 star hotel. Although perfectly located it is on the 5th Floor of that Building, with everything on that Floor. The Executive Lounge gives you everything you Need over day and night. The Rooms are british with more classical Elements but all very functional. It is the 'perfect unperfect'."
February 2019,The best hotel I have ever stayed at,Location is perfect-across the street from Buckinham Palace. 2 blocks away from Victoria Station. Staff was friendly yet professional. I had a damaged power cord for my laptop. When I inquired where I might buy a new one they offered to find one for me.   Beautiful English lounge is always open with snacks and drinks.  We enjoyed our stay so much we extended our trip for another 3 days.
January 2019,A very fine hotel,"From the interior appointments, to the service and staff - there was no stone left unturned. This is one of the best hotel experiences I’ve had and the location could not be better. The atmosphere is more suited to private comfort and that was key to our recharge after three weeks of travel. Also - the snack bar is on point."
January 2019,Just superb,"What can I say, from opening the door to leaving everything is just top notch luxury. This is a must stay if you can. The lounge is even better than the rooms. Right behind Buckingham Palace and within walking distance of many attractions."
January 2019,Impeccable,"What a treat. Stranded thanks to some awful weather, I thought I'd drop in and stay a night here to see what all the fuss was about. Well, I can tell you their place as top rated hotel on TripAdvisor is well deserved. From the moment I walked into the establishment, I felt like I was in good hands. Guided through check in (if you can even call it that, felt more like a pleasant conversation in a warm firelit lounge), the attention to detail is second to none. The room itself was spacious for the location with a large king bed, wonderful ensuite, and everything felt like it was in the perfect place.  The hotel itself is all on one floor, and has an intimate feel so I never felt like just another guest. They have a gorgeous executive lounge, where a tasty breakfast is served along…"
January 2019,Very enjoyable London gem,"My husband and I stayed here last week for 3 nights and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. This hotel feels tucked away and a true retreat from the busy streets outside. We had a suite which was very comfortable. We had a well stocked mini bar and plenty of glasses, tea and coffee machine, very large comfortable bed and very nice pillows. We had a problem with noise on arrival as there were builders on the roof. The staff were very swift to offer other room options and as we decided not to move we were given a bottle of champagne which was very kind. The food is very good and do eat in the sister hotel The Ruben which is below Hotel 41. We dined in their restaurant and had a super evening of delicious food and a good chat with the sommelier who was fun! The reception area in Hotel…"
November 2018,Incredible stay. Absolutely exquisite. ,"We stayed here for 1 night in November 2018. We booked Hotel 41 for its incredible reviews. We visited to be able to watch Heathers the musical in Theatre Royal Haymarket.   The booking system online is really easy to navigate, initially we booked a 3 night stay for a really reasonable price. Including breakfast. We were then sent a form by email so that concierge could tailor our stay to the way we'd like it. The form included a 'pillow menu' which I really enjoyed ordering from. They offered aromatherapy pillows, body pillows, firm soft you name it. They also offered the usual, wake up calls, newspapers etc. We found it amusing that you could request exercise equipment to be in your room. They also offer a service to order your theatre tickets. We used this service as it was…"
January 2019,Simply stunning!,"It’s hard to fault this hotel so I won’t....no detail was missed. Service was immaculate from all the staff and the food we sampled, ranging from an exquisite English breakfast, to never ending bar snacks as we were invited to “plunder the pantry” were first rate. We shall return...."
January 2019,Simply...... they just get it right!,"Now i genuinely do not say this that much as im hard to please, however..... My Wife, Snoop our cockador 5 month old puppy and I were greeted by name as we stepped out of the taxi on arrival with a warm welcome, the service started from there. My Wife and i had a champagne reception and snoop had a bowl of ""pawsecco"" (nice touch). In fact it started earlier than that, from the call i made to make the booking the attentiveness and desire to understand what makes the stay brilliant for us was expressed and carried out, this the same for all the team, it wasn't an over the top fake style either as you can get in some hotels, if you know what i mean!  We stayed in a junior suite the room was well equipped and had a very comfortable cozy atmosphere. It is very classic which reminded…"
January 2019,Amazing stay... never wanted to leave,We stayed at Hotel 41 and absolutely loved it. The service was amazing and we had such a lovely stay. Everyone was so welcoming and when they heard we were going to the Harry Potter studios they customized a few things specifically for us. The food they have during the evenings was so great and not to mention the ice cream! The rooms are wonderful and we loved reading out in the lounge area by the fire each night. The location can’t be beat either. Thank you to all that helped make our holiday in London such a wonderful experience!
January 2019,perfect as always,"This is the second time we have stayed at 41 and it is still the most perfect small hotel! The staff are exceptional and the facilities second to none. We ate in the executive lounge and when we returned to our room the staff had turned down the bed, lit the fire, lit candles and spread petals and even placed a hot water bottle in my wife's side of the bed...absolute bliss. This has now become our hotel of choice every time we visit London."
January 2019,Amazing,"We have just returned from Hotel 41 after a 3 night stay to celebrate my husband’s 60th birthday and I can honestly say this hotel is perfect. From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave nothing is too much trouble for the wonderful staff. By the second day they knew what drink we liked with breakfast and which colour toast we preferred!  We were upgraded to a suite as it was a special occasion and it was so lovely. They really have thought of everything in the rooms, lovely toiletries, robes, slippers, big comfy bed, a pillow menu, a beautiful writing desk, I could go on and on. Anything you want you just phone reception for, even a phone charger as I forgotten mine, someone was sent out to get me one! The breakfast was lovely, I had full English for a couple of days and…"
January 2019,Great Hotel .... especially the service ,"I generally don’t write reviews. Almost never. But the staff here were so thoughtful and so helpful during my three night stay that I will make an exception. This is simply a great hotel, especially if you’re on business and use the executive lounge.  The staff are exceptional. I high recommend it. "
January 2019,Exceptional,"This was our second stay and, once again, we were not disappointed! Exceptional service and staff are wonderful, attentive and charming. Our stay was faultless with a beautifully furnished and well appointed room, delicious breakfast, an incomparable selection of treats in 'the pantry', a sublime, relaxed atmosphere in the lounge and thoughtful 'little extras' at turndown.  The staff are thoughtful without being intrusive, and they manage to predict your every need, even before you do! Without doubt, we will return very soon."
January 2019,Wonderdul stay,We stayed only one night but we appreciated the staff and the place. Delicious breakfast. The Chimney fire in our room was very appreciated. Very central position. Everything was wonderful. We will come back later.
September 2018,The best hotel we've stayed at....EVER!,"We booked this hotel through Costco Travel.  It was definitely a splurge for us, but after reading so many great TA reviews, we decided it was worth it and did a cheaper hotel in Paris to compensate.    Their customer service is amazing...even before we arrived in London!   We actually booked them for 7 days, and then discovered we had to move our trip by 1 week.  Unfortunately, it looked like there was a blackout date for all Red Carnation hotels (which Hotel 41 is part of) right in the middle of our new dates, so we couldn't book with them. Costco's travel agent said there was nothing they could do, and recommended I book another hotel.  I contacted Hotel 41 and explained why we needed to move our date (brother-in-law was getting married and booked a venue without knowing we…"
January 2019,Fantastic hotel,My wife and I enjoyed a romantic vacation with superb service from Hotel 41.  We enjoyed starting the day in the executive lounge for breakfast as well as ending it there with snacks.  The staff was very helpful attending to details for us during the day as well.  Can’t wait to come back!
October 2018,Hotel 41 - a Great Place to Stay in London,Hotel 31 is a wonderful small hotel with individualized rooms.located in the heart of Knightsbridge and close to Buckingham Palace.  The  common areas feel like an upscale London club.  A true hidden gem.  Highly recommended.
November 2018,Home Away from Home,"This was my third visit to Hotel 41 and it did not disappoint! The staff were incredibly welcoming and helpful, making me feel at home. They were happy to accommodate my last minute change for my car transfer with no issues. My room was comfortable and beautiful, as always. I continue to love how well situated the hotel is to so many locations, including a quick walk to the Tube. Hotel 41 has become my home away from home while in London and I can’t wait to return on my next trip!"
October 2018,Quite literally my favorite hotel in the world!,"As good as the big five star hotels are (Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, Montage, etc.) they can’t even begin to compete with the quality and service of Hotel 41. The experience in the executive lounge is unmatched by any other hotel, whether it’s the extraordinary made to order breakfast menu, afternoon tea, complementary snacks or simply lounging about to read a book, the service is simultaneously unobtrusive and the most attentive I have ever experienced. The subtle and thoughtful touches in the room are beyond compare. Personalized cookies wishing us a good time at the theater; a hot water bottle in our bed when we returned to warm our sheets. Unheard of! If I could choose one hotel to stay at in Europe, this would be the one!"
October 2018,Impeccable service with the Queen as your neighbor.,"Literally right across the street from the Queens residence, the Hotel 41 is a hotel within a hotel, situated on the 5th floor of the Rubens hotel. From the time you enter until the time you check out you cant help but be impressed with the level of service you get from every single hotel employee you meet.  The rooms are a little tight but we did have a king size bed and were able to function fine in the room.  Without even having to go outside you can walk through to the Rubens hotel and have afternoon tea, a great dinner at the English Grill or a drink at one of the bars.   Victoria station and the tube entrance are less than a 5 minute walk. This is a great location for tourists."
October 2018,Service and location second to none!,Before we even arrived on Oct. 29th the staff at the hotel was contacting us to see what they could arrange for us ahead of time. Upon our arrival we were treated like royalty. They gave us champagne and a comfort room to store our luggage and freshen us. Once our rom was ready they upgraded us without our asking. The room was on 2 stories complete with fireplace. The breakfast and afternoon tea were amazing. It is close to some theatres and right next to Buckingham Palace. We will stay here again!
June 2018,God Save the Queen. And 41. ,"My wife and I had the good fortune to stay at this hotel for about a week. The hotel has a great location next to Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station. Essentially, everything in London is within reach. But what makes this hotel special isn’t the location, nor the building itself. It’s the employees, who are clearly well trained in hospitality and have an obvious love for what they do. They are kind, friendly, helpful and always seem to have the answers when the questions are asked. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at 41 and will be back when in London again. "
November 2018,Perfect as always,"We went for our annual Christmas time visit to Hotel 41 and this time actually stayed over Christmas. We arrived on Christmas Eve and stayed for 4 nights in a split level junior suite which we have stayed in previously.   I honestly cannot give this hotel enough compliments. Everything about it is absolutely perfect. It has to be our favourite hotel in the world. It is just so relaxing and you would never know that you are in the middle of London. All of the staff are very friendly and treat you as a friend and a special mention to Lauren the resident manager who will always stop for a chat.   We have no negative comments to make on our stay and have already booked again for December 2019 for a pre-Christmas break.   In addition to the hotel, the Nova complex is also very nice…"
December 2018,Outstanding as always,"Simply the best hotel in London! It's easy to forget you are even in London as you leave the noise behind and enter the tranquil world of Hotel 41. The ""Whatever, Whenever"" button in the room perhaps gives the best insight into the quality of the service. Breakfast was excellent and the evening canapés, nibbles and small plates menu are incredible, particularly considering they are included in the room rate."
December 2018,Zena,"Just back from another visit to the 41 as always everything was perfect, we were able to watch the fireworks on the rooftop on New Year’s Eve with a glass of champagne, every single member of staff are just wonderful, food excellent bedrooms are fantastic lovely touches from the turndown service hopefully see you again soon "
December 2018,Best ever,I come to this hotel twice a year and it never fails. Service is almost perfect. There are always one or two people at the registration desk who will arrange anything needed. Small (only 28 rooms) but exquisite.
January 2019,Consistently excellent,"Just back from what has become a traditional pre-Christmas stay at 41. The most relaxing yet, as we made sure this time to spend the evening in the Executive Lounge by the fire enjoying sweet and savoury treats from the Pantry, before a great night's sleep and a wonderful breakfast selection the following morning. As ever, we were very well looked after by the entire team who continue to provide an excellent experience for guests.  We look forward to returning in 2019."
December 2018,Perfection,It’s been a few years since our last stay at 41 and I’m pleased to say it’s still as good as ever.  From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave the team make your stay magical.  Upon arrival there is free flowing champagne and they have an open pantry of delicious snacks and soft drinks.  The rooms a very comfortable and well maintained as are the bathrooms.  The location is just behind Buckingham Palace so it’s a short walk to Piccadilly or Kensington.  It’s just lovely and worth every penny.
December 2018,At Christmas Time✨🥂✨,Hotel 41 is simply wonderful. Welcomed with 🥂🔥 and all the delightful team.. A very special place. We made sure we had time for Cheese Toasties this visit😋 Always so happy here!! Thank you ALL of you💕Absolute perfection in absolutely everyway✨XX
December 2018,"Personal, discrete and exceptional luxury","We stayed here for 1 night, in an Executive King Room. Picked a rate excluding breakfast, so we didn't get to try that.  Our stay was fantastic and we would recommend this to anyone.  Highlights:  + Incredible staff with impeccable attention to detail. We were addressed by name by most staff members throughout our 1-night stay. They had also noted the Swedish tradition of advent and made a little arrangement around this in our room.  + Fantastic executive lounge with high-quality nibbles, snacks and food around the clock. There's also a great honesty bar, great seating and a cosy fireplace.  + The ambiance, atmosphere and service is refined and discrete - yet personal and warm. It truly feels like being at home, but with 5-star service around you.  + Welcome drink, where 4…"
December 2018,Exceptional Service and Comfort,"Without a doubt this is one of the best hotels i have stayed in. Being Local to the area i only reserve staying at 5 star hotels abroad but this was a treat and a class above the usual hotels. There is so much character to the hotel and rooms themselves. The breakfast spread was amazing and plenty of options for a vegetarian like myself.  The bathroom was clean, spacious and full of all complementary toiletries.  Warm and cosy beds. Highly recommend  "
December 2018,Simply exceptional,I've stayed in many 5 star luxury hotels...none come close to Hotel 41. This was a truly exceptional experience.  Pros: - they read your mind and seem to know what you want before you even ask. - staff are wonderfully attentive without being intrusive. - excellent rest in a very comfortable bed. - incredible attention to detail both in the room and around the hotel. - stunningly beautiful hotel.  Cons: - none
November 2018,Wonderful Experience ,"We opted to celebrate our 12th anniversary with a weekend stay at Hotel41 and were treated to an upgrade. It was a surprise that was very much appreciated and the split-level suite and its facilities were exceptional. There was a handwritten note, a bowl of fruit and later a small cake to welcome us. Housekeeping made sure the room was always in good condition and there were even lotions and a hot water bottle on my bed during evening turndowns. Certainly most thoughtful as unbeknownst, I was suffering from a sprained back.   Staff took time to cater to our needs and made sure that we were comfortable yet were unobtrusive and afforded us privacy. Questions were always answered and requests were looked into very quickly. There were staff that delivered professional service yet…"
October 2018,Beautiful hotel,"Absolutely fantastic hotel, right across the street from Buckingham Pslave. Extremely good service , top notch!!! The only negative would be that the rooms are very small which is not uncommon in Europe. Every night they left something in your room such as chocolates, rose petals etc. I would also highly recommend the tea and dinner at the English Grille in the Ruben. ( essentially hotel 41 is the 5th floor of the Ruben but you have a separate entrance"
October 2018,Stephen,Wonderful hotel full of fantastic attentive staff. Classic English style and atmosphere makes it extra special -a proper London hotel! Loved the executive lounge and all the snacks available on the house. Loved the fire place and fire on my arrival to my bedroom so cozy and inviting.  Bed was lovely and comfortable and the Breakfast was fantastic. Absolutely no complaints I’ll be back.
October 2018,First Visit ,"Thank you for a wonderful first stay. I enjoyed every second of it. All the staff friendly and I thank them for that. Special thanks go to the reception team for booking and then cancelling the dinner reservation several times, to Stephen for his kindness when the week didn’t go to plan, to the housekeeping staff - I loved the little touches on turndown and all the chefs, kitchen staff, waitresses and waiters the food was superb. I am looking forward to another stay soon. Sue xx"
October 2018,Truly amazing 5* and more,"This was our second visit to hotel 41 as we first visited last year for our 25th anniversary and were so impressed came back for our 26th. This hotel is simply the best, from the moment you step through the door to the moment you leave the service is impeccable and personal. The lounge is a haven to relax in with wonderful food and drinks whenever you want. The rooms are truly Devine, we were lucky enough to be upgraded to the conservatory suite, wow amazing. Im not sure we will ever find a hotel to top 41 and hope we are fortunate enough to be able to return next year."
October 2018,"First class, amazing all around","From the moment we checked in until we left 5 days later we were thoroughly impressed. The staff was very helpful booking tickets to any activities that interested us, the food from breakfast to dinner being offered right there in the private lounge was top notch and delicious. The maid service was above and beyond with nice little night cap gifts each evening. The rooms were very tastefully done with deep soaking tubs and very comfortable accommodations. The knowledge and service of all the concierge was great, everyone was very eager to assist and very helpful with questions. The fire in the private lounge area was very warm and inviting after a long day of exploring the city. The location of the hotel was perfect, walking to all the parks and attractions as well as the…"
September 2018,Right at home! ,The hotel is amazing but what made this stay so special was the wonderful staff!  They were helpful with anything I needed from arranging a car for the airport to the attention and personal service at breakfast.  The rooms are beautifully decorated and the bed is so comfortable! Every amenity you could possibly need is available and this is a great location right by Buckingham Palace. Being a small boutique hotel has its advantages with such personal service.  Bravo Hotel 41!  Looking forward to another visit in the future!  
September 2018,Excellent staff responsiveness,"Our stay at Hotel 41 was our best hotel experience in 40 years. The staff was excellent and everyone was very responsive to any questions and requests. After a couple days, they were aware of our dietary restrictions and made sure they were reflected in the excellent breakfasts and snacks throughout the day. The hotel is very centrally located near Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station."
October 2018,One of the very best hotels I have ever visited! ,"My daughter (aged 14) and me stayed at the hotel for one night. What a pleasure! The hotel is luxury, and the staff are just very very nice, and make you feel special and wellcome. Pure luxury, at the same time a relaxed and friendly athmosphere.   The breakfast/ lounge/ restaurant room is just like an old fashioned adventure. We had a drink there after the restaurant, and the staff made a very nice alchohol-free drink for my daughter (and the very best Margarita for me).  The stay was completed with a very nice breakfast.   We will be back 41! You are a hidden pearl, I hope many people with find you.   The hotel is very close to Buckingham Palace. We had a nice walk passing by the castle through Green Park and then you are in the middle of everything.  Victoria station is also…"
October 2018,Stunning and elegant!,"We absolutely loved this hotel. The location couldn't be better; an oasis of quiet and calm but steps away from the nightlife and Victoria Station (as well as the underground).  The staff thought of everything! We particularly enjoyed evening drinks which always included canapés and ""toasties"". We discovered the ice cream fridge early on and together managed to sample six out of a possible ten varieties. We're coming back soon to try the rest!"
August 2018,Fantastic place to stay.,"What makes this place special is not the fantastic location, nor the great room, not the spectacular service. It is the staff. Friendly, helpful, and just all around nice. We had a fantastic stay, walking distance to all kinds of places, but the people really helped make the experience one of the best I have ever had traveling. Thank you."
September 2018,Perfection!,"Outstanding experience.  Great facilities, but staff made the experience.  Every single person I met was professional, cordial, and went out of their way to make me feel at home and make my holiday a success."
September 2018,1st Class with some more!,"We had a fantastic time, the hotel, staff, bedrooms, exec lounge, food and ""plunder in the pantry"" were all 'simply the best'. The 3 days were not long enough, anyone visiting this hotel need to consider spending more time at the Hotel, breakfast was great, dinner at the Rubens 1st class but evenings in the Exec Lounge was brilliant."
September 2018,Gem of a hotel,"We stayed here to celebrate my husband's 50th Birthday.  From the minute we arrived, we were made to feel special and welcome.  The staff were all amazing; they were always on hand to help and advise but not in an overpowering way.  This is just the most wonderful hotel and we will definitely come back for our next big celebration."
September 2018,Wow ,"Fantastic place, fantastic staff and fantastic atmosphere! Felt so comfortable and relaxed and like I didn’t want to go home after my visit, I would recommend to friends and family and will definitely revisit this hotel. "
September 2018,Fabulous Beautiful Hotel!,"Hotel 41 is simply wonderful!  It is extremely lovely and every aspect is special!  The location is excellent and centralized for getting around in the city of London.  The lounge for meals was so beautiful and very comfortable, and the food was very well done for breakfast each morning. We loved it!  Our room was great and was maintained perfectly every day.   One of the most special aspects about the hotel is the absolutely wonderful staff!  Each and every one of them made us feel very welcomed and important and were exceptionally helpful.  I have no doubt that when we return to London, we will be staying at Hotel 41 again!"
September 2018,Birthday trip,"This is my second time staying at Hotel 41 and it was wonderful! This visit was with my mom and aunt. My aunt had several special dining and room requests and the staff were incredibly accommodating. We were visiting for my mom's birthday and the hotel had a special piece of birthday cake waiting for her in our room, such a lovely touch. All of the staff are just really top notch, I can't say enough about the support from my initial emails with Adele, to Lauren, Victoria and Gabriel once at the hotel. Thank you for such an amazing visit."
September 2018,Small but miraculous!!!!,"Everything was perfect! Our arrival was warm with a glass of champaign. The Room was very comfortable with enough space for our suitcases and absolutely marvellous! Every detail is special, even the slippers were separated with 'His' & 'Hers' bags! The amenities were wonderfoul and the maids were adding the missing ones. the breakfast also, even though the place is quite small, had almost everything! Everybody makes you feel like a Queen & a King! many thanks!"
September 2018,Luxury hotel!!,"Me and my wife stayed at this hotel for one night,just to try an exclusive hotel during our stay in London  Everything,from the staff,the decor , the detail and the atmosphere generally,was perfect. The breakfast was delicious .The private lounge was beutiful  The room including the bathroom was extremely spacious. Location was perfect with a short walk from Victoria Station. It is a short way if you want to visit the Royal Mews which is located just across the street from the hotel. Buckingham Palace is a just down the street. The drinks in the executive lounge after a day of sightseeing is really relaxing. Absolutely worth a visit"
August 2018,Simply the best,"If you enjoy the chi-chi chic, bling-bling, ostentatious type of 5 star hotel, well, Hotel 41 is not for you. However, if you enjoy unassuming elegance, uncompromising quality, and superior personalised service, then you'll absolutely love this boutique hotel. Located on the 5th floor of the buildlng, you could pass by the discrete entrance of this hotel without noticing it. But as soon as you present yourself at the door, that first impression of extremely attentive service is not just an impression. We were  welcomed with a glass of champagne and small hors d'oeuvres, while we waited just 15 minutes or so as they finished preparing our room, requested for early check-in.. We felt pampered throughout our 7 day stay. Rooms are of a very respectable size, spotlessly clean, and…"
September 2018,Continues to be the best,"We arrived from an overnight flight at 8:a.m., tired and bedraggled, knowing our check in time wasn’t for hours.Although our room wasn’t ready, Hotel 41 brought our luggage to a “courtesy room,” which was one of their standard rooms, where we napped until our booked room was ready. Hotel 41 then upgraded us to a junior suite. The service, as always, was perfect. This is truly a great hotel and I can’t wait to come back."
July 2018,1st visit to London ,"Absolutely loved my 6 days in Hotel 41. The rooms were comfortable, the pillows my favourite!The staff just gave you their utmost service. Nothing was beyond them in trying to please and make our stay memorable. We would love to return to this splendid Hotel. Superb in every way ! "
September 2018,Our Recent Stay,This is a 28 room boutique hotel located on the 5th floor with a small ground floor entry. The service is excellent and what you would expect and desire....best service I have ever experienced while travelling. The rooms are cozy and very comfortable...shower is excellent and set-up as a rain shower and they have a separate bathtub with shower. The bath products are wonderful...Penhaligon's of London....brought these back with us. The hotel is located adjacent to the Royal Mews which is part of Buckingham Palace. There are several Bar/Restaurants as part of a outdoor pavilion to the left of the hotel as you leave if you get hungry or want a drink at night. One tip for this area and London in general...there are several street closures due to construction so give yourself extra…
September 2018,London,"Can I rate more than 5 stars?  Wonderful hotel with wonderful people.  Odd little place, only the 5th floor of Rubens Hotel, but what charm!  Lots packed into a small space.  In London to celebrate birthday and 25th anniversary and I actually felt cherished by the whole staff.  Patrycja's smiling face every morning at breakfast a bonus. One block to Buckingham Palace, one block to Victoria Palace Theatre to see Hamilton. Excellent hotel, excellent trip.  I would return to 41 any time in London."
September 2018,Superb!!!,"Visited with my wife on her birthday and, having held our wedding at another Red Carnation hotel, had high expectations which were more than met by the warm, friendly welcome and marvellous service we experienced throughout our stay.  The room was extremely comfortable and of a good size, well presented and maintained. The champagne on ice, candles and rose petals arrayed when we returned from our evening out was a fabulous touch and made for an even more memorable occasion.  Breakfast was brilliant, and they catered for my wife’s vegan diet superbly well.  You will not be disappointed at Hotel 41!   "
October 2018,I loved 41 ?,"The hotel was in a great location. We loved the little feeling and attention to guests.  first of all? I am very happy to save money thanks to this magic place: savehotel.ml  the manager, was overdone. She welcomed us and assisted with all our needs. She and her staff really make you feel special. The room was very spacious, clean, large and comfortable.  Will stay again when I am in London."
October 2018,Amazing hotel!,I can’t say enough wonderful things about our experience at Hotel 41!  The staff in particular from Steven to Dean to Mitchell just made us feel like we were part of the 41 family.   I can say without question the best travel experience my wife and I have ever had.  We plan to visit London again in the next year and the only hotel we will stay at is 41!   Cheers!
October 2018,Outstanding,"What can I say more than it was Great. The standard service is beyond anything I have ever  experienced. I  have stayed in many fine hotels, but this might just be the finest.  The bedding and linen were all top drawer and comfy."
October 2018,Royal Treatment in a Royal Hotel,"The service and attention paid to guests was excellent. I could not have asked for more. Location was great, just a short walk to Buckingham Palace. Lots of other destinations that you could walk to or take a short Uber/cab ride."
September 2018,Amazing place to stay! ,"Most amazing hotel we have ever been! Service is 5 stars, rooms are clean and comfortable, we only stayed for a couple of nights and were quite sad to leave. Food is also excellent!  Worth every penny!"
October 2018,Loved it great stay,I go every year sometimes the cleanliness in the rooms could do with extra attention staff especially the lad with curly hair very attentive always great .the rooms very very clean .i love it pool are great
October 2018,One of the Finest,"From the glass of champagne at check in, hot water bottle in bed, candle lite every evening in the bedroom to the toasties at the executive lounge.... what else could you ask for. The location was perfect, the staff is top notch (Mr. Steve Jones is in his element) and the hotel amenities are far beyond what you would expect.    Our stay at Hotel 41 was top notch and absolutely perfect."
October 2018,Perfect 20the Wedding Anniversary Stay,"Our first trip to London staying at Hotel41 exceeded my already high expectations knowing that it is a 5 star rated hotel.  We stayed in an Executive King room. The room had every amenity you could imagine,  including towel warmers in the bathroom, separate tub and shower stall, desk stocked with every office supply you might need ( I needed a staple remover and stapler).  Nespresso machine and hot pot also in the room.  The quality and efficiency of the service throughout the hotel was of a level I have not experienced ever.  The check-in experience, the sincerity and the warmth of the greetings leaving the hotel for the day or coming back , the efficiency of taking orders for breakfast, after dinner drinks , the clearing of plates is unrivaled.  I asked about adapters for…"
October 2018,Hidden Gem,My wife and I with our 8 yo son and 10 yo daughter stayed at Hotel 41 for four consecutive nights and then a single night when we came back from Paris to fly back to California. We all had a great time. The staff were amazing! The Lounge was a huge highlight of our trip too.  Great food and beautiful place to hang out after dinner. Kids loved Jude’s ice cream at the lounge. The black coconut flavor is amazing. The location of the hotel is perfect too. Half a mile from Hyde Park made it perfect for running and they have a couple of nice gyms within a block of the hotel
October 2018,Incredible,"This was the most incredible, unique experience for us for a hotel stay.  We stayed 5 nights and the staff are amazing.  The room was great (usual London sized), but the experience was fantastic.  I couldn't imagine staying anywhere else in London.  Every hotel we have stayed at and will stay at will probably not compare to this place.  Other hotels need to take a lesson."
November 2018,Fabulous from beginning to end,Spent 3 nights here for my 50th Birthday. Suite was amazing and immaculate. Little touches like pillow spray before bed make it extra special. Bed very comfortable. All staff very polite & can't do enough for you. Breakfast delicious. Will definitely return.
November 2018,The Best Service Ever - Loved it!,"We stayed at the 41 Hotel for 3 nights during our honeymoon. We received a warm welcome with champagne and dessert. The staff were absolutely wonderful. They helped us plan our trip at every turn and really cared about our experience. It felt nice to come in at the end of the day and chat with the staff and get their advice. They'll remind you to take an umbrella or book things for you and point you in the right direction. They help you WITHOUT HESITATION. You never feel like you're bothering them or you're a burden. We've stayed at properties like the FS, Ritz, etc. and the service is on par, if not much better.  There's also a lovely executive lounge where there are free snacks. Every day in your room they'll leave you something new or cute like eye cream or something. If you…"
December 2018,"Remarkable, Generous & Kind!","I have booked just one night at Hotel 41, as I was curious to know the reasons behind all of these positive reviews, and I wasn’t disappointed! Since the first moment the hotel treated me with generosity, as I’ve arrived to the hotel around 6am and I knew that the check-in time was 2pm, but without any hesitation, they checked me in one of the rooms till my room was ready.  The staff was amazingly kind and helpful, the bed was so comfortable and the sleeping experience was second to none.  I wish they had bidet in the bathrooms. Otherwise the stay was a happy story to tell!"
November 2018,Impeccable!,"I have to say that the service we received was impeccable. The staff were all so polite and could not do enough for us. We commented that whilst we were over the road from Buckingham Palace, we felt like we were in it with a the plentiful and super professional staff on hand for our every need. The room was immaculate and the bed linen perfect. The breakfast was delicious served in the beautiful lounge again by staff who were incredibly attentive. The Curry Room at the Rubens next door was also fantastic.We will most certainly return."
November 2018,The Staff Are The Best!,Recently stayed for a couple of nights while having a short break in London. Due to all the amazing reviews from Trip Advisor we decided to try the hotel for our first stay at this location. From the moment you walk in to when you leave the fantastic staff cannot do enough for you and they are all so helpful and friendly and i would imagine if travelling on your own this hotel would be ideal. From entering the building you take the lift to the 5th floor where the hotel and its 28 rooms are located. very cosy and intimate and a very nice lounge where you can check in and also serves as the breakfast/dinner area and evening drinks. Lovely wooden features and an open fire with very comfortable chairs and couches. The breakfast was wonderful with an extensive choice and excellent…
November 2018,Excellent in every way,"This hotel is one of the greatest hotels in London. I have stayed there a few days ago again and the service that was already excellent, has even been improved. The staff is just perfect, giving a more than a perfect service. The rooms are exquisite . There is just nothing bad to say about the hotel. Just go there and see for yourself"
November 2018,Surpassed my expectations!,"What a treat to have spent a couple of days at the beginning of my husband and I's 10 year Europe trip here. I expected big things based on the reviews, and Hotel 41 certainly delivered. I don't even know where to start... From the champagne when we first arrived, to friendly assistance in finding fun things to do, to the dairy free lattes being delivered to our room after wake up each morning, to the cosy lounge, to the delicious packed lunch for our train ride to Paris....the list goes on. The care, detail and service at this hotel is exceptional. Thank you for creating memories for my husband and I that we will never forget."
November 2018,Excellent,"We stayed here for one night for some Christmas shopping, although we only live up the road in North London. The hotel was absolutely excellent. It felt small and intimate, the service was very good (but not intrusive) and the quality of everything in the room was was top-notch. Little touches like lighting the fire in our room or leaving a hot water bottle, or the champagne trolley on arrival, add to the experience. I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants a quality stay away from the hullabaloo of other bigger 5* London hotels."
November 2018,Super nice ,"Stayed her with my daughter on our last night, wished I had made it 2. We arrived a bit early and was taken up to the club lounge where we sat in the lovely surroundings and enjoyed a complimentary glass of champagne. Very good location an easy walk from the station and heaps of restaurants.  Hotel was beautiful. Staff all so friendly. Our room was the nicest of our stay, we had some delicious sweets in our room, free water and a cosy fireplace. In the evening the staff came to turn down the bed and left us with a hot water bottle and some eye cream , a nice touch. Lounge had a great atmosphere to just relax and enjoy a drink in the evening, and enjoy the included nibbles. We went to the bag o nails for our evening meal, then came to lounge and enjoyed cheese and biscuits. …"
November 2018,The Best,"I’be been several times there and is my prefered hotel in London. Staff is amazing, they are always ready to help you, anticipate your needs, and the best is they are effective always! Last time I was arriving late everywhere but cominicating with them by email they helped to manage and change my bookings (restaurants & shows) on the go. It is a small hotel but very comfortable, you feel there like in a club where you have been member since 10 yrs ago and everybody knows you. At same time is very quiet. Location in front of Buckingham Palace and near Victora is perfect also. Only one warning, as it is small you should book in maximum advance because some times is fully booked (although they manage to help you to find another hotel nearby).  Only good memories about 41!"
August 2018,One Night Theatre Visit,"It is really hard to get the correct tone for this review as so many brilliant and colourful reviews already exist.  There is little point in repeating what is already plain, almost all of which we would agree with, highlighting the exceptional care are friendliness of the hotel team and the intimate “club” like feel.  Our room was a little dim looking into a very unattractive courtyard which was a little disappointing but not disastrous.  Is it the best hotel in London?  This depends what you want from a hotel, but based entirely on the fact we stayed at another of their wonderful hotels, The Milestone, I would say it could only possibly be 2nd best.  A lovely stay nevertheless.  "
August 2018,Enchanting hideaway in the centre of London,"This was my second visit, and if at all possible this place is better than on my previous visit.  It’s a bolt hole, private, and the service is impeccable.   No traffic noise, well appointed rooms and enormously comfortable.  I can only say that we will return again and again.  You will see from other reviews that I am someone who travels the world frequently, and I do have my favourite hotels in different capital cities.  This is the one for London."
August 2018,The best of the best in London,"My second stay at this hideaway in the centre of London.  It is a superb hidden gem in the centre of a busy city.  The quality of this place is unbeatable, and the service and help for guests is like no other in the world.  We will return as we thoroughly enjoyed our short stay."
August 2018,Excellent hotel,"41 made us feel like royalty for a week! Everything was taken care of for us, the staff is so attentive and kind, they also give great recommendations for tour companies and food. The location of the hotel is great as well. I really appreciate how the staff went above and beyond. Thank you all again!"
August 2018,A very good option.,"We have recently enjoyed a three night stay in a split level suite which was a pleasant experience. All staff were helpfull and attentive, all our needs were met and without doubt this hotel does deserve it's ranking amongst the higher echelons of London hotels. Breakfast is a quiet and relaxed affair and the lounge is comfortable.  Our room was a reasonable size with all you would expect for the price paid. The location is excellent, walking is a pleasure and all you need is close at hand.  A big shout out to all the staff we encountered and a big thank you.  This hotel is ran like a Special Forces Unit, 99.9% need not apply!"
December 2017,Outrageously Good,"Well, what can I say. I was left spellbound by their service and the comfort and amenities.  The location is absolutely amazing.  If you have the money, go for it. You won't regret it. Even at this price, this gives you the highest bang for the buck in such a central location of London."
July 2018,The Hotel that keeps on delivering a 5-star experience…,"I’ve left my fair share of reviews every time we come back to 41Hotel, for a very good reason!   This Hotel is and absolutely deserves to be number 1!   The service, personalised experience, familiar faces, staff and location all make for this hotel being one easy way to get comfortable when travelling back to London and almost has a way of making you feel ... like you never left or that you're part of the family!   Another exceptional stay which has a lot to do with the staff.  Thank you again!"
August 2018,Nice find,Travelling its fun and sometimes tiring I'm so glad I stayed here. Very clean and great service. Worth every penny. Highly recommend to you all travellers or even if you visiting this place is just amazing find. See u next time :). Thank you
July 2018,Luxury at its finest!,"I found Hotel 41, here on trip advisor. My husband and I came to London as a part of our 20th wedding anniversary. I cannot express enough about this hotel! The staff put effort in every detail. We arrived and checked in early from a red eye flight. The staff took our luggage and guided us to the executive lounge to complete check in. First, we were offered a delicious complimentary glass of champagne. Our room wasn’t quite ready, which we expected. We stayed in the executive lounge and were presented with snacks and comfort while we waited (no more than 15 minutes). After arriving to the room, In which Adele assisted us to; along with giving us information and plenty of advice of things to do, we slowly took in the details of this beautiful room in 01. Very beautiful and clean.…"
July 2018,Hotel 41 Meets The Royal Standard of Excellence,"My stay at 41 more than exceeded my expectations. From cheerful manners, attentive service, exceptional surroundings, practical help, delicious food and fine conversation, the entire staff enriched my trip to London in every possible way. I was treated like a highly honored guest.  "
September 2018,The friendliest staff,"The staff truly make a stay at 41 exceptional. They are so friendly and so willing to help. The location of this hotel is perfect, so close to Buckingham Palace. The tube station Victoria is less than a 5 minute walk and allows you to be anywhere fast.  Breakfast is delicious and includes some real British treats.  We thoroughly enjoyed the Afternoon Tea that we booked as an extra.  The snacks available all day and night are also delicious. Our room was perfect."
August 2018,FABULOUS Hotel! Attention to detail is unrivaled.,"I made a great choice selecting Hotel 41 as the destination to celebrate my 50th Birthday. It was the attention they gave to the smallest details that made my stay extra special. It begin upon my arrival, with having my room ready way before the advertised 2:00pm check-in. I was amazed when I got to my room, they had a small birthday cake and sweets for me. Part of my trip included seeing the musical Hamilton, and to my shock they prepared macaroons with the logo for Hamilton, and an note to enjoy the show.Turn down service with candles and rose petals and a staff that was attentive, helpful and available to handle your every request puts Hotel 41 above all the rest. I would definitely stay here again. Loved every minute of my visit."
September 2018,We will be back!,"Thank you for such a special visit. So happy I came across this little gem of a hotel when looking for something very special and a little bit different for my husbands 40th birthday treat.  We were both sad to leave today after being looked after so well where all the staff actually took the time to get to know us by name and do everything possible to ensure we had a great weekend. The birthday champagne and cake were also lovely gestures!!  A big shout out to Steve Jones - a really interesting guy happy to share all his tips and travel ideas. We would love to come back soon to try out the new roof top terrace ;) This hotel is well worth the price tag! Great value for a hotel of this quality in London.  Thanks again, Sarah and Gareth Evans x"
August 2018,BOUTIQUE HOTEL - EXCEPTIONAL,"We have once again stayed at Hotel 41 - without a doubt it is one of the best hotels we have stayed in - exceptional service, surroundings and facilities.  When you walk in it is like walking into your own oasis of peacefulness and wonderful staff who are there to help you.  Special thanks to Magdalena, Lauren Hargrave, Lauren & Marlen whose help was invaluable.  We will be back next year to sample the wonderful hospitality received at Hotel 41.  Thanks once again from the both of us."
August 2018,One of the best hotels we have stayed in,This discrete boutique hotel is one of the best places we have stayed in. Tucked away above the Reubens Hotel it is ideally placed for sightseeing in the capital< Although quite small it has all the facilities you need and much more besides. The staff are incredibly attentive and nothing is too much trouble. Breakfast was good and there were a range of snacks available throughout the day. Rooms are a good size and very well equipped. It is quite expensive but definitely value for money
August 2018,Magnificent ,"Gorgeous boutique style hotel located very close to Buckingham Palace. It’s a small hotel next to the much larger Ruebens Hotel. The reception team make you feel so welcome on arrival. The glass of champagne and canapés were a welcome treat after a long car journey. The rooms are lovely. Mainly decorated in black and white. They are very modern, but classically English at the same time.. a unique blend of interior design. The staff are very helpful for reservations, advice etc. The breakfast is lovely and hot dishes are cooked to perfection. Breakfast should be savoured that this place... don’t rush it.. it’s simply divine. The lounge area with sweet treats is a lovely touch. We were treated to a room upgrade part way through our stay which was a lovely gesture and allowed us to…"
August 2018,"Lovely hotel, great staff","Stayed for a couple of nights, the hotel is great and the staff are very good.   Wr didnt have breakfast but the canapes later in the day were very nice.   The location is fab, 5 mins from Victoria so great transport links.   The bedrooms are well appointed if somewhat small but the whole hotel is quirky (good).    Attention to detail by the staff is excellent.  The toiletries provided are high end.  The shower is amazing, phenomenal water pressure.  Beds are comfy.    Lovely as a treat and perfect for a special occasion, not sure id stretch to this price point unless it was a special occasion. "
August 2018,Another incredible stay,"We had a three night stay and had a wonderful time.  All of the staff were amazing, remembering what we liked to eat and drink on the first day, and making us feel extremely comfortable from the beginning of our time at the Hotel 41.  The 41 is an intimate boutique hotel, with excellent and personalized customer service.  We will certainly return to the hotel when we’re in London."
August 2018,Simply amazing,"We stayed at the hotel for our anniversary . All I can say is  it was just beautiful was start to finish . The staff , the decor , the attention to detail and the atmosphere simply perfect. I’ve been lucky enough to stay at beautiful hotels all over the world , but this one is magnificent. Everyone in the place cares . They lit candles in the evening for when we returned , the breakfast is delicious . The private lounge beautiful . I love it all . Had a fabulous time and would recommend you stay . Basically the best hotel in London , I’ve stayed at all the big pricey places . Never again , I’ll be back here . One day they might adopt me and I can just live there full time ."
August 2018,Perfect!,"We just returned from a 10th anniversary trip to London and Edinburg.  I spent much time researching the right hotels for our trip.  Hotel 41 was simply amazing!  The staff were all friendly and extremely helpful and everyone knew our names!  They had a special anniversary cake and bottle of champagne for us which was so incredibly special.    The room including the bathroom was extremely spacious.  Location was perfect.  Just a short walk to Victoria Station.  We really enjoyed our visit to the Royal Mews which is located across the street from the hotel.  Buckingham Palace is a little further down the road.  The complimentary treats throughout the day, canapés in the evening, ice cream and late night pantry are all additional benefits of this hotel at no additional cost. …"
July 2018,Outstanding attention to detail and customer comfort,There is a good reason 41 is so highly rated by its visiting customers. It is their outstanding attention to customer care and comfort. The room assigned though not terribly spacious had every comfort feature you could possibly want. The bed was particularly comfortable with a perfectly balanced duvet. Of the right weight too. The highly branded 41 property will leave you wondering what else could they have done for you to remember 41. It's not all the 41 logos that you see on everything but the human interaction of the amazing staff. Including the highly experience South African F&B manager whose recommendations one should listen to. He will charm you to dizzying heights. That is what you will remember best from 41. The rest can be chaulked as world class creature comforts but…
February 2018,Fabulous,"I was booked for 2 nights first, after 2 I’ve decided do stay here for my entire business trip.  Rooms are spacious and comfortable, clean. Food is delicious! Staff are helpful, they will go forward to make your stay perfect. Definitely would recommend"
June 2018,London Luxury,We stayed here twice for a total of six nights. The staff remember your names and provide outstanding services. The hotel is above the Rubens Hotel and related. The facilities are well done and stylish. We have stayed at many other London hotels but would consider this to be our new London home. It is in a walkable and safe location with good restaurants and theaters nearby. Worth it!
June 2018,I think they invented 6-star service,"Seriously, I've never had service so attentive anyplace, and I've been to some swanky places. This is a small hotel so you get a lot of personal attention from the staff - I'm still trying to figure out how everyone knew my name on the first day. You'll read about the executive lounge a lot in other reviews, and it is a very nicely appointed room that you'll walk through a lot on the way to your room and the check in and check out. Don't expect to make your way through that room without stopping for an assortment of drinks, canapes, and other goodies - the staff will just make sure it magically happens for you. During breakfast and dinner times more substantial food is offered as well.  The room itself was well appointed and the bed was quite comfortable. It is small, so don't…"
November 2017,40th birthday treat,"Took my husband to London to celebrate his 40th birthday.  Stayed over a weekend in a double room.  Fantastic welcome, beautiful room, only issue was that we walked everywhere and had to resist the concierge's urge to sort us out with taxis!  Food at breakfast plentiful and varied and snack ""larder"" available later in the day although we had so many lovely nights out we didn't need to avail ourselves.  Great luxury London base."
April 2018,"Brilliant hotel, with staff who go out of their way to help you","This was our second time staying at Hotel 41, and it was even better than the last time. When planning the trip we had booked a world class restaurant for one of the nights. However two weeks before we arrived the menu changed to one where I would not be able to eat anything on the menu. After trying to organise something with the restaurant, we decided to find something else. We contacted Hotel 41 and the concierge staff were superb and quickly provided multiple options covering a large range of foods. When we picked one, Hotel 41 then arranged everything for us. Once we arrived, the staff were excellent, asking what our plans were and if there was anything that they could help with (including organising tickets to the more popular shows). The room was well laid out and…"
June 2018,4th stay and still out of this world ,Wow this place still keeps amazing me. It’s lovely to return here feels like home from the moment we arrived we had a lovely greeting with champagne. Our room was as beautiful as always and those little touches still make a difference. The little gifts we get on the bed when you have a turn down are such a nice thought. The slippers are so comfy that is all we wear when In the hotel we have breakfast in them. Totally feel so relaxed and welcomed. We had chance this time to meet a lovely guy Stefan who works there. He was such a delight to have conversations with. A perfect gentleman. We stayed In one night and were planning our wedding Stefan made sure we were always topped up with a drink and nibbles. The staff there can not do enough for you. Perfect stunning place our…
June 2018,Why oh why oh why.......,......Can’t I award Hotel 41 six stars?  Once again Lauren and her team have excelled themselves. Absolutely nothing is too much trouble for them. A lovely surprise was the anniversary cake in our room.
June 2018,Family trip to London,"Unbelievable experience!  We have traveled to many, many places and stayed in some of the finest hotels and have never received as good of service as we experienced at Hotel 41.  The location and rooms were great but it is the staff that truly separates this hotel.  We highly recommend it!"
May 2018,Perfect in Every Way,"I have chosen to stay at Hotel 41 several times because the team makes me feel truly at home. I always refer to it as my home away from home.  From the moment I see the doorman in his stately uniform, the fabulous concierge to the minute I step onto the elevator I am transported to another world. A glamorous world filled with lots of beauty, joy, and heartfelt graciousness. Reception!.  From the first glass of champagne ( yes rose) to the lovely appetizers, chatting away with the lovely staff and guests who could ask for anything more....but there is more.  I had just returned from a visit to India which was not one of the finest trips I have taken and had returned with high anxiety and the staff were so kind to look after me as I had not slept in days and what a better night's…"
April 2018,Luxury hotel ,I enjoyed my stay over here with my family. City Centric so easy to reach other famous locations easily.  Nice ambiance.  Friendly service.  Easy to locate.  Free wifi. Hygiene room. Thank you management. 
April 2018,Great hotel!,"The service here is impeccable, although a little too personal for my taste. The breakfast was fresh and flawless, we never had a better breakfast in our lives! The rooms were great, the beds were very comfortable. The rooms were a litlle small and a bit chilly (heating was not working). Toilets were not flushing properly. But all in all a great stay."
November 2017,"Best hotel service, ever.","Physically, this hotel is an ordinary, somewhat dated, small luxury hotel. But the service is absolutely incredible. Better than the best in the world (Connaught/Claridge's/etc.).. Just one tiny example: during turndown service, they carefully tidied the dangling cords on my phone chargers with little Velcro cable wraps. Who DOES that? Just stellar."
June 2017,Fun Hotel in the London Area,"I traveled to London and stayed at the Hotel 41 during the summer time, it was beautiful and filled with amazing character.  The most incredible think about the hotel is it's historical charm and attention to detail."
April 2018,"Service, Service, Service","This is an incredibly nice hotel so you expect the room to be comfortable and clean, you expect a decent lounge, newspapers, coffee, tea, etc. I read about the service in other reviews, but until we stayed here it was hard to understand what a difference that can make on an international trip.  For someone who is used to taking care of everything this was actually a little difficult to get used to, for the first hour...... we asked about getting tickets to the Churchill War Room, sure they will be down in the lobby in a few minutes.  Great, that was easy, we walked up to the area and saw a very long line, no worries, we showed the paperwork to the gentleman directing people and he escorted us to the front of the line and let us in right away, wow didn’t expect that!! Dinner…"
March 2018,Whatever/Whenever,"Whatever/Whenever is more than just a label on the top button of the 41's room phones.  It is a philosophy that permeates their service culture.  I could write volumes on their impeccable attention to detail, their almost clairvoyant anticipation of your needs, and that mesmerizing aroma that perfumes the halls of the 41 with a woodsy cleanliness that's difficult to put in words.  Instead I'll share my experience where once again action speaks louder than words.  On a recent trip to London, my wife realized she had forgotten to pack our portable steam iron--an indispensable item for our upcoming cruise.  I pressed the W/W button to see if I could get some help finding a place where I could purchase one in London before our cruise the next day.  Meanwhile we went sightseeing…"
April 2018,Simply the Best,"In the words of Tina Turner, whose World Premiere Musical, ‘Tina,’  we were lucky enough to see in London....Hotel 41 is ‘Simply the Best’. The level of concierge service is above & beyond all expectations. It is rare that I remember the names of Hotel management but from Victoria & Nicole who I initially made contact with to Max & especially David,....I grew fond of them all. David was funny, completely authentic, knew lots about London, traveling & being adventurous. Before booking I thought the hotel might be a bit too formal for my taste but all involved Hotel 41 are very down to earth. They seemed genuinely interested in us as artists & made suggestions based on that.  The ‘ Executive Lounge’ is on the same floor (level 5) as the rooms. Both Hotel 41 and the Lounge have a…"
May 2017,One of the very best in the world,"Having stayed at various top-end hotels and read the raving reviews, my expectations were very high. And they were exceeded with grace and without hesitation. This is a very special place where it's all about the guest. I've come back several times and the staff never failed to deliver against the standards they set the first time. Don't tell anyone about this place so it can stay one of the best-kept secrets of London."
April 2018,Excellent Hotel for a Stay in London,"I would have to say this is one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed at.  The level of service provided by the staff is top notch and the facilities, food and level of customer care is unrivalled.  If you want to treat yourself book and stay here.  As an added benefit, the location in London is excellent for access to Victoria station and most of the attractions the City has to offer."
April 2018,A dream. ,"I’ve stayed in many a London hotel and I have to say that Hotel 41 is my favourite. Although pricey, you definitely get what you pay for and I had an amazing weekend alone, from the kids here. May make a habit of it! "
July 2018,Prepare to be Pampered,"The Hotel 41 is one of the finest hotels I have stayed in. The staff is universally excellent--friendly and helpful. From the welcome in the lobby to registration on the fifth floor, to the staff in the lounge, everyone was so pleasant and knowledgeable.  Stefan in the lounge offered us great advice in local museums and history and the lounge setting itself is very special. Sort of like having your own English club, with tasty dishes, snacks and drinks throughout the day and night.  Breakfast service as also outstanding with a wide variety of breakfast items for all tastes.  The hotel rooms are extremely well appointed, including virtually everything one needs for a restful stay. The rooms are quite spacious by London hotel standards and all very quiet, since they are on the…"
July 2018,Five star experience ,"The room was very comfortable, with every amenity. Staff were very attentive. There is a lounge where snacks, ice cream, and fruit are complimentary and available from morning to night.  The staff very kindly allowed my visiting family to use the lounge for an afternoon.  Couldn’t be better."
July 2018,There is simply no place better,"This boutique hotel is simply incredible.  I cannot list enough superlatives to describe its rooms, comfort, food and most of all the hospitality and staff.  From the minute you check in the staff makes you feel special and they truly want you to have a wonderful stay.  They helped us set up tours, rides, reservations for dinners and transportation to and from the airport..  In the Executive Lounge daily pantry snacks, drinks and even free dinner dishes are served lounge And is free.  Alex, Jonnais, and Jean Nicholas were just incredible to us during our stay.  The turn down service at night is just wonderful and you really feel special after a dinner or night activity with snacks, gifts and candles.  All the personalized service and touches make this place very special.  It was…"
July 2018,Sometimes perfection comes in the form of responding to challenges,"Let me start out by saying they people at Hotel 41 are top notch.  They will do whatever it takes to make your stay better and help you enjoy your time at the hotel and London.  Marlen was especially helpful in putting together a surprise for my wife upon arrival.  I had purchased Wimbledon tickets and wanted to surprise my wife.  Marlen procured a piece of astro-turf, tennis ball, strawberries and cream, Lanson Champagne and a card from my dictation and set it all up for us in the room.  It was perfect.  That perfection continued, but in a different way.  Our first night we didn't sleep too well.  I felt the room was noisy and the AC (thank goodness for it during a heatwave) was blowing directly on the bed.  I brought it to the staff's attention, and they sprung into action. …"
July 2018,"Whatever, Whenever","There is no place like 41.  We have been fortunate to stay several times in the last few years, including an 8 day 'friends and family' visit in 2016 during which we treated as such; friends and family.   41 is ideally located for those who like to explore on foot.  The hotel is across the street from the Royal Mews / Buckingham Palace. It is an easy 10 minute stroll to the Birdcage Walk and both St. James Park and Green Park are within 15 minutes as is Westminster Abbey.  Recently Nova Food has emerged across the street with a multitude of food and drink options which are handy as well if you are lucky enough to have theatre tickets for Hamilton; something we were able to secure through the hotel on our most recent visit.  41 is about service. We have established great…"
December 2017,Pure Luxury,"I got engaged in Hotel 41 so it definitely holds a special place in my heart anyway, but I don't think you could describe the hotel as anything other than pure luxury.  The rooms are super spacious given the location. All the staff go above and beyond and nothing is too big or small an issue for them to help with. I know Florent helped my now fiancé out a lot when planning the engagement surprise.   The little touches such as your glass of champagne on arrival, the ice cream available in the executive lounge and hot chocolate when headed out really added to our stay. The hotel is so grand and luxurious, in such a great location in London and just went above and beyond for us - I really hope we make it back in the near future to stay again. I would happily recommend this hotel to…"
June 2018,Impeccable hotel,"An absolute gem! Lovely atmosphere and amazing staff. Open pantry gives an extra value, especially when you travel alone, not too keen to spend every night eating out. Hotel location is super, close to parks, tourist attractions and public transportations.  Highly recommended! /Emilie A"
June 2018,Wonderful experience!,Large comfortable room with all of the amenities you would expect.  The huge difference is the staff who competently and quickly responded to our questions and needs.  They were so welcoming--yet professional--that we felt like we were staying with friends.  All of their suggestions were perfect for our needs.  Delicious treats with cocktails.  A freezer full of ice cream for your snacking any time.  The morning breakfasts were excellent.   Everything was great--and we will recommend the hotel to everyone.  Thanks.
July 2018,Amazing Discrete Hotel,We stayed a Saturday night and were very impressed.  Quite a discrete entrance as this hotel doesn’t shout like most properties for this luxury do.  The staff were fantastic and very helpful.  The interior is great and the rooms well furnished. 
July 2018,Fabulous Service,This warm and welcoming hotel was a dream! The staff are polite and extremely professional. Endless delightful food items are offered throughout the day complimentary to guests. The rooms are clean and the bed is comfortable. Fabulous stay!
November 2017,"Superb service,beautiful classic hotel "," We were travelling as honeymoon...We had 14 hours flight from HK to London. They are so jice to give us a temporary room for refreshments and rest! It’s so important after a long flight...location is good as It is easy to walk from Victoria Station to the Hotel...just about 5 mins...room size is good and beautiful, bathroom is classic! the most surprising is they sent a gift basket to another hotel on next day...as for apologise for a minor shortfall .... wow...even only some snacks...but this gesture really impressed us! So much thanks for all of your excellent service! Definitely will come back!  "
May 2018,Our perfect hideout,"Our regular business trips take us to 41.  We would stay nowhere else.  On this occasion we returned to The Curry Room situated downstairs through the bar in The Rubens, which was every bit as good as we remembered and no getting wet or trying to find a taxi in the rain.  If you really enjoy an authentic curry, have a look at the menu.  This is as good as it gets.  Service and knowledge impeccable and curries full of flavour rather than just mouth-cringing heat.  This is not what it is about.  My husband had the pork vindaloo (choice of pork or beef) whilst I had the Natal lamb, both of which were splendid.  All but one table was occupied by the time we left at 9pm, and the place hums with enthusiasm from both guests and staff.  The Curry Room pleasingly offers exceptional value…"
April 2018,Real Luxury,"Staying in this hotel was like being on a luxury cruise - the service was impeccable and personal, the beds were comfortable, the linens fine, and there was some type of food available in the kitchen all the time. My personal pet peeve in hotels is the quality of their towels.  I love big and fluffy towels, which I rarely get in hotels; but here, they were huge, and lush. On our last night in London, my husband and I went to see Hamilton.  We were very excited and told one of the stuff about that.  When we came back after the show, we found macaroons with Hamilton insignia imprinted on them, a red rose, and rose petals strewed all over the room!  I mean, I have never....!!!!!"
May 2018,A wonderful stay in a fabulous hotel,"One again everything was fabulous, beautiful spacious rooms, very friendly approachable staff, who go out of their way to make sure you have a wonderful time at Hotel 41. lots of little extras such as champagne on arrival, chocolates in room, fresh fruit, ice cream, sweets and treats in the afternoon, pillow menu and many other wonderful little touches. The beds are divine, spacious and so comfortable. Our family joined us in the evening for drinks and were made to feel very welcome by staff."
May 2018,Just as expected!,"Located in the heart of London near the victoria station and the Buckingham Palace, the 41 is an outstanding hotel. The hotel is perfectly run by a group of polite and extremely motivated staff. Clearly the employees love what they do and take care of the needs of the guests diligently. The rooms are spacious and clean, there are personal touches that make the stay very pleasant. I will be returning to this property with my family because there is such a homey feeling and my parents will certainly enjoy the personal touch and the superb social areas. There are many perks included."
May 2018,Perfect Hotel for a London Break,"Our experience at the Hotel 41 was absolutely perfect. I wanted to find a special place to celebrate my Wife's 60th birthday and this hotel certainly ticked all the boxes. From the moment we stepped into the building we were made to feel like we were the only guests in the place. The interior design is stunning and impeccably decorated throughout. It feels more like a home than a hotel, and the layout is perfect for a restful stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and took time to chat to us throughout our stay which is something I've never experienced before. The room was bright and clean, with so many thoughtful touches we wanted for nothing throughout our 2-day stay. I can easily understand why this hotel is currently the number 1 hotel in London, it is a perfect…"
April 2018,Superb Experience,"From entering to leaving, it was a superb experience, the staff were extremely helpful and the room in great condition.  We could not have happasked for more.  The room itself was well sized and perfect for our occasion."
May 2018,Like being in the Kingsman movie!  A private entrance to an private club feel.,"The 41 is an eclectic blend of English library and private club. The staff is as pleasant and helpful as you can hope for in a hotel.  We had a 5 night stay with a quiet, bright and spacious room.  This 5th floor hotel is well appointed and tastefully decorated.  The tones for the room are white with black accents.  Maintaining an old English flair with modern amenities in lighting, gas fireplace, and marble bathroom.  The Executive lounge is a high ceiling library with several tables and couches well situated to provide private conversation but giving the opportunity to meet other guests if desired.  The breakfast service is excellent, either a continental buffet or ordered hot items from the menu.  Raiding the pantry in the evening became a regular habit along with a perfectly…"
March 2018,Delightful Stay/Exquisite service,"Trip to Ireland was canceled at last second because of bad weather, and we needed a hotel at the last second since we were staying in London. Had read about Hotel 41, decided to give it a try,  and was not dissapointed! From the arrival thru checkin we felt like we were family - the room was a 2 floor suite, with old world touches. Each night the beds were warmed with a hot water bottle! One of my travel companions commented on checkin about the name badges, and within an hour one was custom made and delivered to his room. This is the type of personal service that they offered. It was nice to be recognized and greeted by name each time.  One of the highlights was the Executive lounge where you checked in, with complimentary champagne. It was also always open. We had a delightful…"
May 2018,Wonderful and outstanding Hotel,"We recently stayed at Hotel No 41 for our wedding anniversary. Everything was perfect from our greeting by Max at the front door, to our welcome champagne on check in. The suite was beautifully decorated, the bedroomwas on a mezzanine level and was well equipped. All the staff worked seemlessly to ensure each customer recieved impeccable customer service and strived to maintain high standards. Thankyou for making our stay very special and very enjoyable."
June 2018,Made our honeymoon ,Trust is the word to use when it comes to the 41 hotel. We decided to stay there for our honeymoon and it was the best choice we could make! My new wife has coeliac disease so everything has to be gluten free. They also baked gluten free buns and brownies specially for her. The staff are beyond professional and incredibly helpful. Check in was quick and effortless. Room was immaculate. Breakfast was divine and they make one of the finest martini’s in London. Hotel 41 is the only place we will pay for when visiting London again. 
May 2018,Excellent Experience from Start to Finish,"Beautiful Hotel with service that is the best. The staff is helpful, the rooms were immaculate, and the lounge area was certainly a big plus after a night with the Rolling Stones. The concierge and staff could not have been more helpful day and night. This place is a destination, not just a hotel."
March 2018,A Master Class in Hotel Service,"My husband and I stayed at 41 Hotel in March for a short getaway.  It would be easy to walk past it -- next to the Ruebens with a sign that says Residents Only next to the door.  The hotel facilities are charmingly British-feeling, with a wood-paneled lounge and all the accoutrements.  Staff couldn't have been more helpful as we focused on seeing things we hadn't seen on previous trips.  We especially appreciated Steven Jones (Steve as he introduced himself ""in American""!) in the lounge, who walked us through high tea and knowledgeably discussed the Modigliani exhibition at the Tate Modern that we had enjoyed that day.  My husband spent lots of time in the lounge for breakfast each morning (coddled cream!) while I enjoyed lazing in the room, which was an Executive King --…"
June 2018,The best hotel,"From the moment we stepped inside, everything was great! The staff, the executive lounge, the champagne, the room, the food, the snacks... It was just a wonderful experience from beginning to end. Our choice of hotel whenever we visit London in the future."
May 2018,Wonderful,"My husband and I stayed her for 3 days and wished it could have been more. The room was beautiful as well as comfortable. The lounge area offered snacks and drinks all day and if there is anything you want to know about wine just talk to Stefan. The hotel  staff were friendly and helpful, even printing out all the Harry Potter locations throughout the city. The hotel is in a perfect area of the city, easy to walk to many places or take the tube or bus if you don't like to walk. Will return to Hotel41 when we are in London again."
June 2018,5 Star service,"We stayed for 1 night during our long birthday weekend in London; the hotel is quite hidden on the Main Street, very close to Buckingham palace. We were greeted by the doorman and then we were shown to the lift which takes you up to the main reception and lounge area.  The entrance is very grand and breathtaking; the staff on reception were very welcoming, and we were offered a glass of champagne on arrival.  Our room was very luxurious, but homely; the bed was comfortable. We had chocolates and a birthday cake in the room, which was a lovely surprise. The room had tea and coffee making facilities, bath robe /slippers, safe, toiletries and water and Sky tv.  The lounge area (also where reception is) is very cosy, with air conditioning and various complimentary snacks are…"
May 2018,2nd visit amazing again,2nd visit and it was perfection again . Upgraded into a suite awesome .  NOTHING is too much trouble and they are so generous with everything all of which is complimentary unlike so many 5 star hotel who charge you for everything . The staff are the stars of the show . Just delightful in every way . The only thing i would say is that if you like ultra modern then this hotel might not be for you . Otherwise just go and be blown away by the experience
June 2018,Believe the Hype!,"Hotel 41 has elevated my expectations in what to expect from a luxury boutique hotel. The Executive Lounge is one of the most beautiful, yet comfortable and welcoming places to relax. The delicious canapes, abundant snack bar and even the ""honor"" bar made it easy to enjoy an afternoon curled up into a comfy couch with a good book. The staff was simply incredible and big kudos to creating a great experience! From the front desk and concierge team: David, Mitchell, Marlen, Victoria, Max, and Lauren to the Executive Lounge staff: Stefon, Alex, Armin, and Marcelo, they are the heart and soul that makes Hotel 41 worth the stay. (Super big thanks to David for shipping artwork I left behind!) I'd also like to extend a thank you to the sister hotel, Rubens' Doormen, Aaron and Stuart.…"
June 2018,Best in London,"This is like going to an exclusive club. We returned last week after a couple of years. Service is second to none. There are no weak employees. They are all great, The rooms are spotless. The only thing lacking is a gym but I am sure they will find one for you if needed and maybe even exercise for you if you ask. The private lounge is always stocked with food. You really could just eat there all the time. No reasson not to give 5 stars."
May 2018,I'd say they deserve their #1 Tripadvisor ranking,"Beautiful place. Excellent service. The Executive lounge, open to all 30 rooms, is amazing. The living room of an amazing mansion.  Check in is seated across a table there. Everyone is so friendly that I saw guest after guest plop back down at the table when they came into the lounge. Drinks and snacks are always available. I don't drink but their champagne cart looked amazing. Several brands for the asking. Staff was legitimately concerned with everyone's day to day tourist activity. Couldn't be a better location, across from the Royal Mews and a block from Victoria Station. It's next door th The Rubens, with which it shares services. It's actually attached, you can go from one to the other through a nondescript passage.  Expensive but half-price compared to the Savoy or…"
May 2018,Wonderful Staff and Hotel!,"This is one of the most beautiful hotels I have stayed. They leave nothing to chance. They are one step ahead of any need a guest may have. The hotel transports to an era when elegance was the norm. The staff is highly motivated and go out of their way to help you in any way they can, everyone at the hotel I came across  was absolutely great. I visited London and Edinburgh, but this hotel was truly the highlight of the whole trip. The location is very convenient since is near Victoria Station and the Palace. The smell near the elevators was one of the best things I have sensed. The rooms were second to none. Enjoyed the daily fruit at the room. Thank you for your generosity and attention to detail."
May 2018,Home from Home,"Over 2000 excellent reviews and a number one rating on tripadvisor is very well deserved indeed!   Hotel 41 is all about customer service and the small details, from the moment you walk through the door, every detail is perfect in every way! Check in with a glass of champagne as your luggage is taken to your room and enjoy some treats in the beautiful executive lounge before discovering your lovely room.  We were delighted to find a compimentary bottle of champagne on ice along with handmand chocolates and a selection of fresh fruit.  The staff at 41 really go the extra mile to make sure that your experience exceeeds your expectations at every opportunity in a way that makes you really feel like you are home away from home. ""Plunder the pantry is a must.""  We would like to also…"
May 2018,Better than expected,"I had never stayed in a small boutique hotel, but now I am hooked. Hotel 41 is elegant,  intimate and friendly.  We felt as though we were visiting dear friends who told their staff to treat us like family. Food and drink are available all day in the lounge and, after one day, they knew our preferences. The staff is superb. We loved coming ""home"" after a busy day of sight-seeing and shopping or an evening at theater to relax in the lounge with a snack and a drink. As I expected, the rooms are a little small, but beautifully appointed.  The location, right across from Buckingham Palace, is so convenient.  We could walk almost anywhere. I highly recommend Hotel 41."
May 2018,Lovely rooms,"Absolutely Nice and clean room&bathroom, we liked the luxury design with my husband. The breakfast was really tasty I had sirloin steak my husband had a salmon. We'll go back soon again thank you for the experience"
May 2018,Breathtakingly wonderful,"A small corner of insanely luxurious tranquility, just a minute’s walk from Victoria Underground Station. It seems impossible to believe that this is central London. The place is absolutely spotless, no mean feat for an older building with much wood panelling and lots of old books lining the walls. Everyone knows your name as soon as you walk through the door and nothing is too much trouble. I especially loved the ‘Whatever, whenever’ button on the phone!  We were here for a ‘big’ wedding anniversary, mentioned it in the booking and were treated like royalty the whole time we were there. My only regret is that we had just one night. We will most definitely be heading back to our newly found London bolt hole.   Many thanks to the incredible staff who made our stay from 28-29 May…"
May 2018,Simply the best...,"41 is no doubt the best establishment that we have stayed in London by far – and we have stayed in many 5 star hotels believe me during our various weekends away in London. I wanted to find a special treat for my partner’s birthday and seeing Wicked was amazing but staying at 41 was ‘the icing on the cake’.  The attention to detail and the attentiveness of the staff surpassed our expectations and it was actually a joy to spend time in the Executive Lounge as it was so perfect – the staff just knew when to attend and also when to leave alone – all very satisfying.  Many thanks to Lauren, Marlen, the Doormen, the Executive Lounge staff, etc for the best experience of our lives in London so far. I think this will be difficult to top.  We hope to see you all soon in not the distant…"
May 2018,Absolutely wonderful!,"From the minute we walked into Hotel 41, we knew this was going to be an extraordinary hotel and we were correct. We arrived in London fairly early and even though check-in was not until the afternoon, they promised our room would be ready shortly and invited us to use another room to shower/freshen up/nap while we waited. The check in process with complimentary champagne was a nice touch.   We had booked a split level junior suite and it was gorgeous. The layout worked very well for us and it was so spacious. The bathroom had a huge soaking tub and separate shower.   The service at this hotel really sets it apart. Everyone went out of their way to make sure we didn't need or want for anything during our stay. We were here for 3 nights and I cannot think of one negative during…"
May 2018,Exceptional service and attention to detail,I have stayed at many of the best hotels around the world and the team at 41 provide the sort of personalised service and attention to detail that puts them right up there with the best in class. The kindness shown to myself and my wife really made our stay at 41 an experience rather than just a night spent in yet another luxury hotel.
April 2018,"Second visit, equally as perfect as before","We returned to Hotel 41 whilst in London to celebrate my wife's birthday. This was our second visit and was as perfect as the first (2 years ago). The Hotel team are fantastic, nothing is too much effort, and without even mentioning it, they knew it was my wife's birthday (checked from our previous visit) and made our stay even more special. I cannot fault this hotel, from the moment you step in until the minute you leave you are made to feel special. Will certainly return again."
April 2018,Nice place to stay ,I was stayed there for one night only.  The hotel is really  so beautiful and look like old. Very well decorated with  nice food. Service is really top of the noche staff is very courteous and attentive.. Hotel location is prime.. Nice place to stay here.. 
October 2017,Best of the best,"Perfect location, one of the best hotels I have ever been to . The staff is friendly, good looking and well trained! We had maybe the best Beef Wellington we ever tried and despite the high rates we will definetely return back here! Cheers to John, Liza and Pawel for everything!"
July 2018,Am I too old to say OMG!?,"Third visit to Hotel41 and I still get goose bumps thinking about it.   Not sure that there is anything else to say that hasn’t already be said. This place is simply perfect. Yes it is expensive but worth every single penny because of the way you are treated and the attention to detail that is given to every aspect of the visit.  My suggestion is as follows. Stop reading the reviews and just book. Go! Take the significant other in your life, pack a bag and get there.  Thank you Hotel41. For everything. See you for visit number 4 some time in 2019."
July 2018,Sublime,It's hard to know where to begin with this review. With a heavy heart I have just returned back to the 'real world' of my own home and the daily grind of real life and work. The office is looming ominously for me in the morning yet my mind is a million miles away from it: I'm reflecting so fondly over the last 24 hours during my all to brief stay at Hotel 41.   I still smell sweetly of the Penhaligons products supplied. I wanted to take them all home with me but I resisted the temptation. I also wanted to take away the monogrammed soft fluffy towels. And the sheets. And even just one of the pillows from the huge pillow menu. And the robes. And the slippers. And even the unique piped fragrance throughout the hotel (which I believe I'll be able to in a few months time I'm told as…
May 2018,Favorite hotel in London,Great location with an excellent and attentive staff. The rooms are lovely and was delighted by the daily snacks - what a nice surprise. Every detail is carefully thought out. We look forward to our next visit!
July 2018,Simply exquisite ,"This is an exceptional hotel. It has really earned its top ranking on multiple sites. It is   Boutique with only 28 rooms, situated within walking distance of Buckingham palace, Westminster Cathedral and Victoria station. The small extra you pay here compared to other hotels in the area is worth the high level of service and comfort offered.  We were greeted at the door and taken to the executive lounge to check in. Instead of the usual check in desk, we sat down in the lounge where we were offered our choice of champagnes. In the executive lounge there is a selection of complimentary snacks throughout the day. They even offer ice cream. The room was luxurious, clean and comfortable. All food and drinks we had were great.  The attention to detail by all of the staff was…"
June 2018,A wonderful stay at a wonderful hotel!!,"I had seen this hotel in TripAdvisor and had  always wanted to visit!! My mum and I decided to stay as a joint Christmas and birthday present and we were not disappointed!! We were greeted at the door and waited for someone to show us up to the fifth floor where the main of the hotel is located. When we arrived on the correct floor we were taken to the Executive Lounge to check in. We were welcomed with a lovely glass of champagne whilst we filled out the details needed which was a lovely way to begin our stay!! Following this we were shown to our room which was delightful!! I love the black and white theme that runs through the hotel and the room was perfect!! Not large, but perfect for what we wanted!! Lovely comfortable twin beds, writing desk, sofa and tv area and a…"
July 2018,Exceptional everything during our third stay at Hotel 41,"I cannot fathom coming to London and staying anywhere else. Hotel 41 is beautiful, the food and cocktails incredibly delicious and the delightful staff helped with all our bookings and coordinated drivers for our party of four. I had a snafu in which tickets had to be picked up and there was no way for us to physically make it by before the event. Hotel 41 arranged for someone to pick them up. We were introduced to what is now our favorite new gin cocktail, made with Gin Mare, a rosemary sprig and two Spanish olives by Steve. Another gentleman on staff, Steph, recommended a straight razor shave and place to get one for the guys that they thoroughly enjoyed. I will be back as soon as I can! Thanks for all Hotel 41!!!"
July 2018,Out of this world!,"From arrival to leaving we have never felt so well looked after nor spoilt in any hotel.  Upon arrival we were greeted by a really friendly young man in the lobby, who seemed genuinely interested in making us feel comfortable and relaxed. The lobby has snacks and drinks that are there to refresh you on arrival and departure. We were then taken up to the 5th floor lounge to check in. Stefan brought over a selection of champagned and made a great recommendation for me to try (as I have no clue nor a distinguished palette).  We were a little early so we were offered some canapes (cheese straws, egg dip and olives) with our drinks whilst we relaxed in the lounge.  The lounge has a mini freezer with around 12 different flavours of Jude's ice cream that you can help yourself to…"
July 2018,Wow,"Brilliant from the minute you step through the door. Very welcoming staff (glass of champagne, anyone?) and the hotel itself is beautifully quirky. We didn’t make the most of the (free) ice-cream bar so that’s my excuse to go back."
June 2018,Just Wonderful,"An Unforgettable experience, Never felt like a hotel ,more like an exclusive club. Staff went beyond expectations and made our 2 day stay even more pleasant. I would highly recommend this hotel to all "
November 2017,World class service,We travel a lot & this hotel has never failed to impress us with its outstanding service.  Sharing a recent experience- The staff were exceptionally courteous & helpful. Even the smallest requirements of each & every guests were taken care of which is really commendable.  I strongly recommend this hotel.
April 2018,Not as nice,We are sad that we stayed in this hotel as the last hotel on our trip to England and France because we will not remember it as nicely as the hotels that we stayed in. The biggest thing is for us is that the people the hotel is employing are not like in the other hotels. On our journey at this hotel we did not feel as though people wanted to take care of us in the same way and that we make problems for them by being in the hotel. The staffs were not always present and attentive to what you needs and that made it difficult. It did not feel as professional a hotel and I think we had expected more form a English luxury hotel in London.
December 2017,Excellent stay on Christmas Eve,I had an excellent stay here this past Christmas Eve.  It was my second time at the hotel and it was just as good as I had remembered.  The staff even left stockings filled with nice little items on all the doors for guests to discover on Christmas.  I definitely plan to stay here again the next time I am in London.
March 2018,"Great staff, great location","This hotel is unusual in many ways. For one, it consists of one single floor, accessed from a street-level elevator, from a separate door next to the entrance to The Rubens. The hotel’s interior is quiet, despite its location near Buckingham Palace. But keep the windows closed to keep out the traffic noise!  The room-temperature controls are very good.   The location is excellent, a short walk from Harrod’s, Hyde Park, and Westminster Abbey. The street is not as busy as it is in Mayfair, near the Dorchester or Claridges. Plenty of taxis pass by. Our split-level “suite” had a big bed, skylights, and a big bathroom.   The staff were consistently polite and helpful. Our special thanks to Mr. Jones and to Greg and Armand in the Executive lounge, and to David for his cheerful…"
April 2018,Outsanding boutique hotel -- one of the best!,"This is the best city hotel we have ever stayed in, through many years of travel. We love the boutique size and the extraordinary personalized attention. The concept of the executive lounge is so appealing that we are surprised it's not a model found in other fine boutique hotels. We spent much time in the lounge, savoring the tasty food and drinks, and always felt welcomed and comfortable. The staff went out of their way to accommodate our every need and to anticipate ones we didn't even know we had. The location is excellent, and it's easy to get anywhere in London from the hotel. It is pricey but worth every penny. We can't wait to return."
April 2018,Great ’private club -like’ 5 star boutigue hotel,"Amazing service. Feels like a private club with attention to smallest details. Simply great, especially if you look for something more personal & different than big hotels chains. Breakfast was awesome and served until 11, thus you can make it almost like an early lunch. "
February 2018,Wedding anniversary stay,We had a lovely stay here for our wedding anniversary. As it was a special occasion they upgraded our room and surprised us with a cake. The level of customer service is excellent and the rooms very tastefully furnished. The refreshments on offer in the lounge area are very good quality and it was a very nice place to chill out after a busy day in London.
April 2018,50th Birthday Celebrations in the Conservatory Suite,"I originally booked Hotel 41 nearly 10 months before my 50th Birthday purely on recommendation of Tripadvisor (being No 1 in London) and I was not disappointed in the least.  After my booking I did ""pop"" in to check the layout of the Conservatory Suite as I was going to use it as not only for accommodation but as a base for several ""drink parties"" during my stay (3 days).  The Conservatory Suite is split on two levels with downstairs seating for at least (4/5 if you include the stairs) and on the upper level seating for at least 7/8. I was pleasantly surprised I was able to bring my own bottles of wine/drinks with me and they even suggested emptying the mini bar prior to my arrival to accommodate!   I had pre-ordered Afternoon Tea for Sunday in the Board Room for 8 (offered free…"
April 2018,Home away from home,"Where to begin? Our family of four recently spent 7 nights in Hotel 41. From the moment we entered the hotel to the moment we left, we were treated like family. The personalized service was like nothing we had ever experienced. Within a day, the entire staff knew all of ours names and were constantly ahead of each planned moment of our trip. Some might find this overkill, but we found this level of concierge service to be extremely helpful to us as we navigated the city of London as well several countryside towns. Train tickets, restaurant suggestions, reservations, taxi service, snacks and lunches for longer  day trips...always with a warm smile. Anytime we were away from Hotel 41 for the day and trying to figure out how to manage our evening, we always found ourselves saying,…"
April 2018,Exquisite Hotel,"It seems that we are in good company as fans of The 41. Everything about this jewel box of a boutique hotel was perfect. Others have described the comfortable rooms, thick towels on hot towel racks (also excellent for drying hand laundry), delicious snacks, and beautiful spaces. The old board room AKA the Lounge is so classically British that we smiled each time we entered. The management clearly knows that their most important asset is the staff, and they are wonderful. Thank you."
June 2017,Truly the ultimate example of British class and service,"My wife and I have stayed here a few times, and it is always exquisite. We will be staying there again in 4 weeks. The last time we stayed we were rushing into the UK on business. We arrived late-morning as usual, exhausted and travel-burnt. We had to be smart and back on top by dinner. The hotel coordinated our ride in, as usual they had precisely the pillows, bedding and flowers we like in the room and best of all coordinated 2 masseuses for a couples-massage just after we arrived. I can't overstate how much we enjoy the people that work there, the way they take care of customers or the class with which they behave. Our upcoming trip will be our first all-pleasure stay, as we break journey for a few days before continuing east. I can honestly say that staying there, regardless…"
March 2018,Heaven on Earth,"I didn't want to leave. This place is great: location, attentive staff, relaxing lounge, beautiful room with deep soaking tub, and champagne offered upon arrival. You must stay here at least once in your life to treat yourself. One word: awesome."
March 2018,Truly luxurious hotel,"Over the last few years we have stayed on 3 occasions and each time found the hotel to live up to the high standards we have learnt to expect. The hotel itself is extremely comfortable and well appointed and maintained, but the excellent staff make the experience a real treat. They are very attentive but remain relaxed and put us at ease."
July 2017,Late entry but truly 5 star service and accommodation!,"This review is late, but better late than never! We stayed one year ago at Hotel 41, July 3-5, 2017. I had originally booked a different property, but with the terrorist attack one month earlier, approximately, at that time, I moved hotels to what I considered to be a safer venue. We booked 2 rooms, one for my husband and I, the second for our teenage kids. The hotel is about 2 blocks from Buckingham Palace :)  When we arrived, we were greeted by name. We were escorted to the lounge area and the set up was explained. We also were offered our choice of one of 3 different champagnes to choose from! Fantastic start! We checked into our rooms then went out enjoy the sights. One of the staff told us Kings Cross station had an actual Harry Potter store and also had platform 9 3/4 and…"
March 2018,Exceptional,"The whole experience from the moment you enter the building is exceptional. The care, attention to detail and personalised service is delivered by their many members of staff in such an unobtrusive, genuine fashion that you feel comfortable and valued with every interaction - they make it seem so easy!  Our stay at Hotel 41 has become the benchmark by which we will now judge any future luxury hotel experience. Outstanding."
November 2017,Nice,"Enjoyed a weekend away, clean and all staff was friendly. Would definitely go again and recommend. Location is also very good, enjoyed our breakfast for the price it’s what I expected thank you for great service"
March 2018,Fabulous!!!,"Hotel 41 is truly a five star hotel, it  deserves it's accolade of the best hotel in the UK. The service is impeccable but not obtrusive, all requests are dealt with efficiently and with a smile! I found the extra touches and the attention to detail throughout amazing, it made my two night stay absolutely perfect.....................I can't remember when I last had a hot water bottle tucked in my bed, but it was oh so welcoming!  Thank you for a memorable stay and I hope to return very soon."
March 2018,Exceeded its lofty expectations,"Hotel 41 delivers on its promise! From the moment we checked in, we knew we made the right decision. Every single aspect of our stay was perfect! The location can't be beat, and the staff went above and beyond to ensure that everything was perfect at all times.   The centerpiece is of course the living room - which was always well-stocked with snacks, and had an fantastic bar menu. The breakfast selection was fantastic, and food was prepared to order with our preferences in mind.   The room is a bit on the small side, so we only did breakfast in our room the first day. Other than that, it was a perfect and cozy room, and the shower had epic water pressure which is always a welcome perk!   I can't wait to tell my friends and family about Hotel 41, and hope they stay there soon so…"
February 2018,Amazing but we had a noisy room...,From the beginning to the end perfect. Such a beautiful and special place to stay! Etremely friendly staff. Love the fireplace in the rooms.  Only one thing: by email we asked some days before arrival for the most quit rooms as I am a very light sleeper. They confirmed that they would make sure we would get a quit room and I was so happy.  Unfortunatelly we were situated beneath the special masterroom upstairs and the person who stayed there obviously was jetlagged or whatever. The up and on walking on an old wooden floor made such a sound that I was awake almost the whole night... The day after we moved to other rooms and they were perfect. However one of the staff members told me that he had his doubts before putting us in our previous room and thought that our second room is…
March 2018,*Almost* perfect service...,"We stayed in the conservatory suite for a couple of nights and our overall experience was excellent. For such a small hotel I can just imagine how difficult it would be to hire and maintain such a well trained staff that truly understands and provide luxury service. There were a couple of teeny service quibbles (including one bigger one our departure) that I will detail later. They will seem very minor but at well over a grand a night, things need to be 100 percent. For these issues I scrooged and only gave 4 out of 5 rating (I wish TA would allow half stars so i could give 4.5). We pulled up in a rental car. The hotel sits on a very busy road (Buck Palace Rd) that is ""redlined"" which means absolutely no stopping (unless you're a bus or taxi)...and there is nowhere at all to…"
March 2018,Excellent hotel,"Stayed at Hotel 41 for one night during business trip. Impeccable service, personal attention, classy surroundings, clean and well equipped room;- all  facilitated to make the stay comfortable and memorable. Probably one of the best hotels in London. "
February 2018,"Excellent Hotel, Upscale and Mature","My wife and I stayed here for two nights in February and it was one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed in.  The hotel centers around an Executive Lounge and the activities, including checking in, breakfast and the entire food service center around this lounge.  The rooms have the best amenities and are a good size for a city like London.  Service is what you would expect from a hotel like this one.  Everyone we came in contact with was very helpful.  The free food in Executive Lounge is a nice treat, particularly after seeing a show."
March 2018,Quite simply the best,"My husband and I stayed here one night prior to flying out from Gatwick to the Maldives and again on the return leg of our journey from North Yorkshire. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. From the moment you enter the hotel you are in the hands of the most efficient, friendly, and professional  hotel staff I have ever encountered.  On the outbound journey we stayed in an executive room which was excellent and on our inbound journey we were upgraded to a junior suite. It was unexpected but what a treat. This room on a split level was absolutely fantastic.  Regarding food, we had breakfast on both occasions and were both very pleased with our full English and eggs benedict respectively. We also had a chance to ‘plunder the pantry’ in the lounge. It was excellent in the…"
February 2018,What a Find!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at 41 in every aspect.  From the minute we walked through the entrance and were welcomed with warmth and respect to the time we sadly had to leave, this hotel and its staff impressed us with professionalism and forethought.  Although the spaces (entrance, passages, rooms, bathrooms) are not large, the superb black and white decor makes up for it with attention to detail and interest.  The convivial business lounge, which is the hub of the establishment and which is operative from early morning until late every night, has been cleverly laid out into private seating areas suitable for breakfast, teas, snacks, drinks, late night foraging or just reading the newspaper.  Such a clever concept.  Here you can help yourself to drinks and an array of…"
March 2018,Ladies and Gentlemen serving Ladies and Gentlemen!,"Myself and my wife have stayed here a few times and without exception it is the best hotel to stay in whilst in London. A real unique home from home experience, put simply we love it!  All staff are exceptional, a special mention to Steve and Dean for the way they looked after us.  We will return soon I am sure."
February 2018,Fantastic Holiday,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying here on a recent trip to London. We could not recommend the hotel more. The location was fanatic and the staff, sublime. We were warmly welcomed and shown to our room, despite arriving at 9:00 am. The restaurant recommendations from the staff surpassed our expectations. We hope to return on future trips."
February 2018,Returning Home,"This is my daughter and my fourth stay at the Hotel 41 and will certainly not be our last. Based on our experience, we can honestly say that the consistently amazing customer service at the Hotel 41 doesn't happen by accident. It happens on purpose! The Hotel 41 staff goes to great lengths to make sure you feel like invited guests to a party and they are the hosts. From the front desk staff to the wait staff to the housekeeping staff...an experience is created that's worth talking about to other travelers and not easily forgotten. I certainly will not forget the congratulatory card for my daughter's engagement, or the thoughtful tokens left by Lukas to make my trip to Kensington Palace all the more special, or the tea tray sent to my room with a lovely note from Mitchell after a…"
March 2018,Exceptional boutique hotel,We stayed here for 2 nights and highly enjoyed every detail. From check in to check out the staff were excellent and treated us like royalty. The hotel is small and expensive but worth it for very special occasions.  The decor and style is very luxurious and the rooms are amazing. Food is delicious and staff are amazing. We will be back and recommend highly for others to stay here. 
February 2018,Birthday bliss,"My husband and I stayed here for my birthday after having had it recommended to us by a friend..  From the very 1st welcome, to the helpfulness with taxis and directions to the swift easy checkout nothing was too much trouble for any member of the staff.   we were made to feel that nothing was too much trouble ..  And the little extra touches the hotel provided were what makes this hotel  a cut above some others. Our room,the food and the service were all amazing and we wouldn’t hesitate to return."
March 2018,Customer service defined!,"From the very moment that you enter, the staff is completed dedicated to your experience. The rooms are tastefully done with little extras like chocolates and lavender spray at turndown service. Fruit is always present in your room. This is strictly boutique! You could walk right past it if you didn't know what you were looking for. Thank you Victoria for helping us with our luggage situation!!! She was making calls for us 8 hours after we had checked out!"
February 2018,What a find-sublime,"Tucked away and barely noticeable next to Reuben's hotel is the 41 Hotel in Buckingham Palace road, number 41. A delightful boutique hotel  of 28 rooms and part of the red carnation group that has hotels like the Oyster box in Umhalanga rocks South Africa and the 7 Apostles hotel in Capetown-top of the range 5 star hotels -as is the 41. The attention to detail is brilliant, from a glass of champers when you check in  in the lounge, to the handwritten note from the hotels manager welcoming you. The rooms are not huge but well appointed with great amenities. The bed is divine and one could just sleep an entire vacation away . The decor is warm, black and white tiles, wood, black and white warm upholstery , thick curtains that do block out the light  and little goodies that just…"
March 2018,Sheer perfection from arrival to departure ,"My husband and I have just recently returned from a one night stay here and it was perfect! We chose this hotel due to its outstanding reviews and boy, they weren’t wrong. The customer service shown to us by everyone we encountered at the hotel was second to none. From Nicole’s beaming smile with an offer of a freshly made hot chocolate when we arrived, to Max who showed us up to the Executive Lounge and the wonderfully kind Florent who checked us in, everyone was delightful and literally could not do enough to help us.   Aside from being wonderfully located near Victoria stations, this hotel happily goes the extra mile to make everything special for its guests. On arrival we were informed that we had been upgraded to the Balmoral Suite which was a most unexpected, but extremely…"
February 2018,Exquisite and so British !,"Everything was perfect, from the room to the people with all the little details that make your stay unforgetable. The hotel is very central (located nearby Victoria station) and 5mn by feet from Buckingham Palace."
December 2017,Best in class,"My wife and I stayed in London for 10 days to celebrate Christmas and her birthday. It was my job to pick the hotel. After extensive research, I picked Hotel 41. To say that this establishment is amazing would be a complete understatement. The most attentive, friendly, accommodating staff we have ever experienced. We stayed in a couple of different rooms(by choice) and they were terrific. I would like to give special attention to a few of the staff. Lukas, Adele and Florent who helped with the original reservation. Thank you Hotel 41 for such a wonderful experience "
February 2018,The best ever!,"Thank you everyone at 41 Hotel for making my stay just perfect. It‘s a real home away from home - which welcomes you after a long day in the city. Besides the super friendly and relaxed staff, the evening turndown completed a perfect week in a perfect hotel. "
February 2018,Message to The Ritz Hotel - Please take notes...,"Reservation made via Expedia Room Type - Executive Room, 1 King Bed Breakfast included Room Number - 4106 Duration: 1 night (14th February 2018)  We experienced the magic that is Hotel 41 for the first time for one night as part of our honeymoon.    The welcome to the hotel can only be described as simply outstanding.  Lucas at the concierge desk was the first point of contact. Immaculately dressed, he welcomed us as if we were family members.  After taking our details, we explained we unfortunately missed our  Hard Rock Cafe reservation due to traffic delays.  He said he would contact Hard Rock to see if the reservation could be honoured despite being nearly 1 hour late.    We were taken to the Executive Lounge to officially check in.  As the reservation had already been…"
February 2018,Wow Memories that will last forever!,"Stayed here as treat for 40th birthday on febuary 20th and I have to say I really didn't want to go home! From the moment we arrived we knew this was a special place we were taken straight to the executive lounge and provided with a glass of champagne whilst checking in, the lounge was so relaxing and the staff were all amazing whilst there having a drink you are given snacks complementary as well as there being a complementary snack bar to help yourself and including icecreams! We were then shown to our room and I would personally like to thank hotel 41 for the upgrade to the suite which really made my birthday!!! It had everything you could possibly need and more! Even down to the little things like in the mini bar were the drinks we had in the bar! I would never in my dreams…"
February 2018,#1 Hotel in London and will make your trip amazing!!,"We love to visit London and stay at Hotel 41 each trip. I can honestly say that the people of Hotel 41 actually make our trips so much more special with their high attention to detail, friendly service, immaculate property and fun extras. There is nowhere else you should stay when visiting the city (it's top of 1000's of properties for a reason and has been for years).    We were in town for a combo business/ The Crown post binge watch tour. The property is across the street from Buckingham Palace and the Royal Mews. St James Park, the Churchill War Rooms, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, etc. are all within walking distance. We walked to almost everything we did and used our room as a hub. Shopping, drop off packages. Museums, stop by the lounge for a coffee and some cookies.…"
February 2018,Hotel 41,"Listed as a 5 star hotel and it is.  It would spoil the visit to say all they did for us.  This hotel is on the top floor of its sister (4 star) hotel.  There is a separate entrance and when you miss it you are meet with smiles to correct.  It is a hidden gem.  Lastly Buckingham palace is across the street, Victoria theater a block away where Hamilton is performing"
February 2018,If only real life could be like this...,"Third time lucky visiting the wonderful Hotel 41 and I can only really echo the same things that everyone else has said.   From the second you walk in the door, to the second you leave, you feel like you are part of an extended, well treated, pampered family.   Every single detail is thought of, from the moment you go to breakfast to the moment you go to bed.   I cannot recommend 41 enough to anyone.   My only problem is, it leaves you longing to go back!"
February 2018,Greatest surprise in Londkn,"First of all : this is a “ hotel boutique” Ok? Search for the concept  And one of the best I’ve ever being   Room : very beautiful decoration  Localisatin:5 minutões from Victoria metro station, some new and modern restaurants in the same street, and Buckingham palace  10” walk from Big Ben, westminster Abbey, and the Parlament   Staff : young crew, very helpful, kindly treatment, make every day a good day at the breakfast , at the special “ lounge”   “what make the city is the people , not the buildings “ 41 staff made that point !"
February 2018,Valentine Treat,"Having booked a surprise valentine trip for my wife, Hotel 41 made the experience all the more special. From the moment we walked into the foyer of the hotel, we were greeted by excellent and extremely helpful staff. Nothing was too much trouble throughout our stay and the romantic turndown service a lovely treat. We were recommended to this hotel by a friend, and we will certainly be recommending it.  Regards Hugh C"
February 2018,a very pleasant stay,"We stayed in the Hotel 41 from monday through thursday. It is a very comfortable place, where the staff tries to read your wishes from your eyes. We would always choose it again for a trip to London. The services include even the offer of complementary water when leaving the hotel for the day."
February 2018,Amazing Location and and even better Guest Services,"Absolutely impecable service, together with a great location. Prepare to be spoiled by wonderful staff that is ready to assist you in anything you might need. Naturally, this kind of service comes with proper pricing."
February 2018,41 London,Amazing hotel with the most amazing staff and service. Cozy rooms with lots of space. You feel special when you live there. It’s quiet but still there is a great vibe there. The lounge is absolutely perfect and cozy and the food is great- already looking forward to come back and say hello again to the wonderful staff that will take care of you 24/7. See you soon :)
February 2018,A Classic London atmosphere ,"This is not one of the typical hotel I would book for a London stay but booked it for some reasons as to closeness to station and so on. For being a five star hotel they do give you a full service from personnel to please, no complaints about this, but for us our idea of five star service is personel on alert but not on you all the time - but that’s us. Room was small but cozy. And needed one could go to the lounge to get soda or nibbling a or later on have a drink and cheese and others. Did have to call room service as the sheets were a bit stained and the warm water-bottle had broke in the bed. Hehe! Then in the service the forgot their phone ..  breakfast was really good and the offered gluten and lactose free alternatives. So been there and some that."
February 2018,Cozy and warm,I've stayed here twice and I loved it. The staff is super friendly and nice and made our stay perfect from the first minute until the last. I didn't complain about anything and that's very rare :-) the rooms are warm and cozy and I couldn't wait to fall into the bed at night. I would always come back!!! 
January 2018,Impressive not oppressive ,"Came for a weekend as a birthday treat, and was so impressed by the attention to detail at every level: the staff are incredibly helpful and welcoming, the rooms well decorated as per the whole hotel, the food delicious and some wonderful extra perks: free snacks, massive array for breakfast, personal touch down service (including little things like winding a USB lead up neatly, with a Velcro tie), plus offering a very tasteful and welcoming restaurant. This truly feels like an elegant town house vs. ‘Just another hotel’. It’s located right in the centre of London within a stones throw of main attractions, yet with the feeling you are cosily ensconced from the hectic frenzy of city life. Wow, we will be back!"
February 2018,London's No.1 Hotel for a reason!,"My wife and I have just returned from a short break at Hotel 41 and I can only describe this short break as amazing!!  From the minute we stepped into the entrance lobby we were treated like royalty!  The hotel is beautiful and very well maintained, our room was spotlessly clean and well serviced twice per day!  The staff could not do enough to make our visit extra special and the attention to detail was fabulous! The location could not be better and allowed us to walk most places we wanted to visit, however, coming back and sitting beside the cosy executive lounge fire on a cold February afternoon was fantastic! Well done to the team at Hotel 41, no question why it is London’s No.1 hotel!"
February 2018,Truly Fabulous,"Hotel 41 deserves the accolades it receives, everything about this beautiful boutique hotel is wonderful, from the welcome you get at the door, the drinks you're offered as you check in, the complimentary snacks, the ambience and the decor, the rooms and the en suites to the staff, all of whom are polite, helpful and clearly happy to go the extra mile, you are all credits to your organisation. The rose petals on the bed, the hot water bottles and the fireplaces in the rooms simply added to the feeling of luxury. We felt truly spoilt, thank you Hotel 41, we had the perfect night."
December 2017,Benchmark of class,"Our 4th visit to Hotel 41 in as many years and it absolutely isn’t an exaggeration to say that each visit has got better and better. Our last visit was to celebrate our 10th anniversary and the kindness and standard of customer service that we were shown made it something that will live long in our memories. Hotel 41 remains the benchmark against which we measure service at other hotels, which explains why we are currently planing our 5th visit."
January 2018,Private Club Feel in Heart of London ,"The customer service is outstanding! Everyone that works there is smiling and friendly & you feel like they truly want to help you with anything you need.  I won’t stay anywhere else in London ever again other than Hotel 41.  From the customer service, to the quality of the food, to the comfort of your room....all 5 stars!!!"
December 2017,"Great hotel, excellent service ","We stayed in Hotel 41 for a week from Boxing Day until the first of January. From the moment we arrived we were amazed by the excellent service. The moment you check in the staff know you by name, they remember about everything you tell. We went to a show and the day after one of the staff asked us about the show.  In the lounge there are always some snacks (completely) and you can order about any drink you can think of. I was getting a bit ill during my stay (I catched a cold) and one of the staff told me I should drink a Toddy. Didn’t know what that was but see got one from me and it did help. The next few days several members of the staff asked me how I was doing.   We’ve stayed in several 5 star hotels but you can’t compare hotel 41 with any of these. Hotel 41 is a 5 star…"
December 2017,The Perfect Hotel,We were going to London for our honeymoon and decided to stay at Hotel 41 after seeing its high rating and great reviews.  The hotel and staff surpassed our expectations. The staff surprised us with a congratulations cake in our room. The room was spacious and comfortable and we looked forward to the nightly turn down service (loved the hot water bottle). The lounge was a great place to relax after spending a day sightseeing. We enjoyed the food and goodies from the Pantry. The staff were exceptional; very friendly and helpful.  The location of the hotel could not be better. Lots of great restaurants nearby and it was easy to travel all over London. We would never be able to stay anywhere else if in London and we're already planning a trip back.
November 2017,Ultimate Service,"The hotel was warm and welcoming and was an ideal home base for our time in London.  The room was a bit smaller than we expected, but what the room lacked in size, the staff made up for with their impeccable service.  The staff was extremely attentive and was happy to help with any request.  In fact, they even followed up with a special request after we checked out!  The hotel is well located, within walking distance to the train/metro station and many of the top sites in London.  Each evening, after a long day of sightseeing, we looked forward to the varied and delicious Plunder the Pantry offerings in the cozy lounge."
December 2017,Industry Excellence!,"The staff is remarkable. The property is exquisite. The location is unbelievable. From a Christmas tree in our room, stocking on our door and present under the tree, they made my daughter’s Christmas in London unforgettable. Thank you 41 Hotel"
November 2017,What a treat,This hotel is located directly across the street from Buckingham Palace and close to the tube.  My husband and I stayed here for three nights and were blown away by the service/cleanliness and attention to detail from this hotel. You are greeted at the front door and escorted up to a wonderful lounge area where you are given a glass of bubbly (really good) and olives while you get relaxed and checked into your room.  The room we were in was wonderful clean and by English standards quite roomy.  To my surprise on the first evening there was a water bottle in my bead which was a nice added touch to our stay and upon arrival there after it heated my bed before I retired to it lol.  Morning breakfast was included and it was yummy - I am a coffee snob and there coffee was good!!!!  I…
December 2017,Still amazing,"Our second stay at 41 was every bit as magical as the first. Perhaps helped, just a little, by the surprise upgrade to the wonderful Conservatory Suite (what an amazing treat - thank you!). Plunder the pantry food was varied and delicious, as were the canapes which accompanied our cocktails.  It was great to see some familiar faces, and a few new members of the team, all delivering the trademark service for which 41 is renowned. So tough to drag ourselves away from the lounge and back to the real world, but we're already planning our next visit."
July 2017,Top Hotel,This hotel is top notch. From the time you check in to your departure the staff makes you feel like royalty. The hotel is also in a great location. As an added bonus the “snacks” that are put out towards evening out are unbelievable. One night after a long day we had wine and the snacks it was a perfect end to the day. Keep up the excellent job.
December 2017,Once in a lifetime,There are no words to describe the experience of staying here. 7 stars.  Tucked away above the Reubens hotel you would never know that this luxurious hotel is there. Extraordinarily attentive staff with fantastic attention to detail. Food was wonderful.
July 2017,incredible accomodation,"Luxury Hotel, incredible service, nice surrounding area and amazing staff. I am always happy to come here when I have to visit London, is such a great experience and it become better at any new stay. Ok it's expensive but it's really a great way to spend my money because everything it's excellent!!!!!!  I just love this place"
January 2018,New Year Celebration,Recently returned from seeing in the New Year at 41 Hotel and they certainly do it in a style that befits the hotel. It is difficult to beat a Glass of Champagne for toasting the New Year and a Piper to pipe in the New Year. It was our second visit and it certainly lives up to all the reviews. It is like coming back to your favourite place where they welcome you with open arms and a glass of champagne. The button - WhateverWhenever - on the telephone in your room is an indication of the level of service they pride themselves in. It is answered very quickly. Can’t wait for our next visit.  
September 2017,Cozy place,Small room but cozy. The hotel staff are some of the best I've experienced around the world. It is across from Buckingham Palace and if you're looking for a boutique 5 star experience I would recommend this hotel.
December 2017,"Quaint, Cozy, Excellent!","The service here is amazing, most attentive staff I have experienced in a hotel.  The vibe is like a private club.  When you access the property it is past a reception desk to an elevator.  When you get tot hotel, it occupies one floor.  In the center there is a lounge featuring drinks and food all day.  Fireplaces, cozy sofas and intimate tables.  If you want to people watch and mingle in a bigger hotel environment, you can go next door to the Rubens Hotel. Larger, more impersonal, however still lovely!  I had several drinks at the bar there and listened to live music. My room was well appointed, comfortable bed, deluxe sheets, top of the line toiletries, fantastic turn down service treats! Hot water bottle in bed every night was a great after a cold day in the city! I will…"
December 2017,Another fabulous stay,"We stayed here just after our wedding in 2015 and decided to return for our anniversary. Right from the moment I booked we were treated like celebrities.   The staff here know how to be present, without being in your face and the whole operation is incredibly slick. There are so many hotels I've been to which should take some advice from the Hotel 41.  The food choice from breakfast through to ""plunder the pantry"" is extremely generous and we didn't need to eat out as we were so full. The wine and cocktail list is equally good. We tried a bottle of Hannibal from their sister winery in South Africa and it was seriously good.  The Hotel and its staff stand out as there are an abundance of extra touches here. I don't want to spoil the surprise for you so I'll just list a few things…"
January 2018,Perfection,"This was my first time to visit this beautiful hotel and it deserves 6 stars for the perfect service warm and friendly too perfection. The reception and lobby are so beautiful you don't want to leave. It transports you to another place in time. The rooms are so pretty, with fire places and wonderful bedding.  The service is impeccable. Everyone you meet is charming and have a wealth of knowledge and they all want to be of service.  Ivo and Laura were so helpful to me as was Victoria the concierge, Aaron the doorman and Laura the GM and her staff...just lovely people who continue to earn important awards that they truly deserve."
December 2017,Christmas in London,"Six of us stayed at this lovely boutique hotel just a few blocks from Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station.  The property is very elegant but homey. You are made to feel as an honored guest in someone’s home.  Perfect for Christmas morning. The staff is friendly and attentive. The complimentary “Plunder The Pantry” service provides high quality snacks throughout the day, including a light evening buffet.  The Guest Services staff are excellent at making dinner, entertainment and tour arrangements. Individual kindnesses shown by staff members were also much appreciated.  I have never had a better hotel experience."
January 2018,Perfect as always,This was our 4th stay at Hotel 41 and it is always perfect. There is no other way to describe it. The staff are amazing and nothing is ever too much trouble. It is a peaceful and relaxing retreat in the centre of London. Can't wait to return for Christmas 2018. 
December 2017,As good or better than expected,Stayed here 12/26/17 - 12/31/17.  Could not have asked for better service and a better experience up and down their team.  Special shout out to Nicole who was just outstanding in her service but then again so was EVERYONE else only wish I jotted everyone's name down.   The location is awesome and easy to walk to all over London or a short walk to the Victoria Tube stop. I can't wait to return and would not think of staying anywhere else in London.  We had a large room particularly for a European city which was very comfortable. Thank you !
December 2017,Service beyond comparison...,"Although not returning to stay this time, I had been in touch to ask a favour for my Partners Christmas present.  Not something I was sure they could do, but I decided to ask anyway.  I initially contacted Malcolm, the General Manager, with my request.  He responded positively and gave me the relevant detail I needed to make my choices, which I did.  I arranged to pick up and reimburse them for my Partners Christmas present on Christmas Eve (which they had arranged), and was greeted by name, offered a hot chocolate drink on arrival (it was cold and windy outside) and asked to go to the reception desk upstairs.  Again, greeted by the team by name and the present was brought through.  I expected the present in a 41 bag or similar but was flabbergasted to find the present had been…"
June 2017,You won't be disappointed. Hotel 41 is simply AMAZING. Book. Now.,"Let's start with the service:  Hotel 41's customer service is unrivalled. This is the hotel other hotels should be looking at and learn from. Professional, committed and friendly staff that goes out of their way to help you. Oh you'll notice this as soon as you check in. And love it.   Hotel and rooms: Not the biggest hotel in London, but that doesn't mean the rooms are small. The room is spacious, well-designed and well equipped with pretty much everything that you could need for your stay.  Extrememly comfortable bed and stunning room will make you feel right at home.  Location: Hotel41 is located near Victoria station - one of the biggest hubs in London - which makes it easy for many to simply walk from the tube station to the hotel. If you're travelling from Gatwick you can…"
December 2017,A wonderful stay in London,"The entrance to Hotel 41 is right next to The Reubens and quite discrete but once in welcomed by a very friendly Lukas who had already been a star by email, receiving a parcel and helping me prepare a surprise for my wife.  We were taken upstairs and booked in while being given a complimentary glass of champagne which we finished off sitting comfortably infront of the fire.  We had arrived very early and left our bags while going for lunch and on our return they were all in the room. We had booked the conservatory suite which features a glass roof and large double jacuzzi bath room.  The romantic turndown was a perfect end to our day.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and all the staff were friendly and managed to remember who we were and what we had done in order to ask how it…"
November 2017,Simply the Best!,"I love this hotel! The customer service starts with the reservationist, Nikki! She made the booking process seamless and is an asset to the hotel! Andrew, who seems to do everything at the hotel made my stay brilliant with all of the little touches like my favorite cupcakes and football on the tv 😊 Upon leaving, i contacted Nikki about another stay and although 41 is fully booked, she still helped me find a great place at a partner hotel! If you want to be treated like royalty... 41 is your place to stay! ps- the shower in the split level suite is AMAZING! "
November 2017,November,"Hotel 41 was booked as a surprise night away  for our 40th Birthday, by our lovely friends. We were greeted with a glass of complementary champagne and the experience just got better as the day continued. The staff just couldn't do enough for us, and it made for such an enjoyable stay.  The room was spacious and well equipped with everything that you could need for your stay. Exceptional service and can't wait to return to the hotel"
August 2017,Excellent service in a quaint setting,My wife and took a quick trip to London in August.  The service and room at Hotel 41 was top notch.  Great location to see many of the London sites.  The staff was on top of everything. We have no complaints. 
November 2017,Superb service,The service and attention to detail was exceptional. Nothing was too much trouble. An intimate hotel which caters for  each individual. The executive lounge is a perfect size providing a comfortable environment to relax. Fantastic venue for a special event. Husband was receiving his MBE and the hotel made him feel special and remembered all the detail of the event. 
October 2017,Simply Awesome!,"Definitely the best service I’ve ever encountered! My room was nice, view was poor, but I probably had one of the cheaper rooms (booked through Expedia). The perks that came in the cost of the stay were great (water, snacks, etc.) Definitely recommend!"
November 2017,Hotel before my visit to Buckingham palace for investiture,I stayed at this hotel with my wife and sister as it was only 200 metres from Buckingham Place. This is exceptional when it comes to customer service. Everything was perfect from the front desk to the room and the amazing Executive Lounge.  I stay in hotels all round the world and this beats them all. Small and a real throwback to the days when people were there to delight and serve. Give yourself an exceptional experience here.
November 2017,Wow wow wow,"If you got a room here you will never forget it. A small hotel but one of the best. Rooms are perfect but the main thing is the staff and the service. It is royal. The staff is the most professional and committed I have ever seen, even in hotels that are the best of the best on London, and I've been around all of them. A special note of recommendation should be given to Victoria that goes out of her way to make your stay perfect but this is true to all the staff. Of you have had here more stars I would have given then in this review. "
November 2017,Wow ,"Wow what a hotel, everything about this place is superb. I've. Never stayed in a hotel as lush as this. Immaculate. It's the Madonna of all London hotels. If looking to impress take a loved one or your other half here"
February 2018,fabulous,"Excellent hotel,   its not for everyone, if you want a busy hotel with a buzzy bar this is not for you, however if you want luxury, superb service great location and wonderful staff then you will love it. we could not fault anything highly recommend."
October 2017,Birthday trip with my 10 yr old daughter,My fourth time visiting Hotel 41 and again an amazing experience. Thank you for making my daughters birthday celebration something extra. I really appreciate the lovely cake waiting for us when we arrived. And that nice information kit you assembled with more Harry Potter themed sites to visit after we got back from the studio tour was such a lovely gesture. I’m already looking fwd to my next stay with my husband in April. //Malin
January 2018,Fabulous! ,My stay at the hotel was just perfect! It totally exceeded my expectation. I stayed at the Monarch Suite with access to the executive lounge and I felt like a princess. The staff was very helpful and nice. The service is on the highest levels! I adored cosmetics (Penhaligons). It was my birthday and I received so many compliments from the hotel! One guy from the staff waited me at 1 am (this time they are closing normally) because he noticed that the day before I had come at this time for the glass of champagne. Isn’t it adorable?! At 41 Hotel you have all you need to relax and feel at the hotel like at home. It totally worth stating. I’m happy that I’ve chosen this hotel! It’s very hard now to stay at other hotels. I highly recommend it! 
January 2018,Boutique chic at its finest!,"Perfect stay to celebrate my 30th Birthday. Upon arrival, we were greeted at the front door with the option of having a cup of hot chocolate with a selection of sprinkles and added treats. We were then taken upstairs to the hotel sitting room /reception and were welcomed with a glass of our chosen champagne. Great start to a romantic weekend! We were then advised we had been upgraded to their conservatory suite which is a stunning 2 storey room, with electric horizontal blinds that open and close the blinds on the huge conservatory glass roof, above the amazingly comfortable (best ever) super king size bed. Never have we been as comfy as this before in any hotel. We were given loads of extra treats complimentary, such as canapés, and a birthday cake and sweet treats (Selection…"
January 2018,A gem of a hotel,"Mesmerising stay in hotel 41. Located right opposite the Royal Mews on Buckingham Palace Road and above the Reuben’s Hotel, this little gem of the hospitality industry is deservedly ranked Number One in the United Kingdom. From the concierge to the reception, from the restaurant team members to the Room Attendant, everyone exceeds expectations. In fact they all raised the bar to such level that it can’t be toppled in term of service.  There’s a lot of five stars hotels around but the one that makes the o difference is the people. Highly recommended."
December 2017,Amazing stay with some exceptional service!!! ,"We stayed for 1 night after staying at a 5 Star Mayfair hotel the night before! Well the difference was amazing. This boutique hotel is incredible with exceptional service from all the lovely and very professional members of staff. They offer personal service at another level. I have stayed in some lovely hotels around the world but this hotel takes service to an exceptional standard. The room was spotless with some lovely touches and plenty of room on two different levels. My wife and I really enjoyed the extra nibbles, Sweets, Ice cream and plundering the pantry! It is the little extras that differentiate this hotel from others.   Thanks to hotel 41 for allowing us to relax and enjoy a special weekend. "
January 2018,Unbelievable accommodation and Service,"We arrived at Hotel 41 to be greeted by friendly helpful staff, As soon as we entered the hotel we were offered hot chocolate, which was great considering it was cold outside. As we checked in our bags were taken to our room. While checking in we were given champagne and then a tour of the hotel and information about our room. Our room was a split level with lounge/fire place downstairs and bathroom, bed upstairs.  The first night we had a glass of wine and were treated to free canapes and the staff there were exceptional. They were friendly, helpful and entertaining.  We had dinner booked at the adjoining hotel, The Rubens at the Palace, which is the sister of Hotel 41. We were escorted through an internal door to the restaurant and introduced the the other staff. It was great…"
January 2018,"Back to 41, back to heaven...","Yet another accolade - this one from Trip Advisor  556240108  As very regular long-term guests, we love returning to 41.  Unusually, we have been twice in the past fortnight.  First was to stay for a family birthday dinner in Mayfair, and for the pre-dinner drinks we all met at 41.  The champagne was presented with canapes and a beautiful complimentary cake (which we arranged to be kept in the fridge for the next day to share out and take home).  Second, three days later we had a business meeting prior to a city break in Florence.  We enjoyed our complimentary welcome glass of Veuve Cliquot in the Exec Lounge and ordered a fish and chip lunch - always a good combination.  After our meeting, we sank gratefully into the sofa by the fire for evening drinks and canapes before…"
January 2018,They go the extra mile,"Hotel 41 lives up to its reputation. You feel special stepping into Hotel 41, from the exclusive entrance, to the personal escort up to the hotel itself and the champagne upon arrival. Staff are very attentive, but no overly so. We were treated to a upgrade, to a quirky suite that had a sitting area leading to the bedroom up a flight of stairs. Hotel 41 don't scrimp on details, providing complimentary treats like chocolates, his and her toiletries and even a heat pack warming up the bed! We went out for dinner and came back to candles and rose petals! More hotels should put in the effort that Hotel 41 does! I would definitely recommend!!"
October 2017,Going Home Again,"Although we live in Washington, DC, every time we visit Hotel 41, it feels like we are going home again.  From the personal welcome at the street level reception desk to our early morning check-in in the Executive Lounge, everyone greeted us by name and seem to remember us (we only visit once a year).  Here is an example of the level of service to expect.  My wife prefers foam pillows, while I'm OK with feather.  The hotel remembered that my wife sleeps on the left side of the bed and arranged the pillows correctly.  Hotel 41 must have an excellent customer database to record this level of information.    Also, any hotel that has a button on phone that reads ""Whatever, Whenever"" is a place you should consider staying.   After watching the construction of the new building complex…"
January 2018,Amazing hotel in london," Sthe staff was really amazingly friendly and helps with all issues. The breakfast was suppeb and vrey tasty .The Rooms are clean, the led tv works perfectly and the shower is an amazingly waterfall.highly recommend this hotel ..."
January 2018,Attention to the details ,"Superb service and a beautiful setting! Staff are quick to engage you in conversation, make suggestions and provide helpful tips, and make you feel welcome. I was always greeted by name and the staff took the time to learn more about my interests and my plans. I enjoyed the many personal touches...for example, after seeing a musical that I had mentioned in conversation earlier, I returned to my room that evening to find some small treats in connection to that same musical. The setting is lovely, presenting a cozy, yet classic feel. I stayed in an Executive Suite, which did not disappoint. Classic black and white styling with personal touches. Excellent location...within walking distance of many museums, theatres, restaurants, and Buckingham Palace. Also easy to access many…"
January 2018,Best of London,"My husband and I met our adult daughter in London for a few days of sight-seeing and to enjoy the city. Hotel 41 was our favorite part of the trip! We felt like we were the only ones staying there (even though we weren’t), the staff was so attentive, welcoming, and thoughtful. The breakfast in the lounge was delicious and fresh. A true taste of Britain with an exquisitely set table near the cozy fireplace.  They welcomed us at every turn, offering to help us with directions, recommendations, and even welcomed us with champagne!  We were here for our 30th wedding anniversary, and we are already looking forward to returning. This is the place we want to stay every time we visit London. Thank you to all who made us feel so welcomed! Our daughter had to leave for her flight at 3am,…"
January 2018,Wonderful experience,This Hotel is unbelievable. The Staff are exceptional and the facilities are second to none. We booked for my Wife's birthday and when we arrived in the room we had a selection of treats and a birthday cake. The executive lounge is a real winner but the staff really make the difference. This will now be our home from home when we visit London.
April 2017,Simply Wonderful,It has been a while since I have stayed at the Hotel 41 but it was a great experience.  The service and facilities are first class in all respects.  It was a great place for a business meeting.  The service provided to my invited meeting guest was perfect. 
January 2018,"Lovely service, we will be back","We had a very short stay here and it was as we expected from the other reviews. Staff very attentive and nothing too much trouble.  Despite the central location once you are upstairs and inside it is very quiet and we heard nothing in our room.   Lots of nice little touches abound like the complementary snacks, ice-cream and cheese in the evening. Turn down service folded our clothes and event tidied up charging cables. Breakfast was top notch.  We'll be back!"
January 2018,Birthday Weekend in London,Stayed in this fantastic hotel for my wife's birthday and had a the most memorable weekend.  I really believe that the key to 'Hotel 41's' success is that they manage to make you feel special from the moment you check in and are offered a glass of champagne till the moment you sadly have to leave.  We loved 'plunder the pantry' in the evening which I think is pretty unique all the way through to one of the best breakfasts we have ever had in the morning.  The service we received was exceptional with all staff being so friendly and personable and a huge thank you to the management team at Hotel 41 for the complimentary bottle of champagne left in our room which we enjoyed in front of the fire.
January 2018,I keep coming back!,"Never a disappointment, hotel 41 is the epitome of comfort, class and a top quality hotel with a lovely friendly atmosphere from the second you arrive with a glass of champers on check in and helpful, genuinely friendly staff and comfort at every turn. There’s the fabulous b bar cafe on one side of the hotel, with the best salt beef sandwich you’ll ever taste- and on the other, the wonderful Ruebens at the palace (sister hotel) with the new ‘curry room’ which serves the best currys along with superb cocktails, live music and wonderful service are the norm. You don’t need to travel very far to have a superb time and, like me, you’ll keep coming back again and again 😊"
February 2017,"The most wonderful hidden gem, we are so glad to have found it and can't wait to return","The most wonderful hotel, a real hidden gem. My husband and I both agree 41 is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in in the world, and we have visited quite a few! From point of booking and arrival at the hotel, right through to departure we felt like the most important people in the world. The service at 41 is impeccable, as is the decor throughout, not to mention the stunning array of food in the 'pantry'. We were served complimentary hot cheese and ham sandwiches (over a glass of wine and a game or two of chess on the balcony!!) before we went to see our show, as we ran out of time to go somewhere for dinner, and this was a really lovely gesture by the hotel. After seeing a show in town we returned to the hotel and we able to 'plunder the pantry' which was simply put,…"
November 2017,So different....,This might be the best hotel that I have ever stayed in.Not only were the staff spot on but the vibe was like no other hotel I have been too. Upon coming to the reception area the service was like no other I have had
November 2017,Small and Perfect!,"Great little London hotel! Staff was very helpful with our various needs (from arriving early to transportation) and we really enjoyed our stay. This hotel excels at all the little unexpected things, like leaving a hot water bottle in your bed at turndown, along with other treats like pillow spray or lip balm. The location is perfection, right across from Buckingham Palace and close to the Victoria tube and train station, so you can get to everywhere you need. The snack pantry was one of my favorite parts (all hotels should do this) and it was nice being able to grab a quick snack whenever you wanted! Rooms and bathrooms were well-appointed and quite spacious as well. I'd definitely return!"
December 2017,Incredible place like no other.,We stayed here for a night on the 19th December as it was our anniversary.  I had high expectations and they were completed exceeded. All staff without exception were friendly and welcoming. We were given an upgrade and we were blown away with the penthouse suite. The food was amazing and there was lots of it. The complimentary champagne on arrival was lovely. Afternoon tea and breakfast were superb. Thanks for a memorable trip. We will definitely return. 
December 2017,A Royal Honeymoon ,When you get married in Disney World  where do you go on your honeymoon? How about across the road from The queen of England?  Hotel 41 is the most luxurious experience from champagne welcomes to dvds & popcorn delivered to your room to high tea fit for royalty.  Even when you come back to your suite after a long day shopping at harrods what better way to do it than with rose petals covering ur room and a cosy hot water bottle in your turn down queen sized bed?  My husband and I fell madly in love with this hotel & we cannot wait for our next visit already!  Love the Robbs 
November 2017,The Best Hotel ,"Hotel 41 is the best hotel I have stayed at.  The personal service that the staff at Hotel 41 provided during our stay was excellent. They would greet us at the door, and in the lounge by our names. They would provide recommendations on places to see, restaurants to eat at, etc.  The rooms were spotless and evening turn down service always provided a treat, hot water bottles in the bed and a lip balm or another small surprise. "
December 2017,Maybe perfection,"Must be great when even your morning toast is shaped like a bunny!  Make a list of all the things you want in a five (maybe six) star hotel within 200 yards of Her Majesty’s backyard.   Now imagine a service level that matches this dream hotel.  Now, make a reservation at “41”!  You won’t regret it.  Enough said?  "
December 2017,"Second visit, amazing hotel","Our trip in early December was our second visit back to Hotel 41.  Great location-next to Buckingham Palace and Victoria Tube stop / National Rail.  Excellent staff - helped with musical tickets (at the last minute), dinner reservations and local recommendations at markets.  Logistics are great - fast, free Wifi (I was able to run my VPN without any issue), everything worked.  The details are not missed - turn down services are amazing, hotel water bottle in the bed and nightly sweet treats.  The Executive Lounge is great - perfect snacks, Raid the Pantry, drinks, fireplace, mingle with other guests if you want or don't.  We haven't been to every hotel in London but this is our favorite."
April 2017,Pure luxury with view of the stars.,"Stayed here for the third time and always is perfect. Love the posh and exclusiveness of the hotel. More like a secret hideaway. Our suite had a glass ceiling and we could watch the sky at night. Food delicious, staff very professional. Nice touches, like sweets, cakes and fruit it the room. All just perfect."
December 2017,Deserving of 6 stars!,"Deservedly Number 1 in London on TripAdvisor! My partner and I have just stayed for 1 night only but will definitely return. A wonderfully intimate and luxurious hotel where absolutely nothing is too much trouble, our room was beautiful, heavenly bed and brilliant shower and bathroom, the executive lounge with complimentary champagne on arrival and all day snacks and treats a real delight. We returned from dinner out to find our bed turned down, bedside candles lit and lights dimmed and a hot water bottle placed in my partners side of the bed...fantastic!  The full English breakfast was one of the best I have ever enjoyed, the home made hashbrowns superb! Thank you so much to all the staff, exemplary service and hospitality all round, we hope to return soon!  "
November 2017,Fantastic hotel with wonderful staff 10/10,"Customer service = top notch. Steve in the executive lounge was particularly helpful and friendly, giving us a great insight into the local area and made us all laugh. The rooms are exceptionally well decorated and cater to one's every whim; the room was equipped with hot water bottles and laptop cushions at our request, along with the elegant Penthaligon's toiletries. View of the golden carriage in the Royal Mews from our executive suite. Thoroughly recommend if in search of some high-end luxury."
December 2017,Another visit 3 years later......................,Short and to the point. Second visit and still the best in London.  Nothing too much trouble and no wonder its full most of the time. Tried to get in for later in the week and fully booked. Book in advance and enjoy how a 5 star hotel should be run.
October 2017,Always a Warm Welcome!!,My husband & I have stayed at Hotel 41 for many years & its our Constant into London because we are welcomed as friends. If you want to feel The exclusive & Fancy a touch of the Best...Book in & see for yourself!:-) Enjoy!!
November 2017,Amazing service and great location!,"This was our first time to London and we weren't sure where to go or stay but trusted that this hotel got such great reviews on TripAdvisor. Let me just say we weren't disappointed. The hotel is in a fabulous location, close to Buckingham Palace, Victoria Station, and tons of other easy to walk to landmarks. I have to say, our expectations were exceeded by our stay. The staff was so friendly and welcoming, and eager to make our experience incredible. Nicole provided us with great recommendations for dinner and entertainment and we enjoyed everything she suggested. The rest of the staff knew our names and made us feel right at home. The housekeeping was amazing! There were so many little touches like cord keepers, and sheet warmers, and everyday they made sure our room was…"
November 2017,Luxury in a personal way,"A 3-night stay that was perfect. The service is excellent still on a very personal way. You really feel welcome and welcomed in this hotel. I have been in London several times, but this was without question the best hotelstay I have had in this city."
April 2017,Luxurious and Welcoming,Hotel 41 is beautiful and they have thought of everything you might need.  The beds are extremely comfortable.  The rooms are stunning.  The food is delicious.  The service is impeccable yet friendly.  We stayed for five nights and every time we came back to the hotel we were welcomed by name and asked about our day and it felt like we were home.  Location is also great (just down the road from her maj).
November 2017,Fantastic service and building ,"Stayed here for 2 nights and the staff were amazingly accommodating- nothing too much trouble. They booked my friend and I into a hair salon last minute, recommended restaurants and were truly fantastic. The best location to tourist attractions and the most comfy bed. "
November 2017,A little hidden gem in London.....,"I booked Hotel 41 as a surprise weekend away to treat my Wife for her 40th Birthday. We were greeted with a glass of complementary champagne and the experience just got better as the weekend continued. The staff just couldn't do enough for us, and it made for such an enjoyable stay.  The room was spacious and well equipped with everything that you could need for your stay. In the evening, we were up against the clock in getting ready to go for dinner at the Roux at the Landau and the room was left in a bit of a mess when we left. However when we returned, the fire was on, candles lit with rose petals around the bed, background music playing and the everything in the room has been tidied (clothes folded and hung up, toiletries arranged neatly in the bathroom) and there was even a…"
August 2017,Fantastic Hotel!,"Stayed here for our 2 year Anniversary back in August and had a fantastic stay. From the minute you walk in you are treated like royalty. Staff are very polite and well trained. We really enjoyed the welcome champagne from the trolley, very nice touch! The room was beautifully decorated with extremely comfortable beds. Had a few Brandies in the bar when we got back from the show and was again, very well looked after. I have stayed in several of the top Hotels in London (The Dorchester, Savoy, Shangri La, Mandarin Oriental etc) and I can honestly say, Hotel 41 is one of the best and has a lovely personal touch, which can get lost at other larger Hotels. I'd recommend it without hesitation."
October 2017,Great Hotel,"41 is most definitely the best hotel in the city! Everything is 5 star - location, accommodation, attitude. But what really makes this hotel superb is the Staff. All the crew members are real hospitality stars - attentive to every detail, responsive, cordial, helpful. Thanks a lot, people of Hotel 41!"
October 2017,Executive suite and lux from start to end,"The service is without peer. The fireplace in the executive lounge warmed me as I drank champagne and nibbled delicious canapés. Our tastefully decorated bedroom had either a 16 or 18 foot ceiling and the lighting was easily adjustable to provide anywhere from single reading to brilliant room light.  A pillow spray, complimentary bedroom slippers (new), and the offer of a complimentary shoe shine all enhanced the experience and in-room spa options are available.  It is across the street from Buckingham Palace and gift shop.  We opted to dine at the pub at the corner, the Bag of Nails, and then enjoyed a restful good night sleep before returning to the USA."
October 2017,Excellent hotel that will spoil you for anywhere else,"We stared here for 4 nights in October.  I can't rave about this hotel enough, it was everything I expected and more - and I tend to expect quite a bit.  Room had those extra special touches - welcome note and chocolates, towel warmer in bathroom, robe and slippers, hot water bottle in bed each night, turn-down service with different surprises.  The staff were truly exceptional - quickly learned our names and preferences.  This hotel pampers you beyond belief without giving off a feeling of pretentiousness - we cannot imagine staying anywhere else in London.  Thanks to everyone who helped to make our stay special."
October 2017,The Best Hotel in the World,"There is only one problem with this hotel: I will never be satisfied at another hotel after staying at Hotel 41.  It is a small hotel -- 22 rooms I believe -- and is more of a private club.  The hotel centers around the Executive Lounge, a dark wood paneled room with fireplace, tables, chairs, and a large, knowledgeable, and very amiable staff who work to assist the guests constantly.  Perhaps the only thing more abundant than the staff is the food that it out in the Lounge at all hours.  There was no request that the staff did not attempt to meet.  Our room contained a fireplace that was lit every evening when we returned.  I have never stayed at another hotel that approaches the beauty, grace, and sustenance of Hotel 41."
October 2017,Exceptional experience,"My husband and I stayed here in early October and our experience at Hotel 41 was ideal in every way from the moment we arrived, to our suite (upgraded for free--thank you Hotel 41!), an exceptional dinner in The English Grill with a complimentary scotch tasting, as well as surprise champagne and strawberries when we returned to our room after dinner. Our suite was unbelievable--two levels, fireplace, and a retracting ceiling so we could enjoy the stars at night. I've never seen anything like it. The location was ideal, in the heart of the city right by Buckingham Palace, and yet the hotel felt completely quiet and private. Employees Nicole, Patrycja and Andrew worked hard to make us feel like royalty. We loved our stay and wish we could have stayed longer!"
October 2017,Wow- secret treasure in London.,"The attention to detail at this hotel is unparalleled. The staff is impeccably perceptive- they anticipate your needs before you even know you have them! If you ask for a wake up call, they ask if what type Of coffee they can send with the call. If you walk through the door with luggage, they not only take your luggage, they personally walk you into the conservatory lounge and pour you a glass of champagne while they check you in. Sometimes they surprise you and upgrade you to one of their 6 exclusive suites- and give you turndown service with candles and rose petals. We feel like we stepped into an alternate reality- truly pampered and valued. We travel frequently and seek out lovely places to stay. We have never had an experience like this before! If you get a chance to stay…"
September 2017,A great place,The space that I stayed with my husband was definitely one of the best. The room had a particular scent to give of its welcomness. We stayed there for 2 days and we just wanted to stay but we had to get going to our next country.
April 2017,The best little hotel in London!,"This place is truly a gem. My sister and I stayed here for three nights--the staff greeted us by name on arrival, we had a beautiful upgraded room and there were ALWAYS really really good snacks!! The staff was friendly and helpful and all of them had a great sense of humor. Stay here!!"
September 2017,Completely Spoiled for Any Other Hotel Experience!,"My husband and I spent 4 nights with his 93 year old mother at Hotel 41.  I chose this hotel for its reputation for outstanding concierge service and the Executive Lounge experience.  The hotel and staff exceeded our expectations.  The rooms are beautiful, clean and offer every amenity.  The lounge is a special treat, offering delicious food at all times of the day. But most importantly, the staff is perfection!  Every request is met with a cheerful professionalism and genuine kindness.  We are completely spoiled for any other hotel experience in London or elsewhere, and we are well traveled in the U.S. and abroad."
October 2017,Outstanding in every way- A hidden gem!,"We recently stayed at Hotel 41 for a couple of nights for my 40th Birthday. This was a family visit with our two children, aged 9 and 5. The hotel is truly beautiful, both the building itself and the decor which is incredibly stylish and has real personality, no bland beige interiors here! Instead you can expect luxe black and white carpets, real orchids, classic dark wood and touches of gilt. Nothing is too much trouble for the wonderful staff here.  Check-in takes place in the lovely lounge where you are welcomed with a complimentary glass of a fantastic choice of champagnes. The lounge is also where meals are served and this delightful setting complete with real fire makes you feel very relaxed and 'at home' Our suite was wonderful, the rooms was beautifully decorated and…"
September 2017,Best staying,"Best place to staying here, good for honeymoon or family, food was so good and testy, best recomendation, clean and staff  so friendly to talking. We will come and stay again for nex time. When stay here also so easy go out anywhere. Good and must be come again. "
August 2017,surprise upgrade,"We visit London every few years and always stay at the Rubens at the Palace Hotel.  We found it on line over ten years ago and told our travel agent about it.  The Rubens is a great hotel and part of Red Carnation Hotels (more on them later).  When we arrived at the hotel this past August, we were greeted at the door as usual and escorted to the front desk. We were informed that our room was upgraded to the hotel next door; the 41!!   I just finished reading the August copy of Travel Leisure and remembered the 41 was rated #1 in London ahead of The Goring.  Needless to say, my wife and I were excited.  We were escorted to the elevator up to the top floor of the hotel and into the magnificent lounge (think a private club atmosphere).  We were given the Balmoral Suite which was…"
September 2017,Above the Rest!,"We had the absolute pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in mid-September for 5 days. There is a reason this hotel is number 1, and it comes down to service.  The words, ""no or we can't"" do not exist in the staff's vocabulary. Hence, the ""whatever, whenever"" button on your hotel room's telephone.  We have been fortunate enough to stay in very nice hotels all over the world, but we can honestly say, the service at Hotel 41 exceeded all of them.  We are not going to single out one person on the staff because everyone was truly exceptional.  The hotel is very much like a secluded club, an oasis if you will, in a bustling big city. It was a pleasure coming back to Hotel 41 after a long day of taking in the sites of London. The atmosphere of the lobby was very tranquil. The candles, music…"
September 2017,OUTSTANDING,"By far the most outstanding, professional, accommodating, informed and courteous staff.  Have been to some of the finest Hotels here and abroad. It does not have the glitz of a Ritz, what it does have is an intimate, classy and peaceful setting.  You do feel like it is a home away from home.  There is delicious food all day in the Executive Lounge.  The room has quality toiletries as well as toothbrushes, shaving kit, sewing kit, iron and board etc.  Each day 2 bottles of water and a sweet treat.  The location is away from the craziness around Trafalgar and Piccadilly, yet very convenient.  2 minute walk to Victoria Station. Thank you to all the staff at Hotel 41 for providing a wonderful first time London experience."
August 2017,Stunning hotel & staff,"What a lovely treat in London - Hotel 41 - from the welcome at the door, drinks upon check in, attention to detail by the staff, beautifully appointed rooms, to the delicous ""help yourself"" food available at the bar, and scrumptious breakfast in the relaxed informal lounge. Outstanding all round - thanks Hotel 41!"
September 2017,Shaun and Kelly,"The most impressive accommodation of our three country visit. Every detail of our stay was well attended. The service was impeccable and tailored perfectly. The room was beautiful, and the location of the property was perfect. Being in the business of delivering an exceptional customer experience, I learned a few things on how to understand the importance of exceeding expectations. We were truly spoiled at Hotel 41, and felt very welcomed.   Thank you to the entire team at Hotel 41! "
September 2017,There is a reason why this Hotel is Number 1 on Trip Advisor!,"For location, service and just great attention to detail this hotel cannot be beaten. A big thanks to Malcolm and his team for making our stay here again so enjoyable.  If you are visiting London this hotel is opposite Buckingham Palace with Victoria station just 2 minutes walk away.  The staff are so helpfull, the rooms beautiful and the standards of cleanliness and quality of the bed linen are just awesome.  My advice is ""book it"" :)"
September 2017,Whatever! Whenever!,"There is a phone button marked ""Whatever! Whenever!"" in the room: this best describes the experience we had. Top-notch service, excellent breakfast and the fantastic ""Conservartory Suite"" made this a high-class stay in London. All is very british, especially the Afternoon Tea (really, try it!). Fine room perfumes, king size bed, 24h service and a fantastic view through the glass roof. One of the best five hotels we have been so far!"
September 2017,It's a Dogs Life,"If your looking for some last minute luxury with your dog Theodore can highly recommend 41, and we loved it too, we normally stay at the sister hotel in Kensington which is fabulous also, but we think we may have been swayed over to 41. It's definitely a home from home experience with only 28 rooms, lovely homely lounge with food on tap all day, we really enjoyed our evening in with yummy salad jars, shepherds pie, cheese ice cream and a really great bottle of wine, all the staff are just perfect a special giggle on arrival I chose a glass of pink champagne and Theo opted for the Bottom Sniffer beer rather than the Pawsecco. The room was beautifully clean, exceptionally well equipped and presented."
September 2017,Book this right now!!,"For our anniversary my husband surprised me with a trip to London. Although he booked the trip I booked the hotels so I finished the internet looking for the best hotels in London. We stayed at another 5 star hotel for the first few nights in soho and after a side trip came back to London to the 41. Although our first hotel was a true 5 star and quite immaculate, the 41 was in a league of its own!   The service is what makes the hotel out of this world! When tired and starving I went to the hotel staff to see if someone could help me find a sushi place for dinner (it was already 8pm- during London fashion week) I had no less than 3 people calling around and booking us at several different restaurants so we could pick where we wanted to go! They got us into Nobu and we were off…"
September 2017,The best hotel,"The best hotel I have stayed on. Very clean and service is superior. The staff help you with anything you ask for and you can always go to the lounge and find something nice to eat. It's not just a hotel, it's an great experience. Whould highly recommend this hotel. "
September 2017,Fantastic weekend,"Me and my collegues (6 persons) had an amazing stay in this hotel from friday - sunday. The atmosphere is really friendly and nice, the people that work there are extremely serviceminded and I could not ask for any better treatment. The ""whatever whenever"" button on the phone says it all. :)  The bed was really good to sleep in, the best I have ever had. Even better than the one I have at home. :) And the drink and food was also a really nice experience. Thank you Hotel 41 for the best hotel-experience of my life. "
September 2017,Unbelievable comfort service location!!,"Loved 41!!! Happened upon it- we didn't know it was trip advisor #1. Everyone was very real and helpful- food great. Location perfect. The extras were extremely notable- sheets, bath products. I won't go anywhere else in London! "
September 2017,Beautiful and Unique Small Hotel,"We absolutely loved Hotel 41 and would stay there again if we ever are lucky enough to go back to London!  Every staff member is so personable, and they go above and beyond to take exceptional care of you!  We stayed in an executive King room and it was just lovely!  The decor throughout the hotel was gorgeous. We loved being able to go through a door on the hotel side and access The Reuben Hotel next door for dining options and a bar.  We paid for a full breakfast every morning and the food was delicious!  One of the staff members heard we were going on a diet when we returned to the states, and when we got back to our room one day during our stay, there were candies, cookies, and sweets on the table with a little note saying that they hope we could enjoy these before our…"
October 2017,Everything you could want and more,"My wife and I visited London for our 12th anniversary last week.  We decided to stay at Hotel 41 based on the reviews and boutique appeal.  Needless to say, we couldn't be more happy with our choice.  The location is outstanding as are the accommodations.  However, the thing that truly sets them apart is the service.  The staff is incredibly friendly & helpful.  They did everything possible to ensure our stay was top notch.  Everyone of them knew who we were and provided guidance to ensure a great trip to London.  I really can't say enough.  I travel all over the world and Hotel 41 was one of my favorite places.  I highly recommend it and we will be back."
October 2017,Escape ,"This was our second visit to the 41 and once again we could not fault this hotel the staff are all fantastic, patryicia who served our breakfast the first 3 mornings is a lovely young lady, as were all the other members of the team, Lovely having a chat again with Steve who is just wonderful, we were upgraded to a junior suite which was fabulous all the little touches they do in your room are great, hot water bottle in the bed was a nice touch, you can have fresh milk with your tea which is lovely, chocolates when you arrive in your room, plunder the pantry is divine a must try for all visitors, ice cream is gorgeous. the only downside was we had to leave can’t wait for our next visit. "
October 2017,4 and counting.....,"This is our 4th time staying at Hotel 41 and as with the previous 3 stays, it couldn't have been any better.  The service continues to shine like no other.  The staff is eager to please, always, and everyone goes that extra step to make sure you feel like you're at home.  It's pure perfection in every way possible.  This will certainly not be our last time at Hotel 41 and I would recommend it to all.  A special thanks to the entire staff."
October 2017,Pure perfection,"My husband and I have just returned from a 2 night stay at Hotel 41. The trip advisor reviews say it all, this hotel is pure perfection, from the greeting at the entrance to the farewell when we left. Nothing too much trouble any problems dealt with immediately and fantastically. Beautiful rooms and fantastic food and drinks. All the staff here are amazing and special thanks to Dean for making us feel so at home. we truly cannot wait to return. Thank you so much Hotel 41."
October 2017,Smitten with Hotel 41,"We recently spent a week at Hotel 41 in a Junior Suite.  The hotel was able to arrange a private transfer from the airport directly to the hotel for us (BIG PLUS...considering we were exhausted and didn't want to have to think about anything after flying overnight).  Check-in was seamless (thanks for the champagne!).  Our room was well appointed with a very comfortable bed and chocolates at the ready.  We were on a trip celebrating my birthday, so there was also a birthday cake in the room upon arrival with a bottle of champagne.  These little details do not go unnoticed-we were so appreciative. We loved relaxing in the lounge, whether for high tea (you have to try it!) or a couple of cocktails-it was such a nice environment.  The whole team went out of their way to make sure…"
October 2017,Executive Club,"Hotel 41 was a wonderful surprise. We stayed for 3 nights and fell in love with the hotel. The rooms are beautiful, the staff is friendly, and awesome. Having access to the Executive Club was a wonderful treat for breakfast, cocktails, and even dinner. Really love the hotel...a hidden gem."
September 2017,London Luxuory ,"Above!This property was first class upon getting out of the taxi. The service was unbelieveable and they knew our names, what we liked, and took excellent care of us. The lounge area is beautiful, the rooms were lovely and the amenities were top notch. Would recommend this hotel to anyone.."
September 2017,Oh how we miss the Hotel 41!,"We returned recently from our fifth stay at the Hotel 41. Obviously we love it!  We loved the location before but it is fantastic now with the newly opened shops and restaurants that had been under construction during our past visits. The new Cardinal Place entrance to Victoria Station is very handy.   We cannot say enough wonderful things about the Hotel 41. As noted, excellent location near Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station. Beautiful building with an English country club feel. The Executive Lounge with the all-day snack options was a delight to return to for a break during busy days of sightseeing and for an evening snack/meal.   What sets the Hotel 41 a notch above is the staff. Every single person at the Hotel 41 works hard to make sure guests enjoy their stay. We've…"
October 2017,It just gets better and better,"This must be the best hotel in the world, bar none. Our second visit here and if it were possible, it was even better second time round.  The staff welcomed us back like returning relatives and they instinctively knew and remembered all the the things we liked, from the important (I don't drink alcohol) to the insignificant. However, that is the point, nothing is insignificant to these people. There is a warmth and humility that is genuine and tangible in everything that they do.   I want this review to be about the people and not necessarily the food, room, drink or service. In many ways that is a given with a 5* hotel. What makes Hotel41 so very different, unique and special is that they care about me (and my wife) for who we are. We are not rich, nor famous. In fact this…"
August 2017,Mini break ,"Hotel 41 is an amazing place - champagne on arrival, nibbles all through the day & fantastic service from all the staff. Best hotel in London in our opinion. We were treated to a romantic turn down on the first night - rose petals & dimmed lighting !  "
August 2017,Best staff on the planet!,"How many hotels can you say honestly get to know you personally.  This hotel has simply the best service bar none.  The staff looks to take care of absolutely anything you need at anytime of day, without making you feel uncomfortable or stuffy in any way.  Perfect staff for a perfect hotel!  Love staying here every time we travel to London."
July 2017,Gf and I loved it!,"Second time coming to London and absolutely loved this hotel.Very romantic and loved taking pictures of my girl in the hotel. Its also a good place to get transportation around if you did not rent a car. Loved exploring. Great service, thank you for everything guys!"
May 2017,Excellent..... as usual!,"Have stayed at Hotel 41 on numerous occasions. Always very good with polite and attentive staff.   When you check in you are served with a complimentary glass of Champagne which is a very nice touch.  The rooms are clean, tidy and decorated to a high standard.   The breakfast menu is extensive and extremely tasty.  Love the hotel and will go back again."
July 2017,Back again ,What can i say about this hotel every time I come to London I have to stay in this hotel it's very clean and the service is the best I strongly recommend this hotel to everyone thanks for everything guys 
July 2017,New Favorite Hotel - EVER!,"We were upgraded to this hotel from the Rubens at the Palace and simply LOVED every minute.  We stayed for 3 nights, but would have been happy with more!  Perfect location directly across from Buckingham Palace.  This was a retirement gift for my husband and everything was perfect - no complaints only compliments!  The staff (to include Florent, Stefan, Victoria, Mitchell, Paula and all others) made this a truly memorable stay.  Incredibly attentive and courteous to every guest and every request.  I am a travel agent and will be sending my clients here!"
September 2016,I love everything about this hotel,"I have been meaning to write this review since January 2016. The date drop down doesn't allow me to go that far back so Ive put Sept 2016 as thats as far back as I can go. My husband and I have been here twice now and there is nowhere else we'd rather stay when in London.  The staff are just wonderful, so polite and attentive without being overly so. The rooms are luxurious and spacious and both times we have been they have upgraded us for no extra charge. The second time we visited (January 2016) my husband had planned a surprise trip to New York. I was under the impression we were having a two night stay at Hotel 41 but he had arranged for just the one night but had been in contact with the hotel to make sure the kept up pretences that we were actually there for two nights.…"
July 2017,#1 for a reason,"The hotel is amazing and goes above and beyond any request you can imagine. It's beautiful, in a great location, and the staff sincerely wants to make your stay amazing. We stayed for 1 night for my birthday, and it was the most luxurious hotel I've ever stayed in. Be prepared for being treated like a celebrity."
July 2017,Hotel 41 Extraordinary,"When we read that Hotel 41 was voted the best hotel in London, it filled us with a mix of excitement and a bit of dread that it could not match the hype. Well, it does and goes beyond. From the choice of 4 champagnes when we arrived to the the solicitous attention to our needs and requests, Hotel 41 is unmatched. The staff is especially attentive and they seemed to genuinely care about us and our experiences. The ""plunder the pantry"" is truly a wonderful way to end a day sightseeing in London. I have already recommended the Hotel 41 to a few of my colleagues and friends."
July 2017,Two visits a week apart,"My husband, son and I had two fabulous experiences this month at Hotel 41.  We stayed three nights before heading to other destinations and then returned for another three nights before flying home.  The staff went way above and beyond any hotel we have ever stayed.  Our room (both times) was a 2-level suite which was perfect for our small family. The sofa-bed on the first level accommodated our son while we enjoyed a king-size bed on the second level.   We really enjoyed the lounge and the hotel location!  We highly recommend Hotel 41!"
May 2017,Top Notch,"After a long and exciting trip through mainland Europe, we were tired and wanted to spend a few days in London.  We needed some major pampering after traveling to multiple countries.  The 41 did NOT disappoint.  The staff was genuinely welcoming and helpful, the hotel room was comfortable and beautifully decorated, and the main salon was a great place to sit and refresh.  My husband and I plan look forward to staying at The 41 again when we visit London.  I loved this boutique hotel!"
August 2017,The only place i will stay in London,Undoubtedly one of the best hotels in the world in terms of exclusivity and exquisite treatment to customers. The details that make the stay unforgettable are innumerable. For a London feeling this is the place!
September 2017,Always wonderful,"Hotel 41 is a home away from home, and we love staying here. Book as far in advance as possible as it is very popular. We worry about writing a review in case we can't get in next time we're in London - we certainly wouldn't stay anywhere else given a choice. Customer satisfaction is their top priority, and they always succeed."
August 2017,Our second stay - just as awesome as our first!,"otel 41  London  520468664  We stayed here about 3 years ago and loved it so much we gave friends a voucher as a birthday gift. When they couldn't use it, they returned the voucher to us and off we went back to Hotel 41. Staying here is a truly a classically enjoyable experience in what great service ought to be. A small hotel occupying one floor of a building, they have a handful of rooms and a large staff so they can offer really exceptional service. I felt as if there was no ""nickle and diming"" you - snacks and beverages are available all day in the Executive Lounge where you can enjoy a great buffet breakfast. At night, they offer turndown service and will tidy up the room again and provide fresh towels. They place bottled water each evening by the bed. We loved being able…"
September 2017,Superb,"I've stayed in 5 star hotels around the world, and one question I ponder is, ""what makes a luxury hotel different?""  I think it could be how comfortable and welcome they make you feel as a guest.   Here are some ways Hotel 41 does that: 1. Staff is waiting in the lobby to escort you to check in. You are offered a cold (or warm) drink, and taken care of immediately. 2. A personal note welcoming you is waiting in your charming room. 3. Among other things in the room: the remote control is in a baggie (they've sanitized it!), water waiting by the bed, a candle lit in the bathroom, heated towel racks--honestly, anything you could think of, it's there. And if it's not? They will get it for you. I needed a curling iron with a UK plug. I had it in less than 5 minutes. 4. The staff all…"
September 2017,What's The Difference That Makes The Difference?,"Rather than wax lyrical about the superb furnishing of the hotel, the perfect location and the unparalleled quality of customer care and service, and rather than replicate the many fine words of praise set down by others, I thought I'd try to highlight what for me, makes staying at Hotel 41 so special.    As with my stays at all other hotels, I plugged my phone into the charger overnight, and took it with me on my walks about town the following day.  On my return I found the lead had been neatly coiled, and a piece of Velcro helpfully attached to keep it that way.  (Please see photo).  I know it's only my opinion but for me, this is a perfect example of what the whole Hotel 41 experience is about - the efforts made by a team of people to anticipate my needs and satisfy them…"
August 2017,Customer Service x 1000.,"As the hotel management intern from Portugal said, ""This hotel takes customer service to a new level. There is not better place I could learn."" From the moment we arrived, we felt like we were being waited on hand and foot. We needed a bathroom in which to change after arriving from an overnight flight...We were given a room! We then came back from a tour and could hardly stay awake after being up 24 hours 9( bad flight). It was not yet check-in time. They gave us a room in which to take a nap! Look at the photos and see what they offer, but you cannot see from words or photos what extraordinary customer service they provide. Other things we loved: We were within walking distance from Buckingham Palace-across from the Mews. Wonderful, safe location near lots of restaurants.…"
December 2016,Bliss,"I happened to stumble upon this hotel by accident but am I glad I did! We have our annual '41' stay each year leading up to Christmas and I look forward to it all year. We have stayed in rooms and suites and can honestly say that it is top class. Nothing is too much trouble. Guests are treated like royalty and the staff go out if their way to make sure your stay is special. From the complimentary champagne on arrival to the little treats they leave in your room, so far we have had a birthday cake, basket of fruit, wine and a signed photo from the cast of wicked when we went to see it a couple if years ago. We love the executive lounge and the honesty bar and last time, we were sent home with a goodie bag for the train journey home! Please don't change anything, you are perfect!…"
August 2017,Details are priority,This hotel goes above and beyond for all guests. The vibe of just checking in the hotel is a vintage royal English welcoming with a glass of Champagne and some chocolates waiting in your room. I was impressed by the towel warming racks in the restroom. They basically do everything they can to make you feel at home. I stayed in a Executive King room which was perfect for 2 people. If you have a lot of luggage you might have to think about upgrading. We had room service on both nights we stayed because most pubs in the area closed at 11. Thank you to the staff  that went above and beyond while we stayed there.
August 2017,Perfect experience!,"My daughter and I vacationed here for several days.  The hotel is gorgeous, but what made it an exceptional experience was the efficiency, kindness and friendliness of the staff!  The afternoon tea is not to be missed.  The presentation was lovely and the treats delicious.  In addition, their ""plunder the pantry"" is a generous and thoughtful way to welcome travelers weary from a long journey.  The little extras such as the turndown service in the evening also made for a perfect vacation.  Very memorable!"
August 2017,exceptionalpersonalized service,"The warm and friendly  staff delivered exceptional service, They realized my daughter was entering university shortly and provided her a surprise congratulatory decorated cake!  Small details were all looked after and their timing for fulfilling any request was outstanding. They were engaging without any feeling of being overbearing."
August 2017,A Wonderful Oasis,"My wife and I stayed here for our 30th wedding anniversary and were extremely impressed. From the moment we arrived, we felt genuinely welcome. And of course, it is the staff that make or break a hotel, and they were all excellent. The pink champagne on arrival, the special cake in our room, were lovely touches. The Executive Lounge, which is in the style of a Gentleman's Club, was a great place to relax, and to have breakfast. It truly is an oasis of calm in Central London. Number 1 for a reason, and thoroughly recommended."
August 2017,We Have a New Family at Hotel 41,"My husband and I just spent 9 days in London and had the best time of our life.  Hotel 41 was perfect.  The location, the service, the food, the drinks and most of all the friendships that were made with all the staff.  When we left, we felt like we were leaving family.  Before we came to London we had never been treated like royalty, but we now have.  Next time we go to Europe, we will spend a few days or more at Hotel 41."
August 2017,Lovely place,We wanted to stay some where that was elegant .We found it. Lovely people .they will go out of there way to help you. A place like home. Easy access and parking. A lot to see from here too. Will come here again if we can afford it.
August 2017,Stay like Royalty,"We started our week long trip to London in a flat.  We wanted to stay in London like we were living there, but why stay like a commoner when you can live like royalty at Hotel 41.  Looking over the Royal Mews while staying at one of the most exclusive addresses in London.  The staff was excellent and every person was engaging and willing to help.  It is really a notch above other hotels we have stayed at.  The Executive Lounge makes the stay perfect as it is always ready to get you anything you may need."
August 2017,It is not a hotel ...... but home,"My wife and I travelled from Hong Kong to London on vacation. We stayed in this hotel just for the 17th to 18th August.   Here is not much to say and of course no need to say much but:  'It is not a hotel but a home for every traveller'!!  Thanks to the front desk (both day and night shifts), social manager, all servers, house keeping team and everybody there. We support its environmentally-friendly practices as well. The only thing to remind is we have not pay attention is there something like a 'door-bell' or phone at the front door because if someone whose room card does not function, he or she may have difficult to get back into the hotel in the night.   We probably will not be in London in the near future. If we visit London again, Hotel 41 is our first choice. If the staff…"
July 2017,Best Hotel Stay Ever!!,"I can not begin to say how much I enjoyed my stay at the Hotel 41 in July 2017!  This was by far the best hotel I have ever stayed at in the world!  The experience begins at the front door, continues at check-in and the executive lounge, with it all coming together in the Junior Suite.  I cannot compliment enough the entire staff who bent over backwards to take care of me.  Thank you very much!!"
October 2016,The best!!!,"A long overdue review but I had to share that this is the best home away from home in London! My 14 year old daughter and I stayed for a week last October and had such a great time. The hotel is located just next to Buckingham Palace and is an easy walk to lots of sites. You can see into the ""mews"" from the hotel windows and it's a few minute walk if you tour Buckingham Palace. The tea and daily breakfast are delicious and the nightly treats make the evening a fun adventure. The hotel helped us with dinners and transportation as well, and when they found out we were going to see the Harry Potter play they left special witch hat cupcakes for us in our room. Just one of the many special things about staying at Hotel 41. Thank you to everyone there! "
August 2017,Excellence with warmth,"This hotel has set a new bar for me when traveling. The decor is lovely, the food is great, the beds are wonderful, the baths are outstanding - but the staff. The staff is the very best part. Steve Jones in particular went so far above making my teenage son welcome and delighted, it made his trip. No effort was too small, they were always polite, helpful, and kind. This hotel has the kind of polish of the very best service without ever feeling stuffy, and is right across from the palace. Tea time is one of the many delights I highly recommend - the open pantry is stellar. I cannot wait to plan my next stay here."
August 2017,"Awesome hotel, great staff, perfect location",Location puts you in perfect walking distance to all the sights.  The hotel is a boutique that had the best staff of the four different hotels we stayed at in the U.K.  reception area serves as a hub for anything you need.  Rooms were very nice and ultra clean.  Will be back for business trips for sure.
August 2017,The best hotel in the world,"We love Hotel 41 so much. We have stayed there for 13 nights and it was amazing. We were treated on arrival with a lovely glass of champagne which was the best way to start our holidays. Adele and Magdalena were very friendly during the check in process and accomodate all our needs. They also shown us few rooms to choose from to make sure we could  pick our favorite. All the breakfast team are very friendly. Special mention to Alex, Jerry, Marta, Dean and Stefan. The breakfast offering is incredible. Fresh pastries, Smoked fish, cured meat and a large a la carte menu to choose from. The front desk are so helpfull arranging all our needs, Florent, Lauren, Mitchell, Nicole, Victoria, Moreno were all wonderful and have made our stay so special and perfect.  The room was fantastic.…"
July 2017,My new favorite hotel,"We have stayed at hotels all over the world.  We prefer somewhat quirky boutique hotels and 41 Hotel fits that description perfectly.  The location is marvelous (just across the street from Buckingham Palace).  Our ""Junior Suite"" had a sitting room with fireplace and a flight of stairs up to a space with a desk and a good size bedroom and bathroom.  The furnishings and decor were lovely.  The room was immaculate.  Most important, the staff is absolutely wonderful.  We were known by name within minutes of our arrival.  There is food available in a large common room 24 hours a day.  Late buffet dinners there (included in the tariff) were delicious and perfect for jet lagged travelers (us) who returned late from theatre on several nights.  The entire staff went out of their ways to…"
July 2017,Impeccable Boutique Hotel in the Heart of London,"My wife and I celebrated our 10th anniversary in London. We chose Hotel 41 based on the many fantastic reviews on Trip Advisor. We were treated to impeccable service by all the staff from the moment we arrived to our departure. The staff is courteous, helpful, friendly, with a mixture of flair and British reserve. Our room was perfect, with a very comfortable bed, plenty of drawer and closet space. The bathroom had a bathtub/shower combination as well as a separate shower. Excellent water pressure and plenty of hot water for a long shower after a day of sightseeing. There is a lovely main sitting room which also doubles as a breakfast area, afternoon tea, dinner and late snack. The wait staff is attentive and caters to your requests. The hotel is perfectly situated with…"
August 2017,A secret hideaway right in the middle of bustling London…,"...that also happens to be the #1 hotel in the entire city (out of thousands of options).  We just returned from our third stay at Hotel 41 and were more impressed than ever.  While they’ve been #1 for years, it seems that they are actually getting better each stay.  They have somehow perfected the art of making a hotel feel like your home - that is, if your home is extremely posh and manned by the most helpful and friendly staff to be found.  The service is unmatched and well deserving of the five-star rating.  Perhaps most importantly, this is all delivered without any trace of pretension.  This is a place you can feel truly comfortable on your vacation.  We were only in town for two nights and had a lot packed into our schedule.  The staff arranged two cars, loaned us a temp…"
July 2017,Dropped in for tea,"Actually just dropped in for tea here as a bit out of my budget, but couldn't resist and pushed the holiday budget to be able to stay one night! It was perfect, and don't regret going there for a second. highly recommend"
May 2017,Pure luxury!- All that we had dreamed of and more! 💗,"We celebrated our 20th anniversary with our first trip to the UK in May. Hotel 41 was our home base for a weeklong packed trip which included long day excursion trips in England and Wales, every single day. This resulted in us not seeing much of London as planned our first day, due to a delayed flight. When staff learned that we were unable to see much in London, they presented us with a lovely book about London which was very sweet! The pampering we received when we returned every evening was so nice!  The bedding is extremely comfortable which was very important to me. The room was appointed beautifully, and treats were always left for us upon our return. The delicious after 7 ""plunder the pantry"" was a lifesaver for us as we were too exhausted for anything else. Anything you…"
August 2017,The BEST of the BEST!,"We chose  Hotel 41 for our stay in London based on all of the wonderful reviews.  This hotel was absolutely over the top with the most outstanding service we have ever received.  From the wonderful Check-In reception to the consummate host of the dining room, we were made to feel so at home and extra special. The public rooms of the dining and bar area are so inviting and our observatory guest room was such a great surprise.  Thank you to the management and each outstanding employee for making this hotel so outstanding and our stay so exceptional.  We will definitely be using Hotel 41 when our travels take us to London!!!!!! Thank you, Rick Fisher  Miami"
August 2017,Brilliant hotel - staff excellent,"So we took a punt, our usual and regular hotel in the vicinity had no rooms so we had to find another.  When you arrive don't miss the entrance between Bbar and the Rubens Hotel, but if you do err, then the staff at the Rubens will redirect you.  Once inside you are presented with a well appointed wood panelled corridor and a concierge desk.  The concierge will call up to get you escorted to the 5th floor, you will be treated by a polite and knowledgeable member of staff who tells you ""all the magic happens on the 5th floor"", and it really does.    it is all a little mysterious on first encounter, but all will become familiar quickly  You are escorted to the lounge which is also home to reception, where you are offered complementary champagne from a range of four on offer.  The…"
August 2017,Hotel 41,"Hotel name is very nice 41 and my lucky number was there so like name and aslonthey provide better service than most other hotel there so I like prefer to say please go there and yourself, and they give 5 rating out of 5.."
August 2017,Outstanding! Possibly the best place I have ever stayed. Easily top 2.,"The service here is already well documented (and deservedly so because it is out of this world) so I'll just get right to the second best highlight of our stay. We almost didn't book the 41 because of what looks to be missing. No bar, no restaurant, no meeting space. Luckily we let the location (across from the Royal Mews) and the reviews override our initial thoughts and booked anyway. There is NOTHING missing here. The lounge at the center of the hotel is a chameleon or transformer of a room that turns into whatever you need when you need it. Great bar, tea room, breakfast area, lunch/snacks, place to meet, whatever you want it to be it is. I know I said I wasn't going to rehash the service but....THE SERVICE!!!! Just incredible. So welcoming, so accommodating, so friendly. It…"
July 2017,#1 for a Reason,"We had the good fortune to stay at the 41 for 4 days last month. Our visit was nothing short of spectacular. The hotel feels like a luxury private residence with impeccable service and over the top service. A shout out to Magdalene,Andrew,Steve(a history buff like me) and Lauren(for the amazing upgrade on our last night). Its been almost  3 weeks since we've been home and we're still talking about the service details that separate the 41 from any previous hotel. 5 stars is in insult to this property...we are already making plans to come back. Bravo 41!!!"
May 2017,'Mini-moon' - one night stay,We stayed for one night just after we got married to have a little 'us' time as we had a large amount of guests from abroad staying in London for our wedding. The level of service is exceptional and the room decor and quality is true luxury. The free food at supper time is amazing and free champagne on arrival oh and the free ice-cream! - everything is just fantastic - We loved it - and just what we needed after a hectic wedding schedule. Was tempted to book another night but we had family obligations the next day that we couldn't get out of. I guess the only slight limitation is that there is only one communal area - the 'lounge' where you eat breakfast and which is fantastic but there are no views out of the windows in the bedrooms or the lounge so you do feel a little…
June 2017,Excellent location,"This is our second stay at the Hotel 41 and everytime, it is perfect.The design is classical and the whole building is perfctly renovated.  We really appreciated the welcome of the staff (florent). Our room was beautiful and very confortable."
July 2017,Simply Top Notcg,A true luxury hotel in every sense of the word. Outstanding facilities and the entire team could not have done more for us.   The location is central to all things London. And returning after a day on the town to the Hotel 41 Lounge is a marvelous way to conclude the evening.   The staff members we encountered went out of their way to insure everything we desired was provided and they were genuinely nice people.   I won't stay anywhere else in London after experiencing 41! 
July 2017,Our third visit ... Flawless!,"It was an absolute pleasure to return to this coveted gem. No need to go into the details because other guests have covered all the details.   My husband and I really appreciated being able to freshen up after the long flight by having access to a special room reserved for early arrivals.   Even though I tried 3 weeks prior to our stay, I was unsuccessful in obtaining SkyGarden tickets due to it being the busy summer season. I had communicated my disappointment via email to Hotel 41 stating how difficult it is to obtain these passes - I even tried as soon as they opened up the reservation window. It was a complete surprise to have found out upon our arrival that reservations were made for afternoon lunch at Darwin Brasserie at SkyGarden. Hotel 41 kindly provided a credit on our…"
July 2017,I love this hotel!,"Everything about this hotel is superior.  The hotel is located right next to Buckingham Palace, and our room was lovely, quiet, and comfortable.  The staff is amazing!  Every member of the staff that we came into contact with was friendly, helpful, and welcoming.  I appreciate being allowed to check in several hours early after our overnight flight from the US."
July 2017,Simply Amazing,"My family and I stayed here for 9 days. As you step through the doors you are greeted by the gorgeous interior and amazing staff. You'll be ushered up to the 5th floor to the Executive Lounge where you will enjoy a glass of champaign of your choosing and hors d'Oeuvres. The staff is at your beck and call the entire stay and strive to treat each guest like royaltiy. Even the children!   Once you have recieved your royal welcome, you will be lead to your room. What a room it is! We had two, each just as gorgeous as the next. Each night you will enjoy turn down services and special treats left by housekeeping such as a variety of snacks, bottled water both sparkling and flat, lip balms, relaxing pillow sprays and more.   Our children, 16 and 13 years old, loved the Executive Lounge…"
July 2017,"Best Service Ever ,  Anywhere","A different Hotel  than most fine luxury hotels  .  Everything you might expect from a top rated hotel , with one major  exception , the service was better than any hotel I have ever stayed in .  No matter what you asked for , it was done in a gracious , and experienced manner . I would suggest that you stay in a suite with the separate sitting room . You will not believe this hotel , and it has a wonderful location , being next to Buckingham Palace . The Royal Mews are across  the street , and it is worth the visit ."
May 2017,"""Secret"" hotel with wow factor service","You aren't supposed to reveal secrets, but this one is hard to keep. Enter the lobby and take the lift up to the lounge, you will be transported to an environment stripped of the London hustle and bustle. As you enter you are offered a beverage while your rooms in being arranged and once you sit down with your drink any stress from traveling or running around London just seems to drift away in the timeless turn of the century London interior. The rooms are what you expect from a high end boutique hotel. Great beds, luxury linens and toiletries - it's all there. What makes it stand out from the rest is the staff who outdo themselves at every chance they get, 24 hours a day, with everything from skilled bartenders to creative chefs. Best of all is the lounge staff who will sort…"
July 2017,"Great boutique hotel, intimate may be a bit too intimate.",I booked this hotel because of the ratings & rave reviews from the guests. I booked it despite that there weren't bigger rooms available. We booked into the Executive King suite and it was really very small. We hardly had any room to put anything away and we were spilling out of the room by the end of our stay. The bathroom especially is very tiny and had very limited room to put your toiletries in between two people. I had to leave all my stuff on the desk which cluttered that space and made it messy. The plumbing is also quite old and the water faucet that controls temperature was broken and fiddly. The water didn't drain well which is a pet peeve of mine.  It was a mistake booking here in a standard room & a bad judgment call on my part as in general we do tend to value space…
June 2017,BEYOND EXCELLENT! Simply superlative and more,"I usually don't post on Trip Advisor because frankly I find it a place where folks overhype a place or have an ax to grand and rarely use it as a once source for my travel needs. This one is an exception. This boutique luxury hotel is mind-blowing in terms of service and taking care of one's unique travel needs. If you need to be near Buckingham Palace or Victoria Station, there is no choice but Hotel 41. On this trip I needed all type of different stuff that I usually do - dry cleaning, pressing, ice cream at 2:45 am, tux pick up and return, even a haircut and beard trim. No request was not met with a same. The executive lounge is you private pantry and bar and is stocked with liquors you never heard of. I have done a fair amount of traveling and always been disappointed when a…"
June 2017,Amazing Visit,"My wife and I recently visited London for our 20th wedding anniversary.  You can easily read other reviews regarding the convenient walking distance to theaters and eateries, places along the Thames, the luxuriously comfortable rooms, and the beautiful lounge with pantry and evening fare with the availability of top shelf alcoholic beverages.  But it is the service that is second to none.   From the minute you arrive, you are treated as if you are part of a private club where old friends are glad to see you. Upon return from the show Wicked, we had two delicious cupcakes in our room and a playbill picture signed by the lead.  One night they even had an anniversary cake and champagne waiting for us in our room.  The top notch staff could not have been more informative, personable…"
June 2017,2nd Stay and still exceptional!!!,"We overnighted in London on June 3rd and decided to once again pick Hotel 41. Exceptional comfort, service, location, style just across the road from Buckingham Palace Mews. My husband is still raving about the water pressure in the shower. This hotel is basically our go to whenever we visit London forever more!!!!"
June 2017,"Exceptional service, style, comfort in the heart of London","My wife and I recently visited London for some business followed by a few days of vacation. After my conference finished we stayed three nights at Hotel 41.  We were not disappointed.    The hotel is on the 5th floor of another hotel, the Rubens, with a separate street entrance through which you pass by a desk into a short hallway leading to an elevator.  The entrance is staffed throughout the day until midnight by a very engaging man who we enjoyed chatting with daily as we came and went.  Our luggage was brought to our room while we registered.  We were brought to the executive lounge and a glass of champagne (several choices offered) was provided.  The lounge is reasonably spacious and very comfortable with a ""pantry"" located in one corner stocked with a variety of foods…"
June 2017,Excellent Stay,"Excellent stay rin a room that was  exceptional . The staff were the best we have ever had the pleasure to encounter, friendly courteous that you could not find fault with. Nothing was ever to much trouble, they made our stay in London all the more enjoyable. The pantry that was always on offer served excellent food and treats that were complimentary.  Breakfast was amazing , best scrambled eggs have ever had."
June 2017,Amazing hotel,This hotel is very special indeed...if you want sheer luxury with amazing staff then this the place to stay. Its 5 star which really does go above & beyond for your stay. We had a 3 night stay with a room with views of the Royal Mews it was the best bed i have ever slept in. The food/service/staff awesome. We can't wait to visit again.
August 2016,41 Has Redefined Hospitality,"The Hotel 41 has entirely redefined Five-Star Hospitality!  Some friends had told me about the Conservatory Suite at 41, and following some research, I asked my travel agent to book it for my week in London.  I will never be able to thank those friends enough!  Although branded separately, 41 is actually the most exclusive rooms available at the Rubens at the Palace, and is directly across Buckingham Palace Road from the Royal Mews, which are the stables and garages of Buckingham Palace.  The parlor of the Conservatory Suite looks directly through the gate of the Mews.  There is a very small entry-way from the street, and an elevator will takes you straight up to the fifth floor, and the Executive Lounge.  There really isn't a ""front desk"" just a little table in the corner of…"
June 2017,Grandest Hotel Visit,"Upon arrival at 41, we were treated to a hotel tradition of champagne.  We chose the Queen's favorite, which was exquisite. As we sipped our champagne,  we perused the fantastic library. When we arrived in our room, there was a fresh basket of fruit and a plate of chocolates.  Snacks were available in the library as well as drinks. Hourderves were served prior to dinner. All of this was included in the price. The staff was exceptional.  On the phone, there is a button for ""whatever/ whenever"". If travelling to London, this is the hotel to stay at. I will definitely be returning!!!"
June 2017,Classic Elegance,"We recently returned from our third stay at Hotel 41.  As always it was amazing!  The staff works together to ensure that the guests' visits go smoothly.  We likened it to some swans we saw on a small river near Southampton.  The current was fairly swift, but the swans appeared to be beautiful and calm.  We know their feet were paddling quickly to stay in place.  The staff at this hotel are constantly working behind the scenes to make sure guests are treated with courtesy and efficiency.  We owe a special debt of gratitude to Adele.  We already have the hotel booked two more times in the next year."
June 2017,It doesnt get any better than this!!,"From the moment you walk in, the staff truly treats you like family. I've travelled a lot and this hotel is head and shoulders above many. Hotel 41 sets the benchmark for all other hotels to aspire to. The room was breathtaking and the decor was first class. Location is exceptional with everything right out your door. If staying in London, look no further. Hotel 41 will be seeing us over and over again. What an amazing group of people! "
July 2017,As wonderful as we remembered,"This was our second visit to Hotel 41, two years after our original visit. Hotel 41 was as wonderful as we remembered. Their service and attention to detail is unparalleled.  We arrived about 11:00 AM after our overnight flight from the U.S. via driver arranged by the hotel. The staff welcomed us with the traditional welcome champagne and quickly checked us in. We were pleasantly surprised that our room – upgraded to a junior suite – was ready in less than fifteen minutes.   Our room contained a lovely fruit plate to welcome us. Alas, the temptations of the Executive Lounge, with its morning breakfast and the evening “plunder the pantry”, made it difficult for us to fully consume the generous contents, which were updated daily.  At our request, the staff had recommended and…"
May 2017,Brilliant hotel,"We love this hotel! It is just like a club, revolving around the executive lounge. We stayed here for 3 nights and were very sad to leave. The staff members were absolutely brilliant. We had many great chats with the staff members in the lounge that made us feel so at home. Our room was extremely comfortable, although we could not get the separate shower to work, so we used the shower over the bath instead. The location near Buckingham Palace and St James's Park was superb. The food in the lounge was very good and plentiful. I loved the 'plunder the pantry' in the late evening and also the many snacks which came with our drinks.  We are returning to London for 2 nights in September, but sadly, will not be staying at 41 as it is booked out for our dates, proof of what a great…"
July 2017,They make magic happen...,"Just back from our second visit to this remarkable, glorious hotel.  Calling it a hotel doesn't seem right.  It's more a private club, a home from home where, just like at Hogwarts, magical creatures (called the staff) work away to meet your every need and wish, usually before you were even aware of that need.  Amazing. From checking in sipping a choice of four champagnes, to the beautifully appointed rooms (those beds are soooo comfy), to the perfection that is the Executive Lounge, to the wee surprises awaiting your return after an evening in the second best city in the world (I'm a Londoner by birth and upbringing, but now live in the best of all cities, Edinburgh 😊).  The purpose of our visit was to attend the third of Adele's concerts at Wembley. Waking up on Saturday…"
June 2017,They treat you like Royalty!,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel 41 for my 65th birthday.  They treat you like Royalty!  The service is outstanding and they even had a birthday cake and a card in my room upon arrival! The food in the Executive Lounge is outstanding....and it is available for breakfast, lunch, tea, dinner and after-dinner heavy snacks.  The service in the Executive room is impeccable.  The location of the hotel was perfect for us as we could easily walk to the Royal Mews, Buckingham Palace, and even Big Ben, Parliament, Westminster Abbey, and the Churchill War rooms.  The rooms had every amenity and were very clean and well serviced.  Everything about the hotel was luxury."
June 2017,Perfect!,"Lost count of the number of times we have stayed at 41 over the last 5 years and we keep coming back because it's the best hotel we have ever experienced.  The team are exceptional in the way they care for their guests.  A few examples on this trip were; being taken up on the roof with champagne to watch the flypast for trooping of the colour, being left a thoughtfully prepared gift in the room the night before we went to see a concert, are just a few of the reasons why we return. It's great to see so many familiar faces in the 41 team each time we return and they greet you with genuine warmth.  They are all great fun and are encouraged to be themselves, not to interact with the formal stuffiness you can experience in other luxury hotels. It feels unfair to single anyone out as…"
August 2016,My new London home,"A small boutique hotel directly opposite Buckingham Palace. I loved this place. The staff went out of their way to make me feel special. I have NEVER had service like this before in my life. The rooms were gorgeous but, be warned, they are in a converted terrace house so are small, dark and oddly shaped at times. Quirky definitely works as a description. I still really enjoyed it as the rooms were very unique. The breakfast was superb and the ice-cream freezer available 24 hours a day was fantastic! Love it when hotels do something a little different. Can't thank everyone on staff enough. I had a sensational stay and felt like the most important person in the world."
June 2017,First class hotel,"This hotel does not have a pool or golf course, but I'll match its service level with any world class hotel I have stayed at, and I've stayed at the tops hotels around the world.  The staff is very well trained with personal attention to all your needs.  The hotel is located at the heart of London with very tight security.  We felt very safe, which is important especially with recent terrorist attacks in London.  Well don!"
June 2017,Our new London home!,"Very small boutique hotel with only 28 rooms and a 2 to 1 staff to guest ratio.  Simply the best and most personalized service anyone could ask for.  All of the staff know your name and room number and remember all of your preferences.  We had a problem with the bathroom sink faucet on the second day, and it was taken care of immediately with a complimentary bottle of wine as an apology. Beautiful classic atmosphere and first class accommodations.  Worth every penny spent.  We will be back.  Maitre'ds Stephan Otto and Andrew Muir were fantastic as was all of the staff.  Can't wait to come back."
June 2017,The MOST incredible experience ,"Our stay at Hotel 41 for the weekend was simply amazing. From being greeted at the front door to anticipating our every need, we experienced a weekend that was truly unforgettable. The service and genuine care you receive from the staff is exquisite. We highly recommend this hotel experience to maximize your time in London. And we will be back. "
June 2017,"Excellent service, incredible location","The service at Hotel 41 is just wonderful. We stayed there for three nights, and the small service touches were nice, e.g. they took the time to ask whether we were vegetarian (my wife is) and then the chef made a separate appetizer for her over the complimentary afternoon snacks.  The location is perfect if you are there as a tourist -- one block from Buckingham Palace, and easy walking distance to Big Ben, The National gallery, and much more, and one block from the tube. Their executive lounge is perfect to relax with great light food (complimentary) and drinks. The price of the hotel (it is a bit on the expensive side) was worth it.  However, this is still London, where space is at a premium. So the rooms are not large, and the executive lounge is cosy as opposed to grand.…"
May 2017,You have to stay here,"This hotel is amazing, every part of it is a wonderful experience and worth the value. I can't ever imagine staying anywhere else while in London! I wish every hotel operated like this one. Thank you for the wonderful time! "
May 2017,Unbelieveable Experience,"In traveling many places in the world, we have not experienced such outstanding accommodations as we did during our stay at Hotel 41. First, it's location is just down the street from Buckingham Place, and is convenient to most attractions. Hotel 41 has a limited number of rooms, which convey the feeling of being special. To that point the service and  dedication to detail is without approach. The quality of the dining was excellent. The staff was very friendly and responded to every need, truly professional. If you desire the best, Hotel 41 should be your selection! Glenn & Kae Erickson, Danville, California, USA"
May 2017,Wonderful stay after a memorable afternoon at a Royal garden Party,"From the moment we arrived nothing was too much trouble for the incredible staff at Hotel 41. We were made to feel like part of the family. The personal service extended to friends who joined us for drinks before supper. Our room was beautiful, light and airey with candle as part of the turn down service. Canapes and snacks were plentiful and delicious. We will certainly return for a special occasion"
May 2017,The Best Hotel In The World,"This was the best hotel stay I've ever experienced.  It is a smaller hotel, so you feel pampered and taken care of with a personal touch from every employee who all greet you with a smile.  The staff are courteous and quick to respond to any issue or request.  Rooms are luxurious and 5-star quality all around, no issues of cleanliness or missing amenities (and if you did need anything, again the staff is on call and eager to assist you).  The Executive Lounge for breakfast, drinks, afternoon tea, or late night snacks is an ornate room with classic and elegant decor.  Located in beautiful Westminster just opposite Buckingham Palace's Royal Mews, fine dining and beautiful sightseeing is just minutes away on foot.  Victoria Station for Underground service is only a short walk as…"
May 2017,High standards maintained!!!,We stayed here again during our 2nd trip to London and had the same quiet room 4109.  The staff anticipated our every need.  The lounge where breakfast is served is great.  The location is very central to call areas of London as fellas walking distance to Victoria station.
May 2017,Favorite Hotel and Staff!,"Hotel 41 is our favorite Hotel ever and everywhere!  Beautiful Boutique Style and the Staff - AMAZING!  This was our second visit and we can't wait to go back.  Perfect location too!!!! We walked to see the changing of the guard, palace and many other tourist attractions.  The food and wine selection is delicious too!  Oh and most important the BED WAS SO COMFY COZY!"
May 2017,Best Hotel and staff ,"Beautiful small hotel with one of the most amazing staffs ever!  They were so responsive, helpful and friendly....like none I have ever encountered before!  We loved the entire experience and will definitely make this our hotel in London!"
May 2017,Amazing Hotel and service,My wife and I just spent a night here for a wedding anniversary and had a wonderful time. All the staff were very helpful and polite. We stayed in the Monarch suite which I highly recommend. Amazing food in an amazing building with great staff. If you are in London this is the place to stay! 
May 2017,Great Hotel in London,"Hotel 41 located in London is a gem in a city with hundreds of highly ranked hotels. This hotel should have a 10 star rating as it trumps most of the big name places. My wife and I were in London for seven days and very happy that we chose Hotel 41. The service, and personal attention that this hotel gives its clients is over the top. The staff was very helpful and always went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of.   Hotel 41 is directly across the street from the Buckingham Palace Royal Mews, and just a short walk away form many other London attractions; Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abby, Big Ben, Houses of Parliament, St. James Park, The Green Park, Trafargar Square, Piccadilly Circus, just to name a few. There are also plenty of restaurants and shopping in the…"
April 2017,I will definitely stay here again,"Stayed here for 5 nights in April 2017 and loved it.  Room was clean, cleverly designed, executive room was really nice and had great food and drink options.  Hotel is well located and has a fantastic atmosphere.  But really, the best thing about this hotel is the staff; I've stayed in a few 5 star hotels before and have often found the attention over-the-top, but the Hotel 41 team offer the perfect level of hospitality  Their staff are intelligent and great at engaging with guests with the right amount of care.  My wife and I joked about Hotel 41 being our new home-away-from-home and I am looking forward to my next visit."
May 2017,Customer Service,"The hotel and rooms are interesting, but frankly, what sets this place apart is customer service. Period. They are focused on you getting the most out of your stay.  The Salon is where all the action is. We didn't do this, but on a rainy, dreary London day, I could imagine spending nearly all of it sitting in the Salon and reading. Probably not the best place for young kids  Great location for all things in Westminster. Loved it"
May 2017,Hospitality at it's very best,"My wife and I spent two very enjoyable nights in this wonderful hotel - actually, it's more like a private club.  From the moment we entered the door, we were treated to very friendly, personal and professional service from every staff member that we met. The ambiance is such that the Executive Club room - where everything takes place - is the perfect place to relax and 'chill out'. There is a comprehensive bar with complimentary snacks available and they offer a meal service as well. At all times, there will be attentive staff waiting to deal with your every whim - they go out of their way to make Hotel 41 feel like a 'home from home'. The rooms are extremely comfortable and well appointed and the power of the shower was something to behold!  This boutique hotel sets the…"
June 2017,Never stayed anywhere like this,We arrived to a very friendly welcome. Efficient check in aided by a glass of champagne. Could not fault the friendly efficient relaxed service. Beautiful room. Excellent breakfast and delicious pantry to help yourself to. We loved every minute. 
May 2017,"great room, great service, great drinks and breakfast","We stayed in room 29, which was a perfect sized room. One of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on. The staff kept bringing little gifts and treats every night, which made our 10 year wedding anniversary very special."
May 2017,We have christened this 'our hotel' in London!,"We had the pleasure of staying in Hotel 41 recently and it was a stellar experience. From the moment we entered, we were treated warmly, and welcomed like family. EVERYONE from start to finish was warm, friendly, and professional. Every single thing we experienced in this hotel was top notch.  When planning our trip to the UK, we used a travel agent who had suggested hotels for each of our venues. Hotel 41 was not the agent-suggested hotel for London, however after doing my own research I was confident that this was the hotel we wanted. The location is excellent, being very close to Buckingham Palace and within walking distance of much that we were interested in seeing in our short (2 night) stay in London. The quality of the service, as others have mentioned, surpasses all…"
June 2017,The best,It's the best without any doubt. Staying somewhere else will be a injustice to London visit. Superb rooms and great location. Service is great. Good is a little expensive. Rest is as a like all reviews says. The best.. u hoo
February 2017,Amazing,"This is the best hotel We have ever stayed in. Staff are excellent, they cannot do enough for their guests. Only one night stay, wished we could have stayed longer. We felt so relaxed and pampered.   Romantic turndown fantastic. Great location.  Everyone should stay here at least once in their lifetime. "
May 2017,Incomparable service... a must!,"Hotel 41 has definitely the best service we have ever experienced among all the very good hotels we have been to. From the moment they welcome you, they are full of warm and heartfelt attentions. Yet without being too much. The staff has been of very good advices which definitely emphasized the quality of our stay in London. Frankly, we have been highly impressed by our experience and will definitely stay there next time around. The hotel is also very well located which makes it even more interesting. It is small, full of charm and truly worth the expense! Enjoy!!"
May 2017,Excellent Service great location,"Had a lovely stay here whilst attending a royal garden party. The location for this was perfect only a short walk from the palace. It's not like any hotel I've previously stayed in because it's located on the fifth floor, accessed by a small lift. The ground floor entrance is very nice and it feels like a private members club, which again is nice. Reception is based within the 'executive lounge' which is a beautiful room with a small split level gallery where you can have some more privacy if wanted. We were greeted very well with a complimentary glass of fizz ( four to choose from!) service on the whole during our stay was very good in deed save for a couple of minor issues. Firstly, our WHB tap was loose and they failed to fix it after I'd reported it. Secondly there was a…"
May 2017,It is without doubt the best hotel in london,"Hotel 41 is a wonderful small hotel near Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station. It´s location makes it very easy to reach the interesting locations of London very easy. Hotel 41 and its staff offer the best service that you can imagine. There is a wonderful and warm welcome each time we arrive. The rooms are perfectly designed in black and white. The turn down service is perfect - water provided for the night, a small sheet of paper with the weather forecast and tips for the next day. The breakfast offers either a buffet or a typical English breakfast - be careful if you order it - it is huge! We aleays love the conversation with the staff. There is always the feeling that the staff is really interested that everything is okay. It remains the best hotel in London."
July 2017,Cannot wait to visit again,"This was my third stay at Hotel 41 and yet again it did not disappoint on any level. When planning my trip to the UK I knew Hotel 41 would the only place to stay while in London. The service is impeccable but not stuffy and nothing is too much trouble. I love the lounge where one can linger over a pot of tea or a glass of wine and feel as if you were in a private home. Breakfast is served there and it is cosy and unhurried. The staff are friendly and attentive and always have a smile. Love the cosy rooms with every small detail thought of - lots of fluffy towels, a great shower, comfortable bed and floating votive candles in the bathroom with the turndown service to name a few. I cannot wait for my next stay!!!!"
June 2017,My Favorite Hotel,"My only wish, after staying here on 4 separate occasions, is that they had a Hotel 41 in every city.  It truly is a wonderful hotel with incredible customer service that every hotel should try and attain.  Each year it's great to see familiar faces and also meet new staff.  The rooms are always immaculate and perfectly decorated.  The shower, as some have noted, are perfect pressure.  The sweets and treats and dinner snacks in the Library are always such a wonderful touch.  The service with breakfast and drinks is spot on.  I wish I could provide some constructive feedback but I simply can't.  My entire family loves visiting Hotel 41 and make it a must on any trip to London.   Thank you so much for another wonderful, memorable stay."
July 2017,Simply Outstanding - AGAIN,"If you haven't tried this little Haven of Paradise yet - I would definitely advise it. It's cozy and comfortable, intimate and private. We really truly counldn't ask or wish for anything more. It's completely relaxing and, whether you stay for 1 night or 7, you feel totally relaxed and refreshed.   It's the wonderful staff that makes the difference for us, they are kind, caring, totally professional, discrete and always go above and beyond the call of duty. They're just amazing, Lauren and Stefan are incredible.   The rooms are comfortable and very tastefully decorated, very clean and supplied with high quality accessories. We now wouldn't consider staying anywhere else and can't recommend Hotel 41 highly enough.   We stayed for a special celebration and we can honestly say that…"
July 2017,The best service!,"Hotel 41 is amazing. The level of service was unlike any other five star hotel I've stayed. It's small and intimate so the staff really get to know their guests. They didn't even ask for my name when we showed up for breakfast because they automatically knew. On the first day I asked for softer bread for my young son (instead of sliced sourdough rolls) and I didn't have to remind them on the following days. They just remembered.  Because it's a smaller property, the atmosphere is quite charming, warm and cozy. The Executive Lounge has complimentary snacks/appetizers 24/7.  It was so great to go there after a long day of sightseeing. We would order a drink and graze on the delicious food. As for the room, the beds were very comfortable. The bedding was top notch.  I highly…"
July 2017,A truly excellent experience ,"I cannot recommend Hotel 41 more highly. It excels at the usual stuff: comfy beds, quiet halls, clean rooms, spacious bathrooms, proximity to the sites and quintessential British decor. Where Hotel 41 excels is in its attention to the guest which I must say is without compare. By the time I left several different staff members had undertaken a coordinated effort to ensure that my departure was smooth and that I had plans for the next stage of my journey. Their executive lounge is akin to a club room as a country club in that it has delicious snacks at all hours and the guests hang about making conversation and meeting one another. Most importantly to the experience is a man named Steve Jones whose role includes: hanging out in the executive lounge, being impeccably dressed,…"
July 2017,Beyond Amazing. Staff is truly next level.,"There are 5 star hotels (and I've stayed at dozens) and then there is Hotel 41 which stands a level above, primarily due to the incredible staff and attention to detail.  I stayed in an Executive Room with my eldest daughter who is 7 (she would most certainly say 7 1/2) for six nights and the experience was phenomenal.  Each morning a member of the staff would help my daughter with her hair, another staff member ran out to get Gatorade at 10pm just because I inquired about where I could go buy some, yet another offered me his old backpack he wasn't using any more for my trip home and gave my daughter beautiful jewelry pins that she loved, and another still got her a tiara to wear when we went to see the show Wicked.  But more important than all these things given to us was the…"
July 2017,Magic.,"Simply a magical experience, once again. (Our second stay at Hotel 41 over the past 3 years). We have stayed at many fine hotels, and although great service is expected and often delivered from them all, none of them achieve the level of intimacy and hospitality like Hotel 41. Just a few examples: Greeting your kids by their names, as if they all knew you for years. Getting tickets to theater when already sold out. Getting tickets to a museum exhibit when already sold out (and complimentary to boot). Baking a chocolate fudge cake just for your kids, the following day from when they asked for a piece of chocolate cake, (that wasn't even on the menu).   They just do not accept not being able to provide you what you ask. I have never experienced such dedication to service.   Truly…"
June 2017,Never felt like this before,"I don't even know how to express my sheer delight that I experienced from my stay at this haven in London. From the very beginning to the end the staff, service and general environment was exhilarating. I have never felt so comfortable nor content at any other hotel that I was a guest. Let me just say that this is 5 star to the max. Thank you everyone for your sincere indulgence of this very captivated American."
July 2017,repeat visit,Excellent hotel with best service you can find.   Great location.   Would gladly recommend to all.  Stayed with our 2 teenagers who loved it.   Lounge is like a private club with free food and staff that is first class
July 2017,Fantastic ,"Our second stay at this absolutely brilliant property, as we bookended at cruise through Scandinavia with two stays separated by 8 d  Staff are fantastically attentive, respectful & engaged to make your visit perfect The lounge is a wonderful place to wind up or wind down with while in London Location is ideal for enjoying the city Strongly recommend "
April 2017,A Truly Special Hotel Experience,Everything at Hotel 41 was perfect. The staff were so wonderful and attentive. The room was very comfortable and quiet. Everything you could want was right at your fingertips. The location was perfect. Hotel 41 is a gem of a hotel in a fantastic city. 
April 2017,5 star experience at 41 Hotel,"Booked in December for our April stay and immediately aware this would be a 5 star experience all the way. Easy booking and excellent relevant communication with confirmation and offers of help with anything to make our stay easy and special. A warm welcome on arrival from a team of courteous staff that displayed an interest in our plans without being intrusive. Clearly high calibre, well trained individuals working as a well motivated team. A glass of complimentary champagne  and canapés were a pleasant welcoming touch to start our short break in London. The Hotel is small with less than 30 rooms and the elegant lounge is the hub for check in, bar, refreshments and breakfast. A cosy feel with a Minstrels gallery , high ceiling, historic library and warm wooden furniture. Our…"
March 2017,Red Carnation Collection experience Part 3,"So I've finally arrived at the last of my Red Carnation Hotel trip shenanigans destination and I have to say: yes, I know now why it's voted the No1 Hotel in London on TripAdvisor. Like her other two sister hotels (Egerton and Milestone) the service is impeccable. What makes 41 stands out from the rest of the hotels, is the fact that all the people working at 41 consistently willing to walk that extra mile to make your stay there a magical experience: Champagne accompanied welcoming checking in, in the grand and yet cosy executive lounge. Courtesy room for the guest who checks in early. All the front house people greet you warmly by your name. Beautiful and tasty canapés and ""raid the pantry"" in the evening. I've had the good fortune of meeting the legendary Mrs. T (the lady…"
March 2017,Quite simply a fantastic hotel,"Where do i start, as so many things are just so right about this hotel.  The building - the hotel is tucked away on a higher floor, accessed by a small but beautifully appointed private entrance and lift. A receptionist greets you and then a member of staff takes you up to the hotel and it's wood panelled lounge, very cosy and intimate, to be checked in. Everywhere is clean and nicely styled. The bedrooms are very well appointed, with everything you need, plus lots of things you never even realised you may need!  The staff - are fabulous, just that right balance of friendliness, but not overly familiar. Casual enough to put you at ease, but incredibly efficient with excellent standards of service. I never had to sign a bill once, all the staff seem to know your name and room…"
April 2017,Don't be fooled by the online photos and descriptions,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for 3 nights recently. Considering it was a special occasion, I wanted to book a first class hotel for my family and I. Talking to the hotel reception by phone for reservation purposes, it was suggested a special offer of 3 nights for 2. The price presented to me per night seemed reasonable considering this was a 5-star hotel in London and we booked a suite. Arriving at the hotel was already a disappointment, as we found out Hotel 41 is actually the fifth floor of the Rubens hotel. To summarize our stay, the room was small, considering we booked a two room suite. The bathrooms were tiny - the shower head reached my chest so I had to kneel down to wash my hair. The floors squeaked, the bed was old and sinked in the middle. The other bathroom to the suite was…"
September 2016,Simply Amazing!,This hotel is one of the finest places I've ever stayed in the world! The rooms are luxurious and comfortable. The staff goes out of its way to satisfy. The location is perfect. There are not enough adjectives to adequately describe my experience. The Hotel 41 is #1! Can't wait to go back!
April 2017,Great,Loved the service very helpful staff and were always available if you need anything excellent job I had an excellent experience as I stayed for 2 nights and the server was excellent could not want anything more
February 2017,The Best of the Best.,"Wow! The hotel is in an excellent location.  We were given a free upgrade to a studio room which was amazing! Check in was smooth, bar area was great and breakfast was also brilliant. We're going back in August as it was so good. Central to everything and was a great non-business stay. Stayed in so many great hotels around the world, this will take some beating."
April 2017,The best hotel experience ever!,"Just stayed here in early April.  It's the best urban boutique hotel there is.  I cannot say enough about the ""experience"" of staying here.  It is an experience and feeling you get staying here that I have not had anywhere else and I have been lucky enough to stay at some of the best hotels and resorts.  No detail is too small.  The service and the food is beyond exemplary. We have missed the food and breakfast everyday since getting back from our vacation and can't wait to get back haha. Still looking at pictures of my eggs Benedict haha. Experience everything you can while staying, cocktails, breakfast, the pantry, romantic turndown etc.  it's all worth it and we can't wait to get back and relax in the lounge!  Thanks to all the staff for making our stay so wonderful. "
October 2016,One of the best hotels,My experience has been amazing and would recommend it to my friends. The hotel staff was helpful and made our stay perfect as couple. Hotel interiors are cool and gives you positive vibes when you enter.
November 2016,Best birthday treat EVER,"I live in London but it's always fun to stay somewhere nice, be treated like a queen and play tourist and that's what my friend did for me.  We stayed here the day after my birthday.  From the moment you arrive, the concierge took over, our bags were taken to our room, we were given complimentary drinks and then also escorted upstairs.  I found a huge fruit basket and birthday cake upon arrival and the staff all wished me a happy birthday.  We unpacked, the room wasn't huge but it wasn't small, it felt cosy, the bed high and comfy and a bathroom filled with Penhaligon products. He had booked an afternoon tea in the salon, which is where we went next, it was very nice and the salon itself was lovely, I suppose it could feel crowded if completely full but there were only 2 other…"
February 2017,Wonderful Experience ,"This is the best hotel ever the only hotel where at the end of your break you simply do not want to go home!  I took my daughter Heather for her Birthday as we had tickets for Harry Potter. It is not the first time I have stayed now it is my favourite place.  Everything is superb and consistent on every visit. From the soothing champagne arrival just what you need after the travelling to all the little things they suggest and do through out your stay . I had organised a few birthday surprises a cake made in house, balloons & flowers everything was presented beautifully as requested with great thanks to Flo. From suggesting restaurants, receiving shopping, and organising taxis so very helpful nothing is too trivial for them the attention to detail spot on. The food is lovely very…"
March 2017,An excellent stay at this boutique hotel in the heart of London.,"The small hotel of only thirty rooms is perfect in my opinion. You enter on the ground floor where a receptionist buzzes you in and are taken to the fifth floor for check-in at the concierge desk. We were told to leave our luggage downstairs and were greeted by name when we arrived upstairs. We sat at the desk and were served our choice of champagnes. We were checked in quickly and brought to our room with our luggage already waiting. The rooms was spacious and well appointed. The bathroom was fine, perhaps a little small with a tub/shower combo. We were only there for 3 nights and spent our 2 full days sightseeing away from the hotel. We had continental breakfast the first morning and it and the service were excellent. When we asked for directions to a specific pub for dinner…"
March 2017,This Place Will Ruin You,"I booked this hotel because it looked cool in a picture, seriously, it's not the smartest way to book a hotel. I probably did look at its ratings but I didn't put much thought into it.  Wow, did I luck out! We arrived 3 hours before check in to a champagne toast in a lounge after we were escorted in by the lobby manager. The Lounge is set up like a library in a beautiful mansion with tables and settees that are set with beautiful linens. It boasts a snack area that is stocked 24x7 with chips, ice cream, beverages, and snacks. At night they provide ""light"" fare but you probably could call it a light dinner and not go out.  The morning breakfast is in the same room and all service is impeccable and formal without being stuffy.  We came to our room the first night after dinner to…"
March 2017,Loved it!,Look no further for a wonderful place to lay your head after spending the day in a beautiful and lively city!  Service is impeccable and they are truly happy to help you with anything you need. There were nightly gifts on our bed which was a wonderful touch welcoming us back from a long day being tourists. And as mentioned many times in posts the nightly Plunder the Pantry was a highlight of our day.  Relaxing by the fire in a comfy chair reviewing our day with snacks and beverage of choice. Buckingham palace is right across the street and we were delighted one morning to see the horse and carriages come out for a little walk around.  Also there's a pub across the street where we met locals who loved to chat and a little diner style eatery where we ate most mornings before…
March 2017,Early birthday trip,"Booked this hotel as an early birthday treat, glass of champagne whilst you check in all the staff were amazing attentive without being intrusive,  our room was lovely they left two cup cakes and a card and that night rose petals on the bedside table the turn down service is lovely little gift each night left on the bed which I have to say was huge and very cosy, beautiful breakfast, lots of nice choices very fresh .they do dried fruits, nuts, crisps, popcorn, ice cream scones mid afternoon all free through the day then in the evening they do 'plunder the pantry' cold meats, cheese, little desserts and a hot dish. As I said the staff make this place delightful Steve was charming as was the young man from South Africa and all the girls were dressed extremely smart couldn't do…"
March 2017,Perfection,"How do you define perfection? Well, the beautifully located Hotel 41 in the heart of London comes to mind. This is my daughter and my second stay at the Hotel 41 and to be perfectly honest, I would never stay anywhere else while visiting one of my favorite cities. From our warm reception upon arrival to our final good-byes and all the cherished moments in-between the entire staff helped to create our home away from home. Each mornig heading out after breakfast and armed with travel advice and snacks, it was always a pleasure to return ""home"" after an exciting day to share experiences with the staff who were genuinely interested in our stories. Plunder the Pantry was a brilliant offering and each evening my daughter and I would meet to take part in all the delicious goodies. I…"
February 2017,Absolutely fabulous,"Lost for words really. Everything about 41 was wonderful, the service was excellent and the staff so friendly and obliging. The food was great,surroundings beautiful and rooms couldn't have been better. Every little detail had been thought of and we can't wait to treat ourselves to another visit. Orchard H"
August 2016,Excellent Service,"they offered a coffee and a bag of something that we had to bring with us. like everyone the service is very simply and all. I am with my friends when we go here, my friend occupied a one bedroom to all of us. this place is very luxury but it is worth it."
March 2017,more than 5 star,"Wow- from the moment we arrived we were treated like Royalty. extremely polite and friendly staff. We have over the years stayed in some Fabulous hotels ( Cape Grace SA. Savoy London,+++) none of them go that extra mile that 41 goes to. nothing was too much trouble, we required an ice bucket, 2 minutes later it arrived. needed a reservation for dinner- sorted . The car was looked after very well(Valet Parking)  The stay was for my Birthday and there was a cake waiting for us in the room and Birthday wishes from the staff.I cannot recommend this Hotel highly enough 6 stars would not be enough, we chose the Hotel because of the Trip Advisor reviews and it turned out to be a very good decision.  A huge thank you to all the staff who made our stay probably the best stay that we have…"
June 2016,A Beautiful Place!,"We stayed here as a splurge for one night in London. It was in the perfect location, central to shops, restaurants, and sites in London.The room was clean, quiet, and comfortable and we couldn't have asked for a better stay."
May 2017,"""Whatever, whenever""","Incredible service, staff at your fingertips 24 hours day.  They have thought of everything.   The button on the phone says ""whatever,  whenever "" and they mean it.  Boutique hotel in lovely older building.   Temperature always right, excellent room lighting, and the mattress was more comfortable than mine at home.   The Executive lounge is open 24 hours too with snacks and drinks gratis.  They have spoiled me for staying in a typical hotel ever again. "
May 2017,What Makes A Great Hotel,"There was a mistake with my room.  The hotel could have handled the challenge in a variety of ways, Hotel 41 choose to comp me the night.  It was truly not necessary, but it was a wonderful gesture that turned a mistake into a fan."
April 2017,Perfect start to honeymoon,"Booked Hotel 41 after reading the various great reviews and the fact it was Number 1 on here. It was a treat for the first night of our honeymoon before we flew from Gatwick the next day and we couldn't have wished for a better place to stay. The hotel is beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough for you, they were all fantastic. As it was our honeymoon we got a free upgrade on arrival which was a nice surprise. We also got a bottle of champagne and personalised cakes in our room as well which was amazing and a nice personal touch. The hotel really made us feel special during our stay and we will be returning I'm sure hopefully in the near future. Fully deserving of all the priase the hotel has already recieved and will continue to recieve I'm sure."
May 2017,exquisite stay,we stayed here for a business/leisure trip on 13th May 2017. From the minute we walked through the doors we were knocked out by the fantastic service... We were escorted to the lift and in to the beautiful executive lounge to check in. whlie we did we were offered champagne and because my partner is not keen on champagne  wine was offered.. Steve jones in the lounge is an asset to the hotel. He did everything he could to make sure everything we needed was available to us.. The room was beautifully decorated and the bathroom was kitted out with plenty of toiletries that so many hotels overlook. The service from every member of staff we encountered was the best we have found in all of the hotels we have stayed in... We went to see wicked that evening on our return were 2 cupcakes…
May 2017,Wonderful boutique hotel,"Arrived jet lagged but greeted warmly by the staff and the room was ready for us 2:30 pm.  The suite was on two levels, you climb the stairs to get to the sleeping area and bathroom, the sitting area with another desk/chair and more comfortable chairs were downstairs.  A tray of petit fours and basket of fruit awaited us in the sitting area. The service here is incredible.  Before leaving the US, I had requested by email a foam roller and yoga mat for my back which they provided at no cost.  Also requested that there be a gallon of distilled water for a CPAP machine which they also had in the room at no cost.  Provided a SIM chip and installed it for me at cost (£20 from Vodafone) but forgot to charge me the 5% service charge.  When I reminded them twice about the missing…"
April 2017,Amazing Hotel with Amazing People,"Our memorable stay began with warm greetings  by Nicole at the reception desk and whom escorted us to the Executive Lounge upstairs where we had our check-in, also helped by Lauren. Not to mention Steve, who served us the bubbly Champagne and yummy snacks..  💜 then Florent took it from there to introduce us to the room which was to be ours for a night, the famous Conservatory Master Suite, a must-try for travellers to London! And there awaited us was a beautiful bottle of champagne with the red carnation signature and more handmade savouries! Such a Wonderful Welcome❤ We could not wait for night time to be able to gaze at the stars in the sky just lying from our bed..  When we were about to go out, Maria was very helpful to give us some tips.. During the evening, there was…"
May 2017,second visit,this hotel is a 5 min walk from the thames ideal for the London eye boat trips etc and amazing shops and restaurants the teas coffees etc are so generous as is everything in the room and fresh milk from reception if you need it. also everyone is so friendly and helpful thay cannot do enough for you we run a 5* gold guest house so we are very picky but this place is the best :-)
May 2017,Wow,"Fabulous location, a short stroll to Buckingham Palace.  You are made at to instantly feel at home by charming staff. Fresh fruit is readily available and the bonus of afternoon tea and snacks as well as the "" plunder the pantry"" spread from 8pm adds a huge amount of value. A smart black and white decor throughout, great water pressure, nothing is too much trouble. Understated luxury without the busyness of a large hotel."
May 2017,Hotel 41 is a Winner!,"A great hotel adds so much to our trips.  It is a wonderful place to start every day and a relaxing place to end each day. Hotel 41 was that hotel for us in our recent visit to London.    My wife and I had a wonderful time in our six nights at 41.  The room was very nice, the food was great and the staff was terrific.  There were so many things we liked that is would be difficult to itemize them all, but I will touch on some of the highlights.  We particularly appreciated the availability of a guest room prior to check-in and after checking out of our regular room.  After a long flight from the U.S., the ability to take a nap and freshen up was a key.  The hotel was perfectly situated to launch our daily forays into London.  It was close to dining and only a block away from a…"
May 2017,40th birthday ,"We have travelled a lot for many years and are very picky with cleaning, services and impressions. At our honeymoon we experienced many 5 stars hotels in many countries which all where superb. But we had agreed together that this hotel, Hotel 41 is the best we ever stayed. We loved it from the first to the last minute. "
May 2017,"Great location, amazing service","Hotel 41 is a boutique hotel at the top floor of a classic London building near Buckingham Palace.  Two features make Hotel 41 a really special place:  The incredible level of service, that manages to be efficient, friendly, and attentive to detail (hey they will pack your luggage if you want!)  The executive lounge, a beautiful wood-paneled large lounge with a mezzanine. It is a great place to relax or grab a bite away from the hustle and bustle of the City. They serve breakfast, high tea, and have a full bar + snacks pretty during the whole day."
April 2017,We miss Hotel 41 already,"We spent 8 nights at 41 and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The staff was friendly, engaged and efficient. It was a pleasure to start the day with a fantastic breakfast in the Executive Lounge where the wait staff greeted us with a smile, remembered our names, and offered assistance with our plans for the day. They have truly mastered the art of fine service. The room was spotless, well-appointed with a very comfy bed. Turn down service included nightly treats and the staff provided a special treat related to our visit to the play: Wicked. So very nice and thoughtful. When we return to London, we will stay here again.  I’m really concerned that we’ve been spoiled and no other hotel will live up to Hotel 41."
May 2017,Beyond Belief,"Ah, so you want to spoil your partner to a five star trip into London for their birthday. You might think to go somewhere fashionable like The Savoy or The Ritz. You may do that, but you shall certainly not be treated as well. I assure you. To say the staff are great is useless. These are not staff - they are artists! Hospitality is their craft and it is beyond belief. It's the details. They anticipate your requirements. Exceed them. You never feel like you're on a conveyor belt of care, no. More like an experience of a life time. Many other hotels would do well to study how Hotel 41 perform. Impeccable rooms. Great food and drink. No request is too large or detail to small.   Next time, though, I shall really test them!"
April 2017,Hotel 41 ( 4+1=5star Experiece),"What can I say - fantastic. We made our Easter great by visiting Rome, and on our way back to Dublin we wanted to stay in a top hotel in London. As a surprise I found Hotel 41 on the top of the list, so we decided to try it. Advice: Try it! It was amazing! I will never regret that decision. Lovely room, luxurious in every aspect and everywhere around you! If love luxurious we need to try this one!  "
January 2017,Highly recommended!,Me and my partner had the most fantastic stay here! 5* well deserved. Would highly recommend this to anyone staying in London! Absolute bliss. We had the most fantastic nights sleep in a top room! Brilliant! 
June 2016,25th Anniversary ,Words won't accurately describe this experience. It was other-worldly. I've stayed in many of the nicest hotels around the world and not one comes even close to the quality and service of this hotel. It's just in a different league all its own. Favorite hotel experience of all-time!
March 2017,Excellence,Nothing but fantastic. Beautiful hotel with outstanding services all around. Actually better than our own in NYC....... Stayed only for 11 hours but it was worthwhile to hub. Will return to this landmark Hotel. The Caesar salad in the midst of the night was a wonder.
March 2017,Superb,"This hotel was amazing. If you are accustomed to staying at nice hotels and you anticipate the luxury concierge treatment, this hotel is for you. It is directly across the street from the Royal Mews, which is located on the edge of Buckingham Palace. The nearby South African restaurant has great food as well. I used this as the base of operations and was able to comfortably tube around London. Easy access to Victoria station and then hop on the circle or victoria lines to get where you need to go."
April 2017,In A League Of Its Own,"I'm not so comfortable with the phrase 'home from home'.  Though we have a perfectly nice home life, we don't get waited on hand and foot by delightfully pleasant people who enjoy their jobs; we don't get our requirements anticipated and acted upon; nor do we enjoy such incredible luxury in our bedroom/suite, a turndown service, wonderful surprises popping up here, there and everywhere.  At home, we have a pantry, but nothing to compare to this, and though we have a few bottles, it's nowhere near the superb range available at the bar.  So, 41 is much, much more than home from home, for us anyway.  A mistake was in fact made.  It's not the making of a mistake that marks the quality of an establishment, it's the nature of the response.  And I've never seen anything like this…"
March 2017,The ratings should go up to 6 for this place,"I'm fully aware that this may sound like another gushing review and one must think they put something in the drinks at Hotel 41, but whatever it is I'll gladly have more. You never quite know how good service can be until you stay here. First, we were immediately upgraded to a nicer suite. There was a lovely fireplace and a little lounge space with champagne on arrival, a huge bed and fantastic bathroom with a bath and superb shower and all the little extras I wouldn't even have thought to ask for! The executive lounge is where it all happens, whether relaxing in front of the fireplace or under the astounding globe centrepiece, we were treated like old friends. They seem to have struck the perfect balance between being friendly and utterly attentive without being intrusive.…"
March 2017,Amazing service ,"Like everyone has alluded to, the service here is simply second to none. From emailing us before our arrival in London to our check out, when we were offered coffee and a bag of treats to bring with us, everything was carefully thought out and seamless. The hotel even gave us some really surprising gifts when they learned that we were celebrating my finishing cancer treatment for the trip. We enjoyed the food at the lounge every evening; it was simply such a classy place to relax after a day. This place was a bit of a splurge for our price range but was definitely worth every cent! "
March 2017,A Definite 5 Star!,"Everything about Hotel 41 was perfection! My husband and I felt like royalty from start to finish. The staff and service were impeccable! The atmosphere was warm and friendly. Each day began with a lovely breakfast and helpful suggestions for making the most of our outings. The staff was extremely knowledgeable. Each evening we returned to our room to find the fire going, candlelight and rose petals!  We wanted to pack up the hotel and staff and transport them to Paris for the next leg of our journey. Hotel 41 is our new favorite place. We are forever spoiled and cannot wait to return!"
February 2017,Impeccable service!,"The hotel is small in size, but the service is second to none. From the moment we arrived at the hotel until our bags were loaded into the taxi after checkout, every staff member went the extra mile to make our stay feel special. The attention to detail that is provided by this hotel was spectacular. I am certain that, next time in London, this is the first hotel I will book for my stay. Besides the service, the hotel is centrally located and accessible to may attractions."
June 2016,Great Experience,We stayed there for 3 nights. My family thought the place was the best. We loved the family atmosphere and the view from the top floor was amazing. The food was also great. We particularly liked the pizza served in the main restaurant.
March 2017,Simply the Best!,Everything from check in to checkout was amazing. Malcolm and his team (especially Andrew and Lauren) made sure that i felt like family and never wanted for anything... a rose on international women's day was a nice touch :) Bottom line is that if you want to be spoiled... stay here!
February 2017,Work trip with a tourist weekend in between,"This property lives up to the hype.  My first impression of the service was excellent.  I flew into London early on a Friday morning.  I had a work meeting and was able to drop my bags at the hotel, use a room to freshen up and change and then proceed to my meeting.  My room and luggage was all set when I returned in the late afternoon.  The service here sets the place apart.  I met my college age son in London for a Chelsea match over the weekend.  The staff put Chelsea jerseys in our room for fun.  Very nice touch!  All of the staff are attentive without being meddling.  The executive lounge is lovely and comfortable.  The rooms and bath facilities are excellent.  I will definitely visit again."
April 2016,Lives up to the hype in every way.,"I've been lucky enough to stay at some amazing hotels in amazing cities all over the world. Offhand, I can't think of any experience that matches a stay at Hotel 41. The level of service is truly impeccable. The rooms are gorgeous. I spent two nights in a two-floor suite, which was deeply luxurious. Looking forward to my next opportunity to stay."
March 2017,Special afternoon tea,"A huge thank you to Flo, Andrew and Lauren for arranging, and allowing me, to bring my friend Diane to celebrate her special birthday. She felt right at home and loved every minute. 41 is unique and goes out its way to accommodate you and fulfil your wishes. My second home!"
March 2017,Superlative,"My wife and I stayed for two nights for her 40th birthday surprise weekend trip away.On arrival we made very welcome and received a complimentary glass of champagne,we were informed about the complimentary treats that are served in the Executive lounge all day long.To make the stay even more spectacular we were upgraded to the Conservatory Suite(pure luxury),if the hotel can make your stay even more remarkable they will endeavour too.Complimentary champagne served for breakfast on the day of my wife's birthday,a birthday cake at night in the room,top restaurant and spa treatment booked by the hotel,it all add's up.Its the small things from getting direction's,seeking advice on excursion's and talking in general they do well.The breakfast's were superb with a wide variety to…"
April 2017,Awesome Place to Stay,"I have stayed at the 41 several times and it never fails to amaze me on how great the staff and the hotel are here.  The hotel is 5 star all the way from the moment you enter the building till when you leave you are treated like family.  Need something no worries just pick up the phone and hit the ""What ever/Where ever"" button and they are on the case.  Hungry or need something to drink late at night no problem they have that covered with all sorts of treats and drinks in the Lounge or just raid the awesome room mini bar.  Need that special room for that special night book the Conservatory Suite and have a night under the stars inside"
February 2017,Luxury private club atmosphere at a fair price,"This is a really interesting place. I stayed over with someone who was a hotel guest and was pleasantly surprised by this understatedly opulent place.  The hotel lobby is rather deceptive because it just seems like a narrow entryway tucked between a restaurant entrance and the entrance to another hotel next door, The Rubens, which is a sister property to Hotel 41 - they are both part of the Red Carnation chain of hotels. Once upstairs, however, you get the full experience of lush, chintzy luxury with a lot of restraint thrown in - everything's really pricey looking but not in a way that's ostentatious. There's just enough of a whiff of excess to make it all seem like you're in a really great property.  The room we were in was a bi-level suite - the ground floor had a little…"
November 2016,Superb! ,"I'm a little late reviewing the superb Hotel 41 it has to be the best hotel I've ever stayed in, the staff were absolutely wonderful and the ambience of this wonderful home from home was just what my husband and I needed for a short Xmas shopping break. This hotel deserves all the awards and accolades it receives I can't wait for my next visit. "
April 2017,An amazing weekend away!,"We wanted to escape to London for a romantic weekend away, to catch a show, see some sights and stay somewhere that felt 'special'...  Hotel 41 is 'special'!  Throughout our stay the service was exceptional, the entire team being friendly, warm and always willing to go that extra mile for us.  I had arranged for a few additional surprises for my partner and Hotel 41 didn't disappoint and in fact exceeded my expectations.  We would particularly like to thank Andrew for his great service and personal touch during our stay - you're a credit to the industry and the hotel.   Our room was excellent with all the amenities you would expect and more from robes in the bathroom to sound proof glazing and one of the most comfortable beds I have ever had the pleasure to sleep in. (I would…"
November 2016,Believe the hype ,"Thought other reviewers may have exaggerated, but no it really is that great. Had an amazing time from the champagne welcome, to the well stocked ""snack"" bar.  Amazing staff, especially Steve Jones in the lounge and Mitchell for his great dinner recommendations. "
April 2017,simply the best ,"This was my fourth visit to 41 and was greeted by Bastien on entering 41. Once in the lounge Bastien reminded me that whilst here I didn't need to do anything and this statement to me sums up 41. The staff treat everyone with a friendly warm manner and aim to take care of even the smallest detail which was evident when after my daughter said she had sore feet after walking they put a foot spa in our room. Nothing is too much trouble for the team at 41 and will try to help you with anything as I discovered when I asked for pain killers as my daughter had a headache and some one went out on a Sunday morning to get some. Lauren, Magdalena and the rest of the staff make 41 the truly memorable it is. My daughter celebrated her 25 birthday whilst here and after seeing wicked we found…"
April 2017,Service like no other!,"Hotel 41 is a quaint boutique hotel in London on Buckingham Palace road, a very short distance to Victoria and Buckingham Palace.  It's a hidden gem  Service is beyond exceptional and no detail is overlooked.  The Executive Lounge is the perfect place to enjoy breakfast, afternoon tea, pre and post dinner drinks, etc.  While the rooms are modest in size, they have all the charm that you would expect from a luxury resort.  It's a place I highly recommend and already have plans to return to in the fall."
April 2017,Outdone Themselves Again,"I was unsure about writing this review given my preference to keep the hype about this hotel down a notch (and be able to actually book a room without it being full), but they just deserve each and all the rave comments. A wow defines it all.   Yes, I have stayed at The Connaught, at the Mandarin, at the Dorchester, at the Claridges, and the Rosewood; but since we found this jewel, not going back to these other hotels any time soon. They cannot dare challenge the level of detail and excellence that is put by each staff member onto their work. The ""homey"" feel paired with the standards of luxury are, in my opinion, unrivaled.   Being unfair as it is to name some and not all, Mr. Steve Jones is illustrative of the distinctive nature of the place and is the very definition of a…"
March 2017,High level service like no other!,"Our recent stay 41 Hotel was delightful in every way!  From the professional and energetic staff who guided us with dining, theater, directions, and our every whim and need, not a detail was missed.  Service was rendered with the utmost of care and polish. Snacks were abundant, a fireplace in our room was a bonus, and every night a new treat appeared for turn down- rose petals, votives burning, pillow scent spray, chocolate dipped wafers in organza black bags.  I think this place is a real hidden gem."
March 2017,Best Service we have ever experienced ,"Wow is all we can say.  From the moment our cab pulled up we were greeted with big smiles and wonderful attitudes.  Brought up to our beautiful rooms, they accommodated us with a 9am check in, what a treat after getting off an international flight.  Super cozy beds, great showers, and so many freebies. On the first day the staff had already memorized our names, and some how they know as we are headed down the elevator and have your cab waiting, or whatever else you might need.    For my sons birthday they made it so special, gave him sparkling juice in the morning to celebrate, a custom cake left in the room in the afternoon (as he has food allergies), and left him and his brother a gift with a card signed from the whole staff in the evening.  Who does stuff like that?!?   …"
March 2017,W-O-W!,"What an experience!  The hotel is beautiful, and the location is prime - but what really sets Hotel 41 apart is the staff.  Every single person we encountered had as their prime objective to make sure that our needs were met.  From the welcome meeting and glass of champagne on arrival, to the complimentary canapes with our cocktails (and ever-present array of snacks and treats in the Executive Lounge) -- not to mention the candlelight and rose petals that greeted us when we returned to our room late at night -- we were pampered (OK, spoiled) for our entire stay.  I can't imagine staying anywhere else!!"
March 2017,Best Service!,"The Hotel 41 is a unique and wonderful experience. It has a very good service and the hotel it self is in a very well condition. I would defintily cone again and recommend this hotel to friends.  It is very close to the Buckingham Palance, just 8 min ago. Also you can get from there to Hyde Park and easily to Westminster Abby. Restaurants are close by. You have a great selection of complementary food and water. Only the wifi didnt work as easily, but i was out all the time, so didnt need it as much. "
February 2017,Greatest boutique hotel experience in London by far!,My partner and I traveled to London for a few nights and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hotel 41. The property was centrally located near Victoria on Buckingham Palace Road. We were greeted with champagne upon arrival and the staff took the extra effort to get to know us and our plans for our brief stay. We very much enjoyed our English breakfast each morning and canapes in the evening. We were also greeted with a thoughtful congratulatory cake and card in our room to celebrate our recent engagement. We will refer all of our friends to 41 in the future! Many thanks! - Brian Safran
March 2017,Great location... Unparalleled Service.,"The location is fantastic.  We love to walk around London.  Being across the street from the side of Buckingham Palace you are in the center of it all.  The service... well, it beats the location !   The best we have ever enjoy in our many visits to London.  Our room was well furnished, cozy.  The executive lounge a work of art, with exquisite offerings and impecable, friendly service.  A true Gem !"
February 2017,Perfect weekend destination,"Wow, we had read all the reviews and were not disappointed. Hotel 41 is an amazing place to stay, we were thoroughly spoilt from start to finish, all the staff were so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. A fantastic experience that we look forward to repeating in the near future."
March 2017,By Far the Best Boutique Experience in the World!,"If you are looking for out of this world personalized service, it does not get better than this.  My husband and I travel all over the world for work and pleasure.  We decided on Hotel 41 for a personal trip to London over Spring Break after reading excellent Trip Advisor reviews.  The reviews don't even come close to how magnificent this place is.  Before we arrived in London, the hotel sent us a special list of ""wish"" items to fill out so that they could properly prepare our room for our arrival.  No detail is too small.  We alerted them that our 11 year old daughter was coming with us on the trip.  When we arrived, every member of the staff knew our name and greeted our daughter like a true VIP.  We had champagne waiting and ice cream for our daughter.  They made up a special…"
March 2017,Second stay... there will be a 3rd hopefully,"Outstanding location... outstanding room, outstanding linen, outstanding staff, outstanding food, outstanding General Manager... Malcolm Hendry. close to Victoria Station and Buckingham Palace... easy to go for a run in the nearby Green or Hyde Park... there is a reason why this hotel has been voted the best. "
March 2017,Service did not disappoint!,Exactly what I was expected on its take of luxury and service when I took my wife there for her birthday. I recommend spending time there for an afternoon tea. In addition the reception service was always accommodating when we called them.
December 2016,Out of this world,"I'm getting married on the 11th of March and only realised today that I hadn't put up my review for the place I proposed.  My soon to be wife and I stayed at Hotel 41 in December 2015.  It was the perfect proposal location.  The staff were amazing from start to finish.  Always welcoming and polite, nothing was too much to ask.  Our suite was without a doubt the best hotel room I've ever stayed in.  Amazing quality furnishings, technology and accessories.  After some champagne to get my courage up and then more to celebrate we made the most of the Raid the Pantry enjoying the fantastic range of snacks and treats.  The following morning we were greeted and congratulated by more staff before enjoying a delicious breakfast.  When the wedding is done and the honeymoon enjoyed we will…"
February 2017,Exceptional on every level - Just the best experience ever.,"We booked an overnight stay here to celebrate my Birthday, we also booked the Afternoon Tea and the Romantic Turndown Package, I cannot stress enough how perfect everything was at this beautiful romantic hideaway in the heart of the City. The levels of service and attention to detail were second to none.  We had Champagne on arrival, we had been upgraded as a special treat for my Birthday into a stunning two storey suite.  We were greeted with fresh fruit and a Birthday Cake together with a bottle of Champagne and chocolates which had been arranged by our Daughter as a surprise.  Everything was just perfect.  Our Afternoon Tea was exquisite, everything was so fresh and perfectly arranged. The scones were warm and the orange ones were a work of genius. The cake selection was…"
December 2016,Lovely,This hotel was just fantastic! I've never been to a more beautiful place to stay! Everything is so quaint and the staff is just overwhelmingly friendly! Don't make it to London often but when I do you can bet I'll stay here!
January 2017,Hard to beat...,"Superb boutique hotel. Great location. Super-attentive staff. Comfortable and true luxury accommodations. Personalized service. Superb 24/7 ""private library"" for snacks, tea, drinks, relaxing. More appropriate for adults, i.e., not necessarily kids-friendly. Not glitzy, but you will feel at home in the heart of one of the world's great cities. Can't recommend more highly."
November 2016,My genius loci. It was a dream.,"restored with an amazing taste, a black and white suite , a cosiness that only in such genius loci hotels in London you can find. This place is a Life experience. You should try it at least once in a lifetime . And enjoy"
February 2017,Out of this world ,We this was our third visit to hotel 41 and I can honestly say this place gets better every stay. We had an upgrade to an executive suite. All the staff were amazing. We couldn't fault anything. I had the best surprise of my life when my partner proposed to me at the ritz. He had arranged everything himself with the help of the staff at the hotel. We then had a congratulations cake and champagne breakfast it was truly amazing. We had little gifts in our room each nite when we had a turndown and special thanks to Dominic and andrew. We were lucky enough to meet Malcolm the manager just to say what a great hotel he has and thanks for all his help. The staff go the extra mile and have always got time to speak to you and assist you in any way.  Looking forward to our next visit 
February 2017,Birthday trip,"We stayed at Hotel 41 in the King Executive Suite through Costco Travel for five nights.  I have to say we were pampered.  The room was very clean and very well appointed. The staff left fruit and treats everyday in the room. We had a king size bed and a down duvet.  We used the pillow menu to order a body pillow and other pillows.  We slept very well.  Our room had a Nespresso maker and a tea kettle.  The hotel breakfasts were delicious and we also tried the full tea, which was also very tasty.  All the staff were wonderful and very accommodating.  They took care of our dinner reservations, cabs, shows, etc..  Hotel 41 is right across the street from Buckingham Palace.  Just a five minute walk to the Changing of the Guards.  The Hotel is about a ten minute walk to West Minster…"
February 2017,3rd visit.... still surprising us!,"Stayed here recently with my partner for 3 nights. I was planning to propose at the ritz and Adele  helped me organise a romantic turndown after we got in from the ritz. The next morning we had a champaign breakfast and a nice celebration cake was presented to us! The hotel is perfect in every way. We had a room upgrade that was perfect.. turndown every night with a little gift left on your pillow. Fresh fruit in the room daily. The lounge area is perfect to relax and have a drink.. they make a great cocktail!  The snacks are perfect throughout the day! The breakfasts here are out of this world! Perfect! We even got to catch up with Andrew on our last day, we saw him on our previous 2 stays and he's always got time for a chat with the guests.  I cannot wait to return for our 4th…"
January 2017,would definitely visit again,"The Hotel 41 not only lives up to it's five star rating, but in our opinion exceeded that! The staff was warm, cordial, and exceedingly helpful. The staff treated us like family. The restaurant was elegant and the food was exceptional. Our room had many amenities, was fastidious, and nicely decorated. This is a hotel we would definitely visit again."
May 2016,Hotel 41,"This is without doubt a superb hotel the very best.Took my wife here  for our anniversary, staff couldn't have been more attentive room was brilliant will be booking again soon.lovely and central Buckingham palace over the road Chelsea not far away well within walking distance. Oxford street short walk shops are something else.Stunning."
January 2017,Incredible hotel stay!,"My daughter and I returned from a trip to Paris and London this past week and the Hotel 41 in London was an incredible highlight.  It would be difficult to overstate the elegance, service, friendliness, extra touches... that the staff put into our experience.  We stayed 4 nights and after day-long excursions each day we found delight in returning to the lounge/library area every evening for a drink and snacks.  The staff were welcoming, knew us by name immediately and took great care of us.  The room was lovely and the turn-down service each evening was beautiful, with small treats and notes for the following day.  On our last evening we went to the Harry Potter play , which they knew about, and they celebrated our magical outing with a plate of 2 cupcakes commemorating the…"
May 2016,Ok hotel with very smal rooms,"We stayed here for 3 nights and the location is great, The hotel is nice but the rooms where way to smal for the price!!! The staff was not that great! Would maybe come back if the price was very low..."
February 2017,Best service,"Hotel 41 was our first stop after our flight from Australia.   Arriving early in the morning after a day flying we were delighted to enjoy a cooked breakfast and then we were shown to our lovely room.   We were continually impressed with all the personalised touches throughout our 2 day stay and thoroughly enjoyed everything about the hotel.  The bed was divine, the decor, beautiful bath and robes all helped make our stay enjoyable.  The service from all staff from the front door to reception and wait staff were all 5 star.  The breakfasts, drinks and snacks available were all delicious.  The location was also very convenient with plenty to do and see in walking distance. We will definitely stay again.  We can confirm that the fabulous reviews are well deserved. "
February 2017,Top weekend,My wife and I spent the weekend here. Outstanding location and even better staff and food. Nothing was any trouble and all the staff was friendly towards us. Even got a member of staff to come on a run with me. Couldn't of ask for more. 
February 2017,Extraordinary,"Our annual business trip to London turned into to an exceptionally comfortable, low-key and ""warm"" experience thanks to the extraordinary staff and five-star-service every member provided at Hotel 41.   First and foremost, the hotel couldn't be located at a better location for travel as it's located a few quick minutes from Victoria Station. In terms of walking, restaurants and landmarks abound - all within a few quick minutes distance.  We booked a split level suite for our trip and the designed served several purposes. First, we had a separate space downstairs with a cozy couch, warm fireplace and small table - which was replenished daily with a bowl of delicious fresh fruit.  The second level was a spacious bedroom with lovely windows, a large and comfortable bed, and extra…"
November 2016,It's Everything They Say,"My husband and I stayed a few nights at Hotel 41 in early November to celebrate our anniversary.  Given the reviews, hotel website and price, we were expecting nothing less than excellence - and that is what we received.  I think what impressed us the most was how comfortable the hotel and experience was.  There is a thing as being doted on too much and the staff at Hotel 41 know exactly the right balance.  Each night we sat by the fire for at least an hour to wind down, have a drink and think about the day that we had and what was on tap for the next day.  The staff came by to chat a bit but also gave us space to enjoy our evening.  I also think that this hotel, while very expensive, is a good value.  The stay includes the ""plunder the pantry"" and snacks to take on your daily…"
February 2017,Incredible value highly recommended ,"We stay for two day only but we're sure next time we will come back to stay here, room so comfortable with all of facilities you gonna need... Nothing bad to say. Staff very kind on reception they try to speak even in our language.. Was and amazing time hopefully we could come back soon. "
February 2017,2 night anniversary break,"What can i say this hotel is nothing short of perfect, myself and my husband had a 2 night stay to celebrate our wedding anniversary and from the moment we arrived we loved the place. Every member of staff was so friendly which to us made the stay even better. The room was lovely,and the little extras are a delightful surprise. The executive loung where we had breakfast each morning is so relaxing and the breakfast and evening meal we had here was the best I have had in a while. Will definitely be returning."
February 2017,Beyond Excellent ,"I booked this hotel for my mother's birthday as I saw a newspaper article on it a while back. She loves luxury hotels and it can be difficult to impress her, but she told me that it was the best hotel she has ever stayed in.   I booked the king room and it was really nice and spacious and even had a fire place, they left a little birthday cake for her too (it was very tasty) all of the staff are really knowledgable and friendly. My mother loved it so much she wants to go again, maybe I'll book it for her next birthday too. I'll probably get my dad to go with her instead of me as it is a nice hotel for couples.   Thank you for our stay, my mum loved and she wishes TripAdvisor had more than 5 stars. 'Beyond excellent' in her words thanks again. "
February 2017,Simply outstanding.,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for my birthday treat, and a treat it was. The actual hotel is located on the 5th floor of Rubens at the palace. It's a beautiful building with a striking 350 square meter living side wall. As soon as we entered the hotel the  level of service was outstanding. As we sat down at the grand check in desk, in the beautiful executive lounge, it was explained that it is tradition to have a glass of champagne and the only difficult decision was pink or white! After checking in we decided to finish our drink in front of the roaring fire and admired the amazing room. The complimentary snacks on offer are exceptional, sweets, popcorn, chocolate, olives etc and a fridge full of ice cream. Our room was lovely, we opted for an executive king. We had a…"
February 2017,Top notch boutique hotel,"Just stayed for 6 nights. This hotel is all about service. They pamper you from the minute you arrive. I can not say enough about the level of service. I did not want to leave. The staff is great but I must give extra compliments to Adele. A couple of negatives- room 4107 shares a wall with the housekeeping closet. There were loud banging noises at times. This can be somewhat annoying when you want to relax after a long trip or day of sightseeing. It seemed to happen first thing in the morning and throughout the day. With that being said it would absolutely not deter me from coming back. And if you are accustomed to a ""rainshower"" type shower then I would suggest requesting that up front. Our first room had a shower nozzle that was hand held. Not what I'm used to and may not be…"
January 2017,Great location,Its in a good location hotel yeah deffo u can find more cheap hotels around but that one is good we realy enjoyed our stay its a big and very confortable hotel. Theres good staff working here we will be back x
January 2017,Most Romantic Anniversary,"We chose to come back from New Year's in Paris to stay in Hotel 41 for our 20th Anniversary and couldn't be happier.  They consistently outdo themselves with every stay.  We were greeted in our upgraded room with an anniversary cake.  That evening, they lit the fireplace and scattered rose petals and lit candles in our room for turndown.  I should also mention that for our dinner, they got us an 8pm reservation in the most romantic room of a restaurant that some wait months to get (and they did it one week before our trip).  I can't rave about this place enough - we refuse to even consider any other hotel in London."
December 2016,Best Hotel ever,Amazing . Could not fault them at all.Hotel was lovely and presented beautifully. Staff were attentive and went out of their way to make you comfortable and really took care of you. Would definitely return for anther stay.
December 2016,Beautiful hotel,"I stayed at this hotel for the 1st time. It's a good solid spot. The rooms are elegant but they have everything you need.  The area is great lots of street art, bars and restaurants, 5 min walk to the subway. The staff are friendly. Stayed December 2016"
December 2016,Absolutely amazing in every way,"This hotel is simply the best!  Its location is incredible, the hotel is beautiful, and the staff is on par with some of the best hotels in the world!    We stayed over New Year's Eve for four nights, and everything was perfect - The check-in process was fast and pleasant (which was appreciated as we had just gotten off a 11 hour red eye flight from Colorado).  The room was immaculate and ready early - all of our special requests were granted, and the concierge was even able to find us premium theater tickets on short notice.  Within an hour of arrial, we were already beyond pleased.  I could go on for paragraphs - the food/snacks in the lounge were amazing, the bar was incredible, the wines were tasty.  Every one of the staff members was fantastic (special kudos to Stephen, who…"
December 2016,New Years Stay,"This was our second stay at this property. We stayed for two nights in a regular room and then three nights in a Junior Suite. What actually sets this hotel apart really isn't the physical rooms, as admittedly they are quirky (and in the case of the regular room, very small) and unique. It is the level of service that is provided here, which is pretty unmatched to any other hotel we have stayed in all over the world.   Case in point, they gave us a free bottle of champagne when we checked in to the regular room, but we did not consume it for a few days. The entire time they replaced the ice in the bucket until we actually opened it on the third day we were there. Also, we are a same-sex couple and when they left slipper bags by our bed, on each side it said ""his"" as opposed to…"
December 2016,Hotel 41 has given me a terrible problem!,"There. That was an attention seeking title, and I'll bet you'll wonder at the 5star rating?  This hotel does service so very well that there are few places that come close, and as a result this means that a search for hotels in other cities can be a trial.   Our most recent visit to 41 was for a weekend in the run-up to Christmas and,boy, did we 'do' London Christmas. 41 provided a calm and serene oasis away from the madness of the capital whilst being attentive enough to meet all our needs.   I am continually impressed by the staff and the lack of staff turnover and how we are greeted by name as returning guests. There are lessons in customer service right there. What they do is not difficult or unique but it is hard to find any other place doing it consistently and therein…"
January 2017,Lovely hotel,"My self and my wife visited hotel 41 for our anniversary the welcome was amazing the staff were so helpful and the hotel was small but very very intimate perfect for us.   We were upgraded which was very nice and a complimentary bottle of champagne was in our room lovely touch, I would have been happy to give 5 stars but the bar service was not up to scratch our cocktails were not well made and on 2 occasions they didn't have basic ingredients for our drinks, this could have been because we stayed just after the New Year which was a bank holiday and maybe they had run out without a chance to replenish.  Great hotel lovely food great staff thanks to everyone."
December 2016,Believe all the accolades about Hotel 41!,"My husband and I, along with our teenage daughters, have stayed at Hotel 41 three times, and each time is a wonderful revelation.  The rooms are lovely, the staff is gracious and helpful, and the hotel is quiet.  We enjoyed delicious complimentary snacks and appetizers in the lounge before seeing a show--the lounge is a wonderful pre-evening or post-evening place to relax.  The staff each time has ensured that our stay in London was outstanding.  If you think the quality of your hotel experience cannot substantially enhance your vacation enjoyment, you have not been to the Hotel 41."
December 2016,"Great Location, Impeccable staff, Incredible service, Superb treats.","Previous to staying here I could not believe the “Excellent Reviews” on tripadvisor for Hotel 41 could be accurate / truthful. WELL THEY ARE ! !  We’re from Lincolnshire,,, We’re cynical,,, We’re sceptical,,, We’re wary,,, We’ve been disillusioned too many times. If we had not witnessed the excellent service, the pristine cleanliness, the friendliness of ALL the staff, the superb decor, the wonderful facilities with numerous delightful  touches for ourselves we would have never believed such a place could exist. I’ve said for long enough there is a need for somewhere like this, well here it is ! ! Even though Hotel 41 is the number 1 hotel for the whole of London on tripadvisor we never encountered one member of staff or other guest who was snooty, intimidating, plain obnoxious…"
October 2016,"I Have Been Ruined By Hotel 41!!  (part 1, for part 2 please see Ashford Castle, Cong Ireland)","For the rest of our lives my husband and I will say 'it's no Hotel 41' every time we visit a hotel/inn. Every other place (except the Ashford Castle, Cong Ireland) now seems ill kept and lacking a personal touch.  While I would theoretically love to visit other properties in London, I don't believe we will ever be able to pass up an opportunity to stay at the 41.  We stayed for 5 nights and I could give many examples of why it is special.  One example is our friends checked in and were asked which newspaper they preferred to receive.  Our friend said 'anything with a crossword puzzle'.  The next morning there was a crossword puzzle book tucked into her paper. So thoughtful! During our stay we saw three regular King rooms and all were different but charming. The 'plunder the…"
December 2016,Absolutely excellent place!,"This hotel is a hidden gem.  It is a small hotel located on a main street.  From the minute you walk in you are greeted with a hot chocolate and lots of little treats; sweets, nuts, dried fruit.  In the main lobby there is a buffet cart which is constantly being refilled with a range of snacks from sweets to cold meats to curries.  You could literally stay in the hotel all day and enjoy the range of snacks and treats.  There is also a lovely fireplace which makes sitting in the lounge that bit more special.   The staff are incredible too, nothing is too much trouble.  They are always there to answer any questions or make suggestions.  The rooms are well presented and the bed is very comfortable.   It is an excellent hotel and worth a visit.  It may be a little pricey but all the…"
May 2016,Perfect and Terrific,"If you wanna experience one of the best and terrific London luxury experience you definitely need to go at Hotel 41. Everything is perfect since the first moments and steps you move onto the premises. Excellent service, excellent staff and simply excellent venue right in the middle of the Royal London. You can never be disappointed when booking a stay here. Definitely worth the visit. Priceless."
December 2016,The Best,"Florent and his team have to be the best. The warmest welcome and genuine too; nothing is too much trouble. We choose not to stay anywhere else in London now. We love the attention to detail eg the hot water bottle put in bed for us and fresh fruit in our room. We love ""raid the pantry"" after an evening at the theatre. Why other hotels don't do it is beyond me. The location is perfect. We can't wait for our next visit."
December 2016,There is a reason why we keep coming back! Incredible Hotel!,"This was our third stay at Hotel41.  My thoughts and words that I've written in my previous reviews haven't changed a bit.   It's still simply outstanding!  Without repeating much of what I've written in my two previous reviews it's safe to say that my expectations were once again met and well and truly exceeded. It's just such a unique & exciting experience when staying at this Hotel as you become a friend as opposed to another 'number'. The single level devoted to this Hotel keeps everything nice and simple. The guest focused service though I've rarely experienced at other Hotels of this level.  Flo, Magdalena & Steve Jones all deserve a huge thank you for making our stay yet again one to remember! A truly amazing experience.    You cannot be dissapointed with the level or…"
December 2016,Faultless ,"Intimate without ever being intrusive - a very very special place in the heart of London.   Rooms are immaculate with an exceptional attention to detail that I've only seen at the sister hotel (The Milestone) at this price point. The Library Bar (executive lounge) is a superb place to unwind. However, what really sets 41 apart is the team - absolutely faultless and as a result priceless. The nicest, most genuine and caring people you'll meet - Andrew, Florent, Adele, Lauren and the rest of the team are exceptional people. Beatrice Tollman and family have curated an amazing place and group of people. "
January 2017,My First Stay  at 41.  Excellent!,"Having stayed in sister-hotel-next-door The Rubens a couple of times, 41 beckoned as an interesting and special alternative.  I had been spending the festive season with friends and family in Sussex, on leave from my life abroad.  My last night in UK was to be spent celebrating my sister's birthday in London prior to flying out of Heathrow.   I checked in and had a light lunch by the fire in 41's comfortable and welcoming Executive Lounge, together with the very nice offer of a glass of complimentary champagne .  Resting up for the afternoon in a stylish and carefully designed 5 star room, I found everything to be in good working order, all sparkling and clean.   I returned to the Lounge for a pre-party aperitif with superb canapes and croque monsieur.  I chatted to the…"
August 2016,Classic Style I'd say...would love to return❤️,"Our first visit to London.  Trip Advisor reviews steered us to Hotel 41 to mark our 40th Anniversary.  Was very special indeed.  Our room had a view of the Buckingham Palace Mews (stables).  Small but suitable and a great bath. The ""reception"" area was lovely any time of day..including 3 am when turning your time around.  The young man offered me a pot of tea and we shared conversation.  Upon arrival you are treated to bubbly, but subsequent beverages are on you.  We enjoyed,the breakfast and snacks.  Location is great for seeing the Palace, parks and nice restaurants in Victoria.  For our budget this is a special hotel stay but you desire a nice boutique feel with service....please stay."
November 2016,Most friendly comfortable and luxurious ,"Hotel 41 is our second home in London. We could not ask for more accommodating staff, great location , great atmosphere , comfortable rooms. Perfect. We come back again and again. Breakfast is delicious. If it's not on the menu, they will make it for you. Lots of good restaurant in the area. The staff is excellent in booking restaurant ms for you. "
December 2016,Stunning Hotel & Outstanding Service,"This really is a great hotel very near Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station (District/Circle underground line). The staff are exceptional and cannot do enough to help you regardless of what you need. The rooms are small, but really well decorated and have everything you would expect. The main reception/dinning room is excellent and is a great place to start any evening having a few drinks before heading out. Location wise its great for getting around London and seeing the sites."
December 2016,Royal treatment by psychic staff and Plunder-the-Pantry!,"My wife and I have stayed in many hotels all over the world and, when in London, usually stay at boutique hotels in Mayfair. We had learned of Hotel 41 when staying at a sister hotel, The Chesterfield, where they recommended that we visit Hotel 41 in anticipation of a future visit to London.  Some have been more lavish; however, this is a hotel where the staff carry the day.  The staff-to-guest ratio is probably the highest I have experienced and they seem able to anticipate every need, even communicating guest particulars (eg, activities, questions, preferences) among themselves.  The multinational (and multilingual) staff seemed genuine in their friendliness and sincere in their welcome.  While the hotel is in a fairly busy area, across the street from the Royal Mews, and a…"
March 2017,London,Awesomeness filled experience dont think a stay can be more delightfull best hospitality best food..😘😘 what to say people serve you with sooooooo much love felt like home especially the stafff is sooo kind nd hardworking..
March 2017,Excellent,I liked this hotel very much! The waiters are cute and nice when you ask for fresh water. Rooms are excellent. I will definitely recommend it to my parents and to my children. Also it is close to the metro station.
February 2017,"Still, Simply the Best","After several years of traveling into London on business, my wife and I continue to appreciate the absolutely amazing personal service we receive at 41. Mr. Hendry, Lauren, Magdalena, and Marlen all raise your experience to levels not experienced anywhere else.  Returning to the hotel each day feels like returning home where Steve is waiting with a welcoming smile and your favorite libation.  The property is small, which allows staff to get to know each guest and provide bespoke care. Each room is unique, and I would suggest you communicate any requirements you might have. The quietness,  attentive service, and luxury are the reason this hotel continues draw us back.  The experience here is unique, and Mrs. Tollman deserves accolades for her new directions in hotel experiences. …"
March 2017,Absolutely stunning,Stayed here for 4 days in London and i was absolutely amazed by how stunning this place is. It was perfectly clean and felt like staying in a palace. Staff were also amazing. Would definitely recommend and would love to stay here again. 
February 2017,Out of this world,"Just back from a Wonderful 3 night stay.  The staff are so Professional and treat everyone with Respect and Care. All the food from Breakfast, to Snacks, to ""Plunder the Pantry"" are Delicious. Our room had everything we wanted and more. I felt we were treated like the only guests in the hotel. Fab..Fab...Fab"
February 2017,A little bit of Heaven on Earth,"Just returned from our first visit to the hotel and it was an amazing stay, celebrating my wife's birthday. The special touches made the occasion all the more memorable. It certainly lives up to its reputation. Cannot wait to go back. The Plunder the Pantry is one of the highlights. The service is superb and you are treated as a special guest from the moment you enter the hotel. It is obvious why it has earned all its awards including the recent Forbes 5 Star. The hotel and all the staff deserve such recognition."
February 2017,The most amazing experience,"We booked in to this hotel for my wife's birthday with our miniature daschund and we had the most amazing time. We have stayed in hotels across the world and the service in this hotel is the best we have experienced and they could not do enough for us, the dog (!) or our children who came to visit us as they are at London University / Working. If you are thinking about booking dont hesitate because you will not be disappointed."
February 2017,25th Wedding Anniversary,I took my wife and Mother and Father in Law to this Hotel.  There is nothing I can say except this is the best hotel I have evert stated in. The staff were the most polite and graceful people I have ever met. Steve Jones and Michelle to name 2 could not do enough for us. I cannot give more than 5 stars but I would say it needs 10 ⛤
February 2017,Amazing,"We booked Hotel 41 after reading the amazing reviews on here. Our stay exceeded our expectations beyond belief. For us this trip had been planned for a while and definitely worth the wait. From the moment we stepped through the front door we were treated like we were the only people in the hotel and nothing was a problem. We did not see our cases again until we reached our room, we were offered a choice of different champagne and selection of canapés on checking in. Our room was amazing and the turn down service is very special. We will definitely be returning to this special hotel and will highly recommend hotel 41 to anyone."
February 2017,Incredible service!,"From the time we arrived we were treated like royalty by the staff of Hotel 41. This is a small boutique hotel and the service provided by Patrycja, Andrew, Dominic, Maria and Adele was tremendous. We were pampered from the moment we arrived. We had a small problem with the toilet and for the inconvenience, we were offered breakfast for the week for my wife and I. They arranged great seats for both The Book of Mormon and Wicked on the day of the shows. Every restaurant suggestion was custom tailored to our needs. They sent us a bottle of Vuevre Champagne to our room, just because. After I stopped to thank them for the outstanding week in London, they arranged a transport to the airport free of charge in a Mercedes S-class sedan. I can't say enough about the staff and the service…"
July 2016,Simply Outstanding,"The staff at Hotel 41 are always excellent, they are kind, friendly, professional, polite and just can't do enough for you, but they're not overbearing and don't make you feel uncomfortable at all. In fact they all make you feel so welcome it's like having a home from home. The rooms are excellent, very tastefully decorated and well maintained. The Executive Lounge is comfortable and inviting with a warm atmosphere. We went for a special occasion and Lauren and Stefan made it a trip to remember, they were brilliant."
December 2016,"Love this Hotel - Staff Fabulous, Food Fabulous, overall Fabulous",I stayed here with my husband and i can honestly our visit was perfect.  To say the staff were welcoming and professional is an understatement.  The beautiful room was ready when we checked in (at 12 noon!) which was a bonus. We headed out to the shops and on our return we were delighted to see a bottle of wine in our room - just right to start our evening.  We had a drink in the cozy bar when we returned and again the service was amazing.  I didnt want to go home and will definately be back - Thank you to all!
January 2017,Good place to stay ,Hotel 41 is a good modern hotel with all the necessary items in the room. We stayed there for 4 nights and had a awesome experience. Neat and clean city. Must visit if your budget is above 5 lakhs for enjoying and exploring the city.
January 2017,Home from Home - only better,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights last week.  We enjoyed every minute of it.  Room was wonderful with fire burning and even a hot water bottle in the bed in the evening (not seen one of those since my boarding school days). The lounge was wonderful, great snacks and great service.  Breakfast was also good. Staff friendly and seemed genuinely interested in hearing how our day went, if we wanted a taxi etc. etc. Had a guest visiting Friday evening - he was also very impressed.  Enjoyed a gin and tonic in the lounge - so cozy. The location of the hotel is also great.  As we didnt have our lazy children with us we could walk into town - every day - past Buckingham Palace and then either through Green Park or down The Mall.  Perfect. Definately better than home - I dont…"
December 2016,very very nice hotel,We could'.nt say more then people have to say. That the staff was very friendly and very nice with us.  We enjoyed every moment ant the location was important for us.  The bedroom was very clean and comfortable.  Stayed in november. we will be back for sure
December 2016,Consistently superb!,"This was our 5th Christmas at 41, and yet again it was an absolute pleasure.  Florent and Lauren, as always, are exceptional and go out of their way to make us feel like family returning home for the holidays.  Their absolute professionalism, personal touches, sense of fun and genuine care for their guests is what keeps us coming back, again and again!  Every member of the team at 41 is involved with making the whole experience so special.  From those we met in passing while walking through the corridors  to those who served us our breakfast every day and our drinks every night. Everyone we met during our stay showed the same level of care and attention to detail which is what we feel sets 41 apart from other luxury hotels.  It's the little things they do during your stay that…"
January 2017,Amazing Experience ,"Thank you to the staff at Hotel 41!  They could not do enough for us from the smallest tasks to the largest. They made my daughter and I feel at home and welcomed. The executive lounge was lovely and the breakfasts amazing. The rooms could not have been cleaner. The bed was large and comfortable with perfect feather pillows and the down comforters kept us toasty warm. The fire place was definitely put to good use and made the room very cozy and inviting. The staff made a point to ask what we had planned for the day and always followed up (remembering where we went) and asking how we found it. We spent 5 nights at Hotel 41 and could not wait to get back after a long day of sight seeing or a night at the theater. The small lobby that you enter has a staff member there, greeting us…"
December 2016,Absolutely fantastic ambiance!,I enjoyed my stay while in London. The room was everything I had hoped for and I was  completely satisfied with the room service. The staff are friendly and efficient coupled with the luxurious surrounding being top in its league. Highly recommended!
October 2016,Room was beautiful and was great value for money,"Staff were welcoming from when we arrived until we departed and the room was an escape from the world, would recommend this accommodation to all of my friends and  Family 5 * quality A definite must have experience"
January 2017,Very nice!,"We really loved this hotel. Our bed was super comfortable, room was clean and hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. I can recommend this hotel for everyone. You really made our holiday. Thank you!"
January 2017,Just fantastic ,"There's really not much more I can say than others have. This was a treat for my wife's birthday and even though we only stayed one night, we felt like the staff already knew us.   The executive lounge is lovely, the staff are great, and they even upgraded us for free. Nothing is too much trouble.   We will be back! "
January 2017,5* +++,"Best service in a hotel I've experienced. Friendly, efficient, helpful - the list goes on. Faultless. Great room - faultless! Superb location. Welcome reception - superb. Refreshing hot towel & small fruit punch offered. Check out equally as good. Just how a great hotel should be!!"
January 2017,FIRST CLASS - CANNOT RECOMMEND HIGHLY ENOUGH,"My husband and I stayed here on Saturday 21st January, the trip to London to see a show and hotel 41 stay was a Christmas gift from our daughters.  I had seen Hotel 41 reviewed in a newspaper last year as being the Number 1 Hotel in London and I am delighted to have experienced it.  Having stayed in many hotels around the world, this has to be the very top of the list.  We checked in early and were thrilled to be given an ""upgrade"" to a junior suite.  A birthday cake and canapés were awaiting us in the room, what a delightful touch.  The Service and attention to details is an absolute credit to the management and staff.  The hotel has a great ambiance and we can't recommend it highly enough.  We are definitely going to stay here again.  Great work Hotel 41, it was a pleasure and…"
January 2017,Little oasis of calm...with a feel of the ministry of magic!,"From the moment we entered the lobby we were transported into a different world! One where the wellbeing of the customer is a top priority. The staff are so pleasant and friendly without being overbearing or fussy.  The attention to detail is incredible. The room was exquisite and had everything a guest could need (except an emery board...but I'm sure if I had pressed the 'whatever whenever' button one would have magically appeared!) the bed was so comfortable and the room was quiet.  When looking to book this hotel many reviews talk of the free food available...canapés, the pantry, ice-creams and chocolates... but even without all those treats and goodies the place deserves its no.1 status.  The breakfast was excellent too. We even got invited back to the lounge hours after…"
December 2016,best hotel ever,I recently had the pleasure of staying for 2 nights and had a wonderful time. The service was incredible. Easily the best hotel I have ever stayed in and cannot wait to return. Thank you to everyone at 41 for such an amazing experience.
November 2016,A Wonderful Place - Heaven On Earth,"Really good time here, situated well allowing us to spend as much time as we like gawking at Buckingham palace. Would highly recommend a stay here.  The rooms are well kept as was the staff, who were ever so friendly and polite. A lovely place."
January 2017,Long Weekend in London,"Spent two nights at what is quite simply the best hotel I have stayed in anywhere in the world. So what was so special and why will this be our only choice of London hotels in the future. Location - 5 mins walk from Victoria so ideal for all the sights, Selfridges, Harrods etc.  A short walk to Peggy Porschen, Sloane squ and Kings Road.  Welcome - greeted with champagne on arrival. Relaxed in lounge and then escorted to room when ready. Luggage already there ( nice touch).    Room - immaculate. Penhaligons toileteries, Sky channels if you fancied a night in.  Tea lights at turn down and a little circle of rose petals last thing at night. Not forgetting the hot water bottle in bed as well.  Very comfortable bed and pillows and lovely robes for lounging.  Foyer - complimentary hot…"
January 2017,Secret Escape !,"This hotel is a guilty pleasure ! By far the most accommodating hotel you will find so close to Buckingham Palace, The staff go above and beyond to make your stay a memorable experience, nothing is too much trouble, yet it feels so personable almost like a home from home , if you are looking for a secret escape for some R&R with the entertainment that London can iff but a stones throw away this is the one for you."
January 2017,Another great stay at 41,"Just returned from another very enjoyable stay at Hotel 41. We wouldn't think to stay anywhere else in London. Great location, lovely hotel, fantastic staff. Looked after from the moment we arrived, the staff were friendly and professional as always, attending to your every need, providing advice if required. Can't do enough for you.  Super breakfast, breakfast butty and Eggs Benedict this time complimented with a good quality continental buffet. Canapés in the early evening and butler's pantry to satisfy any later hunger.  Look forward to visiting again soon. "
January 2017,Must stay for top luxury experience,"This is a fabulous intimate boutique hotel in a fantastic location, steps from Buckingham Palace and the Victoria tube. Close walking distance to all the posh shops and restaurants as well as the best sites to see.   I can't say enough about the staff and hotel itself. Warm, friendly and they call guests by name as soon as they enter the hotel.  Andrew, the guest experience manager, organized the best restaurants in London for us, and planned every last detail, and room details, including, roses, candles, and an anniversary cake for our anniversary. He's just fantastic!  The room was a king studio decorated perfectly with all the amenities one can imagine. Truly a wonderful experience for those looking for uncompromising quality in the heart of London. I would highly recommend.…"
November 2016,"I could come to London, never leave Hotel 41 and be happy!","My first stay at Hotel 41 was with my husband on our first trip to London. It was such a delightful experience there was no question where I would stay in London on this trip. This trip was with my daughter (14) and a friend. The hotel arranged a suite to accommodate all of us. The service, food, room and atmosphere were all superb. London was lovely and Hotel 41 'made' the trip for us. The staff was helpful and they knew who we were. Such great care was taken of us. Have tea there, such a treat! Thanks for everything.  "
December 2016,Superb service,"Our first Hotel 41 experience was simply wonderful and exceeded what were already very high expectations. It began even before our stay with support and ideas about possible evening entertainment. Our visit began with a warm welcome by the doorman and some hot chocolate and friendly conversation at the ground floor reception, before an effortless, champagne-pampered check-in on the 5th floor and the wonderful surprise of a suite upgrade. We enjoyed a variety of delicious inclusive food and snacks during the day and had a relaxed evening plundering the pantry in front of the fire in the lounge, before a beautiful romantic turndown and a great night's sleep in a surprisingly quiet room. Our stay concluded with the best full english breakfast I've ever had (highlights were the…"
December 2016,Perfection,"Our third time back at Hotel 41 and it was, again, wonderful. From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel so welcome. We were greeted with champagne and although we were very early for check in, the staff still managed to prepare our room, ready for us to settle down straight away. This was our first time staying in a junior suite and it was lovely! We loved the separate living area, the bedroom upstairs and the spacious bathroom. It was sheer perfection.   After fairly busy days in London, it was lovely to come back to the executive lounge and spend our evenings there. We throroughly enjoyed plundering the pantry and sampling the different drinks on offer.   The one thing that made this hotel so special were the staff. They were all so attentive and we liked that they…"
November 2016,Surprise birthday weekend,"We stayed at Hotel 41 last month for one night as a surprise for my husband's birthday. We had a wonderful time - all of the staff are so friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble. I had mentioned when booking why we were coming and we were surprised to find a delicious and beautiful-looking birthday cake waiting in the room when we arrived.   The room itself was comfortable and spacious but the fireplace made it feel very cosy. I had ordered the romantic turndown as a surprise when we got back from dinner which was a lovely extra treat.  All of the food at the hotel was very good - I almost wished I hadn't booked dinner as we were too full to plunder the pantry in the evening! Having told a couple of the staff on arrival that we had tickets the following day to see the…"
December 2016,Speechless... In a good way!,"Amazing stay. Such a quaint place! Customer service and attention to detail could not be faulted at all. My partner proposed to me in the conservatory suite and it couldn't have been more perfect. He had liaised with the hotel staff who he provided a romantic turndown service. We were even brought a ""congratulations"" cake afterwards! Plundering the pantry was awesome and staff were so friendly. I did struggle without a full length mirror in the room, and the pressure of the jacuzzi bath was very variable and fluctuated. Still, I couldn't have asked for a more special place to get engaged. The icing on the cake was the lovely plant that was delivered to our home today from Hotel 41, congratulating us on our engagement. It's thoughtful and personal touches like this that have made…"
December 2016,Short Christmas holiday in London,Our second visit as we just had to return.  Great location to explore central London.  We love the lounge area. Have Steve make you a REAL martini with some great conversation.  This is a very private hotel so very peaceful and elegant.  Not for children in our opinion. When  you finally go to sleep you'll appreciate the wonderful linens and comfortable beds.  great service.   A must try
January 2016,"No better hotel on earth, genuinely!",This Hotel is truly special. The service from the staff is absolutely incredible. They were absolutely amazing from the second we stepped foot in the door to the moment we walked out. You are made to feel like a millionaire and the price of the visit is worth it. Magnificent.
December 2016,Trip ,Amazing trip found this hidden gem the best way by word of mouth. My partner loved it we would definetly return and stay for longer next time. Maybe even a full weekend away with the girls! Great location 
December 2016,Perfection ,"My husband and I stayed at hotel 41 for our 3 year anniversary and we couldn't have asked for a better place to celebrate. Whilst booking they were so helpful allowing us to check in early because we had lunch reservations. Upon arrival they were so friendly and helpful, champagne on check in with nibbles by the fire, so romantic. When we got to our room we had chocolates and a little cake saying 'congratulations' which was so cute. Taxis were all booked for us, they even made sure we had an umbrella because it was raining. The late night buffet was just what we needed after the  Theatre with hot chocolate at the front door too. It was the best place I have ever stayed in. Every customer gets treated like royalty. So caring, generous and helpful. You will not be disappointed…"
December 2016,Superb ,"Thank you hotel 41 for being attentive whilst providing a personal and professional balance of individual needs, all requirements are catered for without being over bearing.  Staff are outstanding, positive and upbeat and enjoy the task of ensuring all guests are comfortable and enjoying your stay with them. My husband had a coughing bout which was noted by a member of staff, Dominic suggested hot water, ginger, honey and lemon to soothe his cough. Which was promptly served to our table, this gesture of utter attentiveness goes towards their guests feeling welcomed and cared for.  One note of criticism, which I have not marked the five star to four as it can improve with a little elbow grease (which I have commented directly to the hotel).  All in all I would suggest if you want…"
December 2016,Almost Overwhelmingly Excellent,"I must confess that 41 represented a bit of an extravagance for us, but my wife and I wanted a special place in London and 41, of course, is at the top of the list, so we called and luckily got a room in this small, elegant, and luxurious hotel. From the start, we were totally impressed by the service. Nicole at reception not only helped us with the booking but also provided travel tips and helped us get situated. Lauren at check-in was friendly and helpful as well, but the highlight was the champagne served during check-in by the most wonderful Steve, master of the opulent lounge area. Our room was smallish but exceptionally well appointed in black and white and 41 all over, a complementary bottle of Roederer Brut Premier awaiting us. The room was spectacular, really, and the…"
February 2016,Luxurious and discreet.,"Our go to hotel in London when we want a quiet stay. The service is flawless from the second you walk in, champagne on entry and free food, drink, ice cream etc for duration of your stay helps make it a memorable one! Its as if the staff are on your shoulder at all times to top your drink up or assist in any request but they manage it without making you feel awkward, almost as if they are invisible until needed! Lounge area is great for a night cap around the fire."
January 2017,Book well in advance. Not a spec of dust,"This hotel is unreal. Everything is posh, clean and clean again. Polished floors, clean windows and friendly staff. Great location, great london prices and definitely a place to unwind by the fire in the big leather chairs with a whiskey and a book. I couldnt fault Hotel 41 "
December 2016,love this place,great rooms and excellent food available throughout the day combined with very helpful staff and extras such as champagne at breakfast and hot water bottles so good we have booked for next year.The executive lounge is a great place to spend a little time and the location of the hotel next to Buckingham Palace is extremely useful
December 2016,Outstanding!,"Stayed for four nights and could not be happier with our choice. Every aspect of the stay was fantastic from the booking through to checkout. To say the service was phenomenal would be an understatement. Each and everyone on the staff at Hotel 41 provided distinctive service with an attention to detail and guest satisfaction. PHENOMENAL is more like it. Highly recommend Hotel 41, especially at the holidays and definitely on New Years Eve!"
December 2016,Excellent,"This hotel is more like a private home with butler service and superb chefs at your service 24/7. Rooms are good and fine but nothing special, apart from comfy beds and all the normal five star attributes, but the thing with 41 is the lobby/library section which really feels like your own living room. I will definitely go back again and again."
December 2016,Love love love!,"Staff was phenomenal! It's not often that you get a hotel with such great service! I was here with my hubby for a week, and I fell in love with it! I will most certainly be back in town to visit! Loved it!"
December 2016,Christmas at Hotel 41,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for  a 3 night stay over Christmas. I can't imagine having more friendly attentive staff throughout the stay who could not have made us feel for more welcome and special throughout our stay.  The rooms and lounge were to a exceptional standard. The food and treats on offer in this lounge are the best I have experienced in executive lounges thought out the uk and overseas. We were more than happy to pay for the drinks in the lounge. The lounge is a real chill out area with lovely snacks and a great chess set. Food at the hotel was amazing, the breakfast hash  browns were to die for and our Christmas Day meal of rib of beef was beautiful. This hotel is a must for anyone wishing to spend a few days in total luxury with such care and attention given from all…"
November 2016,Hotel 41,"A difficult hotel to review without sounding all to gushing.  In the little time I spent at this hotel, unfortunately only a single day and night, has led me to the conclusion that it is without a doubt the single best hotel experience I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.  From the moment we arrived the service is impeccable and it seems that every care has been taken to make your stay as comfortable as poaaible.  The champagne and canapés on arrival and the subsequent food that is lavished upon you at a moment's notice as well as the overall level of service really do leave you with lasting impression of quality and hospitality that is second to nonw.  The rooms from what I saw are finished to a very high standard and toiletries and accoutrements in the room are of a…"
December 2016,Essence of British Luxury and Service,"I cannot say enough about how wonderful the service, food and accommodations were for our pre-Christmas trip to London.  Hotel 41 will be our choice on our next trip unless someone can irrefutably prove to us that there is something better in London - a feat not likely to occur.  Service is simply perfect.  Attention to every detail but without undue imposition. Cleanliness was impeccable - seldom seen at any hotel at any price. Value for the over-the-top experience was frankly a bargain.  This is a 29 room boutique carved out of the larger Rubens Hotel in the same building but this little gem has its own private entrance and elevator that only goes to the 5th floor where this is located.  One common room impressively comfortable for meals and drinks and conversation.  Some…"
October 2016,FAULTLESS!!!!!,"The attention to detail in this property is amazing.  Trust the pictures that you see, it is absolutely amazing here.  The staff, accommodation, everything is completely and utterly brilliant and it can't be praised enough.   Highly recommended. All the staff were exemplary..."
November 2016,Amazing ,Absolutely amazing hotel and staff. Couldnt ask for anything more. Even though a lot of redevelopment in the area we didnt hear any noise once!  To summarise would stay again everytime Im in London. Perfect.
January 2016,WoW!,Wow factor is guaranteed! Unique and luxurious! It was not only comfortable but a whole adventure. Staff was highly qualified and helpful in every occasion. Location is fantastic. Feels like you're in Buckingham Palace. Wish you great experience ;)
September 2016,I LOVE IT !!!!!,"Are you special? Then stay at the 41! We went to London for a short 2 nights trip. I choose the 41 because of the TripAdvisor reviews and all of them are true. The 41 is out of this world, its just amazing. The location, the staff, the food and its got an help yourself bar. Yes, a bar where you can mix your own drinks. That's just amazing. I loved it. It reminded me on my student times when i was a part time Bartender. My wife still talks about the 41 and our stay there. For sure, when we are back in London, we stay at the 41 again."
December 2016,Perfect stay,We treated ourselves to a nights stay at a weekend having found this hotel on TripAdvisor. Right from the start we knew we were in for a treat. The girl at the initial front door reception was friendly/ very chatty but in a polite way. At the main reception on the 5th floor we got checked in and had a glass of champagne. Our room was a split level junior suite which was superb. The lounge had great snacks. It is well situated and we walked up to a Covent Garden. Breakfast was excellent. Staff always at hand and very attentive. Really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend. 
October 2016,unique!,What a fantastic place in a beautiful city! I really loved the staff here as they knew how to treat us! We will definitely return here in the future!! The location was amazing and everything else was so easy to get to!
November 2016,Luxury break,"Well worth pushing the boat out for this Hotel. Customer service is excellent, a nice glass of champagne in the lounge on arrival, and few little extra touches along the way. As other people have said, its a fairly intimate, not like other Hotels, you are greeted as you walk in and then walk along the corridor to the lift at the end. This will take you up to the 5th floor where the rooms and lounge are situated.  Our room was fantastic and the best bed we have slept in. The bathroom had a walk in shower along with a second shower in the bath, so we could both get ready at the same time. The turn down service was also special as they left a hot water in the bed for us, and nice tea lights with rose petals scattered around.  Don't hesitate to book this Hotel."
May 2016,The best hotel I've ever been to,"I stayed at 41 Hotel London for 5 days to attend a conference held in Brighton. The hotel was conveniently located to use the trains from London Victoria station. During the stay, everything was perfect. I didn't feel like going out due to the comfort of the hotel. Although my English was not fluent, every staff was so kind and friendly that they always made effort to listen my poor English. Thanks to them, I really enjoyed my second trip to London.  Especially I'd like to appreciate Cyprian (sorry if I mistake the spelling...) for his kindness also to my pregnant wife who wasn't there at that time. I'm sure I'll be back to 41 Hotel in the near future with my family."
December 2016,A perfect special experience,"As a family we stay in London regularly for weekends, so when it came to organising a weekend to celebrate our 25th anniversary, somewhere to stay as a couple, my wife and I wanted to find somewhere special, somewhere different to the excellent chain hotels we normally use. We couldn't have found a better place to stay.  From the moment we arrived the personal service achieved exactly what we wanted - the feeling of a special weekend just for us. Our bags were whisked off to our room, we were introduced to the lounge area and shown the various facilities for drinks, food, etc.  We stayed in an executive suite that was beautifully furnished with the highlight being, for me, a very large bathroom with a separate bath and shower. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and very large.…"
November 2016,"Boutique, personal and elegant.","We stayed for x2 nights 10 / 11 November in an executive King room with lounge access. We stay in London often, always for leisure, and try different hotels. This was lovely. Very elegant and romantic and worth trying if you're after something a bit different in a really good position in London.  The rooms are not large but they are well laid out for both business and couples. The bed was uber comfortable for us. The hotel doesn't have all the gadgets some other top hotels have but everything is well laid out, easy to use and elegant. Reading lights, well positioned mirrors, robes, kettle and plenty of pillows. We particularly enjoyed coming back to the room and the 'open' fire would be lit and a hot water bottle in the bed. We are always too warm so enjoyed the effective air…"
October 2016,fair and nice hotel,"the hotel has a really nice decoration and interior with classic designs and furniture. The rooms are also very cozy, the bed a little too soft though. Reception staff was nice and serviceminded and we had a great stay."
October 2016,Outstanding!!,"My Fiancé (well he is now) and I stayed at Hotel 41 on 27 October and we couldn't have asked for a better experience! The stay was part of my proposal and the staff, particularly Florent, couldn't have been more helpful. In the lead up to the stay they were in communication to get things organised and told him he could contact them 24/7.  The hotel is absolutely amazing, down to all the little details from the champagne on arrival, to contacting the restaurant we were visiting in the evening to confirm our booking, to the little treats left in the room.  When we got back to the room after a celebration dinner our room had been decorated and we had been left a bottle of champagne and a congratulations cake (again organised by the wonderful Florent!).  From the moment you arrive…"
November 2016,Outstanding London Hotel,What makes a stay is the service and support that you receive from the staff. This is the best hotel experience. We stay here often. Wish we had one of these hotels in the states. Great location for tourists. Updated rooms and many extras.
November 2016,What an amazing hotel!,"My husband and I stayed here for our 10th Wedding Anniversary, from the moment we stepped into the building we were made to feel so welcome and special by the excellent staff and beautiful surroundings. Quite honestly I could go on and on about how wonderful this hotel is but to keep it simple- champagne check in /constant supply of complimentary snacks/ lovely rooms/ fantastic staff-friendly, attentive, nothing was too much trouble. For us the feeling that we were somewhere special and yet made to feel so at home, is why we would love to return in the future!  For a bit of perspective we also stayed at the Shangri-La Hotel in The Shard this weekend- this was also a lovely hotel with a beautiful room, fantastic city views and friendly staff. But if you asked my husband or myself…"
November 2016,Wonderful ... but,"This is a special hotel, small and intimate with staff attending to your ever whim.  If you book direct you get  a £50 credit, although I didn't notice till checkout. We stayed with our grown up son and booked two executive king rooms, felt they were on the small side and every surface was taken up with 'information' making it difficult to put your own belongings anywhere, a bit too fussy for us.  The rooms were immaculate and well maintained, the beds comfy and even a hot water bottle at turndown. The 'centre' of the hotel is the executive lounge which doubles as the restaurant, bar, meeting area and check-in.  Food which is included in the tariff is available all day.  It's very pleasant but doesn't provide an intimate area, as at anytime people can be at the desk checking…"
September 2016,Perfect!!!,My husband and I had a great time at the hotel. The young receptionist was very welcoming and our room was huge (London is famous for not offering very big rooms)  The toilet was shiny and fancy. Will definitely ho back!
November 2016,Excellent,"We have had a recent stay at the hotel for my husbands birthday. Lovely 5 star hotel which is conveniently located to see the main visitor attractions. The hotel staff are attentive to your every need with nothing seeming to be any trouble at all. Attention to detail is exquisite and well thought out and executed. Wide choice range for breakfast and snacks.  Our room was big enough for the two of us, was comfortable and clean. We have experienced many a turn down service in different hotels over the years but this one was special so well done.  We will return a gem of a place well done"
November 2016,Hotel 41,"World class 5 Star luxury, white marble floors with black inserts, dark wood doors and accents , beautiful plants and lobby with lavish furniture. The staff is professional and knowledgeable on everything about the hotel and the city. They have restaurants, shops, gym, suites, jr. suites. I had a room it was on par with the size of rooms in US. It had white walls, art work on the walls, fireplace, desk, bar, leather chair, TV, mini bar, comfortable bed and quite. The bathroom was well equipped. If you left your room you could go to the executive lounge. If you left the hotel it was a great location in the city, and it was near the tube. I was overnight only on way to a cruse, will never get another stay, it cost three times what I normally pay."
November 2016,Best hotel ever,Never have I stayed in a better hotel.My husband and I stayed here for our 30th wedding anniversary. From start to finish it was fantastic. Not just a hotel but a huge part of our holiday. Hard to drag ourselves away.  Every little detail has been thought of. Staff are welcoming and friendly. Rooms beautiful.   Real 5 star luxury. We won't be staying anywhere else now  Thank you
May 2016,Luxurious rooms and charming atmosphere :),"Couldn't find a single flaw in this hotel. Absolutely recommend it to anyone. The service was really kind, everything was clean and the food was also great! There is no place for disappointment here! Would visit again."
November 2016,Wonderful Ruby Anniversary experience,"Hotel 41 was one of the best hotels we have stayed in . From the minute we arrived we were looked after by the extremely friendly and helpful staff. The hotel is beautifully decorated and our room was amazing . There was so much attention to detail and nothing was too much trouble . Our children and grandchildren joined us for a superb carvery lunch in the Rubens hotel next door (part of the same group) . The hotel was in a great location , very close to the palace and also within easy reach of the theatres and shopping . We would definitely highly recommend this hotel . Don't miss out on a fabulous experience. Can't praise it enough ."
November 2016,Better than I remembered,"We were torn as to which hotel was our favorite in London, Hotel 41 or Chiltern Firehouse. Unfortunately, my husband and I are still divided. I love both hotels equally, but my husband slightly prefers Hotel 41 because of the incredibly comfortable bed, the complimentary ice cream bar and the best shower in town. That said, I am 50/50 on which I prefer more, but I will say that Hotel 41 is definitely an extraordinary hotel, which I always enjoy staying at."
July 2016,Awesome...,"Stayed at the 41 for 3 nights. The hotel is just amazing. The drinks are a bit $$$, but who cares. No money, no fun!! You can help yourself at the bar 24hr. Never seen this before.  The staff are very friendly and think out of the box. I will return in January to the 41. Keep up the good work."
August 2016,Superb,Amazing g hotel and a real treat. Having only stayed here once I can't wait to try out another room in this stunning hotel. Staff couldn't do any more to be Helpfull! Visually the hotel is just Stunning! 
August 2016,Best Stay Anywhere,"My wife and I took our first trip to London and we stayed at Hotel 41. It was the most pleasant experience we've ever had at a hotel and we certain would recommend staying here. The decor of the hotel is very pleasant and everything worked as expected, but what made this stay wonderful was the staff. Everyone was extraordinarily professional and helpful and went out of their way to make sure our stay was perfect. We'd like to thank Florent, Magdalena, Nicole, Marta, Dominic, Maria, Jonathan, Mathilda, and several others whose names we didn't get for the wonderful experience. It's also conveniently located near Buckingham palace which made it easy to walk to a lot of interesting historical locations and restaurants. It was also easy to get a taxi, bus, or train to any location we…"
November 2016,Second to none!,"Absolutely fabulous hotel and couldn't recommend it more.  Service by the staff from the time of booking throughout our entire stay couldn't have been any more exceptional.  Their attention to detail and making you feel warm, welcomed and valued made this an absolutely unforgettable experience.  This will be our new residence whenever in London."
November 2016,Fab for price I paid ,"Myself and my two daughters came down for a Friday - Sunday stay as a treat For my daughters birthday, staff were friendly , the room was nice  and the service couldn't be knocked at all! the location of the hotel was perfect for anyone after a city stay , and transport was fine ! The only one minor minor issue was the heat of the room and the air con was not working, but the staff were quick to send a fan up to the room which helped matters out strait away! Brilliant all Round and will definitely be using again  A very happy mum! "
June 2016,Amazing hotel,"This hotel definitely enhanced my experience in London. Its design is unparalleled, the service was exemplary, and the dining was truly finest. The location is perfect if you're visiting for the first time.  Will definitely visit again.  "
November 2016,Great great great,Very fantastic  i think i will visit it again and again this hotel is very  elegant  and it make me crazy to visit again and again i advice all to visit  and they will  never regret peace peace peace and love 
November 2016,Outstanding!,"We stayed as a family (with our 2 sons ages 7 and 9) for 4 days from November 3rd - 6th, 2016 to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary. Staying at Hotel 41 literally made our trip. It is in a fantastic location, close to the sights at Buckingham Palace, walking distance to the London Eye, etc. The service was impeccable. The staff knew who we all were upon arrival and made every effort to help us feel at home. We stayed in the Balmoral Suite, which offered the ability for my kids to sleep in an adjoining smaller room. The hotel has an old world charm but offered every amenity we needed. The bed was very comfortable and sheets and towels clean and fluffy.  The lounge was a favorite, we ate there twice a day, breakfast and dinner were delicious and my kids loved ""Plunder the…"
July 2016,Amazing Botique Hotel,"Hotel 41 is a luxurious experience. I highly recommend that you stay here. Wonderful, attentive staff and a great location. The library is beautifully appointed and they attend to your every whim. Get the yogurt for breakfast....it is the best I have ever had."
October 2016,Excellent 41,Nice hotel situated in a beautiful place . The hotel having a wonderful management team ...all the staffs are very good even the ground staff also. I really appreciate all of them for making the hotel as heaven . I thank them to give me all the helps ....
October 2016,Hotel 41,"The door in question is on Buckingham Palace Road, next to the Rubens hotel, which Red Carnation also owns. Although it feels separate, 41 occupies the Rubens's former offices on the building's top floor, and a lift from 41's striking black and white lobby whisks you up to its striking black and white bedrooms. Front-facing rooms look down into the Royal Mews opposite – heaven for American guests. The former boardroom of the Rubens is the heart of 41, a mahogany clad ""Executive Lounge"" with conservatory roof, honesty bar and complimentary light buffet 24 hours a day. Black-suited staff hover, with red carnations in their buttonholes."
October 2016,Brilliant - absolutely amazing.,"Sometimes we get to experience something so unique - so special - that it rocks the foundation about what we thought to be true. Such was the case with my recent stay at Hotel 41. While I thought I knew what excellent service and attention to detail were prior to this visit, I now have new definitions for those words as they relate to hotels.  I traveled to London on a special trip with my eight-year old daughter. From the moment we stepped into the lobby, we were treated with care and made to feel as if we were the only guests staying at 41. Staff went out of their way to make my daughter's experience one she will never forget, and were incredibly helpful booking tickets to local attractions and even helped with Eurostar to Paris. The food was fantastic. High Tea was…"
October 2016,Quality!,"Fantastic hotel - 5 star quality and service. I can't say enough about Hotel 41. The staff were outstanding down to the smallest details. Our room was impeccable, truly no complaints. We stayed for 5 nights and thoroughly enjoyed the executive lounge (which really feels like a library/gentleman's club). We had fantastic breakfasts in there every morning with cocktails and snacks in the afternoons and night caps after our evenings out. Highest quality drinks and food - a remarkable home away from home. We will definitely stay here again next time we are in London. The location couldn't be more convenient either. Well done Hotel 41!!!"
June 2016,Great - Comfortable Stay!,"What a Gorgeous Holidays! happy to have found an outstanding discount for this Hotel! at - is.gd/gothotel  The food in general was great, mouthwatering and pleasant! with lots of choices!  Their personnel were very friendly and helpful - throughout the whole stay.  The room was clean, big, and precisely arranged, Good sized bed and big bathroom."
June 2016,Great hotel!,"The staff was very polite, food was fantastic also. All in All I would rate this hotel 5 out of 5 stars! I was with my family, everyone liked the environment, people were friendly. We spent hours in the cozy lounge area. The hotel is tastefully and thoughfully decorated."
October 2016,ONE OF THE BEST BOUTIQUE HOTELS ANYWHERE 5 STAR TO THE MAX,"from the moment you arrive, the friendliness of the staff, the hard wood antique beauty of lobby and room is so magnificent and very british.......hardwoods,etc. the executive lounge was so inviting and the food and and drink were first class in every sense. The staff could not be more accommodating. I could not be more pleased and give this property my highest rating."
September 2016,Perfect honeymoon destination,"I booked a 3 night stay as a surprise for our honeymoon and was dubious about staying at the Hotel 41 as thought that it may be 'over the top' however, everything was absolutely perfect.  As previous reviews had suggested the surroundings are more like a gentlemans club.  On first impression, our room didn't seem very big however this had more I believe to do with the non standard shape, we soon got used to it and it turned out to be fine.  Everything was of the best quality, as you'd expect, for a 5 star hotel, we weren't disappointed.  All members of the team made us feel really special and seemed genuinely interested in us and our plans.  We were 'wowed' on several occasions by special touches including returning to our room one evening to find rose petals and candles.  I…"
September 2016,Perfect !,"People say it doesn't matter where you stay since you don't spend a lot of time in your room when you're on vacation. Staying at the Hotel 41 will change that perspective.  It was such an elegant, yet ""home-like"" atmosphere that we looked forward to our return each day to have a drink, chat with the staff and just sit back and enjoy our time at the hotel. Florent, Andrew and Dominic felt like old friends.  They tended to everything...whether we needed it or not. They anticipated things before you had to ask....really amazing !   Now I know why this is rated the best hotel in London.  I was sad to leave and will definitely return when we visit London again.   Room advise: We booked the Junior suite which has an upstairs and a downstairs.  it was nice to have the extra space but a…"
September 2016,Wonderful!,"Words can't really express how wonderful this hotel is, but I'll try!  We stayed one night before going on the Orient Express to celebrate my aunt/uncle 50th anniversary and our 25th and this was the perfect start to the holiday.  We were surprised and delighted to be upgraded to suites which were amazing, clean and so comfortable and with  lovely anniversary cakes waiting for us.   The decor in this hotel is beautiful and the lounge is elegant yet so relaxed you don't want to leave it.  All the lovely little touches such as the glass of champagne on arrival, the 'plunder the pantry' treats make Hotel 41 special and unique and yet it is somehow a relaxed luxury.  But without a doubt, the staff are the best ever.  The wonderful doorman/concierge, the lovely reception and…"
September 2016,MADE MY BIRTHDAY TOP NOTCH,"I was worried about staying at a Hotel I was not familiar with.  This Hotel was the biggest surprise & delight one could imagine.  The staff knows all about you within minutes,  they want to do everything to please you,  I do not think I will ever stay elsewhere!!! Just absolutely lovely!!!"
August 2016,Memorable stay,Spent 4 nights here recently and all I can say is that the reviews are spot on! The hotel offers immaculate service and products. Truly special and a must-try for those who are on the fence. Highly recommended!!!
September 2016,Can't wait to come back!!,"No wonder this hotel has the accolade of 'the best hotel in London' ! Every single thing , from the champagne on arrival, to the complimentary treats always on offer, is tailored to make your stay here as pleasant as possible. The staff are absolutely fabulous, really genuinely helpful and always smiling and friendly. The room was a good size, comfortable, spotlessly clean with many lovely additions all designed to give maximum comfort and luxury .  Check out the salt beef sandwich in their cafe next door (B Bar) and the cocktails in their sister hotel- Ruebens on the other side ! Loved it and thanks for a fabulous time ! See you very soon 😊"
September 2016,Should be called Hotel #1,"I thoroughly enjoyed every part of my stay at the Hotel 41.  The stay starts with an easy check in, made easier by the champagne being poured while you sit in a comfortable leather chair and get introduced to the hotel and shown to your room. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was adequate. Every night little treats showed up ranging from chocolate to mind quieting pillow spray to recovery eye cream. Nice treats. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful with anything you could ever ask for. Special shout out to Steve Jones who poured our champagne upon arrival and engaged at other times in excellent conversation. Breakfast was always good and sometimes too much food to finish. Great location, just steps from Buckingham Palace. I could go on and on. I would highly…"
September 2016,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,"Hotel 41 was the perfect way to start our honeymoon. We spent 3 nights in London before traveling on. After landing at 7 am after a full day of travel we were greeted with a glass of chilled champagne in the plush lounge. The staff acclimated us to the hotel and services provided. Then, we were shown to the spacious beautiful room. We were thankful it was ready for us so early. Every evening people would gather in the lounge for ""raid the pantry."" It was a wonderful way to wind down from our busy days. We highly recommend this adorable gem of a hotel. "
September 2016,#1 for a Reason,"My wife and I arrived to find out I had a reservation for October!!! we had arrived a month earlier! The team in the hotel didn't turn me back, worked miracles and managed to accommodate us despite my mistake. Everyone was helpful, really friendly and accommodating. We loved the lounge area, like an oasis away from the city hustle. So from a potential disaster - Hotel41 turned this around into a fantastic weekend break. Special Thanks to Adele, Lauren, Mitchel, Florent and all the names I forgot!!! Hope to return soon!"
September 2016,Only one word : perfection,"Perfect from the first step to the end. Downstairs, when arriving, the welcoming is great with fruits and sweets proposals as well as tea and coffee. Very friendly check-in in the lounge with a glass of champagne or tea (with home-made cookies) or whatever. The Executive lounge is within a library with beautiful ancient books and a very cosy wood area. In the afternoon, you have a small buffet with nuts - sweets - drinks - cookies and delicious ice creams. For afternoon tea, perfect warm scones. We were upgraded in a suite and it was perfect (2 levels). Everything was great from the quality of the bed to the coffee and tea set, from plenty of amenities for the bathroom to the welcoming sweets....(one week before our arrival, we received a mail asking us what we like to eat and…"
May 2016,Hotel 41 Lives Up to the Fantastic Reviews,"We chose this hotel based on other Trip Advisor reviews and we weren't disappointed. This hotel is amazing - it's a small hotel with beautiful rooms and the service is top notch. The staff here is professional and attentive.  We started and ended each day in the executive lounge -- this made our stay!  Wonderful breakfast, great snacks, drinks and desert in the evening - it all made for such a great experience.  Yes, the hotel is expensive but its truly worth it.  We had a fantastic time and would love to stay at Hotel 41 again!"
September 2016,Unexpected perfection,"My husband and I just returned from a short trip to London and this time we decided to try a different hotel. We are so happy we did, what a truly five star experience. We love the small boutique feel of this hotel and the staff always went above and beyond (which I can't say always is the case in the U.K.).   The lounge had a very welcoming fell, we had a few meals here and other than the food taking a while to come out, was perfection.   We'll be back!"
September 2016,Number 1 in the world,"What can I say: brilliant! This is the most beautiful hotel I have ever stayed in. There may not be much real estate but they certainly make up for it with service. Don't get me wrong. The rooms are lovely and roomy. But the service is second to none! Verve on arrival. Daily fruit basket in the room. Snacks all day. Beautiful breakfasts. Free water. Even a lock for my suitcase upon departure. It is the little things that make the stay so much more pleasant, lovely and comfortable. It is worth every dollar. I would like to come back just to stay here."
August 2016,Amazing Service ,The service at this hotel is phenomenal with the staff making you feel like a regular from the first minute you arrive. The food and location are also great with the only minor drawback being the small rooms. 
August 2016,Best Hotel in London,"Hotel 41 is by far the best hotel in London! If you are looking for top notch service, a stunning room, excellent staff and amenities this is the hotel to stay at. Right next to Buckingham Palace it boasts pure elegance and is close enough to everything you want to see. I will definitely only being staying here the next time I am in London!"
July 2016,Best hotel in Londn,"This is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. The room was large, stylish and beautifully furnished; we were treated like royalty at breakfast, the service were impeccable; a wonderful location and the well appointed bar encouraged us to stay in hotel. This hotel certainly has the formula right."
October 2016,Family celebration,"A huge rush to return to our London home - Hotel 41 - as we prepared for our granddaughter's christening.  Our son flew in from his home abroad and we were reunited in the Executive Lounge, where the team discreetly poured champagne as we happily embraced.  We spent the day catching up with family matters and relaxed royally in the front of the fire with canapes and later Plunder the Pantry laced with Walker Bay - a wonderful white wine - as we chattered.  A good night's rest in perfectly arranged rooms - thank you, housekeeping - followed by a sumptuous breakfast, and we set off for the christening.  Team 41 are beautifully presented -  as well as smiling, helpful and aware of every little thing that could or should be done for guests.  Attention to detail is their creed, and…"
October 2016,Staff goes above and beyond-extraordinary service,"Creature comforts galore-hot water bottle in your turned down bed, candle lit in bathroom, perfect pillows, sheets and duvets, saran wrapped remote controls,  clean relaxing room, plenty of product, beautiful lounge for guests of ""41"" only. Lounge is stunning, quiet, with nice wines, liquors and munchies if you're hungry.   Staff can't do enough for you from start to finish and make it clear they are available to take care of your every need.   Wonderful, comfortable, caring, loving very small boutique hotel that makes you want to come back-really soon"
August 2016,Delightful stay.,"We stayed in the 41 Hotel seven nights in August. The experience was excellent. The hotel's location was ideal for us with easy access to the tube and easy walking distance to restaurants and shopping. The staff and their overall service was wonderful. I generally hold the impression nice hotels in Europe particularly in European cities and especially in London are very, very expensive, however, after taking everything into consideration offered by 41 during our stay I must admit it was a good value and I would not hesitate to book there for our next visit."
October 2016,Fab!,"Amazing hotel!  All staff are very welcoming and helpful. Especially Steve the bartender, very good service and friendly!  Room was lovely and clean. Food was great!  Perfect location. Staff helpful at getting you a round the city.    "
October 2016,Luxury Weekend ,"We chose the 41 hotel based on its tripadvisor status and were definitely not disappointed. An excellent, intimate hotel, with lovely staff.  Make sure to make the most of the executive lounge, the constant supply of delicious food means you really get your money's worth!  The rooms were beautiful too, luxurious and spacious, just right.  Definitely looking forward to coming back!"
October 2016,Absolutely great hotel and extremely friend and helpful staff,"We booked this hotel as a birthday treat for my daughters birthday. When arriving there the hotel is easily missed as there is only one real marker on the street showing its location. That would be my only minor criticism.  On arrival our, we were greeted at the front desk (not the check in desk as this was in the executive lounge on the 5th floor). Our bags were taken to our rooms and we were taken to the lounge. Checkin was complete by an open fireplace with complementary champagne.  Our rooms were exceptional. Ours even had a working fireplace. My wife seemed to be amazed that they even had a hot water bottle for us to use if needed. The rooms were well equipped, and considering we were in the heart of London, the traffic noise was not noticeable. In fact my wife even…"
October 2016,More than  first class ,"My daughter booked  this  hotel for us as a special  treat for my birthday and oh my this is a very special place. I have never experienced service like this. From the moment  we  entered  the  hotel we were welcomed with warmth and smiles and birthday wishes. Our luggage was whisked away from  us and we were escorted by Mitch to the 5th  floor to complete the check in process??? Well I have over the years  stayed in numerous  hotels in London  and  around  the world but never have  I sat in a comfy  chair and been served  a glass of champagne  of my choice whilst completing registration forms woww. A review could never do this hotel justice, from the complimentary food served throughout the day and into the night, that unfortunately we were unable to take advantage of due to a…"
October 2016,Loved our stay here!,This was one of the best hotels that we have stayed at. We felt welcome from the moment we drove up. We were offered a glass of champagne or water or coffee upon arrival.  We requested early check in and our room was ready at 10am when we arrived.  The staff was  friendly and attentive and truly nice people.  The rooms were clean and cozy and had wonderful amenities.  Breakfast was included and plenty to choose from.  Our stay was only for two nights but we loved it so much we didn't want to leave.  We highly recommend it and will be back.
April 2016,Omg where did I just stay!!,The staff here are helping caring and so kind I felt at home once I just stepped in. It's quality of the room are really amazing I fell asleep at once. It's not a lot of money at all for such high quality. It is placed in a good area. If you go to London you have to go her!!!
February 2016,In a different league  !!,It really is a cut above the others that I have visited.  The service is outstanding from start to finish.  Welcomed with free Champagne on check-in ( choose from a menu with all high end bottles on offer ) then showed to the room which had 3 bathroooms. The complimentary pantry is a nice touch in the sitting room  as was the bottle of chilled  champagne awaiting us in the room on our return from an evening out. A special visit to a special hotel.
September 2016,Wonderful anniversary and birthday celebration,"My husband booked a weekend at Hotel 41 for my birthday and our first wedding anniversary celebration. It was magical. The other reviews describe it perfectly - impeccable service, lovely rooms, amazing rooms. The pantry was awesome. The value (I think) is excellent because you get lots of complimentary treats. The Penhaligon toiletries were divine, so much so that I went to the store to buy some the next day. Unfortunately they are made especially for hotels...oh well, looks like I'll have to book another stay! Thanks to all the staff, especially Mitch who was super friendly and always remembered our name."
August 2016,First trip to London,"We chose Hotel 41 for our first trip to London and we couldn't be happier with our decision. This hotel was perfect for our family. The accommodations were impeccable and no detail too small. The employees went out of their way to make each of us feel comfortable and special - every single day for nearly two weeks! Andrew supplied our 11 year old daughter with Dr. Who details. Several staff members enjoyed talking Harry Potter with her on a daily basis. Once we returned home, we missed Stefan's stories as well as Edgar's late night drinks and company. We are still talking about the friends we made at this hotel. It's just that personal. We've never stayed any where quite this special - except for maybe home. "
September 2016,Worthy of It's Number One Rating,"I can't really say a lot more to emphasize this place is perfect as a small hotel.  Elegant, beautiful, outstanding service, great location.  Rooms are gorgeous.  Staff is friendly and fun, much more so than their stuffy competitors, The Connaught and Claridge's.  Entrance is a bit obscure and we had sort of a hassle unloading our rental car in front because of construction cones blocking the front entrance.  Go. Enjoy."
August 2016,The Best Hotel in Town,"For style, service, fine wine, excellent dining, perfect location, comfort, exclusivity and total spoiling of the dogs this hotel can't be beaten.  We will certainly be staying again and can hardly wait."
September 2016,Simply devine,"After a trip around australia with my mum, returned to a new life in London and whilst awaiting our apartment to be ready spoilt ourselves with a stay at 41.  Just spectacular!  The hotel is just beautiful but it is the service that is standout.  A pleasure to be addressed by your first name when coming by staff, attention to detail is amazing.  Rooms are specious and the use of the executive lounge was a bonus.    I will miss my home in Sydney and weekends away in the beautiful HunterValley but with hotels like this nearby- I will certainly be taking some regular  Fabulous London urban getaways at 41.  "
September 2016,Retirement surprise for my wife ,"It's hard to pick out highlights from a 2 night stay that was a continual highlight. Everything was faultless. The level of service was something I hadn't experienced before.  The warmth and friendliness of the staff was outstanding (in particular, Adele and Andrew, and Siobhan and Frank from The Rubens).  If you want to experience the best, stay at Hotel 41.  "
September 2016,Top hotel,"Stayed at this hotel for a long weekend through a deal on travelzoo,  Executive King at a very good price,  Overlooking a busy street but very quiet inside, Luxury comfort and attentiveness what more can you ask for."
September 2016,We miss the Hotel 41!,"We’ve recently returned from our fourth stay at the Hotel 41, this one for 9 nights.  Incredible hotel with wonderful staff. We miss them all so much!    The location right across the Royal Mews and mid-way between Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station is perfect. The hotel itself is beautiful and has the finest amenities. The Executive Lounge is beautiful with gorgeous woodwork, a fireplace and a gorgeous glass skylight. We are casual people and don’t feel at all out of place. At night with the candles lit, the ambiance is perfect. Meals are served here as well as evening canapes and then Plunder the Pantry. This feature alone makes a stay at the Hotel 41 worthwhile! Tasty hot entre, breads, cheeses, seafood, salads and desserts are all part of Plunder. The last evening of our…"
October 2016,What a gem!!,"We booked this hotel as a stop over in London on our way to South Africa and because we really like Red Carnation Hotels. We were not disappointed, the excellence of the facility, staff and location were exactly what we have come to appreciate with this hotel group. The lounge was a delight to be used and savoured with a quality of service without compare. We will be back and keep up the very high standard."
June 2016,nice stay in a exiciting city,We had a nice couple of nights at this hotel me and my wife. Breakfast was served in a nice restaurant with cozy atmosphere and the service overall was really great. Rooms could be bigger and the beds a bit softer.
August 2016,"Beautiful decor, amazing staff","We visited for 2nights back in August, the location is excellent and the rooms were luxurious! The staff were very attentive and helpful, for example when we asked for extra pillows and clean sheets they arrived instantly as if they were waiting outside the door. We will be coming back for sure!"
October 2016,One of the finest hotel experiences in the world,"I have stayed in many 5 star and luxury hotels.  Most were memorable and some quite sublime.  Service is the foundation of any good hotel.  I know that sounds obvious but pulling it off is no easy task.  Hotel 41 does ""service"" unlike any place I have ever stayed in and they do it brilliantly!  The staff is friendly, earnest, funny and attentive to your smallest need.  Their staff is always present and ""in the zone"" when they interact with you.  The smallest detail or request is expertly accommodated.  This place is a gem!"
September 2016,Ultimate comfort and great service.,"We stayed for two nights in September.  The hotel's location is excellent, the staff really do care about their guests.  I, unfortunately, was sick on the day we arrived and was given a room to rest while our room was being prepared for us.  This was the best bed, the best bedding, the best pillows, the best shower and bath.... I could go on.   A real treat for us."
October 2016,A place where luxury & privacy both mainatined,"Hotel 41 became one of my favorites on the first visit. Recently I spent 2 nights 1 day there. The hotel is so luxurious and service is outstanding. My room was clean & tidy and in perfect condition, and staff showed excellent professionalism to detail in preparing for my arrival and in housekeeping services every day. Thank you."
October 2016,Very special place..,"An absolutely fabulous experience.  We recently spent 3 nights at Hotel 41 and it surpassed our expectation in every way.  It's a lovely boutique hotel with very elegant and tasteful rooms, but the best part of our experience was the highly attentive and friendly service. Virtually every member of the staff immediately knew us by name, and bent over backwards to insure that no detail was left to chance.  A truly memorable stay."
July 2016,Needs More to be called the best hotel in London!,"There is not question that 41 offers a lot. You are greeted with a choice of champagnes and pastries My room was lovely and the help tried to be accommodating but the concierge had to go to the internet for information, There is food almost all day included in your room rate,.  But I t is hard to determine when you pay for a cup of tea and when it is included. I knew more than the concierge -  no crossed keys. I was given incorrect opening times and luckily I had another place to go. Nobody opens the door or taxi, and if the person at the desk is on the phone and you have a bag you may have a problem getting in. This is related to the Rubens hotel next door, and frankly that has people who are more knowledgeable about what is going on and how to run a 1st class hotel."
September 2016,Probably the best hotel I've ever stayed at,"The entire staff is fantastic. We arrived early and were provided with a courtesy room as our room wasn't ready yet.  No hotel has ever done this for me.  We were also provided a courtesy room after checkout to bridge the timegap until we had to leave for our flight.  Amazing service.   The black/white style is very nice. There are delicious complimentary snacks available all the time.  There were two showers in our Executive King, and they both had ample pressure and heat.  They even had a real door unlike many European showers.  I don't think I'll bother looking for another hotel in London.  If/when we return, we'll be coming back here."
September 2016,Faultless ,Subtle attentiveness from the onset!  There was a fluidity of service which made our stay both comfortable and homely without being over bearing.  Without going into too much detail this was quite simply one of the best hotel experiences we have had to date. We are looking forward to discovering what the sistering hotels have to offer. 
September 2016,Best Hotel stay ever!,We loved every aspect of our stay. We are already planning our return visit. This hotel is worth every penny- we had the experience of a lifetime. The staff was thoughtful and attentive to every detail. We loved one stay and we will be back without a doubt!!
May 2016,Unreal !,Loved this place. Could stay forever. What a beautiful architecture and design within the illustrious corridors and walls. The art deco theme is unforgettable. They also have a lot of history and tour guide books within the hotel for those interested in it.
September 2016,"Five stars, frankly, aren't enough","Simply cannot say enough good things about Hotel 41. From the minute we set foot out of the cab until we left days later, this team of people anticipated and exceeded every thing we wanted or needed.  The rooms are lovely. Beds perfect. Appointments wonderful. It's quiet at night.  The Executive Lounge started and ended every day - with breakfast impeccably prepared and served.  Pre dinner cocktails were relaxing and welcoming.  Special recognition to Steve who leads this part of the experience.  We much enjoyed our quickly developed relationship.  His recommendations for dining were well thought out.  Wine suggestions spot on.  The team of folks who are part of the front desk/concierge are friendly, efficient, thoughtful, helpful. Always available.  Maria & Adele, in…"
September 2016,Totally Perfect,"This hotel would be worth visiting for the ambiance, quality of decor, standard of rooms, superb array of day long treats and food in the lounge alone, BUT should NOT be missed when in London to experience the service provided by the AMAZING staff. Every single person shows exemplary professionalism and provides a standard of customer service not experienced in any other luxury hotel anywhere in the world.  I could write pages giving examples of the above but my title says it all - ""Totally Perfect""! "
September 2016,What a gem!,Had an amazing nights stay - treated my hubby for his 60th birthday ! We were upgraded to a suite which was fabulous! There is nothing to fault about this little gem in the heart of London!   Every member of staff offered a first class service - nothing was too much trouble!  Cannot recommend this place enough - it really is special - you will not be disappointed ! I am saving again and can't wait to visit again but next time for longer !!!
September 2016,Best Hotel Ever ,"Booked Hotel 41 after reading about it in the times some time ago. I wanted a special place to bring my lovely Daughter who has just finished her Masters. They spoilt us from the moment we arrived with champagne. We where upgraded to a lovely Suite. The decor and furnishings totally luxurious. Then began three days and evenings of total luxury and indulgence. The staff are so lovely. I have never come across so many kind helpful and simply amazing people in my life.  Hotel 41 is not just a hotel it's an experience. Full of surprises everything done beautifully. Thank you for the thoughtful touches the congratulations cake. The Harry Potter hats and fruit, the gorgeous Flowers you sourced for me. So many thoughtful details.  And plunder the pantry a grazers heaven.  If you want…"
September 2016,Great Luxury Hotel,Hotel 41 is a great boutique hotel in a great location in London. The service was second to none. We enjoyed having the 24 hour snacks and bar service. Every staff member was well informed and friendly.
April 2016,Perfect Romantic Hotel,"After getting wed on the Southbank I'd booked this Hotel for the evening - not realising after that it was perhaps a little excessive for such a short stay, but it was worth it.  Arriving around 11.30 pm we were welcome with Champagne at the check in and quickly made to feel at home - after dropping off  the bags in the room, we took advantage of the midnight larder, enjoying a nice warm dish and some selections from the meat and cheese boards.  The room was split level and had a nice fireplace, all decked out with fine pictures and nice furnishings through out. Very comfortable room and a cake had been left with Congratulations written on it and scattering of rose petals around the place.  Breakfast in the morning was a veritable selection of whatever you wanted, more…"
October 2015,Brilliant,This place is one of the best hotels in the British Isles. The first thing is the exutive lounge is very comfortable and a good place to have a drink or two. Another thing is this place has a fantastic view of Buckingham Palace. This hotel is more of a private club than a hotel. The conservatory suite is beautiful and a different experience. The romantic turndown was brilliant. The room had a breathtaking view of the Royal mews. The red rose petals were gorgeous. The complentry snacks were great and given out by the best staff in the world. The champagne they gave out was brilliant and I was quite amazed when they offered me it. I will certainly pick the Red Carnatation hotels in the future.
September 2016,Brief Visit Home 9/4-9/6,"Great and lovely hotel by far the best Britain has to offer. Concierge and hotel staff are wonderfully polite and often greet you, and there isn't a need they won't fulfil. Probably one of the best representations of British hospitality I've ever actually encountered and as a first time visitor here earlier this month I will definitely be back. "
April 2016,Wonderful hotel,This gem is perfect! Small with an unassuming entrance just down the road from Buckingham Palace. The entire visit was enjoyable. Food is amazing and staff outstanding. The even have a list of staff who will exercise with you. Just ask!
July 2016,BEST hotel in the world,"Without a doubt, this is the most incredible hotel I have ever and probably will ever stay. Nothing will ever come close. Florent and the rest of the staff are world class. Absolutely anything you need is taken care of by them. I stayed here for six days with family and they treated us like we were part of theirs. Relaxing in the lounge every night felt like coming home after a long day of touring/shopping. The rooms were gorgeous, and the location cannot be beat. We were so sad to leave. I don't know when I'll be back, but I can't wait! If you're planning a trip to London, look no further!"
September 2016,Simply the best ,"Words cannot begin to describe how amazing this hotel is.  You were greeted after a long flight with a glass of Veuve Clicquot, which pretty much sets the stage for the rest of the stay. There isn't anything staff wouldn't do for you, and They will always do it with a smile. The rooms are impeccable, timeless, contemporary, individualized, and gorgeous all the same time. All the food we had there was delicious. The service was second to none, and they took excellent care of our entire family, including our five-year-old son, whom they made honorary manager. Don't stay anywhere else in London, you will not be disappointed, I have stayed in many 5 star resorts throughout the world and this was honestly our favorite!! Enjoy your time there!"
September 2016,The BEST Hotel ever ,"We have just stayed 3 nights at this wonderful hotel. Traveling with my husband and sister. Her room was ready when we arrived, but ours was not so they put us into a courtesy room where we could freshen up and take a little nap! That was the beginning of 3 days of being spoiled rotten!  The hotel executive lounge is a constant food fest. There are always snacks out in addition to more substantial fare. The staff new our names from the start and by the second morning knew what we liked for breakfast!  Our friends joined us for breakfast one morning and they set us up in a private little room!! Every night there was s little surprise on the pillow and when we got back to the hotel after seeing ""Wicked"" there were Wicked themed cupcakes waiting for us!  The hotel was clean,…"
March 2016,Probably the best experience ever at a small hotel,"This review is a little late since our stay was in March 2016, but I want to do it because I think the hotel deserves the accolades.    My 14 year old son and I stayed here for a week at Easter. I have never felt so safe and so pampered at any hotel. If you want a big hotel with a lot of amenities, don't stay here. If you want a small hotel where everyone knows your name, knows what you like and anticipates your wants/needs, this is the place.   We stayed in a junior suite which has two levels. It's not the most spacious set up (a little too small in the bedroom area) but the room was beautiful nonetheless. The bathroom was huge with a big soaking tub and separate shower. Lots of natural lighting. Beds were super comfortable and the hot water bottle under the sheets when…"
September 2016,stunning hotel in london,"I really can't say enough about the quality of attention and service given by the staff.  During my 1 week stay I had one minor complaint about the temperature of the hot water in my room, and they had it fixed by the time I came back from dinner. Excellent hotel .excellent service ,excellent to my trip thanks alot"
September 2016,"WOW, WOW, WOW what a stay!!","The staff was brilliant and welcoming. Truly engaging at all turns, and made you feel like you were a guest in their personal home. The wonderful ladies at the front desk were so helpful and even assisted with us booking a train to see High Claire castle.  The room was small based on US standards but was adequate and well appointed. The shower and bath pressure were amazing! Like nothing I have ever experienced before. I would also be refreshed after taking a shower! I wish we had that type of pressure in the states.  Location couldn't be beat, two block walk to the tube which takes you everywhere in London. Just an FYI. Also remember to use black cabs vs Uber in London. The black cab drivers have to spend on average 3-4 years studying the areas of London before taking ""the…"
September 2016,Second time ,Second time at 41 and it was just as lovely and service just as attentive   Lots of little touches that make your stay special   Personal unhurried service and calming surroundings   A quality stay and we look forward to a third stay soon 
September 2016,Immaculate Service!!,"From the moment we entered Hotel 41, we were warmly greeted by the hotel staff who are all top notch and will go above & beyond to make sure your stay is nothing less than perfect. Great location. The hotel is located within a short walk of most of the top sights in London. The gem of the hotel is the executive lounge which is great for breakfast, afternoon tea, and drinks in the evening. The lounge has a wide array of food & drinks that are readily available to all guests and are constantly being interchanged throughout the day. The desert selection at night was our personal favorite. Would highly recommend to anyone and we will surely being looking to stay with Hotel 41 again on our next trip to London."
September 2016,Mrs 30th,"Lovely hotel can't fault it, yes it's expensive but worth it, the only thing that annoys me is air con turned right down over night, other than that can't fault the place, when we were out they bought brownies to the room and wrote happy birthday in chocolate, amazing, rooms are very clean "
September 2016,Very special ,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for two nights as part as our trip to the UK. Before we arrived we knew it was going to be special, we received a hand written letter thanking us for our reservation and looking forward to our stay. We live in Sydney! Such a lovely lovely touch.  There is a desk downstairs where you are greeted and you are then taken upstairs via a lift to the main reception area which is also in the dining area. At first this seems a little disjointed however it is just quirky. As you check in you're warmly offered a choice of any drinks soft to a selection of chilled champagne and the service is just continues from there. It's hard to put your finger on what Hotel 41 does differently to other 5 star hotels however it is different. You just know  they've taken a note of…"
April 2016,Best Hotel Experience ever!,"This hotel is amazing.  The location is excellent, the rooms are great but truly the people made the difference.   Everyone, and I mean everyone went over and above to make you welcome.  The staff was amazing. The location is right outside Buckingham Palace and a five minute walk to Victoria station.  Fifteen minute walk to Bond and Regent street.  The breakfast was excellent, and the evening appetizers was well done.  The executive lounge was a great place to relax after a long day. Try the ginger ice cream!  This hotel is well worth it and we will be back.  Thank you for an amazing stay."
September 2016,Celebration of Husbands 60th,"For my husbands 60th I surprised my husband with a trip to London and Paris, with my sister and her bf. I researched hotels/B&Bs/rentals. I read some great reviews of Hotel 41 and booked on Booking.com. Wow!!! What a great find!  The Hotel is next to Buckingham Palace and convenient to many great areas! But, the most important thing....the Hotels Staff was beyond FANTASTIC! They started by making us feel welcome from the start...champagne anyone? When we got to our room...they had a special chocolate cake with Happy 60th Birthday on it waiting for my husband! I didn't ask them to do that....I just indicated we were coming to London to celebrate his 60th. What a wonderful surprise!My husband was floored. The rooms were fantastic and nicely appointed and clean! Spacious and…"
September 2016,"Outstanding service, facility and location.","We had a wonderful time at 41.  The hotel is a beautiful facility, the room was very comfortable, the lounge was convenient and fun but the most outstanding part of all was the excellent service from all the staff.  They really know how to make you feel at home and anticipate your every need."
September 2016,Best ever,The reviews are true. We have never had service like this before - not just excellent but so friendly and totally warm. The breakfast and complimentary food in the pantry are wonderful and everybody knows you by name. We were only there one night - how do they do that! Perfect visit for a birthday surprise. 
September 2016,A different experience ... In a good way!,"My husband and I stayed at the sister hotel (The Rubens at the Palace) which shares some staff and several walls snd (hidden) doorways. As we often do when traveling, we asked for a tour at a hotel of interest. We were graciously shown around by a charming young man (whose name escapes me) who had the most delicious Scottish accent. (Honestly, he could have been reading a grocery list and I would have been happy!)   The hotel is tiny and was fully booked, but he showed us what he could, and we liked what we saw.   The GM for this hotel is the same as The Rubens, and he and his staff have got game! It's so refreshing to see an operation that knows and cares about what they're doing."
September 2016,A breath of fresh air,"Moved here from another nearby hotel where the welcome wasn't that warm, the room was tiny and the bed uncomfortable  and was needing a lot of love and found this on a price comparison site.  What a difference   Lovely warm welcome, friendly polite staff, spacious room, lots of hot water, nice little touches in the room, a can-do attitude and a great location.   Would thoroughly recommend as it was also a very decent price. Loved it"
September 2016,"If you're looking for a hotel in London, look no further.","This was one of the best hotels I've stayed at worldwide. The location is perfect; 5 min walk to Victoria Station, Buckingham Palace and Green Park. The service is nothing short of amazing. My parents, husband and I felt right at home. My parents don't speak much English, but there's some staff that speak Spanish and those that don't are very patient. My brother occasionally stopped by (stayed at a nearby hotel) and everyone was so kind to him. The hotel is beautiful; decor very British and classic. The rooms are comfortable, skin products are placed every evening on your bed and the toiletries are top-notch. There's complimentary treats all day with yummy food. I don't eat red meat and it was good to see plenty of fish options. One advice: eggs are overpriced. Eat what you can…"
August 2016,Wow!,"My wife and I were staying over two nights in London at the conclusion of a Baltic cruise, and I wanted a nice hotel to enjoy.  Reading reviews on TripAdvisor, I selected Hotel 41.  Best decision I ever made.  This hotel is AMAZING.  Not only is the location perfect (across the street from Buckingham Palace and two blocks from Victoria Station), but the lodgings are exceptional in size and furnishing.  Our room was the largest hotel room we have experienced.  And beautifully furnished in quality fixtures and a lovely black/white palette.  The executive lounge is open 24/7 and provides complimentary snacks, along with breakfast and complimentary evening munchies.  If you want to REALLY enjoy London, include a stay at Hotel 41 on your itinerary.  And the prices are not…"
August 2016,The best hotel experience we have ever had.,"Without a doubt the experience at this hotel was amazing. Not only is the decor of hotel stunning, but the staff is undeniably the most attentive, professional, friendly, well informed staff I have ever encountered while traveling. My husband and I are a bit of what I would call hotel snobs. It is important to us to stay in nice hotels when we travel. I chose this hotel on trip advisor reviews. Specifically, one reviewer wrote, ""just book this hotel now, you won't be disappointed!"" Thank you very much to that reviewer because my experience at this hotel has made my trip to London a amazing! Starting from the door man walking up the block, seeing us exit our taxi with luggage, but due to construction, we were a small distance up the street. He escorted us into the hotel entryway,…"
July 2016,Best kept secret,"I found Hotel 41 after a lot of searching for accommodation in London and I must say I picked the perfect place! Great location, wonderfully presented, friendly and helpful staff with an amazing level of service and attention.  Part of me would like to keep it a secret but my husband and I were so wowed by it that we have been telling everybody what a wonderful hotel it is. The staff really went out of their way to look after us organising theatre tickets, train tickets, late checkouts and even access to a courtesy room on our final day.  It met and exceeded all our expectations and was well worth the money."
July 2016,Loved it!!!,"Best service, perfect rooms!! The hotel itself was beautiful, clean and welcoming. Thank you for making our stay amazing. Me and my husband will be looking forward to be back soon. Best Hotel to stay."
July 2016,Probably the best Hotel we have stayed in,"We kept looking at this Hotel before booking, partly because TripAdvisor had rated it No. 1.  We could not agree more.  Everyone was great to us & our Family.  We had Grandchildren with us, ages 10-13.  They loved the Hotel also & the Executive Lounge where there were free snacks all day!  The Staff was absolutely great & attentive.  If we are back in London, we will be back."
August 2016,Absolutely Stunning.,"When I knew I had business coming up in London I decided to extend the trip and take some extra time to explore the city with my girlfriend (who had never been to Europe.) In order to ensure she had the perfect experience I began to research various accommodations and taking recommendations from friends and colleagues. It became evident very early in the process that Hotel 41 was the perfect location.   The staff contacted us prior to arrival to ensure we would feel as comfortable in our rooms as possible. They were polite, personable and professional (which was a welcome change from feeling like ""just another guest."") Each of the staff members remembered both my name as well as my girlfriends and greeted us each day in passing and at the arrival and departure from the hotel.…"
May 2016,Never been so well looked after,"Have to admit this place was amazing, nothing short of the best place I have ever stayed in. Thank you for making our holiday so special  by looking after us with first class service  always with a smile and we hope to return one day soon. Anyone wanting to stay in London then go no further than here   😊 "
July 2016,Amazing,I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff of this hotel for the warm and care they gave me during my stay her. Rooms are clean and spacious. Its very luxury treatment and luxury style of life. So great experience that will be a memorable time for me.
August 2016,One week of pure joy,"From the time we entered the front of the hotel until the final day's departure, we felt like the staff really tried to make our stay enjoyable.  From the breakfast (which was included with our room) to the assortment of newspapers to the staff continually asking if there was anything that they could do for us, such as offer maps, directions to nearby points of interest. Believe me, there are plenty of points of interest, many within walking distance. One thing that stands out to me is the shower.  There is so much water coming from the shower it feels like someone dumping a bucket of water on your head.  It seems that the hot water comes on immediately and one does not have to wait for it to warm up.  Another thing is that the location is great.  It is only a couple of blocks…"
August 2016,Service beyond expectatoins,"I can not tell you the last time my partner and I were pampered with this amount of quality service. The minute we checked in to the minute we checked out, the service was impeccable. Classy and sophisticated. The staff was friendly, knowledgable and the best in the hospitality industry, they were there to assist at every need. The executive lounge was a treat in itself, a place to relax with a cocktail and a light snack and a place to meet new friends. Our suite accommodations were clean, tastefully decorated, as was the complete hotel. I will certainly choose Red Carnation Hotels in my future travels. As for the location, you couldn't get any closer to the Queen's Buckingham Palace, right across the street. We found it to be centrally located for our travels."
August 2016,"Still Exceptional at ""41""","It was 2 years since we had our first memorable stay at Hotel 41.  Back then we wrote about getting what you paid for...which was a very attentive staff and attention to detail and it being worth the ""splurge"" though you could easily do math to justify it not being that much more expensive than alternatives for what is included.  Today I am writing from my Hotel 41 room before we leave after a short 1 night layover prior to a longer vacation.  This update is even more positive than our 2014 visit.  After 25 years of travel, we had the misfortune of our airline not having our luggage join us on our international flight.  We were facing a 12 day vacation with nothing but the clothes on our back!  Clearly not the way to start a trip.  The 41 team didn't seem to care this was a 1…"
July 2016,An oasis of luxurious calm.,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for two nights as part of our Ruby Wedding Anniversary (40 years). From the greeting at reception to the organisation of our departure taxi, amid the chaos of local road closures, everything was perfect.  We arrived just before midday and our room was ready a few minutes after check in and a welcoming drink. We unpacked and returned to the executive lounge for some lunch including a delicious wild mushroom ravioli and  snacks.  After spending the afternoon with our daughter in Richmond and a lovely Italian dinner we returned for further snacks and ice cream before sinking into the large comfortable bed.  Breakfast was freshly cooked and very tasty with lots of choices. Pocket snacks and sweets loaded we were ready for a walk to the British Museum... we are…"
August 2016,The best hotel we've ever stayed in!,"The second you step foot through the door, you know you've made the best decision of your life to stay in this Hotel! The staff are exemplary and nothing is too much trouble (and I don't think we've been called Sir or Madam so much in our lives!).   We stayed at the Hotel as a surprise for my Husband's birthday and from the welcome champagne to the romantic turndown service (which they instead organised for us for when we arrived instead of at the end of the evening) we were totally blown away by it all.   Our room was a King room, the bed so enormous and so comfy as well as the pillows which allowed us a welcome night's sleep away from our children! It was impeccably clean and spacious. We loved the laid back atmosphere of the Executive Lounge with all the wonderful touches…"
September 2015,Nothing is a problem!,"We travel to London quite often, and we've tried many luxury hotels.  Nowhere could you find better service than at Hotel 41.  Everything was superb, but an example of the service is breakfast on our last day.  We had a cooked breakfast included in our room rate, but we needed to head for Heathrow by 6:00 a.m.  We asked if a box of rolls, fruit, etc. could be made up for us to take with us.  The staff member reminded us that we could have a cooked breakfast, but we said we didn't have time.  He asked what time we would need our breakfast and we told him we would have to eat by 5:30.  This was not a problem, he responded, as the chef arrives at 5.  He took our order.  The next day we seated ourselves in the lounge at 5:25 a.m., and exactly at 5:30 a staff member appeared with our…"
July 2016,"Best Hotel, Best Service and Best Hotel Staff Ever","We just concluded a stay of 9 days in this fine hotel. We had stayed at another Red Carnation Hotel in downtown London 6 years ago, but the #1 ranking of the 41 Hotel caused us to book at this fine hotel. We booked a junior suite, which has a main floor sitting room with TV and fireplace and an upstairs bedroom with ensuite bathroom and desk. The junior suite was simply lovely and comfortable. But, what clearly makes this hotel a #1 ranked hotel is the extremely high level of professionalism, service and friendly demeanor of all hotel staff, which were extremely helpful regarding recommendations of restaurants, tourist sites and our questions in general. Of all the hotels we have stayed in, we feel this is the highest quality staff of employees we have ever experienced. 41 Hotel…"
July 2016,BEST HOTEL EVER,great customer service. best hotel i have stayed at in london. From the amenities in the room to the executive lounge they more than exceeded my expectations. Everyone had a smile on their face and went out of their way to help make my trip the best it could be
July 2016,Absolutely amazing,"Hotel 41 was absolutely amazing. The service was top notch.  Rooms were very clean and the staff very friendly and really catered to your every need.  We arrived early in the morning and of course our room wasn't ready that early (9am), so they put us in a temporary room to be able to get cleaned up, nap, whatever while our real room was being prepared. That is what I call amazing service. No other hotel has ever done that. Food was amazing. Breakfast, snack, dinner snack--all amazing. They would also give you water on your way out for your day travels as well as snacks!  The service was impeccable. They knew you by name, which adds a personal touch. Location was perfect and there is a money exchange place about 10 minutes away that will give you THE best rate that I found…"
June 2016,Fantastic Stay!,"During the week of the French Open I had the opportunity and pleasure to stay at Hotel 41, booking two rooms for four days total. I have stayed in London four or five times over the last six years, though this was my first visit to Hotel 41. I can only say my visit was the best I have had in London. The staff was amazing from start to finish. We were made to feel welcomed the minute we walked through the door. The room was exceptionally clean and comfortable. The television remote was a bit hard to navigate, definitely a user issue. :-). Plunder the pantry? - more like plundering a gourmet meal. There was never a need to go out for dinner, the food and treats were exceptional. The seafood pie and the pistachio deserts deserve special mention. I am returning to London next year…"
July 2016,The best little gem in the world!,"I have traveled to London before, but the one place I wanted to revisit and introduce my son to Hotel 41.  I had a visit there earlier with my sister and daughter. I believe it is a place that one has to experience in order to understand how truly special it is.  It is not just a hotel. It is a place you can call home - a place to relax, a place to unwind, and a place to feel uniquely special.  The salient feature is the staff.  They are efficient in their job, caring, and personnel. I always look forward to seeing one of the managers - Florent.  He exudes warmth, passion for his job, and true interest in his guests. He always makes us feel so special and my son noticed it right away. I barely mentioned how my son't birthday was coming up in a few days and me arranged a…"
July 2016,Unique,"Simply the Best. If You want personal 24 hour service in unique envinroment, this is the Place to go. Staff is just for You and You only. Near everything You want to go in London. Just ask the Staff, they will fix everything for You.. Be relaxed and enjoy Your staying."
August 2016,A Palace across from the Palace!,"If you are looking for a hotel where you are treated like a King & Queen, you have found it here! My husband and I are returning from a 5 night stay at Hotel 41 and hands down this is the best hotel we have ever experienced. From the 5 star service, staff attentiveness, pristine cleanliness, warm hospitality, and exceptional experience you are looking for Hotel 41 is the Palace across from the Palace. The afternoon tea, evening happy hours, and Belgian waffles at breakfast were an added touch. Just be prepared to make your hotel stay an annual trip, you won't want to leave."
August 2016,Amazing from start to finish,"My husband and I booked the 'Night to remember' package in honour of our wedding anniversary and birthdays as a romantic break. From the moment we were sat down in the executive lounge with a glass of champagne to register, until we were loaded up with water, sweets and an extra cake to take home and share with our young children when we checked out, the hotel exceeded every expectation.   This hotel has managed hit the nail on the head in every single area. The rooms and lounge are decorated beautifully without being ostentatious, the atmosphere is relaxed even you know you are staying somewhere really special and the staff are extremely attentive without being intrusive. The food in the plunder the pantry was absolutely wonderful, and the extras we got as part of our package…"
December 2015,Fantastic experience,Where do I start this hotel is just incredible from the luxury rooms to the attentive and friendly staff stayed here in December 2015 and wasn't sure what to expect. From the moment we arrived we felt like royalty such a beautiful place with excellent staff that couldn't do enough for us . Champagne on arrival chocolates and cards in our room we where up graded to a junior suite which was beautiful. After spending the evening out we returned to our room to find the fire lit and classical music playing slippers layed out by the bed and night cream on the pillows this place is very special. Throughout the day you can graze on canapés fruit and snacks which are fab all included with your stay we even had hot white chocolate given to us on our way out for a morning walk this hotel…
August 2016,Treated like royalty,"My husband and I are trying to remember a time we've ever been so taken care of.  We've traveled to some of the best hotels all over the world and have yet to find a place that made us feel so over the top luxurious, yet so warm; much like staying in someone's home.  The staff is phenomenal, the rooms and accommodations cozy and chic, and all the treats and food divine.  We cannot wait to return.  We find no other reason to stay anywhere else in London."
August 2016,Boutique Beauty,"If you are looking for awesome customer service, location, impressive decor you are looking in the right place. Our 3 night stay at Hotel 41 delivered all this and then some.  We had a 2 story king bed suite and it was so sophisticated.  This hotel is on the 5th floor of a building attached to another hotel and an excellent restaurant. The Executive Lounge on the 5th floor is bright and warmly decorated just as you would expect of a British living room.  The ""bbar"" restaurant next door has wonderful food, drinks and very cool decor.  Service here was just as great at next door at Hotel 41.  Another great feature is the location, right on the back side of Buckingham Palace.  Nice walking distance to some many pubs and super people watching.  Would definitely recommend this hotel…"
August 2016,"Amazing location, amazing service","If you like a full-service experience, this is your place. Wow. I've never experienced anything like it. They offer service beyond compare: want tea outside of the normal hours? Want your bags packed before you leave? Want your car brought around, gassed up? We didn't test them, but as far as I could tell, there was nothing (legal) this staff wouldn't do. They were so friendly, to us and to our kids--and so ridiculously helpful. Oh, and that afternoon tea is amazing. They even have gluten-free scones. Breakfast buffet wasn't big, but had a wide variety of things. Don't come to this hotel if you are looking for big hotel service (impersonal). This is a relatively small hotel, located on one floor of a building (with an entrance on the street level). Gorgeous interiors.…"
August 2016,THE BEST HOTEL IN LONDON,"My First impression of this hotel is the staff , they will ""WOW"" or more than ""WOW"" you!! Then when you settle in the room the ambience of the room, preparations made for you, welcome gifts, cleanliness, products & everything else in the room are just exceptional. The ""WOW"" service starts from the moment you book this hotel until you leave the hotel. The location of this hotel is very central and walking distance to everywhere. It is a definite that i will come back to this hotel as they are so call ""THE BEST IN LONDON"" in my hotel stay list. It is rather weird that i don't feel sad to leave London but i am sad to leave Hotel 41 during my departure back to Singapore. All travellers out there if you are looking for an accomodation in London this place will ""WOW"" you!    Regards,…"
August 2016,Best of the Boutique Hotels,"This was the first time we brought our teenage girls to Europe and feel Hotel 41 set a high bar for future visits.  The rooms were relatively large with beautifully appointed black and white decor.  Neither room had much of a view (we had interior courtyard rooms), which didn't matter since we were out touring during the day.  What sets this hotel apart from any other we have stayed was the SERVICE!  This hotel should be a template for every other hotel to aspire.  First, there is a front door/lobby that is always locked and requires one to be buzzed in.  It is right across the street from Buckingham palace so the area feels very safe.  The rooms are on the 5th floor, which is the top floor, so you ride the elevator up to be checked in and led to your room.  Since there are no…"
August 2016,Beyond Expectations ,"I knew from previous postings that the service at Hotel 41 was going to be superlative. What I didn't expect was that our experience would be the best three night stay we'd ever had anywhere in the world. We arrived from the US after a long, tedious flight, almost two hours in customs, and a driver from a car service who decided not to wait for us and left us stranded at the airport.  We walked into Hotel 41 tired, cranky and disheveled at about 10:00 am, and immediately everything changed. Our bags were taken for us and we were guided into the executive lounge where we were made to feel as though we were the only guests in the hotel, or at least the only ones who mattered. We were seated in comfortable chairs and immediately offered a choice of four lovely champagnes, including…"
July 2016,"Great hotel, amazing staff","It's not just the comfortable beds, soft linens, fluffy towels, excellent coffee and countless other amenities that make this a great hotel.  It's the remarkable staff.  From the moment we ""checked in"" we were treated to warm, greeting smiles.  Check in isn't what you typically experience in a hotel.  We were escorted to the 5th floor where we sat in comfortable chairs and discussed what we wanted to see and do.  Somewhere during that time a credit card imprint was taken.  We enjoyed champagne and snacks while we planned our activities.  The restaurant recommendations were spot on as was their suggestion that we tour Buckingham Palace.  The staff at the 41 truly enjoy what they do.  We'll be back."
February 2016,Just wow. Live live a star ,This hotel really has it all if you want to feel pampered. Yes it's very expensive I booked in advance and my room was still £350 for a night. However don't let the price put you off. The finishing touches are immaculate and it really feels like being on a movie set. Also the added extras like snacks and so were nice. Staff were very helpful and I didn't come across anyone unwilling to help 
August 2016,"Perfect Location, impeccable staff, incredible service.","We stayed at Hotel 41 for our 5th wedding anniversary.  We have stayed at other luxury London hotels over the years, but on this occasion we wanted to stay in a smaller more intimate luxury hotel.   This hotel is amazing !  The suites are not the size of other luxury hotels but the service more than makes up for this.  The building and rooms are beautiful and well kept.  But it is the staff and the quality of service that makes this place so memorable.  I cannot recommend this hotel enough."
August 2016,Fantastic Hotel,"41 has to be the best hotel I have ever stayed at. The staff will consistently go above and beyond to ensure you have a good stay, and are just generally pleasant. The room was fantastic, the bed was very comfortable and the decor was luxurious without being forced. I opted for the romantic turndown service for our arrival night, which helped turn an otherwise stressful day/commute into a wonderful evening. There were so many little things throughout our stay that just made the weekend perfect, I just cannot recommend this hotel enough. If you're going to stay anywhere in London, make it 41."
December 2015,Victorian,"Bit expensive, but with what you can feel and have there it is absolute cheap... character is like Victorian type..cosy furniture. Good service./.grate food... feel like you staying in a palace. go and stay there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
August 2016,Amazing intimate hotel,"I have never been pampered and catered to as I have been at Hotel 41.  I was traveling alone and they made me feel important and comfortable.  I was greeted by name from the moment I checked in.  The rooms are nice size, tea and snacks really great.   I recommend Hotel 41 without reservation.  "
August 2016,Superb hotel,"My husband and I visited Hotel 41 for 1 night for our 20th anniversary. From the minute we arrived we felt welcome and valued. It really seemed that the staff were happy if we were happy. We had a glass of champagne and some snacks in the lounge upon check-in then we were shown to our room where there was a cake and some small treats waiting for us. Everything about the room felt luxurious. Everything you could possibly need was there; from the toiletries in the bathroom to pens, paper, envelopes, stationery, 2 TV's  and so much more. We went back to the lounge for afternoon tea which was just lovely. Again, the service was impeccable. We went to a show in the evening and were asked if we needed directions, water to take, even an umbrella. When we got back there were candles lit…"
August 2016,Wonderful Hotel!,"We have just returned from 4 wonderful nights at Hotel 41. We chose the hotel purely based on Tripadvisor reviews and we are so glad we did. What a fantastic hotel! It's small just around 20 or so rooms but the service is second to non. From the moment you arrive and are offered a choice of champagnes to celebrate your arrival, the staff really can not do enough for you. Whenever we sat down in the Executive Lounge at any time of the day, immediately there is someone there ready to get you what ever you need. The lounge is a wonderful relaxing space that we enjoyed often during our stay. So tranquil you really can forget you are in the centre of a busy city.  I've stayed at many 5 star hotels but it's really the service that sets Hotel 41 apart. One afternoon Florent the…"
August 2016,The most incredible hotel!,"I chose Hotel 41 as the place to stay in London for my proposal weekend and I have to say that genuinely, I have never stayed at a hotel that delivers such exceptional service. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, everything was perfect. The room has amazing, the food available and served was incredible, the décor, the atmosphere and every single member of staff we spoke to were amazing. It is no surprise that this hotel has such a great reputation. Couldn’t fault anything during our stay and absolutely can’t wait to come back. The attentiveness and passion the staff deliver is out of this world. Thank you so much."
August 2016,Superb!,"Our first time at Hotel 41 we normally use the Savoy however on the back of Trip Adviser I thought we'd have a change for a surprise Anniversary weekend treat, I'm so glad we did. This hotel is superb but the thing that makes it above the rooms or executive lounge or the little things like a coffee or water on your way out is the staff. We cannot fault anyone they were amazing every single one! I honestly felt they were absolutely genuine and were completely interested in what you were or what you had done that day and it just makes the hotel. This is were so many other hotels fall down yes you can have the dazzling interiors etc but do you honestly feel valued every time you come in or leave?!. Simply amazing thank you Hotel 41 for a fantastic stay and we will be back!."
August 2016,Worth every penny! Best hotel I have ever stayed at...,"I have five years experience from a five star hotel, where the level of service was a huge priority. Going the extra mile was rewarded with cash bonuses! Nevertheless, I was immensely impressed by the service offered by the staff at Hotel 41. It always seemed genuine, relaxed and very proactive! Steven Jones and ??? particularly made us feel welcome, but all of the staff delivered excellent service. It is expensive to stay at Hotel 41, but I can vouch for both the food, the beverages, the rooms and the service. You get what you pay for :)"
August 2016,Undoubtedly the best,"We had been eagerly anticipating our stay at Hotel 41 due to the fact that our daughter had stayed there earlier this year and had nothing but the highest praise for the hotel and staff.  We arrived with high expectations but soon realized that those expectations would be exceeded due to the level of service provided by those that work there.  On arrival we were escorted to the 5th floor where we were quickly provided with two glasses of chilled champagne, greatly appreciated when the temperature outside was over 90F.  Check in was seamless and we were soon shown to our room. We were celebrating our silver wedding anniversary and had very kindly been upgraded to a split level suite. The suite was excellent, beautifully decorated and with every amenity you could wish for. There…"
August 2016,Consistently Outstanding ,"This particular trip was unusual in that we had a few minor problems during our stay but so well were they handled, even this  experience merely highlighted how the very high standard of customer engagement by all staff at the hotel set create the type of differentiation that capital investment in the facilities alone cannot create. Florent, one of the front of house team rains a great asset to the hotel."
August 2016,"Stellar Hotel, Stellar Staff","If you are looking for old world charm and service, this is the hotel! #1, it is gorgeous. Black and white flooring and carpet, huge leather chairs, a library which has a buffet bar with lovely finger snacks and amazing  desserts. You will be greeted and have the door opened for you by wonderful staff. You will be treated with champagne upon check-in. Your room will have a lovely fruit tray, every morning and a paper in whatever language you choose.(upon request, which they inquire about upon check-in) There was always a little gift on the bed every day, sometimes a beauty product or a candy of some sort There are candy bowls at the front desk and also water bottles you can take as you head out to see the beautiful city ofLondon. The staff is SO wonderful; they all felt like…"
July 2016,Extraordinary,"The moment you reach the door of Hotel 41 you know you are in fora luxurious experience. From the warm greetings at the door to the attentive front desk staff on check in everything went really smoothly.  Our room was gorgeous, with deep soft pillows and the comfiest mattress I have ever slept on. The Hotel is only a 5 minute walk to the nearest station and there are lots of amenities close by.  Because we had reservations elsewhere we didn't eat here."
June 2016,Sublime!,"My wife and I came to Hotel 41 with high expectations.  We have stayed at virtually every 5 star hotel in London, love several of them, and were curious how a 30 room hotel just down the street from Victoria Station could possibly wind up at the top of Trip Advisor’s list of London hotels year after year.  The answer is service and attention to detail.  Admittedly, the hotel does not have the curbside appeal of the Dorchester, Mandarin Oriental or Claridges, but once you step inside, it really delivers.  The staff knew our names almost immediately, and remembered them for our entire stay.  The Executive Lounge at the center of the hotel serves as check-in desk, bar, and restaurant, and everything they do is wonderful.  The staff will remember your drink order from the previous…"
June 2016,Best in London,I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this hotel :) the staff are brilliant! Their attention to detail is unequalled! They always look after us without us asking.  It's our home away from home always :)
September 2015,Never had this experience!,"We stayed here for 3 days and were amazed by the service, just splash out and do it. Fantastic suite with a very relaxed feel.  Lovely staff that do there very best to look after you. I can only repeat what many others feel and say. If you want to be spoilt, this is the place."
June 2016,Great nights sleep,"Sometimes you just HAVE to have that experience of a lifetime and this is it!  From the moment you walk through the door to the moment you leave; it is 5 star service all the way.  Starbucks delivered upstairs while we unpack; complimentary paper, tea, snacks in the morning, snacks in the evening, jars of candy by the front door, bottles of water.....the list just goes on and on.  The staff never seems to sleep or need it because they are always there smiling and trying to anticipate your every need.  We want to thank Stephan and his staff for a totally memorable experience-and then there was London:)"
June 2016,Suite Time at 41,A very comfortable stay with all business needs taken care of quickly and efficiently - many thanks for looking after us and ensuring that all requests and visitors were dealt with discreetly. I highly recommend room service - but be sure to ask for Damien; he was excellent.
June 2016,Perfection,"Hotel 41 in London remains one of my worldwide favorites and certainly the best in London. Two things set it apart--service and compact luxury.   The hotel is rather small, occupying only the fifth floor of 41 Buckingham Palace Road.  When you arrive, you are greeted at the main floor entrance where you will be directed to the elevator and the Executive Lounge. The library-like lounge serves as the check-in area as well as the dining room and bar. Its warm tones and upholstered furniture make it the perfect place to relax.  41 provides complimentary afternoon snacks and a late night raid-the-pantry spread in the lounge. Each time I stay, the late night snacks seem to get more varied and tastier. Thick-sliced Serrano ham, seared tuna tartar, shrimp cocktail, Stilton cheese,…"
June 2016,An Extremely Lovely Hotel,"The number of hotel beds available in London is overwhelming. I made my choice by ranking hotels (using their websites and reviews) using three parameters. Location. Inclusions (wifi, breakfast, gym). Room comfort (size, noise levels, cleanliness).  Three hotels had equal scores so then I used price to make my final choice - Only two nights, without family, this was a big event! Hotel 41. To begin - welcome emails, invitations to arrange restaurant/show bookings, and a pre-arrival information sheet to personalize my room for my arrival.  To follow - I arrived at 7.30 am after a 33 hour commute. I was greeted with such warmth and a strong coffee and nursed through to a courtesy room to use for as long as I needed however I needed. Bottles of sparkling water were pushed on me,…"
June 2016,Hotel 41,"There isn't much we can say about this lovely hotel that hasn't been stated many times by other guests.  It truly lived up to and exceeded our expectations.  We want to send a special thank you to Stefan and Patrycja who made us feel like we were staying in someone's home.  They always enquired as to how our days of sightseeing had gone and what they could do to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.  We could not have been made to feel more special.  The plunder the pantry, evening canapés and fresh fruit in our room everyday were delightful. We will definitely be staying with 41 Hotel on our next trip to London."
June 2016,Absolutely Amazing Hotel,I cannot say enough about this hotel.  The entire staff was very professional and helpful.  The lobby area is as comfortable as sitting in someone's living room.  The accommodations are excellent.  It a great location within walking distance of many attractions and also close to public transportation.  Would love to stay there again
May 2016,Unadulterated Luxury,"This is by far my favorite hotel. My husband and I first stayed 2001 and my last visit in May was just as enjoyable. The staff is so wonderful and genuinely pleasant.  They go out of their way to see that your stay is the best possible. I have stayed in many hotels around the world and I am always drawn back to 41. This is a different hotel style. Some people prefer the large hotels but this is more like a club floor feeling, which I prefer.  Food and beverage selections are outstanding. I loved just relaxing in the lounge area and chatting with the staff. The rooms are perfect for my needs. My favorite room looks out toward the royal mews.  Location couldn't be better.  Several times I have taken private tours (many good local tour companies) but also used the hop on hop off…"
May 2016,Luxury all the way,"The hotel is very luxury with a lot of important details to be in perfect condition in comparison with other good hotels, were we have stayed. They take care of everything so much that you feel that you have to do while youa re there. It is a nice place to visit at least once when visiting London, as the price was quite, although we stayed only two days."
July 2016,Prepare to be stunned!,"Prepare to be stunned indeed, as soon as you enter this extraordinary hotel you will get the wow factor straight away.  Very near Buckingham Palace you yourself feel like royalty in these grand surroundings."
July 2016,Live like a Queen,"Hotel 41 will impress from the moment you are greeted at the door. Stayed here for two amazing nights in London. Make sure you put some time aside to enjoy the executive lounge. The room was perfect, can not fault the hotel and all the staff. Made my stay in London fabulous. Great Location. 8 minutes to the nearest train station. Hop on/off bus stop directly outside hotel. 30 min very easy walk to some great sites. If you have a special occasion or just want to splash some hotel 41 will not disappoint."
August 2016,Welcomed back like old friends,"If you ever need to feel special and have an amazing couple of days away , look no further than hotel 41, set next to Buckingham Palace , in the centre of London , the moment you walk through the doors you are treated and made to feel like a member of the royal family ,   Nothing is too much trouble and from the room cleaners through to the management of Lauren you could never bet made feel more special ,  Steve in charge of the daytime drinks etc is a star explaining how and what goes into your cocktail or letting you know where to eat and drink or socialise in the city,   Thanks again and we will definitely be back ."
August 2016,Wonderful Boutique Hotel,"41 Hotel is right behind Buckingham Palace and it is well situated for walking to any location in Central London. The hotel is small and intimate. As such the staff know you from when you step inside the small lobby. All rooms are on the same floor with a hub called ""The Executive Lounge"". This is the where breakfast is taken, and drinks, snacks are constantly available. The concierge staff are truely wonderful to deal with. Restaurant or tour reservations were made with aplomb."
August 2016,Anniversary delight,"My husband and I spent our 11th anniversary here, while watching the cricket at the Oval.  It was a wonderful stay.  The rooms are spacious and clean, complimentary snacks in the lounge and the staff were second-to-none.  They were highly attentive: addressing us by name, asking about the match, and couldn't do enough for us.  Despite being hard-working, they also took the time to chat and make us feel welcome.  Plenty of friendly banter with Andrew in particular! We would love to come back again soon."
July 2016,Outstanding....,As friends were getting married in London we decided to make a long weekend of it. We spent ages looking at hotels and kept coming back to 41. Not cheap but amazing reviews and ideally located. So we decided on 41. Boy are we glad we did. Absolutely amazing service from the minute you arrive until even after you have checked out. After a short flight down from Edinburgh and a hot trip on the Tube from City Airport we were warmly met at the front door by the concierge who was expecting us and welcomed us by name. Great start which got even better. Left our bags which later appeared in our room. We were shown up to reception where the first question was.... white or rose champagne - bliss.  Our room was even better than we had anticipated. On the first night our room was turned…
July 2016,A London Jewelbox,"The Hotel 41 in London is a small hotel with the ambience of a private club.  The staff create an atmosphere that is welcoming (starting with a glass of exceptional champagne at reception), friendly, unobtrusive and consistently helpful in every way.  The goal is to exceed guests expectations and that was accomplished repeatedly during our five night stay.  For anyone looking for something special in London, this is it."
July 2016,Anaphylactic Egg Allergy ,"Quite simply, this is the greatest accommodation we've ever had. The hotel itself is beautiful, wonderful rooms, exceptionally clean, amazing location, etc, etc. However, what makes 41 truly amazing is its staff.   The people that work here are the most warm and welcoming people we've ever come across. Every single member of the team from the front door, to reception, to food and bar staff or cleaning staff - all the same - kind, professional, wonderful people. In particular, Florent, was our contact with the hotel for months prior to our trip and was accommodating to our every need. My wife and I were traveling with our 1.5 year old daughter, Hunter, who has an anaphylactic allergy to egg. When we mentioned this to Florent before our arrival, he personally took it upon himself…"
June 2016,40th wedding anniversary treat,"What a wonderful unique experience. All hotels should be like this. Most can only dream......  First of all, the ultimate in civilised champagne check in 'event' (made to feel as important as if signing an Act of Parliament!) and accompanying delicious food attended by smartly dressed staff.  Room immaculate with great showers. So quiet given that you're in the heart of London.  Stayed for 2 nights and took advantage of the sumptuous buffet for our evening meals. Just like having a 3/4 course meal in a smart restaurant.  As good a hotel (if not better) as we've ever stayed in. Can't compliment the staff enough. Lovely to see people really enjoying being at work. This has been a real treat.  Thank you."
July 2016,Top class,"What a wonderful place. If you want excellent personal service where nothing is too much trouble balanced with a genuine warm welcome this is the one for you. Extremely comfortable rooms, fantastic executive lounge, superb quality food and drinks and that personal touch. Perfect."
July 2016,There are not enough words...,"You know how you read reviews on Tripadvisor that eulogise somewhere, and you think ""yeah, right, it can't be that good"". Well. When people praise Hotel 41 to the heavens, tell you the staff seem to be mind readers as they meet needs you didn't even know you had, little personal touches and surprises just for you, the friendly professionalism of every single member of staff, the plundering the pantry - oh my.  Hotel 41 exceeded my very high expectations by some distance.  We love staying in 5 star hotels, but this small, intimate, luxurious, comfortable and welcoming hotel beats them all.  Whoever is in charge of choosing staff and then training them: bravo!  I cannot wait to return. "
July 2016,Luxury with Superior Friendly Service,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for two nights.  From the moment we arrived, the staff was so friendly and welcoming.  We were greeted downstairs and then escorted to the executive lounge for champagne and check-in.  Our room had been upgraded to a junior suite, and we found welcome sweet treats and a personal note.  We had asked about the train strikes as we were going to use the Gatwick Express to the airport, and they kept us apprised of the situation.  Breakfast was very nice.  Full English was included with our room, but we just opted for the continental each day.  I wish we would have had more time to spend at the hotel to take advantage of all the wonderful treats/snacks they provide throughout the day in the executive lounge.  They even have an ice cream freezer!  The location is…"
July 2016,You can't ask for more,"Hotel 41 is by far the best hotel I've ever visited. The staff is amazing. Everyone knew our names and what we had done that day, even if we had never met them before. They offered suggestions for fun things to do during our trip. They got us multiple restaurant reservations at great places as well as fantastic Wimbledon tickets. They did everything in their power to make sure we had a great trip. Will definitely stay here again when I come back to London, because after staying here, there is nowhere better. Special thanks to Andrew, Mitch, Cyprian, Lauren, and everyone else! Y'all are the best!"
July 2016,Game changer! ,"We have just spent the most perfect two nights at Hotel 41. From the moment you step out of the cab the whole experience is amazing. The staff are truly unbelievable, friendly, helpful, engaging and will go the extra 100 miles for you. We were made to feel really special for the whole stay and this is an experience we will never forget. We were treated to the master suite with an incredible glass ceiling, lounge area and dressing room. Unbelievable! The hotel lounge area is like being in a cosy, seriously well decorated livingroom and the pantry is like a dream! We had an amazing few days exploring the city and found ourselves really looking forward to going ""home"" as we called it! This is what this place is like...a home away from home. Perhaps we will sell up and move into…"
July 2016,A True Gem especially for people who love quiet,"We prefer staying at boutique hotels and this one is the epitome. The staff is exceptional. It was the best choice we could have made.  The bed was so comfortable and the bathroom was spotless and beautifully white.  Florent (Flo) helped us with reservations including Alain Ducasse. He was a valuable asset to us on our London leg of the trip.  The best part of this hotel is stepping off the busy, energized and loud London Street into this beautifully quiet cocoon. "
July 2016,There and Back Again..... with trophies!,"After a gap of several months while recovering from my surgery, we happily entered the portals of 41 to a warm welcome home.  We stayed in a delightful room with easy access for (my temporary) disability, sitting area and a bathroom with low (for wheelchair) fittings, walk-in shower and adjustable support rails for the loo.  We were not going anywhere on this visit.  We just needed to be pampered and that is exactly what happened, as always.  Our arrival champagne was to hand, and we had a short rest in the bedroom before emerging to join residents in the Executive Lounge for evening drinks and canapes, which were delicious.  An extended chat with long-standing friend Stefan, and a visit from the GM, Malcolm Hendry ensued, and then we chose items from the complimentary Raid the…"
July 2016,A fantastic place to stay!,"Or room (a suite) was just wonderful and relaxing, the location is great, and the staff was the best!  The lounge is a great place to have afternoon tea, or dinner and was great for prepping to go out!"
August 2015,Worth the splurge!  Can’t wait to return,"We had an absolutely wonderful one-night stay at 41 at the end of our 2 week UK vacation.   My husband and I have demanding jobs and are rarely able to take time away, so when we vacation, we really like to splurge on relaxing experiences.  We felt so pampered from the minute that we entered 41!  We knew from the hotel description that this would be wonderful, but we were really extremely impressed with the whole experience.  The entire staff at this hotel are extremely warm and friendly – genuinely so, and not just putting on a show.  You are greeted by name by all the staff, and I was amazed that they all remembered details of our conversations, and would ask how we enjoyed the activities or meals that we experienced during our stay.  We were offered a glass of champagne on…"
July 2016,Hidden gem,"Great place to stay with fabulous service. The luxury starts from the moment you arrive with a lovely welcome. Special mention to the lovely Andrew and his brilliant conversation, made us feel at home. Afternoon tea was a scrumptuous delight and the lounge was a great place to relax. All the staff that we met were brilliant and made us feel at home. Highly recommended "
July 2016,Best Service and Staff Ever!,"We stayed here a couple of weeks ago for a week, because my husbands' bucket list was Wimbledon. The staff here was the best ever from any hotel we have ever stayed at. We have stayed at many Four Season's resorts and have to say that the staff here was even better. Adele and Stefan and Florent went so far above and beyond any expectations. The breakfast with Stefan was always the best and his personality was so refreshing every morning. He always had great advice for us. For dinner Adele and Florent and the rest of the front desk staff was always so happy to help us and what we wanted. They always had great recommendations for us. We loved staying there. The food was always the best. I loved the breakfast tea and the tea any time of the day. From now on anytime we go to London,…"
June 2016,An outstanding experience,Hotel 41 is one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at.  The staff were very gracious and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable.  The location was very centrally located.  I would almost go so far as to say that it was worthwhile to visit London just to stay at the Hotel 41.  Thank you for a wonderful stay.
June 2016,"Lush, plush and totally wonderful","I've stayed in many hotels, world wide, in my life but Hotel 41 was by far the nicest experience ever. It was obvious the staff really enjoyed their jobs and that enthusiasm showed in their pleasant attitudes, whether it was early morning or late at night. The attention to detail was fantastic... but best of all... BEST of ALL... were the Lindt lindors you could have all through the afternoon and night! My favourite chocolate ever! Oh yes... if you love quality, good service and chocolate, then this is the place for you!"
June 2016,Fantastic place to stay while exploring London,"It was our first trip to London so after reading the rave reviews of others we went for Hotel 41 - wow. It was perfectly situated near Victoria station, and I can only echo every other reviewer in our praise for the staff and hotel itself. We will be trying to perfect the signature pre dinner toasted sandwich snack until we are lucky enough to return. The staff were great at recommending things to do and places to eat. Tip - absolutely book tickets to the Book of Mormon while in London, amazing show. We will see you again next year! "
July 2016,Best Hotel Ever!,"We needed a hotel near Buckingham Palace as we had been invited by the Queen in recognition of winning the Queen’s Award for Enterprise. Being top of Trip Advisor, I was highly delighted to discover that Hotel 41 was within 5 minutes of the Palace.  I was a bit worried that it might be a bit pretentious, but thought we deserved a special treat and it sounded wonderful. I must say, that I have never stayed in a hotel like this ever and it was wonderful. Not pretentious at all.  The staff are wonderful; they all know/remember your name.  Nothing is too much trouble.  I am gluten free and my husband is dairy free, I advised them of this before we arrived and I didn’t need to say again, all the staff knew and remembered.  I have never experienced that before.    We had a lovely…"
July 2016,The best there is...,"I am a Ritz girl and believe it or not this is better than the Ritz or any other hotel I have ever stayed at . The food is five star and so is the service. I wish there were a Hotel 41 in every city I visited. I wish I could live here. The location is very convenient , near the Victoria Station."
June 2016,Better service than Buckingham Palace.....,"If you wish to feel like Lord and Lady Grantham, then this is the place for you. Service from another era. Highly recommended.   The gold standard of service and responsiveness against which every other hotel will be judged. Simply could not have been better.   They quietly go about trying to accommodate every wish and whim almost without you realizing it. My wife ordered bacon and got something that looked more like ham (British style bacon.) Before we knew it a quiet concierge had googled bacon and realized there are actually four kinds, British, Streaky, American and Canadian. They promptly brought out American style bacon.   Stephan Otto felt like my personal friend and butler for our one week stay.   I could go on. For the penultimate service experience go to the 41."
June 2016,Impeccable Service!,"Hotel 41 was definitely on of the top hotels on our list.We The hotel is elegant without being stuffy, extremely clean ( and I'm very picky!) and the staff is incredibly accommodating and engaging. We were surprised on our first night upon returning to our room, with candlelight, rose petals, chocolate covered strawberries and champagne in a bucket! Fabulous hotel!!!"
June 2016,Still the best in London,"We made two visits here is June (before and after a week elsewhere in europe) and they are just as fabulous as ever.    The staff is outstanding, helpful in everyway, even in things you could not have thought you needed.  They anticpate every possible need and do such a great job of making you feel at home in this hotel.    The rooms are lovely, comfortable and luxurious throughout.  Breakfast is wonderful -- snacks and canapes in the lounge are decadent!  I always love the relaxing beverage in the lounge after a long day.. and it just feels like home away from home.  thank you for all that you do every time we stay!  We wouldn't stay anywhere else in London."
June 2016,Best Service,"The Best service I have ever experienced, with no One of. I know many people were impressed by Hotel 41's warm, careful, detailed service, So am I throughout our stay. The greatest part happened when our trip ended, we found my whole bunch of keys were left behind in hotel room after 13-hours flight back home, it was a disaster..We call the hotel then received a message that the concierge who saw our keys left on desk put it into one of my stored luggage, and we found it there. You can image how grateful I was."
June 2016,As great as everyone says!!,"My husband and I stayed four nights during our visit to London.  I can't add much to what everyone else has said except that it is all true!!  We loved everything about it.  The only thing I will say is don't let the ""fanciness"" of the hotel intimidate you.  My husband and I are regular, middle-class people who indulged in 41 as a special treat.  I had been worried that we weren't ""classy"" enough to stay here.  I was wrong.  For one thing, what I saw of the other guests suggested that most of them were also regular folks having a special experience.  And the other thing is that the staff is so professional and friendly that they made us feel totally at home and comfortable.  So just do it--you'll be glad you did!!!"
May 2016,Hotel 41 London,"Home away from home. But better. The level of customer service is unsurpassed. Our every need was anticipated and prepared for before requested. In fact, I didn't have to request anything. Everything I could have wanted was presented to me with a smile. I've stayed in many luxury hotels, but Florent, Magda and team at 41 went above and beyond to make the stay exceptional. The stay at 41 was actually part of the London experience and is a destination experience in itself. You and your children will be so spoiled, you'll wish the team could train every hotel's staff around the world."
June 2016,A wonderful stay,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel 41 on 11th June to mark the occasion of our 45th wedding anniversary. If you want modern ""old fashioned"" elegance combined with astonishing levels of service and attention to detail then this is the place to stay. A fantastic experience"
December 2015,17th Wedding anniversary ,"Where do I start? We stayed here 26th December 2015-1st Jan 2016 to celebrate our 17th wedding anniversary. With the help of  Florent, I was able to pull off a total surprise for my husband, it was perfect! We had dinners planned, a trip  to Paris, a visit to the shard, Christmas lights at Kew garden, a football game attended, New Year's Eve celebration watching the fireworks down at the eye. Everything was simply amazing! From the moment we were picked up at the airport, till the moment we had to sadly say goodbye, Everything and everyone were perfect. I could not have wished for a better place to celebrate our wedding anniversary and surprise for my husband. The staff were amazing. The rooms we stayed in were amazing. The fire was lit on an evening, with candles around the…"
June 2016,A hidden Jewel by Buckingham Palace,"Even before we arrived our experience began. An email asking pillow preferences, was there anything we specifically wanted or needed?, meant we had already been able to personalise our stay before arriving.From the minute we arrived the welcome was genuine and the service exemplary. The welcome champagne was beautifully presented and explained and the check in process a pleasure. As a family we had asked for connecting rooms. What we got was perfect. The 2 rooms had a main entrance to the corridor area and as such we could have both the room doors ajar in complete safety. The rooms were beautifully decorated and equipped. It was our 25th wedding anniversary and had requested the romantic turn-down. Candles, rose petals , champagne and other treats were provided whilst we were…"
June 2016,EXCELLENT HOTEL - ALWAYS THE SAME HIGH STANDARDS,"This is the fourth time we have visited this hotel - absolutely love it.  This is a small hotel with fantastic staff who couldn't be more courteous and helpful.  I love the executive lounge, I love the service, I love the hotel and we will certainly return."
June 2016,luxury,"I think one of the best hotel I visited. My room was comfortable, clean, no noise.. Staff very kind! the price is not so cheap but if you want to stay in the best hotel in London.. you have to spent.. I'll be back!!!"
July 2016,Nothing to Improve Upon,"I spent a week at Hotel 41 for vacation and had a magnificent time. Everyone I encountered seemed truly pleased to work there and took great pride in making me feel welcome and accommodated. The staff immediately knew my name and quickly learned my favorite beverage, without being overly-solicitous. The hotel is small but luxurious. My room had a sitting area that was quite comfortable. Breakfast was included so I ate there each morning- never-mind the menu, just ask for what you want and it appears. The lounge area has the feel of a mansion library- wood paneling and elegant furnishings. There are complimentary snacks presented throughout the day culminating in ""plunder the pantry"" which is perfect if you are not up for a heavy supper. Because the hotel is small you see the…"
July 2016,Worth Every Single Penny,"We spent three weeks in Europe, staying at some of the best hotels; All three nights at Hotel 41 was perfect and the highlight of our trip! Apparently 41 is the equivalent of the concierge floor for the adjoining Ruben Hotel, taking up the building's 5th floor with a private entrance on the 1st floor.  The Ruben has rooms on floors 2-4 below the Hotel 41 rooms. The rooms are VERY comfortable, well appointed, and have all the amenities one expects from a fine luxury hotel, although as a comment to management, I would upgrade the quality of the Wifi internet service in this high bandwidth digital age. One of our rooms was the split level conservatory suite which was a gorgeous and unique experience. What distinguishes this hotel from most other luxury hotels was their very…"
June 2016,Best hotel in London,We stayed here for 3 days during our visit to London. We loved everything about it. The stay at 41 was actually part of the London experience and was a destination experience in itself. From the minute we arrived the welcome was genuine and the service exemplary. The welcome champagne was beautifully presented and explained and the check in process a pleasure.  What we got was perfect.  The rooms were beautifully decorated and equipped. This was a small hotel with fantastic staff and excellent service. We didn't want to leave and will certainly return!
June 2016,Hotel 41 is like no other!,"My husband booked our 4 night stay at this hotel through Costco travel.  He booked it and then told me about how special this hotel was going to be for us and our stay in London.  He told me it's just around the corner from Buckingham Palace.  I trusted him and thought, ""right, just around the corner!"" ...well, he was right on both, Hotel 41 was a pleasure and a dream to stay with and Buckingham Palace, the front, is right around the corner.                                                                                                                              Because I had never experienced hotel service like this before, initially I didn't quite understand why we had interaction with 6 hotel staff persons from the moment we first walked into the hotel to the hotel desk and…"
July 2016,A delight,"Ideal location, beautiful hotel, gorgeous room, comfy bed - but it was the whole team of staff who took it to the next level.   Their service and attention to detail is absolutely spot on.  We have stayed in hundreds of hotels, but this is by far the best hotel experience we have had.  Perfect!"
July 2016,A very Special Place to Stay,"I've stayed at Hotel 41 twice now. The first time while on business was such a great experience I had to stay with my wife when we visited London for pleasure.  On this visit we stayed for two nights so that we could attend Wimbledon.  Our welcome was superb. Greeted on the ground floor and directed up to reception where check in had just the right level of formality - a glass of champagne on arrival is also a treat. Having Champagne flow throughout our stay was even better.  Our room was quirky with a lounge with a staircase up to our bedroom.  The bedroom was sumptuous. The bed big, deep and comfortable with great linen. The bathroom was well appointed.  The staff were all attentive, friendly and the service exceptionally good.  The plunder the pantry concept is tremendous.…"
July 2016,24-hr. executive lounge and order- off- the menu breakfasts,5 minutes from victoria station subway stop.  Large well-appointed room.  Sumptuous breakfasts.  Exceptional service from a genuinely friendly staff.  Champagne available 24-hrs. a day.  I would go back without question.  This is the best hotel I have ever stayed in.
January 2016,There is a reason . . .,"this hotel is the finest hotel I have ever stayed at -- service, service, service. When my wife returned, we planned a trip to London and Paris -- no expense was spared.  Even after 4 years, she still talks about her stay at the 41.  From ""raiding the pantry"" to an afternoon reading and sipping Veuve Clicquot in their library.  Truly a one of a kind experience.  Chapeau 41!"
May 2016,Couldn't recommend enough!,We stayed here over the May Bank Holiday weekend and my husband had booked it as a surprise for my 40th. The service and welcome you receive is unparalleled and we were treated as if we were the most important guests in the hotel (I am sure every other guest felt the same). They even left a birthday cake in our room as a surprise - such attention to detail is hard to find and I would urge anyone looking to book a special trip to book Hotel 41.
March 2016,fit for a queen (or king),"stayed many place in london since 1963--including four seasons--and this tops them all.  hotel ruebens , next door, added a fifth floor, private entrance boutique hotel. we spent a week with our children and grandchildren. it was a real priviledge. adjacent to st. james park, across from buckingham palace, around the corner from #10 downing street--the location was ideal. away from the noise and bustle , but easily accessible anywhere--either through victoria station, always available taxi, or by foot."
March 2016,BEST SERVICE EVER,We spent four nights at Hotel 41 and wished it could have been longer.  Superior service.  The staff remembered our names from day to day and even our preference of drink in the evening.  Everyone there was friendly and helpful.  They truly tried to meet your every need. It is located near Buckingham Palace.
April 2016,Excellent service and beautiful hotel.,"We have just returned from a stay at Hotel 41 and we still haven't stopped talking about it. From the moment we walked in, we thought we were too early to check in and just wanted to drop our bags off, the staff could not do enough for us. A glass of champagne appeared along with a tray of nibbles. By the time we had finished our champagne our room was ready. The room was lovely and had everything in that you could possible need. Lovely toiletries and lots of them. We would like to say a big thank you to Steve Jones , who made sure we had everything we wanted and did so in a really friendly manner. The breakfast , late lunch and all of the ""pantry"" food we ate there was delicious. We are now planning when to return."
April 2016,Only visited!,"I actually only visited this hotel, meeting friends who were staying there. What a gem of a place, I can't believe I have never stayed there. The welcoming feel, staff so attentive ( even thou I was just a visitor). I will defiantly be using this hotel in the future. First rate  class hotel in the heart of London. I look forward to booking soon."
April 2016,Pretty amazing...,"if you've ever visited a stately home or watched something like Downton Abbey and wondered what it was like to live like that - I'm pretty sure a stay at Hotel 41 will give you an idea.  The place is beautiful - the lobby, the corridors, the Lounge and the bedrooms are all decorated to a very high standard.  The level of staff attentiveness is extremely high - whilst everyone was lovely we had more interaction with Andrew, Michael and Steve who were very nice guys.  Whilst reading TripAdvisor reviews indicates that this place is as close to perfection as it is possible to get, there are a few things to bear in mind.   Whilst there is the ability to nibble away to one's hearts content, in actual practice we didn't use this to any great extent - all we had we had from the…"
April 2016,A gem in the heart of London,"Hotel 41 is absolute Gem of a hotel in the heart of London. I can only agree with all previous reviews that have rated this hotel with 5 stars. We stayed just for one night on my wife’s birthday and she was presented with a lovely birthday cake upon arrival in our room, along with our welcome glass of champagne at check-in. Its proximity to Victoria station is ideal especially as a forerunner to any Orient Express or British Pullman trips as you will sample absolute luxury and great service even before you get on the trains! The staff, amenities and ambiance are first class, sadly we didn’t have sufficient time in the hotel during our stay. Next time, and there certainly will be a next time, we will make more time available just to enjoy the hotel! "
April 2016,Magnificent & fabulous stay! Best hotel in England!,"Initially, I picked Hotel 41 due to it's convenient location! But as soon as we arrived at Hotel 41, my son (7 year old) and I feel in love with the hotel straight away - home away home!  The staff was so welcoming and caring towards my son and me (travelling alone). And even organised a complimentary private tour with one of the managers - Andrew- to take us around Buckingham Palace, Green Park and St. James's Park. Again, the next morning took my son to Green Park to play football.  For the rest of the 2 days stay, the hotel staff organised our tours and activities: chauffeur city tour, Musical Concert tickets, London Eye Fast Track ticket and restaurant bookings!  We were spoilt, but at the same time felt very well taken care at a cosmopolitan busy city. Every staff at Hotel…"
January 2016,Faultless perfection,"From start to finish we were looked after and pampered.   This is a small hotel but luxurious, without a doubt.  It should be noted that even the black cabs do not know every hotel in London, so do not be deterred if your taxi driver doesn't know it.  Just ask for The Rubens hotel and then go through the next door lobby, clearly signed for Hotel 41. Welcomed with champagne we decided to sit by the fire in the lounge before heading to our room.  Very restful.  Attended to for any requirements but not smothered.  Once we headed to our room we found our case inside, as promised when it was taken from us at the downstairs lobby reception (before we were escorted to the check in reception).  A bottle of wine was on ice, also as promised.  The bathroom, mini bar and wardrobe were all…"
April 2016,A fantastic hotel!,"This is a really great boutique hotel in the heart of London. The amenities are wonderful, and the staff was so accommodating and nice it was like they were old friends. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. I highly recommend Hotel 41."
April 2016,Absolutely perfect in every way!,"All I can say about this hotel is Wow! We booked the hotel to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary and our stay couldn't have been more perfect! From the minute we arrived and gave our name to the lady at the door to the moment left we felt so relaxed and comfortable at the hotel. The staff are all so friendly and it would be unfair to single anyone out, they all knew who we were and the personal touch is fantastic. The executive lounge is such a lovely place to relax and enjoy a drink and the amazing array of complimentary food throughout the day is superb. We were blown away when we arrived back from our meal and the staff had decorated our room with petals and candles for our anniversary, it was such a lovely personal touch that continued the next morning when we were given…"
May 2016,Amazing! Just amazing! ,"Me and my wife came to London for our week holiday and this hotel was recommended to us by a friend. It doesn't make you feel at home, it makes you feel like you don't ever want to return there! Prices are more than reasonable for a room with this kind of quality, always bright and welcoming. The staff makes it all the better. We had an amazing time in this place. It made our holiday so much better. A must go! "
May 2016,Exceptional stay,"Hotel 41 truly is amazing.  It is a lovely boutique hotel with elegant rooms, wonderful linens, outstanding amenities, and the best executive lounge I have ever experienced.  I would have been pleased with just this, but Hotel 41 is so much more as well.  It really did feel like the entire staff wanted to make our stay truly remarkable--and they did not fail!  The staff go out of their way to provide their guests with the highest level of service; nothing is too much trouble.  We asked them to acquire a SIM card for us and it was waiting for us on our arrival--so nice that we didn't need to search out a 3 Store on our own.  Every time we came back to the hotel we were greeted by name.  The breakfasts were delicious. I looked forward to them every morning.  Afternoon tea was…"
May 2016,Magical,"We have stayed in many 5 star hotels across the world, but this little gem in London is by far the best.  From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave (begrudgingly) you are treated like the most important guest they have staying with them.  Our 2 night stay was for the Queens garden party and there were a few things we needed in preparation. My husband wanted a pink buttonhole and a wet shave on the day of the garden party. Not a problem. An appointment was booked for him at Trumpers in Mayfair (along with transport) and his buttonhole was delivered in pristine condition ready for us to leave. Nothing is too much trouble.  The executive lounge is the heart of the hotel and an absolute treat. Stefan and his wonderful stories are not to be missed and he along with all of…"
May 2016,Faultless,"I have never been so enamoured by a hotel. Everything about this hotel was perfect from start to finish. I would love to give feedback for what they could do better next time or went wrong but unfortunately or fortunately depending on how you look at it, I have nothing to say. You will not regret staying here. I will rave about this hotel for a long long time. Staff are pure professional excellence. Every hotel manager from all the hotels I have ever visited need to stay here to understand what 5 star truly means."
September 2015,heaven on earth!,the loveliest  location and  the best service along with finest amenities....It makes for a dream holiday stay. The rooms are well equipped and the bathrooms luxurious.  The central space  serves wonderful breakfast and great cocktails in evening
June 2015,Exceptional stay!,Everything about this hotel is brilliant. The location is perfect across from the Mews and allows for easy access to central London. The service here was truly one of a kind and they did everything they could to ensure every aspect of our stay was the best. The penthouse room is a DREAM!! The glass ceiling both day and night is like nothing you will find again! We cannot wait to go back again! Thank you for making our anniversary stay the best! Side note...there is a lovely Sri Lankan restaurant right around the corner! So good!
May 2016,41 is Number 1. All staff take a bow,"We first stayed here 10 years ago. It was super then and is super now.  This really is a fantastic hotel, with the best team of staff that I have ever come across in any organisation. They really were something from a by-gone era when Britain was renowned for it's service. There were absolutely no ""weak links"", so it would be unfair to single out any individual. I would suggest that the Employee of the Month Award would go to the Team.  Sumptuous surroundings, every last detail taken care of. Everyone went out of their way to make me and my wife feel so very special.  What a shame we could only stay for 1 night as we had to be home for my Mother's 95th birthday. We were down in London for a visit to a Buckingham Palace Garden Party and, although we were catching the train on the…"
May 2016,Home from Home,"The staff and service at Hotel 41 is what makes the stay so enjoyable. As the hotel is quite small all the staff know your name, they remember your plans and then are keen to ensure that you had a good time. Our room was quite small but it had everything you could possibly want and need. The beds are huge and extremely comfortable. The shower was the best power shower I have ever been in! The executive living/dining room is just like a very comfortable, well appointed front room - with free ice cream, hot and cold snacks and a great selection of alcohol available. The service is friendly and unfussy. Location-wise the hotel gets full marks as well, being just 20 mins walk from Piccadilly Circus and 10 minutes from Kensington & Chelsea - and the Queen as your near neighbour! We…"
May 2016,There is a reason,There is a reason to visit again and again and the reason is the very simple fact that this hotel has service so well worked out that you just feel like you are in the hands of a welcoming family. This was our third visit and we were no less well looked after. We had an executive King room and this was more than adequate and very well appointed. The 'pantry' is a marvel and I ate extremely well from it on the Friday night even to the extent of having a beer with my curry. I know I could have been in a curry house doing the very same but the infused service just made this all the nicer. We will be back once again later in the year. Is there anywhere else like this? It doesn't matter because this works just perfectly. 
May 2016,Simply impeccable!,"My husband, daughter, and I stayed for 3 nights at Hotel 41 last week.  Everything about this hotel is IMPECCABLE:  service, location, food and drink, rooms, cleanliness -- I could go on and on.  We had reserved a junior suite but were thrilled to be upgraded to the Balmoral Suite upon arrival.   We received a warm welcome from Adele at check-in where we were provided complimentary glasses of champagne while waiting.  She also graciously made dinner reservations at Café Murano for us while we were checking in.  Our suite was spotlessly clean, beautifully laid out, and supplied with best-in-class amenities.  Even the smallest detail - like a really good hairdryer! - was top-notch.  I can't say enough about the staff.  They are completely professional but so charming and friendly.…"
February 2016,Nearly perfect,"One of the nicest hotels I've had the pleasure of staying at. Staff could not have been more helpful, including trying to find a dentist at 2am. The executive lounge was an unexpected gem. The only area that could improve was the standard of food on the dinner menu, not matching the excellence of the breakfast. would still be our number one choice of hotels in London though"
December 2015,2nd stay for new year!!,"Stayed here in November initially, then booked again to stay for 4 nights starting New Year's Eve,  just when you think it cannot get any better... It does! We arrived at the hotel to be greeted like returning friends! We got to our room to find a nice bottle of bubbly waiting, We stayed in New Year's Eve and enjoyed the flowing drinks, cocktails also. We then went up on the roof to watch the fireworks on the London eye, really nice touch. Special mention to Adele, she asked us if there was anything she could help with, I said we was thinking of visiting a spa, somewhere with a pool. 5 mins later she returned having found a perfect spa for us, she booked this and printed off directions if needed. Very fast service nothing was too much trouble for her. We bumped into Andrew also…"
February 2016,Amazing,"We picked this hotel as it was number 1 on trip advisor, and I can see why!  From the minute we arrived the staff were brilliant, checking us in with champagne and port.  They could not do enough for us.  Location is perfect easy access to the tube. Some lovely restaurants nearby. We dined at a local Italian that the hotel staff recommended and booked for us.  The bedroom had everything that we needed. The food we ordered as room service was delicious. Full English in the morning was also superb. Throughout the day and night snacks were put out, in fact by the time I went our for our evening meal I was not hungry!  Highly recommend this hotel for special treats and indulgence 😉😉"
February 2016,"Stay at Hotel 41, London","We have stayed in this hotel as couple i.e. my wife and myself , father and son football trip. On both occasion the stay was excellent. In our family we have named this hotel as home way from home. The rooms are excellent and there is value for money compare to other hotels in Europe. The staff are excellent and amazing. They always go beyond excellent customer service. Everyone seems to enjoy doing their job hence this transfer to the staff excelling in their job. The moment you walk in into this hotel you are treated like a King or Queen. I don't know how they do it but the Red Carnation group hotels  (Oyster Box, Hotel 41 and 12 Apostles )that i have stayed in  have excellent staff. The hotel location is excellent and close of UK kingdom palace. There is also cosy lounge…"
March 2016,Perfect yet again!,"I love this hotel so much! It's perfect for our annual romantic London getaway.   The service is second to none the rooms are luscious with lovely fluffy pillows (they give you a choice). Its like being in Alice in Wonderland with all the black & white decor.  My favourite part is returning after a night out, sitting in front of the fire in the executive lounge and helping myself to a cheese plate a drink from the honesty bar. It is only small so you rarely see any other guests.   I can't wait to return and it will be less than a year next time!"
February 2016,Amazing Service,"We booked this hotel due to the reviews on TripAdvisor - and wow, are we glad we did.    We were in London for three days to celebrate my 50th Birthday and the staff at the hotel did everything to be as helpful as they could.  From the moment we walked into the hotel with the welcoming chilled champagne, to the moment we were reluctantly sent on our way at the end of our stay with a hamper of goodies from the snack bar, we cannot fault the staff or the place.  The quality of everything in this hotel is fantastic - the rooms are spacious for London hotels - the location a few minutes walk from Buckingham Palace - the free snack bar a welcome change from having to pay for every morsel you consume - excellent choice of beverages all at reasonable prices for a central London 5 star…"
February 2016,Excellent! ,"Theres something to be said about good customer service and this hotel certainly has that. EVERYONE we came into contact with was very hospitable, attentive, polite and assertive.  Although its rather open plan and cosy in the main dining room (Executive Lounge) it has that certain charm and relaxing feel to It that makes you want to just wind down and enjoy the free champagne and nibbles. Hotel itself is very clean and has many nice touches and little extras. Well worth a visit, even if for a night!"
February 2016,"Honestly, amazing","This hotel is honestly amazing. The service is impeccable, friendly, relaxed. The staff truly seems to enjoy their work, and that makes is such a pleasure to be there. I'm a writer, so I usually try and avoid over-use of adjectives, but seriously, this hotel is great.  At one point, I was working in the lounge, and one of the staff got me an extension plug so I could work by the fire. I happily worked for 2 or 3 hours, while eating lovely food and drinking one of the best Rose wines I've ever had.  There was a major flood, totally unrelated to the hotel-- a water main broke on the street, and that night, the internet was down while I was trying to check into my return flight. I asked about it at the desk. Didn't really mind, as I was able to go to sleep instead of working more. …"
January 2016,A gem of gems,"In short, you feel instantly as if you are amongst friends. The staff is attentive and very service minded. Absolutely loved it. This has to be one of if not the best hotel I have stayed in of all my visits to London. The location is very close to Buckingham palace. I will return again and again"
February 2016,Simply amazing,"We stayed here over my birthday, and I can't even explain how amazing this hotel is, the hotel itself is truly luxurious and the staff are excellent! They done every thing they could to make our stay perfect without being too much! The perfect amount of attention. From the Champagne on arrival to the 'plunder in the pantry' to the room service everything exquisite! We didn't want to leave! All the extra touches to a birthday cake to a birthday card and even a little present! Everything was wonderful and we enjoyed every second! I want to thank all the staff who made our stay the best! We shall be definitely returning. "
April 2016,Unbelievable!,After visiting another Red Carnation group hotel previously we thought we knew what to expect from this visit but we were happy to be surprised way beyond our expectations. I agree with all the positive reviews and I have to say this is the best hotel I have ever been to. The check in was a delight and the champagne a lovely treat. The executive lounge and continuous snacks make it seem like a home away from home and you never go hungry! The staff were incredible and nothing was too much trouble. They were generous with their time and we never had to remember our room number or wait for anything.  The room was extremely comfortable and spacious and there were luxurious toiletries to enjoy. I can 100% recommend this hotel you will not regret your decision to stay here.
April 2016,Truly Outstanding ,"My daughter and I stayed at Hotel 41 for 5 nights this week.  First, let me say, that the quality of the staff here is unmatched.   Everyone was so helpful, friendly and always remembered our names.  Even my 13 year old daughter was impressed (no small feat!).  We loved the lounge in particular.  The location of the property is perfect.  It is central to everywhere you want to visit and very close to Victoria Station.  To give you an idea of the exclusivity of Hotel 41, even the London cabbies need help finding it!!  Side note:  Nathaniel's negroni's should be added to the permanent cocktail menu!!  Cheers.  "
March 2016,My new favourite place to stay in London,"What a find!! Smallest 5 star hotel in London I believe but big in stature and customer service. Staff are all wonderful couldn't possibly single one out. Cocktails, food and snacks  all excellent quality and plenty of them."
April 2016,Just brilliant - believe the reviews!,"This is my first ever review but our trip to Hotel 41 definitely warrants me taking the time to post a review.  We have stayed in many 5 star hotels but this hotel definitely delivers on personal friendly service.  From the moment my husband and I arrived we were greeted with warmth, friendliness and also a complimentary glass of champagne- happy days!  We had booked an Executive King room but to our surprise we were upgraded to the Conservatory Master Suite which was set over 2 levels and was gorgeous.    The Executive Lounge is quaint and very welcoming and we just had to take advantage of the complimentary afternoon tea consisting of warm scones, jam and cream.  The complimentary pantry is well stocked and we were actively encouraged to take whatever we wanted.  After drinks…"
March 2016,Wonderful anniversary stay,"This hotel is just perfect. I cannot think of a single thing that could be improved!  The staff are friendly, efficient and thoughtful but low key. We really enjoyed talking to them. My husband really connected with one of the staff, Steve Jones and thought the world of him.   The Executive Lounge where business is taken care of as well as having meals there was beautiful and so tastefully done.  It became our second home while we were there. We had most of our meals there as it was so convenient and the food was what you expect  in a higher end restaurant.   The location was really handy across from Buckingham Palace. It is a  three minute walk to Victoria station then you can go anywhere in the city on the tube. Taxis are plentiful when needed and the hotel is more than happy…"
March 2016,Perfect,"Wow!!! This hotel is absolutely perfect...where do i start? It has a very good location. And From the minute we entered we already knew that we made the right choice. The hotel is very clean and stylish. We were brought to the lounge area with free food, dessert, drinks and impeccable service from the staff. They made me feel right at home. The staff seem to have this ability to know and deliver all your needs in style and cheer. The bedroom was amazing, we didnt get a suite but the space was more than enough for all our large metal rimowa luggages and carry on luggages. It was very well decorated and the bed was very comfortable. Airconditioner was good and works even in winter i think. Television was fantastic with over 100 channels. For those that sleep in late curtains are…"
April 2016,Mr,"Expectations of a 5 star hotel is already there, hotel 41 deserves them all, environment, design, food everything is superb, but there is one thing what thous it all, The Staff!!!!! Never had such a service in my life. All of you from check in to cleaning congrats💐👊🏼 simply the best If you want a small luxury hotel stay here and I promise you, you will enjoy your stay It feels like family who wants to take care of you I will return to you!!!"
March 2016,"The best hotel in London, and the Planet.","We stayed at the 41 for 8 days, and every day things would get a little better. The staff notices what you like throughout your stay and they start doing it for you. For example, if they notice that you turn the AC on during the night. They start doing it for you.   Another thing that is great about this hotel is the service, and the people. Andrew was an excellent chap. He recommended the best restaurants which we loved. Everyone was so nice and very helpful to us.  Mr. Jones was also great to us as he bought me some Haribo sweets with his own money because he thought I would like them. Tea in the executive lounge was one of the most enjoyable things to do in London.  This hotel is not very expensive, it is small and exclusive and it has great rooms. It beats other hotels which…"
March 2016,Amazing stay for our first wedding anniversary!,"We stayed here for two nights on the 23rd March as part of our 1st wedding anniversary celebrations. I had been wanting to stay here for a while as it is no.1 on tripadvisor, and after staying, we can definitely see why it is no.1!   Like so many others have said, the service is simply outstanding. All the staff were brilliant, for example, on check in, they knew our names, loved the handwritten welcome card in the room, I had a gift for my husband delivered to the hotel directly as it would not arrived in time otherwise, and the staff had safely kept it until our arrival...they remembered what type of coffee and tea we prefer at breakfast...anytime we asked for something in our room, they delivered it so promptly...helping me locate our uber taxi as I couldn't figure out the…"
March 2016,Best Service Ever,"Recently stayed for three nights.  While the rooms are nice, what really separates this place is the service, which is the best I've ever experienced at a hotel.  The staff strikes a terrific balance of being friendly and attentive without being intrusive.  The lounge (called the Executive Room) is also a wonderful feature, much like having your own Club in London.  Will definitely stay again."
June 2016,Great Attention To Detail,The hotel has really got great attention to detail to make sure everything you need is right.  Staff are extremely friendly and courteous and make you feel very welcome.  The food bar and relaxed lounge is a real plus in the heart of busy London.
May 2016,excellent!!!!!!,"a luxury hotel with confortable modern rooms!!!! The stuff was very helpful and professionals and the location was perfect, close to the sub!The breakfast we had at the hotel was of a very high standard!! Totally perfect!!!!"
June 2016,"Stunning rooms, fantastic service and an experience you will never forget!","We stayed at Hotel 41 as part of our honeymoon in London based on the reviews we read on Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed. We were led up to the executive lounge, the main heart of the hotel. Here we were given a welcoming glass of champagne to sip on whilst the set up of the hotel was explained to us. The lounge is absolutely stunning and feels so comfortable. The hotel has complimentary snacks such as ice cream, sweets, popcorn, crisps. This changes to cheese and meats and even desserts during the evening. The hotel has an honesty bar which sums up the whole feel of the hotel. Guests are trusted to log in a book any drinks they have helped themselves to from the bar. As a guest at this hotel you really do feel at home - just a far more luxurious version of home!  As part…"
May 2016,An exceptional staff and property!,"We stayed at the Hotel 41 for 10 days on our second visit to the UK.   Our experience upon arriving at 10:00 pm to our departure 10 days later at 6:00 am was the absolute best.   The staff, from the concierge, to the executive lounge team, to the management, are amongst the finest we've experienced after traveling throughout Europe.   The staff is very attentive, helpful, engaging (personal touch which is much appreciated while traveling), knowledgeable and most important they are all very warm and genuine.    We stayed in a junior suite and was so pleased with the accommodations.  The historic details in the room, combined with a ""western"" size bathroom and amazing shower were a plus.     The Executive Lounge was open 24 hours and you had a full pantry of treats and drink…"
June 2016,"Charming team,first class accomidations","We were so fortunate to find hotel 41 for our recent trip to London. The room was luxurious,location perfect,and staff totally charming professionals . After an injury occurred they treated us like family. That is only true if your family is really good to you!! We will never stay anywhere else if they have an available room."
June 2016,Hotel that never ceases to amaze ,This is a luxury boutique hotel with rooms in a monochromatic palette. The main social area is the executive lounge.   This hotel is absolutely fabulous in every aspect. You will not regret a stay here and you will want to come back. The personalized service is utterly perfect. 
June 2016,Best in London,"We arrive in this paradise with some of my friends. The Rooms is big and comfortable, clean and with nice art decor. The staff is very help full and nice. We have our best time in London. Fantastic position, very close to the sub way and the tourist attraction. "
May 2016,Reality exceeds expectations!,"We stayed 3 nights at this hotel last week and had a wonderful stay. I picked the hotel because it was ranked #1 and our stay exceeded all expectations. The rooms were wonderfully appointed and we were surprised when we had rose petals on the bed at night without asking.   The location was a perfect base for sight seeing. And the staff was willing to go out of their way to accommodate any request you may have.   The best part of the hotel is the executive lounge. This is a beautiful room that they keep stocked 24/7 with free (and delicious!) food. They even have a small fridge full of ice cream. We came from the USA so we were a little off in our time and ended up at the lounge every night around 2:00 - 3:00 AM. I would like to give special thanks to Ivo, who is the night…"
May 2016,Relaxed and quiet with impeccable service. A real treat.,"A fabulous couple of days at this delightful hotel, where the staff look after you as if you were a special guest in their own home. We were made so welcome without any stuffiness or pretentiousness. The room and lounge were so comfortable and the food delicious. We can't wait to find an excuse to go back!"
May 2016,Superlative. #1 for a reason,"We have traveled to a number of wonderful boutique hotels across the world and I am usually not impressed with the usual offerings of sweets in the lobby, turn-down service, etc...but this hotel is truly OUTSTANDING in customer service and deserves special mention. It is rightfully in my opinion #1 in London on TA for a reason. Why? Because, quite simply, they listened and went above and beyond. You know how you get that red eye flight from the US over to Europe just so you can arrive at some unGodly hour in the morning? We got in at 7:30 am from Raleigh. I always dutifully fill out the ""guest questionnaire"" beforehand and generally expect it to arrive in the trash heap. What I requested was perhaps use of a common bathroom to freshen up a little as I knew our room would not be…"
March 2016,Amazing start to the honeymoon!!! ,"We do not know where to begin.  There's not enough words to describe the service and hospitality we have received.  We checked in after a very early start to day absolutely shattered after a long wedding weekend! We were both keen to begin our most awaited honeymoon.   The staff knew who we were as soon as we walked they greeted us and knew that we were newly weds! The personal service this hotel and it's staff provide is out of this world! Walking in to the hotel, or walking in for breakfast there is always a smile to greet you as well as the staff addressing you personally by your name.  Staff are always on hand - no request seems to big for them!   The two nights we spent there was a surpise for my new wife...she thought she was going to a Holiday Inn for two nights! The…"
November 2015,Elegant hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 days. Located next to buckingham palace, it is in a quiet neighborhood. Small boutique style hotel. We loved it. Very good service that totally pampers you. We had a two level suite that was small, but comfortable. It was located directly next to the dining area. You entered and on the first level was a small living area with tv and gas fireplace. Up a narrow stairway was the king bedroom and bath. The bathroom was luxurious with a bathtub and separate shower. I only wish the toilet had its own room. The ceiling height in the bedroom area could be a problem for some. Seemed very low!   One restaurant in the building. The food was very English, which was what we wanted. They also own the hotel next door and we frequented that bar as there was…"
March 2016,No cliché here; abundantly exceeded any expectations,"There are addresses, materials, looks, and then there are people. We oftentimes forego the persons and impress ourselves on things alone. This hotel thankfully opts to focus on the former, not that it lacks any of the latter. And for that I have no option but to rank it well above various of its more pompous competitors, including traditional ones like the Connaught and the Goring. The level of attention to detail is simply unrivaled. Congrats friends at 41, the attitude is what distinguishes you; altogether an A team. JP and I thank every one of you for one very memorable stay."
March 2016,"Exclusive, friendly, super comfortable","We travelled as a family during easter 2016. I had reserved the hotel as a surprise for my hsuband, whose 40th birthday we celebrated. I could not have picked a better hotel anywhere in the world. All the arrangements before our travel went smoothly and I found everyone on the staff very helpful and attentive towards my wishes. On arrival, everyone greeted us warmly and knew the names and ages of our boys by heart. We were led to the executive lounge where we were served champange and soft drinks and a very beautifully set up table with various ""snacks"" (the word does not honour the very high quality of everything that was served). Our rooms were perfect, during evening turndown the fire was lit, radio played sof music and there were warm water bottles in our beds. We enjoyed…"
July 2015,The BEST hotel in London,"Undisputably the best hotel in London. This place deserves every 5* review it gets. I would actually argue that it's worth visiting London just to stay here.  Staff are attentive and observant, and understand exactly how much to engage with each guest. They are incredibly knowlegable of the local area and are always willing to arrange a table etc.  There's food on offer at all times, all of the snacks are free and you can help yourself whenever you want. Breakfast is fantastic, and very competitvely priced (always opt for it if you have time).  Rooms are well furnished, and have plenty of space - even in the standard rooms."
March 2016,Believe everything you have read,"The darling wife and myself have just spent the most wonderful, relaxing and spoilt weekend, courtesy of the staff at Hotel41.   The service is beyond brilliant, but what makes it so good is the way that it is done in such and understated and subtle way. Two examples to explain this. Firstly, we had the most wonderful afternoon tea on Saturday. The tea was wonderful, but the fact that staff knew I needed more hot water for the teapot without me even asking was something else. Secondly, for our trip home the staff gave us a little 'goodie bag' to tied us over. We sat on the train and opened the box and found that they had packed it with the goodies and snacks that we had taken from the pantry during our visit. My wife had mentioned in passing on the Friday evening that she found…"
March 2016,The ultimate 5 star experience - go now!,"Our stay was perfect, and we would definately go again. The staff were the most proactive and friendly staff that I have ever experienced. They seemed sincerly  interested in us as persons, and was of assistance whenever possible. They knew our needs before we knew them ourselves. The Executive Lounge of the hotel (which all guests have access to), provided the perfect place for relaxation, a pre-dinner snack or a romantic breakfast. The room was so beatiful, that you didn't wanted to leave (see pictures on hotel home page). Our room was in perfect condition. The bed and the pillows were nice, and the soap and creme on the bathroom from Penhaligon lifted the bathing experience to the next level. We would not consider any other hotels in London for a romantic getaway."
October 2015,Loved staying here.  Very thoughtful details throughout and really friendly staff.,"Definitely worth the price due to the quality of service, beautiful and comfortable rooms, yummy food and perfect location.   It is on the top floor and very quiet too.  The concierge is very helpful with up to date events and attractions."
March 2016,An oasis in the bustling capital,"A stone's throw from the hustle and bustle of Buckingham Palace, this hotel occupies an ideal city centre location. From the moment we pulled up outside and the hotel staff immediately arranged to valet park our car with a minimum of fuss, we knew the service provided here was special. It is easy to miss the entrance to the hotel as it does not declare its presence with gaudy show but, like most boutique hotels, has an understated entrance. On entry, once we had been introduced to a charming young man named Andrew, we were ushered to the 5th floor and to the check in desk. Here we were greeted by another delightful member of staff and offered a glass of champagne from a selection on the trolley. The staff are what sets this hotel apart. They strike the right balance with guests.…"
March 2016,Awesome hotel in every way possible,"I am just back from London after 4 amazing days with my wife and family. One of the reasons it was so great was because of Hotel 41. All the things that one would expect from a hotel that advertises itself as a 5-star boutique are there. The room was spacious and well adorned (we actually had 3 showers in it), the food and lounge were great and the staff were friendly, attentive and genuinely willing to do everything they could to make our stay memorable. But moreover the intangible little things really set this place apart.  You cannot go wrong staying at Hotel 41 in London."
March 2016,Absolute perfection - top notch service!,"Our stay here was absolutely fantastic.  It's a small boutique hotel - and the staff is really superb.  The room was on the smallish side but it doesn't matter because it was perfectly decorated, cleaned wonderfully and the little touches are what makes this place fantastic (nightly turn down service; amazing bath products; free water and snacks all day/night).  At one point I sneezed and a member of the staff nearly tripped running up the stairs to make sure I had a tissue - the staff truly goes above and beyond at all times.  We've stayed at five star hotels all over but the staff here makes you feel really pampered.  We really can't say enough about this hotel and have absolutely found our forever London hotel.  We will return for sure.  We only gave our name once when we…"
March 2016,Nothing but quality ,"Booked this hotel for my partner birthday last weekend. The hotel was pure quality with top quality fittings and fixtures. The bedding was soft as were the towels and the wonderful bathrobe. The bedroom had sparkling champagne, chocolates etc which was a wonderful touch. On arrival were were given champagne and nibbles. The hotel was ideally located for exploring and very close to the palace. Staff were very well presented and all very polite. We would certainly stay here again. "
June 2015,Perfection,"Great location for hotel it was very very good in it we spent a great time there saff if the hotel was very kind and happy. Clean rooms, its not expensive a lot, it was awesome in any look . i would visit it again"
March 2016,Pampered in London,Hotel 41 is a small boutique hotel in the heart of London. We had a delightful 3-day stay. The staff was incredibly helpful and the amenities are superb. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious. Fireplace in the bedroom was lit when we came in one day: a welcomed treat after a long walk on a cold day.  Laurent at the reception was very attentive and knowledgeable about the city. We will definitely be back.
March 2016,"Perfect, we'll be back..","I booked Hotel 41 for my husbands 50th birthday based on the reviews.  Having stayed in some of the best hotels around the world with his job, I thought staying in a boutique hotel was a bit of a gamble but I needn't have worried.  The customer service surpasses any expectation, the staff are all working hard to ensure you have a great stay.  From the champagne greeting and birthday cake in the room to returning to your room at night to find scattered rose petals, candles lit, fire on, water bottle warming the bed and a little beautifully wrapped treat - there was nothing to be critical about as you will be made to feel like a VIP rather than one of many guests in a larger, bustling hotel.  Visitors to Hotel 41 will have a memorable stay and we shall certainly be returning."
March 2016,Wonderful stay in the heart of the City,"Upon arrival we were given champagne and Canapés, and sweets and nuts, the staff were absolutely fabulous couldn't do enough for you and offered us a room upgrade, which was a lovely surprise and far exceeded the room we had at Claridges last year. We were staying for our daughters graduation, and we came back with our sons and her afterwards to celebrate with a few drinks, and we all enjoyed the tasty food and snacks provided free to all guests. We have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world and this is one of the best, and next time we are visiting our sons we hope to return and stay."
March 2016,Hidden Gem in the heart of London,"This 5 star boutique hotel is a real gem, from the moment of arrival until after check out the staff of the hotel make effort to make you feel special. Addressing you always by your name and checking that everything is OK at every opportunity. Arrive hungry and thirsty as the staff take delight in feeding you with tasty snacks and to pour as much complimentary champagne and other drinks as they can. The executive lounge that forms the centre piece of the hotel reminds you of the library of Henry Higgens from ""My Fair Lady"", it is a beautiful room, spacious, simply stunning with plenty of chesterfield chairs and couches. The bedroom,(I was upgraded upon arrival), comprised of a small lounge leading to a staircase to a second floor bedroom and bathroom. The room was full of…"
March 2016,Perfect Stay...,"Cute, english style, little 20 room boutique, greeted with a friendly staff, easy to check in totally professional. First class hotel there isn't anything negative about hotel 41 it deserved 5 plus stars. Great location for walking everywhere or on the tube, and no problems couldn't stop the staff from assisting and making it happen for me. will stay there again 100 percent."
March 2016,A real jewel in the city,"I’ve travelled to London many times and stayed at a good few 5 star hotels in the city, but I have to say, the experience my wife and I had at Hotel 41 was really amazing and unforgettable. The staff; from meeting us at entrance, to the welcome at reception and check-in, to the staff serving us in the pantry area was just truly world class. It would be difficult to name just one individual. The upgrade was unexpected, but really and truly appreciated. I could go on for a while, the attention to detail in the rooms, in the lounge area and the breakfast buffet was incredible.  Thank you to you and your staff for making our stay so special."
December 2015,Christmas celebration,"Stayed for three days over Christmas with wife and Louis (the dog). Bit worried about lack of parking, but on arrival a space was found for us at rear of hotel, free over holiday period. Easy check in with Louis getting most attention....Lovely room with view over Buckingham Palace Mews. Dog given own bed and treats. Good breakfast in library. Light snacks available in evening. Louis always got his mineral water first when going to bar for a drink, how's that for service. Drank in the Rubens Hotel bar, attached to 41, bit more lively. Overall had an excellent stay, lovely staff, will be going back. Deserves its ranking...."
May 2016,"Thank you, Mrs. Tolliver!","We chose Hotel 41 for an anniversary vacation and it was a wonderful experience. The hotel is beautiful, intimate, and staffed by the nicest people you will ever meet on a trip. They helped us with theater tickets, dinner suggestions and reservations, and surprised us with a lovely anniversary cake upon arrival and candles and rose petals decorating the room one evening. The breakfasts and snacks were bountiful and delicious and we loved sampling different British gins every afternoon. The beds and bedding are luxurious and guarantee restful sleep. The best part, again, is the staff. They were unfailingly friendly and helpful and I hope to be able to go back to this lovely place next year!"
July 2015,Simply the best in London,"This is really the best hotel in London. I really enjoyed my room, the staff is simply incredibile!! Super breakfast with all that you need. It's not cheap, but hey, if you want the best just come here and pay IT :-) i will return here very soon. 5 stars "
May 2016,4+1 stars!!,"The worst thing about hotel 41, is that you have to leave!!   Form the moment you walk down the Pall Mall and round the corner, to the hotel you know you're in for a treat... Everyone know's your name and you feel like a celeb! All the staff are kind, lovely, polite and chatty, the snacks are awesome, breakfast is spot on and the room is as classy as it gets! I just wish we could have stayed longer"
March 2016,First class ,I must say that my stay at the Hotel was a very enjoyable one. The staff could not do enough for us. The breakfast was lovely and room more then you can expect. Will be recommending this hotel to all our friends. Thank you so much we will be back one day.
April 2016,Best hotel we have ever stayed in!  A+,"We had the most fabulous and memorable stay at Hotel 41.  It is truly one of the nicest hotel we have ever enjoyed.  The hotel is beautiful with luxurious accommodations, a wonderful intimate executive lounge, and special treats everywhere!  From the moment we arrived, we felt like royalty and as if we were guests in your private home.  We were greeted by name by all the hotel staff and felt extremely comfortable and welcome.  The customer service is wonderful- friendly, warm, and attentive.  Everyone went out of their way to greet us daily, ask us about our day's activities, offer recommendations, and seemed truly interested in getting to know us.  My 12 year old son had the time of his life!  We were celebrating his birthday, and we were welcomed with a special birthday cake,…"
March 2016,Simply superb,"This is a hidden jewel of a hotel situated right next to Buckingham Palace.   We arrived at the hotel and were surprised to find a beautiful but very small entrance. The doorman took us up an elevator and through some wood paneled corridors into a sublime room at he hearth if the hotel where we checked in, had a welcome glass of champagne and were shown to our suite. It reminded me of the journey of Alice into wonderland!  Try staff were lovely, helpful and refreshingly characterful. They replied with s straight face to our request for a taxi with ""I'm afraid we cannot do that sir"", followed a second later with a beaming smile saying ""Of course! Where would you like to go"".  The room the the heart of the hotel served the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had.   I've travelled a lot…"
April 2016,"Boutique pampering, worth the cost","Stayed only 3 nites, wish it was 3 weeks! The hotel is the top floor of the neighboring parter hotel next door, but when you enter you are in a world unto itself. Very plush, more staff than guests. Everything we could want was provided, including last minute show tickets, dining reservations, recommendations, you name it. The food in the common room was excellent, we stopped having late dinners out and just ate there. Staff knows your name and preferences. The room was small but luxe, wonderful bed ad amenities. will def stay there again,"
March 2016,Fabulous hotel,So we were the biggest supporters of the Firmdale boutique hotels which are fabulous but decided to try Hotel 41 as it is highly ranked on Trip advisor! Well it is well deserving of its high ranking! Lovely  hotel! Staff are all fabulous and the rooms are great. In the evening you get back and housekeeping have turned down the room and classical music is playing which is so peaceful and relaxing! When you check in they serve you a glass of champagne!! The lounge area where you can relax with a drink or have a snack is so cosy! They have complimentary snacks throughout the day too. The breakfasts are simply delicious! Highly recommend it!!!
April 2016,Amazing hotel with even more amazing staff,From the moment we stepped into the hotel we were welcomed with open arms.  The staff went over and above to make us feel comfortable and important. It was almost as though they knew what we wanted or needed before we did.  We feel as though we have made new friends and would definitely stay at this beautiful hotel on our next visit to London.
February 2016,Outstanding Service,"This was our second stay at Hotel 41 (previous being January 2015).  Both stays have been outstanding.  The location perfect for central London.  You are within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Parliament, St. James Park and Green Park.   Our room for this stay was a split level suite.  The seating area on the lower level was perfect for reading and relaxing .  The upper level sleeping area as luxurious, cozy and comfortable.  The bathroom was quite large with a heated towel rack adding a nice touch.     I would be remiss if I didn't mention the service and the Executive Lounge.  These two features are what set Hotel 41 apart from others.  Simply put, the staff is outstanding.  They are very helpful from the time you walk in the door until after you…"
March 2016,OMG just simply isn't enough to describe this property,"I have traveled a lot in my lifetime and there are no words to truly describe our recent stay (March 2016) at this Hotel.  From the moment we arrived until the moment we left, we were treated like royalty.    I would have to say that the Hotel 41 was the best hotel, ever.  Ever!  Amazing service, amazing location, amazing staff."
May 2016,BEST HOTEL ON THE PLANET!,"I have never written a review of anything on Trip Advisor but feel compelled to let everyone know how fantastic Hotel 41 is.  The staff is simply unbelievable.  They are welcoming, gracious, friendly, funny, and took care of our every need.  The accommodations were beautiful but it was the staff who made our stay extraordinary.  We felt like royalty.  They know who you are when you come in, you never sign for anything throughout your stay, they keep track of everything, they provide anything that you need and more.   They booked tickets for us for a show, made reservations for high tea.  I can't list all the things they did, but the staff is just incredible and made our stay in London a perfect 10.  My husband and I both agree that it was the best hotel experience we have ever…"
May 2016,Superb hotel,"  Having spent 2 x Nights at Hotel 41,Buckingham Palace Road,London,myself and my Wife would like to express our Sincere Thanks and Gratitude to all of the Hotel 41 Staff for their Excellent Service and Attention to Detail. Our stay was thoroughly enjoyable indeed,the Accommodation,Food,Staff,Housekeeping and Overall Ambience were Genuinely 5 Star. We very much look forward to a return stay in the near future.  Regards, Mr & Mrs B Concannon. "
March 2016,super stay in super hotel,"We have just returned from a 2 week stay in London!We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.  We were upgraded on arrival, everything is spotlessly clean, staff extremely pleasant and always helpful. We were eagerly anticipating this trip based upon the previous reviews we had read and we were not disapointed!"
May 2016,Only wish I could add more stars to the rating!,"We just arrived home after our stay at Hotel 41 in London and haven't stopped talking about it.  I was a bit disappointed when I returned to my own home to find that there was no pantry to plunder or rose petals on my bed or filled candy dishes & fresh fruit in my room or friendly faces wanting to grant my every wish...but that is what made Hotel 41 so special!  Everything was so amazing during our stay, I even believe the staff had something to do with unusually sunny weather we experienced.    We stayed in the Balmoral Suite and had trouble deciding between one of the THREE showers to use each day.  Did I mention the candles and aromatherapy pillow spray at turndown? There isn't a detail that Hotel 41 hasn't implemented.  Since we know we will return and I will most definitely…"
November 2015,Just as I remembered!!!!,My first visit to Hotel 41 was two years ago with my sisters and mom for a very special birthday weekend for my mom's 70th Birthday - and everything was perfect as I wrote in an earlier review.  I loved Hotel 41 so much that I returned with my 2 teenage children and husband this past November for Thanksgiving week and we had a WONDERFUL TIME!  We booked two rooms that were across from one another with a door that locked to the outside - they were as adjoining as much as any European hotel could be.  Both rooms were wonderful and just as my prior visit - everything was perfect!!!! Hotel 41 is special and anyone who has stayed there knows this!  They treat their guest like royalty and even better - like family! If you want large rooms and a bustling hotel this would not be for…
May 2016,Welcomed like old friends,"We returned for our fourth visit to 41 and were given such a lovely welcome by Lauren and her team.  This really is a very special place.  If you are looking for a large, busy hotel with spa/gym facilities etc., then this is not for you.  However, if you are like us and enjoy a small, intimate boutique style hotel where nothing is too much trouble and you are made to feel special, then head to 41.  Yes it is an expensive treat, but you more than get what you pay for and the care and attention from everyone is just amazing.  We had a lovely surprise when we were upgraded to the Monarch Suite overlooking the Palace Mews - just perfect.  It was lovely to meet the new members of staff who were all absolutely lovely and delighted to see a fellow Glaswegian, Andrew, on board.  This is…"
May 2016,Exceptional service,"Had a 2 night weekend stay. Service was first class. Nothing too much trouble and everybody really friendly. Champagne on arrival a lovely touch and the larder is great for a snack any time of the day, though in the evening it's effectively a full meal - we had steak and ale pie on the second night. Go on -treat yourself..."
May 2016,Made to feel at home.,"I first came across Hotel 41 through the reviews on trip advisor. After viewing the hotels website we decided to book the conservatory suite. We wasn't disappointed!   The staff are great. I cannot fault them. Everyone was very friendly and couldn't do enough for us. They have the perfect mix of being there when you need them but leaving you to your own devices.   After seeing some of the reviews on trip advisor I was slightly dubious as to whether the hotel might be a bit pretentious but I didn't find it that way at all. It was very relaxed but classy all the same.   The room we had was spacious and had every amenity we could think of. We loved the glass roof, the large shower and bath. Not forgetting the huge and very comfortable bed.  The staff booked us into a very nice…"
May 2016,WOW!,I booked this months ago for my husband's 'big' birthday and for a surprise day/night out in London. The hotel staff were fantastic from start to finish - I emailed them initially enquiring about the packages they offered. The communication was brilliant as my original package changed when Billy Elliot closed in April. From the moment we walked through the door the staff were amazing - I have never been anywhere like this and we have travelled to 5* + hotels abroad.  I cannot thank them enough - our stay was amazing. They upgraded us to the Master Suite (conservatory roof) and the room is fabulous - we wanted to move in! The pantry is amazing too and the food is so fresh. Breakfast was brilliant and although I can rave on I really think the staff make Hotel 41 the place it is.…
May 2016,A week in London,"What a great experience! so much to say about a weeks stay in London - the ENTIRE staff at Hotel 41 goes 'above and beyond' to make sure the stay is not only enjoyable but memorable. Breakfasts were soooo good. Book the room/stay to include and you will not be disappointed. While rooms were a bit small our upgraded too room suite, with two bathrooms gave us ample room. We quickly learned we packed too much so lesson learned. Located a block from Buckingham Palace, the Victoria Train/Tube station and within walking distance from restaurants and shopping on the West End make this an ideal location. When in London again, no hesitation on where we will stay!"
March 2016,"Beautiful hotel, quite unusual - but a few disappointments!","We stayed here in March, for my husband's 60th birthday, it was a surprise treat for him that I'd been planning since November, so I was very excited when I gave him the details the week before. When you arrive, the area downstairs is quite small and you are taken in the lift up to the 5th floor where, when you exit, you enter the hotel properly and wow what a wonderful place, the lounge area absolutely beautiful with it's conservatory style roof and stunning decor. When we arrived the staff were very friendly and attentive and Adele showed us our room where they'd left petit fours and a lovely chocolate birthday cake for my husband. We stayed in room 4119 for 2 nights, it was beautiful and laid out over 2 floors - very unusual. We had booked the BBar restaurant for the 1st…"
May 2016,Amazing luxury in the heart of London,"Hotel 41 is a wonderful intimate hotel in an excellent location, convenient to everything yet quiet and peaceful. Neither flashy nor loud, Hotel 41 is a perfect refuge with a refined, welcoming atmosphere. Every staff member we encountered was congenial and professional. My room was beautifully decorated and very comfortable; Wi-Fi worked great.  The guest lounge area is the best set up I have found in a luxury boutique hotel, it was lovely and elegant, and we were so impressed by Stefan, the primary host, who was beyond exceptional. My triple cappuccino also awaited me each morning.  After working and walking all day, my colleague and I enjoyed cocktails and snacks each evening in the guest lounge - just divine. Now that we have stayed here, we can't imagine staying anywhere…"
May 2016,"If you want to feel like home, this is the place to be !","We were at the Conservatory Suite under a roof in glass. From you bed you can see the birds fly over...what a lovely experience. But, concretely : the beds are wonderful, the bathroom is spacious with rain shower, regular shower and jacuzzi, there is a separate room to sit and enjoy a drink. Coffee and tea can be made. Breakfast is nice and is being served in a british/south african like lounge room. There is a buffet serving hot and cold dishes that you can plunder for free. Additionally there is ice cream that you can grab and a wide variety of drinks. If you want to be pampered and feel at home in a big city, than this is the place you want to be. Enjoy like we did !"
May 2016,A fantastic find in London,"London is a difficult and expensive place to find a good hotel. Look no further than Hotel 41. Carved out of an old-fashioned hotel across from the Royal Mews, the 41 offers impeccable service, lovely rooms, well-appointed baths, and a family-like staff. The Executive Lounge -- akin to a lobby, but as intimate as a traditional London club -- has comfortable seating, an ongoing supply of food, and a convivial atmosphere.  The perfect place to retreat from the hubbub of the big city, whether you travel for business or pleasure."
May 2016,The BEST,"The hotel is small, but perfect. Rooms are decorated beautifully and have everything you might need. Food and drink is always available in the Executive Lounge which is the perfect place to relax before and after exploring London. The food and drink selection is excellent. The location is great too. The absolute best part of the hotel though is the staff- service is top notch; they are so friendly and helpful, willing to go above and beyond, and delightful to talk to. Hotel 41 is instantly one of my favorite hotels and I've stayed in many! Can't wait to go back!"
June 2015,Great Hotel!,"I have stayed a the hotel a number of times now, the hotel is excellent, clean and tidy, staff were extremely polite and helpful. Highly recommend....  In terms of value for money, this hotel is amazing."
May 2016,exceptional stay,"The hotel is lovely, rooms are comfortable and the staff and atmosphere are excellent.  The hotel provides a cozy lounge for breakfast and for cocktails, It is an absolute pleasure to stay at this hotel."
May 2016,First Visit to London!,"Top Service.  Friendly!   Food Drink always available.  Helpful staff.   I thought the Suite would be fun, but my knee did not like the full staircase from the sitting room to the bedroom. Beautiful treats left out for us each night.  Great cocktails in the Lounge for extra $$.  Champagne Bar next door.  Across from Buckingham Palace.  We easily walked to the Irish Guards' Museum."
May 2016,Very lovely.....,"My wife and I stayed for one night at 41, our first visit here, on a very rare evening away without the children!  Even though it was just a short stay for us it really was the perfect choice for a special and romantic night away.  The staff were all so friendly and attentive but never intrusive.  The service felt very personal and it is clear that the hotel takes great pride in ensuring its guests feel looked after and valued.    The Executive Lounge is a great place to just unwind and chat over a glass or two of something chilled.  It's also really rather fab to return to after a night out with its wonderful choice of complimentary snacks to enjoy before bedtime!  We'd absolutely recommend if like us you want somewhere special, peaceful and romantic."
January 2016,A Magical Pocket of Perfection!,"My husband & i have been to '41' on many occasions  ~ Absolutely every time we stay at this gorgeous hotel we are SOO totally happy!!! We have stopped trying other hotels in London….. Nowhere else 'ticks all the boxes'. Terrific location, always the most fabulous reception the moment we arrive, lovely staff who make us feel genuinely & warmly welcomed.  The entire package is Amazing & having to leave is dreadful!   We happily nest in the lounge for hours ~ Sink into the sofa beside the fire, served cracking canapés & warm mini ham toasties etc.  The 'pantry' is very exciting too, throughout the day x night it is bursting with Goodies… cheese/Deli gems, chocolates and sweets and fruit and…!  However, if you are still hungry and fancy some fresh air, walking is a pleasure in the…"
February 2016,A true boutique,"Hotel 41 is a place unlike most.  At 41, you get the service of a 5-star hotel, the décor of a proper London dwelling, and the feeling of being at home.  Unlike most places, the only people allowed into the hotel are the guests.  While at other hotels the elevators and lounge spots may be taken by persons off the street, at 41 the entire experience is about the guests.  The GM, Mr. Hendry, can be found in the lounge talking with guests and staff, ensuring the hotel is doing everything to accommodate needs you may have.  Lauren at the desk is astute and just seems to get it, anticipating what you are looking for and providing the exact right information or assistance.  And their staff work as hard (and are as kind) as any I have seen in my travel.  The best example from 41’s…"
February 2016,Fantastic Stay,"We have just returned from a fabulous two night stay at Hotel 41 in London.  The hotel staff were friendly, polite, attentive and ready to assist whenever required.  We returned fro seeing 'Wicked' to find that the staff had arranged for the CD from the show to be playing in our room.  As we left, we were sent on our way with complimentary sweets and coffees for the journey - brilliant!!"
February 2016,Amazing stay,"It was amazing stay. We felt like a king :) Our room was spacious, very well equipment. Bed was very soft and comfortable. The location is also very good - a few steps to Victoria underground station and to the Buckingham Palace. The staff was wonderful especially Polish ladies: Magdalena, Patrycja and Paula. It is really worth to be there and it's for sure our No 1:) in London.   Paweł & Joanna"
January 2016,Amazing stay - the staff are the stars,"This is such a special place, a unique little haven of calm in Central London. The minute we arrived, we were warmly welcomed and swiftly helped with all the chaos of our bags and small dog, to immediate calm. Even before arrival, with various phone conversations and emails, the service was excellent, and that just continued throughout our stay.   The hotel itself is quiet and relaxing, with the Lounge the central area for checking in (the front desk staff here are so helpful and lovely), and for eating, drinking and relaxing (or working, if you have to). Steve and the rest of the staff here just make you feel so welcome, are genuinely friendly without being intrusive, and are always on hand to tempt you with the various delicious complimentary delights that are laid on…"
September 2015,A Private Retreat in a Great Location,This hotel is excellently located next to Buckingham Palace and very close to Victoria Station.  It is the perfect retreat after a busy day in the city or to recover from a long flight.    The library and lounge area surrounds you with quiet and graceful English elegance - you'll feel like you're in the library at Downton Abbey for a cup of tea with the Duke and Duchess.  The rooms are also beautifully decorated and well insulated from the sounds of the city which helps to provide for a good night's sleep.   The staff and service is excellent and very attentive to your every need.  Advice: Finding this hotel can be a bit tricky since the outside is very understated.  I often have to tell the cabbie to go to the Ruben's Hotel which is next door to Hotel 41.
January 2016,Fabulous,"Worthy of the all rave reviews. We stayed for 2 nights and I could have cheerfully moved in!  Quiet, friendly but exemplary service, super breakfasts, great complimentary evening supper courtesy of the ""plunder the pantry"" facility. Definitely worth booking in advance for the best prices and worth asking the team to source theatre tickets etc.  We would stay again in a heartbeat."
January 2016,Perfect Anniversary,"This was a truly wonderful, relaxing stay. The staff were so attentive, nothing was too much trouble. We were thoroughly spoilt with champagne on arrival, a gorgeous cake for our anniversary, and a very quiet room. Considering this is central London, it was like an oasis, very relaxing indeed. We will definitely be returning to 41 !"
February 2016,Amazing Hotel worthy of 6 stars,"My husband and I travel extensively and stay in hotels all over the UK, usually  of a four or five  star rating.  How this Hotel has not got 6 stars I do not know!  You will not be disappointed if you choose this Hotel.  Once you stay here you will not wish to stay anywhere else in London again.   The welcome reception was really lovely with a drink and nibbles on arrival.  A beautiful executive lounge to sit in and relax.   All of the staff are exceptionally lovely and nothing is too much trouble.  They really do make you feel very special.   Our room 4101 was very comfortable with views over the Royal Mews.  The bed was huge and very comfortable, high quality sheets and pillows and luxury duvet.   The bathroom had large bath and shower with ample Penhaligon toiletries, luxury…"
February 2016,Simply fabulous ,"My recent stay at hotel 41 exceeded all expectations and I can see why the hotel is number one in London.  The two ladies that helped me at check in and check out were excellent and could not do enough for me.  The hotel is beautiful as is the room. The fire place in particular is a wonderful touch.  The drinks and snacks in the executive lounge were also great and the service impeccable. As was the food I ordered by room service, absolutely delicious.  All in all hotel 41 is an excellent place to stay and I would recommend the hotel to anybody who is going to London.  I hope to return soon. "
May 2015,Service beyond compare,"Our stay lasted a week, so we had the full experience and can confidently say their service is beyond compare. The main lounge is remarkable, being both elegant and comfortable; You can truly relax here. You sip cocktails by the fire and feel you are in the home of a good friend who just happens to make killer martinis. Having tea in the late afternoon? Be sure to leaf through any of a number of gorgeous coffee table books on Rock Gods or Fashion or Art & Architecture which you always mean to purchase, never do and turn out to be even more interesting than you imagined. This is where you will have breakfast and breakfast *is* the most important meal of the day. Every day my husband had something new and every day I had the same two egg omelette with toast and tea; Every day our…"
February 2016,Attentive Service,"Centrally located in a quintessential old-style London hotel. The service levels were incredibly high. In fact, I have never experienced this level of service in London. I highly recommend this hotel."
February 2016,Perfect birthday ,"I recently visited hotel 41 for my birthday and it was the most wonderful stay.  Everyone was so welcoming and friendly.   I was greeted with champagne and a plethora of snacks throughout the day.  The service is above and beyond what I expected. And as the reviews set out, definitely worth the #1 rating.   Thanks again to everyone at the hotel. It was truly exceptional. "
February 2016,Beyond expectations,"We went for a short break to celebrate my wife's special birthday and there could be no better place to be. The hotel is accessed via a smart entrance off Buckingham Palace Road and a lift takes you to the hotel which is located on the fifth floor. The heart of the hotel is the executive lounge where breakfast is served and there are a variety of snacks available throughout the day. Nothing is too much to ask for and the polite, smart and professional staff were the best in the business. There are two young lads who are working in the hotel as part of their professional studies and they will no doubt go on to top jobs in their chosen careers.   We travelled with our dog, Rocky, and he was treated like royalty.   The hotel itself is only small, but the staff/customer ratio is…"
February 2016,Phonomenal!,"We spent last night at Hote41 and it was quite possibly the most fabulous hotel stay we have ever had (and there have been a few!)   The staff could not do enough for us, and the surroundings are beautiful. Our room was stunning, and every need that you could have, was catered for. The members of staff addressed you by name and made you feel truly important.  I would go back in a heartbeat!"
February 2016,Believe the reviews,"Hotel 41 really is that good- the attention to detail is impeccable. We have had a hugely enjoyable overnight stay. Our mystery ""turn down"" lady came and went whilst we were at The Royal Albert Hall; we returned to a roaring fire, candles and rose petals which was a true pleasure to behold- she clearly took a lot of trouble to make it look wonderful and succeeded Book a night- it's worth it!"
January 2016,Best birthday & engagement celebration weekend!,"The staff and the service are what makes this hotel stand out above the rest, from the doorman opening our taxi door and carrying our bags inside, to the offer of bottled water for our journey home, and everything in between, our stay was nothing short of magical! The Conservatory suite has to be seen to be believed - a TV in the bathroom (along with jacuzzi bath and double length shower), a separate lounge area with a fire, TV and mini bar, and the most comfortable bed ever! Breakfast was superb - a choice of cooked or continental with such a vast choice of pastries, cereals, fruit, bread, meat, cheese.... Our suite included complimentary sewing kit, shoe shine kit, dental kit, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, bubble bath, tissues, cotton buds and cotton wool pads. Dressing…"
January 2016,Incredible pampering,"The entire hotel experience is guest-focused down to the last detail. From the moment you check-in, you're treated like the only customer they've ever had, and the staff is happy to meet your every need and whim. The rooms are very stylish and comfortable, the turn down service is delightful, and the nightly snack buffet was delicious. I especially enjoyed having an entire tea service brought up to my room and poured for me each morning - certainly eased the wake up process!"
October 2015,A real VIP experience,"The building and your surroundings are absolutely beautiful but the staff are fantastic and make such a difference. This must be what it is like to be treated like Royalty. What a fantastic experience. The service is 1st class and exemplary without being intrusive. The rooms are fabulous, the little touches make the stay extra special.  The reception team were so helpful. I can not find a single fault with 41. If you get the chance go and stay here!"
January 2016,Anniversary weekend,"Amazing, amazing, amazing....Everything you can ever want and more. Quite possibly the most attentive and helpful staff anywhere in the world. Amazing location, wonderfully appointed rooms. The free food and drink are of the highest quality,The paid for food and drink is worth every penny. I would be happy to live here for the rest of my life (finances depending) but otherwise I will just have to enjoy it when I can.  Please go and find out for yourselves how great this hotel is!"
February 2016,Outstanding Hotel,"Is it really that good? ""YES""  Hotel 41 is found opposite the Royal Mews on Buckingham Palace Rd.  The outside doesn't look very grand compared to other well known hotels, but the looks are deceiving.  Once inside a very smart lobby you'll greeted by a member of the team who quickly whisk you away to the lounge to be checked in.  Welcome champange was a loverly treat whilst filling in some paper work and told about the hotel and it's plentiful supply of treats.  The room was truly amazing.  A massive bed, everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel and more. Some really nice touches' that made us feel special.  Loved the turn down service.  The hotel in centred around the lounge area which to my taste felt like a old Englishman's  library/smoking room.  Nice leather sofa's,…"
February 2016,my favourite place,"This was my third visit to 41 and it was to celebrate my daughter 21 birthday .They decorated the room with balloons and a birthday cake .This time we were in a room which faced the royal mews and it was amazing .We were booked on the wicked experiance which include tickets and a dinner ,the seats were indeed amazing but given the fact that I use crutches and 41 are aware of this I was horrified to discover that there were 27 steps down to them as when I asked for the package I said I cant do steps . , this caused me immense pain and discomfort as I am not meant to climb steps .Once back at hotel I mentioned this to them and by way of apology they covered my drinks bill and gave me a cd of wicked which was nice .Another part of the wicked experience is turndown with cupcakes but…"
February 2016,Wow ,This has to be the very best hotel I have stayed in whilst staying in London.  The location is very close to Buckingham palace and I felt like actual royalty throughout my stay.  The staff could not do any more for their guests. They are perfection. You walk through the door and everything is quality. So beautiful is the decor it took my breath away.  The bedroom was a fabulous style and size. Layout worked very well. Attention to detail shows and the quality of fixtures and fittings is first class.  What a beautiful place to stay.  I cannot wait to go back here. It was perfect!!!!
February 2016,perfect for a 3-night stay,"I stayed at Hotel 41 for three nights. I find it a perfect base for theatre visits and daytime sightseeing; in my case re-visiting beloved spots. As a lone traveller it is a wonderful feeling to be welcomed at the end of the day and then again at the end of the evening, after the theatre."
February 2016,astonishing,"we had high expectations of this place having read all the previous reviews and wondered if really it could be that good for us more ordinary folks.  unfortunately I was wrong..... it was BETTER. All the other reviews do a great job of describing how special this place is and how it makes you feel like royalty.  the hotel is small and unique in its design and is in a really great location for visiting lots of tourist sites. however, what makes this place stand out so much is the staff who all were exceptional, though I should give special mention to flo who welcomed us with champagne and showed us to our room and then looked after us every time he was on duty.  Also Nicole who I understand has not worked for Red Carnation for very long but she was very efficient and charming and…"
February 2016,Amazing place and has everything you need for a perfect stay,"Incredible experience! It was one of the best stay that we had in London and we thoroughly enjoyed it. My husband had booked this stay for me as a birthday surprise. Once you enter to the hotel you're greeted like a celebrity or VVIP.. The entire hotel was decorated in Chic Black and White breathtaking decor and located opposite to Buckingham Palace. From Reception desk to reaching at our room, the staff was so so friendly and helpful. We loved our room. It was very comfortable, with built in fireplace and the the moment I entered the room there was a surprise waiting for me.. We were completely blown away by what this beautiful place offered to us. I will definitely stay here again. In addition to this there were some other perks such as champagne on arrival, free snacks and a…"
February 2016,Amazing Place and Staff,"Wow what an experience, all the great reviews do not do this place justice.  I had my stay booked for me as a 50th Birthday surprise and what a surprise it was.  My wife and I stayed in the Executive King room and we were greeted with a choice of champagne and treats whilst we checked in before being shown to our room.  All the staff are on hand to help and nothing is too much trouble, truly professional caring people.  We had a fantastic evening meal and the breakfast was excellent too. Every part of the hotel is pristine and the food is excellent but the things that really make the difference are the staff.   We plan to come back later in the year and again for our 25th wedding anniversary next year.  An amazing place to switch off from the world and to be bathed in luxury…"
February 2016,A gem in the heart of London,"Wonderful charming little gem , with fantastic staff. No possible to ask more. Very confortables rooms, fantastic Lounge for breakfast, tea time and pre-dinner aperitif or post dinner last glass. Every one totally committed to the guests"
February 2016,What a tremendous staff!,"My husband and I were blown away by what a lovely hotel this was.  You are greeted like a special guest from the moment you walk through the front door.  The ""attention to detail"" is an understatement.  It was a dreary, cold, wet night our first evening and to climb into bed to find a hot water bottle between the sheets was amazing!  We loved all the staff but Adele was particularly gracious and helpful.  We dined in the amazing library as well as in room dining..everything was delicious!  As far as location..when your next store neighbor is the Queen of England, I say it's a great neighborhood!"
February 2016,Amazing,"I'd heard about this hotel online and decided to book as a treat for my partner and I. From the moment we entered the hotel we were treated extremely well. The staff are really friendly and go out of their way to make the stay as comfortable as possible. The room was beautiful, everything was thought of. The food is brilliant especially the breakfast. We also enjoyed afternoon tea which was exquisite. What we couldn't finish was boxed up for our train journey home. The location is perfect for site seeing. We were sad to leave but we can't wait for our next visit. I really can't rate the hotel and the service high enough."
December 2015,The Best Staff in London,"I stayed at 41 for the third time this year-- so clearly I am a fan.  Here are some of my thoughts. This hotel can compete on every front that most people judge a hotel. The rooms are very nicely appointed--classic English style, very tastefully done. The beds are very comfortable (you might need that wakeup call so as to not oversleep...I do) The rooms in which I have stayed have had the shower separate from the bath, a fireplace, an excellent television with full Sky premium programming amongst other amenities. That is the baseline. However, what makes this hotel shine so bright is its staff-- I cannot say that I have seen better in London.   Firstly, the staff members are always beautifully attired and present themselves in a first class manner. They always seem to be aware…"
December 2015,1st class in all departments,Went to London for Christmas shopping and a show with my wife Hotel 41 was the icing on the cake Treated like royalty from the time we went through the door until we left Staff couldn't do enough for us Will certainly be staying at 41 when we go back to London 
December 2015,Outstanding establishment ,"Stayed for Christmas and anniversary trip. Staff at 41 are better than anywhere else I have stayed, so attentive and everything with our stay was personalised to us! So thoughtful. Great location for London hotel. Fantastic stay and will definitely be back when we can! "
February 2015,London Style and Luxury,"The rooms in this lovely hotel are on the top floor and some have working fireplaces. I cannot say enough about the gracious staff. Every single person was fabulous and wanted to make sure all was perfect.  I particularly love the champagne offered upon arrival. My room was comfortable and spotless with a view of the Royal Mews. I appreciated the tasteful decor throughout 41.  I enjoyed  breakfast in the hotel, ""Plunder the Pantry""which gave me access to snacks throughout the day, hors d'oeuvres in the lounge in the evening, free ice cream and the perfectly stocked honesty bar.   No request is too difficult. I asked for arrangements for a car to take me to the Royal Opera House and the staff was happy to do that or to call a taxi for me. I was given easy walking directions for…"
December 2015,This is a REAL Gem,"WOW, this hotel is AMAZING, our second visit to 41, equally as impressive as our first visit. Attention to detail is first class, great rooms, very comfortable and the fire is a real treat when you go to your room after a long day in London. The executive lounge, with its roaring fire and great food and drink selection is a must.  Very hard to fault this GREAT hotel & the staff are all FANTASTIC.  Can't wait for the next visit."
May 2015,Just when you think it can't get any better... it does!,"This is my sixth stay at 41. Again, I am lost for words as to the level of service provided by this property, the level of support, the degree to which the staff are willing to go.  It is incredible and it is better than a home from home. It is an entire team devoted to ensuring you are comfortable and that all your needs are met- no matter what they are. It does not matter if you need an extremely rare object, they will look, or if you need someone to set up a perfect platter. Whatever it is, the staff will take wonderful care of you.  For everyone considering Hotel 41 for their stay in London, I beseech you not to look elsewhere. Do yourself a favor and stay here- I have stayed in many of the world's finest hotels, including most of London's, and there is nowhere that can even…"
December 2015,No way can this be the best hotel in London........,Yes its a nice hotel. The staff are excellent and the rooms are comfortable. But it doesn't compare with the luxury and facilities of the likes of The Dorchester etc. It operates a mega expensive even for London honesty bar system. So don't get caught out at checkout. The rooms are well equipped with various toiletries only what you would expect at the room rate. Summing up. Its nothing special. If you travel a lot and have experienced some of the worlds leading hotels this is like a glorified B & B with good staff.
December 2015,Comfortable and friendly,"We had a faultless and very enjoyable one-night stay here. We booked a standard room but were upgraded on arrival to what was described as the best room in the house (4104) - it was on two floors, with a cost sitting area complete with flame gas fire downstairs and bedroom and large bathroom upstairs. The crowning glory was a large glass atrium over the bed, with a panoramic view of the heavens above! My wife arrived very early, well before check-in time (I had a meeting in town), and was offered every courtesy and full use of the comfortable lounge until the room was available. Throughout our stay the staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful. We were on a breakfast-inclusive rate and the breakfast was superb. We had an evening meal at the adjoining B-Bar (part of…"
December 2015,Amazing customer service,"Have visited 5 star hotels all over the world and this without doubt was my beat customer service experience. Stayed for 2 nights over the weekend, on arrival all members of staff were very welcoming and we enjoyed some champaign. Not all my stay was perfect in the aspect the floors are very noisy when trying to sleep, so had a sleepless couple of nights. What i will say though is I still give this a five star simply for presentation and service from all employees, so for them to get me to look past this was fantastic. Each and every member of staff took a genuine interest in your days and plans and I would definitely be visiting the hotel again."
December 2015,50th Birthday Treat,"We visited 41 for two nights from the the 2nd to 4th December.  It was to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday and we had two rooms. One they set up as a twin for my two grown up daughters (4109) and a king size for ourselves (4105).  Both rooms were fabulous and have just about everything you could ever need. The staff are absolutely first class and cater for your every need. I cannot fault the service we had from the moment we checked in to the moment we left so thank you to Andrew and the team......  It's probably the most I've ever paid for a room at a hotel but have to say it was good value compared to other top end London hotels and if in London again this is where we will stay.  If you want a peaceful, quiet hotel with top service look no further. "
December 2015,Best hotel I have ever stayed in for service,"The reviews on here are all excellent and justifiably so.  We stayed here the night after our wedding as we needed somewhere to stay before flying to New York the next day for our honeymoon. We treated ourselves to the Romance Package and didn't look back.  You truly are treated like a VIP from the minute you enter the door. The staff chat to you like they actually care and you can choose from an array of hot drinks or (limitless) champagne after you check-in.  The room, although on the smaller side, is immaculately decorated and very relaxing. It has all mod cons you would expect from a luxury hotel and not everything costs (i.e. proper tea and coffee on offer with biscuits, full Sky TV, really nice bathroom amenities). As we went for the romance package we were spoiled with…"
January 2016,Truly amazing,"I visited Hotel 41 on New Year's day to propose to my girlfriend. I had the help of the wonderful staff, particularly Adele, Gina and Lauren who were extremely helpful throughout my entire stay.   My room was upgraded to a suite and there was champagne and treats on arrival. After my (successful) proposal there was a surprise in the executive lounge where we were reserved a space by the fireplace and treated with even more champagne. The lounge is also wonderfully supplied with all sorts of goodies. All of the staff are attentive, friendly and they made the evening very special for us.   It is by far the best hotel I've ever stayed at and I'm glad I decided to plan my proposal here."
January 2016,"Do you want to be treated like ""Royalty"" all the while staying across from Buckingham Palace ?","....then stay at Hotel 41 !!! Be prepared...London will be a very expensive visit because of the exchange rate on our Canadian dollar. But, for that once in a life time experience, save your bucks and stay at Hotel 41. It is a boutique 5 star hotel right across from the ""Mews"" of Buckingham Palace. This means you will not be looking at the main building but will be facing the huge brick wall surrounding the outer buildings of the Palace. Believe it or not the wall is actually very impressive looking as it has huge spikes and barbed wire on it's top and it surrounds the Palace grounds until you walk around to the magnificent front gates. I was told that if a person was ever stupid enough to scale the wall there are armed guards patrolling on the other side that would not hesitate…"
January 2016,Simply the Best,"This was our second visit to Hotel 41 and our third to a Red Carnation Hotel (all fantastic hotels by the way).  There was a minor incident on our first visit that made us hesitate to re-book, but we were arriving late and the 24 hour Plunder the Pantry tipped the scales in its favour (the pantry is complementary and stocked with a large variety of high quality food items). I am very glad we stayed again. The staff are all so eager to please, the lounge has so much character and is so comfortable and cozy, and the room we were upgraded to was out of this world.  It is the epitome of hospitality-I only wish we could have stayed longer!"
November 2015,Lovely hotel,"The hotel is fantastic. I loved everything about it. From their efficient services to the interior design of the rooms. Staff very friendly, they really look after you. Would come back here next year."
January 2016,5 Stars with a dog,"We wanted to go to London, go to a show and stay in a luxurious hotel that would accept our dog, Louis. The description and photos of Hotel 41 looked like it may fit the bill, so we booked online. The friendliness and efficiency of Hotel 41 revealed itself immediately we pulled up outside. Our baggage - and the dog were unloaded rapidly and we were signed in (after an offer of a glass of champagne) and shown to our room for the night. Included in the room was a welcoming pack for Louis which comprised a dog bed (perfect size) a toy, a tin of food, water bowls, a do not disturb sign (for the dog) and a breakfast menu (for the Dog!) This level of service indicated the attention you get if you only have two legs! that was soon verified.  Everything in this hotel is pristine, the…"
January 2016,the perfect is not always the enemy of the good,"hotel 41 for all its glamour and luxury and harry potter with a fashion sensitive upgrade executive lounge is all about the staff. They have hospitality down to a perfect art. That and the 5 star setting belies the adage that the perfect is the enemy of the good. The service was simply impeccable. We had a junior suite which had a small but beautifully set out sitting area downstairs and upstairs we had a large and beautifully set out bedroom and ensuite. Unfortunately my partner and I wandered the corridors every time we came into the hotel, like hansel and gretal we were lost almost every time. I am not blessed with a sense of direction at all but my partner is. Of course the staff who are always around are pleased to direct you but if you don't like to ask you will need to…"
January 2016,The best little hotel in London,"Hotel 41 in London has to be the absolute best small hotel I have ever stayed at. The overall ambience is stunning, the staff are amazing - nothing is too much trouble. The room was above expectations - the bed 'perfect'. The location just behind Buckingham Palace made it very easy to get to all major attractions - Victoria Tube station was less than 5 minutes walk. The food was wonderful - especially the 'Butlers Pantry' offering a choice of food through the evening at no extra charge. If you are looking for a truly superior hotel in London, Hotel 41 should be your first choice. As with all hotels, the staff make the experience, and the Hotel 41 staff are truly at the top of the game. Nothing is too much trouble - ask for a hot water bottle at 11.00 at night and it is delivered…"
November 2015,FANTASTIC HOTEL,"A friend and I spent 3 nights at Hotel 41, and we would have happily stayed there for a month.  The hotel is quiet and charming, and on arrival we were sipping champagne on a comfortable sofa, while checking in. The rooms were lovely, the staff was absolutely amazing, and the food was fantastic. I highly recommend this hotel and would love to return."
January 2016,Beyond fabulous,"We have just returned from a night at 41.  What a fantastic experience.  From the moment we arrived to when we reluctantly left we enjoyed every second.  The service is exemplary without being intrusive.  The rooms are fabulous, the little touches make the stay extra special.  Whilst the building and surroundings are wonderful it is the people that work there that make 41 stand apart from other 5* hotels.  I would highly recommend a chat with Steve as he pours you champagne on arrival, great guy. The reception team were so helpful. I can not find a single fault with 41.  If you get the chance to, stay here!"
December 2015,A Perfect Holiday in London,"Our family of four spent Christmas and New Years at Hotel 41 and could not have chosen a better property.  There are so many good things to say about this property, it is hard to know where to start.  The location is great and the rooms are perfectly appointed - everything you would expect from a 5 star property.  The Library (lounge) literally has snacks around the clock and is a wonderful, comfortable place to hang out.  Our family played cards there every night before bed.  It is warm and inviting.  It is the staff, however, that makes the property stand out.  They are helpful and gracious and thoughtful.  From Christmas gifts and stockings on Christmas morning, to an autographed commemorative after we saw Wicked, to assistance with so many other things throughout out stay --…"
January 2016,"Incredible staff, Incredible service","Like all the reviews before you cannot fault the 41. We stayed 3 nights over New Year the rooms are beautifully appointed, the executive lounge is as you see in the photo's, stunning and the food throughout the day excellent. We also tried the bbar next door which is well worth a visit and being from the 41 were treated like royalty, excellent service and very good food. But the Jewel in this crown at the 41 are the staff, I can only say what beautiful people, there's a fine line of knowing how to look after people without being intrusive and this they manage to achieve. I would also like to pay my complements to the one's behind the scenes. Already planning to return."
December 2015,Absolutely fabulous ,"Hotel 41 is an absolutely fabulous place to stay. You are made to feel so welcome as soon as you enter the hotel. I came to stay with my brother and two friends on 31 Dec to 2 January and had an absolutely amazing New Years celebration. All the staff are so lovely, so helpful and absolutely nothing is too much trouble. You feel thoroughly spoilt from the minute you arrive at the hotel. The executive lounge is a lovely place to chill out and enjoy the plunder pantry, which changes throughout the day with all sorts of lovely goodies. I have stayed in several 5 star hotels over the years but I have to say that Hotel 41 tops them all. The attention to detail is simply exceptional, you have to stay at Hotel 41 to really understand what I mean. They really have thought of everything.…"
December 2015,Fabulous from the moment you walk through the door,"I rarely make reviews on tripadvisor, but i thought it was important that i express what an obsolute gem this is, from walking in the door to leaving, nothing is too much trouble. The staff are fantastic and make an effort to introduce themselves, get to know you and they really remember your name, which really does provide the personnal touch that is so often missing in the bigger hotels. The ongoing flow of nibbles/food in the lounge is excellent and literally you can stay there all night and just soke in the relaxed, classy ambiance. As for the room, top notch, again every detail covered. Definitely a 5 star experiance."
December 2015,Our stay was excellent this year!,"We recently returned from a 7 night stay, our third stay at the Hotel 41.  We enjoyed an excellent experience this time and continue to smile over our great memories!  We had requested our favorite room overlooking the Royal Mews and were happy to be staying in that room once again. The room is nice sized and the bathroom with that huge, deep tub is wonderful.   My daughter needs a gluten-free diet and this time the 41 met her needs very well. She was extremely happy with the options available to her this stay and that alone made us both want to return yet again.   We both enjoyed the excellent breakfast offerings each morning. Those Belgian waffles - fantastic!  The dinner and afternoon tea which are included with our Costco vacation package were very enjoyable. Plunder the…"
December 2015,PERFECT in every way!,"After reading tripadvisor reviews, I booked the hotel as a surprise for my boyfriend to celebrate being together for 10 years. From the moment we walked in, we were made to feel that nothing was too much bother and as if we were their only guests. We were greeted with a choice of champagne (to check in with!) before being shown to our stunning room (Monarch Suite) and then spent the evening relaxing in the Lounge. The staff are not only attentive but very friendly in a professional manner. We had a truly magical evening and breakfast was excellent too. Every part of the hotel is pristine and the food is excellent but the people who really make the difference are the staff. For a special treat, book Hotel 41 as you won't be disappointed."
December 2015,"Hotel 41 The best unknown hotel in London, that does the exceptional like no other","For our 2nd trip this year to Hotel 41, Malcon Hendry  and his exceptional team decided to raise the bar on what can only be called sublime,   From the check in ( try it m out of this word )  , to an unexpected upgrade to the conversatoey suite, ( amazing experience )!. 41 ensured the experience was nothing but WOW ,,,,   I asked staff for tickets to Aled Jones at Chrisrmas , at the Albert Hall for a very special treat for my beautiful wife ,,what we actually got, front row seats at the side of the stage , next to Aled , imagine Christmas with Aled ' waking in the air ' Jones , with the greatest eveingi of Xmas you could ask for   41 sorted a reservation of the sky Gardnen, you will never do the shard again   The staff are equesitte , this is service you would always want in…"
December 2015,Perfect Weekend,"From the moment we walked in we felt more royal than the lady who lives across the road! We can only echo other reviews in that the staff are absolutely amazing, nothing is too much trouble. They are very attentive without being at all intrusive and all seem genuinely interested in you. The executive lounge is a haven of peace and tranquillity and the rooms have every comfort you could wish for. The real stand out feature is the attention to detail. This truly is an exceptional hotel."
December 2015,Great escape,Lovely hotel where when you are in the restaurant/lobby or in your room completely forget that the hotel is in the center of busy London. Beautiful interior including beautiful rooms. Very nice and helpful staff. Good breakfast and the complementary snacks and bites (until 1am) are a good reason for drinks in the hotel bar.  Would go again 100%  
December 2015,Brilliant,"Took my husband for his 50th birthday, the service was impeccable, the staff were amazing, we were made to feel very welcome & special. The whole experience was phenomenal & I would highly recommend to others."
January 2016,Fantastic Attention to Detail,"Having stayed in many hotels in London it was an absolute pleasure to find this little gem of a hotel.  From arriving at the front door, to champagne whilst waiting to check in and a room of the highest standard, there is not a single thing that I could think of to improve my experience.  All of the staff made my experience exceptional and the hotel is to be our base for all future London trips.  A great job, well done and many thanks"
January 2016,Fabulous Hotel,"Our daughter booked us in for a night for my husbands birthday in January.  I can't praise it enough. The level of service from ALL the staff was exceptional, lots of smiley faces.  The room and the bed were extremely  comfortable, even rose petals and tea lights when we gotback to the room.  The tea was an added treat, homemade cakes and scones.  Would cetainly make sure to go back again."
January 2016,Delightful Stay!,"This hotel is SO lovely!  I almost don't want to write a review so I can keep it a secret!  It really is a little haven in the heart of London.  I stayed with my mum and we were upgraded  to a suite which was such a treat.  The service levels are superb, without being overbearing.  I have stayed in lots of nice hotels, with great service, but this service was above and beyond. We went out for dinner to the restaurant next door (very nice) but when we got back the surprises kept coming.  Firstly someone had been in, lit the fire and left out a tray of home made petit fours.  Then when we went into the bathroom, a scented candle had been lit and then to top it all , there was a hot water bottle in the bed.  Just gorgeous! I can't wait to stay again....."
December 2015,AMAZING,"My partner & I visited Hotel 41 over the Christmas period to celebrate her Christmas Day birthday and our 20th anniversary, which I mentioned while booking.  What an amazing hotel, we were enchanted. The level of service we received from Team 41 was incomparable.  We have visited many 5 star hotels in Europe and USA but we have rarely encountered such a level of friendly, professional attention as we received from the Team 41 staff.  We were warmly welcomed on arrival with a much appreciated free glass of champagne whilst checking in and when we were taken to our room our bags were already there.  This level of service continued throughout our stay and we were struck by the Team's genuine wish to provide us with a highly comfortable and enjoyable experience.  It was the little…"
November 2015,Great Service but rooms needs some renovations,"This is #1 in trip advisor list and deserved that rankings based on service, amenities, guest service is superb , location is great only comment is rooms needs to be renovated, Concierge helped me to book very good restaurants ."
January 2016,Best hotel we've ever stayed in! ,"We visited hotel 41 on the 16th Jan for my husbands 40th and from start to finish I cannot fault our stay. We stayed in the conservatory room which was a stunning room with downstairs lounge, big bedroom, wonderful jacuzzi bath and a stunning glass roof. The staff made us feel so welcome and made my husbands birthday so special, from the birthday cake in the room to the rose petals and candles in the room on our return (all totally unexpected). This 5 star hotel is welcoming and relaxing without any of the snobbery or up tight feel to other 5 star hotels. Staff are friendly, attentive and warm. We had ample complimentary champagne, delicious canapés and snacks from the buffet. In the evening we had booked a room at la caprice and we were handed a print out of walking directions…"
January 2016,Priceless,Feeling at home when you are not at home... We spent a weekend (first time with our baby) and everything was perfect. The staff was very helpful and we had a very good time. Since a few years Hotel 41 is the place we book when we visit London. It has become like a tradition... Thanks!
January 2016,Best London hotel we've stayed in!,"Hotel 41 is a small hotel on the fifth floor above the Rubens Hotel. Enter by a private entrance and take the lift to the fifth floor reception Executive Room, everything seems so calm and smooth - a million miles from the madness of the big hotel receptions.  No queue, only a flute of Veuve and a smooth registration in a split level library, more reminiscent of a twenties explorers club. Staff universally excellent, friendly without being over formal or familiar. The rooms have a striking contrast of black and white, but it works. Spotlessly clean and well equipped with multiple Loewe TV's and a full Sky channel set viewed in sharp HD - not the typical chain hotel 'mush'. Large beds, crisp white 41 branded bedding, mattress toppers and unobtrusive AC give the best possible…"
January 2016,"Perfectly Exceptional, Balanced Just Right","We found ourselves in a last minuted situation needing to find a hotel while visiting London. Of course checking TA first the obvious choice was Hotel 41. From the moment of booking through departure there was not a weak link in the experience. Having been fortunate enough to stay in many nice hotels in my lifetime, this easily ranks amongst THE best experiences thanks primary to the staff and people that take such pride in this small boutique 5 star hotel. The room, what everyone expects from any hotel, comfortable, warm, well equipped, safe and quiet. The staff, friendly, accommodating, genuine and caring without exception, You feel they really enjoy what they do and are glad you are there.  There is a very comfortable common area that you are taken to when you are checked in…"
January 2016,Perfect from start to finish!!,"I recently celebrated my birthday with a trip to London staying in Hotel 41. On arrival we were warmly greeted by a member of staff, were relieved of our luggage and accompanied to check-in and a welcoming glass of champagne! I know all of this is promised on the hotel's website but the reality is more than expected. I can honestly say this was the warmest welcome I've ever experienced - and I've stayed in many luxury hotels around the world. The difference I think is that the staff appear genuinely happy in their work and that carries through in everything they do. The hotel ticks all the boxes for luxury and service and there is little I can add to hat has already been said in previous reviews. In fact we were so comfortable and cosy on our last evening that we stayed in for…"
February 2016,Brilliant staff,We stayed for my wife's birthday. I love how the staff managed to make us so welcome & so helpful but without coming across as over bearing or too poncy! We're going again for my birthday. It's easy walking distance to the theatre district too.
May 2015,Excellent for Buckingham Palace atea,A haven close to train station.  Chose to stay here because of the connection to Orient Express departure.  Room and facilities were five star.  No view at all though so if that is important to you stay elsewhere.  Review against other five stars as I'm not convinced of value for money.  
January 2016,Outstanding service from an exceptional Hotel,Weekend away at Hotel 41 to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday. Booked based on the really great feedback on trip advisor and wasn't dissapointed. Exceptional sevice from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. Have stayed in numerous supposedly 5 star hotel in the past which have never lived up to their ratting. Hotel 41 not only lives up to its rating but goes beyond it in terms of the friendlyness and proffessionalism of its staff. Best hotel experiance we have ever had!!!!!!!
January 2016,30th birthday visit,"This hotel is exceptional from start to finish. The surroundings are stunning, the staff are fantastic and they go to the next level of detail to make your stay special. The location is also very central.  Hotel 41 made my 30th birthday a very memorable one. If you are thinking of booking don't hesitate, you won't beat this hotel."
January 2016,Why is it number 1?! ,"If like us you're wondering why is Hotel 41 number 1 in London, this post is for you. For a small and intimate hotel this really does set the standard pretty damn high.  Before I get into the details, what I will say is that if you like a pompous atmosphere then you're better off going to the Dorchester or similar.   Here at 41 people will speak to you, people will try and get to know you, to me that is the best part. Everyone is friendly, chats to you, gets to know you and adjust how they approach you and/or set out how to make your stay special, after all, everyone is unique.   For us, it was a birthday treat for my fiancée, on arrival they had made it very personal and special, as soon as we pulled up they whisked our car away and parked it for us and gave us some champagne.…"
January 2016,NUMBER 1 HOTEL... FOR A REASON...,Here it goes... Long story short... My husband surprised me with a visit to his hotel. Didn't know much about it. It was to celebrate our 15th year Anniversary together. Literally from the moment you walk in you have entered a whole different experience. Once you have spoken to the lovely people on reception you are greeted by more staff to take you upstairs where you are sat down by who I presume is the manager. The champagne starts flowing and the staff cannot seem to help you enough! Then the best part of the whole experience for myself and my husband was being directed and shown to your room. We walked in and was blown away. We had a guided tour of what turned out to be the Conservatory Suite which we was upgraded too. Our champagne was already in our room and there was a…
February 2016,Valentine's weekend ,Fabulous hotel and services impeccable great few days . The hotel is in a great location for all things a tourist would be looking for we walked to most places . The hotel is very quite unlike the larger hotels and every member of staff is so helpfull and friendly and the rooms are immaculately clean .
February 2016,Get me out of here!,"Ok, so there is no point me talking about all the wonderful things in this hotel as all the other reviews cover these aspects in great detail.  There is no denying the good points- champagne, lounge, food, beds, showers etc.  However, if you are not used to such lavish luxury think carefully before booking here because the reality of it is somewhat uncomfortable.  Although the staff appear friendly, the conversations are so scripted, at times I really didn't think they were interested in our answers and to be honest, who can blame them...guests really aren't that interesting considering they all probably do the same thing.  When I tried to go back into the hotel in the afternoon I was asked in a rather abrupt way if I needed help. I obviously didn't look like the type of person…"
February 2016,Wow Amazing Amazing Amazing 5* Hotel,"Just returned from a fabulous 3 night stay at this top class hotel to celebrate my husband's 60th Birthday.  Customer service is outstanding, the best we have ever received in a UK hotel. Every single member of staff is truly wonderful, friendly & nothing is too much trouble. Our suite was lovely & very clean. The food is amazing/delicious. We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Thank you again for a very special stay. Look forward to returning at the earliest opportunity."
February 2016,I expect the best hotel in the world...,"Read the other reviews and you'll see the kind of things to expect whilst staying at 41.  Perfect Service Delicious Food Extremely Clean rooms  Nothing is too much trouble and at no point during the stay did any members of staff say ""no that's not possible"" or ""sorry, we can't do that"". The staff do absolutely everything in their power to make your stay perfect. Which I'm pleased to say, they did.  Outstanding."
February 2016,I cannot recommend this hotel enough,"We've just begrudgingly left Hotel 41 and its all round wonderfulness! There's a reason this hotel is no.1.   From the great location to the gorgeous rooms to the simply fabulous staff, everything about this hotel is just sublime. Every single member of staff is an asset to the hotel and the impeccable service it offers.   We stayed here as it was a special trip for my parents and the hotel went out of its way to make them (and me and my husband!) feel extremely special.   The relaxing lounge and the never ending supply of delicious snacks is such that you basically want to spend all day and night in there. The way the team remember who you are and what your preferences are, etc. is the cherry on top.  I could go on and on about how fantastic this place is. All high end hotels…"
February 2016,Outstanding,We recently stayed at 41 in London on our way to Tel Aviv.  We wanted our hotel to be part of  our London experience.  We were searching for a boutique hotel with character that portrays the elegance and proper standards that really represent London at it's finest.  This hotel was absolutely that and more.  Thank you for a fabulous stay!  Great location as well.
January 2016,A must when in London,"I stayed here for my birthday this week. The hotel, staff, service were all exceptional! They cannot do enough for you and the champagne on arrival was fantastic  as were the treats and and canapés. As it was my birthday a cake were waiting in my room and the staff wished me happy birthday on many occasions."
January 2016,Superb,"Stayed here on a recent visit to the smoke for a concert at the O2, chosen really only from other TA reviews. Nothing disappointed, the place is excellent, the staff are excellent and, as previously said by others, everyone goes out of their way to make you feel at home. The buffet spread continually impressed and almost surprised us when it was freshened up after midnight one evening when most places would be thinking about packing away for the evening! Even the hot water system was impressive with the hot water being instantaneous whenever you put a tap on! Return visit? Most certainly whenever we visit London again for sure!"
December 2015,James Bond like feel,Wonderful little hotel within the Rubin's hotel. Was the old ballroom but they converted it to one floor. All the rooms are on the 5th floor so you enter a small door and take the lift up. The rooms surround an executive lounge which is always full of treats and snacks In fact we ate so much from the lounge that it kinda ruined our dinner meals. If you looking for a hotel with plush and big lobby with spas and the like this isn't a ritz Carlton. It's small quaint and they wait on you hand and foot.
October 2015,Exquisite,"My partner treat me to an amazing birthday treat (in December 2014, however, TripAdvisor will only let us go as far back as Feb 2015) that included a stay at this gorgeous hotel! The interiors, rooms, amenities, location, food, service, staff were all exceptional. After being offered hot chocolates (at a door side hot chocolate table filled with many treats such as chocolates, cream, sprinkles, jellies and marshmallows) we were ushered upstairs to their lounge and welcome room to check in where we were also sat down with champagne (Gosset Grand Rose Brut). Our room was being prepare and our bags were taken up to our room so we were then seated by the fire with more pink champagne and some lovely snacks.   Our room was an executive double with stunning and very chic interiors,…"
February 2015,Bank holiday bliss,"We like to see a fair bit of theatre and therefore find ourselves in London on a reasonably regular basis. We have given thought to buying a second home there to allow easier weekends away in the capital.   As everyone knows, property in London is fairly expensive and the costs of acquiring and maintaining a second home would be substantial.   I'd like to tell you that this is not at all necessary as Hotel 41 can cater for all the needs you could consider. It is just so relaxing to stretch out in the executive lounge and know that everything you could want is just one question away. The staff are attentive and friendly without being intrusive or overly familiar. You simply get the impression that they enjoy having guests!   Why would you buy another house or flat when you can…"
January 2016,Quite simply the finest hotel we have ever stayed in,This was our second trip to the 41 and it was absolutely perfect again.  The staff is excellent and the facilities are superb.  It is a very easy walk to Buckingham Palace and other shops.  The only knock might be that the restaurant choices are slightly limited but the hotel makes up for it by having great food and drink choices of it's own right in the hotel.  Without a doubt the best part of the stay is the staff.
December 2015,Home for the holidays!,This was our 4th consecutive Christmas at 41 and it was the best yet. Its a wonderful place and the team are always so friendly with a great sense of fun and genuine care for their guests.  The personal touches an attention to detail are second to none.  We'd always recommend 41 as the best place to stay in London and Christmas wouldn't be the same without a visit!
December 2015,Exceptional Service And Stay,"This was my fourth trip to London, however, on this trip my wife was joining me and this was going to be her first time to London.  With this in mind I wanted to stay at a very refined place that is different from the high-end chain hotels.  So, after some research I chose Hotel 41.    A week out before our trip, the staff reached out to me to make sure our stay would be perfect.  Right after we landed at the airport we were picked up by private drive the hotel set up for us and whisked us away to the hotel in style.  As we arrived the doorman showed up greeted us and took our bags inside.  Once inside we were greeted again by a very friendly member of the staff (all members of the staff were very friendly and ready to help out), who took us up to the Executive Lounge for…"
December 2015,Best place I have ever stayed!,"From start to finish, our stay at 41 was perfect. We did find it a little difficult to find the hotel to begin with as it's quite a small hotel so can get lost next to the grand entrance of the hotel next door. However, as soon as we arrived outside the hotel, a member of the concierge was there to greet us and take care of the parking of our car, the cost of of the parking and valet in total was £35, which we thought was very reasonable for central London.  We arrived 1.5hrs before check in, which of course was our own fault, but the staff were so welcoming and made us comfortable until our room was ready by seating us in the Executive Lounge and offering us complimentary champagne and nibbles.  Although it was no problem for us to wait in the homely but luxurious lounge, the…"
December 2015,Wonderful,"Booked to stay for 1 night at Hotel 41, and the hotel really blew us away. All of the staff members could not do enough for us & it is a wondefully picturesque property. Would recommend this hotel to anyone who's looking tostay in London!"
December 2015,Words can't describe how you are treated in this hotel.,"A very close friend and I were extremely lucky to stay in this hotel in January 2016, I booked the room 7 days in advance for the price of 295 pounds, which, from the reviews I believed to be a reasonable price! We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by one of the nicest hotel workers I have ever encountered, unfortunately his name slips my mind however even his conversation and genuine interest in our situation was comforting and pleasant. We were taken to the executive lounge to check in where we were offered champagne which was complimentary! I was then charged 50 pounds for any items we may use while in the hotel however this was put back into my account promptly when I left the hotel after not using any of the extra items or services on offer. What made this stay…"
January 2016,bubble of luxury,"My boyfriend treated me to staying at hotel 41 and it's an amazing hotel, the staff can't do enough for you and there are lots of complimentary perks, champagne on arrival, canapes, fireplace lit and curtains drawn for your return in the evening being just some of them.  Your in an ideal location for being amongst the tourist attractions London has to offer, but perfectly when you step inside the hotel you can even forget where you are and just enjoy being in your own bubble of luxury.  I highly recommend a visit!"
December 2015,Top place to stay in London,"Hands down, possibly the best hotel I have stayed in. The service is top notch...so welcoming, so helpful, and so professional. The rooms are quiet, clean, comfortable, and luxurious. During my visit, in which I was visiting while my husband was in London for work, the hotel placed us in one of their suites...it was incredible. The food, which we only had breakfast, dessert, and some snacks were good. For my first English breakfast, I loved it. One of the days we ordered a shrimp cocktail for a snack to our room and they came with a different (nicer) shrimp dish than the menu, which was awesome.  The location of the hotel felt super convenient to wherever we wanted to go. It allowed us to easily walk over to buckingham and through the parks to explore more of London.  My husband…"
January 2016,Absolutely perfect!,"We stayed this weekend at this boutique hotel expecting a nice experience a the reviews were pretty good. I have to say that I and my friends were absolutely delighted with the quality of the service and the attention to detail. Rooms where wonderfully and tastefully decorated and any conceivable need was already taken care of.  The food served at breakfast and through out the day was very good. we felt really spoiled and I would like to thank again the staff and their management for such a stunning performance. Please note this is my first review ever!  I have stayed in wonderful hotels in London but so far this exceeded my expectations and this is why I take the time. To conclude, it is a wonderful place to stay while in London for short or long term so go for it any time your…"
October 2015,Luxurious honeymoon!,"We stayed 2 nights at this hotel. From the moment we entered the premise, we were greeted by our names, and refreshments.  My wife got her hot chocolate (Starbucks).  We were then escorted to the Executive Lounge at level 5 to check in.  Upon check in, we were served a glass of champagne and canapés, which were very nice.    The room is big, clean and luxurious. My wife ordered a cycling bike and it was there in the room waiting for us! There was also a personalised card from the hotel and cake for us in the room.   We loved the 'Raid the Pantry' in the Executive Lounge. There you can have as many ice cream, chips, tipbits, cheeses and drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic).  Service was thoughtful and personal. They were always there to help with anything. One thing special…"
January 2016,Truly special,"My best friend and I stayed at Hotel 41 during our week-long trip to London to celebrate the new year. The experience was fantastic from the moment we walked in until the moment we checked out.  We arrived early in the morning on Saturday 1/2, expecting that we would drop off our bags and check in later when our room was ready. We were whisked to the executive lounge, where we were offered a glass of champagne and checked in. Andrew told us that we would have a temporary room to freshen up and relax while our room was prepared. He then proceeded to spend 45 minutes mapping out places to eat and drink while we were in London.   Our room was ready at 1:00 in the afternoon, and it was really perfect. It was nicely laid out, comfortable, and quiet. The bed was excellent, and…"
January 2016,All other hotels bow down to Hotel 41,"We visited here for my fiancee's birthday. It was a stop over while we saw Billy Elliot and did some retail therapy. When we arrived at the hotel we entered the building and proceeded to check in until the receptionist told us we don't have a booking.....I was devastated but luckily she said we are booked in their sister hotel next door. We had used the wrong door and were in the Rubens hotel instead (which loooked very nice by the way). Whoops.....panic over we entered Hotel 41. We were early but this didn't seem a problem for them. We were told to leave our bags at reception and were taken to the executive lounge. The lounge is lovely and a very relaxing place to be in between sight seeing, shopping and seeing a show. There is a complimentary buffet available all day till 1am…"
January 2016,Best of the best,"Many hotels say they have excellent service. This one does. There is a button on the phone console named ""any time/anything."" which says it all. The room we stayed in and the lounge were beautifully appointed.  Food delicious.  We were treated like royalty."
December 2015,Wow! Absolute amazing and fantastically high levels of service!,"Recently stayed here for two nights, we arrived on Saturday around 8pm, taken up to the hotel level (floor 5). We had champaign of our choice while we checked in. We got shown to our room... Absolutely fantastic! A very nice fresh fruit bowl with a bottle of bubbly and a very nicely presented evening turn down. Breakfast both mornings was absolutely fantastic! The best poached eggs I've ever had! Again with a glass of bubbly. The plunder the pantry is fantastic.. Snacks all day.  We even had a few snacks prepared for us to keep us going on our shopping trip. We checked out at 12 but our train wasn't until 8pm... We was invited back after our day out for a drink and snacks before we leave. I've never been to such a well run hotel. Never have I received such high levels of…"
December 2015,Outstanding,"Well where do I start from the moment we walked into the hotel it was absolutely amazing the staff Were very professional and caring, especially Andrew.  The room was beautiful and the little touches in the room with his and her slippers,sweets,fruit and the little elemis gifts each night was just wonderful.  We enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere in the executive lounge you have the right balance for breakfast and then to enjoy a nice glass of champagne and cocktails during the evening.  By far the most amazing weekend we have ever had.  We can't wait to return to stay with you on New Year's Eve for 4 nights.  I have not stopped talking about the hotel and recommended it to everyone"
October 2015,Splendid,"Everything un this hotel is magnificent. The service is outstanding and the location is perfect. But the best they have is the people who work there, all of them are very kind and professional, always ready to solve any problem and arrange anything you could need. The best in London."
November 2015,NUMBER 1 FOR A REASON1,"We have just returned from staying four nights at this, a home from home.  From the moment we arrived, until the time we left we received fantastic levels of service from all the staff we encountered. ALL staff were absolutely brilliant and whilst it may seem unfair to single anyone of them out, we encountered some more than others, by virtue of our time in the Hotel or their duties.  So, Andrew a massive thanks for your service, restaurant and travel tips and for being an all round lovely guy, and Steve for our welcome, champagne and we enjoyed our chat. Anyone reading any review with regard to this hotel should have no doubt that you will be treated to a fantastic experience, the friendliest staff I have ever encountered (even in other 5 star hotels) and an outstanding quality…"
December 2015,Still speechless,Wow. We fell in love with this hotel and did not want to leave. Staff is very attentive and friendly. Rooms are very comfortable. We felt like home! A perfect place to stay for special occasions. We will defintetly come back. The only problem: You will be tempted to eat and drink the whole day.
December 2015,Fantastic place!!! ,"I have just spent 1 night at this amazing hotel for my partners 50th birthday. Hotel 41 is 1st class, amazing service, amazing room, amazing food and great attention to detail. We were delighted with our stay, the staff were so helpful and nothing was too much trouble, with the manager even emailing us before hand to ore warn us of roadworks outside the hotel. Nothing here disappointedThank you so much for making my partners birthday such a special one. I can not recommend hotel 41 enough!! "
December 2015,Best hotel I've ever stayed in. ,Absolutely fantastic hotel. From the moment you arrive everything is taken care of. The staff are very friendly and professional. Could only stay one night in this trip but the next time I am on London I will be staying longer. 
November 2015,Perfection in every detail!,"We stayed here for four nights, as a Thanksgiving getaway.  We were a little self-conscious, not being super 'fancy' people, but we were treated incredibly well by every member of the staff we encountered, and truly had an amazing trip.  The room was amazingly comfortable, the service was incredible, and we loved having cocktails and taking advantage of the 'plunder the pantry' spread in the evening.  I definitely hope to return!"
November 2015,Pleasure before business,Can't say enough about this hotel!  They are spot on with everything!  All the little details - from the welcome at the door with hot cocoa to the hot bag of water to keep the bed warm under the sheets at turn down!  Impeccable!  The staff were all super friendly and very helpful!  
November 2015,Interaction with staff via email GREAT!,"I just wanted to let the Trip Advisor community know about my experience with these guys...My family had scheduled a trip to london as we visit England about 4-8 times a year to ""get away"" and when the Paris terror attacks took place I told my wife to reach out to our reservations to postpone because of the crazy travel situation that was just so fresh. Hotel 41 staff where amazing and took care of canceling the reservation right away with perfect understanding...When we head back to London soon, I will definitely be staying with Hotel 41 for a change. Thanks for seeing the big picture Marlen Wunschel and taking care of your guests! ~Steven"
November 2015,Exceptional in every way,"Beyond the beauty of the hotel and the tremendous care taken in every small detail, it was really the stunning service that set our experience here apart. Without ever being intrusive, they worked to take care of us in every way possible, offering helpful tips, hints (and drinks!) -- and always welcoming us back by name at the end of the day. Given the small number of rooms, they can truly focus on every guest and his/her needs; honestly the service was superior to anything I'd experienced. And the ""snacks and drinks anytime"" policy is of course terrific. I can't recommend staying at 41 highly enough!"
November 2015,Fantastic Anniversary Visit!,"My wife and I have just enjoyed a wonderful two days at Hotel 41 celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary .It is truly a magical place to stay and ranks with any 5 star hotel in the world and we have stayed in a few ! The staff led so ably by Manager Malcolm Hendry ensure you are cosseted from the moment you arrive to the moment you reluctantly leave. Everything is first class but it is the personal touches that makes this boutique hotel so special . As it was our anniversary the staff in the evening had spread red rose petals around our room , lit candles and the fire, provided a complimentary cake and put on romantic music - what a welcome on our return from the theatre.So a huge thank you to everyone at Hotel 41 for making our special occasion so memorable"
November 2015,A 10 STAR Hotel!,"We stayed at the Hotel 41 for six nights. It was the most wonderful six nights in a hotel that we've ever stayed in. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were taken care of with the upmost care, professionalism and comfort. The executive lounge which is open 24 hours a day has delicious food, comfortable seating and the most attentive staff we have ever seen at a hotel. The location is terrific - just a few minutes away from Buckingham Palace! We cannot WAIT to return to London and this magnificent gem!"
October 2015,didn't expect it but wow,"I have loved the place from the the very first moment till we left the place , price paid well deserved   to be honest i didn't expect  to have such a pleasing experience, keep up the good job you do guys,"
November 2015,Excellent Hotel,This was our first stay at this boutique hotel but it will not be our last. The standard of accommodation is very good. All of the staff were very attentive and welcoming without being intrusive. The whole experience from a glass of champagne on arrival through to afternoon tea and then a farewell tea + biscuits was excellent. We have no hesitation in recommending this small boutique hotel.
November 2015,This hotel is better than excellent it's outstanding in every way,"We stayed here to celebrate my partners birthday and we where so happy we did, the customer service at this hotel is outstanding from the second you walk through the door until the second you leave, we sat down at reception and received complimentary champagne which there are four to choose from they explain how everything works and tell you all about the pantry where food is available at different times of the day and night, we where then shown to our room which was an executive king room although in most hotels it would have been classed as a suite as it had a separate seating area with tv phone bose docking station and fridge and mini bar and then down a short corridor there was the sleeping area and bathroom with king size bed another tv with sky and there was also a dvd…"
November 2015,Ruby Wedding Anniversary Celebration,Celebrating our 40th Wedding Anniversary we stayed at Hotel 41 for a weekend from13th - 16th November.  We were very spoilt.    Staff were very helpful and attentive. We felt very comfortable so much so that we have booked to stay again.
November 2015,Taking care of clients,"I have stayed at Hotel 41 often on my visits to London and here are two more reasons why.  1. After a cancelled connector flight to catch a day flight to London I was switched to the next available which was 10 hours later and meant a very early arrival into that city. I e-mailed Hotel 41(after trying unsuccessfully online myself to arrange for a car downtown ) and they had a car and driver waiting for me on arrival at Heathrow.  How pleasant after a long delay and o/n flying.   2.  I arrived at the hotel at 8:30 am and they had my room ready to go despite the fact they were totally booked the night before. Heaven!    As always the service, the ambiance, the food and the attention to detail was at their usual five star standard. I love Hotel 41. If you are looking for a London…"
November 2015,Great hotel!,"I was staying in executive king room for 2 nights. It was a wonderful experience! The hotel was well located just right behind the Buckingham palace and just 7 mins walk from Victoria station. Overall ambience was great, very unique. The room size was acceptable, the decoration was unique, the bathroom facilities was great. I love the mattress and bed linen here, very comfortable. However, my friend  thought that the bed was too soft and she had back pain after our stay but i were totally fine. I also appreciate the hospitality from all the staffs.Everyone were very friendly and helpful. On our last day, we requested late check-out until 16:30. The hotel was very generous in giving us a courtesy room so, we could refresh and took a shower before our long flight back home. So,…"
October 2015,Luxury boutique but pricey,"My husband and took a belated anniversary trip to London for a week last month and we wanted to live it up, so we booked an executive king room at Hotel 41 as part of an American Airlines vacation package.   The cab from Heathrow airport nearly missed the hotel because it's on a busy street with no place to legally pull over and unload. Entering the hotel is like walking into a private home—dark wood paneling, black and white checkered floor, snack and light beverages, candy canes—and the staff is extremely attentive. While the foyer is on the ground floor, the rooms and Executive Lounge are all on the 5th floor. To check in you go up to the Executive Lounge, a gorgeous atrium library that is the ""heart"" of the hotel and where you can have breakfast, snacks, drinks, or just sit…"
October 2015,Wow Wow Wow,We stayed here on Friday October 30th after finishing a 2 week cruise and this was the highlight of our trip.  What a Beautiful hotel and they sure know how to treat there guest.  From the time you check in to you check out everything you could possibly need will be taken care of.  We also loved the 41 hotel because of its proximity to Buckingham Palace.  When we come back to London from Virginia we will definitely stay here.
October 2015,very special hotel even for teenagers,"I was staying at 41 for 3 nights with my 2 teenagers sons. I was al little bit doubtful... But they already miss the hotel. We stayed at several luxury hotels, but this one they liked most: because of the size, because of the atmosphere, the personal attention... The room size was oke for us, room decor very nice, the view depressingly... Unfortunately during early morning and late night we were disturbed.... by the ""talking floors"".....our room lay next to the reception, toilet and an emergency exit....  But.. we hope to come back soon!"
November 2015,How is this #1??,"At time of booking this hotel was number 1 on TA. Foolishly I thought we were in for the treat of a lifetime. Sadly, while this place is very pleasant, in a superb location and very lovely there are many London hotels which would knock it hands down. Staff looked after us very well if in s slightly cloying way. Main problems were the very noisy plumbing and a mysterious red light which prevented housekeeping from servicing the room. (To be fair though they had dropped in a note to ask us to call for service but we returned too late). All in all a good, albeit a little dated, hotel in a very prestigious neighbourhood!"
October 2015,Big birthday stay,"We stayed here overnight on Sunday 25/10/15 and everything I had read was totally true!! I booked it as a surprise for my husband's birthday (along with dinner at Heston's a short walk away - also fantastic!) after reading the fab reviews about its quirky atmosphere, amazing staff and great location. I was not disappointed with any aspect. The booking process was easy, check in was luxurious and a lovely change from the impersonal check ins at other hotels. We enjoyed a lovely glass of champagne then, as the room wasn't ready, which I had been told I advance and was not a problem, e left our overnight bag to enjoy the rest if the day in London.  On returning to the hotel the staff were again wonderfully smiley and attentive, we went to our room - complete with gorgeous treats…"
October 2015,50th Birthday Trip,"My wife had done extensive research on where to stay for my 50th birthday visit and I am pleased to say that she could not have picked a better hotel in the whole of London to spend our 3 days celebrating my 50th birthday earlier this week.  Where to start? Firstly the welcome is unbelievable. You are whisked from a very discrete lobby, via the lift up to the fifth floor where all the rooms are, to the exceutive lounge to check in. You are handed a glass of champagne immediately to help you relax and start to enjoy the stay. The staff made you feel so welcome and at ease - I will return to the staff later, although to call them that does all of them an injustice as they felt like friends!  Our room was stunning and so tasteful. There would be nothing I would change. The food was…"
October 2015,Perfect,"My partner and I stayed here for one night to celebrate our 5th anniversary. It was simply wonderful.   When we arrived we were greeted with champagne and then shown around before being taken to our beautiful room. There was a yummy chocolate cake waiting for us which said 'happy anniversary' aswell as a plate of little treats.   The room was comfy and so nicely decorated. It was a bit warm for us in the room even with the air conditioning on, but we are from the north so it was like our summer in London!   We shared a bottle of wine in the executive lounge and were presented with canapés which were really tasty. After going out for a few cocktails, we went to 'plunder the pantry' which was perfect! We went away with 3 platefuls of food and felt a bit greedy, but the friendly…"
October 2015,An amazing night away!,"I stayed here with my girlfriend for one night last Thursday and we were both bowled over by the Hotel. On arrival we  were escorted to the fifth floor where the reception is and Florent was very helpful and charming providing us with a glass of champagne after our travels. Check in was quick and we got a tour of the Executive Lounge which was very impressive and definitely felt 'exclusive'. The Hotel itself is small but beautifully appointed with gorgeous rooms and you rarely run in to other guests giving you more of an 'isolated' feeling, perfect for us. I proposed to my girlfriend that evening and she said yes and it certainly helped that the hotel turndown service was so impressive with champagne and candles, chocolates, music etc. The honesty bar is very nice too, food is…"
October 2015,A jolly olde week,"We returned 2 weeks ago from a lovely 7 night  stay at the 41 Hotel. The 41 was even better than we had expected  even after all  the glowing reviews we'd read about it. The location was perfect between Buckingham  Palace and Victoria Station.We were minutes from the Underground, but could also walk to many of the major attractions. Our duplex suite was roomy and finely furnished. All the food :  ""raid the pantry"", breakfasts, afternoon snacks including daily treats in the lobby ,wine and cocktails served in the lounge were delicious and signature touches that set this hotel apart., but the real strength of this hotel is their staff. There was no one who didn't seem to enjoy their position or who wasn't knowledgeable, personable and professional. They all worked to make our stay…"
October 2015,A wonderful experience and service that is second to none,"We stayed at this hotel for one night recently to celebrate a big birthday. Like a lot of people, we have been fortunate enough to stay in luxury hotels around the world and I can honestly say that the service here rivals anything experienced elsewhere. It feels a bit of a cliché to repeat the accolades given by other reviewers, but they are completely merited.   The surroundings are beautiful and very relaxing. The staff are attentive, without being fawning or over-the-top, and seem genuinely to be enjoying themselves. Staff who come in for a special mention are Andrew, Steve and Dickson (A true gentleman. ""Tea in the morning, champagne in the evening"" was his motto for our stay, a man after my own heart!), although everyone we met went the extra mile, including one man who…"
October 2015,Terrific!,"We loved this hotel. Quirky, charming and so comfortable.  The entire staff was so professional, upbeat and couldn't do enough for us.  We were also with two other couples and they even gave us our own private room for breakfast each morning. So many little touches and extras were included..  breakfast, tea and mini sandwiches, amazing hot chocolate waiting at the door, candies & ice cream at night, mood sprays at turndown.  It's rare to find this kind of hospitality. Stay here!"
October 2015,Wonderful and unforgettable stay at Hotel 41,"This was our second time at the 41, as we decided to celebrate my 40th birthday there. The staff is really excellent, attentive. They reached out to us days before our arrival to ensure everything is prepared for our arrival. I think its those little details that make a hotel stand out from the rest - they truly make you feel home. The room was beautifully decorated, rose petals, pralines, candles - it was a truly memorable birthday. We stayed for three nights this time, the only regret I have is that we were not able to stay longer, it was hard to leave. I definitely want to come back to the 41 on my 41st birthday."
July 2015,Superb hotel with excellent service,We stayed at Hotel 41 during our honeymoon. We loved our room and the friendly staff. Excellent location and a wonderful experience overall. Complimentary snacks and coffee were nice perks. Very glad that we extended our stay at the hotel.
November 2015,Home from Home,"In November we had the pleasure of returning to Hotel 41 for our sixth visit. This incredible boutique hotel has never let us down. It's uniqueness and classy elegance is obvious from when you pull up to the main entrance. Such a hidden treasure within the bustle of London. From our first visit we have been made to feel that we are truly members of the Hotel 41 family. The black and white decor within the corridors and rooms leaves me feeling as if Alice in Wonderland has tumbled along those walls; that the White Rabbit might run past you on the way to afternoon tea! Followed by the nostalgia of an era long past as soon as you walk into the welcoming heart of the hotel. An eccletic mix of reception, lounge, bar and dining. The panelled walls and fireplace immediately pull you…"
November 2015,The AMAZING Hotel 41 lived up to it's reputation as London's Number 1 Hotel,"A Hotel that provides 24 hours complimentary water, snacks and ice-cream, allowing checkout at 12 AND offering breakfast until 13h00 is a winner in my books!!! When most hotels charge for EVERYTHING, Hotel 41 is a pleasant surprise. There are 28 rooms all on the same floor, including the reception and lounge/restaurant.....in a nutshell the entire hotel is on the 5th floor (split over 2 levels). Everything from the beds to the rooms, to the decor, to the staff to the service was exceptional.  We will definitely be returning! Looking forward to my next visit!"
November 2015,Excellent staff,"Staid here for two nights and one thing that can be said is that this place makes you feel at home! the location is perfect, rooms and facilities are charming though small and there's some good food. Most importantly though, the staff achieves almost perfectly this subtle balance between helpful without being intrusive."
November 2015,Great choice,"It's a lovely, charming boutique hotel located in a heart of London. 5 star hotel that is not pretentious. All is perfectly chosen, decoration is flawless. I think that the strongest point is its staff. Discrete, excellent manners and helpful. Recommend for a romantic getaway in London! "
October 2015,Perfect 60th Anniversary Experience,"I chose Hotel 41 based on the positive and the few negative reviews on TripAdvisor to celebrate my parent's 60th wedding anniversary; the hotel and staff exceeded expectations in every aspect during our six day stay.  I agree with most of the commentary supporting the 5 ""dot"" reviews and will add the photos of the lounge do not capture the beauty of the facility.    From entering the building, I was welcomed as Mr. Robsster and our entire party was treated as royalty throughout our stay.  I will say that the lounge is arranged for couples, however, the staff makes it all works. The staff effortlessly accommodated our party of four and the challenges active 84 year olds experience that us younger folk do not.   Our package included breakfast, an afternoon tea and a three course…"
November 2015,Unique and Cozy Hotel - Fantastic Service and Character,"We spent two nights here to celebrate our anniversary.  The hotel itself is entirely on the 5th floor surrounding a very comfortable executive lounge.  The hotel is small (I believe around 30 rooms). The staff is attentive but not pushy.  Our anniversary was acknowledged by the person who checked us in when we arrived as well as in a card in our room which was nice. We were welcomed with a glass of champagne and there was a lovely fruit bowl in the room.  The room was attractively furnished and also remarkably comfortable.  Not only the bed but the sofa, chairs, slippers and robe were exceptionally cozy.  I have never had such thick hotel slippers!   There is free wifi available in the rooms and executive lounge.  One of the most unique and enjoyable features was the…"
June 2015,Looking forward to returning again...,"Always a pleasure to return to 41.  Whenever we return we are greeted like returning friends.  Although on a busy road the discreet entrance hides an array of stunning rooms and guest areas, wonderful service and a pantry available to plunder until contented.  On our last visit (to celebrate a new job and birthday) we were lucky enough to be able to have an upgrade, and what a suite it was.  The attention to detail they paid us was stunning and appreciated (and was liked by our numerous Friends on Facebook).  The only bad part was having to leave but this was made easier by knowing we will return, and we will."
October 2015,Courteous Staff,"They look after you. We had a couple of minor issues but the way they were dealt with was excellent. A very personal service. The lounge was very good with a permanent buffet, drinks were perfectly served."
October 2015,Perfection on our Honeymoon ,This hotel is even more spectacular then I expected.The accommodations are the best & we have never felt so pampered in our lives. Thank you to ALL of the staff & to the manager that brought me to tears of joy for such hospitality. We will stay here again in our future travels. 
August 2015,Not Possible to Top This Hotel,"Everyone was helpful, the room was a delight, the breakfast excellent, the round the clock buffet marvelous, even the ice cream was different and exotic.  When we went to get in the cab to go to Heathrow, one employee took our luggage and another held an umbrella over our heads!  There are two excellent restaurants on each side of the hotel!!  If you're coming to London, come here!  "
September 2015,"Swans and rose petals, candles on final night!","Hotel 41 is a boutique Hotel on one floor next to (between) Reubens (?) Hotel (4 star?) and a restaurant in Buckingham Palace road. Reception is on ground floor and rooms and the Executive Lounge (meals and snacks) on the fifth Floor. It is 5 star, with very attentive (even flattering) staff. On the final night we impend the room door to find two towel swans snuggling next to the pillows with candles and red rose petals trailing to the bathroom. It is a motif of the owners and their Hotel chain, explained in a leaflet."
September 2015,Great Experience,"From the excellent location to the personalized service, we immensely enjoyed our experience at Hotel 41.  The casual, club like atmosphere with personalized service made us feel like pampered guests.  Dickson was especially a riot! The rooms meet our needs and the bathrooms were very nice. The only hiccup was our final bills for us and our traveling companions were not ready at 4:45 AM when we needed to leave (we had a personalized wake up call and vehicle coming at 4:45 AM to make an early flight out of Heathrow to connect to our cruise ship in Rome) which the hotel was or should have been aware of.  I was able to quickly get my bill taken care of, but the other party was downstairs in the van ready to leave, so they have had to finalize their bill after returning home to the…"
July 2015,Outstanding service!!!!," After our arrival from an overseas flight at 9.30am we expected to have to store our luggage and wait to check in at the usual 2pm, however the hotel check in staff could not have been more accommodating, our room was ready within 30 minutes. During which we could enjoy breakfast in the executive club lounge if we so wished. Our room was extremely comfortable, immaculately clean and tidy. Slightly above average  size and everything needed was to hand. This really was like a home from home with an added bonus of the staff exceeding every expectation, nothing was too much trouble.  Great location too!!! Would highly recommend this hotel."
April 2015,"Perfection, Luxury and Perfect","We stayed here for 2 nights in April. The hotel was amazing such luxury and they even do a turn down service in the evening, breakfast and evening meal was gorgeous. Perfect location and staff are more than helpful."
June 2015,Like A Private Club,"Perfectly located, adjacent to Buckingham Palace, the Hotel 41 feels more like an exclusive private club rather than a hotel. The staff, dressed in formal attire, may at first glance appear stiff and stuffy but in reality are very nice, accommodating, and most anxious to make your stay wonderful. Upon check- in, we were immediately invited to a complimentary afternoon tea in the hotels's ""library"". The library was just as you would expect. An imposing mahogany room with a central fireplace, oil paintings and tapestries. Small tables were carefully set with English china. A cornucopia of tea-sandwiches were offerred to us by an attentive white-gloved staff member. The rooms are all smartly decorated in a handsome black and white motif. The sheets and comforters were soft and…"
September 2015,The Best Hotel,"My wife and I stayed at the ""41"" from 14 September to 20 September. We have done a lot of traveling and have stayed at some great hotels but the ""41"" has to rank as the best hotel we have ever stayed. You will read many reviews on Trip Advisor that say the same thing.The photos that you see on the hotel website do not do the place justice. It is absolutely beautiful. There are only 28 rooms and they are all located on the fifth floor of the building which also occupied by a sister hotel ""The Ruebens"". The location is right across the street from The Mews of Buckingham Place. We walked to the Palace, Parliament, the Horse Guard, the Churchill War Rooms, #10 Downing Street, and some nice local pubs and beautiful parks. Upon arrival, after an overnight flight, we were given a room…"
September 2015,Prepare to be spoiled.,"Hotel 41, located right across the street from the Buckingham Palace complex was the nicest hotel we have ever stayed in.  It is a small hotel with a nice ground floor entrance with all the rooms are all on the 5th floor of a beautifully remodeled older building.  A real King sized bed, fireplace in the room, separate shower and tub.  Everything was first class.  We booked through Costco travel which included an extensive continental breakfast each morning and a free dinner at the partner restaurant next door.  The dinner even included all drinks.  The dining room looks is a beautiful mahogany wood room that looks more like a library in a multi million dollar home than the restaurant.  It is open all day and night with free snacks, meats, cheeses, etc.    One of the most…"
September 2015,Perfect London Hotel,"We stayed for 4 days and never tired of the attentive service. The rooms are well appointed, if quirky in layout. [Each suite has 2 floors]. As we understand it, the ballroom floor of the adjacent Rubens Hotel was renovated by the Red Carnation Group to create a boutique executive hotel. From check-in to executive lounge, no thoughtful touch was overlooked.  The linens and furnishings are of the highest quality. Cleanliness was A++. Service in the 24 hour Executive lounge was impeccable, with excellent breakfasts as well as hors d'oeuvres.   41 surpasses any experience we have had in a hotel. University Hotel and Hospitality programs should require an internship here."
September 2015,Truly a 5 star hotel,"I cannot say enough good things about this hotel, which was one of the highlights of our visit to London.  That is saying quite a bit as we just came from a suite at a luxury hotel in Paris the day before.  Not only is the service responsive, thorough and professional, it is also friendly and personalized.  From the moment we walked in we felt welcomed and at home.  From there, the wonderful staff remembered us by name, what champagne we preferred, what room we were in and how we liked things at breakfast, just by recognition.  The big things are easy for a quality hotel to get right, but it was the little touches that blew us away.  Our room was quite large by European standards.  It had a fireplace, what looked to be original artwork and was dripping in marble and wood...Not…"
August 2015,Amazing Wedding Night!,We spent our wedding night at the Fabulous Hotel 41 and really can't praise them enough. The service really is second to none. From the first greeting to when we left everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful. Without asking they moved us into the conservatory suite which is a stunning room with rose petals everywhere!  Thank you so much for making the night so special... I couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough. In every way they go the extra mile to ensure you have a great stay.
September 2015,Simply the best hotel in London.,"We stayed at 41 for our 10th Wedding Anniversary and were absolutely delighted with our visit. The hotel and rooms were stunning and the staff were beyond compare. There was not one thing that I would change about the hotel. The staff made our special day all the more memorable with lots of extra little touches which elevate this hotel beyond any other I have stayed at. I wish we could have stayed longer! The service is highly personal, without being over-bearing and there is no silly pompousness that you sometimes get at other hotels. I can't wait to go back!"
September 2015,Birthday treat. ,Amazing hotel. It's small and the rooms are not big either but everything had been thought of. Staff amazing and well trained. Not stuffy or pompous. Really welcoming especially with our four year old who was a bit of a handful on occasions. All staff exceeded expectations and nothing was too much trouble. Well done guys :0)
September 2015,"Wonderful hotel, top notch service","We just checked out of this beautiful hotel.  The staff was very attentive.  The executive lounge is a nice touch.  A great place to sit, relax and enjoy a drink.  The ""raid the pantry"" snacks are fabulous. We loved this hotel.  The staff was so friendly and helpful.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because our room wasn't made up until 5pm the first day.  We put our sign out everyday after that for it to be done earlier and it was.  The bathroom sink and tub did not drain well at all and kept threatening to overflow.  Just small things like that, but at that price we felt it should have been taken care of before our check in.   I would definitely recommend it though and I would stay there again.  They were very accommodating and gave us an early check in as well."
September 2015,Amazing!,"The only bad thing about staying at Hotel 41 is that every hotel after that will never be as good. Our stay here was simply amazing.. We didn't want to leave! The staff is very friendly and professional and go above and beyond to accommodate your every need. The champagne upon arrival, the executive lounge pantry, the delicious breakfast, the afternoon tea, the sweet anniversary cake, the rose petals and candles turn down service are just a few of the wonderful things this hotel has to offer... they honestly make you feel like royalty with no detail going unnoticed. Perfect location for touring the city. Loved our stay here.. Can't wait to go back! "
September 2015,One of the best ,I can not say enough about this establishment. It is truly an excellent hotel. The staff are exceptional and anticipate every need - even the ones you didn't know you had. This was my husband and my second stay but our first international trip with our toddler. The staff treated our daughter like a princess. It was a fantastic trip and we will return. 
October 2014,Elegant and quiet ,"High class hotel in excellent location adjacent to Buckingham Palace.  Keep your eyes peeled...have passed many celebrities on the street near this hotel.  Delicious food, lovely breakfast room and restful classic wood-panel lounge for a cocktail or nightcap.  Nice staff.  Fresh fruit in the lobby.  A luxury, but worth it. "
September 2015,Amazing.,"My stay at this hotel was unparalleled. The service was sublime, and the breakfast was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend checking out the bar in the evenings, having a late night ice cream after you've come back, and chilling out around the fireplace.  41 was the perfect stay. Couldn't have been better. I won't be staying anywhere else in London."
August 2015,Nice and good location,"I stayed here for a workation a couple of weeks a go, verry pleased with my stay but was hoping for better breakfast alternatives. Good location, nice rooms and friendly personel. I would say you won't be disapointed."
October 2015,Best service I've ever experienced,"Would like to thank all the staff at Hotel 41, for making our visit the most memorable hotel we've stayed in. The customer service is second to none! Absolutely flawless.  The conservatory room was mind-blowing. A roof that opens above the bed, truly one of a kind! I gave no instructions, except mentioning that we were celebrating our anniversary - so what the staff created was unbelievable.  Champagne, a fruit basket and a signed cake on arrival. We left, unannounced, to see a show, and upon returning to our room we discovered that it had been covered in rose-petals, had candles lit, and classical music playing. It was incredibly romantic and the thought and care that goes into the running of this place is just amazing. Breakfast was also delicious and well prepared.  I am a…"
October 2015,Truly amazing,"We were lucky enough to be treated to an evening stay at the amazing 41 , The Staff are exceptional in every way and the hotel has truly got to be the best we have ever stayed at,   The food on offer through out the evening and breakfast were of the highest quality as was the whole experience ,  If you get a chance spoil your self or some one special you would not be disappointed"
October 2015,Special stay in a special place,"My wife and I stayed in London one night on the way back to the states. We picked Hotel 41 based on TripAdvisor reviews and were not disappointed. It's hard to tell how special the hotel is based on the website and reviews. It is completely like a club atmosphere and not a hotel. All the rooms are on the same level (5th floor). The common space is an executive lounge that is intimate, comfortable and inviting. All of the staff seem to go out of their way to know your name, attend to your needs and make sure you are more than satisfied with your stay. We found Flo, in particular, to offer exceptional service. Checking in with a glass of fine champagne and enjoying mimosas for breakfast was fabulous. We didn't see any children, but the hotel assured us they love children. If you…"
October 2015,Great stay,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel 41 in early October, 2015.  It was like staying in a private home with concierge service.  There is a common room which serves breakfast and tea as well as complimentary food throughout the day until 1 a.m.  The staff was very helpful in arranging dinner reservations, obtaining theater tickets, providing directions and information. Also, because the hotel is small  the staff knew who you were and  provided personalized service. The rooms are cozy and comfortable"
September 2015,An Amazing Birthday Present!,"I booked a room at Hotel 41 for the night of my birthday on account of the excellent reviews and was not disappointed! From the moment you arrive, to the moment you leave, you feel like you're part of something special. I've stayed in a number of 5 star hotels in London, which don't compare to the experience at Hotel 41. Staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough for you. I enjoyed the champagne on check-in and the canape's on offer. It was enough food that I didn't need to have dinner. I was fortunate enough to receive a complimentary upgrade to a suite which to my surprise contained a lovely birthday cake and desserts! I appreciated having the Nespresso machine, as well as the fabulous toiletries and slippers. I unfortunately missed out on experiencing 'plunder the…"
October 2015,Absolutely perfect,"If you are visiting London for business or pleasure, be sure to stay at this hotel. It offers everything your heart desires: Very nice and courteous staff. Extremely clean, nice and spacious rooms for London. A great concept with a private lounge and very tasty afternoon and evening snacks. The location between victoria station and Buckingham Palace is perfect for exploring London."
August 2015,It was a fantastic stay!,"It was a fantastic stay in 41 hotels. All of the staffs from reception to manager are very friendly and kind and professional! The services there is perfect! I received the magazines what I like when I request in check-in time! The brunch we ate in lounge but because we waited for a while, it changed to be complimentary gift, which surprised us! Even in dinner, they switch my main course due to I just said it was different than I though, therefore they gave me one what I expect! Endless memorable details brought to me! I strongly recommend this hotel to those who loved nicely British decoration and pay attention to staffs services. I could say it's most personalized services in my life! More than 5 stars! Hopefully we could be back there very soon! By Mr Yuan and Miss Chen"
September 2015,First Class Service,"Hotel 41 is first class in all aspects but particularly the service delivered by each and every staff member we had the pleasure to deal with. We have stayed at a lot of top-end hotels where service is great but this hotel is exceptional. From attentiveness to every detail of your stay, to knowledge of London and things to do, to everything else in between. Nothing was too much trouble.    Excellent location, close to all the best parts of London. Loved the hotel decor, the quirky artwork especially.  We were sad to leave. Definitely worth paying extra to stay here."
October 2015,Great stay at Hotel 41,"Great location (Victoria Station), great staff, wonderful service. The quality / price ratio is often terrible in London hotels but that's not the case here. Cozy, elegant atmosphere with excellent personalized service. I was travelling for business and was happy to have such a lovely, friendly hotel after a long day of work and travelling."
October 2015,Service was spectacular!,"There's nothing the staff could've done to make us feel more welcome.   Everyone was always smiling, they called us by name and were very engaging. We mentioned that we were going to see Billy Elliot and they even got us a program to enjoy before the show!  Thank you everyone!!"
November 2015,"Live like a Queen!! (And King, too!)","Stayed three nights here. Literally next-door to Buckingham palace. Five minute walk to Victoria station.  I wasn't due to check in until 16 November, but I was caught in Paris during the bombing on November 13. I decided to change my plans and had to London a day early and they were happy to accommodate me.  They want her gracious and helpful. I was traveling with a fractured foot, and they helped me out getting around.  The accommodations were luxurious and relaxing. Exactly what I would expect from a five star hotel. The service was impeccable, and the food was delicious. They had a complementary evening snack bar,which was complimentary.   Definitely a great way to treat yourself when you're in London"
November 2015,Lovely place,"This was my second stay here, this time with my mum as she was celebrating her birthday, it's in a great location 5 minutes walk from Victoria so it's really easy to get anywhere. The room we had was a duplex which had a lovely sitting area with a TV and comfy sofa downstairs and the bedroom upstairs, there was plenty of space in the bedroom, with a large wardrobe and a bathroom with a separate shower cubicle as well as a bath. There was an enormous bowl of fruit in our room when we arrived plus a birthday cake for my mum which was yummy, you also get a glass of champagne as you are checking in which is a nice touch. My favourite thing about the 41 is their ""raid the pantry"" service which they have in the evening, we had spent a long day on Friday at the good food show so didn't…"
November 2015,As Advertised,"They have an extension on the room phone labeled ""Whatever Whenever"". This in essence describes the level of service at Hotel 41 London. The entire staff was truly exceptional. If you want to be treated the way everyone should always treat each other, then this is the hotel for you."
November 2015,Brilliant Service exceeded expectations.,"The Hotel 41 is a decadent property minutes away from Buckingham Palace, Harrods, pubs and restaurants.The accommodations and surroundings are as expected for a hotel at this address, but the staff and management are superb. The service was outstanding,attention to detail;impressive and the custom made treats and snacks; delicious. Steve Jones, in particular, was brilliant. We followed his schedule to ensure the stay of all 8 of us was perfect. He suggested shops, places to eat, shared in the laughs but truly never lost sight of the service level expected. We will return because he was the difference. The Hotel 41 exceeded expectations."
November 2015,Brilliant,"Couldn't have been better, would recommend to anyone who wants to have a great time.  Staff was really friendly, food great, cocktails are great and I love the fact the you have access to the executive lounge. Overall would defiantly come back again"
November 2015,truly superb,"Given all the excellent reviews, expectations were high and yes, 41 and the team delivered. Even before we arrived we got help in making some difficult to get dinner reservations, once we were there we were taken care off so well we did not want to leave. Location great, lounge so welcoming and comfy, coming home to the logfire and rose petals in the room was almost too much :-) and we loved plunder the pantry for an inbetween snack. Overall truly superb!"
November 2015,"Wonderful, wouldn't stay anywhere else in London","Second time back at Hotel 41 and won't be our last. The rooms are beautiful but it's the staff who make this hotel so unique with their warmth and charm. They really can't do enough for their guests, highlighted perfectly by the "" whatever, whenever"" button in the rooms! Amazing!"
December 2014,The most amazing hotel in the UK,"One of the best hotels you will ever stay in central London  Not only the best in London but probably the best you will ever stay in FACT  Staff were awesome, food next level... And I cannot stress just how fabulous this hotel is...  From an exquisite interior and lounge area to Buffett food options...  Hotels suites are about average for London at £500 a night but room service at 2am for a chap that wanted a burger and chips after a night out on the town...  Could not be more accommodating and a rare find in central londom"
November 2015,Lived up to expectations,We spent 4 nights at Hotel 41 to celebrate my 50th birthday. Firstly the location is perfect - a few minutes to walk to Buckingham Palace (we wandered along and saw the changing of the guard by accident!) and a 20 minute walk to Piccadilly Circus.  The staff was fantastic - friendly and helpful.  The room although not big was so comfortable and the best equipped room I have ever stayed in - if you needed it the chances are it was there!  The executive lounge was where everything happened!  The breakfasts were lovely although we stuck with the continental 2 of the 4 days as there was a great choice and we took full advantage of the 'plunder the pantry' one evening - we had eaten in a Michelin star restaurant the evening before and my other half actually thought the hotel food was…
November 2015,Perfect for families!!,"First, i should say that i traveled with my wife and our one year old toddler (sofia).  We have been to all kind of luxury hotels (al maha, conrad maldives, etc) and this is one is one of those. You can say, that it's different, i agree, but still a luxury resort.  Even though you do not have amenities such as pool, spa, etc, their first amenity is their hospitality, second their attention to details and third their service.   It was our anniversary, and they not only provided a cake but they also decorated our room with candles and rose petals.  Service. Whenever we wanted a reservation we contacted front desk and they did all reservations for us. That's a big plus. Whatever we needed for our baby they provided in matter of seconds.   Room: its a big size room, with an…"
October 2015,Perfection ,"I was in town for 24 hours and this property is perfection.  It starts with a champagne greeting at check-in, yummy snacks, truffles in the room and lush linens and pillows for a restful evening.  Really a lovely experience and I think we'll stay longer next time."
September 2015,Best place to stay ,"Came here for my birthday, me and my friends stayed for 2 nights and it was perfect! The staff where so helpful and lovely! Also the food was amazing! We had no problems here and we will definitely come back when we are next in London, the room sizes where nicely sized too. "
October 2015,Absolutely phenomenal.  We had a few minor issues which were promptly addressed.,"Location: Fairly central from as little as I know of London and only a 5 minute walk to the Victoria underground and train stations.  The choice of restaurants seemed to be OK.  Accommodations: The building is certainly old but the rooms are very spacious (stayed in an Executive King).  The beds were very comfortable.  The bathroom was a decent size as well.  We had a few problems with our TV not working in the bathroom, however, no big deal.  They were able to fix it  after a couple of days.  Our sink and bathtub were slow to drain.  They were able to fix the sink and offered to swap rooms due to the tub drain, however, we only had one more evening and didn't want to bother.  Other than that the room was great!  Food and drinks: The executive club was great and the food was…"
October 2015,A VERY SPECIAL PLACE TO STAY IN LONDON!,"This is our third stay at Hotel 41 and it has never disappointed us.  We stayed six nights in the end.We love staying here. It is a very special place to stay, the ambience, the friendliness of the staff and the high quality of all amenities provided.Hotel 41 is so close to everything you want to do in London - exceptional accommodation.  The breakfasts are simply amazing, the snacks sensational and most of all the caring attitude of the staff at Hotel 41 make this a great place to come back to after a busy day in London.  I was put in hospital for three days and the staff were amazing & caring to my husband & daughter - we can't thank you enough.  It was so good to come out. This is our third stay at Hotel 41 and it has never disappointed us.  We love staying here. It is a very…"
September 2015,Geat Location and atmosphere!!,"Geat Location and atmosphere!!  Great service all over the Hotel !!! Thanks to the concierge for all the support. Services and facilities are perfect, Decor superb.  Attentive staff and corteaus   Recommended 100% "
October 2015,A perfect place!,"Five nights at Hotel 41 were not enough!  Everything about this little jewel was perfection.  The staff was amazing, the setting was perfect and the rooms were fabulous.  The location was directly across from the Mews at Buckingham Palace...great to watch a parade!  We will be returning for our next trip, with out a doubt."
October 2015,The finest service I have ever experienced,"I have stayed at Mandarin's, Peninsula's, Four Season's, Ritz, etc. and the attitude and service of the team at Hotel 41 made those other wonderful hotels seem like a Holiday Inn.  The common room, where food and drinks were available all day long made it feel like you were staying in somebody's home.  There were three couples vacationing together and this room and the service offered there made it an incredible experience."
October 2015,AMAZING 5 STAR & LOCATION,WOW the location does not get better then directly across from the Palace and the staff are all beyond 5 star if that is possible yes its small and reserved and cozy and quaint and that is what we are paying for its pricy but goes the xtra mile in all areas try the champagne its served 24/7 great fireplace room for breakfast and thru out the day and evenings are relaxed and very British warm by the fireplace and great staff to cater to your every whim & more: for me being on a solo adventure to London i felt very catered and nurtured by all: thanks Antonio CEO/ PRES /
October 2015,"So very, very perfect....","We stayed in Hotel 41 last weekend for 2 nights, and all I can say is, perfection. From the minute we stepped through the door to the time we left, we loved every minute. The attention to detail and the impeccable staff made this hotel such a special place. It was so much more than we expected and we will defiantly be back! Steve Jones needs a special mention, such a character and a real credit to the hotel. I could go on and on.....but do not hesitate to book this hotel, it's a real find."
October 2015,My Dad loves this place,We as a family love to come here and we love this place is always the best place to stay in London. The services are great it's pure luxury... My dad loves the location so not many Saudis stay which is a plus point to my dad lol. Every is great room service is so fast no messing around............
September 2015,are you looking for something special?,"Look no further. 41 will surprise you, every step of your stay. That starts at the intriguing entrance of this hidden gem. It continues on check-in, or should I call it royal reception, and of course includes your room. But most of all it is the overwhelming hospitality you will encounter. Should you then be as lucky as I was and be served by Dickson, then you will truly experience what it means to feel at home away from home."
September 2015,This is way beyond 5 stars!!!!,"OMG! Hands down the best lodging experience by far! I don't think I can be satisfied by another hotel ever again. Just stay here for a night and you will know. From the second you step in to the hotel from every interaction with their staff to everything you see, feel, taste, smell and experience is planned perfectly town to a tee. Boy do they have housekeeping down as an art. The food, snacks and tea there are also amazing! We tried all sorts of highly rated restaurants in London but at the end we felt nothing beats our own hotel's complementary offerings! You really feel like you are royalty, it is worth every penny."
May 2015,ABSOLUTELY OUSTANDING!!!!,"Oh my where do I start!  We spent our wedding night here and got upgraded to the most amazing Conservatory suite....it took our breath away!!  From the moment we checked in we were treated like royalty, such friendly staff who chatted and asked us about our day, champagne on arrival, chocolates and fruits in the room, rose petals on the bed and and jacuzzi bath run for us at night with floating candles  This has to be one of the BEST hotels I have ever stayed and I will certainly be returning, as for recommending I am not sure I can do that as I want this little kept secret all to myself :-)  Keep up the amazing work Hotel 41 you are truly the best"
September 2015,Royal treatment,"Beginning at the less-than-grand entrance, then stepping inside into the small but beautiful downstairs lobby, you have no idea of what awaits you upstairs. It only gets better and better, believe me. Our room (Executive King) was spacious by European standards, well appointed with ample closet space, lovely bed linens, quality vanity items, and spotless bathroom with shower and separate large bath tub.  The lounge and dining area was very pretty with plenty of tables for meals and comfy seating arrangements for conversation and cocktails. It was a pleasant spot with first-class service.  The concierge was helpful in arranging tickets to various attractions and plays, along with directions to walkable sites. Overall we were thrilled with our good fortune to have picked Hotel 41…"
September 2015,The best ever!,"We can't say enough about the Hotel 41.  Between the fabulous rooms, the best shower, ""plunder the pantry"" and the best staff ever, I don't know how to keep my praise to a few sentences.  Just let me say, if you stay here, you won't be disappointed."
September 2015,A Different Twist,"Perfectly located (along side of Buckingham Palace) this hotel offers superb service and a lot of it.  We had been traveling for two months and had stayed in many 5 star hotels during this trip, but ""41"" is a step above.  Love the fact that there are only 22 rooms & 6 suites and love, love, love ""raid the pantry"".  Having met friends for late lunches two days and the theater another evening, all we needed was a little bite in the evening and ""the pantry"" was there for us.  It was a perfect way to end a 2 month trip.  However, now I'm spoiled; I can't imagine staying anywhere else when visiting London."
November 2014,Perfection!,Best hotel we have ever stayed at by far. The hotel is pricey but the service is excellent! We have already booked our trip again for this year. Stayed at many 5 star hotels before and the uniqueness of the boutique along with the welcoming service does not compare! 
September 2015,Best hotel ever!,"We stayed one night at hotel 41. It was the last night of a 'once in a lifetime' holiday to celebrate being with my wife for 30 years and our upcoming 50th birthdays. We had taken the Orient Express to Venice which was opulent beyond our wildest dreams. We then relaxed in Venice for 2 days, afterwhich we returned to London to finish off with what we hoped would be a lovely stay at the hotel 41...but it wasn't lovely....it was fantastic... The best hotel I have ever stayed at....from the doorman to the manager to the waiters and waitresses.... They made us feel special. If I could repeat this trip again, I would start with a night at the hotel 41, go on the Orient Express then come straight back to stay at the hotel 41 again. Thank you for putting the icing on the cake that was…"
September 2015,Overwhelming,"We recently stayed at Hotel 41 or our 10th anniversary. We would like to thank the entire team for making our stay such an amazing and unforgettable event. Everything was taken care of for us extremely well. All the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We would like to especially thank Mrs Monika Skrzynska for her care and detail, she made sure everything was set for our celebration throughout the entire time of our stay.  We stayed at the conservatory suite and our room was prepared in such manner, that we couldn't have asked for anything more.Comparing this to other luxury hotels we have stayed at we were extremely impressed. We will always remember our celebration at Hotel 41 and return in the future."
September 2015,Always exceeds expectations,This is the only place we stay in London.  They have truly exceptional service and the rooms are all wonderful and unique.  They never fail to surpass our expectations on each visit.  We look forward to visiting again each time we return.
August 2015,Just amazing!,"i booked this hotel as a surprise night away to London for my husband. We were not disappointed. On arrival we were greeted with a glass of champagne (and when that was finished offered another!). We had nibbles whilst we waited for our room to be ready, which was only 5 minutes. The staff were really friendly, nothing was too much trouble. If you want posh then this hotel delivers this experience, but if, like us, you like elegance but also not to feel like you have to stand on ceremony you can have this experience too. We felt comfortable, relaxed but with luxury too. The staff are more than happy to offer you ideas of what to do whilst you are staying.  There was always food and nibbles that we could help ourselves to in the reception area. Gorgeous little bags of sweets,…"
September 2015,25th wedding anniversary,"First of all I'd like to start with the positives the  welcome was absolutely amazing nice choice of champagne on arrival , check in very smooth had some nice scones on arrival from plunder the pantry . Went to our room which was small but perfectly formed and they left a lovely cake for our wedding anniversary . Went and had a wander around  we live in London only about 20 minutes away from the hotel and this was just a treat for our 25th wedding anniversary we normally stay in the Goring or Claridges , so this hotel has a completely different feel to it because it is a small boutique hotel . When we had showered and had a rest we went in to have some canapés before going out for dinner this was the highlight of our visit very accommodating too our older children . Breakfast…"
January 2015,Prepare yourself for a stay at the coziest hotel in London :),"My wife and I decided to treat ourselves to a one night stay in Hotel 41, it was absolutely lovely.   The staff were brilliant, the room was so soft and cosy, and it was only a couple of hundred meters from Buckingham Palace.  If you really want to treat your lady then this is where to take her in London."
September 2015,The experience just gets better,We have been lucky enough to stay in quite a few 5 star hotels over the years and none surpass the 41 experience. 41 have once again made a special occasion feel even more special. Many many thanks to Lauren and the wonderful team at 41. We will be back!
September 2015,New FAVORITE hotel in London,"My husband and I have been to London numerous times. Never have we been so ""wowed"" by a hotel as by their check in.   There is only one floor to this hotel near Buckingham Palace. At first they escort you to the 5th floor and then they introduce you to their Executive Lounge.   I was astounded. The service is 6 Star service. You feel welcomed from the moment you arrive. The environment is posh and inviting and Monika was delightful. They have a full bar of drinks, snacks and an ice cream and chocolate bar. I cannot recommend this hotel enough and wish I had found it sooner."
August 2015,Favorite hotel in London,This hotel is exquisite. The staff are so helpful. When you travel from the states it is early morning when you arrive. i was offered a room to rest until my real room was available. When i purchased an electrical appliance that was going to need an adaptor for US use they insisted I take one of theirs. Restaurant choices were excellent. i travel yearly to London and will never stay any place other than here.
August 2015,A perfect oasis in the big smoke,"Having read the many positive TripAdvisor reviews, we decided to pay 41 a visit to celebrate my Mum's 'significantly special' birthday. With high expectations, this amazing property did not disappoint in any way! The service is impeccable; staff are brilliant with phenomenal attention to detail, making every moment you spend there important and special - without being in your face and annoying. The breakfasts are top drawer, great choices of continental and hot made to order. The afternoon tea was sublime, and we definitely took advantage of the wonderful supplies stocked in the larder. This boutique hotel is a must visit property in London - you won't be disappointed. We will definitely be back!"
April 2015,Very thoughtful!,"Stayed here on our honeymoon - the second week of our two-week trip.  When we arrived to our room after our first day exploring, we opened the door to a room full of rose petals, candlelight, and champagne!  It was a lovely touch.  Wonderful service, but I will say that for the price, I think we would have preferred a larger hotel with more going on.  It is a lovely place, but we found the staff to be a bit confused when we asked questions about getting around the city.  Also, the ""raid the pantry"" was nice, but not something we typically were in need of after a day and night in a city full of options.  It was clean, however, and the rooms well-appointed.  Nice breakfast, we liked the location right near Victoria station and across from Buckingham.  Quiet and romantic."
August 2015,Wonderful Celebration,"We have just returned from a 2 night stay at Hotel 41 to celebrate 30 years together. We had previously enjoyed a superb stay there celebrating our silver wedding anniversary in 2013. We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. The staff, without exception, were incredibly professional whilst maintaining a warm, friendly and welcoming attitude. We felt completely relaxed and very well looked after. In particular we were attended to by the lovely Gina who was attentive and wonderfully engaging. Little touches, such as rose petals and candles, and a celebratory cake left in the room really made it a special stay.  We are looking forward to returning for our next celebration."
December 2014,Bob and Pam ,"Wonderful hotel.  Outstanding in every way, food, staff, rooms.  There for Christmas Day and hotel had a tree in our sitting room and a stocking on our couch when we returned from Christmas eve dinner. Caution this hotel is about intimate quality, there is not a sports bar or a pool slide, in fact there is not a pool.  Just a elegant experience.  "
July 2015,Simply Outstanding! Second time running!,"Having stayed twice now at Hotel41 my first review was appropriately titled 'Simply Outstanding!'. Second time round, it's still Simply Outstanding!  One of the best Hotels I have stayed in to date and truly deserves the #1 ranking for London.   I really can't fault this Hotel, it's perfect in every way and delivers on ALL levels and exceeds expectations regularly.  Hotel41 has that personal touch in everything they do which is evident in the way the staff engage and look after their guests which is what has us coming back for a second time and for future Holidays in London! The Food & Drink are presented & served to such a high standard whether it be Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner or a snack / take away drink along the way. The Pantry is always incredibly well supplied and no request…"
July 2015,Really simple - just book it.,"I'm not going to rehash the standard Hotel 41 review - because if you've read more than a couple of pages you'll pretty much have got the gist by now. Ignoring the odd (in every sense) reviewer who wanted the sky a little bluer - I guess that you'll be struck by the superlatives people tend to use in the descriptions of their experience and the emotional connection they seem to have with the hotel. I'd echo this - they were an absolutely integral part of making my wife's 40th birthday celebrations really special - so thank you to all of the team.  If you need it in terms of benchmarks - we have been really fortunate to stay in a number of 5 star hotels acoss the globe Shangri-la, Four Seasons, Fairmont etc and also the current No 3 in the TA top 25 in the UK (Rudding Park) and I…"
July 2015,Perfection,From the moment I walked in a could tell it would be a pleasant stay.   First thing they did was offer me some champagne while they explained the afternoon snacks setup.   The executive lounge was a great little cozy place to relax after getting in or before heading out.   Our room was very nice.  Spacious and clean.   The best thing about the hotel is their staff.   They all know you by name and bend over backwards to make sure your stay is as pleasant as can be.    There is no wonder this hotel is rated number 1; they definitely deserve it.  
July 2015,"Brilliant birthday treat, which was made by the truly wonderful staff, service and impeccable food and drink!","We stayed at Hotel 41 for a wonderful birthday surprise!   We arrived and were greeted with a beautiful glass (or two) of gorgeous champagne, and made to feel welcome in an instant! It is clear that the staff all love this place and their passion for service and hospitality is instantly apparent.  An upgrade on our room was just amazing and the room and facilities were first class! The bed, the bathrooms and complete ambience of this hotel makes it like a home from home, with all the luxury additions that you would expect from a hotel of this class.  All of our needs and expectations were met and exceeded! I cannot explain how wonderful this hotel is! A real experience!  Many many thanks! We will definitely be back!"
July 2015,Pampered,"We spent four wonderful nights at hotel 41 earlier this week. I can't say enough about how professional their staff is. They found a way to promptly satisfy every need and request we had, regardless of the time of day. We were two blocks from Buckingham Palace and treated like royalty.A unique experience. We will return there on our next trip to London. Truly a 5 star experience."
July 2015,The Best Of The Best,We stayed at Hotel 41 for two nights and this was the second time we have stayed at Hotel 41 in less than a year.  It is by far the finest hotel we have ever stayed at.  The staff is superb and takes care of everything and really goes all out to make every minute at the Hotel very special.  They are just so very friendly and attentive and I cannot think of any hotel that excels as much as this one does.  We enjoyed it so much we plan to be back next year.
July 2015,'Best Hotel experience by far',"Its difficult to find words to describe this hotel, as none i can think of are good enough. this was my 2nd visit and hopefully not my last. this time i brought my mum and sisters. The whole experience from the time we arrived to when we left was nothing short of amazing. ALL the staff treat you as if you are their most important guest, however a special mention must go to Lauren and of course Dickson, who just made our stay even more perfect. The Champagne afternoon tea was to die for. one of our party needed a special diet, all the staff were aware of this and we didn't need to ask, she had a separate afternoon tea that looked just as lush as ours.it is all the little touches that make this hotel the top hotel in London, (and beyond) it is everything in all previous reviews…"
July 2015,"Sorry, I didn't feel the love","I booked two rooms for my family of six at the Hotel 41. I chose this hotel based on the fabulous reviews posted here on TripAdvisor. Unfortunately, I didn't find that I was treated any better here than any other five- star properties I have stayed. I thought what set this hotel apart from other high end properties was the extra special personal attention one receives. My family and I were treated with kindness, and everyone was friendly and polite, but no extraordinary treatment was ever given. My family was celebrating my daughter's wedding and my husband's birthday. There was never any mention of this at the hotel. When I returned to the hotel from my outing, I struggled getting my granddaughter's stroller up the steps to the elevator. No one was around to help. I told the…"
July 2015,1st Class Hotel,"What a fabulous time I have just experienced at Hotel 41.  Their customer service is exemplary, and if you are lucky enough to stay at the hotel when Mr Jackson is on duty, then you will have found the jewel in your crown.  Hotel 41 is the perfect place to unwind and relax, it does not feel like a typical hotel, it feels more like being a member of an exclusive private club.    I cannot speak highly enough of Hotel 41 and their fabulous team, if you want to feel like royalty then this is the place to stay!  Breakfast is highly recommended.    Enjoy!"
May 2015,Simply stunning...x,"This hotel is pretty much as close to perfect as you can get. Unfortunately my stay was only one night but it was the most amazing evening and I wish I could have stayed longer.   From the minute you walk through the door you are treated like royalty, Roberta at reception was so kind and sweet. Manager Remus is a true gent, charming and professional, he lead us through to the lounge where we had a quick glass of champagne before he showed us to our room. The room was elegant and stylish, bed so comfy and bathroom stocked to the max with gorgeous toiletries.   We had breakfast in the morning in the lounge which was yummy, Dickson our server is probably the sweetest man on earth, perfectly accommodating and helpful. I honestly have nothing negative to say about this place, one of…"
August 2015,Perfect in every way,"I can't be positive enough about my experience at 41. I chose it as the location for me to propose to my girlfriend and everything was perfect.  Within days of booking and leaving a note stating my intentions, I was personally contacted by a lovely guy called Remus, who proceeded to help me plan every details of the day. He was fantastic and really set my mind at ease and assured me all would be well.  When we actually arrived on the day, every single member of staff was lovely and seemed genuinely like they wanted to help. Nothing was too much to ask. They really know how to provide great service. I won't spoil any surprises, but some of the services that come complimentary with your stay are just top notch as well.  The room was pristine and luxurious with an enormous bed and…"
July 2015,Treated like royalty!,"Hotel 41 was probably the loveliest hotel we have stayed in.  The staff were exceptional in so many ways. Knowing us by name right away, helping us with bookings and information about things to see and do, gracious service at the breakfasts and afternoon tea.  The room was so well appointed and spacious. A delicious birthday dessert in our room, a turn down at night with red roses and rose petals, plunder the pantry for late night snacking in the beautiful Executive Lounge.  We could go on and on.  The location across from Buckingham Palace is perfect!  I would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat!"
May 2015,Royal Visit,"41 Hotel is beyond description!  It has to be the next best thing to staying at Buckingham Palace.  The service is truly exceptional--I don't think there is one thing the staff wouldn't have done to cater to our every need.  Excellent staff, excellent food, the closest hotel to Buckingham Palace, immaculately clean--newspapers from all over the world to choose from, etc.  Henry Malcolm and his staff are top rate."
May 2015,Amazing Place,"We stayed here for one night back in May, but wished we had booked longer. From the moment we walked through the door we were made to feel so at home. The staff are so friendly and attentive. The rooms were just so delightful. The hotel arranged theatre tickets for us and when we returned our room had been lit by candlelight and rose petals scattered around the room.  The small lounge area is so lovely and the complimentary snacks are gorgeous.   The location is great, just round the corner from Buckingham Palace.  We have now booked a stay in another of the Red Carnation hotels in Dorset because of the fantastic experience at hotel 41.   We can't wait to come back."
August 2015,Nice,"Had friends coming from abroad and booked them here. No complaints all happy and fine.....could not see any issues or problems. Breaks aft did not try and other facilities most of the time in city and entertaing guests. However, no issues in hotel. "
July 2015,A wonderful and original hotel experience,"I had an exceptional 4 night stay in Hotel 41.  I felt like I was transported back to another time.  As wonderful and exciting as London is, I looked forward to returning to my hotel, every night. What sets this hotel apart is the amazing service.  From my initial arrival, I was welcomed with class and a sincere and genuine care.  Several of the staff are simply amazing.   The rooms are nice and well appointed (not gigantic) and it almost feels like you are on an upscale train or cruise. The gracious lobby for relaxing, having a drink or a bite to eat, is in a class by itself.   A very special experience and I hope to be back! Thanks to the entire staff for a wonderful experience."
July 2015,Fabulous,"Just had a lovely weekend at this hotel. From check in all the way to check out we were looked after amazingly with all staff making us feel very welcome. Room was very clean and comfortable. Great value, Will definitely be back!"
July 2015,Nice hotel,"Hello, I really love this hotel!!! Nice place, tasty food, the staff is friendly and quick!!! my lovely hotel in UK! I was there in this month for fourteen days and every day was amazing!!!! Highly recommended place!"
May 2015,Small yet Mighty!,"My husband travels to England every so often for business.  Although we appreciate the larger business hotels, we wanted to try something a little more intimate and elegant.  Our research lead us to the Hotel 41.  It is a lovely place to stay and it's loveliness begins the minute you walk into the hotel and never stops until the minute you check out.  That type of consistency is hard to find in the larger hotels.    Some details......the main common room of the hotel is absolutely elegant.  It looks like an old English library with very tall ceilings, tastefully wood paneled walls and lots of natural light.  This is where the concierge is as well as the small pantry area where there are complimentary snacks available all day long.  There are large grand chairs and small tables…"
July 2015,A wonderful hotel experience,"We recently spent 3 nights at Hotel 41, before a long haul flight home. It was a unique hotel experience, with beautiful black and white decor in our spacious room. The bed was extremely comfortable, with top quality linen.  The lounge was quiet, relaxing and a great place to end our busy days of sightseeing.  The service was really what set this hotel apart from others. Staff were extremely well trained, attentive and above all friendly. They appeared to really love their work, and nothing was too much trouble. We enjoyed the lovely breakfast and evening nibbles and the ""Plunder the pantry"" buffet available after 8.00pm. It was an expensive treat for us to stay here but we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and hope we can return one day."
July 2015,PERFECT ,This hotel is amazing!  The staff and incredible and really dote on the guests. This hotel is right across the street from the Royal Mews and a short walk to watch the Changing of the guards and the underground train. Great location.
July 2015,Exceptional,"This hotel breaks all the rules when it comes to exemplary service. They treat you like royalty from the time you book to the time you walk out the door. The rooms are well appointed but not huge by world standards. There is only 30 rooms in the boutique hotel and the staff help you believe you are the only guest that matters. The location is fantastic for walking to Buckingham Palace and just about anywhere else you want to go. I can not recommend them highly enough, but remember that this level of service and exclusivity does come at a price - however it is one I am willing to pay again. Just make sure you know the address when telling the cab drivers as it is a well kept secret and noone knew about it when we were travelling around (tell them it is next door to the Ruebens)"
June 2015,Hotel 41 showed us impeccable service with such grace and kindness,"First may I say Thank you!! Hotel 41 showed us impeccable service with such grace and kindness. Truly this is a hotel that stands out above all others.  One important factor is the absolutely wonderful people that work there. All of them exhibited utmost professionalism and kindness. I would like to thank Stephan  for making our stay truly magical. His exemplarity service, knowledge and charm entertained us. Stephan’s recommendation of the B-bar was perfect for a magnificent dinner, and what a wonderful accompaniment to your property. Their staff and Manager exceeded our every need. Also, Dickson was another favorite that made our stay so enjoyable. I can’t say enough how everyone there was so attentive and pleasant. Thank you to the front desk, for as many times as we came and…"
July 2015,Would rate above five stars if possible!,"London itself is amazing, but if you want to top off a visit by staying in an exceptional hotel, you should choose Hotel 41.  It's over-the-top . . . in service, food & drink offering, rooms, ambience, location -- we've stayed in luxury hotels in the Asia-Pacific having lived there for years and we'd be hard-pressed to find a hotel that surpasses Hotel 41.  We had one room for our teenage daughter and grand daughter, and the conservatory suite for ourselves -- our girls (and we!) loved the attention in the hotel's exec lounge where we had breakfast daily and ""plundered the pantry"" after our evenings out for shows and dinner.  The hotel recommended itineraries, shows, attractions, restaurants and set up everything for us.  This boutique hotel is not large, so personal, and we…"
July 2015,The best hotel anywhere,"I've lost count of how many times I have stayed here. I am simply spoiled and have to adjust my expectations way down for any other hotel, even some very nice and expensive ones. You will not find a staff anywhere that is more willing and able to help you. They remind me of my mom in the frequency of food and drink offerings. When they heard my boss's luggage was lost and they took over calling the airline to get it back. It's small but the decor is gorgeous, teeters on a very clever and luxe midpoint between the 19th century and modernity. It has its quirks, some of the rooms aren't really up to the size of the furniture, but nothing could take away from the service and the overall experience. On  a practical note, the food is also very good and they have free canapes and…"
May 2015,They know how to do things...,"41 is the type of hotel you don't really want to review as other people will go there and you want to keep it for yourself, but it is too good for that!  From the moment you walk in the door you are treated like royalty (like the Queen who lives across the road!)   All the staff were lovely and it felt like there was no limit to how much they would do for you.   Delicious hand made chocolates on entry and a lovely little note that made me appreciate the tiny details this hotel put into every room.  Don't forget the Plunder in the Pantry from 8.30pm... some delicious snacks are available for all hotel guests. I would have been disappointed to miss it.   The breakfast included in the room was HUGE - we actually couldn't eat it all.   The room was spotless, the hotel must have an…"
July 2015,You'll only believe it if you try it for yourself.,"All the positive reviews for 41 still don't really portray the fantastic service you will receive. From the moment we arrived they couldn't do enough for us. We were attending a function at another hotel on Park Lane, my wife had a problem with one of her shoes very shortly before we were due to leave. She saw Stefan who dealt with the problem in a matter of minutes.   The Executive Lounge is a lovely place to sit and it's very hard not to be tempted by the many complimentary treats that await the weal willed (such as myself).   The bed and pillows were amongst the most comfortable I think I've ever slept in.   I don't think I know enough superlatives to do 41 justice. All I can say is go and try it for yourself. I don't think you'd be disappointed."
July 2015,Absolutely Amazing,"Stayed here with friends for a visit to Wimbledon for three nights. The entrance is like going into a gentlemans club and your bags are seen to straight away. You check in on the fifth floor as these are the only two floors in the hotel and you are greeted with a glass of champagne. The rooms are amazing and nothing is missing from slippers at your bedside, robes in the bathroom to a full laundry service. The executive lounge is a large wood panelled room where you can just relax. There is a complimentary buffet and the food and choice is excellent. The staff have to have a special mention and nothing is too much trouble even to the fact the couple we went with wanted to see a theatre show and only mentioned it to the  consierge and half an hour later he was informed the one of…"
July 2015,Extreme Attention to Every Detail!,"Hotel 41 is as nice of a hotel as I've stayed in, but is still quite affordable. It's a young hotel, so the finishings are fresh. I expect the rates to climb quickly as this hotel gets discovered.  They did not overcharge for anything, and in fact through in a few freebies along the way (rose + candle turndown, a couple free breakfasts)."
July 2015,Luxury at its finest!,"I usually stay at the Four Season or the Ritz Carlton, this hotel is over and above like no other......The staff treats you like you are royalty to start off with but it does not does stop there, the rooms supercede any rooms I  have ever stayed in......Pure elegance!!  The rooms are so incredibly beautiful, the decor is a combination of old English cozy, mixed with art deco! I usually do not write reviews but I was so impressed by this hotel in every aspect, I cannot truly say enough.....I fell in love and I want to go back just to stay here again!!! I The staff, each and every one I encountered were so very impressive, the way they cater to you!!!!"
March 2015,wonderfuuuuul!!!,travelling to london was an experience of a lifetime! wonderfull place!! hotel 41 is the perfect hotel in order to have the best accomondation! we stayed there  week and we had one fore free!! it was the best choice i ever had!!!
April 2015,Very disappointed,This hotel did not live up to our expectations at all. We stayed here for three nights based on it being number 1 on TripAdvisor but I'm sorry fellow travellers and reviewers I just don't understand how the hotel gets the rating.  We stayed in a junior suite with an unnecessary television room downstairs. The bathroom was tiny and the room felt cramped and uncomfortable. I emailed staff prior to our stay on a weekend but because they were only working during the week didn't get a response for two days. Whilst there we asked staff to book a restaurant for us for lunch the next day at 12.30pm  only to turn up and find out the booking had not been made. When we returned to the room a couple of hours later we were called by staff to let us know they couldn't get us in at 12.30 but…
January 2015,Highly Recommended,"Amazing place, good food, nice staff and beautiful location. Unfortunately we stayed here only a night and all we wanted was to stay here more. They recommended a sightseeing tour to us which was a good idea. The laundry is fast and efficient. The service always came with a smile. The beds are very comfortable and pillows are very soft. We were a group of four stay here in two interconnected rooms. We did not eat here but I am sure that they serve excellent food as their menu looks very promising.  It is good value of money at the same time a nice retreat for a much needed break."
May 2015,Best Hotel Service Ever,"Our recent visit to Hotel 41 in London was nothing short of amazing. From the moment we arrived we immediately felt at home due to the absolutely incredible hotel staff that went out of the way to make sure our stay was a splendid one. From the front desk staff to the lounge and dining (Stefan had some wonderful stories and we miss him already) everything was world class. The rooms were spacious and quiet and had all the amenities one could possibly need. Next time you visit London please do yourself a favor and have the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41, you will be happy you did!"
May 2015,5 Star Luxsury with the feel of a B&B,I could not add much to all of the wonderful reviews of this Hotel. It is finds like this property that make Trip Advisor so great. They truly are a trusted source. We are a well traveled couple and this might have been one of the most comfortable experiences for us ever. I have never felt more welcomed or comfortable at a hotel. There was not anything we asked for that was not provide with an incredible sense of pleasure to be of service. The staff to guest ratio is incredible. The rooms are not large but very comfortable and well appointed. We had reserved a suite but we're also upgraded to a slightly larger suit with 2 full bathrooms. That was a real plus. If you want the big hotel experience this is not the place for you. If you want the very best personal service that you…
May 2015,THE best hotel in London,"My third visit to 41 and the most special yet.  Having saved up over the last few months, we booked the Conservatory Suite, A Night under the Stars.  We arrived early at around 12 noon and were welcomed in her usual wonderful way by Lauren in the Executive Lounge.  A glass of rose champagne started of our luxurious visit and we decided to stay in the lounge to have a light lunch before leaving for the theatre.  As our suite was not ready for us (which we knew that it wouldn't be) we were offered a courtesy room to get refreshed.  We returned after seeing ""Gypsy"" at the Savoy Theatre (thoroughly recommend it) and, after arranging with Remus what time we would like to go up on the roof, were shown to our suite.  The ground level had been converted into a small dining area for our…"
April 2015,Amazing !,"Wanted to treat ourselves to a great hotel in London for a couple of days, and picked the 41. Did not regret it for one second ! Was given a royal treatment from the moment we stepped inside this beautiful property. At the check-in counter we were offered a glass of champagne, we ended up emptying a bottle waiting for our room (we came with an early flight, so the 41 not to blame for the wait) All members of the staff very friendly and helping us with all our needs. Free afternoon snack very welcome after a long day walking in not too comfy boots ! Second night when we came back the room was turned into a romantic haven with rose pedals and candle-lights - adorable ! The heart of the hotel is a combined reception, bar and eating area that works very well. Our room was spacious…"
May 2015,Amazing place,"This hotel is just wow, on arrival I got the warmest welcome from reception and given the lowdown on the building and surrounding areas. My room was nice and spacious and extremely comfy. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, I am pretty sure if I had asked for a dancing elephant with bells on it they would have tried their hardest to accomodate it. Seriously tho my stay in London was made perfect to the whole team here and I will be back. Oh I must mention, the whiskey I was given (I had to wait a few mins for check in) was absolutely stunning, I wish I had asked what it was."
May 2015,Absolutely the best hotel. Hands down,"I join the THOUSANDS of happy reviewers who think this was an experience unlikely to be repeated elsewhere. And along with everyone else not that the staff made this great. How did they find these people? I have never felt so taken care of ! You feel like you are part of an exclusive secret club, there isn't even a sign for the hotel outside. My mother and I were in 4103 with a view over towards Buckingham Palace, but despite being on the main road the room was silent. Interesting bonus feature: they have instant hot water and amazing water pressure. This may sound like a weird thing to compliment, but after 10 days in Italy with wimpy showers this was heavenly. I learned from a previous reviewer to check with Costco Travel and this turned out to be GREAT advice! The bonus add…"
May 2015,Outstanding!! ,Another amazing visit to the 41!  There just isn't a finer spot to stay if you value outstanding customer service. The room was absolutely stunning and the use of the private club lounge is unparalleled. The 41 team even arranged a private rooftop champagne viewing of the VE Day flyover.    There is a reason this place is ranked the top.  They work very hard for it and it shows.  
June 2015,"Amazing, Friendly, Perfection","What a fabulous hotel, a stones throw away from the theatre we had booked & on the doorstep of Buckingham palace.. Thought the queen may invite us to tea, but no, sadly 😀 The hotel is small but the standard is unbelievably exceptional, the staff so friendly and interested in you & what you have to say, making it such a personal experience.. Extra little touches & treats at every turn. Full marks. Cannot fault it in any way whatsoever & whole hearted recommend "
June 2015,"I visited friends in outer London and wanted a few days in central London to re-visit old haunts, museums and theatres.","This small luxury hotel is situated within walking distance of many of the London sights and museums. The hop-on-hop-off bus stops outside the door. Restaurants and bars on streets parallel to Buckingham Palace Road are many and some very good. My room was perfect - and although I always insist on a room with a view and here there was no view, I didn't mind. It's London centre after all. The staff was very friendly, helpful and efficient. Breakfast delicious. The South African touch was pleasant. The lounge buffet in the evenings reminded me of safaris in Africa, with sundowners  and after-dinner chats with fellow guests. I felt at home, and welcome, even though I was alone.  The hotel also booked theatre tickets for me. I had selected a few plays (from internet)  and they…"
June 2015,Outstanding Experience,"My husband and I traveled to Europe for our very first time and as a part of our stay we booked several nights at Hotel 41. Based on previous reviews I had extremely high expectations and not only were they met, they were exceeded. This is not your ordinary hotel, this is an experience. The moment you walk in you know this is going to be something special. From the detailed amenities in the room, to the lovely breakfasts and afternoon cocktail hours you never want to leave. Do not look elsewhere, if you can book a reservation, do it now, you will not be disappointed."
June 2015,Wonderful,My daughter and son in law booked an overnight stay in Hotel 41 as a 60 th birthday present to begin our trip on the Orient Express. What an amazing start to a trip of a lifetime.  Luxury and excellent service Staff were wonderful. Food excellent ( loved the gin and tonic ice cream) Nothing was too much trouble.  Will definitely book to stay here again
June 2015,Good service,Hotel 41 has very good service. Service in London can be very hit and miss in London and the rest or England. So it was very nice to have some personal service. The rooms are cosy but space in London is a premium. I noticed they took the time out to talk to guests especially the solo travellers and seemed quite genuine. 
June 2015,AMAZING! WONDERFUL! EXCELLENCE!,This is the best place to stay in London. We were on a trip in honor of our 40th wedding anniversary.  We feel so fortunate we stayed at Hotel 41. The hotel went out of its way to make it a special week. We enjoyed a cake one night and a romantic candle lit room on another night! They provide a fresh fruit plate each day which really was nice. The executive lounge had snack during the day. My husband loved the ice cream that was available. We are just a middle class working couple but staying at this hotel is well worth the cost. We saved a long time for this trip and starting it off in London at Hotel 41 just reinforced our belief that this will be the vacation of a lifetime!  Thank you to all the wonderful staff. A special thanks to Mr. Otto who made my husband feel at ease…
April 2015,Truly Amazing,"We’ve recently returned from a 4 night break celebrating our 20th Wedding Anniversary and from the minute you arrive to the moment you (sadly have to) leave, you are treated like a VIP guest.  Attentive staff, attention to detail and immaculate rooms & lounge area make this a truly amazing experience.   The best hotel we’ve ever stayed in and now our number one choice for a London break – Hotel 41 has raised the bar!"
June 2015,A perfect Boutique Hotel,"A wonderful stay...a very personal, small hotel.  A very nice accommodation, supported by a personable, professional, and helpful staff.  I know we are missing some names, but Magda, Lauren, Stephanie, and Stefan were a joy. The ""library"" area is most charming and relaxing.  We felt like a little of home.  It was a special treat since returning to our old London neighborhood from 10 years prior.  The ""bbar"" restaurant is excellent, and We would recommend Ffiona's French Bistro on Kensington Church Street to anyone who likes a small, intimate, and great food restaurant."
May 2015,Very nice hotel,"Very good hotel! we went there with my husband for our wedding anniversary and we had a great time. The hotel is great, people are very nice, and the breakfast is the best!! the only bummer was that they made us a reservation for an afternoon tea at another hotel, and when we arrived there, they had a long wait, so we had to leave, though this wasn't 41 hotel fault, they made that reservation for us... but all the other thing were great!"
December 2014,Service beyond any expectation,"I’m really torn on providing my feedback on this hotel.  My family and I just spent 4 nights at the ""41"".  I consider it more of a private club than just a hotel.  If everyone were to experience the level of service and genuine hospitality that my family did, then it would surely be everyone’s top choice to stay while in London, and my ability to get future reservations will be severely diminished.    If you want to stay at a large hotel where no one calls you by name, doesn't remember your favorite drink, and charges you for club access, then this is not the hotel for you.  If exceptional personalized service is what you are looking for, then there is no better hotel in London.  When in London this is where I will stay."
June 2015,MOST AMAZING HOTEL EVER!!!,"I cannot say enough about this hotel!! It is very small (I think only about 25 rooms?) because they want to be able to cater to your EVERY need. The staff is able to accommodate your needs better when the ratio is about one staff member per room. Not only is it very quaint and unassuming on the outside (as famous as this place is, none of the taxi drivers knew where it was?? I had to name the hotel NEXT DOOR, and then they knew where to take me) but it is beautiful on the inside!! Dark wood, rich fabrics, fireplaces. The common area is where you go every night to ""plunder the pantry"" (which translates to FREE FOOD!) cocktails and gourmet snacks. And the service could not be better!! Whatever you need, they will get it (even if they have to walk 6 blocks to get it elsewhere and…"
October 2014,Simply the best,"Love this hotel. The staff, the rooms, the honesty bar, the champagne on arrival, the breakfast, the all day snacks to take out and the evening hot snacks, absolute attention to detail.  Brilliantly located next to all the sites. Personal touches were excellent as we had a special occasion on one of the weekends we stayed.   Can't wait to go again soon  "
August 2015,Outstanding Dirty Gin Martinis at the 41.,"The 41 is a lovely discrete boutique hotel. The staff are very friendly and attentive and they mix the best DGM (Dirty Gin Martini). The hotel has a genteel ambiance and it was great to be able to come back after a show and 'raid the pantry'. A wonderful 3 days and thank you for the bottle of bubbles on my birthday, very thoughtful."
June 2015,Back again ,What can i say about this hotel this got to be only of the best hotel in London and their getting better and better the rooms are very nice and very clean the beds are very nice and comfortable as well this is my second visit in a few month and it won't be the last 
August 2015,Simply delightful,"Our stay at Hotel 41 was delightful even before we checked in for a four day weekend to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. A few days prior to our arrival I received a preference questionnaire: Were we celebrating a special occasion? Did we want feather or foam pillows? Would I like some flowers delivered to the room? Would we like a car arranged to pick us up at the airport? This was indicative of the hotel's attention to detail.  The staff at Hotel 41 are serious about service.  If you have a preference, they will oblige you and remember your choice.  Rather than having a separate number for room service, housekeeping, etc., there is simply the ""Whatever, whenever"" button on your telephone. Why would you want or need anything else?  At breakfast our second morning,…"
June 2015,Comfort and Style !!!!!,"This is definitely the best Hotel in London! My grandson and I returned this past June for our yearly European Trip. We absolutely love it! This is our third year staying at the 41 Hotel. Upon our arrival we were greeted by the same wonderful staff who are so friendly and accommodating to us every year. The Hotel is very beautiful with it's black and white décor which is classy and elegant. I have traveled around the world and I've stayed in a lot of nice Hotel but this one by far is the finest and it is truly because of the staff at this hotel they truly pride themselves in excellent customer service and kindness.  Jeffrey Shaner Las Vegas, Nevada"
August 2015,Small and perfectly formed!,"I've had the pleasure of staying on 41 on a number of occasions now,  we had a wonderful weekend this month to celebrate our 21st wedding anniversary.  It's still a joy to walk into the hushed lobby and be escorted upstairs and offered a choice of fine champagne while you relax and check in. As a repeat visitor it was great that a number of staff remembered me from the last visit and it's like catching up with an old friend. The bottle of champagne provided by the hotel on hearing of our anniversary was a lovely gesture and really appreciated  - Louis Roderer, my favourite as it happens.  Everyone here is so helpful and it's always nice to see the GM at breakfast maintaining a quiet but approachable presence which is not the case at many 5 star establishments.  The balance…"
August 2015,Nice Stay,Having read all the reviews on trip adviser i was really expecting something very special to other five star properties that i have stayed at over the years but this didn't happen The Property is well maintained and the staff as a whole are great a special mention to Dixion who was fantastic however i thought the front desk as they did not have a separate conceirge was not as knowledgable as others i have stayed at. The bedroom was well appointed with a nice sized bathroom and plenty of hanging space and well maintained  The Breakfast was very good and the Burger for lunch is probably one of the best i have ever had 41 is small and intermit and we enjoyed our stay
August 2015,Service Perfection,"We spent a long weekend visiting London and made Hotel 41 our base. We stayied in the Conservatory suite. From the moment of arrival the service was exceptional. All the staff are very friendly, remember your names, take an interest in what you are doing and nothing is too much trouble. Excellent breakfasts, great afternoon tea and the most comfortable bed I have slept on, in any hotel, anywhere, ever. Highly recommended."
July 2015,Oh Dear--Too Good!!,"First time and had some expectations, but-WOW!--this establishment is both sophisticated, elegant, and yet, fun. Staff is excellent, the food first-class, the suite was exemplary in every detail (where are the nicks and scratches on the furniture, why isn't the carpeting stained, why is everything just right!?). I cannot say enough about my stay and it contributed so much to enjoying my London vacation.  Thank you, 41--I'll be back,"
August 2015,One of the best,"Quite simply, one of the best hotels we've ever stayed in. Small and friendly, the staff are exceptional! Worth every cent - and the executive lounge is a great place to sit and have a drink after a day out in the city. The staff's advice about what to see and do was invaluable as well. Can't recommend it highly enough!"
August 2015,Best Service ever,In 35 years of luxury travel we have never had the total quality of service Hotel41 offers. Every member of staff seemed to be hand picked to be the best and provided us with stunning English service and incredible personal and friendly attention like being an honoured family friend. Lauren your team is the world's best!
August 2015,Very special hotel.,"My wife and I have just returned from a one night stay at Hotel 41.   Our short stay was an amazing treat and was better than we imagined, even after reading the reviews here. This was principally down the very high standard of service and the attentive friendly staff. I could write about the many little touches that made our stay special, but like many of the reviewers, I will leave it for you to have your own experience.  We are already planning our next stay."
August 2015,Wonderfull...,"We booked this hotel after reading several good reviews, but for us is was even better then we had expected. From the moment we entered we were treated as royals.  The room, and bathroom was great and very clean. Hotel is located near Buckingham Palace, and you can do everything by feet. But what us pleased the best was the kindness off the staff. Nothing is too much... Special thanks to Flo(rant), Dickson and Mitchell... Thanks for all you did... We will come back very soon..."
August 2015,fabulous experience,"I loved this hotel! Every time I turned around, I was being offered a glass of champagne. Luxurious linens, great food, beautiful decor, and all in the best area of London (across the street from Buckingham Palace!)  Best customer service - I thought they had mistaken me for a celebrity! Small and intimate. Everyone knows your name. I'm going back!  Keep in mind this is Europe and the rooms are not your standard cookie cutter layouts. We had an executive king which was a bed area and adjoining siting area. The bathroom had both a tub and shower, but the layout was one long room due to the existing architecture. It seemed odd at first, but we got used to it pretty fast."
June 2015,Simply the best,"We came to Hotel 41 for a bit of luxury for my wife's birthday earlier this year, and we were not disappointed. After we'd navigated our way in (via the hotel next door by mistake, who amusingly said they'd ""upgraded us to their 5-star hotel""!), the experience was exactly as promised - and more.  Service, champagne at check-in, the pantry to plunder - all perfect. The room was outstanding and very comfortable (and a free upgrade, a very nice extra birthday present!); best of all, having opted in advance to buy some birthday chocolates, the message I'd put down turned out to be delivered in cake form! A wonderful surprise.  Having eaten out during the day, the excellent food at the pantry was just right for a light supper. Breakfast was superb as well.  All in all, a perfect stay…"
August 2015,Amazing,"I booked the conservatory suite to celebrate our first wedding anniversary as surprise for my husband.  He was blown away.  From the moment we stepped through the doors to leaving, the whole experience was awesome.  All the staff provided us with exemplary service.  Whilst checking in, we were given a choice of champagne to choose from.  They serve a most wonderful brut rose champagne which we thought was smoother than some Cristal we have had.  We were shown to our room which was amazing with a small lounge area and steps leading upstairs to the bedroom with the glass ceiling.  The hotel had kindly provided an anniversary cake and some delicious petit fours.  We enjoyed afternoon tea in the cosy lounge area and again with the delicious champagne.  We went out for dinner and…"
August 2015,First class,"Hi! When we arrived at Hotel 41 we were pleasantly greeted by the lady on the front desk. We were then shown up stairs to the Executive Lounge, which when you walk inside is simply stunning. The hotel staff had everything already organised for us including complimentary champagne yum yum! We were shown to our room (which had been upgraded) and wow! It was breathtaking. The attention to detail was second to none. And the added surprise was the jacuzzi in the bathroom!!! After a few drinks in the city we retired back to the Executive Lounge where we nibbled on a delicious selection of foods and more champagne. The staff attended to our every need and couldn't have made us happier. Our whole experience was brilliant from the moment we stepped foot inside to the moment we left. If…"
August 2015,Perfect again,"Every staff member we encountered at 41 was friendly, helpful, and professional. The service was impeccable! Each morning we would call the front desk for our daily Latte, which would arrive within 3 minutes. One of our favorite activities was sitting in the Lounge for afternoon tea or a perfect drink.  We will return to London again simply for the pleasure of staying at 41."
August 2015,Beyond expectation,"I had read the reviews. I had looked at the website. I had no idea just how good the experience would actually be once I visited. My wife and I had a long weekend in London at the start of our holiday and made Hotel 41 our base.   The Executive lounge is a brilliant concept and works so well as the 'hub' of this hotel. On arrival, as many have noted, we were offered champagne and we sat and relaxed for so long that we felt completely 'at home' in the lounge. In face it was over 2 hours after check in that we actually managed to find the room we had booked!  At breakfast Stefan made us feel very welcome and within a short space of time he felt like a member of the family rather than a member of staff. This is the secret to this hotel: detail. In our package we had a 'romantic…"
June 2015,High quality throughout,"Had a great visit last week, my first stay. Everything is just done to excellence. The rooms are absolute luxury as you would expect from a hotel of this rating. I will definitely be returning soon. The only thing I would do differently is stay longer."
June 2015,Simply the best hotel I have ever stayed in bar none!,"Without seeming to boast, I have stayed in some of the best hotels in over 45 countries and been blown away by a few, but nothing compares to 41. If like me you read the 'Terribles' first (Mostly for fun) you will understand that '41' is located on the 5th floor of the 'Rubens' hotel and has a separate entrance. No problem for us; in fact the uniqueness was intriguing and original which is always a good start. When you get to the lounge/reception, you enter a small club like environment and are welcomed by a choice of 4 champagnes whilst formalities are swiftly dealt with. You feel immediately welcome and individual.  You are looked after by genuine, engaging people (I cannot bring myself to call them staff) who really care that you enjoy your stay. If you are looking for the…"
May 2015,Magic Stay in London,"Just spent a magical 4 days in London at Hotel 41. From the very moment we crossed the threshold of the property, special moment after special moments were created. Mr. Hendry and his team were welcoming and so accommodating with every request. We celebrated my birthday and our Anniversary on this trip which was noted by the team in so may ways. Room upgrade, sweet birthday treats in the room, romantic rose petal turn down. WOW, WOW. Do not hesitate to book your stay here. After staying in many luxury hotels, I can honestly say that this was by far the best hotel stay ever. Looking forward to staying here and other Red Carnation properties. "
May 2015,My stay,Fantastic staff service hotel food quality everything we could of wished for and a surprise to us an upgrade just a delight I want to go back.the staff where exceptionally professional.  Kind attentive a joy to stay in this hotel
May 2015,Just perfect,"We stayed for only one night and I didn't want to leave!  It was a special occasion, 10 years since our first date and my husbands birthday and it was absolutely worth every single penny.  The team who work at Hotel 41 are lovely, attentive and unobtrusive.  The hotel is gorgeous with the executive lounge being at the heart of the hotel.  The snack bar/raid the pantry is a lovely touch and very nice to nibble on whilst you have a glass of wine/champagne sitting (or curled up like I was!) comfortably on one of the sofas.   The room was perfect, sumptuous and relaxing and the turndown service was just lovely - lots of little touches that make it memorable.  I didn't want to leave and a huge 'thank you' to the team for making our stay so special.  We will be back!"
May 2015,Anniversary Trip,"The hotel had such a welcoming atmosphere! Sure it is a smaller hotel but we felt that added to it's charm and uniqueness. We have only nice things to say about this hotel. It was our favorite by far during our 3 week trip. (We also visited Paris, Venice, and Rome). There is no other hotel that comes close to the personalized service you will get at Hotel 41. We will definitely stay here in the future and highly recommend it!"
May 2015,Pure indulgence,"Well what can I say except this hotel is amazing. We chose this hotel to spend our honeymoon and we were both completely blown away.  On arrival we were met and taken to the Executive Lounge to check in, during this time we were asked which champagne we would like to have whilst checking in. The atmosphere was relaxed and we had another glass and some snacks before being taken to our room.  Our room was sensational, everything was of an extremely high standard, could not fault a thing!! Truly perfect!!  We had asked for afternoon tea at 3pm,  we were both looking forward to it and again it exceeded our expectations, in fact we couldn't  finish all the cakes, so they kindly put them in a box for later!  The staff are all exceptional; they are both professional and friendly, we…"
May 2015,Spoil yourself ,We stayed 3 nights in April. Everything that has been said in previous reviews is true. The hotel is 5 star but difference is the number of rooms. With only 60 people staying in house at any one time the staff have the time to stop and talk and to help in any small way they can. Nothing is too much trouble and make sure that you have high tea one afternoon. It is fantastic. 
May 2015,i can't imagine a better hotel !,"This is simply the best hotel you Can imagine. Everybody is so friendly and unbelievable friendly. Noting you ask is to much. The decoration and look of the hotel is beautiful. Our room was very big for London standards. The executive lounge is so comfortable , with al the free snacks and delicious cocktails. Lamine makes the best Mai Tais ever ! I had about 8 of them en Lamine was my new best friend ;-) This was our sixth hotel in London but from now on we will keep coming back here because you get the feelings that al the staff are your friends en we miss them already :-)."
May 2015,An incredibly impressive hotel,"We first stayed in 41 a few years ago and experienced a level of service far beyond anything we had previously encountered, we had a wonderful stay and enjoyed every moment.  Naturally for our next London stay we chose 41 but I can remember being worried that our first visit was a 'one off' and that we could possibly be disappointed, amazingly it just seemed to be even better which I thought would be impossible.......we have recently returned from our fifth stay and this hotel never fails to impress, this latest stay was just amazing. As always upon arrival we were warmly greeted, Monika ( who is lovely and extremely good at her job) booked us in making sure we had everything we needed . Then as always the service was excellent from everyone, I'm sorry not to be able to remember…"
June 2015,Best Hotel Ever,"I have never posted a review on Trip Advisor, but am compelled to let everyone know how wonderful Hotel 41 was.  My wife and I stayed there for three days on a stopover to Italy.  We have stayed in many 5 star hotels but chose Hotel 41 because it was number 1 on Trip Advisor.  It was the best hotel we have ever stayed in!!! It did not have the best views.  It did not have the biggest or nicest rooms, It did not have the best food.  But everything as a whole was just perfect.  The room, the location, the food were all excellent and the staff was unbelievable.  I couldn't recommend it more."
July 2015,"Yes, it's all true!","We booked this hotel based on the reviews and they really are all true.  We've stayed at top hotels, like the Ritz Carleton, and 41 is absolutely the best.  The key here is the customer service.  For example, we indicated on our check in form that we were each celebrating a birthday and they arranged for a birthday cake in our room when we checked in.  They helped us move the rental car, retrieved the car upon check out and packed our bags in car -  we just walked out and left.  Since the hotel is small and intimate, the staff members all know your name and there are multiple staff to help you in every way possible.     Really, I can't say enough about this hotel.  We want to return to London just to stay there again!"
July 2015,International staff at the top of the game,All reviews are true.  This property is a gem managed by caring staff that is only visible when needed.  It is a bit like magic. The staff provide not only fabulous service but are able to do so in many languages. We were truly impressed by this perfect blend of the best of English traditions (think: private club) with a tech-entertainment-restaurant-outing-savvy staff that will make you feel at home whether your first language is English or French or Hungarian or German . . .and the list goes on.  We will definitely return.
June 2015,Great hotel -- Best staff ever,"Given how many reviewers give the Hotel 41 five stars, there's not much I can add other than my complete agreement.  It is simply a superb hotel -- location, rooms, amenities, dining are just wonderful.  And even better are the staff -- friendly, genuine, helpful.  Concierge, reception, dining area are all staffed by wonderful people.  The hotel is small.  Check in, lobby and dining are all combined in one area centrally located among the rooms.  However, there is never a crowded feel.  Instead, the hotel is cozy, just a wonderful place to relax between jaunts among London's many places to visit.  Food service seems to run just about all day -- excellent breakfast, scones, snacks and tea in the afternoon and a wonderful canape spread in the early evening. Next time I visit…"
May 2015,Best Service Ever!!,"All of the reviews are true. Great location, great rooms and the best service I have ever had. You will not be disappointed!!!  You won't believe how wonderful it is. Free champagne at registration,  a butler to help you, plunder the pantry etc."
June 2015,"Like Mary Poppins - ""Practically perfect in every way""","Simply put, the best hotel I've ever had the pleasure of visiting. Every aspect of our stay was managed with care and attention, from check-in to check-out.   The hotel is gorgeous on the interior - I've seen plenty of hotel websites with pretty pictures, but 41 actually exceeds expectations in person.   As we were there for a special occasion, the 41 staff upgraded us to a split-level suite for the first few nights of our stay. While the smaller room was perfectly nice and would have been great for the stay, the suite was out of this world. A huge luxurious room with a bathroom larger (and nicer) than some hotel rooms where I've stayed.   The staff was all friendly and personable - particularly Stef, who served us our check-in champagne and kept us laughing with his quotes and…"
June 2015,Perfect stay,"Hotel 41 is the perfect place to stay when exploring or doing business in London. The hotel is the most hidden gem on Buckingham Palace Road. A short walk to Victoria Station as well as many of the treasured London sights. The staff are extremely attentive and always warmly welcome you back after each day's outings or as you wake in the morning. They are extremely adept at getting reservations at that ""impossible to book restaurant"" and know of all the best activities and events available during your stay. They have become a home away from home while in London."
June 2015,A peaceful haven in a busy city,"Every aspect of our stay here was outstanding from the warm welcome we received on entering the building.  All the high praise given in the many reviews is well deserved.  We were staying in London for a long weekend primarily for a concert but had decided to take in the many sights that we never get round to seeing. This hotel is a perfect base. It is so well situated for walking, tubes and even the hop on hop off bus if you so choose.  The weekend was warm and it was such a welcome to return to the calmness of the hotel and to our beautiful air conditioned room.  Nothing is too much trouble at this hotel. The staff and the service are truly first class.  We stay in many hotels all around Europe and the USA and this hotel is now in our top three of all time favourites.  With…"
June 2015,my special birthday treat,"my wonderful husband booked this for my birthday on June 18th and it was out of this world. On check in you are led to a beautiful Hogwarts like library and ask which on of four champaignes you would like with canapes. The chap outside had already parked our car and our bags for the over night stay taken to our suite.  The suite was fantastic, with a tray of chocolate desserts waiting for us. We ate the the hotel restaurant and I was presented with a stunning chocolate cake with my name and happy birthday on the plate, so special and elegant.  We had port in the librayr and more canapes then back to our room where the most preciaou husband in the world, had arranged rose petals, classic fm on the radio and floating candels. it was heaven, it really was. The butler service ;…"
June 2015,Gem at 41 Buckingham Palace Road,Our party of four had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 for seven nights last week. We had two rooms and both were perfect in every way. This is a boutique hotel and the service is excellent. It is located in Belgravia just steps from Buckingham Palace. I highly recommend Hotel 41.
May 2015,A haven from the hustle and bustle of London.,I hope the staff at 41 realise how much their attention to their customers and the thoughtful detail to what is provided is appreciated. When one spends much of ones life looking after others needs it is so good to be look after in such a caring way for two days oneself. Thank you all at 41.
May 2015,Simply the best!!,"I stayed at this hotel for 1 night and loved it. Everything from the personal welcome on arrival, to the complimentary drinks and snacks, and the amazing 'executive lounge', was excellent. Hotel 41 is very well located across the street from Buckingham Palace and 1 block from the underground station, making it a great place to explore London. The hotel feels small and personal, and the staff are incredible friendly, attentive knowledgeable and courteous. Our room was wonderful with an extremely comfortable bed and a huge bath plus separate walk-in shower. All the staff went out of their way to make sure there was nothing lacking, incredibly attentive, knowledgeable and courteous. The breakfast was delivered into our room at agreed time; it was absolutely delicious (you must try…"
May 2015,Excellent service as usual.,"I have had the pleasure of staying at 41 on a number of occasions now and the level of hospitality is always excellent.  It's quite important to understand what this hotel is, and what it is not when looking to book.  This is not a large hotel with statement lobby and public areas, spa, gym and restaurants on site. There are plenty of other 5 stars options in London to meet these requirements.  This is a place to walk around in your slippers, a cross between  a private club and your own home with exceptional hospitality. Perfect for my own needs.  There is still some building work going on in the area which can be a little intrusive so it's best to check the very latest situation with the hotel. I did comment on the noise level and Moniker acted immediately to remove some…"
May 2015,#1 Hotel in London Exceeds Expectations,"I stayed here for 3 nights and I had a group of 9 people booked on this trip (we had 9 rooms). Customer service is their mantra! From the moment we walked in to the moment we checked out, every single detail, things you don't even think of, were taken care of. You can call room service for coffee and it was pretty much at your room before you even hung up the phone.  Room: the size of the room isn't large but much larger than you would expect being in prime location across the Royal Mews. Very clean, orderly and the most comfortable bed and pillows I've experienced in a while.  Food: quality of food and the service at the lounge was great. I really enjoyed their breakfast.   Executive Lounge: this is where you come to relax, eat, drink or have a quiet chat. This lounge was the…"
April 2015,"Small size, great service and comfort","This gem across from the Royal Mews offers first class service from all the staff, top to bottom.  No question or request is too small.  Our room, though not large, was luxurious and had every thoughtful amenity, and the bath with large tub and large shower was elegantly fitted out.  Highly recommended if you love a small, quiet hotel with top notch personal service."
January 2015,Superb again,"There is a reason why this is the best hotel in London, the staff. Every member of staff from the concierge to the maintenance man offers the unobtrusive excellence in customer service that other larger establishments can only dream of. Our second visit, this time for my birthday, last year was for my husbands birthday, I cannot recommend Hotel 41 highly enough and we are already planning next years visit"
May 2015,Simply the Best,"We have stayed at 41 for a number of years now on our frequent trips to London. This boutique luxury hotel is a gem.   Quite simply the best at personal service, atmosphere, and luxury.  Mr. Hendry's staff raises the bar on service to levels rarely experienced in any field these days.  The rooms are unique due to the nature of the building, and some reviews commenting upon size are unfair. The architecture, decor, and feel is that of London.  This is not a large property, and the small number of rooms allow for an intimate feeling of a personal club.  The staff focus on your personal wishes with discrete service that exceeds all expectations.  Every need is attended with professionalism and friendliness.  We can't wait to return!"
April 2015,"Excellent service,ambience & anticipation","I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. I cant speak highly enough of the staff & their anticipation of my needs. Being a single middle aged traveller I was looked after incredibly well. The staff seemed to anticipate what I needed & action it to make such a wonderful stay. From the beautiful breakfasts to the liesurely late afternoon drinks in the lounge, everything was perfect. The rooms are very comfortable & to return after a busy day, to sliced lemon, lime, olives & a bucket of ice & fresh water bottles was just brilliant.Just nothing was too much trouble, the best discreet, friendly service I have ever encountered at some of the finest hotels. Congratulations to the staff & management for making my stay such a wonderful experience."
April 2015,A relaxing oasis in busy London,"We recently stayed four nights at Hotel 41. When we travel we usually do not spend much time in our hotel, but the care and friendly attention we received at ""41"" enticed us to return each day.  The staff is outstanding (thank you Malcolm, Lauren, Monika and everyone whose name I cannot remember) and they all deserve the rave reviews they have received from other guests.  Every question, request or whim is treated seriously and responded to immediately.  After a long day of travel to London it was delightful to be offered a glass of chilled champagne while our bags were taken to our room.  Our executive king room was roomy (particularly for a European city hotel), comfortable, and extremely quiet.  The location between Buckingham Palace (across the street) and Victoria Station…"
April 2015,We very much liked this hotel,"We recently had the pleasure of spending three nights at Hotel 41.  The hotel is very well located across the street from Buckngham Palace.  The service could not have been better and the staff was friendy and very accomodating.  We give this ony 4 stars because of the size of the room, and the lack of a lobby at street level, but we would highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again when we return to London."
May 2015,"More than a luxurious hotel, it is the welcome home every traveler hopes to find.","We were greeted by friendly, warm people who offered refreshments (available all day) as we rested in the cushy leather furnishings of the lobby/lounge. There are substantial, old-world tables that look and feel as if they were created for the space where you can enjoy the excellent food and drink. Our room and bath were charming and beyond comfortable. However, the most outstanding feature of this hotel is the staff! Stefan, Stephanie, Lauren, and everyone else who helped us get tickets to plays, taxis, detailed directions, etc. we're fabulous. We will return to this amazing, unique establishment."
June 2015,"Classy, Old Style Hotel in the Heart of the City","A special place to stay when visiting London. Located almost across the street from the palace, this hotel offers old world charm, fantastic service and all day food and drink. All rooms are located on one floor so getting a room can require advanced booking. The rooms were well adorned and the service was above expectations."
June 2015,Like a Private Club,"We recently stopped over in London for 3 nights after a trip to Europe.  We totally enjoyed our stay at this outstanding hotel.  If you are expecting a grand lobby, multiple restaurants, hundreds of rooms and numerous amenities, you may be disappointed.  This is a small, say 30 room hotel, located within the Ruben's Hotel just across from the Buckingham Palace Mews.  It has the ambiance of a private club. The rooms and facilities are very nice and the location is perfect. What sets this hotel apart and made our stay very pleasant was quite simply the wonderful staff.  From our arrival to our departure the entire staff made our visit pleasant and enjoyable.  They provided excellent restaurant recommendations and tips on sightseeing. We would definitely return again."
June 2015,Impossible. ..,"It seems impossible to describe in words just how fabulous this hotel is.  From the moment you arrive,  you are treated as a special  guest.  Your favorite beverages are provided along with lovely appetizers.  The ""plunder the pantry"" option is the perfect way to end the evening.  Our room was spacious by London standards and furnished with every thing you might possibly need. The bathroom was quite spacious and light.   I left the hotel less than a week ago and already I miss Stefan,  Mitchell, and Dickson!  Thanks for making our stay so grand! "
June 2015,In a League Of Its Own!,"So after 8 years of using Tripadvisor to give me all the best tips and information for all my trips without ever giving back to the TA community through reviews of my own, a hotel has finally come along that has given my lazy self no choice but to post.    Hotel 41 is hands down the best hotel experience I have ever had.  Being a consultant, I have stayed at all the top branded 5 star properties and was truly blown away during my recent stay at Hotel 41 for my 1 yr anniversary. WOW!   Many have said it before me, but what sets Hotel 41 apart is their remarkable client service.  Every single hotel staff you encounter will be dedicated to providing the best service they are able to and make it look so effortless.  From the minute I stepped into the doors until the minute I left I…"
June 2015,An Outstanding Experience!,"Hotel 41 far exceeded my expectations!!  The staff was extremely helpful, the accommodations were beyond compare and the overall experience was more than worth the few extra dollars that it cost.  The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Parliament and many other sites.  I would stay there again."
March 2015,one of the best in London,this is so amazing. I really love it. the staffs are so professional. This is for the guests who love design and luxury style. facilities is so nice. I love everything about this hotel. I definitely come back here again soon.
May 2015,Wonderful Staff and Impeccable Service,"What a wonderful hotel. This is a real gem in London. It is the fifth floor of Ruben’s hotel (the converted ballroom), but it has its own private entrance and staff. We were a little concerned about the location (having previously stayed mainly in Kensington and Mayfair): it is close to Victoria Station, but also has another fine address close by in Buckingham Palace Road.  Although busy, the location was good, and it is only a few minutes’ walk to the underground. Our whole experience here was just perfect. From the time of arrival when you are met at the front door, whisked up the lift to the executive lounge where check-in is undertaken while drinking a lovely glass of champagne. Then escorted to your room where the luggage is already in place and a large bowl of fruit and…"
June 2015,Splendid! ! !,"The hotel is great!!!! I stayed for the second time and finally decided to give my review. Is one of those hotels that you don't mind what you'll pay at the end if the day. Because it deserves it all. Everything is so So SO amazing. The rooms,  the staff all the hotel areas and the location too. We were really glad that we had the chance to stay here again. We feel so lucky. That's what all the hotels should look and operate like. A stay will make you gain the same opinion. Thanks to the management and the staff for an unforgettable 2nd stay...!!!!"
June 2015,Marvelous one week stay,We spent the last week of May at Hotel 41 and was thrilled with our stay. The service was impeccable and we enjoyed the cosy boutique atmosphere of the establishment. All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly and we felt like home. We were able to get last minute tickets for plays and restaurant reservation. It goes to show that what makes a great hotel is the ground staff who runs the premise. It is a hotel that we will certainly look forward to stay when we next visit London. 
March 2015,"In a world of fine hotels, this one stands out as one of the very best.","To celebrate a special birthday, a small group of friends traveled to London leaving husbands and families behind in the US.  I travel worldwide regularly for work.   To say that this was the finest service I have ever experienced is an understatement.  It is almost impossible to describe.    More important than the actual service was the sincerity expressed by the entire staff.  From the daily pillow choices, to the thought and attention to every detail- large or tiny- nothing was left to chance.   I would imagine leaders of countries do not  experience this type of attention and comfort.   Hotel 41 is a gem.  I will be back.   Nancy.    April, 2015."
March 2015,"Superb, attentive staff make hotel 41 magic","From the champagne reception to numerous other personal touches which went above and beyond our expectations, the  staff really make hotel 41 a special place to stay. We went away for a romantic night away and it was perfect. Thoroughly recommend this place and worth  every penny"
April 2015,The best hotel experience I've ever had,"Once you stay at the 41, you will never want to stay anywhere else. Lovely rooms, impeccable service, all wants and needs cared for graciously.  The hotel took care of every dinner reservation, and provided a beautiful birthday experience for my daughter. A true gem. You will not be disappointed. "
March 2015,Above and Beyond,"I can't accurately describe the level of service that 41 provides for all its guests. From pots of tea on demand to your choice of pillows and almost any amenity imaginable in your room, you truly feel like there is nothing that they will not do to make you happy.  I loved being able to raid the pantry after a late night to get either small snacks like pasta or stew, or deserts and cocktails."
February 2015,"Marvellous value, all round brilliance!","I visited here with my niece and her husband last week and have to say that our experience was utterly faultless. We dined too. The staff make you feel like family from the offset and although they are clearly doing their jobs - by god they do it well. They really do go the extra mile. It's smiles all round and the rooms are just immaculate. We stayed for 2 nights in 2 rooms and I can honestly say we could've eaten our meals from the floor. I have frequented a few hotels in London at the upper end of the market, some of which are (or were about 4/5 years back) thriving on outdated and unjustified reputations. This one takes the prize. It's absolutely brilliant in every way. Food, service, room service (prompt and friendly) value and well, I just love it. Will without a doubt…"
March 2015,Its really nice.,"Probably the best hotel so far that I visited in London. Like in other boutique hotels the rooms are not too large, but this was big enough for a pleasant stay of one night. Everything is really top of the line. Especially the lounge is nice. Just great. Will come back. Maybe this tells everyone what kind of standard to expect: In the room was a questionnaire ""how did we manage? If you did not give us a 10 (maximum) what can we do better to earn it?"" Got it? thats the level to expect. Better stop praising this, otherwise the prices will climb more...."
December 2014,Best hotel in London!,"When we first arrived at this hotel, I was a little leery because there was no lobby. The concierge is the first person you meet in a tiny little corridor. I was thinking to myself, what are we getting ourselves into!? We were taken upstairs to a lovely room where people were enjoying their breakfast. This room serves as the place to go for all of your dining needs. Great appetizers (complementary) at night and a nice selection of wines. You will not go hungry, their pantry is always stocked!  As we were getting checked in they offered us champaign. We were there very early from an overnight flight and they were able to accommodate us with a room immediately. We were so thankful. I can't say enough about the customer service. Every single person working there knew our names and…"
March 2015,Perfection!,"My 12 yr. old granddaughter and I stayed at Hotel 41 for 4 nights in the Balmoral Suites. The staff could NOT have been more helpful and caring...Knew our names, what we liked.. when I asked a question the staff - not only had an answer but - immediately took care of it. eg., what time to the Hop On, Hop off busses start?  The staff person offered to get us tickets. Time and time again this helpfulness happened.. I've traveled the world (135 countries)  and this is THE BEST hotel I've ever stayed in - for service."
March 2015,Not just raising the bar - consistently holding it high,"I'm a huge fan of Red Carnation hotels. If you want quintessential British with all the trimmings then no other luxury hotel chain does it so well - without kicking up a fuss. Many people (even Londoners) have never heard of places like Hotel 41, The Milestone or The Chesterfield. They are consistently in the top slots on Trip Advisor. Not because they are high tech bling or 'in' but because they have nailed it will brilliant staff who have been trained in the fine art of customer service. Red Carnation hotels aren't cheap but if you seek consistent quality , look no further. Hotel 41 has a button on the bedroom phoned marked 'anything, anytime'. It just about sums up the ethos of the entire Red Carnation business"
February 2015,Fantastic,"I can't praise this place too much. It epitomises going the extra mile. The location, room and general ambience were excellent, however it was the staff who really made the experience special. Nothing was too much trouble and their attention to detail was faultless."
March 2015,Cozy and Fabulous,"I have just spent a week in this  gorgeous Hotel. It is perfect in every way! The staff make this  hotel, they cannot do enough to spoil you. The rooms are beautifully appointed and the breafasts are gorgeous! I could list far more than 41 reasons to stay! Just book you won't be dissapointed!"
February 2015,Fantastic service and stay ,"Stayed here with the other half, we both thoroughly enjoyed our time here. Service was fantastic and someone was always there when required. Room service efficient and not intrusive. The whole decor of the place was amazing felt as if we was in a different country and not in London. This is one of the best hotels in London at the moment. Will be back again in the summer. Thanks "
February 2015,A very special place,From start to finish our stay was faultless. It's expensive but worth every penny. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The location makes this a true hidden gem in the heart of London. We will definitely be returning 
February 2015,Unbelievable!,"I can not even begin to write a review that would do Hotel 41 and staff justice.  The suite was stunning with views of the Palace Mews out of our windows.  There was nothing better than returning to our room in the evening, after a long day of sight seeing, to a fire and warm bath.  The staff were always warm and welcoming.  No matter the request, they never batted an eye and fulfilled it wonderfully. Our stay here was more like staying with long time friends than staying at a hotel.  The location was fabulous.  Easy walk to the underground, Victoria Station, Buckingham Palace, Harrods, The Victoria and Albert Museum, Big Ben and Westminster Abby.  Quick cab or Uber to other sights.  I hesitate to say more...I can't wait to return and don't want it to be fully booked!"
February 2015,Hidden Gem next to the Royal Palace,"Look carefully to find the unassuming entrance door to this hidden gem.  My husband and I stayed here one night to celebrate our 25th Anniversary.  From the moment you step in the door you feel like you're stealing away to someplace special.  The service was impeccable with attention to the tiniest of details.  There is always something delicious to eat available.  I am most impressed and grateful, however, that when we returned at midnight, I asked if they might have a spare contact lens case because I forgot mine . . . and they were able to provide me with one!!  That was a lifesaver.  I wish we were able to stay longer."
February 2015,Magical place,"This time to hotel 41 my daughter and I were celebrating her 21 birthday and the staff made sure she had an amazing stay . On greeting her they wished her happy birthday and in our room we found cake plus a card and balloon . The hotel is unique , you know your in london due to location but once your through the doors its another world hidden from outside . The personal touches from the staff are second to none and they make your stay memorable . We saw billy elliot and on our return found cupcakes and a programme . The quality of everything is outstanding and its just perfect in every way for me from staff to room to food and drink . The communications from hotel 41 are excellent they go the extra mile on everything . I am very hard to impress but they did it . My daughter 21…"
February 2015,beautiful,"This is my first time here, and the first thing i noticed is the hotel's nice decoration, especially at the lobby ... the kind of old school feel that i like! definitely suitable for all occasions ..."
February 2015,"""Paradise Lost?"" I believe I have found it!","We were fortunate enough to discover Hotel 41 in February of this year. I can only endorse every positive thing that has been written about this hotel. The place is absolutely beautiful,the rooms are gorgeous and spotlessly clean, the food is fabulous, the location fantastic, I could go on and on! However in my opinion what really makes this Hotel truly exceptional is the wonderful staff that they employ.,it is hard to believe that one hotel has managed to employ an entire staff who are truly exceptional in every way. We did not encounter a single member of staff who wasn't smiling and genuinely interested in making sure our weekend was as wonderful as possible. Well ladies and gentlemen you succeeded! Thank you all so much for making us so comfortable , so welcome and making…"
March 2015,Always a fantastic experience,This was our 3rd time at Hotel 41. Tube journey from Euston to Victoria a nightmare and the building work in Victoria horrendous and ugly. However the moment you step into the lobby of  Hotel 41 you  feel calm and so well looked after. Other hotels may be equally luxurious and well run but somehow  because it is smaller and individual you feel special. We are already talking about out next stay.
February 2015,One of the best ever.......,"I have just got back from a truly amazing stay at this fab hotel. We've stayed in some of the worlds best hotels and I can honestly say this was one of the best experiences we've ever had at a hotel. My husband booked this place as a birthday treat for me, after reading the reviews on here and I'm so glad he did. It was magical. On arrival we were greeted with a selection of champagne by the most attentive staff. We then had our room upgraded for nothing as my husband had informed them it was my birthday. We were given an amazing suite which was gorgeous in every way. The rooms really are exceptional. The decor & attention to detail is wonderful. They then arrived with a birthday cake (which was delicious) and fruit basket as a present. All of this in the 1st 30 mins! In the…"
April 2015,James Bond Might Hang His Hat Here,"We were in London for business and we started our stay at a traditional hotel in Chelsea for several days....deciding to upgrade our experience the final three days at Hotel 41.  This is the hotel for you if you seek top-notch service, elegant surroundings, and a central location for sightseeing. If it wasn't so pleasurable, it might be embarrassing to have so many staff members so warmly intent at meeting your every wish. As an example, we were enjoying a glass of champagne in the candle-lit lounge when I accidentally tipped over my champagne glass, breaking it and giving me a tiny cut in the process.  Within 60 seconds, our tabletop had been cleaned, I had a new glass of champagne in my hand, and I was wearing a bandage on my finger.  It was such a whirl of activity, I can't…"
April 2015,A hidden gem of London!,"The service at this hotel was the best I've experienced in Britain. Every staff member called me by name and were extremely friendly and polite. I had a wonderful experience at this hotel.  The hotel location was excellent, the rooms were nice and my overall experience was wonderful."
April 2015,My FAVORITE Hotel ever!,"We travel a lot and stay at lots of great places but this is the BEST experience I can remember having.  If you like to cruise and know the personal attention you receive from your attendants - this is similar.  The staff is amazing and couldn't do enough to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.  From the all day ""snack bar"" and drinks to rose petals and lit candles in our room - I can't think of one more thing they could have done.  I especially liked how even the tv remote and remote to the fireplace were in plastic sleeves marked sanitized.  They even have snacks packed for you to take with you on your long day tours.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone.  Wifi and breakfast every day made me feel like I wasn't getting charged for every incidental.  Hi Tea is a must if you…"
April 2015,The best hotel ever!!,"Everything is amazing at Hotel 41 - very professional, attentive and friendly members of staff, perfect service, great room and executive loundge, complimentary drink on arrival and complimentary food all day long and very personalised sevice full of surprises!! Thank you so much for making us feel so special - Stéphanie and Olivier"
April 2015,Another outstanding visit,"We stayed at the Hotel 41 three years ago and decided to return for another family vacation based on the fantastic service we had the last time.  I did not think it was possible that they could have exceeded our previous experience...but they did!  Monika, Florent, and the entire staff bent over backwards to make sure we had a wonderful holiday in London.   They truly pampered us and went out of their way to accommodate any request we had.  I can not say enough about this great boutique hotel in a prime area of the city."
April 2015,Exceptional,"We have never written a review on TA before; however, we felt that the fantastic experience we had at Hotel 41 was worth sharing. After being escorted to check –in, the staff were polite and friendly, affording us with their undivided attention. Prior to arrival we had put on our preferences form that our little stay at the hotel was a “mini-moon”, in response to this information the staff informed us that we would receive a complimentary upgrade to a suite, which was unexpected and a lovely surprise. The glasses of champagne that were served before going to our room enhanced the experience further.   The trip continued in this manner…  Both the Executive Lounge and the suite were immaculately clean and well-presented. The suite was wonderfully spacious and the two bathrooms…"
March 2015,"Wow, Wow, Wow amazing","Hotel 41 where do I start? Check in- 10/10 superb a complimentary glass of bubbles Room -10/10 was given an upgrade words can not  describe how lovely that was, fresh fruit, water, robes, slippers, everything you could possible want. The hotel offers complimentary drinks between 6-8pm the service is fantastic and your glass is never empty.  The complimentary food is fantastic so much to choose from hot and cold with deserts choices as well, again the service is second to none. The lounge area is very relaxing, with free wifi, papers magazines everything you could wish for, We were celebrating a very special occasion and when we returned to the room, there were candles lit, rose petals scattered around the room, soft music playing and a celebration cake provided, we certainly…"
January 2015,Wow -  A place I recommend to  friends,"When I stay in London, I stay at Hotel 41 - right across from Buckingham Palace. The staff is always excellent, they always help me get the best play tickets as well as dinner reservations at great restaurants. The rooms are spacious and cozy lounge is a great place to unwind after a busy day in the city. I have found the location to be excellent, coupled with excellent staff this is place in London I recommend to friends."
April 2015,Amazing Service,Spent the Eastern week end (3 nights) at the 41.  Fantastic service in a very cosy atmosphere.  The concierge booked us different London restaurant reservation with great attention and professionalism. I went to run with one of the team member who guided me in the different parks. The team has always a lot of attention for the guests.  Can only recommand it. Very weel located close to buckingham.
May 2014,Great customer service,"We were welcomed at door step and led to check in at the counter. Got a free champagne as the welcome drink. Room looks lovely and very clean. Traditional english style. First time received notes about the weather for the next day and recommendation of places to visit. Felt very good to see these little things done by the hotel. Well done! Staffs are very friendly and attentive, but for couples like my husband and I, we didn't really enjoy the attention. Overall, good quality room and service! Location is good too as we walk to most places for touristy visits."
March 2015,Unlike any other london hotel,This is a remarkable hotel......just a door off the street...no reception......booking in is accompliced in the executive lounge ....while relaxing and slurping a fine champagne ...the room ..the food are superb ...the attention to detail reminds me more of a far eastern hotel than  the normal london venue...then we get to the staff ...fantastic....my last word...just go
February 2015,Outstanding!!!,We stayed for just the one night for our anniversary. I was really looking forward to coming to the Hotel as the reviews are superb. They did did not disappoint.It was outstanding. I have not experienced service like this in a hotel in the UK. From the champagne when we arrived to the room upgrade I just loved the whole experience. Thank you to all the staff who made it very special. We will be coming back.
March 2015,Unforgettable Stay,"I had booked this hotel to propose my other half. I contacted the hotel several months in advance to see if they could assist me with arranging the music, roses, get our favorite champagne in the room and deal with numerous other details I was trying to get together. Their response from the start was amazing - every single thing was exactly how I had hoped for. They went for that extra mile by putting together a sound system that worked for my music - they didn't have this in place initially.  We got upgraded to a stunning room that was on two levels, had a lovely sitting area downstairs with a fire place and then bedroom and bathroom upstairs. Very large, super-comfy bed and two separate showers & large bath tub.  When we returned in the evening they had set everything ready as…"
February 2015,Best stay in the heart of London,"We were spending a weekend i London, and Hotel 41 was a perfect choice both because of its location and the ""boutique"" interior. We were welcome with the glass of champagne by the friendly and professional stuff. The room was big enough and the bathroom very comfortable. Gorgeous classical interior of the launch was just a prick over ""i"". Loved everything!"
March 2015,Two Nights of Indulgence,"Spent 2 nights here with my wife over the weekend and had an amazing time. The hotel feels small and personal, and the staff are incredible friendly, attentive knowledgeable and courteous.   Our room was wonderful with an extremely comfortable bed and a huge bath plus separate walk-in shower.  We really enjoyed the welcome drinks, the pantry and the honesty bar. Breakfast was excellent.  Location-wise its practically next door to Buckingham Palace so a great place to explore London from.   We have also stayed at The Ritz and The Savoy and this place is definitely up there with them, but with a bit more of a personal touch."
March 2015,Wonderful Experience!!,"My mother and I stayed at Hotel 41 for 3 days while we were visiting London and it was such an incredible experience. The room was delightful and large enough to accommodate both of us comfortably, the food was delicious, and above all, the service level provided by the staff was unparalleled. The staff is genuine, kind, incredibly attentive, and warm. They went out of their way to assist us with any needs we had (even going to lengths of going to the Starbucks down the street and picking out a mug as a souvenir for a friend when all I asked was if they could see if there was a Starbucks in the airport terminal) and to ensure that our stay was as pleasant and care free as possible. I really looking forward to returning to Hotel 41 and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a…"
March 2015,Wonderful Birthday Weekend,"Cannot speak highly enough of this hotel. Everything about it was perfect. The service was exemplary - nothing was too much trouble. The room was fantastic, every detail covered. It was the little things that made it though.... The birthday cake in the room, the upgrade to a suite for our special occasion, the champagne on arrival, the lit fire when we returned to our room in the evening and the complementary tea and scones just before we left for our return journey. We WILL be back!!!!"
February 2015,"Beautiful Accommodation, Great Location, Wonderful Staff","My wife and I spent four days last month at Hotel 41 in London, and very much look forward to returning!  Our room was attractive and comfortable.  The lounge was a great respite after a day of sightseeing and shopping with plenty to eat and drink.  The location was ideal whether walking, hailing a cab, or taking the Tube.  The staff was incredibly attentive, friendly, and helpful, whether with restaurant recommendations, directions, or virtually any question asked.  And they were wonderful to simply have a conversation with as well.  We had let them know in advance we were celebrating our anniversary and were very pleasantly surprised to find a celebratory cake awaiting us on arrival, as well as scattered rose pedals and votive candles throughout the room after dinner our first…"
March 2015,A little gem,"Seleted Hotel 41 from Tripadvsor reviews and I can confirm it justly deserves its position on the list.On arrival were speedily shown to the 5th floor executive lounge where the check in process is completed.Whilst we were being checked in we were offered a choice of champagne .We then spent some time enjoying the ambiance off he executive lounge with complementary nibbles and more champagne.When we were ready we were shown to our room 4104 the conservatory suite.Everything in the suite was explained to us nothing was rushed .The suite was incredible , arranged over 2 floors with a sitting room on the lower level with a nice couch a mini bar and TV also a toilet.On the upper floor a massive bedroom with the conservatory roof so you can sleep under the stars or close the blinds…"
March 2015,Fabulous and Personal,"Thank you so much to Hotel 41 for an amazing stay over my birthday.  The room was stunning and made even more so with the fire and rose petals in the evening!  Made our stay so special with all those personal touches, including theatre merchandise, roses, our fav magazines and a birthday cake!  Breakfast was absolutely delicious, were still talking about it.  Will definitely be coming back and recommending to friends and family alike!"
February 2015,A special celebration,We had a wonderful stay in this small luxurious hotel. With Victoria station near by it was easy to get to and handy for sightseeing. The staff could not have been more kind and helpful which made our stay extra special and one to remember.  The cooked breakfasts are very good.
February 2015,What a present!,Received an overnight booking as a gift. When we arrived we were greeted in such a professional way but made to feel like long lost friends. We were escorted to the Executive Lounge where we were offered champagne during the booking in procedures. We were delighted to receive upgraded accommodation to a suite and upon entry saw a celebration cake waiting for us. All that is written on the hotel web site and the gallery images give a true reflection of what is available. The food and service were amazing  We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to others.
February 2015,Outstanding!,"The location of this hotel is excellent. It's within short walking distance of Buckingham Palace and not far from Parliament Square. Easy walking distance (5 minutes or so) to Victoria Station. Gatwick Express takes 30 minutes and is about 40 pounds for 2 people.   The service at the hotel is exemplary. The ""whatever, wherever"" philosophy lives up to the highest expectations. Staff are ready and willing to assist at any time.   Continental breakfast was nice and also the option to order off the menu. 24 hour room service is available. Great snacks in the afternoon and in the evening as well in the executive lounge.   The bed was comfy and rooms were large for European standards. We used our sound machine (which we use at home) and didn't find noise to be a problem. Higher end…"
February 2015,This place is in a league of its own,"Just returned from a short stay the night before Valentine's Day.  My wife and I have stayed in most of the best hotels in London; this place is in a league of its own.  -Without exception, the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.  Not American style feigned obsequiousness in search of a large tip, not intrusive over the top badgering, just genuinely nice and happy people.   -The main dining room/lounge area had an incredibly relaxing vibe.  Imagine an old style stately home library with, during the day, the gently soothing music of a spa and at nighttime, equally relaxing piano jazz.  My wife and I arrived after a longish journey intent on checking in, going to our room, and not emerging until the morning - this place draws you in, and we ended up quite happily staying…"
February 2015,Five Star Gem,A five star gem in Victoria next to Buckingham Palace We could not fault this hotel it is absolutely amazing the staff are so friendly and welcoming and you feel like your meeting close friends. Nothing is any trouble and all the staff are charming The food and service is amazing the room is spotlessly clean and has a wonderful decor you feel like you're stepping back in time into a bygone age thank you to everyone for making our Valentine and Our10th anniversary so amazing we can't wait to come back and see you all again .The room was beautifully decorated for Valentine with lit candles and rose petals and it was so beautiful to come back too in the evening   Once again thank you to everyone for all their help and wonderful service we will see you all very soon thank you from…

February 2015,Perfect Boutique Hotel!,"Charming, sophisticated, cozy, unique - then add excellent service - beyond what you could even think possible - and you have 41 Hotel.  Just one floor full of rooms with a staff that is ready and willing to accommodate your every request.  They send you a pre-arrival form and I requested a birthday cake as a surprise for my husband and some roses.  I was then asked what type of cake, what did I want written on it, and when did I want it delivered - extremely detail oriented!  When we arrived from our dinner out that evening, our room was lit up with candles in each part of our room (including the bathroom) surrounded by rose petals, a delicious chocolate mousse cake (small, as requested), and beautiful turn down service.  I love that they put a hot water bottle between the…"
February 2015,Wow!!!,"If you are wondering where to stay in London this is the place. Service, Accommodation, Clean, Very Comfortable, all top notch one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. Executive lounge suite is a real treat. Cannot wait to go back . Well done to all staff you do a fantastic job."
January 2015,Perfect weekend stay in London,"My wife and I went to London for a weekend to celebrate her birthday. From the first second we were greeted with an amazing personal service and complimentary champagne. In the room awaited a complimentary birthday cake and a handwritten card. The room was delightful, with a good sized bathroom (not common in London.) The Lounge was elegant and cozy at the same time.  The staff was very helpful and attentive. They also helped obtain musical tickets and restaurant reservations beforehand. Plenty of small amazing details everywhere ensured a memorable stay in London. We are definitely coming back."
February 2015,"Delightful, best hotel ever","From the moment we arrived we felt very special, the attention to detail is second to none. I have been the hospitality sector for over thirty years, these people have had the best training and make each person feel at home.  They have the knack of just making you feel special and that they appreciate that you chose to book your stay with them.  I had a problem with my Mother that I had not realised had got worse before we arrived and they went way beyond what that should have or had to do, to ensure that our special time together was unforgettable.  It is truly a jewel in the crown and will always stay here when I visit London.   The price may seem high but you will know that it is every penny well spent.  Thank you all again for our magical stay"
December 2014,The Mini Moon of our dreams,"My new husband and I wanted to spend a couple of special days together immediately after our Christmas Wedding (December 2014). London was our choice and we were given many recommendations from friends but we really wanted to stay at a boutique hotel and found some great reviews for 41. How could we resist 'the most romantic hotel in London'? Our two nights at 41 were the highlight of our year and the most fantastic stay we've ever had at a hotel. The most perfect way to start our married life together. My husband and I were blown away by the wonderful service and attention to detail, from every single member of staff. We were addressed by name by everyone at all times and the welcome was lovely, with a glass of champagne. Nothing was too much trouble. We loved how the staff…"
April 2015,Nothing short of perfection,"Can I add anything to the excellent reviews already provided? No, not really but I feel that I am obliged to share our excellent stay with those who might be considering staying at the 41 - consider no further and go for it. You are very welcome there, genially welcome. Some of the rooms might be a bit on the small side (ours was great) but very well appointed and cater to needs you didn´t know you had. The staff is the best you come around in the hospitality business - nothing is to much ask, and by some miracle they manage to exceed the high expectations one has after reading the reviews. I read a small booklet they have on the RCH and as I understand the founder is very keen on her guests feeling special and happy about their stay. Well, Mrs Tollman, if you read this (which I…"
December 2014,top notch,"the attention is 5 star really, everything about this is pure class, it embraces the experience of the city inside its walls, the staff takes care of every detail and are really helpful, the rooms are stunning as well."
May 2014,Top Class,"So glad we chose to stay here it really is fantastic ,service is brilliant very kind and highly professional. Don't bother going elsewhere ,it's almost like having your own private stylish London residence in town. Excellent all round"
April 2015,Excellent Service and Great Location,"We were not familiar with this gem of a hotel when we booked it but they exceeded our expectations!  The entire staff including Monica, Remus, Gina, Julianna & Norbert to name a few made us feel at home during our stay.  The little details such as warm towels, turndown service, great snacks in the lounge as well as the service, location and attention to every need made us sad when it was time to leave.  We felt like family at this wonderful property.  The last minute assistance with theater tickets which were hand delivered to me, made me feel special and appreciated.  Thanks to the team at Hotel 41, our first London visit will not be our last!  Tom S"
April 2015,Unbelievable service!,"Based on the No. 1 rating on Trip Advisor, we decided to stay here for a few days following my wife's 50th birthday rather than fly abroad. We had very high expectations but these were not only met but exceeded on many occasions. We have never received service that is so good and so sincere anywhere else. I can only liken this to staying at the home of a  good friend who goes out of their way to make you feel comfortable and welcome in their home. There were so many things that made this special. From the time we arrived and were offered a choice of champagne from the champagne trolley to the time we checked out and were offered bottles of water for the journey as it was hot,  we were made to feel very special. We were surprised that a member of staff who we spoke to when we…"
April 2015,deserve to be treated like royalty,"Hotel 41 in London is an experience that everyone needs to have once in a lifetime if not many times over. The staff treated each and every person with high respect and made your stay feel like home. Each staff member knew your name and always asked about our days adventures.  Staying in the Conservatory Suite was amazing. We thank the staff for the roses, lit candles and rose petals on our return one evening - so romantic. We Will be back!"
May 2014,Amazing stay in London,"Little did I know that this trip was the trip my now husband was going to propose on. This hotel is in an amazing location and the service was incredible! Extremely comfortable rooms, and the staff was very helpful with making recommendations and getting reservations for dinner, theater etc. I definitely want to stay here again when I come back to London."
April 2015,Distinctly average,"This is not a 5 star hotel. I don't understand why it's so highly rated. We came here for our anniversary based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews but I was really disappointed. It is VERY small and very dark; the lobby, the lift, the rooms... small enough to claustrophobic. The lounge is a nice respite from all the closed in dark spaces but still too small for me to properly relax. No pool, no spa, no gym...  The staff are very helpful - really lovely even, but this is just not a 5 star hotel."
April 2015,home-away-from-home,"Our second visit here. We just love this little gem. The location is great. The staff and all the special touches adds to making this our first choice when staying in London. A beautiful lounge area, here you can find the best cuppa with all kinds of treats during the day. Breakfast is wonderful too."
November 2014,Shocked and more shocked,This hotel met all our needs. We stayed in the executive king suite. The bed was comfortable and soft. A little softer then I would like but I slept like a baby. Location was perfect. Close to Buckingham palace and tunnels. The staff was very educated of the history and area. The breakfast is a must! It was deligjtful . It could of been cleaner as I did come across some hair in bed and the shower. Over all it was a wonderful experience and we can't wait to return 
January 2015,Outstanding in every way,"What a wonderful hotel this is ! My husband and I recently spent the weekend here . A lovely warm welcome as we entered the hotel even though we had arrived quite early , the staff were so friendly and attentive throughout our stay . Amazing to get a choice of champagnes at check in , followed by canapés whilst our room was ready .  The executive lounge is so relaxing and homely and was never really busy or noisy , such a difference to the many London hotels we have stayed in .  We had booked an executive king room and found this to be a perfect size , nice big bath and separate shower , beautifully furnished and spotlessly clean . The bed was extremely comfortable and the choice of pillows included an aromatherapy one which I highly recommend . Breakfast in the lounge was…"
January 2015,Home away from Home- Perfection!,"From the warm, welcoming staff to the delightful ""nibbles"" always available, to the beautiful decor, this hotel felt more like a bed and breakfast. It is a short walk to Buckingham Palace and a quick jaunt to the Tube station. This wonderful hotel is absolutely delightful in every way, and we will not stay anywhere else from now on!"
January 2015,A wonderfully relaxing time,"Possibly the best hotel stay I have ever had whether for business or pleasure. Incredibly attentive, friendly and welcoming staff. Super comfy bed (always important even for one night!) and nice bedroom.  We could have whiled away the whole of Sunday reading the papers by the fire in the Executive Lounge. Will definitely be returning."
January 2015,Unbelievable Service. Perfect stay. Beautiful and Clean.,"I've stayed at the Intercontinental, the Sheraton Park Lane, the Cavendish St. James and a number of others. Nothing compares to the level of service you'll find at this wonderful, cozy and friendly hotel. Everything was clean and in order and the accommodations were excellent in every respect. Great location too. Thanks so much to the awesome staff. Nice job!"
January 2015,The Best Hotel in 25 Years of Travel,"The experience of ""41"" begins with a warm welcome from the Concierge and your car whisked away for parking, The reception by the hotel staff is second to none, very attentive and exceptionally polite. Our stay was to celebrate my partners birthday, the room was wonderful, a small piece of cake was a thoughtful gesture and the flowers ordered were of good quality. The ambience is wonderful it is like apartment living with the lounge the main gathering place. All requested reservations had been made and nothing too much trouble. The afternoon tea was really good, a great selection of sandwiches, pastries and scones.  Above all every staff member was so polite, addressed you by name and a great asset to this hotel. For anyone wanting the best hotel experience in London this is the…"
January 2015,Fantastic,"One of the best hotel I've nevere used. fantastic, with an excellent service and romantic room. The hotel is near to all major famous places of London. A perfect location to start to visiting and living London."
December 2014,"Small, Personable Stay","We stayed at Hotel 41 the week between Christmas and New Years Eve. The rooms were elegant and clean (but watch your head in the loft if you're very tall!). The staff were all exceedingly friendly and helpful, making arrangements and suggestions each night of our visit. Because it's a small hotel, you quickly feel as though the staff knows you. For example, each time we left the hotel on an outing that the staff helped arrange, someone at the door recognized us and handed us an envelop with printed walking directions and (if needed) confirmations. Very handy!  The location was also perfect. We would definitely stay at Hotel 41 again!"
May 2014,One of the best,"I've been fortunate enough to stay in some amazing hotels around the world, but few are as personable and memorable as 41.  You'll be greeted with champagne, treated like an individual rather than a room number, and lavished with incredible luxury throughout your stay. Pricey (as expected), but worth it."
January 2015,Simply Stunning ....,"Wow,  just returned from two nights at 41,  it is a truly a stunning hotel.  The Staff are friendly, attentive and nothing is too much. I have been fortunate enough to stay in some great hotels but none as good as 41.  The location is great for travelling round London and despite being next to the main road it is quiet.  no road noise, no doors banging and then there is the food,  just fab with a great pantry that is worth visiting.  a lot of other hotels could do with visiting 41 and just learning what hospitality is about.  my thanks to all the staff who looked after us. Highly recommended"
February 2015,Perfection,"I stayed here with my good friend for my birthday treat and they really go the extra mile. It is my favourite place in the world. Nothing is too much trouble and the food, ambience, rooms, service and location is flawless. Thank you so much again for the best stay ever. We did not want to leave ever. "
February 2015,Everything about this hotel is first class. ," Everything about this hotel is first class. Have stayed several times and once again we were not disappointed. We really enjoyed our first stay with the hotel so much so that we extended it by three days! The staff was very helpful in particular. They were very helpful answering questions as well as making recommendations. There were lovely setting, clean and spacious room. Food is excellent. The spa is way above all others I have visited. I had great time. Also, there was a lovely afternoon tea. Thanks a lot and I will definitely come back."
February 2015,London's hidden flawless diamond,"The perfect London hotel. We spent the weekend with our two dogs, Archie & Gretel. From the moment we arrived, nothing was too much trouble and our every need anticipated - including those of Archie & Gretel - who enjoyed a freshly cooked breakfast!. I am accustomed to fine hotels - but the mixture of quality, atmosphere and general 'je ne sais quoi' of 41 is simply unmatched."
February 2015,perfect,"So this is it. The perfect hotel. A small 5 star, personal service, great bedding, a lounge area making you really feel at home. Admitted, all this doesn't come cheap. But compared to other London hotels and the experience on offer, it really feels like great value for money. Ps: try the breakfast pancakes with fresh berries ... Heaven. "
January 2015,A wonderful night away!,"My husband and I got married just before Christmas and are not going on honeymoon until June, so my new hubby treated me to a night here and a trip to the theatre.  I know he put a lot of effort into finding somewhere very special for us to stay and it really was special!  Prior to our arrival he liaised with the hotel to arrange for us to arrive a little earlier that usual so we could make the most of our night away from the kids and they were happy to oblige.  We were greeted with hot chocolate in the foyer...which in January was very much appreciated!  We were then shown to the main reception desk and presented with champagne...so the hot chocolate got ditched in favour of this!!  We were absolutely spoilt and upgraded to the Balmoral Suite, which was quite frankly the most…"
February 2015,Enjoyable and relaxing birthday visit,"To celebrate my husband's birthday we spent Valentine's weekend at ""41"".   We booked having read reviews on tripadvisor but were still impressed by how welcoming and relaxing the whole experience was.    The atmosphere in the guest lounge reminded us of something of a cross between a club lounge and the library of a manor house.  All of the staff were attentive and friendly, and genuinely gave the impression that nothing was too much trouble.  The ""home from home"" impression was reinforced by the small touches - free ice cream and chocolate truffles turning out to be a particular favourite for my husband, for me it was the hot water bottle at turndown!   We are already planning to return for another weekend later in the year."
February 2015,Outstanding!!!!!!,"I suprised my boyfriend for his 30th Birthday with a stay at this hotel, Id read the reviews about the hotel but I must say our stay here supassed all expectations I had. From the second We walked in the customer service was exceptional. There was not one single fault in our entire stay. If you are planning a special occasion I would reccomend this hotel and will be reccomending this hotel to all my friends and family. You can tell that YOU are at the heart of what they do. Its amazing words can not fully explain how impressive this place is.  Thank you to everyone who made our stay such an enjoyable experiance."
January 2015,Unbelievable,It takes a lot to be the best hotel in London! Number 1! For a reason! Just go....just go!!!!! Amazing!!!!!!!the staff the service the professionalism the rooms the food the drinks the everything - is perfection 
February 2015,A hidden masterpiece,"When you travel in London and you use Black cabs it is unusual for the cabbie not to know your destination . Hotel 41 is one of these hidden gems in London . Exclusivity is their byword . Unlike a normal hotel lobby you have to be "" buzzed"" in . Greeted by a receptionist who takes your details and then calls someone down to escort you to the Fith floor where the hotel is situated .  From the moment you arrive the service and attention to detail never ceases to amaze. Nothing was to much trouble for the friendliest staff I have encountered .  An all day buffet , breakfast , lunch and dinner superb . Rooms extremely comfortable . This is like staying in a private club.  One of the best hotels ever ."
February 2015,Speechless,"It's taken me some time to find the words to adequately describe this hotel.  I almost don't want to write about it, so as to keep it my secret.  However, the property and people deserve the praise.  Unfortunately, my wife and I were only able to stay here one night.  We were finishing up an anniversary trip, and in that one night the staff made a lasting impression.  We were placed in the Conservatory Suite (complete with a special happy anniversary cake), which rendered us speechless.  The level of service, the professionalism, and the hospitality shown by all staff members is unparalleled.  From the moment we walked in the door, to the moment we left, we felt like we were royalty.  The Executive Lounge is the star of the property.  It's where you check in/out, enjoy afternoon…"
December 2014,5/5 isn't enough - 100/100,"We stayed early December 2014. Not only would I say this is the best hotel in London, I'd say it's the best hotel I've stayed in in the UK and Europe.  We stayed for our 10 year anniversary. We checked in and sat in the lounge while the excellent staff sorted our room.  We was shown to the room where all our belongings was waiting, with a happy anniversary card.  The hotel is totally stunning, and I see a lot of buildings as a surveyor. Everything is spotless. The food is second to none, and the restaurant next door, Bbar, - wow.  I cannot thank all the staff enough for making our stay a totally amazing experience.   My only regret is not being able to thank all the members of staff that we had the pleasure of meeting during our 4 day stay. We will definitely be returning to…"
December 2014,Nine days (and nights) in heaven,"After reading the rave reviews online, we decided to give this hotel a try.  It was even better than we had hoped for.  From the welcome with champagne to our final breakfast before our departure, we were treated like royalty.  (The hotel is literally just down the street from Buckingham Palace, and at times, we could swear that we must actually be guests of the Queen, staying within her private domain.)  The atmosphere is one similar to that of a fine gentlemen's club in the Saint James district.  The main room, called the Executive Lounge, is filled with beautiful mahogany furniture and features comfortable seating, a cozy fireplace, and a very attentive staff always available to help.  The service is outstanding but understated.  Help seems to appear magically just as it is…"
January 2015,Simply a fabulous hotel with an exceptional staff,"My wife and I along with our 2 children (in their early 20's), checked in to the Hotel 41 on New Year's Day for a 4 night stay.  Upon entering the hotel, the staff led us to the lounge where we were warmly greeted and introduced to the wonderful comforts one will find there.  A beautiful wood paneled interior, exceptionally comfortable furniture, a warm fireplace all greet the senses.  As others have alluded to, the food was excellent and was unlimited in the evening.  Our suite and room were spacious and appointed beautifully.  From the hot water pouch in the bed for warmth to the wonderful jacuzzi and spacious shower, there was little if anything that was lacking in our suite.    As great as the location, the beautiful interiors and amenities, the staff is what really…"
December 2014,Perhaps the best hotel experience we've ever had,"We stayed for a week over New Years holidays.  Everything was absolutely superb.  Every single staff member at the hotel was extraordinary and went out of their way to make sure our needs were being met.  There is nothing we would suggest to improve the service or the quality of the experience.  I do not know if all Red Carnation hotels are of similar quality, but I can confidently assert that none are better.  Yes, it is fairly expensive, but worth every pound.  We hope to go back as soon as we can!"
December 2014,Feeling like a King and Queen,"Despite this Hotel being located next door to Her Majesty the Queen of England, the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty by staff and management. The Hotel interior is simply amazingingly royal and British. Warm friendly atmosphere greets you n arrival and leaving is like leaving home. We booked a delux King room of which was simply flawless. Bathroom had bath and shower separated. The shower was always hot and fast flowing. Bed was like sleeping on a cloud, with attention to detail in room facilities we haven't experienced before in London or many places. An open gas coal fire in room made it all that more cozy.  The central lounge area served for both breakfast dining and relaxation. Its huge ornate wood fixings, carpet, mezzanine floor made the ambiance very honely…"
July 2014,Beautiful Place.,"Hotel 41 is a beautiful hotel in London and definitely one to stay in. Anyone who's looking to stay in London I would recommend Hotel 41. Great hotel and at a very good price. The rooms, the view, the staff, the food, the service that you get is excellent."
July 2014,Simply the Finest!!!,"Certainly a jewel in London's hotel crown.  Like a private club.  Buckingham is just down the street. Rooms are beautifully appointed with every convenience.  The Exec Lounge is fantastic.  But the true excellence of 41 is its staff and their superb service.  The hotel's website is quite accurate, but doesn't do the 41 experience justice."
December 2014,Not quite as good as our first stay,"We recently returned from our second stay at the 41 Hotel, this time for 7 nights. We enjoy the 41 for its friendly staff and wonderful amenities. The location about a 5 minute walk to both Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station is fantastic. We also like that it’s about a 20 minute walk to either Hyde Park or Westminster Abbey. This review will compare our December 2014 stay to our 2011 stay a bit.  We requested, and got, the same room that we had last time. We like the spacious room that overlooks the Royal Mews and the large bathroom with a wonderful, deep tub and a separate shower.      Upon arrival, we were greeted by the friendly doormen from the neighboring Rubens and  escorted upstairs to the check-in desk. The champagne while checking in is nice! We enjoyed seeing the…"
December 2014,There should be another category above EXCELLENT?,The title of my review say it all but since I need 200 characters I will also state that I would challenge anyone to find a more service oriented staff. From the moment you arrive on the 5th floor you are at HOME!
December 2014,Fabulous hotel,"After seeing this hotel as number 1 on tripadvisor, we booked for 3 nights and have not been disappointed. From emails to check our preferences before arrival to the wonderful staff who have looked after us during our visit, I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. The lounge is wonderful to relax in after a hectic day out, the choices of meals are great and saves having to leave the hotel for dinner if you don't wish to. The difference between this hotel and many other great ones we have stayed in previously, is that they have thought of everything for you and nothing is too much trouble for them- many other hotels make this claim however in hotel 41 case, it is genuine as the staff team want to do everything they can to make your stay in London amazing. This will be our…"
January 2015,Amazing,"I stayed here as a birthday treat for my girlfriend on 24/1/15 and could not have picked a better choice. There is not one thing about this hotel that could be improved and I will certainly be staying here again, I felt like a celebrity from start to finish!  Highly recommend!"
December 2014,Feels like home!,"This was our 3rd Christmas at 41 and we really didn't want to leave, so much so that we ended up extending our stay.  Special mention to Lauren, Monika and Florent for making the stay so memorable and fun, but the whole 41 team as always were fantastic.  They make you feel like returning friends rather than guests and had organised a lovely anniversary surprise for us in the room when we checked in. Consistently excellent service and the best hotel beds we've ever slept in!  41's location is great, it's just a short walk through the park to some great shopping streets and an excuse to feed the local squirrels! Can't wait for next Christmas!"
November 2014,Wonderful Experience,"My stay at Hotel 41 was such a treat, I cannot recommend highly enough.  The care provided by the staff was absolutely top notch.  The rooms are very comfortable, well appointed and surprisingly spacious for central London.  The reception area was such a nice and comfortable amenity.  Staying here was truly a retreat from the hustle of London just outside.  The location was excellent, just a short walk to Buckingham Palace and Victoria station.  It was a great place to stay while exploring London.  For being a luxury hotel, they had a lot of items included, that seem to be how other nice hotels nickel and dime the overall experience.  Snacks, water, soft drinks...really nice touch.  London can be quite expensive, if you can get a competitive rate at Hotel 41, don't hesitate, you…"
January 2015,100% recommend,"Stayed one night in this hotel . The room was big and it had comfy bed . We had great and sound sleep . The staff were friendly and helpful , we would use this hotel again !! 100% recommend. Mr & Mrs Murray "
January 2015,Everything a luxury hotel should be.,"An amazing hotel. Anyone running a five star hotel should be a guest here to see how it should be done. The check in was painless, helped along with a glass of champagne, the bar is like a modern gentlemans club crossed with a country house library.  Superb attentive service by staff who frankly have to be chosen for their good looks,as they were all drop dead gorgeous!  The continual supply of delicious canapes helps the excellent selection of malt whisky go down.  The rooms are fantastic, modern stunning interiors with little touches that make a difference. Bose wave sound system, roaring fire, hot water bottles in the bed. I,would have been very happy to move in.  My new favourite hotel in London, I can't wait to go back."
February 2014,A rare gem,"Hotel 41 is small but it doesn't matter as the service is impeccable and the little touches are amazing.  In winter there is a wonderful fireplace in the lounge.  There is a home-styled kitchen where you can help yourself to delicious treats from icecream to fruit to sweet and savoury snacks whenever you feel like it.  in the later afternoon we were treated to free champagne and snacks.  And instead of a chocolate on your pillow each night - you choose your little gift from a basket which includes some adorable items I still use. I loved this hotel - it is central, reasonably priced and different.  I have stayed in five star London hotels that don't come close to the outstanding service here."
January 2015,Fantastic hotel wonderful stay,The staff could not have been  more friendly and helpful we had a wonderful time celebrating my belated birthday. I can't wait to go back and stay longer it was such an easy place to get to  aswell the restaurant recommendation that the made was also first class .afternoon tea was a delight
November 2014,Instantly relaxing,"I booked hotel 41 for my partners birthday and have to say we had the most relaxing, chilled out time ever in a London hotel. We were checked in to our room in the lounge and offered a glass of champagne, and that's where we stayed for the next 3 hours!! Absolute bliss. Everything here was perfect for us, attention to detail is unbelievable. When we walked in there was lots of sweets and goodies by the front door and I said the kids would have loved that. At check out we were presented with two bags full of sweets for our children, nice touch:))"
May 2014,Almost fit for royalty,"What an exquisite place! I love the attention to detail in the decor, and the lovely staff that genuinely do want to go the extra mile to make your stay memorable. This is one of the rare few places where the demeanor of the staff is genuinely amicable, rather than getting the vibe of they are just being nice because they are paid to do so. I never felt the generic manufactured "" friendliness "" feeling from the staff. My only caveat with this place is that the staff although well meaning, do sometimes get a little intrusive by way of watching you at all times which is akin to a security guard watching you. This is something which is antithetical to an otherwise wonderful hotel. There is a fine line between being attentive and being intrusive. Other than this, i'm a big fan!"
January 2015,The best Hotel in London,"We will never forget the Hotel 41!  It is the best Hotel in five stars.  All is clean, British decoration, beautiful.  All the staff is perfect, each one work perfectly and they are friendly.  The staff is like a second family.  Do not forget the Valet, perfect service.  We have a marvellous souvenir for the very warm welcome with the bottle of Champagne and the surprise, a birthday cake for Eddy !  Victoria, our cat liked very much the staff, especially the lady who came everyday to clean the room I think, Victoria did not want to leave the room the last day.  All the staff took care of her with many kindness.  We loved the dining-room, the ambiance and lovely music, the meals were delicious, we discovered a nice coconut soup, and the famous afternoon tea, It was magic.  We…"
February 2014,"Does not live up to the reviews, nosey staff","We stayed 10 nights at this hotel based on the positive reviews we had read on trip advisor. We were very disappointed. The staff are incredibly nosey. My introverted wife felt too uncomfortable venturing into the common room for snacks on her own as she found the staff too intrusive. They always want to generate a lengthy conversation with you even though you can be visibly tired or uncomfortable. We knew they were trying to be friendly, but you really feel imposed upon every time you step into the common area.   Also, our sleep was terrible. Initially our room (which was tiny) had such a loud compressor outside that I couldn't get to sleep. We had to ask for a room change (which they provided). This second room was much larger. However, we never got to sleep in as the staff…"
December 2014,Brilliant,"Me and my wife stayed here just before christmas, and can honestly says it really is amazing, from the minute you walk through the door, you feel welcome lovely check in really friendly staff, and explain everything you need to know. We had dinner the first night and the food is delicious! Real 5 star service. So all in all a lovely stay here, and will be recommending to my friends."
January 2015,Best service I've ever experienced,"The hotel is comfortable, well decorated and reasonably well positioned in Victoria. What sets it apart is the service. It's amazing. I travel a lot with work and have stayed in excellent hotels all over the World. This really stands out. They anticipate your needs and are generous with their champagne, snacks and excellent coffee. They are also friendly and very helpful. We had a wonderful time."
December 2014,Superb Position and Service,I first wrote a review on Hotel 41 about 4 or 5 years ago and could not stop recommending it to everyone that I knew.  We had the opportunity to return in December whilst doing some Christmas shopping in London and it is as magnificent as ever!  We stayed in a Junior Suite and I would like to share our experiences as follows: Location:  Hotel 41 is situated in Buckingham Palace Road and is just around the corner from Buckingham Palace.  We never caught cabs anywhere as it is so easy to walk to places such as Hyde Park and Harrods.  Longer walks would include walking to Fortnum and Mason - totally lovely! The staff:  We had not been there for two years and were so happy to see familiar faces at the reception desk.  The friendliness and the helpfulness of the staff cannot be…
October 2014,I would stay here every time if we could afford it,If you want to stay in a friendly small five star hotel this is it. Pampered from the moment you step inside the staff are there just for you. The hotel is quite small and distinguished. Don't expect flashy lobby pool and gym! Expect discerning and classic high end service. The staff will help you with everything and will all know what you are doing and be interested in you having a great holiday and experience. The rooms are classic and comfortable and have plenty of space. The bathroom was clean and big enough with a bath and separate shower. Opposite Buckingham Palace and close to the action in London. Food and snacks laid on all day and into the evening. How lovely to go out and get back yo the hotel for a coffee and light snack before bed! And you don't get hit with a bill…
October 2014,Another Perfect Stay At London's Hidden Gem,"My mother and I managed to meet in London for a lovely three-day girly break prior to my first wedding anniversary, and since this is very rare for us (we currently live at other ends of the earth), I insisted that we stay somewhere very special. Like many Trip Advisor fans, I chose Hotel 41 based on others' reviews. This is the first time my expectations have been truly exceeded. The ever-lovely assistant manager Monika is a gem! When we were in the USA, I tried unsuccessfully to book London theatre tickets on my Australian credit card and I emailed her ahead of our stay to ask her to book them for us which she did. She also easily secured a table for me and my husband for our first wedding anniversary for the following week at Belmond Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons which is…"
October 2014,Excellent,"There is very little I can say that I haven't already said about this wonderful property. The staff perfectly exemplify never-say-no hospitality, with each and every member of staff taking the time to better know and understand their guests. The dining was excellent as always, as were the provisions on the pantry.  Overall another lovely stay at 41 and I will no doubt return."
October 2014,EXCELLENT jewel in London!,Stayed for our anniversary. The staff couldn't be more helpful and welcoming. Our room was small but comfortable and had everything you could possibly need. Only had breakfast but couldn't fault it. Will definitely stay again and would recommend to anyone.
October 2014,Overdue review!,"Hotel 41 is a lovely jewel in London.  Fantastic location near Buckingham Palace!  Amazing service, food, rooms...PURE GRACIOUS HOSPITALITY!!!!  It feels like home!  From the champagne welcome throughout each day's amenities, Hotel 41 has it all.  A quiet, lovely respite in the midst of busy London!"
October 2014,Posh and service-oriented hotel very close to Buckingham Palace.,"I've stayed here with my wife at least 20 times in the last few years, and will always look to 41 first when booking a place for myself or friends.  While the amazing rooms and common spaces come as standard and outshine the other top hotels in London, it is the personal service and welcoming team looking after us during our stays that always stand out.    They remember us by name, face, and even voice on the phone after years between bookings!  They know what we like and don't like, and prepare our room accordingly in advance whenever we are staying there.  For example, at my wife's suggestion, they provide a free standing full length mirror which is already in situ when we get to our room (the ladies will appreciate this, I am led to believe).    Simply a super hotel with all…"
October 2014,Wonderful,"The staff are excellent at the hotel- everyone gets to know you and tries to assist you in any way they can. The rooms are comfortable and well-appointed. Soft towels and comfortable sheet/bedding.  There is a lounge area which is stocked with drinks and snacks 24 hours a day and that offers meals and cocktails as well as tea. The room we booked had air conditioning problems the first night of our stay and the staff moved us to a new room that was larger and even more beautiful. They gave us complimentary champagne and waived our first night's charge because of the AC problem. While we were at dinner, the staff lit candles and placed rose petals throughout our room . They went well above and beyond our expectations. We will definitely return!"
October 2014,Very very excellent.,"I stayed at this lovely hotel last week and it was a truly superb and decadent experience.  As soon as you walk in the door you feel taken care of.  The executive lounge and the rooms themselves are luxurious and you feel totally pampered.  From check in with champagne, to the plunder the pantry, there was nothing that was missed.  The staff is wonderful and they pay close attention to detail.  My room was lovely with a view of the Royal Mews.  Located about a 5 minute walk from Victoria Station, I was able to navigate the tube to all the wonderful landmarks.  I will definitely be visiting again and I can see why they earned this rating on trip advisor.  Truly a classic elegant hotel.  Can't wait to visit again."
August 2014,Fantastic Hotel!!,IT ios in the prime place for a hotel and the rooms are spotless. The staff treat you well and it deserves all the acclodaes that it has received. All the services are propt and friendly. Not a big hotel but the roomsc are a fair size. Hotels in London are expensive.
September 2014,Stunning luxury!!,"Two weeks ago my husband, my son and me, we were at the Hotel 41, and everything was perfect, in the 3 days we stayed there.. The big smile in our arrival, the welcome cocktail, our amazing suite!! The cozy lobby and the great service in all our request, every one was promptly resolved and always with an incredible attention and great smile.  Usually we are going to London 3 times a year, And this was our first visit to the Hotel 41, was great we did it!..  For sure in our next visit to London,  we will back to this beautiful and charming Hotel !!  Thank you Piero, Remus, Simone, Paula, Yohann, Mitchel and Stefanie, every one of you made to us feeling like at home with all your attentions and great service!!  Marcela F."
December 2014,Fantastic&romantic,"Very nice little butique hotel with helpful stuff. Room was very cosy, with fireplace and comfort bed. Location was the best. It was only couple hundred metres away from Buckingham Palace and short walk away from Victoria bus station. Hop on-hop off bus station was almost in front of the hotel. Loved to spend our christmas time there, hotel lobby was also very cosy and stuff spoiled us a lot. Definately will visit again."
January 2015,51st Wedding Anniversary,"This has to be the best hotel in London,we were celebrating our 51st anniversary and spent one night at Hotel 41.From the moment you enter the hotel and receive the unique registration format (crudités and champagne) to the exceptional room facilities, it's the first hotel We have visited that have sanitised TV controls in sealed plastic bags.We would also congratulate the highly professional and friendly staff. Do visit Hotel 41 it's amazing!"
January 2015,A hidden treasure,What a find!! We stayed for two nights and we had a great time. We were met by the doorman as we pulled up. Luggage taken into the hotel and the car was whisked away. We were greeted by name by the staff who were really attentive. If you're not used to it you could feel a little overwhelmed but with only 28 rooms the staff have plenty of time to look after you. We had a glass of champagne whilst we were checking in and complimentary snacks whilst we waited for our room. The executive lounge is very tastefully laid out and never too busy so it feels like you're in an exclusive club. Be aware that although the snacks and cold drinks are free the tea and coffee that they offer certainly aren't and are added onto the bill without a word....no slip to sign so we were surprised when…
January 2015,Discreet and exceptional service.,"We had 2 nights here for a birthday weekend of shopping and partying. The service for us is unrivalled and we are used to being spoiled having recently stayed in the Savoy and the Sanderson. Loved the executive lounge, really can't wait to return to spend a little more time making the most of it. Thankyou to all of the staff for a wonderful stay."
February 2014,Ultra High Quality,"Stayed here in February 2013 in a fantastic two-floor room. Entrance through a nice seating area with a fireplace, spacious bedroom in the top floor. Nice 1920's surroundings in the lounge, breakfast is generous and the afternoon canapés is a feature rarely seen in London establishments."
December 2014,A JEWEL OF THE CROWN,"A JEWEL OF THE CROWN  (IN THE MOST LITERAL SENSE OF THE EXPRESSION ! )  Following the online reservation of rooms on the website for 3 nights of the Hotel, communication with the staff prior to arrival was most informative and kind, helpful and attentive to all our requests. I had planned this journey for my partner’s birthday and I could already feel that the staff paid attention to every wish I would formulate. Moreover, they arranged for private transfer to pick us up from the airport upon arrival, as indeed I had requested.   As soon as we arrived at the hotel, Mr Malcolm Hendry, General Manager, came outside to greet us and even kindly helped us with our luggage himself (!!). Once we got into the ground-floor hall we knew we would absolutely love the place. Mr Hendry told…"
December 2014,the secret hotel,"This was our first stay here and I chose it soley due to trip advisor high reviews .I didnt expect it to be as amazing , unique and individual as it is . It is hidden away from view and doesnt even look like a hotel . The entrance gives you a feeling of glamour whilst the lift takes you up 5 floors to the sctual hotel . On check in the staff are friendly  professional and charming , nothing is to much trouble . The rooms exudes glamour and are striking in black and white with more than enough facilities . The bathrooms are perfect for relaxing , whilst everything including the toothbrush is provided for you . The service hotel 41 provide is second to none .They have an excellent array of food and drink plus plunder the pantry is a welcome sight at the end of a long day in london…"
December 2014,A very warm 'hot chocolate' welcome!,"We booked this boutique hotel solely because of its Trip Adviser #1 ranking and were not disappointed.  From the moment we arrived, we began to understand how this small ""top floor"" hotel close to Buckingham Palace (that even the black cab drivers haven't heard of) had earned this prestigious ranking. The staff, without exception, were super friendly and professional and we were made to feel very special.  The hotel's heart is the 'lounge' which we loved. There are lots of complimentary candy and snacks throughout the day, which was perfect for us as we were out for much of our time, shopping and site seeing. Having stayed in lots of top 5 star hotels - particularly in Asia (which are always world beating) we tend to stay away from such branded hotels in the west as we always…"
December 2014,Once again No 41 delivers,"We continue to run out of wonderful things to say about this hotel and its outstanding staff.  They have once again made my wife and i's annual London trip perfect.  From the free flowing champange when you arrive to the tea by the fireside before you leave everything was done with a friendly smile, a kind word and genuine customer care.  The attention to detail is exceptional, especially for returning guests (thank you for the strawberries) and sets the bar over and above 5* standard.  It is not a cheap option but its incredibly good value.  We'll be back."
December 2014,Fabulous special weekend,"This is the 3rd time we have stayed at 41 and we took some friends for a special birthday celebration. The welcome we received was lovely and we and more importantly our friends were really well looked after for the whole weekend. The rooms are beautiful, the lounge and well stocked plunder pantry are wonderful and the service brilliant! Can't wait until we can go again."
December 2014,Wonderful hotel,"Our 2 night stay last week was amazing and everything that has been said in previous reviews is well and truly the truth.The staff at 41 do go the extra mile for everyone and you are made to feel special.I have been raving about 41 since I returned to work.Unfortunately as it was a treat from work I don't think we would be able to afford to go again,but at least we had the chance to sample perfection.Thank you to all the staff for an incredible 2 days."
December 2014,"Authentic Luxury, Authentic Service","My wife and I came to experience relaxation and comfort. We found authentically attentive (at this level we all know the difference) staff, who were so very kind. They couldn't do enough for us. From the doorman to Lauren Hargrave, Resident Manager, every member of staff gave a luxurious service to go with the 5*+ hotel.  Hotel 41 really is the centre of authentic luxury in the centre of London.   There are so many extra treats, and I'd love to share them here, but you really want to experience the surprise of it all. Trust me it's wonderful.   Our room was fabulous and we would love to stay there every time we return, which we surely will whenever we are in London. (Move over Dorchester) Hotel 41 is our new home from home.   Thank you all at Hotel 41. See you soon."
December 2014,Exceeded my expectations,"First, this hotel is not for the bargain traveler. But, it it worth every cent. Good location in central London with short walk (5min)  to Victoria Station. But equally easy to walk to all the other locations in London. Small boutique hotel with very very personalized service. The entire staff should be commended for thier attentiveness and friendliness. I would stay at Hotel 41 again and again.  I was visitng London for business/leisure."
December 2014,Our new number one favourite London hotel,"Stayed one night in mid-December as part of my birthday celebrations. From the moment we arrived we were treated to a master-class in customer service. At the reception, in the Executive Lounge, we were offered a choice of complimentary (vintage and non-vintage) champagnes. Our suite, on two floors, was very special indeed. After our theatre trip, we indulged in some terrific fresh snack foods in the beautifully seasonally-decorated lounge. Once back in our room we were met with a very romantic trail of rose petals and a crackling fire.  We slept very soundly and (after the best power-shower ever) had a very tasty breakfast with porridge to die for. Even after we checked out, we were invited back after our trip for some more treats.  We'll definitely be back next time we're…"
December 2014,Exceptional service,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for our anniversary in December, from the moment that we arrived I knew that I had made the right decision in booking Hotel 41. We were greeted by the door staff who welcomed us by name, then took us through to the lounge for checking in, we were offered a glass of (good) champagne and the lovely Lauren chatted with us about our plans for the weekend, offering assistance with taxi's, directions and even offering to book a local hairdressers for me. The rooms were beautifully appointed, gorgeous furniture and fixings and one of the best beds Ive slept in. When we returned in the evening they had turned down our room with candles, music and rose petals, such a lovely touch. My favourite memory of the weekend will be returning to the lounge, sitting by the…"
December 2014,Many Happy Returns,"It's a little while since we stayed.  We are pleased to see the management team remains the same, which is unusual in London hotels, and we always receive a warm welcome back.  The consistency of the product and service is always first class.  The canapes and Plunder the Pantry offerings for the winter season are impressive, and they have even increased the choice of soap gifts at Reception.  The downstairs departure offering too, is lovely, with chocolate truffles to die for, other choices of sweets and savouries, and water and/or good coffee to take away for your journey.  Other hotels simply do not give these things away within the price. The hotel looks great for Christmas and we were pampered as always.  Our thanks to all the team, and see you in 2015!  C&L"
December 2014,By far the best hotel we have ever stayed at!,"A couple of years back while on vacation at Disneyland, my family won the grand prize giveaway  which was a night stay in Disneyland's Dream Suite(above the Pirates of the Caribbean ride and originally build as Walt Disney's private apartment)  plus VIP treatment during our stay.  It was a once in a life time experience!!  My husband and I just returned from our trip to London where we stayed at the Hotel 41 and I would describe it was the same sort of Hotel experience as Disneyland's Dream Suite.  From the moment we arrived we were pampered!  They have thought of every detail and it shows!  The location was great, walking distance to many must-see sights and right across the street from Buckingham Palace.  The breakfast was amazing, and the snack bar they set up at night was a…"
December 2014,Wonderful intimate atmosphere,"This hotel is a special place ,the staff are particularly attentive and personal without being intrusive highly recommended for guests who prefer the  small and intimate atmosphere which is created superbly by all the staff at the 41"
December 2014,The best hotel at which I've had the pleasure of staying,"Having only ever heard the reviews & stories of this hotel, and fortunately being a business traveller to London's 5 star accommodations, I was prepared for this to be another lovely boutique hotel. What I was not prepared for however, was the absolute joyous and uninhibited luxury of Hotel 41.  Even before we entered the secluded & regal lobby, the feel and impression of the building is clearly indicative of the luxury within. met by the most attentive & pleasant young lady, Roberta was welcoming, personable, and interested- immediately introduced us to the hotel. From the check in- at what can only be likened to a fine private club- through to our service at the lounge, the staff at Hotel 41 are by far the most courteous individuals I have had the pleasure of being around.  As…"
November 2014,Outstanding, my self and my husband stayed here to celebrate my 40th birthday. From the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out we were treated like royalty .5stars all the way I'd give more if I could loved every minute of it 😍 hope we have the pleasure of staying again.
October 2014,"Amazing, just amazing","Myself and my husband treated ourselves to a 2 night stay for our 10th wedding anniversary, and to say it was amazing would be an understatement. From the moment we arrived, the staff did everything they could to make our weekend as special as possible. The hotel itself is incredible, pure luxury, from having your bags taken at the lobby, to champagne to sip on at check in, fabulous food, and the lounge with its ""pantry"", a never-ending supply of tasty nibbles perfect after a day around London, or indeed, a night out around London."
December 2014,Fantastic stay at this fabulous hotel,"My wife and I just spent three nights at 41 and can't say enough good things about the hotel and the staff.  From the moment we arrived to the when we got in the taxi to leave, every interaction with the staff was incredibly positive, helpful, and courteous.  Their genuine desire to assist their guests is apparent - from making dinner reservations, booking tours, and helping with directions they are there to help.  The hotel itself was immaculate and every detail done to great luxury.  We will absolutely go back to 41 when we return to London and can't recommend this hotel, and it's fabulous staff, highly enough. Stay there - you will not be disappointed."
December 2014,Absolutely Outstanding,"My partner and I had the pleasure of staying at 41 for a two-night break from 5th-7th December.  From the moment we stepped away from the madness and noise of London into the beautiful black and white foyer, we were treated like royalty.  We were welcomed by Malcolm, the manager and his team; we were relieved of our luggage and taken up in the lift to the Executive Lounge to check in.  What a check-in!  A trolley bearing a selection of bottles of champagne was presented to us by Norbert and we were invited to choose.  Having completed all the formalities, it was suggested we sit in the lounge and finish our champers before going up to our room, Norbert kindly having served us delicious canapes and nibbles to soak up the bubbles.  I had booked us the 'Night To Remember' package…"
December 2014,"Special, secret place","Our second visit to 41 and just love this little gem. Really don't want to share it with anyone else however it's too good not to recommend. Our beautiful cosy room was perfect, apart from external building noise but after mentioning this to the lovely in house team we were soon moved - and what a move. They very kindly put us in the amazing Balmoral Suite which was so much more than we could have wished for. We spent our evening in the relaxing, stylish lounge having cocktails and ""plundering the pantry"".  Tasty delicacies, both savoury and sweet. Such a treat and we are already saving up for our next visit. "
November 2014,WOW!,"We stayed at Hotel 41 back in November for my boyfriends 21st birthday. After looking on trip advisor and noticing Hotel 41 was rated #1 and reading through the amazing reviews I thought it were only right I booked to stay there for the occasion.  Hotel 41 contacted me before our stay with a preference form to see if we had any special requirements for example what kind of pillows we liked, in house massages, if we would like a bike machine in our room etc. Hotel 41 were very happy to accept special requests, they also asked if the stay was for a special occasion.   When I first booked the hotel I did think to myself it was a little pricey, after visiting all I can say it was worth every penny, every single penny.  I did not want to leave, even though it was only 1 nights stay…"
November 2014,Great stay,"We just returned from 3 night stay at 41 hotel, the other reviews really cover it well. The staff were so helpful and accommodating.  We arrived early in the morning from an overnight flight from the states, and since our room wasn't ready, they offered us a courtesy room to use until our room was ready. The snacks available throughout the day were great and the room was spacious and very comfortable. On top of all that, location is perfect, near Victoria tube station and Gatwick Express train.  41 has spoiled us, we won't be able to stay anywhere else in London. "
November 2014,Romance at the 41,"We stayed in the 41 in November nearly 9 years after our first holiday there and so the hotel has very fond memories for us. I wanted to propose to my partner and with the help and advice from Monika it was a truly special occasion. Monika and her team arranged rose petals on our bed saying ""WILL YOU MARRY ME"", there were more petals in the bathroom, a hot bubble bath and our favourite song playing when we walked into the room after being out for the afternoon. She even stayed on after her long shift finished to ensure it all went okay.  My fiancee was surprised, delighted, emotional and thankfully said yes.  I cannot add much to the other positive reviews on how wonderfully friendly and welcoming and helpful the staff are. Very comfortable beds, great breakfasts that you linger…"
October 2014,Very good four star hotel,"This is an old Victorian railway hotel with a modern extension at the back. The rooms are all clean and tidy and you have a choice of modern or older rooms but even the old ones have been restored very well. Rooms at the front tend to be a little noisy but not too bad. The food is very good and you can have bar snacks, many of which are like meals or eat more formally. The key to this hotel's success is the quality of the staff from the General Manager right the way through to trainees. The hotel is also trendy with lots of different artefacts all over like an old phone box, giant chair and interesting paintings and sculptures etc."
November 2014,Wonderful Stay at Hotel 41!,"My husband and I just returned from a perfect stay at Hotel 41. Our purpose for traveling was to celebrate my husband's birthday.  Thank you Mr Hendry and your wonderful staff for making this a vacation to remember. The hotel arranged theater tickets (great seats) and a wonderful birthday dinner. The room was very nice, very well appointed. The complimentary food in the lounge (including ice cream and chocolates) was excellent, the full English breakfast was delicious and the dinner at Bbar  restaurant (affiliated with the hotel) was perfect. Without hesitation I would recommend this hotel to anyone who desires a high end hotel experience in London. Once again, I can't thank the hotel staff enough for their kindnesses during our stay. This is really a special hotel."
November 2014,First class treatment,"We stayed at this gem of a hotel to celebrate our 20th anniversary. and were made to feel special throughout our two night stay. Everything was perfect from the warm & friendly greeting ( with complimentary glasses of champagne) when we booked in to the care that was taken in wrapping up my anniversary bouquet of flowers at the end of our stay. We were given a free upgrade to a charming split level suite which consisted of a small lounge on the ground floor and a bathroom and bedroom on the upper floor. The bed was huge and really comfortable with the largest softest feather pillows that I have ever slept on. The staff were attentive and friendly without being intrusive, nothing was too much trouble for them. Food was wonderful, we had full English breakfast & a champagne…"
November 2014,Can I rate 6 dots?,"Stayed here five nights while attending a conference and conducting business so needed the place to be home-away-from-home and the staff to be very on top of things. In these respects as well as all the usual categories for a boutique hotel, the 41 exceeded my already high (#1 Tripadvisor London Hotel!?) expectations. It's an exclusive hotel-in-a-hotel, on the fifth floor of the Rubens, and feels like a swanky private club. The lounge is beautiful and the goodies - ""plunder the pantry"" after-hours complimentary buffet, for example - generous and thoughtful. I peeked in a couple of rooms when making plans to return in two weeks. I had a gorgeous King room but even the little double room was beautiful and fully appointed. The bathrooms are pristine and roomy. The staff is…"
November 2014,A Special Experience at 41,"I just read rare negative review of this hotel and felt compelled to write my first ever review of anything on line.  I am typing this as my wife and I are about to check out of our first time stay at the 41.  We were here for 3 nights.  We decided to stay here based on the #1 rating Trip Advisor reviewers have bestowed on this establishment, despite being skeptical about the relatively high price.    Let me say this was a special place, due to the special team in contact with their guests.  We would wholeheartedly recommend 41 to anyone.  A few points we want to make.  First, is it expensive (north of $500/night), yes. But you get what you pay for and there is actually value and special touches we rarely see in hotels we have stayed at around the world.  A full breakfast was…"
November 2014,Best hotel ever,"Stayed to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday  Booked this hotel because of the amazing reviews on trip advisor and would wholeheartedly agree with everyone's positive comments This is a real gem of a hotel in the heart of London. The hotel has so many little touches that makes your stay so special. The staff are wonderful, making sure that every element of your stay is perfect. The food was fantastic - enjoyed a delicious 3 course meal in the excutive lounge and one of the best English breakfasts I have ever  tasted. Thank you hotel 41 ."
October 2014,Lovely stay at 41,"My partner and I recently stayed five nights at Hotel 41 and had a perfectly lovely stay. As travelers who love a boutique, intimate hotel experience this was a perfect choice. Situated in what we considered a good location - near Buckingham Palace and the Victoria station - this hotel, as other travelers have said, feels like an exclusive club. On arrival your bags are left to be delivered to your room while you're offered a beverage and snack prior to a quick and painless check-in.The hotel has a modest entrance, always manned by a personable staff member, with a lift that leads you through a maze of corridors to the Executive Lounge. The lounge is the hub of the hotel and a great space for a snack, evening beverage or game of cards. The evening snacks are a welcome-back treat…"
November 2014,cramped and overrated,this hotel has tiny rooms hard beds and staff that watch you all the time. At the prices charged we expected a lot more. It was like staying in an overstuffed guest house overseen by a landlady with a beagle eye. When asked for directions staff had to look up the nearest theatre (5 mins ) walk away on the computer and then sent us to a road which has been closed for some time now with building works.
October 2014,Wonderfull experience,"We stayed one night for my wife's Birthday. This hotel and its staff are brilliant, I was expecting a lot having read the reviews on here but our stay surpassed my expectations. If you are comparing hotels in London in this price bucket;stop comparing and just book hotel 41."
October 2014,A gem in the heart of London,What a remarkable hotel.  From the minute we arrived it felt like home.  On arrival we were greeted at the door with a glass of sherry and from that moment on we were totally pampered.  I was a bit nervous about booking a hotel in that price bracket but I was not disappointed and will certainly be staying here next time I visit London.  The beautiful lounge was like being at home curled up with a magazine.  Totally worth the money.
October 2014,A one night stop over for a special event,"I booked 41 after googling ""best hotel in London"" as I had a special occasion in London. The booking process was excellent and the lady on the telephone was very attentive.the location is a 4 minute walk from Victoria station. On arrival the whole experience started to snowball into sensory overload. The staff are fabulous, the facilities excellent and the bedroom... Well, I booked the basic room, I dread to think what the suites will be like. Our room had a mezzanine floor and a swimming pool for a bath, with 3 TVs in the room. The hotel is small , and if there is a con to the pros it will be the cost. However, even though it is not cheap, it is value for money, and that for a 5* is not an easy thing to address. If you can afford to stay at 41 it is a must stay hotel in London.…"
October 2014,Where to begin...........,"Our experience began from the moment we entered the doors to this hidden treasure.  We were taken up to the lounge where we were checked in - with a glass or two of bubbly!  We were then taken to our room - we had been upgraded and my breath was well and truly taken away by this amazing suite.  On entering you arrive at a cosy seating area with an a open fireplace, with stairs leading up to our bedroom - and when we go up to the room - the ceiling blinds were drawn back to reveal the most amazing window - we were in the conservatory suite.  The room was spacious, well decorated and well kept - with a Jacuzzi bath tub and walk in shower.  After dinner, we returned to the hotel and had a nightcap in the lounge then on returning to our room we were met by rose petals leading from…"
October 2014,The best,"This really is your home from home this is the second time my partner and I have stayed the experience just gets better and better from the minute you arrive at check in you are made to feel at Home immediately and greeted by a genuine friendly face . Hotel 41 has it all , frendly and helpful staff great location ,palatial rooms and the executive lounge is the best place to relax and enjoy the treats available all day from the pantry in front of the open fire . We enjoyed our visit so much we have booked again for December , looking forward to seeing the Christmas tree"
January 2014,Fantastic ,There is a reason this is one of the top hotels in Europe.  You'll not find better service or such a sense of exclusivity and privacy anywhere else.  The private library lounge is often a private retreat leaving you feeling as if you are living the life of a billionaire.    Many rooms have fireplaces and are a particular treat in cold winter months.  Worth the upgrade from the Rubens when you are able.  
September 2014,HOTEL 41 - EXCEPTIONAL!,"We have just returned to New Zealand from another wonderful three night stay at Hotel 41.  Hotel 41 you didn't disappoint - exceptional service, luxurious rooms and above all wonderful, friendly staff.  Our special thanks must go to Monika whom I dealt with after staying two years ago - it was lovely to be greeted by a familiar face and we cannot thank her enough for making our stay special with our daughter Natasha.   Hotel 41 delivers on all counts - great proximity, great staff, fabulous food and above all it is very central to all activities.  Victoria Station is close as is Buckingham Palace and the parks.  Breakfasts are wonderful and the chef is to be congratulated for delivering such good food and snacks every day.  It was always such a lovely treat coming back to Hotel…"
September 2014,Even better service the second time around,"We stayed at 41 in the fall of 2013 en route to Nice France for the winter and promised ourselves that every time we pass through London we will always stay at this hotel. In our previous review we commented on the personal service which was the best we have ever experienced in a hotel. In September 2014 on a return trip from the Baltic to Canada, we once again had the pleasure of spending wonderful nights at 41. How was the service better this time? As we walked into the reception area, we met Monika, who had looked after us so well in 2013. She remembered us instantly by name. Everything else for the next three days was as great as the last time. So guess what? On our next trip to London, we will be back at 41."
October 2014,I can think of 41 reasons why we must return!,"This small hotel is a unique experience in a city known for superb hotels. Situated between Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station it's a haven of peace and luxury in London. There is always one person, sometimes two, sitting inside the front door who welcome you as if you were an old friend.You are escorted up a hall to a lift which takes you to the 5th floor where all the rooms are situated. You are ushered into the lounge a very bright and comforting room on two levels, more staff are waiting and after greetings ""would you like a glass of champagne""? They  explain that this is the main area, breakfast is served here, other meals too. The bar in the corner is well stocked with a buffet opposite with canapes provided from 6pm to go with the champagne. From 8pm there will be…"
September 2014,Almost perfect,"Stayed the weekend to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary and had a fantastic time. Champagne on arrival, flowers and a cake in the room with tealights and rose petals; fabulous food available at all times; great breakfasts, well trained staff who know what to do and an upgrade to a junior suite.  The decoration and ambience is pure class and whilst the Executive Lounge feels a little like a gentlemans club, it isn't pompous or intimidating like some quality hotels.   Everything about this hotel makes you feel special.  One criticism only - the bedroom ceiling height. At 6'2"" tall I was just about OK . That did make the bedroom feel just a little cramped but with a huge bed and dark mahogany furniture and a massive TV it did fit a lot in.  It's not cheap - but it's worth…"
September 2014,A Must Stay in London!,"This review is long overdue as we stayed on September 5th for my husband's birthday. I can't stop thinking about our stay and how it was absolute perfection. From being greeted with the champagne trolley to the gorgeous canapés in the evening and then of course the room! Absolutely stunning! I can't even begin to recommend this hotel enough and I've told all of my friends that if they have the opportunity, and a special occasion to celebrate, this is the place to stay if you want a real treat. The staff is superb and really make you feel special. The attention to detail in everything they do is genuine and well thought out. This hotel is faultless and I just can't wait to go back!! Hotel 41 is a real gem in London. It's a special place and will hold a special place in my heart.…"
November 2014,Don't stay anywhere else!,Just returned from a simply marvellous 2 night stay. The previous reviews have said it all. The team are very professional in all that they do and attention to detail is second to none. I highly recommend this hotel as a place to stay in London don't stay anywhere else. We will most definitely be returning for a longer stay next time.
November 2014,"Superb Hotel, highly recommend","We wanted somewhere nice to stay and this hotel fitted our expectations. It's not often I give 5 marks, but this hotel was worth it. The service and the attention to detail set this hotel apart from others. We only stayed 1 night, but could of stayed more. The little extra details and the welcome was great. The only slight criticism was we stayed in 4108, and the creaking footsteps was quite noisy. But apart from that wonderfully loomed after and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again."
November 2014,Treated like royalty,"This hotel is in a great location, 1 block from the underground, very quiet rooms. Booking the room with executive lounge access gave us a place to unwind after a busy day of sightseeing. We had no desire to leave as the staff was extremely attentive and the wine/ snacks were excellent. The food from the menu if ordering was also delicious! We have to thank all the staff for the best stay we have had in any boutique hotel that we have stayed at. The stay made our trip to London extremely enjoyable and we will definitely try and get back as soon as we are able."
November 2014,Amazing stay,"Fabulous hotel - nothing bad to say at all.  I only booked Hotel 41 in the first place because it was rated #1 hotel in London on Trip Advisor and it didn't disappoint in any way.  Special mention should go to Monika and Flo who welcomed us with champagne and saw us off at the end of the stay with a glass of champagne - such a lovely touch.    All the staff went out of their way to make sure there was nothing lacking, incredibly attentive, even down to the way they bagged up a selection of sweets for us to take home to our children.  The room was beautiful and as it was our anniversary they scattered rose petals all over the floor while we were out having dinner.  We will not be staying anywhere else on future trips to London and can't wait to return asap."
November 2014,Perfect,"Stayed at Hotel 41 for two nights. All I can say is that I will never stay in another hotel when I am in London this is the best hotel ever. The staff,  the room,  the breakfast well everything is just perfect."
August 2014,Very impressed,Loved this place good quality great prices and food locket staff was so impressed will be returning soon very impressed    Good location also and the bathroom in my room was amazing loads of hot water breakfast good quality
November 2014,A hidden gem of a hotel!,"Thanks  to TripAdvisor for revealing this hidden gem of a hotel to us! I was looking for a great hotel in London where I could really pamper my wife on her anniversary, and as always I checked TripAdvisor. Hotel 41 was highly recommended, so I went for that. What  a choice it was! Everything was impeccable,from location to service and amenities. We got an upgrade to a Junior Suite, which was amazing! It is clearly that the owners and management has a clear idea and philosophy of design, personal service and discrete attendance! This is the best stay we ever had in a hotel, and we would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a special treat when celebrating anniversaries or similar. Thanks again to all of the wonderful personnel at 41!"
November 2014,Fabulous new find! ,"We were guests at the Hotel this past weekend and truly felt like guests in someone's beautiful English manor. The staff, accommodations, lounge and food/drinks were top notch! We are seasoned luxury travelers and really enjoyed this small luxury find in London. The jr suite has plenty of space, great king size bed, nice sized bathroom. Only minor complaint was that our jr suite bathroom had a very tiny shower stall. My husband could not use the rainhead  nozzle in the ceiling as it was too close to his head and he couldn't open his arms in the stall. He resorted to using the hand held sprayer. Very tiny shower! The access to the executive lounge with unlimited snacks and some drinks was a nice touch. The morning breakfast was also nice each day.  All the staff was professional…"
November 2014,"Welcome back, welcome home!","There are plenty of reviews here that cover the great location, the beautiful rooms, the homely but luxurious club feel to the whole place and the delicious snacks available all day. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary so this was a very special occasion.  For me, 41 excels in the hospitality offered by everyone at the hotel. You can get great service in plenty of 5 star hotels in London but at 41 you get great hospitality.   Hospitality is not just about meeting your needs but about how everyone makes you feel. 41 makes you feel right at home. Coming back late from the theatre I removed my boots and socks and put on the slippers provided before wandering into the lounge for drinks and nibbles. Marius made the Martini while we sat and watched the American football with…"
November 2014,Fabulous boutique hotel - still great on 3rd visit,"We had the oppotunity to stay here again recently and it is still as fabulous as the prior visits.  The staff is outstanding and truly care about your needs and what would make the visit perfect.   We had room 4129 which was larger than ones from our prior visit - it was very comfortable with separate shower and tub.  It also was laid out with essentially two rooms plus bath - with plenty of space for luggage as well as relaxing on the couch.   The food (breakfast, tea, drinks) were all great.  We love the ability to grab a snack from the pantry and sit by the fireplace.  The location is easy for walking to various areas and they are always ready to assist with any other transportation.  There are a lot of great places to stay in London, but we've never seen one where EVERY…"
October 2014,Dream like state...,"Hotel 41 greeted me with such wonderful service.  The people are very nice and friendly and the dining experience is excellent.  The hotel is very intimate, personal, and charming.  I felt like I was at home in a very exclusive hotel.  The hotel is not open to the general public, so my privacy was maintained.  For a large city, I expected to hear much noise from the road while sleeping.  However, the room I had (#4114) was very quiet.  Dickson waited on me and was very friendly and personable.  The rest of the hotel staff treated me very nicely.  I only have good things to say about this Hotel.  The location is awesome.  It is very near to Victoria Station (to your left as you walk out the hotel) as well as Buckingham Palace (to your right as you exit the hotel).  I felt like I…"
November 2014,Special weeekend,Highly recommend.  The service is the best that I have ever had in London.  Nothing is too much trouble.  Rooms are of an exceptionally high standard.  Cannot fault it a all.  We stayed on a Friday evening and went out for the day Saturday.  The hotel looked after our bags all day and invited us back in the afternoon for a glass of champagne and some food!   Amazing! 
October 2014,Pretty perfect!,"The hotel was perfect for a 3 night stay: comfortable bed, taxis out front, central location, fabulous food for meals or snacks, gorgeous sitting room. But the best part was the young, enthusiastic staff  always available to help. Can't think of anything I'd change!"
October 2014,Speechless. Fantastic hotel. ,"Up until our stay here I often stayed at The Landmark and 51 Buckingham Gate which I would say are some of the best hotels in London.   However having Stayed here I have changed my mind. We had an utterly perfect stay, which went above and beyond our expectations.   The attention to detail in all aspects of the hotel are mind blowing. If your thinking of a special night away I couldn't recommend it more.   We will without doubt be returning and it's certainly the best hotel I've ever stayed in to date.   "
October 2014,Perfect,"My wife and I stayed on 29th October. A great experience from start to end. The staff were brilliant, they listen and care in a way that makes you feel that they really want to look after you - not because they are told to, but because they want to. The decor is great and the rooms perfect, clean with comfortable beds and crisp fresh sheets that just make you want to stay in bed!  I have already booked for my next visit..."
October 2014,Faultless,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 a few weeks ago and from the moment of arrival (with my favourite champagne) to departure, the accommodation, staff and level of service were faultless.  Having retired from a career in hospitality I thought I knew a thing or two about customer care and well trained staff but the team at 41 surpassed all my expectations.    Our room was extremely comfortable and the rose petal turndown with candles and light music was an unexpected delight. Snacks were available all day with the mini shepherd's pies served during Plunder the Party time - my husband's favourite.  We stayed at the Ritz last year as this was always one of my ambitions. And, although it was very nice,  I have to say Hotel 41 has definitely come out on top!  Looking forward to…"
October 2014,A magical experience,"My wife and I stayed as a surprise 50th birthday celebration at what is truly a 5-star boutique hotel. The staff was fantastic. They provided personal, friendly, exceptional service from before we arrived until after we left. That alone would have been worth the stay. Add to it 4 nights in the Conservatory Suite with its all glass ceiling and lots of extras the hotel provides, such as an excellent breakfast, ""raid the pantry"" throughout the day (and night), a room to take a nap and freshen up in while waiting for your room to be readied, and you have what is a magical experience. Hotel 41 is one of the best kept secrets in London. We look forward to our next visit."
October 2014,What a little gem in the big city,"We have stayed here 3 times now, twice this week and I have to say it is a little gem in all the hustle and bustle of London. The hotel, the rooms, the service and the food and also the staff are fantastic. From the moment you walk in and receive your glass of champagne to the check in process and then when you come back at the end of the evening you can chill out by the fire and have cheese and biscuits and wine. All the nibbles are included in the price too. When we got back saturday evening our room was covered in petals and everywhere was lit up with candles. Beautiful I absolutely love it. Anyone looking at this hotel will certainly not be disappointed."
October 2014,Excellent as always,"Our second stay at this Hotel, we were there in 2013 and it was wonderful to come “home”. We were greeted as old friends and it was wonderful to see Lauren, Monika and Magdelena again and also to meet Malcolm the General Manager. As always it’s a lovely way to check in with a glass of “Verve” and have a catch up on what everyone has been doing in the last year.  This time we were in Room 4119 which had a little downstairs lounge area (TV, Fire, fridge) and then you go upstairs to the bedroom and bathroom.   Good sized bathroom with quality amenities and whilst the shower was a little small in size everything else about the property outweighs this.   Whilst the room was smaller than the ones we had stayed in in 2013 we were only here for a couple of days as part of our 30th…"
June 2014,Swanky excellence!,Our stay was perfect in every sense.  The staff at Hotel 41 was incredibly accommodating and fantastic to work with through the whole process from booking inquiries until after our return home.  We had a small billing inconsistency upon our return home and the staff quickly rectified the situation.  We were well tended to while there and our accommodations were perfect and comfortable.  Hotel 41 is in a fantastic location!  So glad that we chose to stay here!  Hope to return someday!  
December 2014,A haven of excellency,"A haven of peace, comfort, effortless quality & chic, nothing's too little, too small to make you feel at home, from the moment you arrive till the moment you leave.  And this in the heart of London. Could recommend the place to everybody !!! Filip"
November 2014,Hard to believe,"My wife stayed at 41 two years ago and came home raving about the place, so when we went back to London last week we stayed there again.  It was my first time and I must say that it was the most pleasant hotel stay that I have ever had.  The staff are unbelievably focused on making everything you might desire come to be. Polite, helpful, attentive are simple words but its all real at 41. The Executive Lounge is another delight.  I can't imagine returning to London unless we stay at Hotel 41."
July 2014,This is Royal Treatment,"From Check-in to Check-out, the quality of pampering here is unsurpassed, anywhere. The staff took care of every detail, right down t o remembering our first names. The rooms were decorated with the latest fashions, with heated floors and towel racks to boot! Being situated within walking distance of all the attractions, this is the place to stay. The price is of a 5 diamond hotel, but well worth the stay. Thank you Hotel 41......"
November 2014,Magnificent,"I want to echo previous comments. This place cannot be faulted. Treated perfectly from the moment you book. Nothing has been overlooked, they must have taken experience from many other places and just tweeked them to make them even better. A million small things that make the whole stay perfect. We will return."
November 2014,We just keep coming back!,"Usually I see a review like this and think, oh dear, they have too much time on their hands!! but I just wanted to do this wonderful hotel justice.  This was our 3rd year in a row at Hotel 41 and this year we were lucky enough to stay in a suite which was just beautiful. Incredibly luxurious but still very cosy and homely at the same time.   From the moment you step through the doors at this hotel you are made to feel like royalty.  We were welcomed back to the hotel like old friends and as we sat down by the fire with a glass of champagne it felt like we had never been away.    This time we had the afternoon tea accompanied by champagne which was lovely and when we returned to our room on the Friday night, we had the turn down service which was so romantic.  These are extras…"
November 2014,You will not want to leave!!!,"I knew I had chosen the right hotel even before we arrived when we received a detailed sheet asking us for our preferences for the room - types and number of pillows - humidifiers - yoga mats and DVD! Romantic Turndown, Express Check-In or Out, car transfers or theatre and restaurant bookings and even in-room spa treatments.  Everything about this hotel is geared to ensure that the guest has a wonderful stay - the location is perfect for access to all parts of London yet peaceful at the same time and close to green spaces.  The accommodation is relaxing and very comfortable - bedroom windows that open to provide fresh air - solid doors that close to ensure no noise during the night - proper hair dryers in the room - with long cables so no struggling to reach a mirror - lots of…"
November 2014,5 and a half star !,Spent three nights here recently. This is a classic boutique hotel - with exceptional staff.  From the moment you walk into the tiny but lovely (Harry Potter) reception - it is as if you are not in London. The hotel is very quiet despite being in a bustling area and next to a building site.  It is old English style - maybe not to everyone's taste - but certainly to ours. The food is very good - but it is the attention to detail and the exceptional staff that makes this a wondrous place. Very close to Victoria Station - so convenient to get everywhere.  Special mention to Magdelana for historic service.   Cannot wait to return.
October 2014,Absolutley superb hotel!,"This is one the best hotels I have been too! I love the design,  the layout and everything! Really great service and wish I could stay there longer! I would definitely visit again if I come back again on a visit!"
November 2014,Excellent!,"Our fifth visit this November and wonderful in every way. Location good, attention to detail eg without me asking they put a hot water bottle in bed. The staff are superb make it the best we have stayed in London, with their professional but friendly service. We're already booked for the next visit."
November 2014,The best so far,"Simply amazing, a real gem, from the minute you arrive you know its going to be special, we were greeted like old friends & offered a glass of champagne whilst we checked in, nothing was to much trouble, the staff were superb, really was a fantastic experience. Would we stay again? You bet."
November 2013,Luxury for those bored of the large london hotels,"This hotel is very small and feels quite exclusive - its rather different from the larger london hotels  The style of the rooms make you feel a bit like you are staying in a converted part of someone's home - like a luxury bed and breakfast.  They are not the standard size and shape seen in other hotels, but have all  luxury amenities and service of a five star hotel. So this place is great if you are bored of the standard format hotels  If you want intimacy and privacy this is a good place to stay.  If you want spend time in large grand foyers and dinning rooms maybe not..... However, you are more likely to get to know your fellow guests in this sort of hotel. The reception area lounge is the only public area and is cosy.   We stayed in an interesting room.  A small dinning…"
September 2014,A special place,"My husband surprised me with a stay for my birthday. This is a hotel that makes you feel special from the moment you are greeted with a glass of champagne. The staff certainly know how to look after you and nothing is too much trouble, our room was lovely and luxurious and the only problem was not being able to stay longer."
September 2014,perfect,We stayed at this hotel as a treat when we came to London for the great British Pub awards. The Staff and management were faultless as was the food. we would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. The late night buffet is inspired and very welcome after a long night out
June 2014,Birthday delight,"My husband and I stayed for his birthday and it was fantastic. The staff were excellent, the rooms divine, the food at the attached restuarant was bliss, we even bought an umbrella it was that good!!! Highly recommended for a romantic get away, being in the city its the one place that is quiet in London and we loved it."
September 2014,Indulgence at its finest,Hotel 41 is a pricey hotel so staying here really was a treat for my boyfriend and me. Having said that it was worth EVERY penny. Talk about being pampered. My boyfriend described Hotel 41 as a hotel from a movie due to the level of customer service all staff members exhibited at all times. The all-day rotating snack bar is a nice touch and the lounge has a very comfortable atmosphere. It is true that the rooms (or at least the one I stayed in) are a little on the small side but the experience of staying here overcomes any small inconvenience this may cause. Would definitely stay here again the next time we’re in London.
September 2014,Number one Hotel in London on tripadvisor ?,"Normally when in London I stay at the Savoy or Claridges but I also rate highly No1.Aldwych, The Grosvenor, The Four Seasons at Canary Wharf and the May Fair.I have always been curious however as to how 41 gets to rank as the best hotel in London on tripadvisor .I therefore decided last week to stay there .I was not disappointed.The Hotel is exceptionally good, the reviews are accurate and it deserves its ranking.The staff are indeed as good as any I have come across worldwide not so much for their supreme competence but more for the relaxed way they undertake their duties in a way that leaves you with the distinct impression that enjoy what they do and take enormous pride in maximising your enjoyment.Red Carnation Group Hotels continue to impress."
September 2014,Superb!!!!,"Before I even try to describe how ""Superb"" the 41 is I want to say that my wife and I have never had a more enjoyable stay at a hotel than we had at Hotel 41!  That says a lot as we have traveled much over our life together.  Have you ever teared up when you had to depart from a hotel?  My wife could not hold back the tears when we said goodbye to the best hotel staff we have ever had the opportunity to be so close to.  Lauren, Marlen, Monica, Piero, Johann and all the other staff became our family away from home.  They don't allow any small detail to be missed and do it with a warm smile and a caring attitude.  Here is a great example.  We went out to the show ""Wicked"" at the Apollo Theatre close by to the hotel.  When we returned home from the show and entered our room there…"
September 2014,One Word,"If I was allowed to write one word, it would be ""Amazing"".  From the minute that you arrive in this hotel, you will feel, completely enveloped in the quality and service.  The staff are polite without being over deferential.  Enjoy....I did!"
September 2014,A wonderful experience.,"We chose Hotel 41 because of its Trip Advisor ranking and reviews and we were certainly not disappointed. This is the perfect hotel for those who desire perfection and warmth in service and accommodations. It's location around the corner from Victoria Station and across from Buckingham Palace is great as we we enjoyed walks through Green Park everyday there. The staff is the friendliest, most conscientious and helpful of any I have experienced sans the arrogance that is often displayed. Our two story suite a bit ""tight"", but perfectly quiet and tastefully done as is the entire hotel.  It may not be the place for the bar crowd, gym rats or those looking for the scene, but if you want comfort, impeccable service, location and quiet, this is an experience you might also find…"
June 2014,Wow wee,"did the queen stay here once? Cause it's so fancy I loved it I suggest going here treat your self once in a life time opportunity spend the big money and Stay here's it's amazing and a tv in the bathroom wow love it, cleaners were amazing cleaned so well and dressed nicely too all the staff a big thank you for making my family feel at home"
August 2014,It is definitely worth it's #1 ranking on Trip Advisor,"We just returned from our trip to the UK and Paris and selected Hotel41 based on the reviews on TripAdvisor.  The hotel exceeded our expectations in every way!  Hotel41 is a boutique hotel (28 rooms) and part of the Red Carnation Hotel chain (which we were not familiar with prior to our trip).  The hotel itself is adjacent (part of) Ruben's Hotel at the Palace.  A note to travelers - if you are traveling to the hotel via taxi, tell the driver to take you to Ruben's, none of the taxi drivers we used had heard of Hotel41 by name.  The service is impeccable, and you could not ask for a better location (across the street from Buckingham Palace) - close to Victoria Station for train and tube access.    We have traveled and stayed at many 5 star hotels, Hotel41 is definitely in our…"
March 2014,Amazing hotel,We stayed in this hotel while visiting central London. The hotel was amazing and the staff who was working at the time very friendly. Also its fair to add the rooms were very clean. Good value. Highly recommended.
May 2014,Amazing experience!,"Everything about this hotel is fantastic. The deserts at night are delicious the ice cream fridge is great, definitely take advantage of their pantry. The staff is fabulous!  I hope we can came back!!!"
June 2014,"""Mike & Doree's Home away from home""","The 41,Rubens & B-Bar are a must if you're ever in London. The staff, better yet the ""family"" here are like no other's we've experienced throughout our travels both in the U.S. and Europe. We have visited London 3 times over the last 6 years and have made them ""our personal home away from home."" To say that you feel like family is an under statement, Never before have we left a property knowing the names of most of the staff as well as they knowing our's. We can not thank them enough for their genuine hospitality and friendship, anything you want or need they all are so happy to accommodate. So, to Monika, Magdalena, Lauren, Remus, Stephan, Flo, Dave & Nathan a very heartfelt thank you and we'll see you again soon."
September 2014,A Sanctuary,"The excellent staff make this hotel special, they seem to intuitively recognise what guests need and create a sense that each guest is being treated as an individual. The rooms are well maintained and creatively presented. The central lounge was described as the ‘heart of the hotel’ by the staff and became a relaxing sanctuary for us between shopping and dining excursions"
September 2014,Excellence with a personal touch,"We have visited Hotel 41 on 3 separate occasions and have already booked a fourth visit.  Immediately their attention to detail is what struck us the most:  On our first visit my fiancé waited for me in the executive lounge while I parked the car. As she sat by the fire place just by moving her hand over the fire place where there was a slight draft, a member of staff came over in moments and asked if she would like the fire out on. When I joined her for the complimentary glass of Champagne you receive on arrival, the lady serving me opened a fresh bottle to top up my glass which to my eye was pretty much full! Immediately impressed, we soon realised this would set the tone for this and future visits.  Having asked for extra pillow, larger slippers for my fiancé and the…"
July 2014,Amazing hotel,"This was our first stay at Hotel 41 and will not be our last time. From the receptionist to the managers, everyone is very friendly and they make their best to always make you feel welcome. I hope we can came back"
September 2014,"Like a Private Club with 1st Class, Personable Service!","This was our first trip to London so we spent hours researching hotels since we wanted to get it right.  We did!    First off, the location is great. So close to Buckingham Palace you could join the Queen for breakfast if so invited. She obviously was not aware I was not in town as I did not receive the much anticipated invite. Oh well, her loss. Many fine restaurants and other historical places of interest are within walking distance or a short cab ride away.  The guestrooms: All located on the fifth floor of this boutique hotel. They were quiet, well appointed and afforded a comfortable night's sleep.   The service: This was exceptional. The staff's willingness  to take care of the guest and make them feel welcome is what sets this hotel apart from any I've visited in the…"
August 2014,Felt like heaven!,"This was the first time we have stayed at the 41Hotel but will clearly not going to be the last one. Everything in this Hotel is just made to a maximum level of perfection. From the receptionist to the managers, everyone is very friendly and they make their best to always make you feel welcome. We have stayed at the 41Hotel for a very special occasion, and we could not have asked for me.  Not just the service is 5 starts, but also all the food served in the morning on in the evening. Just perfect! Highly recommended! A very close peek on what heaven might feel like :)"
September 2014,A Special Hotel With Outstanding Service,This was our first stay at Hotel 41 and will not be our last time.  Our stay was just exceptional.  The hotel is located right near Buckingham Palace and relatively closely to two different theaters and lots of other places to visit and also near many restaurants.  The hotel rooms are on one floor with an exceptional executive lounge that serves breakfast in the morning and various other snacks throughout the day and evening hours.  From the moment we entered the main entrance we were taken care of by the exceptional staff who looked after our very need.  Nothing was a problem for them and they were very charming and gracious and they truly know what personal customer service is all about.  Thank you to the entire team at Hotel 41 who took such terrific care of us during our…
September 2014,Best hotel staff I've ever encountered.,"I wasn't crazy about the rooms (personal style) but the staff is absolutely outstanding and you get much more than what you pay for. They have free stuff everywhere in the room and are incredibly accommodating. Even though it's got a classic boutique hotel feel, it is incredibly modern. And best part besides the staff is the free wifi !"
August 2014,Absolutely fantastic!,My first impression the beauty of hotel. the hotel was charming as a perfection and can be complained. staff is very excellent and attentive. Absolutely fantastic!. this was the best hotel in London in my opinion
September 2014,AMAZING!!,"Hotel 41 was fantastic.  The location was convenient to everything, as it is centrally located across the street from Buckingham Palace.  It is also only about 2 blocks from the Victoria tube/train station.  The hotel feels more like a special club!  Every single person that works there is professional, kind, and caring beyond belief.  They truly want you to be as comfortable as possible.  When we first checked in, they showed us to our junior suite, a split level room.  As I had just taken a bad fall, my legs were not happy with any extra stairs.  When I inquired about alternative rooms, they responded immediately by moving us to the Balmoral Suite- a huge hospitality suite- for no additional charge!!  We also appreciated the endless options for food and drink as we were always…"
July 2014,"Whatever, Whenever","Without a doubt, one of the finest hotels in the world. We have stayed in the best Mexico has to offer and all over Europe, and 41 has them all beat. From top to bottom the service was impeccable and intuitive. The property is tiny and intimate, and even though there are other guests it doesn't feel crowded; rather, it feels like home. The staff are well-educated and cheerful. Most have traveled the world and we found them to be a good resource for recommending other far-off places to stay.   The best part: the Whatever, Whenever button on each phone. Just pick up the receiver, hit the button and speak. There is seemingly nothing the staff cannot accommodate. Whatever you want, Whenever you want it - this is the guiding principal and it's utterly impressive to see it in…"
June 2014,Greatest Hotel and Staff in London,"My 14 year old grandson and I have been traveling to London for the past 3 years and we always stay at the 41 Hotel.  All of the staff in this Hotel are wonderful! Customer service is outstanding and the room decors are beautiful. We look forward to returning again in June 2015!  Sincerely,  Jeffrey Shaner Las Vegas, Nevada"
September 2014,Best boutique hotel in London,"My parents visited London recently and we all stayed here, I have to say it was one of the best hotels I've stayed in.  I'm not a jet setter, but I know quality service and performance when I see it.  Great staff, great location, wonderful food. 10 out of 10 for these guys."
September 2014,Impeccable Service,"The staff at this boutique hotel, just near Buckingham Palace, were among the best I have ever had serve me in any hotel, in the world. Nothing was too much trouble and their attention to detail was evident at every turn. If you want to be wowed, try this."
September 2014,Amazing experience,"My partner and I chose the 41 to celebrate a special anniversary and were very pleased with our selection.  The hotel and staff are fantastic. I have traveled extensively in the U.S. And internationally and the 41 is undoubtedly the best hotel I have stayed in.  The excellence of the hotel is due in large part to the staff.  I want to give special mention to the manager, Lauren, as well as Stefanie, Alina, Florent, Marius, Norbert, Paula, Marlen, Juliana, Simone, and Yohan, all of whom were extremely professional, courteous, and genuinely concerned about ensuring that the needs of all guests are met.  The hotel staff truly exemplify the motto ""no request is too large or small"".  In fact, they focus on guest comments and go above and beyond to create a memorable stay.  Not only…"
September 2014,Outstanding service,"We spent one week of our honeymoon with the family at hotel 41. I say family because you literally felt at home. The staff are extremely lovely, helpful and will help you with anything at any time. Such a central location and overlooking the Royal Mews which is awesome. Easy walking distance to the tube and local attractions. Good was superb and for me, the service was top notch. Thank you so very much for a brilliant and comfortable stay. "
August 2014,Our Crown Jewel,"Planning our first trip to London, we were given an extensive list of 5 star hotels. We chose none of them and instead decided to take a chance on TripAdvisor's #1 rated hotel. I think all who have had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 would give it 6 stars.  What a special place to spend our first time in London! From the moment we arrived and were greeted with delicious, flowing champagne, to the moment we left, when we hugged the staff goodbye - it was impeccable hospitality.  Attention to detail is amazing, ""plunder the pantry"" is exactly as it promises and more, and staff goes far beyond what could ever be imagined to make your stay special. This beautiful little gem is a magnificent jewel in the queen's crown and made our visit to London one we will never forget."
July 2014,Best service ever,"We stayed here as a treat as we were competing on the British 10K run, the service and attention to detail from all the team at hotel 41 was amazing, including a glass of champagne on our return from the run, much appreciated, we can't thank them enough. We also can't wait to stay with then again soon."
July 2014,Can I move in......Please,"Don't change a thing, I cannot praise this hotel enough. The staff are amazing, friendly and chatty people. The customer service cannot be faulted as they will literally bend over backwards for their guests. The rooms are well furnished without being cluttered and the attention to detail is impeccable and the fact that they have grey goose vodka in the room mini bar is fantastic. You'll never go hungry with all the little complimentary snacks and ice creams aswell as the afternoon tea with sandwiches, scones and little cakes. When you arrive you will be told about the tradition of drinking a glass of champagne to which we were very pleased about. They have a very good selection of Brut, Vintage and Roses. I went with Gosset Rose which was delicious.  I dont want to leave, myself…"
March 2014,Hotel 41!!,"Hotel 41! What a great hotel in such a perfect location, right in the heart of the city. Its very close to all the major shopping, nightlife and attractions. Very stylish and comfortable space, surprisingly large for downtown london. Superb service and excellent environment. Highly recommended"
August 2013,Very Very Good Service,"My husband fell in love with this hotel. The location is wonderful. The staff are amazing, they even gave me a hot water bottle in the bed to warm it up! They changed rooms to one with a fireplace! Amazing. However, the staff was so attentive, I almost felt uncomfortable."
July 2014,Beat in the whole wide world!!,Hands down this is my favorite hotel in the world. It was the first time I stayed there and it was the last time. The hotel itself is quirky and cool while the staff is nothing short of awesome. My daughter and I were treated like royalty. I think the employees truly enjoy working here because they are so happy and helpful- no task too big for them. It's so very close to Buckingham Palace I thought of waving to the Queen!
July 2014,Superb,"Our second stay at Hotel 41 and pleased to say the standards are as high as ever. The staff make this hotel what it is and their professionalism and friendliness is amazing. One of our party was in a wheelchair and he was well catered for and looked after. Special thanks to stefan and lauren who were attentive, helpful and amusing. Keep up the great work- can't wait to stay again"
July 2014,Just a bowl of cherries,"Many five star hotels have sumptious surroundings, delicious food and drink and exceptional comfort,  Hotel 41 has all of these but also something else that sets it apart - absolutely amazing customer service which is friendly and professional but never snooty.   I stayed here for three nights with my 11 year old daughter in a Junior Suite as a treat for her winning a major golf competition.  We returned to our room on the first evening to find a 'congratulations' cake waiting for her, its fair to say she was delighted at this thoughtful touch.  One afternoon we returned to the hotel and my daughter proceeded to avail herself of the cherries dotted around the complimentary fruit bowl in the street level lobby. The concierge inquired if we would be going to the executive lounge…"
June 2014,"Location and service: ""Brilliant""","There is really not much that I can add to the other rave reviews.  Location: unbeatable – right next to the Queen.   Staff: very professional and personable – with a special mention to Monika and Stefan, who both went the extra mile to make our stay special.   Rooms: not particularly large, but well appointed, comfortable and cozy.  Breakfast: generous – particularly enjoyed the eggs royal!   We went out each evening and sadly never managed to “raid the pantry.”  Which leads to my only quibble: the entrance is locked and left unattended at 11:00PM – perhaps a tad early (especially when the key card doesn’t work), but no big deal.  All in all, an exceptional hotel.  A bit pricey, but one gets what one pays for.  Will definitely return."
July 2014,Loved it!,"We celebrated my wife's birthday here - and I am so pleased with the choice.  A special hotel - boutique style. The rooms are very pleasant, not huge, but knockout when you're trying to impress the missus!  The service was attentive but not overbearing, friendly but respectful - really pleasant. Nothing was too much trouble.  The Executive lounge is done out like a gentlemen's club (well, not having been to one, how I imagine such a club to be). Snacks all day (no charges) and an honesty bar.  The welcome glass of champagne on arrival really got the day off to a super start. And, if it's a romantic weekend, the turndown service was perfect.   During the week there are also business guests apparently, so it is not just couples.  We will be back! Loved it."
May 2014,WOW,I had booked the Rubens for a 50th Birthday treat for my husband. On arrival we were greeted by the duty manager who upgraded us to Hotel 41. What a fantastic surprise. When entering this hotel you are made to feel so very special. Our room was perfect and a welcome Happy Birthday cake from the hotel. We also had afternoon tea which was just perfect. This hotel certainly has the Wow factor and we can honestly say we have never experienced such a high standard of service from any other hotel where  we have stayed in. The staff deserve a massive congratulation's for there excellent customer relations skills. I only hope One day I have the pleasure of returning.
July 2014,Amazing Experience,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel 41 in London England last weekend and were blown away by the service provided by this boutique hotel located close to Buckingham Palace in London.The staff went above and beyond the call of duty and the accommodations were outstanding. We would recommend this gem to anyone looking for a charming getaway in the heart of London. Steve and Ewa from Oakville, Canada"
July 2014,Second visit even better than the first,"My first visit blew me away and this second visit in a year improved on that. The staff manage to combine super-friendliness with great professionalism and customer service. They remembered us AND our TripAdvisor review!  Any room is great and make sure you leave room in your diet for the deli counter in the evening after the theatre - it includes salmon, desserts such as profiteroles, cheeses, cold meats, a mini hot dish etc.  I will always choose this hotel from now on!"
August 2014,Lovely small boutique hotel with the perfect location.,"This 28 room hotel does feel like a private club instead of a hotel. If you like very small hotels  then this is the place for you. As you walk into the front door off the street, you are directed up to an elevator to the executive lounge which is the check out/in area/ breakfast area, etc. A beautiful room for sure. We stayed for one night only as a layover and were in the Monarch Suite, a small 2 room area, and my husband and I both had separate bathrooms and a door bt/ the bedroom and living room. It was perfect for us, I cannot image anymore than 2 people staying in any of their rooms or suites. The location is great. Overall we really liked this hotel, not loved it. My husband summed it up perfectly, and but would go back again, but it was a little claustrophobic for him. …"
August 2014,One of the Best in the World,"There are only two places in the world we have stayed that came close to the service we experienced at Hotel 41. Lauren, Victoria and Steffan (amongst several others I cannot recall) were simply amazing and went WAY above and beyond what we hoped for. Their constant refreshing of snacks and food in the main area (not sure if that is what they call it) was also awesome, they took really, really good care of us and I also appreciate a place that uses brilliant branding. You will find the 41 logo on almost everything in your room which, as a marketer, I thought was cool. We highly recommend this place and it is easy walking distance to Buckingham palace."
August 2014,Amazing,"Everything about this hotel is fantastic. The deserts at night are delicious the ice cream fridge is great, definitely take advantage of their pantry.  The staff is so fabulous, always there but not intrusive and they don't stand around awkwardly waiting for a tip (I hate that). The bed is so soft and comfy, the shower and tubs are also fabulous, best shower head ever. Champagne on arrival with fresh berries waiting in our room and a pillow menu I case you need so something different."
August 2014,"Wonderful stay, lovely staff and very convenient location","We stayed at the Hotel 41 in the Balmoral suite for four nights in August 2014 with our three children and we cannot say enough kind words about the staff who were so gracious and accommodating to us - and especially to our children who are 8, 11 and 13. We travel quite a bit with our children and Hotel 41 was one of our favorites of all time. From giving us bus map apps, to helping us with tour tickets, to ""fixing"" our tv (our own tech deficiencies), to the fresh fruit in the room and delicious snacks in the Executive Suite - the staff was incredible.   We came to the 41 after spending a week in Ireland where we had quite large separate rooms or suites, so all of us were worried that we'd be on top of each other in one suite -- but that was NOT the case at 41! We were so happy…"
August 2014,Another world...,"I booked this hotel at the last minute as I wanted to be close to my first meeting.  After flying in on a late flight from NY I arrived around 11 pm but was greeted by a friendly staff, glass of champagne and buffet of appetizers in the lounge.  The lounge itself is very formal, old world and an experience by itself.  The room was not big but was well appointed and had everything I needed.  I liked the idea of the ""plunder the pantry"" concept but did not stay long enough to take advantage of it.  I was not crazy about the gym access at LA Fitness as the gym was not ideal but clearly better than nothing.  I also did not like all the construction going on close to the hotel but nothing they can do about this.  Overall I was impressed and will consider returning the next time I am…"
July 2014,Best Trip Ever,"We stayed at Hotel 41 in July 2014, after nearly 15 years from our last trip to London. It was amazing. From the effortless check-in, to having them print off my very own Washington Post, to relaxing breakfasts and pantry, our stay was perfect. Great location, top-notch and attentive staff, they made our week memorable. We will definitely stay here again!"
April 2014,No Regrets,"My wife and I stayed here, April of 2014....from the moment you arrive, you can tell this place is different and amazing. The check in was flawless, the rooms beautifully appointed, the parlor filled with complimentary wine/cheese/water/soda/ the reading area was amazing. The staff was very attentive and  always approachable. And the location, not sure if it could be more perfectly placed......Hotel 41 has our highest recommendation. "
April 2014,absolutely delightful experience and service!,"absolutely delightful experience and service! perfect location, service, and staff! I would love to come back to this small, cozy hotel!!  The hotel was very close to buckingham palace which is perfect for sightseers and travellers!"
August 2014,3 days in London - this is the place!,"My husband and I had the chance for a short trip to London without our kids. We had not been to London in nearly 20 years. We wanted to make the most of our three days and nights and the Hotel 41 was the perfect place to do so. The location near Buckingham palace was excellent. It was easy to walk to places such as Westminster Abbey and the London Eye from there, and there was a tube station close by. We also took a few taxis, which the hotel staff hailed for us. The Victoria Palace theater is just around the corner, where we saw the show Billy Elliott. Every morning we had a fantastic English breakfast, and we also had high tea as part of our package, which we thoroughly enjoyed. (It was a much more relaxed and gracious experience than the time we had tea at the Savoy back in…"
July 2014,Nice Hotel,"Such a nice place with nice staff too. Easy to find, great location and would recommend the hotel to anyone. The people who stayed here were friendly too which made it an overall excellent experience."
January 2014,Wonderful hotel,"Hotel 41 was a really amazing experience, and the staff were doing everything possible to make our stay comfortable.  Eg. upon arrival, during check in, we were offered a glass of champagne in front of the fireplace and in the late afternoon, canapés were offered to guests sitting in the central lounge.  The hotel is quite small and very cozy, and the lounge is very relaxing and invites you to sit and chat, read a book etc. while you can help yourself to drinks and small snacks from the bar."
July 2014,Without question the best!!,"I cannot state enough how good this hotel is. The decor is beautiful, the food is amazing but what makes it above any other place I've ever stayed (or probably ever will) at is the staff. They go over and beyond what is the expected level of service and make your stay so good you just don't want to leave. My wife and I spent our last night of our honeymoon here before flying out and we didn't want to venture out of the hotel. I booked the romantic package which is definitely worth it, especially for the perfect night with your partner. At many hotels there are offers of extra this or that and they are overpriced and not worth it. Not here. Virtually any extra we went for was not only fantastic but perfecto worth the money. We cannot thank all the staff enough for the most…"
May 2014,Simply amazing!,"We stayed here for two nights, for our wedding anniversary, and everything was absolutely perfect.    From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty; upon our arrival we were booked into our room with a glass of champagne. The staff were brilliant. Breakfast was wonderful. After arriving back from the theatre, we were greeted with candles and rose petals scattered around our room, music playing and a bottle of champagne.  We have already recommended this hotel to friends of ours. There was nothing about our stay I would change - a truly memorable experience.   Many thanks to all at Hotel 41"
August 2013,By Far Best Hotel we have ever experienced,"Hotel 41 exceeded our expectations from the moment the door opened to the Lobby. They knew who we were before we introduced ourselves. We traveled with our children ages 8,12,and 16 as well as my parents aged 65. The employees went above and beyond to make sure everyones experience there was unforgetable. All the small details were attended to. Unfortunately a main water line was broken down the street while we were there causing the water to be shut down and the hotel staff provided extra bottles of water and whatever else they could to make it bearable in the meantime. And I can honestly say even with that glich (which was beyond their control) we had the most amazing time. Also the location is absolutely fabulous. Walking distance to all the main attractions one would want to…"
July 2014,"First impressions, they still work...","From the moment I was greeted at the lobby with the offer to valet park my car to the moment I departed the hotel, everything and everyone at 41 was a credit to RC Hotels. Quirky, yes, the most luxurious, possibly not, but in terms of the welcome, staffing, comfort, and being made to feel like a privileged individual and not just a number, 41 didn't miss a beat.   Arriving at 8.30am, a complimentary breakfast and a room to change in was offered by Monika and Lauren at reception which got us off to a fabulous start. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff and each of them were extremely polite, very well trained, and were faultless in making our stay as comfortable as possible at all times. The rooms were very comfortable and well sized, whilst the Executive…"
July 2014,the swank without the snoot,"we are the goofy americans people talk about, and still the staff was so uniformly cheerful, polite and friendly that we felt accepted and welcomed. they were more than eager to assist even when i got food poisoning and was a mess. i dealt with probably 10 different employees, and they were all gracious. i will definitely be back :)"
July 2014,awesome sevices,"What a great hotel in such a perfect location, in the heart of the city very close to all the major shopping, nightlife and attractions. Hotel 41 is a hotel within a hotel, its the top floor of another hotel and a very stylish and comfortable space. Surprisingly large for downtoen london and a very solid staff. Loved the hotel and the area"
August 2014,Outstanding service & More...,"Well… Whoever will read this review is lucky. Why lucky? because after you finish, you will definitely reserve this fabulous hotel.  This Boutique hotel  is definitely the best in London. I have stayed in more than 20 different hotels in London and can't compare hotel 41 to others.  Location: Absolutely best possible in London.  Quite area and yet close to most London sites. (Big Ben, London Eye, all the Parks, Piccadilly, Museum and of course Buckingham palace)  Room: Wonderful. Well equipped, clean and shine. The best room in London for 400-450 pounds rate.  Service: OK… This is the best point here… I was always dreamed to get in London Hotels the service I'm getting in Thailand. I always thought it's impossible… Well… I was wrong! The service in Hotel 41 is the best in any…"
August 2014,Superb birthday stay,"Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here.  The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate.  Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel.  The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London."
August 2014,"""The"" Hotel in London","This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne).  We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef.   Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic.  I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you…"
August 2014,Our 25th Wedding Anniversary,"Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne.  Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room.  Inside a congratulations cake & sweets.  We had canapés & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music.  I was very emotional.  Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41.  Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere.  We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave.  Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again.  Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well.  Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful."
August 2014,A 2nd visit within last 3 months,"We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August.  We love this hotel.  The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren.  All of the staff was so friendly and helpful.  All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations.  We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good!  Great canapés at cocktail time in the lounge.  The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city.  Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41."
August 2014,Outstanding boutique hotel,"This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate. Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one.…"
August 2014,5 Star Service!,"We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations.   There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing!  If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place…"
August 2014,Wonderful oasis!!,"My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit."
August 2014,One of the best in London,"I am not easily impressed, however; on this occasion I was. Would like to say that it is an absolutely amazing cave to escape and relax and to enjoy pure luxury.  The best thing about this establishment is their personnel. True professionals in every sense. Fabulous!! Nothing is too much trouble and with a huge smile on their faces.  Most amazing bed in my suite. Like a huge fluffy cloud. Slept like a baby!  Attention to detail is added to absolutely everything.  Truly impressed and will be returning soon.  Great location for exploring if you are visiting London for pleasure rather than business."
August 2014,Fantastic service,From the moment we arrived the service was impeccably efficient and friendly too. The check in was seamless and the choice of arrival drink a lovely touch. The room was very well appointed and decorated with lots of toiletries and towels. There service was very personal and the staff all remembered our names and asked about our theatre trip on our return to the hotel. We loved the plunder the pantry in the evening with the selection of tasty treats. This was in the executive lounge which was a great place to relax any time of day. The breakfast had a great selection of quality items including excellent cooked choices. We have visited four different Red Carnation Hotels. They are all very good. This is the best. 
August 2014,The Perfect Proposal,"What an amazing experience! For months I have looked at different ways to propose in or around London but failed to find something special. I am glad I chose Hotel 41!  Weeks in advance I was given the opportunity to discuss every single detail with the Hotel team. It was planned so perfectly that when I checked-in I thought they had forgotten about what was supposed to happen.  A Proposal in the rooftop of the hotel with a champagne tasting experience and canapes. The actual proposal was made using telescope pointing at an adjacent building with a message: ""Will you marry me?"". Over the course of the evening we had the opportunity to then see the stars and the moon - Pretty romantic and unique! The following day we went for a picnic in St. Jame's Park, which is just a few…"
July 2014,Hotel 41 is way past fantastic!,"Hotel 41 is a super fantastic hotel with super excellent service!  And that's putting it lightly!  My husband is a die hard Ritz Carlton fan.  I was surprised when he suggested we stay at a Red Carnation Hotel, but, well, who am I to complain?  Hotel 41 exceeded our expectations and for some reason I felt privileged to stay there.  It's that good.  It's way past excellent!    We were able to compare room decor and size with a similar room at the Grosvenor Hotel where one of our friends was staying.  Our bed was the size of his entire room, no need to discuss the differences any further.    As for service, the attendants are way past exceptional.  For example, we traveled to London to see the Monty Python Stage Show.  Monica found all the reviews and printed them out for us as…"
July 2014,Everyone knows your name but little details need attention,It has been a number of years since my last visit. While the lobby lounge keeps getting better there were a couple of complaints from my recent stay.  Rooms-while well appointed the bathrooms were very small and the showers especially small for a large guest. I stayed in three different rooms and found that when a separate shower area was provided the space was tiny. The Hospitality Suite at 839 pounds was much too expensive while the other rooms at 395 were fairly priced. On two occasions I asked about renting a local cell phone. No one gave me an answer. There is a large staff but I never figured out the distribution of responsibility. Upon checkout they resolved  my misunderstanding about champagne in the lounge being free rather than 16 or 17 pounds per glass. They were…
May 2014,awesome sevices,"The staff was the best!!! They treated us like royalty. They always had smiles on their faces, always ready for recommendations for places to eat, how to get to various locations by taxi or train.We loved London and would come back again and probably stay here just for the service that the staff gives. its simply the best for the  short stay."
April 2014,Excellent English Style,"What a great hotel in such a perfect location, in the heart of the city very close to all the major shopping, nightlife and attractions.  Hotel 41 is a hotel within a hotel, its the top floor of another hotel and a very stylish and comfortable space.  Surprisingly large for downtoen london and a very solid staff.  Loved the hotel and the area"
June 2014,Superb Service,"We have stayed at Hotel 41 a couple of times before and this time was for our honeymoon. From the second you arrive your every need is catered for and you feel truly spoiled. All the staff are polite, friendly, efficient and fantastic at making you feel special.  It's not only the general level of service but the little extra thoughtful things that make it a delight to stay here.  If you want luxury and the very best level of service I have found anywhere then this is the place for you.  Love it. Just wish I could afford to stay there more often!"
June 2014,"""Bea"" looked after!","We spent five nights at 41 in London during Wimbledon.   We travel to London nearly every year, but this was our first stay at this hotel.   In terms of location, when you check in, you will be neighbors with the Queen as Buckingham Palace is around the corner.   As for convenience in getting to anywhere in London, you are a few steps away from Victoria Station that connects to every major line.  This hotel is much like “Platform 9 ¾” in the Harry Potter books – you need to know about it to see it!  A black and white awning branded with the number “41” hides away a small walk in lobby manned with one of the seemingly dozens of welcoming staff who tend to your every need.  During odd hours, the property is accessed with your keycard.  The heart of the hotel is the magnificent…"
May 2014,"Comfortable, cozy and welcoming","41 Hotel is not a super high-end hotel.  It is a welcoming ,warm comfortable little hotel with a meticulous style and staff.  It has a great location just across from the Mews where the carriages for Buckingham Palace are housed, and right up the street from The Palace.  There is some serious construction nearby - the rebuilding of Victoria Station, but it didn't cause any problems for those of us staying at the hotel.  This is an unusual hotel idea - the housing of a small boutique hotel within (on one floor)  a larger hotel.  You enter off the street where there is a desk and attendant who can help with pretty much anything, and go up in the elevator to the hotel.  You are guided through several hallways  past guest rooms to the main reception room where everything happens. …"
June 2014,Perfect luxury in the heart of London,"We have stayed in London on many occasions but after a friend's recommendation we booked Hotel 41 for the last few days of a month's holiday in Europe. We were certainly not disappointed as the quiet ""club"" atmosphere, luxurious rooms and amenities were outstanding. The staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and professionalism - right from the welcome champagne to our evening departure for Heathrow. Arrangements were made on our behalf without hesitation or fuss. The availability of snacks and substantial evening food in the lounge was a bonus. Lauren and the front desk staff were wonderful and we can't wait to visit again!"
June 2014,Conservatory Suite...Perfection!,"I must admit I had never heard of Hotel 41 when my husband told me he had chosen this hotel for our anniversary stay in London.  However I knew it would be good as he had selected it because of its superb Trip Advisor reviews. What we hadn't  anticipate was how fabulous our stay would be!!!  From the moment we arrived through the doors we experienced fantastic customer service.  We were offered champagne by the Stephan the most unique, eccentric, likeable member of the Hotel 41 team.  Such a wonderful way to welcome us.    The decor in the Executive Lounge is sumptuous and luxurious.  The skylight ceiling allowing the afternoon sunshine to flood into the room.   We later returned to this room in the evening to relax and enjoy a complementary drink and ice cream.    When we were…"
September 2013,The Finest Experience in Service and Beautiful Suites,When visiting London Hotel 41 is a must!  Absolute perfection from the minute you enter the front door.  The entire staff was accommodating and genuinely concerned with exceeding all of our expectations.  Our dining experiences for breakfast and dinner were excellent.   During our stay we had a family emergency back in the US and the Executive Lounge was a very comforting environment for us to spend time. The staff was attentive but not intrusive.
August 2014,Beyond the excellent,"Everything is perfect - location, service, staff, food, etc. etc. We just spent four nights at this hotel and definitely would love to come back.  You are treated almost like a member of a royal family at this small hotel. It's very cozy, clean, comfortable and very quiet. Not crowded - just 28 rooms, or so. Short walking distance to all major attractions (not to mention the Royal Mews and Buckingham Palace literally across the street). When I saw it, being listed as #1 at TripAdvisor, I expected it to be good, but it was really exceptional!!"
July 2014,Boutique hotel in a great location,"I jumped a flight from Washington DC to London one evening, leaving behind my husband to tend to the teenagers and decided a two night stay prior to a stay in the English countryside with girlfriends was just what the doctor had ordered. Hotel 41 did not disappoint!  It is a small hotel, tucked away and mere steps from Buckingham Palace, The Royal Mews and Victoria Station. Customer service is paramount and the staff were very attentive to my needs, knowing that I was a female traveling alone - an English Rose escaping her American philandering husband. This is a boutique hotel with high accolades from both TripAdvisor and Conde Nast. Yes, the rooms are small, but every detail and amenity are at your fingertips. And if you are looking for peace and quiet, then the hotel will not…"
August 2014,Fulfilled my expectations.,"Hotel 41 has been ranked as the number 1 hotel in London on TripAdvisor for quite some time. My wife took me there for a birthday surprise on Saturday. I was fully expecting a boutique hotel and quality service, which we received.  The staff are fantastic. The hotel itself has beautiful decor. Yes, it is small, but you only need to do some cursory investigation to realize this. The rooms are quite small, but perfectly functional, the bed is very comfortable.  My criticisms are:  Firstly, and the biggest culprit of all, is the squeaky floorboards. We were in room 4108, I am admittedly a light sleeper and was awoken 3 times by people walking along the corridor, my wife slept fine, she can sleep through almost anything.  The other criticisms are trivial. Such as:  The remote…"
August 2014,Gorgeous little hotel,"This was a short ""honey weekend"" that we had decided to spend in London after our marriage. As others have mentioned, the staff and service are second to none and the hotel in itself is gorgeous. Everyone was more than welcoming and kind, taking any request and delivering outstanding service. We would like to thank everyone for all their attentiveness!  Breakfast is really REALLY yummy, my favourites are definitely the eggs benedict. I would definitely recommend going for the cooked breakfast, as the options are very varied and delicious every time.   Make sure you get to plunder the pantry one evening as there are plenty of lovely treats on offer.  The room was huge, well appointed (we're so sorry we didn't have time to have a proper bath, in the bathtub) and spotlessly clean.…"
August 2014,Expensive little treat,"Myself and my husband just spent the weekend. The food was 5* and we was right in the centre of all the shops and heart of London. Expensive little treat but worth it, Perfect for couples wanting the perfect get away!"
June 2014,Perfection From Check-In to Check-Out,"Hotel 41 made our trip to London an absolutely amazing vacation.  The rooms, location, food, drink,and  quiet elegance were the best I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying.  But the best part of the trip was the staff.  Each and every one of them were top-notch in customer service.  Lauren, who helped me plan the trip from the beginning, set the tone for our expectations.  She also upgraded our room to a beautiful suite. Monika and Stefan gave us some good recommendations for restaurants and sightseeing tours. Remus, Mickesha, Siobhan, Michaela, Juiliana, Norbert, Maruis, Celestin, Florent, Peiro, Tyrone and Simone looked after our every need and want!!!  Mickesha had the kitchen specially make some chicken soup when my daughter wasn't feeling well.  Florent gave me some teas…"
July 2014,Just gets better and better.  Wonderful.,"Hotel 41 is our little expensive treat and once again the hotel did not let us down in any way.  This hotel is quite simply the best place to stay in London if you want quality service which is subtle and unobtrusive.  The room we used this time was perfectly arranged and the little details they provide for a couple seeking a romantic getaway are a very nice touch.  They pick up on your every comment (for example I mentioned the strawberries were excellent at breakfast and what was waiting in our room when we got back that evening, a plate of delicious strawberries).  There are cheaper hotels in London but this hotel is excellent value.  All I can say to the wonderful staff at 41 is keep your standards up and see you in December!"
May 2014,loved it ,Awesome entertainment I thought since I'm American I would be treated differently but they treated me just the same.  I'm totally going to go to London again thanks hotel 41  because I'm living there .  That's my London experience  
July 2014,Just Perfect,Hotel 41 is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The attention to detail and the helpfulness of the staff was excellent. The room was large by London standards and had everything I wanted including a yoga mat. The food was top rate. I will never stay any place else when I am in London.
May 2014,World's Best Hotel Experience!!,"Other hotel operators should take note of how Red Carnation runs 41.  This 5 star hotel is very comfortable and the staff is terrific.  Rooms are nice but what makes this hotel truly special is the Pantry where guests can get self-service tea, snacks, ice cream, etc. any time of day or night.  Makes you feel like home.  At first I thought the pantry would be too expensive for other hotels to adopt, but when I stopped and thought about the actual cost of the snacks we consumed it was not that much money.  Granted to do the Pantry concept the hotel has to give up the idea of selling you a $10 candy bar from the mini-bar but the good vibes more than make up for it.  This hotel is expensive but we couldn't help but feel like we got our money's worth."
September 2014,Amazing trip,The hotel was great and the hotel lactation is really fantastic and the hotel manager was friendly and any kind of information the manager he always give me  the new information and he always help me. I want to the hotel again.
August 2014,The Best Vacation Ever,"We can only give Hotel 41 the very highest rating of excellence. From the moment you arrive and are warmly greeted by the concierge to the gorgeous rooms, easy and friendly checkin, the unbelievable presentation of food and all the amenities, you can not find a better hotel experience. We booked our vacation through Costco Travel and they added to the Hotel 41 experience with their excellent help and prices. Go to London and stay only at Hotel 41."
August 2014,insert superlative here..,"I have stayed in a lot of places and travelled all around the world but there is no doubt in my mind that this is the best hotel experience I have ever had. From the moment I walked in I felt at home, comfortable, cared about.  Hotels often give good service and staff often look like they care about the service they give but in this Hotel they dont have staff, they have hosts.  Hosts do more than staff and care more about how you feel. To be a good host is not a job it is a lifestyle and a vocation, not everyone can do it, not everyone wants to do it but here the people of Hotel 41 do and they do so exceptionally. From the moment we were greeted at the doorway to the moment we popped back in to collect our bags at the end of the visit after a hectic visit of the capital.  I…"
September 2014,Simply the best! Thank you Hotel 41.,"What a fabulous hotel! We stayed here for two nights to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special, being a small hotel the staff know all the guests names and show a genuine interest in your daily plans. We can't single out anyone as they were all excellent!  Our room was beautifully decorated in the hotel's black and white theme, we had an accessible bathroom with bath and separate walk in shower. Lots of fluffy towels and lovely Penhaligan toiletries added to the luxury. There was a lovely cake on a table with 'Happy Anniversary' piped on the plate and the staff also sent us a card.  It's the little touches that make Hotel 41 stand out - we mentioned that we were going to see Billy Elliot and later that day found a signed…"
August 2014,Wow!,"Having stayed here to enjoy a mutual birthday celebration, I am convinced that no other hotel could possibly compare to this amazing find. In all honesty I am very wary of my next stay that is anywhere else but here as there is little hope of this experience being surpassed ever. From the moment the little champagne trolley was wheeled out as part of the very wecloming check in to the thoughtful touches throughout the stay, the service here is truly second to none and the facilities are beyond wow! There is luxury hotels and then there is this property!"
July 2014,Exceptional hotel and staff!,"From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you have a wonderful,experience. Service and staff amazing. Very good location close to dining and shopping. Concierge was one of the best ever and gave great tips on what to do and see."
August 2014,"""Secret hotel"" that you don't want to share with anyone else","What an amazing place! We stayed here for only 3 days but will definitely return in the future. Not a typical 5 star hotel, this place is a definition of a boutique hotel with lots of character and signature English decor. Those people who are looking for a modern hotel with all of the new tech updates should probably stay elsewhere. With only 28 (?) rooms, staff knows theirs guests by name, communicating with concierge is easy and service is great. Having a 24/7 pantry room, free of charge (except for alcohol) was definitely a plus.The room did not have a nice view and typically I would complain about that, but the accommodations made me totally forget about that. The decor, our own living room and an amazing lobby/club room made up for that.   One suggestion for the hotel is…"
April 2014,Yes!,"Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was.  Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful.  Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price.  Will certainly return in near future! "
August 2014,Made very welcome,"The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed."
August 2014,Very special,"This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in . Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything. From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful.  Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat."
June 2014,Perfect for single traveler,"I had one night to spend by myself in London before meeting my group.  This was exactly what I wanted.  There is a pleasant lounge where you can get a simple meal in a club like atmosphere. I do not like going out to dinner alone so this was perfect. I noticed families enjoyed this feature as well.  The staff was amazing.  As soon as I checked in everyone knew my name. I  do not know how they do it. I wanted a luxury stay for the night and this definitely met the desire.  It is within walking distance of the the pageantry of Buckingham Palace, the city's beautiful parks and historic buildings."
May 2014,London's Top Hotel,This is truly the finest hotel in London. This is quite a statement as London has a mulltitude of excellent hotels. I have never received the level of attention  in decades of travel spanning several continents as I encountered at this hotel. The room was also truly beautiful. THis was a trip I will always cherish.
June 2014,JEWELBOX IN THE HEART OF THE CITY,"This was my first visit to HOTEL 41, but it will not be my last. This hotel is truly a little jewelbox in the heart of the City. With just 25 rooms, and as many staff, they offer a very high level of personal attention, and unlike some other high-end facilities, where the staff frequently seem overly-impressed with themselves, the staff at 41 seem to be interested only in giving you the very best experience possible. The room and bath were beautiful and comfortable, the food and wine was delicious (with a never-ending spread of treats in the Lounge, if you leave the facility hungry it certainly isn't their fault!), and the service, as mentioned above, was impeccable."
June 2014,Lived up to the hype,"We had the best family vacation possible thanks to the staff at Hotel 41.  Cannot believe that anyone would consider this less than 5*.  If you want a large reception area, workout room or spa then this is not the place for you.  If you want over the top service, great facilities and a fantastic location then this is a great choice, assuming that you are willing to pay for it (this hotel is not cheap). Many thanks to the hotel staff!  I hope that we can return someday!"
June 2014,Best hotel in the uk!,"Stayed at 41 for the night whilst visiting London and the theatre. The service was unobtrusive and simply amazing. Nothing was too much. Stefan particularly notable as a member of staff that makes you feel special, and at home at the same time. The extras in the lounge are second to none, and the wine cellar perfect. Our room had the comfiest bed and (seriously I'm not exaggerating) the BEST shower I've ever had! It was my birthday too and I was treated to candles, roses and chocolate dipped strawberries. If you only stay in one hotel this year-make it this one. "
June 2014,"Outstanding, private club feeling, just needs a garden","This is an outstanding hotel by every definition.    It's just a few blocks from the palace, but not really in the heart of where you might be going.    Tons of construction, lots of modern sort of building going on, surrounded by easily accessible parks too.   Marks and Spencer a block away for those food callings.  The conservatory suite is very nice, an entire glass roof over the bed, with push button blinds.   As in almost all London hotels, the light switches never make any sense at all.   The staff is beyond belief, instantly knowing you by name, serving you complimentary great food and snacks 24 hours a day, an honesty bar at night.     Unfortunately, there is no ""outside,"" but they are apparently designing a rooftop bar and garden, which will make this the perfect choice…"
June 2014,The best hotel I have stayed in.,"I took my wife down to London for our first wedding anniversary and found this lovely boutique hotel online amongst all the others. And my goodness I am so glad I chose ""41"". As it was our first anniversary, the hotel upgraded us to the master suite - what can I say about the room, stunning!! So comfortable, and well equipped. The staff are so friendly, make you feel right at home, nothing is too much of an issue. Had champagne afternoon tea, fantastic! Breakfast, eggs benedict on the recommendation of Stefan (who i must say is a wonderful host), really delicious. I could go on and on about how fantastic this hotel is, but I would just suggest you try it yourself!! Is there anywhere else I would stay in London for my next visit - NO. Looking forward to next time..."
May 2014,For my taste one of the best Hotels,"Hotel 41 is it - at least if you like personal treatment and british club atmosphere. The rooms are a little bit oldfashioned, however very well maintained and very quiet for a central London hotel. The Hotel is located near Victoria Sation and Buckingham Palace and is therefore an excellent starting point for business or leisure. What Hotel 41 is all about is service. From arrival through departure the extremely friendly and knowledgable staff reads your lips to make your stay a comfortable one. I can very much recommend this hotel."
June 2014,Excellent hotel in London!,"If you like a smaller hotel with personal service and an excellent location, this is the place!  After a long day of travel we were greeted with champagne (which we had to refuse because we were too tired!) and friendly faces.  After a review of the city map and many attractions that we might be interested in we given a tour and then shown to our room.  The rooms are small but the comfort is high!  I have to say that Remus went above and beyond to insure our stay was enjoyable!  We will be back!!"
June 2014,One of the best boutique hotels in London,"I met an exceptionally great group of staff members working for Hotel 41. My stay at the hotel was great and the hotel exceeded all my expectations. I have been to this hotel twice and always feel like home.  The staff was very very helpful at every moment and request. I love the concept of ""Whatever Whenever"". Just having one button makes a lot more sense and makes the guests life a whole lot easier.  I plan to stay here again in future whenever I travel to London. I don't think there is one single staff member that I would like to highlight - I think all of them provided me with an exemplary service and I would like to thank and highlight all of them.  Thanks Hotel 41 for such great experience :)"
May 2014,A truly unique and fabulous experience! ,"I have to say that this hotel has the extras you don't usually get in a 5 star hotel.  First the staff was almost like a very polite and hospital family,  you felt directly at home and treated us like one of their own. Second, the service!!!! Outstanding thought to details and creating an atmosphere where you as guest could feel total relaxation.  Third, the lounge was so delicate and superbly designed that you felt time was slowing down and a feeling of total calmness was surging thru you like a warm bries on a nice summer night.  "
May 2014,"Lovely, luxurious boutique hotel","This hotel is small and very intimate.  The location is perfect, close to everything but quiet as well.  The service is amazing!  The lounge is a very nice feature - we went almost every night before dinner for a relaxing drink and complimentary snacks.  The rooms are a very nice size and the bathroom was lovely too.  We would absolutely return!"
April 2014,Fantastic !,"You know you have entered a quality hotel, no sooner are you through the door and the friendly staff have taken your bags and offered you a glass of champaign or fine wine.  There is only 2 floors to this hotel the entrance and the 5th floor here all the rooms are situated and the dining room stroke bar area, they work on a honesty bar with all named drinks and if you can't find what your looking for the helpful staff will soon find it or mix it up  We only had breakfast here but that was really well made we have already said we will be staying here again in no time At all"
May 2014,Fabulous !,"No review can adequately convey how fabulous this hotel is.  The service is the best.  They have a whatever, whenever button on phone and that sums it up.  Every request we had, they fulfilled.  They can fast track tickets for most anything.  The lounge is very nice with breakfast in a.m. Then snacks all day into evening included.  A honor bar is available ( glass of very good champagne is offered upon arrival complimentary).  We had an executive king room that was a nice size and very comfortable bed.  All of the staff are so friendly and helpful!!  Good location and great wi-fi.  We will return."
May 2014,"Lovely Location, Lovely Staff","The first thing you notice when you enter this cosy English hotel is the courteous and well mannered staff. Everyone laughs and smiles, and just make you happy! They ask if they can help at every point.   Apart from the staff, the great thing about this hotel is their little knick knacks that are laid out throughout the day, to help fill in the little gaps in your stomach. I always looked forward to see what was in store after spending a good day in London.  Their rooms are quite English to begin with. Quite cosy. Their beds are like feathers. I almost always slept within minutes once I was on them.   Overall a lovely stay!"
May 2014,The BEST of many fabulous hotels in London!,"This is only the second time I have felt moved to write a hotel review--this place is THAT special. I have stayed at other excellent luxury hotels in London before but decided on Hotel 41 this time and I was absolutely thrilled!  I was in town alone visiting friends for a few days and the extraordinary staff made me feel completely at home.  I really cannot say enough about them.  Every single person went out of their way to be welcoming and helpful.  I found myself catching up on work each night in the ""lobby"" which is actually more like a library or drawing room in a private home with comfortable chairs and sofas with tables set and food and drink available 'round the clock.  My room was comfortable and impeccably clean.  I can't wait to go back and I am recommending the 41 to…"
May 2014,It's so nice returning to this hotel,"I would like to thank the staff at hotel 41 for making my stay such a pleasant and enjoyable one. I was in London two years ago and visited this hotel for the first time. The staff were so friendly and professional that I decided to return to the hotel again when I was recently in London.  The staff have lost none of their charm and dedication towards the guest. They really are the best staff of any hotel that I have stayed at in the world (and I do not say this lightly).  I would like to thank in particular Monica, Simone, Stefan and David. Nothing is too much trouble for these people and they made my stay another memorable one.  I will happily recommend this hotel to any one who wants not only a stay but an experience in London too. I look forward to returning to the hotel in…"
May 2014,Another Crown Jewel of London,"If you are looking for a small, luxury, boutique hotel, look no further.  While the location, rooms, amenities and food are all outstanding, it is the service that puts the hotel in a class by itself.  This is by far the best service that I ever have been accorded in any European or Asian hotel I have stayed in.  Lauren and Monika and their entire hotel staff were wonderful in assisting with theatre tickets, hard to get dinner reservations and shopping suggestions.   On this trip (April 30-May 4) I was traveling with a friend, but I can't wait to pay a return visit to the hotel with my husband!  Jacqueline P."
May 2014,What a gem!,"We spent 2 days at Hotel 41 after a 15 day transatlantic repositioning cruise on a small cruise ship.  We had been terribly spoiled by the service on the ship, and we were unsure of what Hotel 41 would be like.  The service in the hotel was unbelievably fabulous.  We were pampered from the moment we arrived right through our departure.  The staff was attentive, friendly and very, very professional.  Anything and everything we asked for was seen to with a smile.  The hotel's location is but a few steps from Buckingham Palace and is just a short walk to Westminster Abbey and Parliament.  Other London attractions, if not within walking distance, are easily accessed by nearby public transit.  Our very comfortable room, like the rest of the hotel, was immaculate.  Staying at Hotel 41…"
May 2014,"Truly 5 Star, excellent service","We were warmly greeted by Victoria on our arrival. Lauren gave us the orientation ""tour"". All the rooms are on one floor, as well as the executive lounge where we were seated and offered breakfast while being checked in.  Due to our transatlantic flight we arrived very early but they still allowed us to check in and provided us with a room about 30 min later.  The room may be on the smaller side by American standards but is adequate and well appointed. They put in those extra touches that I love like a bathroom scale! Full length mirror, dimmable lights and reading lights, Penhaligon toiletries  The executive lounge is most likely where u will have breakfast or a late night snack and utilize the concierge to make plans for the day. The room has a great domed skylight which is…"
July 2013,My favorite hotel,"We stayed at the hotel 41 three years ago and we still talk about it as our favorite hotel.  The service, the comfort, the late night snacks and honor bar, the breakfasts, it was all just perfect.  So comfortable - expensive yes, but completely unpretentious. A great family hotel.  If I find myself back in London, I wouldn't hesitate to spend some time at the 41."
June 2014,Special Hotel,"We picked hotel 41 because of the reviews and high scores on trip advisor, so I arrived with high expectations, but was a little wary, as we were getting married in London on the day of our stay But from the moment we checked in, our party of 8 all had our rooms upgraded, to our departure, we were treated like kings. The service is second to none and the hotel is luxury, My expectations were met and so much more, best hotel I have stayed in. I hope to return for future anniversaries, well done hotel 41."
May 2014,Wow as Usual - A London Secret,"I stay at this hotel several times a year when I travel to London for business. The location is very central with easy to access the Underground. The secret of this hotel is the service, I have no idea what the staff to guest ratio is, but there is always someone to help you available at any time of the day. I regularly have business meetings in their boardroom, and they have assisted me getting tickets to plays and London events while I am in town with excellent attention to detail. I like to think of Hotel 41 as my home in London."
May 2014,A wonderful stay in a beautiful hotel,"This was the best and most relaxing stay in London we have ever had, largely due to the nature of the hotel and the staff and management who work there.  The service started before our visit with the manager asking for our personal preferences so that they could be accommodated for our arrival.  We received a complimentary room upgrade overlooking the Royal Mews, with complimentary champagne and personal message from the manager marking our special occasion.  Hotel 41 is a small but beautifully appointed hotel with top quality furnishings and room accessories. Although rooms are not huge the focus is very much on quality and service, rather than size. The theme of quality runs throughout the hotel.  The staff were exemplary and very attentive; some may have seen this as…"
October 2013,Another excellent stay,"Stayed in this hotel with the family, and it really was an excellent stay. The location is excellent, the staff are great, and I liked the decor. They also do a lot of small things that do make you stay that little bit more special."
March 2014,Luxury and Attention,"I have been fortunate enough to have stayed at Hotel 41 a number of times and the service, ambiance and every bit about this Hotel stays constant. It is superb, from the moment you arrive at the reception desk through to the very personal service received from every member of staff throughout your stay. All the staff want you to have a great experience, you can just tell and you do. I love to book in around lunchtime and just sit in the wonderful library surrounding until early evening, nibbling and drinking their brilliant wine, I just don't want to go anywhere, sad but true. I cannot recommend this Hotel more highly, it is just luxury. Additionally you are a few hundred yards walk from Buckingham Palace and the beautiful St. James Park as well as 20 minutes walk to Park Lane…"
May 2014,Never fails to be the best!,"This was our 4th time staying at 41 and at the risk of sounding like a broken record, it was excellent again! Monika and the team looked after us like old friends.  41 is relaxing, peaceful, friendly and quite simply the best place we've found to stay in London.  Hoping to be back again for Christmas!"
May 2014,"The ""E"" in Excellent","My wife and I recently stayed in Hotel 41. The experience was overwhelming.  The staff was professional, attentive, and exacting. Most times when I mentioned an issue or desire in passing it was acted upon immediately. This is a one-of-a-kind gem of a hotel. I would have loved to stay longer, unfortunately, we had to leave. The location is perfect and obscure.  But don't worry. Most taxi drivers in London know its location. Strongly recommend you stay there, even for a short stay, and be prepared to be treated like royalty.  The stay was unforgettable and it is our location of choice on a future visit to London!"
May 2014,Wonderful service!,"I would just like to reiterate what others have said.  I booked this hotel following all the great reviews as a 60th birthday surprise for my mum and I was not disappointed.    After a very early morning flight, my mum and I were greeted very warmly with a glass of Champagne and were told we had been upgraded!  We sat in the Executive lounge, taking in all the beautiful surroundings whilst we waited for Eggs Benedict (which I would strongly recommend)!  You were made to feel very relaxed and encouraged to soak up the atmosphere.   There was food in abundance.  You will never go hungry and Stefan was always on had with a glass of Champagne!    The hotel is ideally situated for Victoria station and Harrods is only a 20 minute walk away. The hotel staff are very knowledgeable, are…"
May 2014,AMAZING!!!,"On arrival to this gem of a hotel, we were upgraded to their beautiful executive suite, we were given a glass of Champagne and shown all the facilities. We were shown to our room and instantly fell in love with it.  The staff were so helpful, they really couldn't do enough for us. We would go back without hesitation and would recommend this wonderful hotel to anyone."
April 2014,Perfect Honeymoon!,"From the moment we arrived to the moment we left everything was perfect. We were a week in London on our honeymoon and all the staff in 41 went out of their way to make it a very special occasion for us. We were treated to drinks and canapes on arrival. We had cake, fruit and water in our room. What surprised us the most though was the attention to detail. The staff noted what we wanted to do for the week and then helped us at every opportunity to make it better.   Our room was beautiful and so comfortable. The bed in particular was so comfy. The room and bathroom were spotless. The food in the hotel was delicious. Raiding the pantry is a must! It was so useful on our return from the theater on one of the nights. The food on offer is varied and always fresh. We were spoiled for…"
May 2014,Great atmosphere ! Spotlessly clean Hotel!,Amazing Staff !! the room was spotlessly clean!!! We had a wonderful stay !!  Location was amazing  next to all the theatres and Victoria station we will be back ! Forgot to say the beds were really comfortable and the design of the rooms we liked very much
May 2014,Excellent hotel and wonderful staff,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 on our first visit to London to celebrate our 32nd wedding anniversary and were greeted at the reception desk with champagne!  And that was just the beginning.  We returned to our room one night to find it filled with candles and rose petals! To say that we were spoiled by the staff would be an understatement.  This is a lovely hotel, so comfy and sparkling clean complete with all the extras, including the lounge with an amazing array of complimentary snacks and drinks.  Once you walk through the door, the feel is as if you are staying at a secret club away from all noise and crowds of the city.  The staff that the hotel has assembled is one of its biggest assets, especially Monika, Lauren and Remus. I would highly recommend this hotel to all!!"
May 2014,Fantastic stay here,"My husband and I have visited hotels all around the world, and this was by far up with the best. The standards were excellent, and the service was really very good.  So many little touches in both the rooms and the hotel.  It is not a hotel that you would stumble on, and its hidden above another hotel called Rubens, but we both like the idea that it is a hidden secret, and keeping its hidden gems away from the masses!  A very very good stay, will be booked when we return in the fall."
January 2014,"Very pleasant, attentive hotel","Just round the corner from Buckingham Palace, this unimaginatively named hotel is pretty plush.  The staff are very attentive; if I'm honest probably a little too much so.  We were in a bit of a rush & it took us the best part of 20 minutes to check in despite us telling them we needed to be quick.  The staff are desperately keen to help.  Room was great, with probably the most little extras I've ever seen in a hotel.  Very comfortable & clean & plenty of character, with a great public lounge which kept on serving us complimentary nibbles until we were too full for dinner.  The place is quite a maze; in terms of location, excellent for all the touristy things.  Would very much recommend, especially if you relish lots of attention from the very well trained staff."
April 2014,A true gem --,"Discreetly located near Parliament and Buckingham Palace, this hotel goes the extra mile in providing professional, friendly service; more than comfortable surroundings. A fully staffed, beautifully appointed lounge is a central place for guests to gather information about the city, relax at nearly any time of the day or night with libations and nibbles provided, or the option of  ordering a meal from their regular menu. I have never stayed anywhere like it in all my travels.  The staff is extraordinary and makes this what it is -- a true gem."
May 2014,Fantastic!,"We just had the most wonderful stay at the Hotel 41.  The service was impecable, very friendly and professional.  Everything was made to make us feel comfortable.  The room was absolutely lovely and we particularily enjoyed having a very nice afternon tea, by the fire place, in the splendid lounge of the Hotel.  Very high standard hotel. No doubt we'll go back!"
May 2014,second time having the pleasure of a stay here,"this is the second time we have stayed at 41 and it was a great stay. the staff is very professional and they went way out of their way to make us comfortable. the ""plunder the pantry"" option is great for late night returns to the hotel- we mad a meal out of it more than once, although the restaurant served food is very good as well. the library are reception is a pleasant place to hang out and have a cocktail. bravo red carnation hotel group! all your staff is to be commended."
May 2013,One of my all time favourites,"Absolutely loved the executive lounge, gorgeous hotel and fantastic location. I would totally recommend it, but if you are looking for a big hotel with loads of room then this isn't for you. It's a small yet delicate hotel with buckets of character."
April 2014,Top marks to 41 - a real luxury home from home - just up the road from 'her majesty's place',"That this hotel is amongst the best in London comes as no surprise - I hadn't realised it's actually No.1 in TA!  First impressions - it's true that some taxi drivers are not aware of it but they all seem to know the Rubens next door so it's no problem. The front doors open directly on to B.P. Road but no worries.  As soon as your taxi arrives outside your cases are whisked away in double quick time and re-appear in your room a little later.  What immediately struck me was the wood panelling, the polished brass and the gentleman's club feel (or at least how I imagine them to be since I've never set foot in one). Service is exemplary from the word go.  Up to the fifth floor and past a multitude of black and white framed cartoons on the wall (not of the Tom and Jerry variety I…"
March 2014,Pampering at its best,"Just returned from a two night stay here and will return. Felt very pampered from arrival to departure. The staff are attentive without being intrusive. Romantic turndown very special as are the little gifts each evening. The executive lounge is a haven of relaxation and very nice food, full English very good. I enjoyed discovering new things in the room and executive lounge. Amazing drench shower. Great location for transport and sights."
March 2014,fabulous hotel,"This small hotel is so discreet it would be easy to miss it, next to Reubens, easy walk to the palace and parks, Victoria Station and  theatre. We had a delightful 1 night stay here, just wish it had been longer. The room was a good size comfortable  and clean, very stylish (love the black and white carpet) with big bed (thick soft mattress topper) small sofa, and everything we needed.  Lovely touches like the glass of champagne while we checked in, fruit and chocolates on the table,  soft music playing, rose petals and candles lit around the room when we got back from our night out. The red petals  looked so pretty in the black and white room. All made our stay extra, extra special. Plenty of lovely toiletries, gowns, towels etc. in the small bathroom.   The lounge/reception is…"
November 2013,Not really impressed,"Stayed at this hotel last November and was somewhat disappointed to be honest.I keep on reading rave reviews about this place but I've actually stayed in better B & B's around the country. It's very expensive for what's on offer and I probably would return if the price was reduced by 50%. There are alot of expensive gadgets in the bedroom that are probably seldom used ( e.g. TV in long narrow bathroom that is almost impossible to view - then why would you want to of course ? Not really for me I'm afraid to say. There are far better places to stay in London for the price ( like 5* hotels ) Apologies , but too many reasons against recommending this hotel as being one of the best in London."
March 2014,Fantastic romantic hotel,"Hotel 41 is a fantastic little hotel, in the heart of London. The service is super, the rooms are nicen and the whole place is like living in an old english mansion. We loved it and will come back some other time."
February 2014,Another great visit,Hotel 41 never let's me down. Staff amazing - food awesome  rooms so comfortable great bathroom -had a two story room with fireplace and sitting area. Very quiet  see you next year :) location location location
January 2014,Magical,"Our first time to London and so much to see and do.  An amazing city!  That said, the Hotel 41 was a big highlight of our trip and we would fly from Canada again just to spend time at this Hotel.  The management and staff are truly special in how they made us feel very comfortable and catered to our every desire making us feel like royalty.  A special thanks to Monika.  From the second you walk into this hotel it is very unique and warm feeling.  Our room was spacious, very functional, and romantic.  The beautifully designed lounge was quaint, and we always looked forward to spending time there at the end of a long day of sightseeing to relax and enjoy great food by the fireplace or in a cozy corner playing chess.  The staff really go out of their way to cater to your every need…"
February 2014,A wonderful place to remember!,"I booked the executive king room for my boyfriends 25th birthday and from start to finish the service and atmosphere was old school class. I couldn't fault anything about this hotel and truly feel like I have found a treasure in London. Brilliant for romance, quality time with your other half and full of pleasant surprises. Great location and scrumptious selection of food, drink and breakfast in the morning. I couldn't suggest booking Hotel 41 enough if only for one night it is really worth every penny! The staff make this hotel and it was a breath of fresh air to feel so well looked after.  "
January 2014,We loved the hotel and its staff.,"This hotel has excellent location. The services were very pleasant. room was very clean, nice decorated and quit too. The restaurant serve good foods, Just wonderful.For sure I would stay here. Definitely worthed for the money..."
February 2014,Fabulous hotel,As an extra treat for my husbands birthday I booked into hotel 41 for two nights. The whole stay was wonderful primarily due to the care and attention the staff and management discreetly provide. Many a large hotel could take a leaf out of the lengths of service this little gem of a hotel provides its guests. There are an abundance of excellent little touches like raid the pantry and champagne on arrival that also add to the experience. It is also worth highlighting that if you are looking for a romantic couple of days in the capital then the hotel goes a long way to make it memorable!
February 2014,Amazing,"Stayed here for my 21st birthday as a surprise from my boyfriend. I've never been anywhere and been treated so nicely. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff there. I was given roses and chocolates and surprised with a 'romantic turndown' in the room which was amazing. We were given a room upgrade as it was a special occasion, and the hotel arranged our entire evening when we went to see Billy Elliot. They booked our tickets which were right at the front in the middle and got me a signed programme which they left on the dinner table which was also covered in rose petals.  The pantry where you can eat complimentary food throughout the day is also delicious! came back after Billy Elliot and we had bread and salamis and cheeses and haagen daaz! It was an amazing and…"
April 2014,The reviews are accurate,"Just got back from a four-night stay at this wonderful boutique hotel, and I have to say that all of the positive reviews are completely accurate. I was almost a bit suspicious when booking the hotel, given how overwhelmingly positive the reviews were. But this really is a wonderful little hotel, with fantastic service, an excellent location, and all sorts of little touches that make it a very unique place to stay.  I won't repeat what is in the other reviews, other than to confirm that service was fantastic throughout - very attentive, responsive, and super-friendly. Our room (an executive king) was very spacious and very tastefully decorated. Bathroom a bit small, but perfectly adequate. We got an in-facing room, which didn't have much of a view, but made up for it by being…"
April 2014,My 40th birthday at this fantastic hotel. ,"My husband booked this amazing hotel for my 40th birthday for a three night stay. All the staff at Hotel 41 made you feel, comfortable, welcome and very very valued. From the champagne on arrival to the amazing breakfast in the executive lounge, the romantic turndown after our dinner out one evening, the complementary canapés every night, the soft music playing on arrival to our suite, the beautiful cheesecake birthday cake on the table in our suite when we arrived. Everything from start to finish was faultless. The little finishing touches too, the his and hers slippers which are so comfortable as well as the gorgeous Penhaligons toiletries in the bathroom.  Not a thing is missed and I would not hesitate to book this hotel again. Just wish I could afford to take my husband back…"
April 2014,Simply excellent...........,Meeting friends flying in from the US and we needed somewhere to stay that was going to tick all the right boxes. Can't fault a thing. Need somewhere that does everything a 5 star hotel should do then this is the place. Will return again when next in London.
April 2014,Amazing experience,This hotel is a truly amazing experience.You are spoilt from the moment you are shown through the front door. The staff are incredible and make you feel very special  When in London we will not stay anywhere else. What a find !!!
April 2014,Superb!,"We stayed here after seeing it as the #1 spot on trip advisor.  Let me be the first to tell you that this will be the only place we stay when visiting London in the future.  The staff are second to none making you feel like family and royalty in a very homey way. We were attending a wedding so we had plenty of dining experiences but every time we came back to our hotel they seemed to top it w something even better. From the unique tasty appetizers to the cold bar w freshly sliced Salmon, cheeses paté and much more, available till the wee hours of the am. Open bar, ice cream, champagne and goid rum which is hard to come across sometimes in Europe,  they had it all. Well done guys, David , z German,  and the entire staff who made it AWESOME! !!!"
April 2014,"5* exclusive, intimate, felt like a VIP","Just stayed at hotel 41 and it was a one of a kind experience. Upon welcome to the hotel you are made to feel important and special. It has an exclusive feel to it with only a few rooms, small reception area and lovely lounge area. All the extra touches are very special. Drink on arrival. Personal greeter. Personal check in. Rooms are lovely. Beautifully decorated and have everything you need including a fireplace. Our DVD player didn't work but the staff worked non stop until it did and they could not do enough to make up for it including bringing cocktails to our room and wavering the drinks we had throughout our stay. The pantry was amazing. We didn't need to eat out. Good quality ingredients which can be said for breakfast also which was amazing. Hope to return soon. It…"
March 2014,Just fantastic!,We stayed at Hotel 41 as a belated 30th Wedding Anniversary celebration and had also booked to go on the Raymond Blanc dinner on the Orient Express.  We were treated like royalty by the hotel staff from the moment we arrived until we left and I can safely say that this was the best hotel experience we have ever had.  We were upgraded to a junior suite and the room was superb and the bed massive and comfortable.  The staff were attentive and considerate at all times and made the stay perfect for us both.    Many thanks to all at the hotel for making this trip so much more enjoyable and we would not hesitate to return - in fact I am really looking forward to it!!
April 2014,All around perfection!!,"Me and my girlfriend, stayed here for five days in April 2014. From the start to our departure everything was amazing, the staff were extremely helpful and beyond accommodating, the food was amazing, and all around just incredible! The only negative is the shadow this has cast on our current hotel in Venice, if we are in London again we will definitely be returning!"
May 2013,Great hotel & great experience.,Great hotel & great experience.  I've stayed here once with the Soho was fully booked and could not have been more pleased.  The rooms each have character and the hotel staff is very accommodating.  I highly recommend this hotel.
November 2013,Luxury!,I had the pleasure of staying at this amazing hotel last year. what can I say but wow! Everything was perfect from our arrival to our departure! The staff are very welcoming and hard working! Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone!
February 2014,Amazing hotel & staff,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying here for 4 nights in February, 2014.  We splurged and booked the conservatory suite.  Everything from check-in to departure was perfect.  The room was absolutely beautiful with all the amenities you could need.  Having the extra space was very comfortable.  The staff, each and everyone, truly went above and beyond to make sure you enjoyed your stay.  The snacks and treats in the lounge were wonderful and we were able to take advantage of ""plundering the pantry"" a few times.  This was our first time to London and the location worked out perfectly for everything we wanted to do.  It seemed as though everything was within walking distance.  You really feel as though you're in your own private little part of London.   Thank you to all the…"
April 2014,Its Amazing,"what an excellent experience, from arrival to departure the service is world class. The staff know who you are and are extremely welcoming and totally efficient.  champagne on arrival, clear explanation of how anything works. In the room that have thought, and do think of everything. We had his and his slipper bags as opposed to standard his and hers.  Personal notes in the room handwritten. Every T is crossed and every I is dotted.  LOVED IT"
April 2014,Best hotel in London,"Stayed here for one night whilst we went to the theatre. I was so impressed with the staff and the little extras that this will now be our default hotel for London. The staff were far and away the most genuinely friendly and helpful staff we have experienced in the UK.  Some of the little but special touches were: - staff remembering your itinerary so always one step ahead, including flagging a taxi down as soon as I emerged from the lift - always offering something extra, such as an umbrella and bottle of water on the way out or professionally wrapping the flowers I had bought for my wife so I could carry them on the train - arranging spots in the hotel for me to have business meetings and caring as much for my guests as they did for me - the free snacks, canapés and late night…"
April 2014,Incredible hotel and the best hotel I have stayed at in London,"This is quite simply a totally amazing experience. The staff are superb and nothing is too much trouble. They all remember your name and are incredibly helpful. The room was beautifully decorated and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. The lounge area is beautiful and relaxing and you get given canapés and snacks with your drinks. There is an honesty bar and the ""pantry"" food is very good. I can't wait to go back again. The location is super and it is such a treat to find a hotel like this in a big city. Loved it!"
March 2014,very good,"I was stay at Hotel 41 for 2 nights. I was really impressed with their service. My room was also very nice, clean and large. The staffs were helpful too. I really like this hotel and would like to come back here again."
March 2014,Wonderful,"We only stayed one night but now looking forward to a return visit. We received a warm welcome, friendly efficient service, nothing was too much trouble. Pleasant room and very comfortable bed. Loved the idea of 'raiding the pantry' post theatre. Home from home feel in the lounge. Food excellent. Good central location."
March 2014,Feels like you are in a movie!,"I love this hotel. Its ambiance makes you feel like you are back in Twin Peaks times...! The lift has only one floor to chose...5th floor. Would be nice to call it 4 1/2 or something. Black and white decor, very friendly people, excellent kitchen and breakfast and very good location. What else can you ask for? Only small downside is, I called a week later to inquire if they found something I lost but they never got back to me..."
March 2014,A perfect London Hotel!,"My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41 for 9 nights while in London.  We were impressed well beyond our expectations.  The hotel was very clean and quiet and well located, very close to Victoria Station.  The staff were exceptional - always friendly and extremely professional. They even arranged for rose petals to be strewn in our room when they learned it was my birthday.  We have stayed in many hotels in North America, Europe, Hawaii and Asia and this hotel is by far the very best we have come across.  You won't regret booking here!"
March 2014,My new favourite London Hotel,"What can I say! Just book it!!  This is one the best hotels I have ever stayed in for service. they  say nothing is too much trouble and it really is. Our arrival was delayed 24hrs by a flight issue but Hotel 41 were great and had our transfer rearranged. Lovely car waiting for us on arrival and easy check in despite is being 6.30am. They felt bad for our delay so added a complimentary breakfast to our stay. We had a lovely champagne afternoon tea, the happy hour drinks and nibbles are amazing and the plunder the pantry is incredible. The selection of drinks/nibbles always on offer is a real benefit. Our room was an executive king room and was really lovely with everything you could need at your finger tips.  Can not recommend this hotel enough. It's not cheap but with all the…"
March 2014,Fantastic,"Loved that this hotel is not boringly ""corporate"". From the friendly, helpful front desk on, it feels different and special, like a private club. Staff all very friendly and professional.  The lounge is bright, airy and comfortable.  The room was large with excellent bathroom with bath plus separate shower. Plenty of wardrobe and storage space and loved all the extra touches, especially the candles burning in the bathroom when we came back, chocs, olives etc etc.  Comfy robes (but would have liked the slippers immediately - they arrived with the ""turn down"").  Good curtains/blinds kept the light out (but I think a little maintenance is needed to the blind). Quiet.  Spotlessly clean.  Provided everything you could possibly want and more (including the essentials for a spot of…"
March 2014,Best Kept Secret in London,Recently spent 4 nights in London at Hotel 41.  This is the best kept secret in London.  It is a great location within walking distance of many attractions.    The service from the moment we walked in the door was nothing short of superb.  The amenities and service of a 5 star hotel with the cozy feel and intimacy of a B&B is the best way I can describe the experience.  We will definitely stay here on our next visit to London.  
July 2013,Marvelous!,"One of the top notel to stay in London. Great service to help you for all problems. Rooms are large and very clean, bathrooms wonderfull. We strongly suggest if you want to have a perfect stay in London!"
March 2014,"""Out of this World!""","Booked Hotel 41 having google searched for top hotels in London and thereafter reading the reviews on this site.  Everything sounded and looked amazing and fitted our needs so I couldn't resist and booked. Was my 40th birthday celebration and it was magical from start to finish.  The Hotel is absolutely stunning and pristine, the staff are so polite and attentive without being pretentious.  Its all about the service at this place, they truly want you to have the best experience ever and you will not be disappointed. We were lavished with champagne on arrival and then a complimentary bottle (and a very expensive one too!) in our room for my birthday celebrations.  Very romantic turndown at night and Happy Birthday cheesecake in room when we returned from the theatre. We chose to…"
March 2014,Five stars are not enough!!,"Our stay at Hotel 41 was a totally unique experience.  We have stayed in good, even great, hotels before but this one is very different.  The hotel is limited by its size but this is a positive thing since the staff are able to know the guests and their preferences and able to service their needs in an exclusive, personal and yet unobtrusive way. Nothing is too much trouble.  Consideration and sensitivity are paramount. We mentioned that we had Grandma babysitting our three children at home - on checking out we were given a box of beautiful and assorted sweets for our children, chocolates for my mother-in law and coffee and water to-go for our journey - just one more, of the many aspects that sets the hotel apart. Somehow the five stars seem inadequate since there is an apparent…"
March 2014,A magical stay,We booked Hotel 41 primarily due to it's ideal location for our needs and excellent sets of reviews which gave us confidence that we would have a good stay.  I have to say that we were delighted that our experience exceeded our already high expectations.  The hotel itself is wonderfully comfortable but what really made it stand out for us was the superbly accommodating and attentive staff.  It's the small details that make the difference and at Hotel 41 no detail is overlooked.     I cannot recommend Hotel 41 highly enough and will happily return there on my next city break in central London.  If you are looking for a treat you will do the same.
March 2014,Exceeded expectations,"The problem with reading so many great reviews about a place is that you set your own expectations very high indeed. I can say that having just spent Saturday night at this hotel, as part of a special big birthday surprise, the hotel, service, room and food were excellent. It is not a formal or pretentious place, just comfortable and welcoming. The staff are excellent and having only stayed in large impersonal hotels before, it was a lovely experience to be treated so well. It delivered not only everything we were expecting, but much more. Yes, it cost more than we would usually pay, but was absolutely worth the extra. We will stay here again, for sure."
March 2014,Looking forward to next time,"We have stayed in this hotel for the 3 rd time once again amazing service,amazing room,amazing time. We have stayed here as a couple and also as a family with our children. The staff are great with the children. Although the hotel is beautiful ,clean ,and luxury rooms. It's the staff that makes us come back. We look forward to our next stay with 41"
March 2014,I'd move in if I could,"Like being a member of a private club. Discreet, private entrance. Always welcomed back by name. The included executive lounge is an important part of the experience. Great location, across from buckingham. "
February 2014,Couldn't of been better,enjoyed everyday I stayed here. everyone was super friendly and attentive. great cozy rooms. would most definitely stay here if i have the chance. really memorable stay. and the food was to die for!  highly recommend.
March 2014,Fifth floor haven,If you want quiet and luxuriously comfortable place to come back to after a busy day out and about in London then this is it. We stayed for two nights for our 28th wedding anniversary and it was quite simply the best service we have ever received in a hotel. The romantic turndown was simply beautiful. Breakfast was delicious and our needs were often anticipated; no request was considered trivial and there seemed to be a genuine desire on the part of all staff to help make our stay as pleasant as possible. I honestly don't know how you create that through training. We had delightful afternoon tea and later when we returned from an evening at the theatre we enjoyed the relaxed library lounge (styled like a private club) where we enjoyed a snack and drink with their 'Plunder the…
March 2014,Fantastic stay,"one of the best hotels I have stayed in the world, Service from second arriving is like you are Royalty in fact thought I had booked into Buckingham palace next door by mistake.  Bedrooms are fresh and well appointed and the food at both locations was superb"
March 2014,A very special place! Note the taxis tip!,"Hotel 41 is about as special as it gets.   Firstly a tip.....most London cabbies will not have heard of it! This is not a negative, it's indicative of the exclusive nature of the place. Because of its small size and it's reputation only a lucky few get to stay there!  The Hotel Rubens is right next door and the cabbie will know that one!  Enough has been said about the quality of the place in other reviews which I fully concur with however what sets a hotel apart is the response when something goes wrong. In my case an afternoon tea where the finger sandwiches were dry. A quiet word saw the whole effort removed, an apology after 10 minutes because the manager was still not happy when she checked the replacement which was duly sent back with (I suspect blunt words to the chef to…"
March 2014,A perfect romantic weekend!,"I stayed at this hotel for one night with my girlfriend, in a junior suite with the romantic package. After a show and dinner we returned to find the suite covered with roses, the bath full and chocolates on the bed! It was perfect. The room was great, very clean, and the room service food was excellent. The staff were great and overall it was a fantastic experience. I recommend this hotel."
March 2014,London lodging at its best,"We were guests at 41 for 6 days in March and our experience was unmatched by any other hotel we've stayed at.  From the time we were greeted at the door, we felt as though the hotel was there only for us.  The attention of the staff went beyond professional.  All were friendly and accommodating in the very best tradition of 5 star hotels.  The attention of the staff -- from the general manager, Malcolm Hendry to the resident managers Lauren and Monika to the wait staff -- made us feel valued and respected on all counts.  Requests for dining suggestions, tour routes, directions to destinations, reservations and travel schedules were all answered promptly and efficiently.  If you can stay in only one place in London, ask the taxi driver to take you to 41.  He may not know where it…"
January 2014,Extremely Disappointed,"Re: Hotel 41, 41 Buckingham Palace Road, London SW1WOPS. My wife and I stayed in “Hotel 41” for three nights in January 2014 I purposely booked Trip Advisor’s No.1 Luxury 5 Star Hotel in London. We had previously stayed in the No. 4 rated hotel, the Corinthia, which was excellent but as this was a special occasion I thought I would go better and go to the best – how disappointing.  In no way does this hotel live up to the standard of a 5 star hotel. My wife described it as a luxury   B &B and we are dumbfounded as to how it achieved its rating from Trip Advisor as being the No. 1, 5 star luxury hotel in London. Here are our comments:- If this is the best 5 star Luxury Hotel in London it must cast a shadow on all other 5 star hotels in the city. Our experience of the 41 would…"
March 2014,Simply the best 5 star hotel we have ever stayed at!,"Let me start by saying we normally stay in 5 star hotels. We have stayed at the Ritz, Mandarin and many other high end 5 star hotels around the world.  This was without a doubt the best.  The hotel itself only has 29 rooms/suites. There is a lovely reading room you walk into, this is the place you dine and sit while you wait for your room.  Upon checking in we where presented with four different choices of champagne. Not just the cheap stuff either. We had a choice from 4 great brands. We both opted for the Veuve clique (one of our favourites). Two large glasses of free champagne later we were lead to our room.  The room itself was lovely large, spacious. Great views.  The room itself had sky TV in, this is a first for any hotel we have stayed in.  The shower was nothing short…"
March 2014,Unbelievable,"Certainly the best choice in London. Excellent location, near some of the most attractive points. The best of all is a higher level of service from the hotel management and staff. I had the great pleasure of staying at the Hotel 41 and would recommend it to anyone without reservation."
March 2014,Bob on.,"Perfect and very comfortable exclusive hotel. Loads of freebies, one needn't venture out really. Will stay longer next time. No grumbles what so ever. Highly recommended.  Some rooms are better than others.   "
March 2014,What a great experience!,"What a top notch hotel. I am not even done with our stay and am compelled to write a review based on the level of service from the hotel management and staff.    When we arrived we were greeted and given champagne. After all the paperwork we were shown around the hotel and went to our room. When we arrived there were a few issues with the room (TV didn't work properly, shower handle broke, and the toilette made a lot of noise). We brought it to managements attention and they took care of it the next morning while we were out.  Once we got back everything was fixed. In addition, we were given an upgraded room with complimentary champagne. Based on our current experiences I would give six out of five stars."
February 2014,"Your Own Exclusive, Private Club in the Heart of London","I had the great pleasure of staying at the Hotel 41 for a short 3 day holiday with my husband to celebrate my 35th birthday.  I have stayed at some beautiful hotels around the world, including in London, but there was something special about Hotel 41.  The hotel is very small - just one floor - but it feels very exclusive and private feel.  The main lounge/library is absolutely gorgeous, and is the center of activity at the hotel -- it's where you check in, have breakfast, and can lounge around with a drink or cup of tea after a day of sightseeing.  It has a  lovely fireplace, and my only complaint about my visit was that every time I went to the lounge, the spots next to the fireplace were always taken!  It's the kind of space you don't want to leave.    The rooms are…"
December 2013,Another perfect Christmas at 41!,"This is our 3rd stay at 41, our second time at Christmas and yet again it was faultless.  It really is like coming to stay with good friends as everyone makes you feel so at home. From remembering the music you like, or don't like, to the lovely surprise when we came back to our room from Christmas night drinks just a little too early!!! All the team were great as usual, but particular thanks go to Lauren, Florent and Stefan for making us feel so special.  We felt totally relaxed and pampered for the whole stay and can't wait to come back again."
January 2014,Absolutely marvellous hotel,"I have now stayed here twice, once on business and once with my wife as a treat for her birthday. I would now easily rate it as my favourite London hotel.  You enter on the ground floor, and are then taken up to the 5th floor, where the hotel itself is situated. You are offered a glass of champagne as you book in in a beautiful lounge, lined with old books. The rooms themselves are extremely well-appointed and comfortable, and I also specifically want to mention the staff who are a model of courtesy and helpfulness. The wireless internet is free.  We were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a junior suite for my most recent stay, and the room was stunning, with an upstairs and downstairs!   I received an e mail before my stay, inviting me to state preferences such as foam or…"
August 2013,Great Stay!,"My husband and I stopped over in London for one night before boarding a cruise ship to The United States.  Hotel 41 is a great place to stay!  The hotel is quiet, quaint and the staff is there to help with anything 24/7.  From the second we walked in the door, to the moment we caught our cab to the train station, everything was perfect.  When we arrived to our room initially, they had a beautiful spread of fruit, chocolates and roses laid out for me as a gift for our wedding.  I was very impressed.  The room was a nice size, super clean.  Would definitely recommend for a boutique, personalized experience!  (Walking Distance to Buckingham Palace, too!)"
December 2013,The Perfect Place To Stay,"My daughter and I plus 2 dogs had a 3 night break at Hotel 41. My expectations were high, from website and reputation and we certainly were not disappointed. In fact everything we experienced surpassed expectation. All the staff were attentive, polite and friendly. The bedroom was compact yet perfect, beds were wonderfully comfortable, as, I imagine the dog beds were. We loved sitting in front of the fire with friends (and dogs) in the evening. The pantry nibbles were irresistible.  Overall it was an excellent hotel, would recommend it without hesitation and shall return as soon as I have an excuse to do so. Thank you Hotel 41"
January 2014,Other worldly,"My daughter and I throughly enjoyed our week at Hotel 41.  It truly felt more like a home than a hotel, location close to Victoria station was great and the staff was exceptional!  The room was lovely and spotless, the food and beverage department top notch and the executive lounge so inviting and peaceful. Thank you so much Monica for the unexpected but truly appreciated treat!  It was like a palace!  Thank you everyone for making our trip magical. Only complaint...we had to leave!"
January 2014,Amazing team of staff,A really well located hotel. It has rather compact dimensions for those used to larger hotels. But the sheer size of the effort and care from the team was world class. We were so well taken care of we had a great New Year. A boutique cutie.
January 2014,Exceptional hotel,"The staff does everything right in this quaint boutique hotel near Buckingham Palace.  A great place to make your home while in London.   Fabulous.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else.   Before arriving, they send you a request list.  The little things are what really impressed me.  A bottle of bubbly waits for you.   Breakfast was fabulous.  They have a great ""honor"" bar if you want to make yourselves a drink. The complete opposite of a big chain hotel experience.    While it is not cheap, it represents great value.  I felt like I was staying in a nice London home.  The executive lounge is cosy and free wifi worked great.   "
December 2013,Great for the family!,We loved this hotel for our two kids ages 6 and 9. They had gluten free toast in the morning in addition to their gorgeous breakfast - and their snacks late night were delicious.  The staff was amazing with our kids and lovely without being overly on top of you (like at the Park Hyatt on Paris). It was by far the most interesting experience we have had - and have now decided to find other boutique hotels after this wonderful visit. 
December 2013,(Cliche Alert) A Hidden Gem!,"This was a surprise birthday trip planned by my wife in mid December. I knew we were staying in London at a hotel, but that was as much info as she was prepared to divulge. Clearly it was going to be somewhere very special.. and indeed it was! Coming off a wet and windy street through a tiny door into total opulence; and having a glass of champagne almost immediately thrust into my hand just took my breath away as I processed the surroundings. The fire! The chandeliers! The comfy chairs! The ice cream on tap! This was my kind of place and my wife clearly knew it. We were shown to the Balmoral suite which was approximating the size of our ground floor with its 4 TVs, sofas, tables, huge bed; I could go on with the superlatives but it would be overkill if I did.  Suffice to say…"
December 2013,A wonderful stay.....again!,"This was our second stay at hotel 41 and yet again we had an amazing time. We were welcomed back like old friends and made to feel very special.  We were given a different room this time and it was beautiful, we asked for a quiet room with lovely views and that's exactly what we got. Nothing is ever too much trouble for them and your every need is catered for. All of the little touches are what makes this place extra special, such as the champagne on arrival, the 'plunder the pantry', the lovely dressing gowns and the luxurious Penalagans  products....... I could go on but you really do just need to go along and experience it all for yourself, you will not be disappointed."
February 2014,Delightful,I have stayed in a lot if hotels in my lifetime and this one definitely stands out. Genuine attention to detail with a smile  is not something that is easy to instil in the staff.. That is because they must really enjoy what they do.. And this wonderful boutique has pulled it off in virtually every category. From choice and quality of champagnes to supplying plasters (band aids). Your attention and friendliness right from the entrance to departure sets you a class above the rest.. And the Eggs Royale were definitely the best I gave tasted!  Congrats to all staff! 
February 2014,Fantastic,"Wow!!! What a beautiful boutique hotel this is. Fantastic staff who are never overbearing, but always on hand to help if needed. The rooms were large enough and well decorated.  The complimentary food and nibbles means you never go hungry for long. The location is also great for visiting Buckingham Palace which is a stones throw away. Maybe not the cheapest hotel available but you get what you pay for - first class service and any needs catered for. Thanks again to all the staff for making this a truly memorable Valentines stay."
February 2014,My new favourite,"Having a very romantic boyfriend, I have been lucky enough to stay in some gorgeous hotels. He booked us in to the conservatory suite of hotel 41 for valentines. It was a gorgeous split level suite with a glass roof, open fireplace, the most comfy bed and all the mod cons you could need. The bathroom had a corner jacuzzi bath, stand up rainfall shower and a mirrored ceiling. The suit was decorated beautifully in a monochrome theme. We also had a bouquet of flowers and champagne on ice on arrival. My boyfriend had arranged this prior to arrival and you could tell great care had been taken to set this up. We went out for dinner and whilst enjoying drinks in the lounge, staff had put more champagne in the room with roses, scattered petals throughout the suite, beautifully arranged…"
February 2014,What a Gem,"Stayed for one night on business and found it via a random search on the web. I always book direct with the hotel and the booking process was easy. Upon arrival at this chique, boutique hotel I was taken to check in at the lounge and offered a glass of champagne. From then one the level of service, attention to detail was exemplary. My US colleagues stayed at the Marriott, Park Lane for  room 4 pounds cheaper, bio prizes for guessing which was the better value. Although I was unable to enjoy it for long everything, even to a take away latte when I checked out was outstanding. Turn down service included lit candles and fresh fruit waiting for me. Lounge had snacks during the afternoon and an honour bar. Great location, great staff, great hotel. We will be back. I have already…"
February 2014,Another fantastic stay,I can't praise the service and hospitality at hotel 41 enough. We have stayed at the hotel several times both as a couple and as a family with 3 children. The staff can not do enough for you and it's the personal touches that make it such a wonderful experience.
February 2014,The perfect hideaway,This is a beautiful hideaway right in the centre of London.  I cannot speak too highly of this hotel.  We were celebrating a landmark birthday and the excellent staff insured that our stay was as near perfect as possible.  I would like to return - something I have not said in any of my many reviews on this site.
February 2014,Oasis in Victoria,"This was booked as a anniversary celebration to see what the top hotel in our home city was like. We were greeted by the concierge, who sits on his own downstairs, and then waited for a receptionist to take us (sans luggage) to the 5th floor Executive Lounge to check in. We were offered a choice of welcome Champagnes and then taken to our room, where our case was waiting (they also bought the Champagne to our room).  Excellent start! Even better - we had been upgraded to the Balmoral suite, which was a huge room, with a separate lounge area, three bathrooms (one small, but with a big and fast-filling bath, one with just a shower), two of which had heated floors. There was a welcome ""Happy Anniversary"" cheesecake (lovely) and petit fours and bottles of water.  We also liked the…"
January 2014,Utterly delightful hotel!,"We recently stayed at Hotel 41 and could not have enjoyed our stay more.    The rooms are charming, and the fact that many have gas fireplaces make them unusual in London as well as a cozy place to rest after a long day.  The Lounge area with its snacks, comfy couches and old world decor only add to the feeling of homeyness.  But, as previous reviewers have mentioned, the staff is what really make this hotel perfect.  They are welcoming, quickly know your name, and greet you warmly.  Everyone on the staff strives to be helpful and will go the extra mile to make sure you have everything to make your stay as pleasant as possible.  The Concierge was quickly responsive via email.  From a business traveler perspective, the WiFi was consistent and taxis were plentiful.  The staff…"
January 2014,At Home in London.,"I simply can't thank Hotel 41 enough for their tremendous support, kindness & individual attention to absolutely everything. I have lost count the times we have stayed, sometimes a visit to london in unhappy circumstances, others times more positive ~ A roller coaster few months. 41 is the ultimate and most certainly the most fabulous without any doubt, regardless of your reason for staying there. Everyone genuinely cares & you will feel wonderfully special. An extra enormous thank you to Lauren, alongside Monika & Cara. You have been simply super to Andrew & I.Lxx"
January 2014,My absolute first choice ,"Business or pleasure Hotel 41 is my new first choice in London. I have to stay away from home often and so when I do it's good to be somewhere that is inclusive and service focussed. 41 has kind and attentive staff, lovely rooms and good food if you chose to eat in. I love it here and will be making it my base when in London"
January 2014,Absolutely perfect,"A perfect service (special thanks to Florent!), an extremely cosy lounge and comfortable room, perfect welcome and room service, great décoration and attention to clients. Just food quality could be improved...sorry we are French ;-) be sure we will come back! "
January 2014,Love it every time!,"We have stayed here now 3 times and every time is just as good as the first. It feels like a family inside the city. The staff is consciences, kind, respectful, and wonderful. A jewel-perfect for business, family, or romance. Can't wait for our next visit!!  It is especially cozy at Christmas time with the decorations!"
January 2014,fantastic,"OK, we're not use to 5 stars hotels. But even though, the week-end we've spent there was just fantastic and worth every penny! I highly recommend the 41 if you're looking for something very very special."
January 2014,Wonderful Anniversary Weekend Stay,"Stayed on 25th Jan for a 25th Anniversary weekend. We had an amazing stay at ""41"", from the moment we arrived the staff made us feel incredibly welcome and special; from the Champagne reception to attentive staff and the little extras in the beautifully decorated rooms, it was a very pleasant surprise and 100% lived up to the reviews I had read All in all an amazing experience, so pleased we chose this hotel for our anniversary weekend away, we will be recommending to all our friends and family who want a special stay in London"
December 2013,outstanding!!!,we were in utter awe and amazement by everything about this place!!!!   it topped any other top hotel we've ever stayed at!!!!  what a gem:)  i think it's london's best kept secret!!  the library feel and coziness and food were all too perfect!!!!!
January 2014,It doesn't get better than this for sure,Lovely hotel very knowledgeable staffs abd friendly too. The view we had was fantastic.  Very close to all tourist attraction.  All in all very good. The tube station is just a minute walk from the hotel. 
January 2014,Wonderful find! Amazing service,We stayed on 25/01/14 for my husbands 40th birthday. From the moment we entered the hotel it was apparent that the service is second to none. Wonderful decor and the friendly attentive staff made for a truly memorable stay.
January 2014,London's little gem,"Arrived at the hotel door which could have doubled for that of a 'Gentleman's Club,' of course it was Hotel 41. Once through the door after being buzzed in you are  greeted by a very friendly receptionist, she makes a call to a member of staff who then comes to escort you to the 5th floor and into the Executive Lounge.  You are again greeted by more friendly staff members. The Executive lounge is the heart beat of the hotel, the staff more than make you feel welcome and at ease, their attentiveness, it's what the hotel is all about.   The room was adequate, the king size bed an obvious bonus. The bathrooms are larger than most, the showers were a little bit of a challenge. The English Breakfast was disappointing being a vegetarian, there were no alternatives and what they charge…"
January 2014,A gem of a hotel,"We stayed at Hotel 41 on 22nd January on a trip to London to see a couple of shows.  I had not previously been aware of this hotel but my wife and I were tremendously impressed with the whole experience. The service is outstanding and the staff were unfailingly helpful with any requests, including generously allowing us to check out an hour later than normal.  This enabled us to visit The Queen's Gallery, almost opposite, the following morning without having to rush. A glass of champagne on arrival, especially of the quality offered, cannot fail to create an instant feel-good factor and a top-up as we relaxed by the open fire showed that it was more than just a standard gesture.  The room itself was beautifully furnished with a well co-ordinated black and white scheme - in fact…"
January 2014,As good as it gets,"First stay for my wife and I, last Saturday to celebrate her birthday, we try and stay at a good hotel for our birthdays every year, this is the second Red Carnation Hotel that we have stayed at.  From the moment we stepped through the door the staff were welcoming and attentive, a choice of champagne and some savoury snacks with check-in. Our room was lovely, we had an Executive King, enormous comfortable bed, complimentary birthday cake and fruit. The room was well equipped with most things that you might need for a short stay and beautifully finished. The room had marble fireplace and a wrought iron gas fire which was more for effect than heat, but quite a nice feature.. It may not have been the biggest or best room that we have stayed in London, but where this hotel…"
December 2013,Really the best.,"One of my favorites! Very comfortable and homey. Nice to sit in front of the fire and sip hot chocolate. Rooms are cozy, black and white prevail. Service excellent, small boutique hotel so they always remember your name and what you want before you do. Great breakfast and snacks in the clubroom. Excellent central location, not far from Piccadilly. Been there several times and will definitely be back!"
December 2013,Amazing!!,I love this hotel. We came here for my husbands 30th birthday and everything about our stay here was perfect! The level of customer service provided by all the staff was so far above anything I have experienced at any other hotel. I can't wait for our next trip to the UK to stay at this hotel again!
December 2013,41 Hotel is 5*,"Fantastic stay, from the pillow menu to plunder the pantry. Stayed for a romantic weekend and therd could not have been a better place for it. All perfect. Clean, luxurious, helpful and exclusive. A truly wonderful getaway."
December 2013,incredible!,This hotel was hands down the best place we have ever stayed. The service was of the highest quality with no details forgotten. The small things made this place and I can only praise our stay here. We will definitely be returning! You will not be dissapointed in any sense!
December 2013,Justified #1; sets the standard for boutique hotel luxury,"To celebrate a special occasion, I wanted to select somewhere around Christmas time that would provide a special experience. After much researching and looking at names synonymous with London Luxury from The Ritz to Claridges etc., I settled on Hotel 41.  The communication from the outstanding manager, Mr Hendry, was excellent from the beginning of the booking process. It set a standard and tone of service that was evident in all staff that we had the pleasure of coming in to contact with. From the warm greeting after arriving early in the morning after a long haul flight, to the attention to detail in our room, I could not fault this establishment.  The guest lounge/dining area is an exceptional room, with old world decor that has a sophisticated and contemporary…"
December 2013,Wonderful hotel with excellent service and amazing staff,"Stayed at Hotel 21 for a family break between Christmas and New Year.  This was our first stay, but will definitely not be our last.  Cannot wait to return.  The warm and welcoming staff are incredible.  The atmosphere is calm and tranquil and envelops you as soon as you enter the wonderful lounge. The standard of service is second to none."
December 2013,A wonderful welcome home,"Having spent a wonderful pre Christmas 2012 at Hotel 41 we were delighted to return for the whole of Christmas 2013, enjoying a 3 night stay. And what a wonderful Welcome Home we were given. Hotel 41 is a truly magical place to stay and from beginning to end there is only perfection. We were given the same room as previously and this made us feel even more at home. There are  so many super reviews of Hotel 41 and they are all so true.  There are no superlatives that can really describe a stay at Hotel 41.  It's just something you have to experience for yourself.  And once you have?  Well then you will see just what its all about.  Its all about never wanting to stay anywhere else in London and its about the constant search for somewhere in the World that could possibly meet your…"
December 2013,Home away from home in London,Fantastic staff cosy lounge area with sideboard loaded with various snacks all day stylish room with instant hot water. Our new place to stay in london 20 min walk to theatres and Trafalgar Square Hyde park 10 min away
March 2013,Perfect Christmas in London,"My fiancé and I stayed at Hotel 41 over Christmas (2013) on a five day vacation to London from the States.  It was perfect.  Our enjoyment of London on our trip was due largely to the comfort and excellent service of Hotel 41.  The hotel itself looks and feels like an exclusive private club.  Like you would expect at a private club the staff is first class and is on hand 24 hours a day to help with anything you want.  The hotel, other than the ground floor entrance, is on a single floor with about 20 rooms and a large, extremely comfortable ""clubroom.""  The clubroom has both food and bar service, an inviting fireplace, walls of bookshelves, and in general feels like (and is) the place you want start and end your day. We enjoyed breakfast, pre-dinner drinks, and late night snacks…"
August 2013,Best of London,"We are suprised,we see very good review on the Internet but we dont expect much.When we came into the hotel we are suprised to see old London decor in modern style.The staff is beautiful.Every moment in the hotel we fell like first class.Breakfast in the lounge was fantastic.All in all this the best hotel in London in my opinion."
September 2013,Charming,I have shared this hotel with everyone.  It is beautiful when you walk through the doors and the staff is overwhelmingly delightful.  It is a pleasant surprise to go upstairs.  The location is also perfect.  We will be back.😀
August 2013,"Exquisite, Boutique, Hideaway from reality - in the perfect location!","With only having the opportunity to stay in London for a couple of days I am so glad we chose to stay here, the experience provided by the staff at Hotel 41 was one I will remember as a highlight of our month long vacation. A huge benefit of staying here is the location, we managed to see so many sights of London from the centre point 'Buckingham Palace Road' and what better way to finish off your day of sightseeing than to be relaxing in the Executice Lounge with a glass of champagne and some afternoon tea in front of the fireplace. I would highly recommend this Hotel and I will definitely be staying here again. Well done to the staff at Hotel 41 - outstanding customer service."
September 2013,"Wonderful hotel, Amazing Staff","My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for one week while on vacation in London. Hotel 41 was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in! The staff is incredibly thoughtful and whole experience from check-in to check-out was first class.  The room was much bigger than I would have ever expected. It was my first time in London, but I was expecting a NYC or Chicago sized room. Our room was very comfortable and the bathroom was huge.  We spent many hours in the lounge during our weeklong stay as we had breakfast every morning and many a London Pride in the afternoon and evening. We had never experienced a full English breakfast before and enjoyed sampling every breakfast item available on the menu, including the Kippers. The absolute best thing on the breakfast menu is the smoked…"
August 2013,Amazing stay in London,"We stayed at this hotel for our wedding in the capital.  The hotel is beautiful, the decor is very elegant throughout.  The hotel staff made it a stay to remember, it made our stay even more memorable.  Their attention to detail is fantastic.  We cant wait to stay again!"
September 2013,Very romantic,"We stayed here on our wedding night and it was perfect. The staff were so so friendly and extremely accommodating. You're treated like royalty! It's definitely different and has it own character. Hugely unique. Lovely themed rooms, cute boutique, very contemporary. Feels like a home away from home. Its quite small and the visit was v personal. Lots of personal touches in the room too. Thank you to all the staff for an amazing visit."
September 2013,Excellent indeed,"Old fashioned but stylish hotel in front of Buckingham Palace. You feel like transported in the 19th Century. This is really charming, enchanting, and a change to have people taking care of you all the time. Service is top of the line. Pricey though, but you cannot have this kind of service for peanuts, ( peanuts are free, by the way). I would recommend it, this is really the Bristish experience. I felt like a Princess."
May 2013,Excellent service,"The staff is focused on making your stay as pleasant as possible. It's a great small hotel, rooms are complete but small. 20 minutes walking distance from the mayor shopping areas. There are many good restaurants on walking distance. "
September 2013,Best hotel in Europe,"I actually never write reviews and always look at this site for other people's recommendations!  However, I felt compelled to take the time to write about Hotel 41.  This hotel, hands down, has been the most comfortable, friendly and service orientated hotel I have stayed in Europe.  I travel quite frequently throughout Europe and through London, each time I make sure I stay here.  Monika and Lauren go out of there way to take care of me, my clients and my fiance whenever we are here.  Down to having my favorite beer chilled in the room upon arrival.  Seriously, this is the place to stay in London, once you stay here, you will never stay anywhere else in the city."
September 2013,"If you are in London, explore Hotel 41.  Amazingly feels humble!!","My husband and I had one post-cruise night at Hotel 41 in London, a short walking distance from the Buckingham Palace.  I am telling you their services from the housekeeping services to the general manager was at 20 out of scale 1 to 10.  We have had stayed many hotels around the world but, I mean, this hotel is the best.  Why?  It is a classy boutique style hotel and its staff made you felt like, 'you are a prince/princess' behind the Buckingham Palace building. I tell you they are not fake or business in mind.  They are so natural in pleasing their guests and we feel too humble at their services.  it was truly refreshing.......for their style of graceful services. If you are looking for a hotel in London, you wouldn't ever be sorry for staying this Hotel 41. If we visit London…"
December 2013,Best Part of Our Trip,"My mom and I recently traveled to London for the first time.  We did many of the usual sightseeing things and loved the city, but we both decided that the BEST part of our visit was this hotel. What a hidden gem just steps from Buckingham Palace.  You are treated like royalty the moment you step inside.  We expected the wonderful room but were blown away by the friendly service.  The executive lounge is the gathering location where soft music is playing, champagne is flowing,  the fireplace is alight, and cozy little tables are outfitted with linens, china, and candles.  You nestle into a variety of upholstered chairs and sofas, adjust your pillow, and the cares of your day drift away as the staff brings you hot canapes and glasses of champagne.  After spending an entire day…"
December 2013,Great Gem In A Busy City,We decided to try a new neighborhood in London from previous visits and chose to stay at this boutique hotel.  What a treat.  We arrived tired and the staff greeted it us with such warmth and concern. We were offered a complimentary room to rest in before our room was ready.  We enjoyed a great breakfast in their warm living room with a great glass of champagne. Our room had a very comfortable bed with warm decor.  It is a very inviting little hotel and I know my sister and me would love to stay there again.
December 2013,Perfection once again,A pre-Xmas visit to London has become an annual pilgramage for us and No 41 is a key part of the experience.  From the first moment you step across the threshold to the moment you leave the staff treat you care and respect and look after your every need.  The welcome champagne which is free flowing coupled wth the lovely food bar is a wonderful touch.  The rooms are comfortable and perfectly maintained and very quiet (we had a great nights sleep).  What makes 41 stand out though is the extra care they take in listening to you and making sure you get what you want (for me it was a bag of Twiglets).  We love it and will always return.  Merry Xmas.
December 2013,Like a comfortable pair of slippers,Everything about Hotel 41 was carefully and thoughtfully planned to provide a luxury yet unobtrusive experience. From champagne at check in through to little personal touches in the room. The location of the hotel is excellent and the room was quiet ensuring a good nights sleep. The lounge served a great breakfast too! All in all a great hotel 
December 2013,To be taken care of is worth trying once in a while.,"41 is a small hotel. And small is beautiful a wise man said. He didn't think of 41, but who knows? This place is more a poem, or a work of art, than a hotel. It is not a base camp, it is the peak. You just don't want to leave the bed, the breakfast in bed, the fireplace, the mahogany shrine were afternoon tea or glowing wine is served under the glass roof. Very intimate, but not in an embarrassing manner.The staff is young and tenderly responding to all your needs without showing off. The waiters are descrete in a manner that challenges your pride.  Tranquille, but precise and to the point. British? I think so. Even the lampets have their own rythm. God must have smiled when he created 41 through the imagination of Bea Tollman. When I left I knew that this hotel will be more a…"
December 2013,Great place to stay,This place is really pricey but this is where i stay if im in london for businees or pleasure. I have been to many other estabs over the years but they give you the best. If youre a regular they give extra special srvice.
December 2013,Perfect weekend stay,"I've stayed at Hotel 41 previously and am more than pleased to say that it just doesn't change, you get friendly, attentive service with excellent efficiency, politeness and everything to the high standard you expect, having stayed in most of the top London hotels in the past since discovering 41 I will not stay anywhere else."
December 2013,"Wonderful,wonderful,wonderful!!!","My lovely husband booked a surprise birthday treat for me and we combined a stay at Hotel 41 with a visit to the theatre.  From literally the moment the taxi stopped outside Hotel 41 we were met by warm, attentive staff and nothing was too much trouble. The service was the best we had received anywhere.  Our room was a much needed peaceful haven, every detail was considered.  The quality of linens, towels and fittings are exceptional.  The phone has a button ""anything,anytime"" and that really does sum up the room service.  Upon arrival you are greeted with champagne, what a treat  - very good champagne!!  The food is superb and plundering the pantry after walking back from the theatre was most welcome.  The cheeses, hams, bread and fruit were just amazing, no leftovers here all…"
January 2013,Special Hotel for a Special Occasion,"Excellent service from very professional and caring members of staff in a superb well located boutique hotel with outstanding food, drink and facilities. Traveling to London to receive an award from the Queen was special enough but such an occasion was further enhanced through the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41."
November 2013,super,"Nothing realy special to say because everything was perfect. Thank  you Rooms clean and confortable, fireplace, staff very friendly, central location. We look forward to our return in London. Thank you de ""41"""
October 2013,Family trip to London,"My wife and I had enjoyed our stay at this hidden gem in 2010, and on this trip we brought our 3 children, ages 8, 11 and 16, for a 6 day vacation, their first transatlantic journey.  The junior suites were perfectly sized, and the kids made full use of the ""pantry"" every night.  The central location was an excellent base for adventures within and without the city limits.  If we ever return to London, we will want to stay at ""41""."
October 2013,Great Hotel!!!,"Great hotel, great location, great service. There is a reason they are number 3 on the list, even though they should be higher. My wife and I only stayed for 4 days, but by the end of the stay they knew us by name and how we liked our tea. We had friends staying at the Waldorf Astoria, and they wanted to change to Hotel 41."
October 2013,Five star luxury with a personal touch,"Hotel 41 is small hotel with only 30-some rooms and beside a board room (meeting room) and an executive lounge arrive this is all the facilities there are but they are used to the max.  Rooms are all equipment with all that could be expected of 5 star hotel - Furniture, fabrics and toiletries are all of highest quality. The bed is good.... all is good  What brings 41 to be one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had is the concept of the hotel and the personal attention of a very limited but always present staff  The center and core of the concept is the fantastic lounge where you mingle with staff and the limited number for other guests - The lounge offers various treats and snacks during the day. You can make yourself a drink and you can order food etc all while your are…"
October 2013,We loved it!,"My family recently stayed at ""41"" for several nights. It was fantastic. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. We especially enjoyed having tea in the lounge by the fire. It was a great location - close to the tube and centrally located. Beautiful furnishings and very comfortable. But it was the staff that really made our experience at 41 so great. They did a great job!"
August 2013,What a friendly place!,My wife and I stayed at the 41 foe 3 days in early October. Super friendly staff.  They are always there to help.  Enjoy the delicious snacks they put out throughout the day.  Great location...stones throw to Buckingham palace. Five minute walk to the tube.   This is a great hotel which added toast fantastic stay in London.
April 2013,London,Amazing luxury boutique hotel!!! The service was great and the traditional decor was so comfortable.  It felt like I was in someones traditional mansion rather than a hotel.  The consierge made all my reservations and printed maps.  The would hail my taxi and exchange my money.  Great intimate ambiance.       
October 2013,My favorite hotel in the world.,"My husband and I visited this fine hotel in spring 2011. We brought our 18 month old daughter along. My husband arranged for a car to pick us up at Heathrow and bring us to the hotel. It was a very smooth process and we felt comfortably immediately under the care of PJ. The service and staff are second to none. Everyone knew our daughters name and gave her special attention. We didn't have room to bring our stroller on an international flight, so they loaned us a pink umbrella stroller. The location is just around the corner from Buckingham Palace and within easy walking distance from the train station and the theaters. We enjoyed our stay so much. I want to go back every year.              "
October 2013,"Incredible hotel, impeccable service","Just spent a week with a friend at Hotel 41.  I can't say enough about the staff.  Not only were they formally attired and well groomed, they were friendly, helpful and available for your every need. They also remembered what your plans were for the day and then followed up by asking how the show, tour, etc. was.  We were two women traveling alone and, above all, I felt safe there.  The front door of the hotel is locked and manned.  The elevator goes only up to the 5th floor where all of the rooms are located.  The hotel is spotless.  We had an executive room which was a small bedroom area and a separate sitting area.  The room contained all of the necessities one could imagine.  The bed was very comfortable and there is a pillow menu.  Our room faced inward and was extremely…"
September 2013,Couldn't Have Been Better,"My husband and I just spent a week at Hotel 41 after a wonderful shorter stay last Fall. We travel a great deal, including many trips to London, and this is, without question, our favorite hotel. Our room was wonderful - comfortable, spotlessly clean, and with every amenity, but the service is what sets Hotel 41 apart.  Everyone we encountered made us feel as if nothing would  be too much trouble and the entire staff was friendly without being intrusive. We unexpectedly met up with some friends from home while in London, on a stormy afternoon.  We .brought them back to Hotel 41 with us (without notice to the Hotel) so we could chat in the Executive Lounge, which is a beautiful room with a fireplace, comfortable seating areas, and  a small bar area (including complimentary ice…"
October 2013,Perfect Hotel,"This is a perfect small boutique hotel in the thick of things in London. From our first conversation with Shameela to when I received the microphone in the mail in the United States from Hotel 41 which I accidentally left behind, nothing was too much for the staff of this hotel to make your stay with them as pleasurable as possible. The breakfast, the cappuccinos, the snacks, simply everything, was prepared properly and was delicious. I like the fact that they would bring some olives and snacks to your room about 4 PM to assist you in making a cocktail. If you ask for something at this hotel, they will find a way to get it for you. We stayed on the consierge floor which I highly recommend. This is a hotel that will certainly impress your significant other. Sure, it costs more…"
July 2013,Magnificent Atmosphere & Service,"This is a small hotel that occupies the 5th floor of an older building just a block away from  Buckingham Palace.  From the minute you check in, you realize that you are in for a superlative customer service experience. The staff - meticulously dressed in formal wear - attends to your every request.  Although the rooms have been very nicely remodeled and have terrific atmosphere, they are a bit unique and not appropriate for the traveler that wants a big cookie cutter room, but they are charming and really fun.  Ours was a suite on two floors, with a small sitting room in the ground floor with a fireplace, and a nice sized bedroom on the top floor.  The bathroom was large, complete with a tub that had it's own television.  The best part of the place is the guest lounge where…"
August 2013,Best hotel in London,"We booked for a 3 night ""get more from your stay package"" in July with my husband. Being in the travel industry myself this hotel offers a special experience. Not only are you offered a glass of champagne at check in, you are offered a choice of champagne . The room was spacious for London, photos do not do it justice, good quality furnishings and bedding with some special small touches which are impressive. The staff were friendly without being intrusive. Afternoon tea was excellent, I just love afternoon tea! Best steak ever in the Rubins Library restaurant. Enough said see you soon No 41"
August 2013,A Hidden Gem,"My Friend and I stayed here for a night whilst visiting London. We both needed a treat and this Hotel hit the spot. The staff are friendly and very helpful, and the rooms are stunning with every comfort. After returning from the theatre we made good use of the Pantry and shared cheeses and a glass of wine. The afternoon tea was as good as any I have had at the Ritz or The Savoy. Well done to all the team, and I will take my husband next time"
August 2013,The Hotel Staff helped to make our vacation wonderful.,"First time in London.  The staff at Hotel 41 were very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.  Had a wonderful time  The hotel was convenient to everything.  The Executive Lounge provided a perfect spot for breakfast and relaxation with a drink and snack after a day of site seeing  Overall great experience."
August 2013,The hotel to be in London,If you can spend some money in a extraordinary hotel be sure to book the Hotel 41. I have never seen suich efficient smooth and graceful service . We had a wonderful stay at this hotel which does not look as a hotel. Everything was just perfect.
August 2013,Best Boutique Hotel,"From the minute you enter the Hotel lobby until the time you checkout, you will have a wonderful experience.  The hotel is very unique, in fact it occupies the entire 5th floor of the adjacent Rubens Hotel.  It has a wonderful lounge where you can get a glass of wine, a late night snack or full service menu. The friendliness of the staff and the service they provide are unparalleled and they take care of your every request or need.  In my case they purchased for me several front of the line tickets to exhibitions in London and tickets for Billy Elliot.  I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there the next time I am in London."
August 2013,Another amazing stay at Hotel 41,"My husband and I first stayed here after our wedding last year, and had such a great experience that we promised we'd be back. And we've just been back...this time for my birthday. Hotel 41 did not disappoint. From the minute we walked in the door the service was exceptional. Room was great with lots of space and everything we needed. My husband had booked afternoon tea as a treat and it was amazing. The cakes were all designed with a celebration theme for Prince George which was lovely. I was also treated to a very unexpected birthday cake which was delicious! After going out for the evening we came back and ""plundered the pantry"" whilst drinking champagne in the lounge - incredibly relaxing place to spend time. Breakfast the following morning was excellent, as it was last time…"
August 2013,Interesting property that shake all day and late into the night,"I tried to stay here in August and had to move hotels due to the construction site across the street - the bed, hotel, everything was shaking as they drilled and dug and drilled again. It is a very interesting property - quite stylish, unique layout, and wonderfully helpful staff, but I do wonder what they are thinking when they book people in. It is not as if the construction sight is new, so why don't they warn you?  It got so bad that I had to move across town to another one of their fellow accommodations which was less than convenient. All in all, I would not recommend booking here until the construction is done - it is just not relaxing."
November 2012,Exceptional Service - Memorable Experience,"We spent 3 memorable nights at 41 last week and can say without reservation that 41 is the finest hotel in which my wife and I have had the pleasure of staying in over 30 years of travel for business and pleasure. The service was simply outstanding and without doubt the best we have ever experienced. The attention to detail and proactive approach of the staff is second to none. The hotel consists of only 28 rooms and is very cozy and warm. The Executive Lounge, with its unique atmosphere reminiscent of a mansion library, was the ideal setting in which to start our day with a great breakfast and in which to end our day with a night cap from a terrific selection of premium single malt scotch whiskies, wines, beer and spirits.  Consumption is based on the honor system and recorded…"
August 2013,Amazing!,"Hotel 41 is a fabulous place to stay. The atmosphere is beautiful, quiet, and lovey. It has delicious breakfast, perfect afternoon tea with champagne and a great night cap service with hors d'oeuvres and all; plus 24hr ice cream! I stayed here for three nights with my husband; we have two small children and would probably not stay here with them.  I think small children probably need a larger hotel with kid friendly activities/play center.  But if you want elegant pampered service, this is the place to stay.  They will pamper and cater to your every whim. This is a perfect London Hotel.  It sits across the street from Buckingham Palace, a short distance to pubs, shopping, and the tub and train stations.  Wonderful all around. I can’t wait to go back."
October 2013,An experience,"The second time that my wife and I have stayed at this hotel. Exceptional hotel, service and overall environment. Nothing is too much trouble and we will certainly stay again when we are next in London. Try the Champagne experience in the Leopards Bar - an excellent way to unwind. All of the food was cooked to a high standard and was delightful"
October 2013,Week in London,"I stayed at the hotel 41 for a week and from the minute we arrived to getting in the taxi to leave we were treated impeccably the staff were fantastic the room was excellent there was nothing I could fault and would recommend the hotel to everyone, I will definatly be staying here again the next time I'm in London"
October 2013,Nothing is too much trouble,"The service was impeccable,  the staff were delightful, the food wonderful.  I have never been to a hotel where you are actually made to feel so welcome and I've been to many many hotels around the world.  If I have anything negative to say is that the bedroom was quite small but it was beautifully presented"
October 2013,Simply Perfect,"The team at the hotel should be commended for their customer service, every little detail is catered and cared for.  Check in smooth with complimentary champagne and relaxed too, valet parking a bonus!"
September 2013,"41 is a ""10""","We just returned from a European trip that concluded with three nights at ""41"", what a great way to end a great vacation.  The hotel is conveniently located a block from Victoria Station and the only thing nicer than the surroundings is the staff.  We were checked in by Monika and treated like family.  She along with the rest of the staff are great representatives of the property and made us (excuse the pun) ""feel like royalty"".  I am looking forward to a return trip to London and I would not consider any other hotel."
September 2013,Splendid!,"After traveling & experiencing many outstanding hotels during our 15+ years of world travel we pretty much have seen it all when it comes to 5 Star service however this hotel manages to squeeze out even more in the department of personalized service.  The Concierge team has a knack of anticipating your next move and is always at your service 24/7, ready to spring into action whether it be for a restaurant reservation, Buckingham Palace Tours or general directions.  No request appears to be a challenge for this group of go-getters.    Housekeeping gets 5 gold stars in my book.  Our room was made up each day as expected but the entire room received a thorough sprucing up each day.  These are the little things that we took notice of.  The rooms are chock full of comfy-ness. …"
September 2013,Great service,"Really friendly service, comfortable room and good location.  Lots of nice little touches.  I really enjoyed the check-in in the lounge.  It's nice to have a comfy seat while checking in after a long flight.  The turn-down service was fantastic.  Would love to return!"
September 2013,Simply superb - staff are impeccable,"Hotel 41 This truly is a special hotel in London and with a great location on Buckingham Palace Road, right opposite the entrance for the  Royal Mews – a few minutes’ walk to Victoria Station, just down the road to Buckingham Palace and about seven minutes’ walk to Green Park tube (through the park) it’s a great location for the area.  Having been to London many times and stayed in numerous hotels (The Royal Gardens at Kensington and The Sofitel in St James on 3 occasions  Hotel 41 is my new favourite.  Certainly not inexpensive (even without converting to the Australian Dollar) but where else do you get seated at check in and offered complimentary ‘Verve’Champagne and have a complimentary  open pantry 24 hours a day.   The Executive lounge was our home away from home for our…"
January 2013,Home away from home in London,"First and foremost, I must commend the outstanding staff, and to call them ""staff"" almost belittles the degree to which they enhanced our stay. Everyone we encountered was friendly, competent, and eager to please. On our first full day in London, we decided to take a break from sightseeing and called the hotel to see if they could arrange an afternoon tea in the Executive Lounge. I thought this last minute request might be hard to accommodate but was greeted with ""No problem, what time would you like your tea?"".  That tea, by the way, was excellent as were all the meals we had at Hotel 41. The breakfast selection was extensive and delicious. I'd also like to note that the Hotel's Bbar restaurant (street level) was surprisingly good.  Guest rooms are nice, quiet, and well…"
October 2013,excellent,"We had a wonderful stay at the Hotel. It was on the day of my son's wedding and the hotel kindly made our rooms available early for us to change before hand. The staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly and gave us a round of applause as we left for the service.  The rooms very beautifully appointed, spotlessly clean and the bed the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Breakfast was excellent. On reaching home I realised that I had left the bridal bouquet in our room. We called the hotel and it was located, put in water and kept safe until we could return to collect it the following day. They even provided a suitable pottery container to carry the flowers in.  I would strongly recommend this hotel and hope to stay there again sometime."
September 2013,Quaint and attentive staff.,"My husband and I are just leaving the hotel after spending 3 nights in this excellent hotel.  The staff is attentive and charming.  The hotel has a old world feel to it however all the modern comforts are present in this hotel.  The hotel encompasses the essence of London, blending the old with the new.  Excellent Location."
September 2013,Just Perfect!,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 for my husbands 50th birthday. The customer service and attention to detail was superb. We were made to feel very special and the staff were just delightful. From the moment you walk in the staff are make you feel extremely welcome. Our stay exceeded my expectations and made my husbands birthday very special. If you want exceptional service, attention to detail and comfort this is the place to stay."
September 2013,"A crown jewel, next to Buckingham Place","A wonderful stay and experience at Hotel 41. It was all about superb service, attention to detail, all with exceptional amenities, in a warm, comfortable environment. As noted in other reviews, Hotel 41 is located the top floor of the Rubens Hotel, accessed by a its own entrance. It is across from Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station is one block away.  On first arrival, you are greeted in lobby, and escorted to the Lounge on the 5th floor via private Hotel 41 elevator, where you check in while offered a glass of champagne, introduced to the hotel facilities and then escorted to your room. Our room was wonderful, with a  true king bed, dark wood furniture (desk, wardrobe, table and a couple of club chairs). Did I mention the working fireplace, with remote? The bathroom was…"
November 2013,Loved. It.,Wow. Our stay at Hotel 41 came at the end of a trip where we had already experienced some excellent accommodations so our bar was set pretty high. Let's just say that Hotel 41 exceeded our expectations in so many ways. From the moment that we arrived we were made to feel special. Actually the great service started even before we arrived as I had been in contact with their concierge who were very helpful in making recommendations and arranging airport transport via email.   This hotel actually occupies the top floor of the building which also holds the Rubens Hotel. It has a separate entrance that is locked and manned making it feel very exclusive.  We had a interior facing room so no view but that may have been a blessing because the streets sound as though they may be a bit…
November 2013,Service - the best we've ever received,"We have stayed at wonderful hotels around the world but the service offered by the staff at 41 was  truly the best we have ever experienced anywhere. From the moment we made our online reservation until the moment we left, the staff left no stone unturned. Our check-in was enlivened by offers of ""Veuve Cliquot"" champagne (which we gladly accepted). There was always a complimentary snack, hors d'oeuvre, or a late-night treat available on the buffet table in the lounge. They arranged for excellent seats at the West End play, Wicked, followed by a ""Wicked"" turn-down service in our suite which had to be seen to be believed! The location of 41 (essentially next to the Queen's rear garden) made exploring the city very easy. We would think of staying no where else in London."
November 2013,Still running strong !,"I first had the chance to enjoy ""41""  when it was aq brand new additio to London Boutique Hotels scene, some 12 ( yes, 12) years ago. Since then we had been lucky enough to return in numerous occassions, but it had been a while when we went back this week. Fortunately nothing has changed the ""executive lounge"" still has no comparision within the city or beyond, the rooms ( large for London Standards) are as charming as always, and the staff ( Love the ""whenever whatever"" phone key) keeps mastering on what luxury service should be. We will back soon!"
October 2013,AMAZING!,"Hotel 41 was beautiful! Me and My boyfriend went for his birthday. Firstly the champagne reception was fantastic. Then we got a very detailed check in. We had been downgraded but they made up for it with a free bottle of champagne and free breakfast. We then got t our room and were astonished about how beautiful it was. Everything in black and white & very cosy. The bed was extremely soft and the best bed I have ever slept in! My boyfriend helped himself to the mini bar for a fee, quite expensive but well worth it! Also he made full use of the snack bar and honesty bar, which he loved! The best part was they had free haagen daas! The products in the room were divine which I made full use of having a bit of a pamper before dinner. We went out for dinner but It was very…"
October 2013,Simply the best,"My fiancé and I stayed here the night we got engaged Oct13, and what can I say other than it was worth every penny.   We were upgraded free of charge to the conservatory suite which is phenomenal, I had requested a romantic turndown which was fabulous.   And the customer service was some of the best I've experienced in any walk of life.   My only niggle is something that the hotel obviously cannot help and that's the ongoing construction work which begin very early and was a tad loud.  Other than that exceptional."
October 2013,Fantastic place!,"Hotel 41 is such a great place to stay. The always present and super friendly staff in this cozy place with its amazing interior will make you love your hotel stay in London. Food was nice and the concept of an honesty bar adds the extra trust flavour to you feeling at home.  On the scale, from 0-10, this was a clear 10 for me. I have already recommended Hotel 41 to many friends and colleagues. Will be back :-)"
October 2013,Excellent stay,"I went on a business trip to London a while back and I stayed at Hotel 41 because a friend recommended it to me, and I must say it was an excellent choice. The rooms are extremely clean, spacious and luxurious, and the bed was amazingly comfortable. The location is also great, being very near to places like Hyde Park or the Buckingham Palace, and the overall facilities here are definitely accommodating to any need you may have. I will surely stay here again the next time I`m in London, and I highly recommend it to everyone."
October 2013,Outstanding service,"We travelled to London as a couple in October for the celebration of a 50th birthday. Was fortunate to have 2 nights at the this hotel. Because this is a smaller boutique hotel, it allows it's staff to lavish attention on to the patrons. From the complementary champagne upon check in, to the ""Whatever/Whenever"" function on the phone (which we took advantage of),  the staff at the Hotel 41 were some of the most gracious and attentive we have experienced. The room was excellent, with beautiful decor, and little details such as the bedside ""Do Not Disturb"" switch were nice. By booking through the hotel web site, we were able to take advantage of additional perks such as Champagne in the room on our arrival. The added surprise of birthday cake was a welcome treat. We had a wonderful…"
November 2013,Excellent--that's all there is to say,"Well, the title says it all.    I was in London for a work trip combined with a wedding.  I was staying at the ""luxury"" Draycott.  It was not a good experience.  So I moved to Hotel 41 and I'm glad I did.    The staff were exceptional in their friendliness and standards.  The room was spotless and very well taken care off."
November 2013,If you know what you want...,"This is the perfect spot. If you want the Bellagio, with grand public spaces, huge rooms, 6 restaurants-- you'll end up being one of the 1-2 star reviews. If you want delightful service, incredibly relaxing, quiet atmosphere, great tourist location, easy breakfast and great noshing in the evening-- this is the spot. I put 4 stars here just because I can see how someone looking for a glamorous 5 star show would be disappointed. But if you're looking for small ( and it helps to be small-- beds/chairs are all compact) quiet elegance that feels like a hideaway from the real world-- this will work very nicely. Smashing!"
December 2013,wow. amazing! its like home only better!,"this is a tucked away small (28 room) luxury hotel located near buckingham palace. for me it was convenient to anywhere.  i flew overnight to london and got to the hotel at 8 am. my room was ready! they knew my name (and i hadn't stayed there before) they brought me fresh piping hot coffee, and then took me to where i could get (free) continental breakfast!  my room was a bit small...okay for me, but for two people it probably would've been too tight. great linens, great amenities, nice tv, decent view.  the beauty of this hotel is how well one is treated. at the end of the day i went to the executive lounge, which is the heart of the hotel. they made me drinks, brought me canapé, helped me get dinner reservations, and were so friendly i felt like i knew them for a long time. …"
April 2013,Excellence in every respect!,"5 star boutique hotel. Extremely friendly staff. Incredibly nice people! They seem to know your name before you introduce yourself to the concierge. Nice and comfortable rooms, cozy living room for breakfast, snacks and drinks. You feel at home."
May 2013,I need to come back!,"This is most definitely my favourite hotel in London. The staff could not do enough for you, the rooms were a great size and the lounge made the hotel have that special touch.   The hotel itself is a joy to just roam around and enjoy the hotel setting, particularly a glass of champagne in front of the fire.   The prices for the rooms seem extremely reasonable in comparison to other 5* hotels on offer in the area we have stayed at.  The only downside was our shower did leak slightly, however we did not complain as it was not that much of a concern at the time! Definitely not enough to make us have a negative thought of this exceptional hotel.  I look forward to my return."
November 2013,the best hotel in london,"For us was an incredible experience!! the hotel is so british and we love that!! the suite perfect to celebrate our wedding aniversary.  Para nosotros una experiencia increible!! el hotel es muy ""British"" pero nos encanta ese estilo!! la suite perfecta para celebrar nuestro aniversario de bodas."
September 2013,Fabulous Hotel,"Staff are all exceptionally helpful friendly and professional in looking after their guests.  Facilities are excellent as you would expect.  Nice little touches - a special little birthday cake was left in room without asking or prompting,  and helped mske the day extra nice for my wife."
September 2013,Exceptional Service and Attention to Detail,"On company business we stayed one night at Hotel 41.   From the moment you walk in you are looked after by amazing staff. We were made to feel extremely welcome, had a wonderful room, the extras in the room were most appreciated, the bathroom was luxurious and the bed extremely comfortable. Although we did not make use of the 24 hour buffet it look wonderful as did the honesty bar. The cooked breakfast in the morning was delicious. We left wishing we could stay longer and would have no hesitation in recommending it to friends."
September 2013,"Small, intimate and very special","Hotel 41 is actually the fifth floor of the Rubens Hotel building, accessed by a separate entrance. It is characterized by an exceptional level of service and attention to detail from the staff. My company was conducting business in London and the board room at 41 was ideal. Throughout my three days there I was treated like a special guest and in a genuinely friendly manner. My room was especially well-equipped - the bathroom was large and the king-sized bed very comfortable - and little touches like a fruit hamper were much appreciated. Everything about the place is five-star and I found no fault. As a Yorkshireman I never imagined I could consider $600 a night for a hotel to be good value, but for this quality of experience I do think so and wouldn't hesitate in recommending…"
October 2012,Oasis with great service,"We stayed at Hotel 41 last Tuesday night to be near to Victoria Station.  It literally took my breath away.  Secreted on 5th floor (formally the ballroom) of the Rubens hotel, 41 is so special and true luxury.  Yes you do pay for it, however you certainly get the service and quality you would expect - and some.  The staff are so friendly, helpful and efficient and the decor throughout is amazing.  Definitely will be saving up to go back again.  Fabulous place for couples to celebrate a special occasion."
July 2013,Best Hotel in London,"We had the pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for our final night in London during the Olympics.  We had rented a flat for the previous 2 weeks and treated ourselves on our last night at Hotel 41 to celebrate our anniversary.  The hotel was an oasis in a central and hectic part of London.  The room was spacious and beautiful, but what really stood out were the staff and the level of service.  They truly provided a memorable ending to a great experience in London.  Next time, we plan on staying for more than one night!"
September 2013,Honeymoon night - could not have picked a better hotel!,My son and I spent a lovely week at Hotel 41 in July.  We felt that Hotel 41 was our home and oasis during our visit to London.  The staff's attention to detail and to the needs of each guest are beyond excellent.  I am a seasoned traveler and can say that I have never experienced the level of personal attention and care that we received at Hotel 41.  The staff is simply the best.  The rooms are well appointed and spacious by London standards.   This hotel is truly a gem and from now on the only place I will stay in London.  I stongly recommend Hotel 41.
August 2013,Return trip,"We LOVED Hotel 41! It's very boutique, right on Buckingham Palace Rd. It feels like there are only 5 rooms even though there are 30. The attention to detail of the staff was amazing! We had rose petals strewn on the bed and around the bath, candles lit and a fire! The gorgeous lounge with free delicious nibbles and drinks is divine.  The continental breakfast offering was beyond expectations - in fact that just sums up the whole place. Incredible. And I stay in a LOT of 5 star places.... I wish we could have stayed longer - and eaten some of the food that is written about in the lovely recipe book. Charming, completely customer focused personal care and service - nothing is too much trouble. Well worth it.  We just can't fault it and are saving to come back next time!"
September 2013,Birthday treat,"I was lucky enough to return to 41 For my birthday after staying in June. It was better then I remembered and we had a fab time. The staff are all lovely, the food is very good and although not as central as some I really like the location, there is always something going on around the palace. I for one can't wait to go back, a lovely oasis in London! "
November 2013,Top notch everytime,"Had another excellent stay here this time to celebrate Mummy and Daddy's anniversary, service is nothing short of servitude (in a nice way of course). Breakfast and afternoon tea to die for. Perhaps we should move in."
December 2012,Royal treatment!!!,"I dont think you can stay @ a hotel any closer to the palace & get the same treatment as if you were staying AT the palace!!!! From the moment you are greeted @ the front door to leaving after your stay- its 1st class all the way. We are fortunate enough to have had this last quick stay be our 4th time to the 41 & we honestly cant think of another place in London that we would want to try out- well other than the palace- if we were invited...... The top notch, professional staff @ Hotel 41 really make the difference & genuinely go out of their way to make you feel as comfortable as royalty. This time we stayed in one of their 2 story suites & it was beautiful. The living area on the entrance level was compact but served its purpose- there was also a fireplace the living room…"
November 2013,The best in London,"My favorite place to stay in London.  Worth traveling to the UK just to stay here. The afternoon teas are lovely and breakfast is great.  Very close to Victoria Station.  Great central location...................""........."
November 2013,Distinctly upper class,"There are so many things that make Hotel 41 special but one of them is the friendliness of the staff; they know who you are and address you by your name. All the personnel are genuinely interested in your plans and ask about how the day went when you return to the hotel later in the day.    When we booked in we were welcomed in the reception lounge with the customary glass of champagne – how civilised – and, being in no particular rush, finished it sitting on leather sofas by the fire where, unbidden, refills and canapés appeared. We were then escorted to our room. It was beautifully equipped and contained every extra you could possibly wish for. The toiletries are Penhaligons, the bathrobes are pure bliss (I searched online but unfortunately they are only available in USA), the…"
November 2013,The best hotel in London,"Hotel 41 is not as grand in appearance as some of the other hotels in London, however, the service is the best I have ever experienced. The executive lounge is a fantastic place to relax and the staff are excellent and can not do enough for you."
August 2013,Excellent,"Hotel 41 was beautiful! Me and My boyfriend went for our anniversary. The champagne reception was fantastic. The people were wonderful. I can't wait to come back! I first had the chance to enjoy it when it was aq brand new additio to London Boutique Hotels scene, some twelve years ago. Since then we had been lucky enough to return in numerous occassions, but it had been a while when we went back this week."
August 2013,Simply Outstanding!,"Well... I don't really know where to start to be honest!  Outstanding, Exceeded guests expectations, Amazing experience, 100% Guest satisfaction are all things that come to mind when trying to sum up my stay at Hotel41 London.  I stayed here a total of 5 nights / 6 days with Family (My Mum) and right from the time I was greeted at the main door on a Saturday night at 11:15pm to the time I left the same main door it was like a home away from home.  No matter what the query (small, large or insignificant) ALL the staff went above and beyond to help in any way they could which as a guest makes it just that much more reassuring and helps in enjoying the holiday!  In my profession customer service is absolutely crucial and Hotel41 showed exactly how it's done on all levels. Having…"
November 2012,"Like a catered, private flat","Where to start? You know how at most hotels there is usually one, maybe two people who run around and really have the ability to sort out whatever need or problem you have? Imagine a small luxury hotel with a battalion of people with that kind of star treatment attitude and authority. At the same time, the personal touch was never overbearing -- just enough to make sure we made full use of the hotel. Service is without a doubt outstanding.  The hotel itself is laid out like an eccentric rabbit warren of corridors -- you will find this either endearing or annoying. We found it endearing, and had an informal competition to see who could first find a route to the private elevator without recourse to going through the lounge.   The lounge itself is really the only common area of…"
August 2013,Perfect start to our marriage!,"My husband and I stayed here on our wedding night and the following night, before flying off on the rest of our honeymoon and even for a fussy bride this hotel excelled expectations! We opted for the romantic turn down and couldn't believe how nice the room was!   Staff - All staff went out of their way to provide a friendly and unobtrusive service, providing champagne on arrival and quickly showing us to our room. In addition to the usual service, one person went out of her way to find me a dress bag for my wedding dress and they also held onto some of our luggage for several weeks, which we decided not to take on honeymoon (all for no extra charge).    Food - The plunder the pantry option was fantastic, with plenty of choice. All food was of an excellent quality and the…"
August 2013,A wonderful boutique hotel,"I'm a Londoner who now lives in Los Angeles. I've travelled all over the US and Europe but go back to London every year. This is now my absolute first choice to stay because of the most amazing staff. I've read some of the negative reports - these people would obviously be much happier on Park Lane with the accompanying ostentation or perhaps they should simply stay at home. But if you want to feel that you are in London and you want a great location with the best service imaginable, you should stay here. The rooms are small by Park Lane standards but really comfortable and breakfast is a social event. We will be back!!"
August 2013,A wonderful hidden gem!!,Took my wife to London for a surprise weekend. Hotel was fabulous!! Its location near to Buckingham Palace was excellent and only a short walk to Victoria Tube Station providing easy access to London's attractions. Hotel interior was refine and in keeping with the portrayed image. We have stayed in many 5* Hotels but at Hotel 41 the staff were amazing and went that extra mile. I think this is because the hotel feels like the executive apartments of the Rubens Hotel and therefore has a smaller number of rooms which enables the management and staff to provide a wonderful customer experience. Thank you to all the staff who made our stay very special and we look forward to returning.
July 2013,The best service anywhere.,"Just returned from our 2nd trip in recent months to 41, and already can't wait to go back! If attentive service and being made to feel special every minute of your stay is what you are looking for then this is the place to stay. We have stayed at many good hotels with good service but the staff here are on the next level. The staff are genuine, caring, helpful and interested in making your stay the best it can be. Thank you all at Hotel 41!"
July 2013,ABSOLUTELY THE BEST CUSTOMER APPRECIATION!,My 14 year old granddaughter Elana and I recently returned from our trip of a lifetime to London and Paris. I choose Hotel 41 because I wanted to give her a special and unique experience and it was worth every single penny! She will remember the staff of Hotel 41 for the rest of her life....so wonderfully gifted in making you feel like you're the only ones staying there! We stayed for 5 nights and wished we could have stayed longer. The room was luxurious and delightful - every day they brought fresh fruit to the room. I can't say enough about the little amenities that the staff provided. Breakfast buffet was perfect (of course our waiter Stefan certainly had a part in making it that way with his delightful stories).  High tea was marvelous! Perfect location! Perfect hotel! I…
August 2013,Amazing Hotel!,"Without a doubt, this is one of the finest hotels in London.  My wife and I enjoyed our stay here immensely!  It is conveniently located within 5 minutes walking of Victoria station and Buckingham Palace.  The hotel facilities are superb and our bed was really comfortable.  Choices of nuts, fruit, and ice cream were complimentary and available all day.  Breakfast was great also.  The hotel staff were the ones that really make this hotel superb.  From check-in to check-out every hotel staff member treated us kindly and asked if they could be of assistance.  We will definitely return to Hotel 41 on our London trips."
November 2012,Best hotel experience of my life!,"My husband and I travelled to London as part of an extended European vacation for our honeymoon.  Without a doubt, our stay in Hotel 41 was the best of our trip and the best hotel we have ever stayed in.  Service is absolutely exceptional (they kept iced glasses and iced vodka for my late night martini, printed directions with a map for a cabbie to take us out to dinner, set up rose petals and candles in a heart shape in our room, arranged airport travel back to Heathrow with a driver, and I could go on and on here...).  I think I hugged our concierge, Monika, the day we departed because I was going to miss her! Stefan offered great travel advice every day and made us laugh every morning! The room itself was exceptional also.  We had a conservatory suite with a retractable roof…"
August 2013,Simply Amazing,"My wife and I visited together and both agreed that this is truly a lovely hotel with wonderful staff. Our entire experience greatly exceeded our expectations.  Our delightful driver Colin took us on a little mini-tour before dropping us at the hotel, helping us to get our bearings. our lovely upgraded room was ready for us upon arrival.  The entire Milestone staff was first-rate: Our room was always beautifully clean, we were greeted by name by the reception staff and doormen, all doing their best to make our stay a memorable one.Staff were very knowledgeable, helping us immensely with theatre tickets, dinner reservations, private tours, directions and advice on how to use the tube. No request was too great for them.  I am busy thinking up excuses to make another trip to…"
July 2013,Wow - what a hotel! Definitely going back....,"I chose this hotel based on the reviews on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed!  On arrival we were offered a glass of champagne....but not any champagne, you get a choice of 4-5 different champagnes! A great start to our wedding anniversary.  The staff are so friendly and welcoming, nothing is too much trouble. The room was lovely and we had been left a small chocolate cake with happy anniversary on it - a small but well noted touch.  Throughout our stay it was evident that they know you by name, no signing after having drinks or anything like that, the staff no exactly who you are without having to ask - finally a hotel where you are a person not a room number!  We had the romantic turndown service and it was amazing, candles, rose petals and champagne - a great end to a…"
July 2013,Exceeded our already high expections!,"We visited the hotel for our wedding anniversary and were blown away by every aspect of the stay. Every member of staff knows your name and makes you feel special. We arrived home from the theatre to find our room filled with candles, rose petals and chocolate cake. At breakfast we were given a teddy bear to take home to our 2 year old son, we must have mentioned him once in passing and they remembered about him and gave us a little gift for him. That sums the place up, it's got everything you'd expect from 5 star but all the little things they do is what makes it special. We will be back! "
September 2012,Amazing,"Ill start by stating we are very fussy travelers and this hotel exceeded our expectations. We found 41 on tripadvisor and was also recommended by a friend. We stayed at 41 for 3 nights from the 15 July and it was not enough. This boutique hotel had every detail covered. The staff were fantastic and made us feel so welcome. The rooms were very nice, clean and every little detail had been thought of. We traveled with our 2 children and the hotel and staff catered for all of there needs, from slippers, miniature dressing gowns and most important ice cream on tap! The food was divine.  The staff offered amazing recommendations for food, places of interest and shopping. My family and I look forward to returning again in the near future. Hotel 41 thanks again!!!!"
June 2013,Great service and private club ambiance,"I stayed several times at ""41"" and I like the fact that is almost a little ""secret"". Situated on a high floor in the same building of the Rubens Hotel t5he ""41"" has the feeling of a private club. The concierge service is one of the best I have experienced in London, the staff is really helpful and knowledgeable. The breakfast and tea services are terrific and I love the idea of the pantry in the library always ready for a drink or a snack even in the middle of the night. The rooms are pretty if a bit small and the location is great for sightseeing,k a little less for shopping however the Victoria tube is very close and so is the station with the train that comes in right from Gatwick airport."
July 2013,41: the best,I have been many times in the 41 - and there is a reason for this: the 41 provides that kind of service that is only achieved by professionals who are competent and love their job. Service is impeccable and allow me to relax after a hard day's work with sometimes 8 - 10 meetings with various business partners. The staff's attention to detail always surprises me - and I am a hard taskmaster - almost never giving a perfect score - but the 41 comes as close as I can think of: 9.99 out of 10   :-)
May 2013,One of the best hotels in which I have stayed!!,"I have done extensive business and personal travel internationally, and have a high standard as I was - for a while - a senior executive in the hospitality industry.  So, when I indicate Hotel 41 is one of the best, it is against a very high standard.  My wife and I were in London for a wedding, and chose Hotel 41 based on the many positive reviews.  I have also stayed, on a previous trip, at Milestone - and in the case of both properties have been impressed by Red Carnation Hotels.  The things I liked were numerous, but heavily focused on the impressive team assembled at Hotel 41.  Stay learned our names and our likes/dislikes quickly, and were responsive to our wishes almost as if they read minds.  The service was better than any Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton in which I have…"
June 2013,Wonderful hotel with wonderful ambiance,"Lovely weekend stay , check in experience was exceptional (especially if you like Champagne). Service and atmosphere outstanding though room (junior suite) bit cramped .  Also excellent central location."
July 2013,Feels like a private club,"I traveling frequently to London on business and have stayed at many hotels, but I always go back to the 41 for several reasons. Small, luxurious, private hotel which feels like a private club. Responsive staff who go the extra mile to know you and your needs. Comfortable, well appointed rooms with in-room computer system. No need to bring your laptop. I can check my e-mail, surf the internet, work on documents, print or fax them--all from my bed. THe lounge is inviting and well stocked with drinks, snacks, sandwiches, fruits etc. Before going to my room at the end of the day, I always stop in the lounge for a drink. The one minor drawback is the 41 is not conducive for meetings. They do have a state-of-the-art meeting room for guests to use, but there really isn't come meet me…"
June 2013,Kim and Paul at 41,We chose this hotel as it had a very good rating with Trip Advisor and were not disappointed.  The hotel is located in a very good area for getting around central London and the service the staff provided was second to none.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone and we will definitely be staying there on our return trips to London.
July 2013,Excellent Experience at Hotel 41 in London,"My husband and I wanted to make sure that this hotel was recognized for its outstanding service and accommodations. There was literally nothing they would not try to do for us. We especially like the button on the phone that said 'anything, anytime' and that is exactly what they meant!  Would recommend this hotel to anyone, anytime !"
July 2013,"Staff are 1st class - real gems - and beds, what more can you say...","Stayed here over the weekend as part of our visit for the London 2012 Anniversary race at the Olympic Stadium. The hotel is situated a very short walk from Victoria tube station and right across the road from the Mews at Buckingham Palace. As we entered my daughter said it’s a bit like Alice in Wonderland inside, it is truly magical.  As you can see from my profile we stay in hotels across the world, and I have been fortunate to stay in some great places, but this one from a staff perspective is the best, really interested in you, very well trained, ready smile, helpful, endearing, you could go on. Well done everyone from the cleaning staff upwards.  Upon arrival you are offered a complimentary glass of chilled champagne, and it is chilled, whilst you check in, and there are…"
June 2013,Do not regret not staying here !!,"Wow wow wow !! Got told about this hotel and it was even better in person , all the previous reviews I had read are absolutely spot on , all staff are exceptionally sincere , professional and take pride in their workplace. Comfortable , clean and yet again a perfect central location - only wish I had stayed here my whole trip !! Will be back for sure and can't recommend highly enough "
July 2013,Great boutique hotel with fabulous service,"Believe the other reviews, on TA, the hotel is ideally situated right across from the Royal Mews and easy access to all of London.  But what really makes it great is the incredible staff and the service they provide.  Lauren and the rest of the staff are true gems, engaging in genuine conversation with the guests in the luxurious common room  and going out of their way to make our stay memorable.  I've been to London a few times but  this was the best ever thanks to the staff at Hotel 41.  Hats off to all of you."
July 2013,An Exquisite Charm,"We only stayed in London two nights, once on our travels to Paris and once on the way back home - had I known how lovely our stay would be at Hotel 41 I would have made arrangements to stay longer! The service was impeccable, the lodging and appointments uniquely British and extremely 5 star quality.  Malcolm arranged every detail of our stay, Stefan and the front desk staff welcomed us with champagne and Monica followed up to confirm that every aspect was perfect. I would thoroughly recommend this little charm to anyone visiting London for a first time or for the seasoned traveler looking for a lovely British property!"
July 2013,Exceptional service to make you feel at home,"You feel welcome from the moment you walk through the door. As a business traveller, lots of little things help ease work stress.  These include the lounge which has complimentary, excellent quality food always available, canapes daily from 18.00  and a community fridge with bottles of water you are welcome to take on your way out. The tables in the lounge are spaced so you have privacy, where you can work somewhere other than your room.  I was there until 1am a couple of nights and someone periodically offered a hot drink.  All the staff based in the  lounge were thoughtful and offered exceptional service. Our room had a good sized desk and a stationary draw with items such as scissors, sticky tape, paper clips - handy.  And free WiFi throughout - a condition of any hotel I…"
June 2013,outstanding,"This is opulent old school style, great room and facilities excellent service so many complimentary items like ice cream in hot weather not cheap but great value. This would be a very difficult place to fault beautiful setting just wonderful."
July 2013,Just about perfect... and there ain't no such thing as perfect!,"A combination of business and pleasure brought my party to London. I booked two rooms. From check-in to check-out the staff was, indeed, perfect. Invariably, on a seven-day stay, situation, requests, issues come up. The staff dealt with every one, solved every problems, secured every dinner reservation, arranged every transport, fulfilled every request with aplomb and courtesy and sincere ""at-your-service"" attitude. Stefan Otto and ALL of the floor staff, from reception to servers to doormen to maids... just unfailing service with a charming smile.  The facility is charming, polished and spotlessly clean... maybe the coolest boutique hotel setting in the West (Upper House in Hong Kong still gets best-boutique-hotel-in-the-world in my book). I loved the small size and warren of…"
June 2013,"Treated like royalty, wonderful service, cool a/c","We stayed three nights at Hotel 41. Upon arrival we were greeted with two glasses of Champagne. We were actually given our choice of preferred Champagne. Service and checkin were flawless. It is hard to describe the ambiance at 41. We enjoyed the executive lounge with snacks, fresh bread, drinks available at all times. The hallways and rooms are very European with low ceilings, many mirrors, wood, nicely decorated. Very quaint. We enjoyed our conversations with Stefan Otto and our bellman Brogdan was very attentive and helpful. All the staff was wonderful. The only flaw of our stay was some problems with the main elevator. Normally this would have been a major issue, but the attentiveness of the staff and the accommodations made up for this big time. It is very easy to miss…"
May 2013,We were made to feel like we were Royalty!,"If you aren’t careful, you may just miss this sweet little Gem of a Boutique Hotel, placed in a superb location ~ right across the street from the Queen’s ‘Mews’ (where Queen Lizzie stores her Royal Coaches, Bentleys, Rolls, and such.) When you drive up to 41 Buckingham Palace Rd, the more prominent façade of the sister ‘Red Carnation’ Hotel, ‘The Rubens’, sits immediately next door to the entrance of ‘Hotel 41’. Hotel 41 actually occupies the 5th floor of what used to be the Rubens Hotel Ball Room, but now holds 30 beautifully appointed rooms of this very special and classically British residence.  When my wife and I arrived at the 41, we were escorted to a stylish elevator lift, which took us to the reception desk located in the Executive Lounge on the 5th floor. We were…"
May 2013,Wonderful stay -- helpful staff,"We are already planning our next stay at Hotel 41.  From the moment we arrived after our overnight flight from the US, the staff was perfect.  From arranging for us to have a ""temporary"" room until our room was cleaned to offering us breakfast (we slept through the United Airline breakfast) -- our first day in London started much better than anticipated.    The team was always willing to make restaurant suggestions (which were great) and helpful hints on things to see.  Our favorite part of the day was heading back ""home"" for tea and biscuits.    We reserved an Executive King, which was bigger than we had expected.  Next time, we plan to upgrade to the suite.  After our stay, Hotel 41 is now in my wife's top 3 hotels in the world."
April 2013,impeccable service,"In the shadows of Buckingham Palace, Hotel 41 is a little oasis of charm with outstanding service from the excellent staff. Although a small hotel, the welcome and attention to detail was simply first class. Our family room was well appointed and had many little luxuries, like free bottles of still and sparkling water, chocolates and toffees, and even free tubs of ice cream for the children, which was a massive hit with them! Only yards from both victoria station, the big bus site seeing tour and buckingham palace, it is a fantastic venue to explore central london. We strolled up the Mall to Trafalgar Square, and enjoyed some walks through St James Park and Green Park, which are both minutes from the hotel. The executive lounge was lavishly appointed and the breakfast's were…"
April 2013,Best of the Best!  We Miss Hotel 41!,"There are not enough words to describe how wonderful Hotel 41 is.  We stayed for 7 nights, and would have loved to stay more!  The staff are amazing!  Everyone is extremely friendly, and they are very eager to help make your stay comfortable and memorable.  I really cannot say enough about the friendliness of the staff.  They were always asking where we were going for the day and if there was anything we needed for our day out (there is bottled water, coffee, treats, and umbrellas at the front door of the hotel).  When we returned, they asked all about our day.  We were always greeted with a smile and kind words.  This is truly a genuinely great group of people!      The location is fantastic.  We were able to walk anywhere we wanted to go.  All of the major sights of London are…"
January 2013,Royal treatment next door to Buckingham Palace,"The charm of this 29 room hotel is set from the moment the door is opened and you are escorted to the check-in/reception on the 5th floor.  The staff is attentive, respectful and available to assist, as needed.  The room was bright, well appointed and housekeeping as attentive with impeccably cleaned rooms and they also employ ""green initiatives"" in reference to linen changes.  It has a great location with easy access to all we needed in London and we will return again and again.  Their food and beverage service is well planned and executed and will tailor to your needs.  If you travel to London, do not overlook this gem.  You will be happy you didn't!"
April 2013,A Secret Gem - Hotel 41,Old World Charm complimented by courteous service makes Hotel 41 one of the best hotels I've visited. Every staff member is helpful and whatever you need they will fulfill that comfort. Amenities are 5-star.
April 2013,Fabulous.,"We were in London for the Marathon and Hotel 41 made our stay unforgettable. They were very attentive in all aspects. The staff signed a card to cheer my husband on before the event. After they had a bouquet of roses in our room. They all took an interest in how he had done. The service was really the best we've had at a hotel. The rooms were well appointed, the bathroom had a separate shower & bathtub wt shower. Good water pressure! Turndown service too. The lounge was beautiful and they provided many complimentary snacks all day, scones, in he evening the pantry was stocked wt cheeses, breads, meats, ice cream and desserts. It was very appreciated and great quality. What we had off the menu was very good too. Location was very handy with the tube just a 2 minute walk away and…"
April 2013,A Thing of Beauty...,"Hotel 41 can best be described as the secret, luxury, top floor of the Reuben’s Hotel - the lift only goes from ground to fifth floor. We chose it for its proximity to the London Marathon finish and, boy, are we glad we did. Service is 5 star in that lovely 'you don’t know they are there' way; demeanour is chatty, almost gossipy, again in a good way. When they found out my girlfriend was running the marathon, a good luck card appeared signed by all the girls (I never saw any male staff during our 4 day stay). On finishing the race she found a 'congratulations' cake in the room and when we returned to it late that night rose petals and candles were everywhere. Unexpected, lovely, little flourishes cooked up, I have no doubt, by the girls themselves. This is the most romantic…"
April 2013,I won't stay anywhere else!,"My BFF and I stayed here for her birthday.  Thank you to Lauren, Laura and especially Remus!  The service was exceptional!  We loved the ability to plunder the pantry and sharing our adventure with the staff.  Overall everyone was helpful, charming and catered to all our needs."
May 2012,"A Perfect P,ace To Stay","My husband and and I just spent a few days in London and we were very impressed by not only the amazing location of Hotel 41, but also with the comfort of the bed, the amenities offered and the most courteous and helpful staff you can imagine.  There was not one thing that we asked for that we did not receive immediately and with a smile on their faces.  The rooms are not huge, but that was not something either of us felt bothered us, we would recommend Hotel 41 to anyone who would like to go to London...it was great!"
April 2013,Excellent Stay,We had an excellent stay at the Hotel 41. We were there the previous year and loved the hotel so much we came back. This time was perfect too. Monica made our stay perfect both times from start to finish. I had requested dinner reservations prior to our stay and she took care of everything.
May 2013,Romance all the way,"My partner and I spent two night last week end at 41 and I booked the romantic package. It was amazing all the way. We had a duplex suite where each can have some privacy. I recommend this choice since the regular rooms are a bit small and sitting in front of the fireplace, drinking a glass of Champagne was part of the pleasure.   The staff did not spare any efforts to make us feel home and all was done in a very professional and attentive way. Their advice for restaurants at night was very much what we were looking for.  In summary, a very memorable stay and we will definitively be back"
September 2012,Hotel 41 Staff is Extraordinary!,"Great location, lovely boutique, great location and the real guest winner is an extraordinary staff who makes each guest feel like they are at home with a full and happy service staff.  Impressive crew. Congratulations Hotel 41 staff!"
May 2013,Service service service,"Spent our last two nights here before flying home to Australia, and wow what an experience, we felt like royalty. We arrived to be greeted by the doormen who arranged to park the car. We were then taken upstairs to the check in lounge, wow, choice of 4 kinds of champagne's while we checked in. Then we were shown to our rooms first being our other travel companions, their room was huge with fireplace, huge bed, huge bath, separate shower. Then we were shown to our room, well it was tiny, had to shimmy round the bed, it felt quite claustrophobic in comparison. We complained to staff as we'd paid the same price we'd expected the same as theirs. They said they'd see what they could do, we went for a walk out and on arriving back was given a new room, wow that was much better. The…"
May 2013,Best hotel experience ever,"If it was possible to give a 10 star rating, I would.  I first heard of this hotel on Trip Advisor and decided to give it a try, and am very glad I did.  From the moment we arrived, the staff went out of their way to make us feel at home, and for 8 days, when going back to the hotel, we did refer to it as ""going home.""  As mentioned in other reviews, the rooms are nice and very comfortable.  The turn down service, with the rose petals and lit candles, was unlike any we've ever seen. The Executive Lounge, which is really the only public space in the hotel, served as the reception area, dining area, bar, and general gathering spot.  The staff quickly got to know our likes, dislikes, and my many quirks. Speaking of the staff, they are what make this place stand out among other fine…"
May 2013,Splendid!,"I have opportunity to stay at many top chain hotels for business trips, the Ritz Carlton, Shangri-la,  Splendid etc., but for vacation, I always prefer a boutique hotel.   Hotel 41 in London is a perfect match for what I want in a large cosmo city.  Close, walking distance to all major attractions, including museums, the Buckingham Palace, Victoria train station and of course, no vacation is complete without a good session of retail therapy.  Harrod's is only 15-20 minutes walk from the hotel (or 6-7 pounds by taxi).  Our flight arrived early in the morning.  We waited about an hour while the room being prepared and the hotel staff checked us in early, before noon.  No problem.    Breakfasts are superb!  Begium waffles are a MUST have.  Eggs Royal are stacked up high with smoked…"
December 2012,"Relaxed, luxurious stay","My wife and I just spent 9 days at 41 on an extended pleasure trip to London. Room was great-quiet (upholstered walls in hall keep noise to a minimum); lovely linens,room was large and  immaculately cleaned and refreshed twice a day. Every detail addressed right down to heated floor in bath.  But what puts 41 over the top is uniformly cheerful, friendly staff. Knew us by name in 2 hours, new our preferences for food, drink and activities by Day 2.  More like staying at a small, private club than a hotel. Definitely a personal twist on the 5 star experience."
May 2013,WoW what a hotel,"My girlfriend took me here in December for a birthday treat what an experience it was as soon as we pulled up we had our car door opened shown in with our bags taken from us then led to the lobby were we was offered different types of champagne. We was shown around the lobby were you can help yourself to the Hagen Daz ice cream, spirits, and different food or you can just chill out by the fire when we went to our room which was upgraded to a split level room I had a nice birthday card waiting for me with some little chocolate treats from the staff which was lovely. The room was so nice and spotless you even had a pillow menu with over ten different pillow types to help you sleep I thought was a nice touch. The beds are a good size with quality clean bedding and pillows real…"
May 2013,Overpriced and noisy,"I stayed at the 41 recently after seeing some good reviews here. I don't know what these people are thinking. The room was tiny. There is no lobby, you use a key card or someone has to buzz you in then you take the elevator to the 5th floor which is where everything is. Rooms, front desk, restaurant, etc. People hover all over you. I had a bowl of cereal for breakfast and the charge was £20. I was woken up at least 5 times each night as you can hear literally every noise and person walking by in the hallway. I thought I was getting a luxury hotel and instead got an overpriced crappy room with generally nice people who hover over you constantly eliminating all privacy."
May 2013,Fantastic Relaxing Break - Great Service,"This is the second time I have stayed at Hotel 41 in the last year and having enjoyed both visits immensely I am compelled to write a review.  The staff were extremely welcoming and upon checking in we were treated to some champagne and spent a good few hours relaxing in the executive lounge. The set up in the lounge is great with a large supply of complimentary snacks as well an extremely well stocked bar. The service was excellent and my wife and I were particularly well entertained by a charming South African gentleman who had the perfect balance of good service and amusing banter. The other staff were also excellent, in particular the Resident Manager who looked after us very well. If good service is your thing then Hotel 41 is the place to go....and I have not even got onto…"
May 2013,Outstanding service,Hotel 41 may have the best service that I have encountered at any hotel. Certainly the best outside of the Far East. As well it combines great service with an atmosphere that is not stuffy or formal. The rooms are not grand but certainly adequate.
June 2013,"""Disgraceful!""","Now I have grabbed your attention, the title of my review refers to all hotels I have stayed at previousley (excluding all red carnation group hotels, lily beach Maldives and sensortori Tenerife) as they really need to spend some time in this hotels company, to see how its really done! Like others have said before me regarding this hotel, there really is not much i can add to tell people how exceptionally good this hotel is. From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel so welcome, and nothing was a problem. We absolutley loved the whatever, whenever button on the phone, but this was truly the tip of the ice berg in terms of what this amazing hotel offers its guests. Special thanks go to Remus for his help with an issue at helen darozze (Remus: we have been offered a VIP…"
December 2012,Charming small hotel with great location,"My wife and I were on our 30th anniversary vacation. I found this hotel online and it had wonderful reviews. They were well deserved. The staff is attentive and professional. The central lobby/restaurant/lounge is staffed 24/7. There are very nice complimentary foods and beverages available all the time. At 2 am, the staff was able to solve a power adapter problem easily. They also pay attention to detail. We came into our very nice room one night to find candles and rose petals - so nice for a romantic honeymoon trip. They even had an anniversary cake and candle for us in the room one night. All in all a wonderfully attentive and romantic hotel. Even the location across from Buckingham palace was great. The great topper was the price of the hotel was lower than any of its…"
May 2013,What a hotel - breathtaking!,"We stayed for a Christmas break - the third time we'd been to this hotel. It is a luxurious and indulgent experience from beginning to end. Spacious and stylish rooms, comfortable beds, large baths, fluffy towels and gowns, great food - what's not to like??  The staff are always on hand if needed and unfailingly helpful - nothing is too much trouble. Location is decent - fairly central and a short stroll from Victoria Station and the parks.  We'd asked for something 'Christmassy' when booking at were delighted to find mini mince pies, christmas chocs and crackers in our room. Little details and the personal touch make such a difference. They keep your preferences on file so you'll find your favourite drinks waiting for you on arrival."
June 2013,"Wonderful, exceptional hotel","We stayed here for our honeymoon and had an absolutely fantastic time. We were greeted with a lovely room decorated with roses and some petit fours, which was very much appreciated. The room itself was very cute, though I must admit it was a bit cramped for the price. The hotel itself is lovely, occupying a single floor atop another, slightly lesser quality sister hotel. Hotel 41 also has a very nice library where you take tea as well as delicious food and snacks.   One thing that really struck us was how friendly the staff at 41 was. Every single staff member learned our names within the first day and many of them had long conversations with us during tea and such. It was an absolute pleasure and really gave the hotel a very warm feeling. It was absolutely perfect for a…"
June 2013,Simply the Best,"I stayed at the hotel for one night on 16/06/13 as a ""treat"" for my partners birthday. I chose it for the simple fact it was (at the time) rated No.1 on Tripadvisor.   It is, without doubt, the BEST hotel I have ever stayed at. The place oozes quality the minute you walk through the door. The staff are just the best - on arrival our bags were taken to the room - and we were offered (and gratefully accepted) not one, but two glasses of champagne during check in. This included a brief talk advising us of the amenities in the Executive Lounge (the main reception and dining room) which included free snacks and soft drinks (the ""snacks"" included smoked salmon, an array of superb cheeses, fruit etc). There was even a freezer full of Hagen-Daz ice-cream.  The room was, like everything…"
June 2013,London visit,"This is and outstanding Hotel and terrific staff went out of their way to take care of my wife and I great location very nice rooms the library was great place to hang out and had access to a  computer would highly recommended to everyone Phil g Indianapolis, Indiana"
May 2013,Lovely hotel; lovely service,"I just completed a week's stay at the hotel.  I chose it based on TripAdvisor reviews and its proximity to Victoria Station for access to the train to Glyndebourne.  I could not have picked a better choice.  Having read about the construction noise, I asked for a quiet room, which the staff provided.  From the interior, I heard nothing and slept well in the comfortable room.  All amenities were fine and on a par with excellent big city hotels.  But most importantly, the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful, which makes 41 rather unusual for a big city hotel.  I highly recommend it."
February 2013,Lovely small hotel,"I chose this hotel because of the reviews on trip advisor and I'm glad I did. The location was good being two minutes walk from Victoria, the staff were very attentive and the room was very cosy. We had breakfast and dinner at the hotel and both very good, my boyfriend was adamant that the eggs benedict were the best he had ever had. In the evening they have ""raid the larder"" where you can get loads of different nibbles to have with your per dinner drinks free of charge, everything from crisps and nuts to mini cottage pies and ice cream. The staff allowed us to open a bottle of our own wine to have with our fabulous afternoon tea as we had recently returned from Italy and bought a couple of bottles back with us which we thought was very good. We also had a lovely full body…"
June 2013,Attentive Service,"What I Liked Most  Attentive service, the extra touches  What I Liked Least The corridors are a maze and poorly signposted, power cuts  Stayed here for 3 bitterly cold February days.  After navigating 5 flights of stairs because of the power cuts (there was construction outside), we were welcomed in the library with a drink of our choice (not the usual take-it-or-leave-it fruit punch). Of course we could not go to our room because there was no power.  At least there were candles in the library.  The library is tastefully African-themed, where you get (excellent) breakfast, and where we also enjoyed afternoon tea (included).  The staff are friendly and welcoming without being intrusive.  Point to note though: the desk is by the door and when you walk in, there are frequently a…"
June 2013,Shhhhhhhhhhhh.,"Shhhhhhh, don't tell anyone: All the reviews are true. This is a truly fabulous hotel, the most attentive staff, delightful rooms and the most comfortable beds and all within meters of Buckingham Palace, but lets keep it secret ?"
December 2012,Simply the best I've ever experienced.,"Unfortunately I only stayed here one night and how disappointed I was!! I wish I could have stayed a week at least!   I arrived at Victoria station and was unsure which way to go so I rang the hotel for advice. They told me to wait where I was and promptly collected me! How fantastic!   I immediately felt comfortable and welcome in the hotel, the check in was seamless, efficient and very warm. And the glass of champagne on arrival was most appreciated too!   The rooms are beautiful, luxurious in every sense of the word and extremely comfortable.   Now what makes this hotel stand out is the staff. They are exceptional and SO professional. You cannot possibly fault any of them! It is simply the best service I've ever encountered.   The icing on the cake - I rang the hotel two days…"
May 2013,Wow,Excellent hotel in all areas and highly recommend staying here. The rooms where excellent and the beds very comfortable. The location is perfect and ideal for all the major attraction in London and staff are brilliant and always there to help you in anyway.
May 2013,Attentive Service,"We came here having researched hotels close to Buckingham Palace where we were lucky to have been invited to the royal garden party. The hotel is very close to the Palace indeed. Just a few minutes walk and we were there. It has the atmosphere of a private gentleman's club but in a very good way. The hotel occupies just one floor. Our room, an executive king room, was not the hugest that we have stayed in but it was very comfortable and had all necessary amenities. The best things about the hotel are the executive lounge where drinks, snacks and breakfast are served and the staff themselves. The staff are very attentive and make the effort to address you by name. Nothing was too much trouble. We would definitely return."
May 2013,Excellent well recommended fellow reviewers,We stayed at the 41 last night and were not let down by fellow trip advisor reviewers.  It truly is an excellent hotel with friendly staff and flawless service amongst the best we have found anywhere.  From the warm welcome and refreshing champagne to the professional check out we were very impressed.  A slight glitch caused by a fellow guest which was outside the control of the hotel was handeled swifty and the resolution was by far in excess of expectations. Although we were not actually in Buckingham Palace we felt as though we were treated like royalty. We will not be strangers hotel 41 see you soon.
May 2013,A brightly sparkling jewel.,"Hotel 41 will always be our hotel whenever we visit London.The rooms are large & beautifully appointed  ~ just 2 blocks from Victoria Station tube. I am hard pressed to think of any hotel with as over- the -top phenomenal service as this jewel. The staff was amazingly welcoming, helpful, & charming...allowing us to feel at home each & every day by remembering our names, inquiring about our day, asking about our needs, providing wonderful complimentary snacks every afternoon & evening. The staff just couldn't do enough for you...they truly had your interest at heart. The breakfast was great and the setting of the lovely lounge where it was served made you want to stay all day. We would refer to returning to 41 at the end of a busy day as ""going home""."
May 2013,"Everything you could ask for for a ""reasonable"" price","The 41 is a top notch hotel.  I've been fortunate to stay in some wonderful hotels including several Ritz-Carltons, the Ritz Paris and a Sangri-La.  This hotel does not dissapoint in any way.  And, though not cheap, was less expensive than the competition.    The room was large for London and beautifully decorated.  The staff was overwhelmingly helpful, courteous and friendly.  They made us feel important and appreciated.    The breakfast was great.  I didn't have any of the complimentary food in the evening, but my wife did and enjoyed it.  Complimentary bottled water day or night was nice, too.  The location is great. (How could it not be across the street from Buckingham Palace)  It was less than a 5 minute walk to trains or underground at Victoria Station.  I would…"
May 2013,Wonderful Find!,"The 41 far surpasses any expectations I had for a stay in London. Based on the reviews, I expected to have a great stay, but it was still better than I could have imagined. the staff was so very accommodating, they offered us complimentary beverages upon arrival at the front desk, then another offer of complimentary Champaign upon check in. After they personally escorted us to our room, we walked in to find a personal greeting card and handmade candies on the table inside the room. Also on the table was a beautiful white orchid plant (what a nice touch!) The room had a fire place as well, and when we called the front desk to have it turned on the staff was to our room and had it turned on within five minutes of calling. The 'Executive Lounge' is quite nice as well. Complete with…"
May 2013,Fantastic Stay!,"My mother and I stayed at the Hotel 41 on our recent trip to London.  The hotel was beautiful, had a fantastic location near Buckingham Palace, and the room was unbelievable.  Having never been to London before, the staff graciously directed us to amazing attractions and restaurants.  The staff and service they provided definitely made our trip, they were the best ever!"
May 2013,Rare find,"This is an extraordinary property and well executed in all aspects, but by far the chief appeal is the tremendous staff associated with the hotel.  Without exception, this special oasis is populated with A+ team members clearly handpicked with an eye for authentic personal passion for the hospitality trade."
March 2013,Hotel41...where!,"Stayed for a night with my wife as it was near the show we were going to. Taxi driver had no idea where it was which is part of the dark mystery of the hotel according to the concierge. It's stuck between Reuben's 43 and a bar. Entered the building and spent 10 mins waiting with an overly enthusiastic welcome committee, the hotel only has 28 rooms all on the 5th floor, we were escorted to floor 5 with staff falling over themselves to greet us.  Don't get me wrong, the decor is good and if small is what you like then this is the place for you, as there are only 28 rooms, you seem to always have way too many staff asking if all is well and bothering you, on more than one occasion I was in deep conversation with my wife when a body or two just appeared next to us! Standing there…"
June 2013,Service with style,"My Husband & I stayed here for one night whilst in London. Our room was lovely, well equipped, clean and quietly located. Wonderful service experienced during our stay.. Complimentary chocolates and champagne as it was our anniversary as well as going the extra mile with restaurant bookings and just a special kind of service which ft natural not forced as in other establishments. Location fantastic, breakfast divine... All in all wonderful!"
June 2013,"Hidden jewel with exceptional service, the 5 star Hotel 41 exceeded our expectations.","We just returned from a week stay in London with our family.  We traveled with our two boys ages 17 and 13, my wife's parents and my mother.  We had 4 rooms for the family for the week.  The rooms were all very comfortable and charming, and the Executive Lounge was a great place to meet.  The service was extraordinary and the staff made everyone feel at home.  The resident manager Lauren was exceptional, and we felt like Remis, Stafan, and Monika were part of our family.  We enjoyed the breakfast every morning, and it was great coming back for tea and cocktails later each day.  The food service was outstanding and the restaurant at the adjoining hotel (the Bbar) was fabulous.  Although the hotel does not have a fitness center, they have full health club privileges at the LA…"
May 2013,Outstanding as always,"We have just spent our second wedding anniversary in a row at the 41. From the moment we were immediatly recognised and spoilt. This place is about personal service and personal touches. Complimentary fine champage whilst you check in sitting down in a comfortable fat leather chair.  We asked for the same executive room as last year which was done with no hassle at all and after enjoying an afternoon and early evening in London we returned to the executive lounge to enjoy wonderful complementry canapes and snacks finsihed of with hagan das icecream!  The Hotel team had arranged a suprise beautiful turn down service in the bedroom with rose petals on the bed and through out the room, candles and romantic music (michael Buble)  - just wonderful.  The late breakfast the next day…"
June 2013,Wow! We can't wait to go back!,"The best hotel experience ever! Prior expensive London stays elsewhere have been hit and miss. 41 was worth every penny! Brilliantly clean, delightfully comfortable, decadently luxurious! Amazingly, the staff were ALL helpful and friendly. They made it their business to anticipate our needs and then some! They booked tickets to WICKED for us and before we even went to the theatre, there was an autographed poster from the show on our bed! When we got back from the show, there were candles and rosepetals arranged all over the room! The guest lounge has a superb honour bar, delicious nibblies. These people put the boutique in boutique hotel!! If you want to spoil yourself for a night or a week in London, this is the place to do it!"
May 2013,Incomparable service,"We have stayed at several 5 stars however, ""41"" was unique in a couple of respects.  First and foremost, the staff. The entire staff was supremely attentive.  How they all seemed to know our names from day one is a mystery.   They made us feel very special and volunteered to attend to details so that we could just enjoy the vacation. Like having your own personal staff.  Second, the ""boutique"" facility.  Loved it. Comfortable and classy with special touches like heated towel rods.  And everything that we wanted was right there just a few steps away.  Definitely like the small, boutique setup.  We will be back!!!"
June 2013,Exceptional stay for our anniversary,"This was one of the best if not the best hotel we have ever stayed at. The staff, room, service, amenities were amazing. The staff was exceptionally attentive, helpful, and engaging. Very luxurious rooms and clean bathrooms, great location. The executive lounge well stocked with foods throughout the day and night and very pleasant to relax in. We were on a three week trip through Europe for our 30th anniversary, the staff made our first night special with extra attention, our stay at Hotel 41 was by far our best hotel experience in Europe."
June 2013,Excellent Venue & Staff,"Most enjoyable trip. This hotel is a hidden Gem! Staff was beyond excellent, rooms were excellent. Lounge was convenient and cozy. Again the staff went above and beyond to make you feel welcomed, and important."
June 2013,Unforgettable weekend,"I am lucky to have just spent the weekend at this fantastic hotel. From the moment we walked in to a champagne meet & greet, the whole experience was completely customer focused.  The staff cannot do enough for you, the surroundings are stylish, and you do not feel anonymous at all. I could go on and on but suffice to say we will be back, especially as the other half proposed to me with lots of secret help from the staff! Thank you Hotel 41! "
May 2013,Have they paid for the No 1 spot???,"This hotel basically consists of the top floor of the Ruben´s hotel, located right next door. They have tried to create a clubby atmosphere by setting up an executive lounge that is the center of the ""hotel"", where you eat and drink 24 hrs. This is quite cozy. The rooms are well-designed and the bathrooms are ok, if  somewhat aged. The TV, hidden away in a cabinet is too small to view, and looks like it was acquired in the end of the nineties. Further on the downside, there is no gym, spa or pool. Now, considering those downsides and the price of 410 pounds per night that I paid you would expect excellent service. I did not get that. The room I got faced a construction site (they have demolished the next block and are rebuilding it) where they were drilling at one o´clock in the…"
June 2013,Best kept secret in London!,"First-class hotel - second to none!  From arrival to departure, I cannot find any criticism with Hotel 41 whatsoever.  The staff were extremely attentive, polite and engaging.  Hotel 41 is immaculately clean and very pleasing to the eye.  Superb location too.  Well done hotel 41!"
August 2012,all we hoped,"The service from the very start was excellent.I emailed the hotel before arrival to say our flight arrived at 6.30am and we would like to store our bags and if possible have assess to a shower.We arrived to have a room available and a cup of tea served in this room.We were also informed we could use the room for as long as we liked and later our bags would be moved to another room,which was a free upgrade,WOW ! The upgraded room was larger,had a seperate shower and bath ,and a study area.It was lovely.Thoughout our stay wr would come back to our room to find olives,chocolates,and one evening slices of cake with happy anniversary written on the plate. The location of this hotel is wonderful.Short walk to Victoria Station and all the major sights walking distance.There are plenty…"
July 2013,One of the best places to stay!,I've been lucky to stay at Hotel 41 several times and every time has been wonderful. The hotel staff are incredibly service oriented and no ask is too small. The rooms are beautifully decorated. Location is great. Cannot say enough good things about this hotel!
May 2013,Perfectly Classic British,"Unfortunately we were only able to stay at this hotel one night and my husband and I both wished we were able to stay longer.  I really love small personal boutique hotels and 41 is just that - personal in every way.  First the hotel is in a great location - directly across the street from Buckingham Palace.  Upon arrival we were greeted with a lovely glass of champagne - what's better than that!!!  Our room was perfect - black and white decor with British prints on the wall, comfortable king size bed with soft linen, well appointed bathroom, plenty of storage space if you like to unpack - even with drawers in the bathroom, sofa and chair in the room, and the best - a fireplace!!!!  Our room was down the hall from the lounge - decorated like a beautiful sitting room.  Breakfast…"
June 2013,Amazing Ambiance and Service,"We spent three nights at Hotel 41 starting off the European portion of our honeymoon. Upon check-in, we decided to upgrade from an executive suite to their Conservatory suite, to get the maximum 41 experience. Although very pricy, the suite was amazing. We had a stay-three-pay-two package that offered a full English breakfast with all the trimmings.  Service at 41 was second to none! Lauren and her staff did, as other reviewers have stated, ""treated us like royalty"".   We tried the optional Leopard bar champagne experience that was an amazing mix of food and champagne in a very romantic atmosphere with highly personalized service. Highly recommended!  One night after dinner, returning to our  room with ""relies"", we saw that we were ""romantically rosed"". WOW! We returned to find…"
July 2013,Meets Expectations And More,"My wife and I recently spent five nights at Hotel 41 as part of an anniversary celebration.  We were excited to go because of the excellent reviews we read on TA.  I have to say this hotel provided an experience beyond what we could have conjured.  What makes this hotel distinct is the level of service provided to  the guests.  I cannot imagine you will experience anything better.  From check-in, with a glass of champagne of your choice, to check-out we were treated in royal fashion. Any problem or request was undertaken in a flash, often by more than one of the mangers.  Service in the Lounge was exemplary.  Let me give special thanks to managers Stefan and Monika for making our stay special.  We stayed in an Executive King room.  Although it was not large there were many…"
July 2013,Still an excellent hotel,Staff is working 24/7 to make your stay as pleasant as possible. 2 Nights in this hotel makes you want to come back for more. The staff thinks in solutions not in unanswered questions. As I said before this is a gem in London. We will be back.
June 2013,Can't wait to return!,"Lovely experience from beginning to end.  My daughter and I stayed at Hotel 41 only one night, sadly, but it was an exquisite end to two weeks in England and France.  I absolutely cannot wait to bring my husband back to this divine hotel.  Elegant, comfortable, well-appointed boutique hotel, and the staff could not be any more attentive and accomodating.  I have stayed in $10K per night rooms in Las Vegas hotels, and I have never experienced service and quality equal to Hotel 41.  This hotel makes the horrible 10 hour flight from the USA (even with rude flight attendants) worthwhile.  I'm plotting to get back to London at Christmas now."
January 2013,Congratulations on Hotel of the Year Award!,"Congratulations, Team 41 on your well-deserved Catey Award for Hotel of the Year. I read in the news that "" The Cateys"" are the hotel industry's version of The Oscars, so this is confirmation of your position at the very pinnacle of the business.  As regular monthly guests we always look forward to our visits and in a fortnight (our next one) we will be looking out for the Catey statue itself which we hope is on display in the Executive Lounge.  But most of all, we will look forward to congratulating the team in person.  Very well done, all of you.  See you  soon.  Celia"
June 2013,We're coming back!,"My husband & I are eagerly awaiting our fourth stay at 41. We adore this elegant, comfortable & welcoming hotel. Each time we arrive back after an outing it feels as if we've arrived home.  All the staff are very attentive & showed great concern when my husband was unwell. They even welcomed visits & breakfasts dates with our London daughter. No better place to stay."
May 2013,Amazing hotel in London,"We just returned from our trip to London and had to share our amazing experience. From the time we checked in until check out, we were treated to the most wonderful service, professional and helpful staff,  and a luxurious, comfortable room at this hotel. The staff, who know you by name, are available at all times to help with reservations, recommendations, maps, tickets or whatever you could possibly need while in London. They went above and beyond to be helpful but never intrusive. We felt so at home while there. The location is ideal for walking everywhere as it is centrally located to all of London's main attractions and shopping.  Also walking distance to the tube. The little touches of his/her slippers, the candle lit in the bathroom at night, the warmed towels and the…"
May 2012,Like staying with family,"Beginning with the hallway-reception leading only to one lift, the well-appointed yet traditionally styled bedrooms, beautiful but small bathrooms, quirky location on the top floor of the Ruben and sound-padded yet creaky hallways, this hotel definitely does not fit into the usual 5-star experience offered by other chains.  I realised the issues for other reviewers when they complained about odd-shaped rooms, lack of view, small ground floor foyer, no pool or staff that were almost intrusive. I would say that Hotel 41 does not endeavour to be a high-rise luxury modern facility so commonly available.  Instead, their forte is in their staff and service. Champagne at check-in. Reception staff were guaranteed to be smiling and eager to offer recommendations for restaurants, shows or…"
April 2013,What more could you want?,"There is a reason that this hotel is ranked so highly on these review websites. I will keep this one short. I have stayed in some incredible hotels, but nothing quite like hotel 41. While the staff, rooms, services, location etc are all beyond what anyone could expect, it is the atmosphere that really did it for me. The two nights that my partner and I stayed there seem like a dream. Sooo so good. I will be back!!"
April 2013,"No request too large, no detail too small","This must be the philosophie of the Hotel, this becomes evident during your stay. What a warm welcome by the charming hosts at the welcome desk, which is located in the cozy library/lounge. You feel like entering in some ones private home, which obviously is decorated in an exclusive style. The staterooms are in black and white, which gives it a contemporary touch. I enjoyed having a bathtub as well as a seperate rainfall shower, what a treat. The fluffy towels and the 100ml Penhaligon's bath and shower amenities add to the luxury. One does want to spend the full day in bed, made by Savoir and dressed with finest crisp linnen, what a feeling. I enjoyed sitting in the library close the fireplace having a drink and a barsnack, which is available around the clock. Breakfast ist…"
April 2013,If you want to be treated like royalty stay at 41 hotel.,41 hotel was the most amazing experience I have ever encountered on vacation.  The service was superb and the staff were attentive to your needs.  This is the only hotel that I want to stay in.  My friends and I were treated as royalty from the time we stepped foot out of our taxi.  Thanks to all the wonderful staff at 41 hotel.
March 2013,"The quality of service, attention to detail and luxury that EVERY hotel should aspire to!","I won't repeat the well deserved superlatives that Hotel 41 warrants, but our return visit proved that our findings on our first stay were far from a fluke! The staff are just as attentive, charming, genuinely friendly and live to ensure that you enjoy your stay. It's not difficult to revel in the luxuriance of this top quality hotel and nothing is too much trouble for every member of the young and professional staff headed by Lauren. The hotel is ideally situated. We found a lovely gem of a find around the corner from Hotel 41, The Westminster Cathedral, which, apart from being an impressively ornate Victorian Catholic cathedral, has a tower with awesome views across the London skyline in all directions. Save yourself £24 (I understand its £29 at The Shard)  and spend £5 for an…"
April 2013,"Comfort, service and treat at hotel 41","As already described by others, the service in this botique hotel is pleasent and personalized. I noticed a few business people using the facilities as their living room, which of course is nice if the travel iteniary is intensive and you want to get away from the international branded hotels. My wife loved the hotel and room decoration.  After a busy day we were going out for dinner, and decided to have a drink in the library/bar/lounge and ended up staying there in front of the fireplace. We were kindly offered some nice appetizers and this took us further to the free buffet of a high standard. This is a nice treat. It seems to be a mixed clientele, business people, get-away holidayas and turists. The hotel situated next to buckingham palace invites to spend some time in the…"
April 2013,Hotel 41 - why I may never stay anywhere else in London again.,"We stay in London fairly frequently, and usually with children. This was our 48 hour ""escape break"" without children and Hotel 41 ticked all the boxes. For so many reasons it is rated number 1 in London and the rating is 100% accurate.  The welcome at the front desk was very friendly, and you felt expected. Cara was the lovely lady who came to greet us and accompany us upstairs. Check-in was accompanied by a glass of champagne and then we had a seat by the fire before being shown our room. Stylish, large for London, a wonderfully comfortable bed, pillow menu etc...all the small things that make you feel special. As this was a trip to celebrate our wedding anniversary, there were many special gifts from the hotel...a romantic turndown where the room was prepared for our return…"
April 2013,The Absolute 5 Star Hotel *****,"I currently live in Barnard Castle, and had a long trip journey to London and had just a bit of trouble finding the right Five Star Hotel. I found this place and currently inside the Hotel while writing this review.  The hotel experience by the server's are really briliiant and fabulous as they're speedness is skilled and extremely friendly. The sleep qualitiness is brilliant and everything else here is absolutely amazing.  There are no complaints in regards of this Hotel Experience with my family and friends. I don't hesitate to highly recommend this hotel for everyone who are going in a journey to London, this is the right place to stay for the trip.  The hotel is absolutely large and huge (at the same time), enough rooms for everyone. The rooms are very clean, good value for…"
May 2012,Great team,"a great combination of city and boutique hotel. the stuff is amazing and service oriented. rooms are big and comfortable. all the small bits and pieces are high quality and well needed. braekfast is great, room service is very good. location is tourististic oriented, not comfortable for shopping or city meetings, good for West End seekers. TV is small but u have one in the bathroom.  they have a special call button - ANYTHING, ANYTIME"
December 2012,Amazing hotel,"Small rooms, as you'd expect from an London hotel, but this is an amazing hotel none the less. The lounge is very comfortable, the staff are very attentive. I would recommend it but it is expensive. I would stay again"
March 2013,Amazingly Relaxed and Comfortable,"Stayed just before Xmas (sorry bit late catching up), for a pre-xmas break. Breakfast - best in London? Probably. Bed comfortable (stayed in junior suite). They think of everything here that makes you feel the most important person there.  The staff cannot do more for you, they are there just when you need them.  We enjoyed it so much we went back again in March and stayed in the same room. Also the Library Restaurant in the sister hotel next door is superb."
March 2013,"If I could rate it six, I would!","You will struggle to find better service and attention to detail than at Hotel.   I'm not going to spoilt it for you by telling you all the lovely things they do to delight you but you will not be dissapointed. Really personal memorable touches that we have not experienced anywhere.  Are well travelled, always 5 star hotels - few can compare.  There the many nice things Lauren and the team did to make our anniversary special but the 2 stand out items were.... 1. The special turndown, soooo romantic. I'm not saying anything as the surprise was everything. 2. Lauren knew that we had left our son at home for our special night.  When we checked out, she gave us a beautiful bag of sweeties and chocolates all tied with red ribbons.   Thank you Hotel 41, we hope to see you again soon"
July 2012,Service above and beyond,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hotel 41.  The service was exceptional, and the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome.  Nicole in particular was very helpful with recommendations and advise, and was even able to locate tickets to a sold out show.  I will recommend this hotel to all of my family and friends."
February 2013,First Class all the way!,"I chose this hotel after reading many reviews on TripAdvisor and they were spot on!  We stayed 2 nights here after a cruise before flying home and it was the perfect choice.  Right at check in we were greeted and treated to a beverage of our choice and seated at the desk to receive our room.  When we asked about a restaurant within walking distance they pointed us to the one right next door and the Hotel Manager even called ahead to treat us to a glass of champagne before dinner!    Location was ideal for us, it's directly across the street and one block down to the entrance of Buckingham Palace which we were able to tour due to the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.    Our room was beautiful, we couldn't have been more pleased. We will definitely return!"
March 2013,Hotel 41,"My family (husband and three children) stayed in one of the suites in eary February. The staff were wonderful, very attentive  - couldn't do enough for us . The suite was a bit cramped with the five of us but still fabulous, with a huge, extremely comfy, king size bed and 2 sofa beds which weren't so comfortable.The location was perfect, food was fabulous and the kids enjoyed 'raiding the pantry' most nights. A big thank you to Lauren and her team who made our London experience extremely enjoyable."
April 2012,"Privacy, comfort and style","COnveniently located close to Victoria Station, perfect if you flew in at Gatewick and if you enjoy some early morning jogging around St.James and Buckingham Palace. Beautiful rooms and delicious breakfast in a stilish environment. Excellent staff. Quality has its price, but it is good value for your money."
November 2012,too popular. for good reason!,"my husband and i stayed here almost 2 years ago. we get regular red carnation e mail and thought let's stay again this weekend.  (we are from los angeles, live in paris and travel to england several times a year for various events). this time, we will be attending a concert at the royal opera house and this hotel is close enough, but far enough from the craziness of covent garden to be convenient. but now that the 41 is ranked 1 on trip advisor, it is way too popular for us to book/afford!  (we will let you know where we end up staying  this weekend....  i'm certain it will end up at the top of the list, again...)  the 41 reputation is well deserved.  we have stayed at many 5 star hotels in london but we really liked this exceptional small hotel and wanted to return..."
February 2013,spent last 4 nights of our honeymoon at 41...treated like the royal family!,Had stayed at Rubens at the Palace many years ago but wanted something a little more special for the last 4 days of our honeymoon on our way back to the States from Africa. We were tired from travel and arrived late in the evening. We had to wait a bit in the downstairs lobby but finally made it upstairs to the Executive Lounge where we were warmly welcomed and treated to champagne as we checked in. We were given a full tour of our room which ended up being quite small and had some plumbing issues. They didn't have any other large-size rooms to move us to that evening so allowed us access to a nearby small room for use of the bathroom and then officially switched us to a larger junior-suite type room the following day for the remainder of our stay. They handed the entire move…
March 2013,Best Hotel in London,My new favorite Hotel in London. We used to stay at Claridge's but thought would try something different. We are so pleased that we did. Lauren was amazing and really made us feel very welcome. My only complaint would be that the room was a little on the small side. The Executive Lounge is amazing as was the breakfast. Definitely deserves its number 1 status.
March 2013,A great experience,"We loved it here. The service can be a bit overpowering - staff seem to outnumber guests. The executive lounge is a home from home, and we used it rather than the somewhat pokey room. Good location near Buckingham Palace, and good use of the Rubens Hotel facilities. Definitely recommended, one of the best hotels in London."
March 2013,Outstanding experience!,"Just returned from my stay at Hotel 41, and am wishing I'd stayed longer! I found Hotel 41 on here by accident whilst browsing for a hotel on Park lane, I saw the reviews and couldn't quite believe how highly it was recommended, and at a price similar, if not cheaper than other hotels in the area.   As soon as I arrived I was taken aback by the service, I've never known anything like it! From checking in to showing me to my room the attention to detail was amazing. I had to dash out early on to go to an event at park lane, but when I arrived back I was pleasantly surprised to find a hot water bottle warming my bed accompanied by music and refreshments! The room was of course amazing, I was in a king size suite I believe, and it was immaculate with a huge comfy bed and awesome…"
June 2012,Great place to stay,"We spent 3 nights at Hotel 41 (room 4106) and loved it.  We booked the English cooked breakfast option, but could also raid the continental breakfast bar while we waited for our food.  We utilised the ""Raid the Pantry"" service after 8:30pm when we returned from the Lion King show one night, and an evening tour of the Buckingham Palace State Rooms on another.  The location is great and we had an easy, leisurely walk with coffee stops and lunch on our first day passing or visiting the following sights - Royal Mews, Queen's Gallery, Admiralty Arch, Horse Guards Parade, Big Ben, London Eye, Palace of Westminster, 10 Downing Street, Trafalgar Square, Nelson's Column, Admiralty Arch, St James's Park.  A convenience store, restaurants and shops are behind the hotel and major stores are…"
March 2013,"Actually, it is the #1 hotel in London","My husband and I stayed there a year ago and, after reading the last reviewer, I felt the need to post. First of all, I have stayed at many 5 star hotels, all over the world, and Hotel 41 is one of the best. The location is unbelievable..it is right across the street from Buckinham Palace. So, it is not right in front of the ""gates,"" where no hotels are anyway, but, from our room, we could see inside the Palace walls. I remember watching guests arrive for the Queen's Julibee and this all happened right outside our hotel window. Secondly, the staff could not have been more welcoming, professional or knowledgable. Not only did they greet us with a glass of wine (pressed shirts and all), but they helped us out with dinner reservations & show tickets. The hotel is very exclusive,…"
March 2013,Not the Number 1 Hotel in London,"I want to start off by saying Hotel 41 is nice, but it is not the number 1 hotel in London. It doesn't have the beauty or service to be number 1. My wife and I were invited to the UK to attend the big Rugby International between Wales and England.  We decided to go a day early and spend a night in London.  Although we have been very satisfied with some top hotels on Park Lane in Hyde Park, we decided to take a look at other top properties in London to experience other fine hotels.  A friend recommended I pick the number 1 hotel on Trip Advisor.  Hotel 41 is listed as the top hotel in London so we booked it expecting the best.  When we arrived in London, the hotel transfer went smoothly from the airport.  The hotel is located on Buckingham Palace Lane which I thought would afford…"
March 2013,Really Super,"My sister and her husband often stay here and pursuaded us to book for our joint birthday and anniversary celebration. We were looked after like family and not that over the top, too smiley sort of service but genuinely gracious, competent service.  The sort of service which only comes from properly training and supporting your staff and understanding how to provide real luxury with ease.  The staff all knew each other and clearly wanted to be there and make sure you had a lovely time. The room was turned down beautifully and when it came to check-out, when I enquired what time it was, it was so refreshing to be told to ""take your time"", ""no rush - enjoy your Sunday morning"".  Having worked in the industry for a short time myself, I know this causes problems with Housekeeping…"
March 2013,Like Royalty,"We recently spent the week in London and enjoyed the magnificent 41 Hotel.  We did not know which hotel to select for our trip so we simply went to tripadvisor and chose the hotel with the #1 rating.  Turns out it was 41 Hotel and we were not at all disappointed!  After spending a week in our 'home away from home' we feel we must join the ranks of those who sing their praise.  My husband and I selected a suite as we were traveling with our 18 year old son.  The room was so comfortable and tastefully furnished.  It's not often the hotel rooms look like their pictures but in this case, the hotel really is as beautiful as we see online.  Monika, the assistant manager, went out of her way to make sure that not only were my husband and I comfortable but to make certain our son felt…"
March 2013,a week of royal indulgence,"I wanted to stay somewhere close to Buckingham Palace where I would be attending a ceremony to receive my CBE. This hotel could not be closer, opposite the Royal Mews and only a few minutes walk to the Palace gates. I booked 3 nights in a Junior Suite taking advantage of the 3 nights for 2 suite offer. My Aunt came down from Scotland for the event and we arrived on the Monday afternoon to a warm welcome and a glass of champagne. Contrary to a recent review we found the staff to be very genuine, friendly and eager to make our stay the very best that it could be. The suite was great and being split level, felt like a little flat. We arrived to tropical fruit and bottle of champagne on ice. We felt immediately relaxed and enjoyed our beauty sleep in preparation of the big day.…"
November 2012,Our London home,"Returning to our regular hotel - well, more of a return to our friends and the 41 family.  We stay here about once a month on business in the city and occasionally include leisure. On this occasion, it was a sudden need to be in Town for an extra fitting for a mother-of-the-bride outfit.  As always, the staff were welcoming, friendly and professional.  Our visit happened to coincide with my birthday week, which we celebrated with dinner at a favourite restaurant.  On our return, in addition to the card, there was a beautiful celebration turn down in our room, sincere felicitations from all the staff, including the housekeeper this morning.  As usual, our every need was catered for and often anticipated.  The raid the larder facility provided a late night cheese and port on the…"
May 2012,Disappointing!,"My fiancée and I were excited to stay here after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor but unfortunately the hotel did not live up to its reputation. The room was cramped and overfurnished with ageing furniture. We were woken at 5am every morning by staff walking in the corridor beside our room. The breakfast was mediocre and on occasions cold, as it was brought up from the kitchen at the hotel next door. The service was variable. The manager was delightful and helpful but some if her staff felt the need to patronise us and lacked authenticity. I think this hotel is trying to capture a private club environment but it just doesn't work. I have stayedvat private London clubs in the past and this felt like a Disney version. Would not stay again!"
March 2013,Probably the Best Hotel Experience Ever!,"This place is simply amazing! The entrance is tucked away beside the Ruben's hotel and is essentially one of the floors of this establishment run separately. The room we stayed in was the opulent Master Conservatory Suite which extends over two levels and boasts a massive skylight in the upstairs bedroom. A little noisy at night, but I suspect most places in central London are...  What sets this place apart though, are the people. There is a lounge room constantly staffed by the most knowledgeable, helpful and friendly people of any place we've stayed.Bar none. Period. They just welcomed us in, and made us feel at home right from the very start. Unobtrusive, but always immediately available. The lounge and all of its amenities felt like a spacious extension of our room, and the…"
March 2013,A great hotel in a great location in London.,A return visitor to Hotel 41. I think what makes this hotel stand out from the crowd is the focus on a high quality service. Of course the prime location is also a key factor. If your looking for cheap - go somewhere else. But if your looking for a world class hotel with high guest service levels this hotel will not disappoint. Treat yourself.   Congrats to management and staff. Keep it up.
March 2012,Hotel 41-Fantastic Stay!,"My wife have stayed at 41 before and thouroughly enjoyed it. We stayed on March 2nd 2013 for her 41st birthday( worked well with the Hotel name!)  We have stayed in many many nice 'top end hotels'-Dorchester, 4 seasons etc etc, but Hotel 41 for the experince and service levels is the best we have stayed in.  I cannot speak too highly of Lauren and the entire team who make it their absolute mission to make your stay perfect.   A small and intimate hotel."
February 2013,41 is INCREDIBLE,"Hospitality workers should be required to stay at this gracious hotel before working elsewhere. 41 is 41 Buckingham Palace Road. Yes, THAT Buckingham Palace Road - across the road from the Queen's house. Our room overlooked the Queen's backyard. The service it TOP NOTCH. Wonderful fireplaces. Excellently decorated rooms. If possible, spend a few nights in the Conservatory Master Suite. You will know it is worth every penny when you lie on the bed, hot the remote and the ceiling opens There is nowhere else in London quite like our Conservatory Master Suite. Where else could you sleep in such opulent luxury beneath the twinkling city stars? If you tire of the view, electric blinds turn your split-level suite into a private paradise complete with a HUGE, immaculate marbled bathroom…"
February 2013,Central London Cocoon.,"My husband and I booked into a junior suite in Hotel 41 on the 3 nights for 2 deal, to celebrate our anniversary. Our first impressions were of a discreet and beautifully outfitted hotel. The welcome was personal and friendly, and we could immediately tell that if we had needed any help organising things to do, then Monika and team would have been more than happy to assist. The team's attention to detail was visible in many small areas, but especially so in the little romantic surprise they arranged for us on our arrival.  Our suite was split over two levels, with a cosy lounge area downstairs, and desk, bed and bathroom upstairs. The bed was very comfortable, with a thoughtful hot water bottle provided as part of the turn-down on the chillier nights. The bathroom had a lovely…"
February 2013,"Their motto is ""Your Home Away From Home"" is so true!","We arrived on Valentine's Day for our final three night stay in England.  We could not have picked a better place to stay.  From the first email contact, assisting us with Valentine's dinner reservations, to a follow up email when we returned home, the service was spectacular. The pre-ordered pillow selection was awesome (as were the pillows).  The champagne arrival greeting tradition (Veuve Clicquot no less!) is something I want to continue at home!  Time was taken to explain the breakfast and the late night pantry raid and honor bar, as well as all the features in our room.  The room was large and comfortable.  Our room #4111 had a choice of two showers.  A small upright and a tub shower.  We used both and found the rain type shower head to be incredible.  The wonderful…"
February 2013,Great,I spend 3 nights in this hotel on a business trip. Rooms are well appointed and have all you need for your stay. The staff is great and always happy to assists and offer their service without having to ask. The only downside is that a gym or sauna is missing.
February 2013,"Beautiful hotel, great service","My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night using the Valentines package. Brilliant value for money and we were made to feel extremely special. Good quality champagne on arrival (not fizzy wine) and a pantry of goodies to raid in the wee hours. The staff were very friendly and welcoming, asking about our day and what plans we had during our stay with genuine interest. The decor is lovely, the hotel is quite small but the space has been used brilliantly. It was great spending a cold sunday morning by the log fire in the lounge having breakfast and reading the papers while a blue sky beamed through the conservatory-like ceiling The pricing may seem a bit steep at first but for the location and quality it's cheap-as-chips! No request was too much trouble and we'll defintely be…"
January 2013,unique,"we spent a fantastic weekend in London and had a unique experience at 41. The hospitality, quality and attention of the staff are just exceptional. It is very different from most 5 stars hotels we have stayed in. BR Switzerland."
February 2013,What a place,I had a 4 day business trip in London and my company arranged a stay in Hotel 41. I cannot thank them enough for having me into this wonderful place. The room is classy and luxury. You cannot ask for something to be changed for better. The staff is maybe the most helpful i have ever seen with always a big smile on their faces. I will definitely come back here again but next time will be for vacation with my family.
February 2013,"As previously stated:  If you don't like this place, stay home","Every whim is tended to.  Rooms are wonderfully appointed, we had a fireplace that was just hearth warming.  Meticulous attention to detail is the standard here.  Twenty four hour food and drink service, either at the spacious and private dining area or delivered immediately to your room.  Whatever you need, it will be done.  Really not that expensive considering the superior quality you receive, we have paid much more for much less.  Location is paramount to almost every event you wish to see in London.  (when Victoria station is completed, this will even be more accessible).  Quiet rooms, plush beds, steaming hot water, crisp sheets, I could go on and on.  This is rated number one for a reason, don't question, just book."
December 2012,"Great Service, small rooms.","Couldn't fault the service - they really did a great job of looking after us.  The exec lounge where you check in has a nice feel and is intimate and cosy.  Nice little spread of food there day and night so you can graze anytime you like.  Only criticism is the size of the rooms (specifically in relation to the price)  We paid about £440 for an exec room which was as small a room as I've ever stayed in, and smaller than other rooms I've paid £400+ for.  The bath was tiny - strictly 1 person at a time, and a small person at that.  Anyone over 6'4"" wouldn't even be able to stand up straight in the shower, so low is the ceiling.  Overall it was a good experience, but if you suffer from claustrophobia or like a bit of space, the rooms might not be for you."
December 2012,A Christmas treat!,"This was our second time at 41 and it was every bit as good as the first.  We stayed for 4 nights over Christmas as a treat for our wedding anniversary.  On arrival we were sad to hear that Frederic had left,  but Monika, Lauren and the rest of the team made us feel at home immediately. It's a special place to stay, everyone is so friendly and the location is great to explore London.  Anything you need is catered for, even down to the choice of music in the lounge when we'd had a bit too much Michael Buble!!  We had a wonderful, relaxing Christmas and will definitely be back again!"
December 2012,What a treat,"Stayed at 41 between Christmas and New Year's Day.  The hotel was wonderful!  The location perfect.  The staff could not have made our stay any less stressful, and planned every outing with care.  On New Year's Eve we saw Mama Mia, and Lauren suggested that they arrange transportation via private car back to the hotel.  We thought that might be unnecessary.  How hard could it be?  Turns out it was very necessary, as central London was CLOSED, and the car and driver made getting through what was essentially a blocked off area a piece of cake.  Nice work.  A small gem of a retreat in a very large city proved to be our hideaway.  We'd go back in a second."
October 2012,A superb hotel and wonderful staff,"So many good things to say about the staff and this hotel. We found the rooms to be well appointed, clean and very nicely finished. The staff made us very welcome and the little extras made our short stay very enjoyable. The hotel had a classy feel with a relaxed atmosphere and I would recommend this hotel to anyone. It's not cheap but worth every penny "
December 2012,BEST HONEYMOON (and hotel) EVER!!!,"Upon arrival at Hotel 41 we were greeted warmly in the lobby with Champagne followed by a greeting by the concierge who escorted us to the exec. lounge to check in. The concierge reviewed a preferences form that was emailed to us 2-3 days prior and which was used to book restaurant reservations and book tickets for a show.  We then were escorted to our rooms for a tour, which to our surprise was upgraded as a compliment because we were on our honeymoon.    In our room were beverages of our liking taken again from the preferences form.  The rooms were very elegant but not overdone and there were small, thoughtful extras for added convenience such as:  a fully stocked desk, dental kits, heated towel racks, and the famous “Whatever Whenever” button.  When we thought our initial…"
December 2012,The Best Hotel In London,"This hotel is probably the best hotel I have stayed in. Everything is perfect! From the personable service where nothing is too much, to the outstanding decor there is not one thing I would change. What it lacks in facilities (gym, pool, spa) it makes up for in feeling like you are part of an elite members club.  The resident manager Lauren was delightful. Thoroughly recommended. "
December 2012,The best hotel I have ever stayed in,"Warm and friendly staff, excellent service, and personal attention were all combined to make this a really memorable and special stay. I could not recommend this hotel more highly. The staff were willing to help with anything. We stayed in the conservatory suite...a bit pricey, but really really nice, and definitely worth a visit if you are in London for a special occasion."
December 2012,One of the finest hotels I have ever visited,"I want to begin by saying that I own a hotel in Florida. I wish that my establishment could boast of the same exceptionally trained staff as the 41! What absolute pleasure from the moment we arrived. The staff is so remarkably pleasant and helpful. The facility, although lacking in amenities like spas and gyms, is brilliantly appointed. The rooms were clean, spotless, and tastefully decorated. Little things like champaign and turndown service allow this property to be every bit as classy and elegant as a Four Seasons type hotel.  If I were a nicer boss, I would send my staff to the 41 to learn how it feels to be treated like royalty. I will stay at the 41 each time I visit London."
October 2012,Simply wonderful and the best service I've encountered,"I have been instructed by my wife not to put a review on for this hotel as it may restrict our ability to book again next year!  This is a perfect hotel for a short stay in London.  The quality and attentiveness of the staff is exemplary from that first glass of champagne in the library on arrival to a farewell drink even after you've checked out.  The rooms are cosy and well furnished to a very high level.  It is also in a great location, a 5 minute walk from Victoria station and a 15 minute walk from Harrods.  We will definitely try to have our pre-Xmas stay in London here in 2013.  Cost wise it's expensive but not excessively for London and it's still good value."
December 2012,Lovely! I would recommend this hotel to anyone.,"While not the most opulent hotel ever, hotel 41 is one of my favorite hotels in the entire world. It is tiny- but that translates into personalized and attentive service. I truly felt as if the staff was there to assist me with my Every need. For example, when I arrived, I was freaking out because I had just discovered hat my laptop did not have a cd rom drive. Within 5 minutes of checking in, they brought a brand new, loaner laptop to my room (with the requires cd rom).   The rooms were also super cute- each is a compact suite with a fireplace. The bathrooms are also fantastic- I can't remember a hotel with a stronger and hotter shower.   Needless to say, I will definitely return "
January 2013,Excellent!,"We stayed during December for two nights. Great hotel, great stuff, great attention to details!                                                                     Location is ok, not great...but it is what it is. Love the design, the ambiance, the service. Will definitely stay again."
December 2012,Tailor made 30th birthday treat - brilliant,"I wanted to organise a treat for my boyfriends 30th in January and started planning in November. Hotel 41 were brilliant, especially Monika who helped me decide on what treats I wanted in the room especially the more demanding ones such as 'please find me a room with a TV near the bed' and 'i want these dvd's in the room, can you find them?'. Completely accommodating with no fuss. Offered lovely romantic treats that was still within my budget.  Dinner was excellent and we ate in the lounge -  a lovely cosy lounge, wall to ceiling with books, dark wood and a fireplace. Honesty bar, complimentary sweets and ice cream...  GOrgeous cosy rooms, remote controlled fireplaces and excellent staff. Can't fault it at all.  If you're looing for opulence and grandeur, ornate decor and fancy…"
January 2013,Blissful as always,"I've stayed here before and it's a delightful oasis of calm in a busy noisy city.  I continue to be impressed by the little touches - such as coming in to have a lovely warm lit fire on a freezing cold night and hot water bottles in the beds! I was staying with my mum and she was over the moon about that, plus the fact the slippers were in His & Hers bags, but because they knew it was myself and my mum they put in two Hers instead - it's just so thoughtful.  The staff as always are super-attentive and really pleasant, genuinely nice people and lovely to chat to.  Lauren the Resident Manager had a lovely natter to us over breakfast and made sure we had absolutely everything we needed - we couldn't think of anything to make it a better stay. Thanks to Lauren and everyone working…"
December 2012,Fantastic service and location,"Staying at the 41 Hotel is an amazing experience. From the moment the door was opened for we have been pampered in a trully fantastic way. The location, rooms and facilities are outstanding. If you ever want to experience what true hospitality is al about you should come over to the lovely hidden gem opposite Buckingham Palace"
December 2012,Best Hotel I have ever stayed in London,"The words, professional come to mind as do comfortable, exclusive, well thought out, excellent breakfast, comfortable rooms that are well stocked of all those little things that make a trip just a little more special. Service was excellent with lots of people to customer ratio. I had breakfast there twice and some snacks both excellent quality with high service levels. The free ice cream was a nice touch even though it was cold outside we could not resist. We asked for Transport from airports as I was also on business and this was handled professionally as well. A great hotel to stay in London for business or pleasure. I have paid a lot more in other places and got much much less.   What did they get wrong, only one thing, after Check out I got charged for food that we could not…"
January 2013,An unforgettable stay,"Myself and my husband stayed at Hotel 41 over the festive period. I would just like to say...this hotel is wonderful. The attention to detail is unbelievable. Before I had even finished my last sip of champagne, a fresh ice cold glass had been offered to me. I never had to lift a finger, anything you could possibly want was already there before you had even thought of it. I particularly liked the 'whatever whenever' button on the telephone which was an excellent touch.  The staff were fantastic and really took the time to get to know you. The girls in the lobby were extremely helpful. Amanda arranged our whole evening for us and booked us a table at Santinis which was delicious (would also recommend). The whole style of service and decor of the hotel was exactly what we were…"
January 2013,excellent hotel,"We fully enjoyed the ""English club"" aspect;service is excellent.The room was very well equipped,though a little small for the cost. The shower door did not close properly and the shower system(with enormous water pressure) would certainly require being changed. So excellent,but not perfect...."
January 2013,As good as the last time,I agree with a previous reviewer - rarely is something/somewhere as good as the first experience (a one night stay for my birthday) but Hotel 41 did not disappoint. My husband and I had originally booked a two night stay for his birthday but unfortunately had to cancel the first night due to the weather conditions. However we made it for the second night and like other returning guests were greeted like old friends by the staff. Somehow they manage to make you feel special without it feeling creepy. Everyone seems to be smiling at Hotel 41 from the staff to the other guests. It may not be the most luxurious hotel in London (and I have no personal frame of reference) but maybe that is part of its charm. It is luxurious enough but without making you feel out of your depth and…
January 2013,Something a little extra special...,"This was a little bit of time away from the life of being mummy and daddy. A midweek overnight stay in London to see Mathew Bourne's Sleeping Beauty, as a Christmas treat for my wife. Hotel 41 has a great location (opposite the Royal Mews) and is only a few minutes stroll from Victoria. The hotel is right next door to The Rubens, its sister hotel (it's actually the 5th floor of The Rubens that has been made up into a small boutique, exec club-style hotel) and you're greeted by a concierge in the small discreet downstairs lobby. I arrived before my wife, as she works in central London, and tried to check in. As my wife had made the arrangements I had little or no details with me. Unfortunately there was no record of our booking (unkown as to where the blame lies) however the…"
January 2013,Just... AMAZING!!,Maybe the best hotel i ever been!!!! I traveled here in the start of January for business with my company and i really loved this place!! Its a bit expensive for me but who cares... my company paid and i am glad i experienced the beauty and comfort of this hotel!! The rooms and the service are beyond any expectation!! Totally recommended to all!!!
January 2013,Service ...exceptional,I had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41.  The staff could be the best trained in terms of customer service I've seen in a long time.  They secured all my site seeing visits with detailed printouts as well as handling all the phone calls and set up all my reservations.  Never once did anyone appear impatient ... first class and above and beyond.  Superb.
January 2013,This is how to do special!,"Whether its because of the personal attention of the staff, the very highest quality of furnishings, food and drink this truly is a wonderful hotel experience. Nothing is to much trouble for this top team and I would like to thank each and every one of them for making my wife's 50th birthday treat this weekend so memorable. "
January 2013,Amongst the best hotels in the world,"We have just returned from another visit to Hotel 41. Often whenever you have a good expierience initially and you go back somewhere you have very special memories of, you can feel its not quite as good as you remember. We certainly did not have that feeling going back to Hotel 41. If anything our expectations were surpassed which was extremely difficult considering how good it was the first time. Many of your reviewers comment of the luxury and the attention to detail and 41 has all of those things but staying gives you so much more. We feel we are welcomed back as friends and not in an over the top way but in a genuine, we really care you have come back, way. Our words cannot do this hotel justice, absolutely first class in every way."
January 2013,THE QUINTESSENTIAL HOME FROM HOME,"If you are looking for an intimate home from home experience this hotel is at the top of my list.  My wife and I both spent 3nights at this superb establishment within a week of each other this January and were unanimous in our delight. Quite simply this small delightful 5 star residence sets out to provide a luxurious, and intimate environment and succeeds admirably having paid attention to every little detail. Wonderful liveried staff provided exacting service by anticipating my needs and rendering help in a thoughtful and totally unpretentious way. Welcomed on an a freezing January day with a glass of good French champagne in front of a fire in a comfortable finely appointed reception and lounge area, I was escorted to my room to be carefully given the details of the…"
January 2013,Attention to Detail and service - second to none!,A gorgeous little gem of a hotel - Service was absolutely impeccable and such a refreshing change for London. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. My husband and I were made to feel like royalty rather than paying guests. I won't go into detail about all the thoughtful little touches in the bedroom or plunder the pantry etc. as it has all been said before on trip advisor. It is however all completely true and the many 5 star reviews thoroughly deserved. If you are thinking of booking this hotel don't think about it just do it - you will not be left disappointed.
January 2013,star manager and customer service team,"There are not enough stars in the Tripadvisor rating system to express the excellent customer service that I received at this hotel during a recent stay.  I’ve stayed at many great hotels all over the world (Shangri-La, Raffles, The Four Seasons, Monasterio, etc.) but have never, ever experienced this level of care and customer service excellence. Right after you book, the hotel sends you a questionnaire, in which you can request a special pillow from a very extensive menu (e.g., foam/feather, aromatherapy, triangular?, many others), book spa treatments, make restaurant reservations, and make other requests (e.g., a free yoga mat and DVD, an exercise bike brought to your room!).  I asked for the yoga mat and DVD and for the bike, and both were waiting for me when I arrived. …"
December 2012,Heavenly!,"My partner and I stayed at the glorious Hotel 41 for 3 nights in December and I can't even begin to say how truly wonderful it was.  On arrival the complimentary glass of champagne was very well received. Our room was perfect in every way and the attention to detail is amazing.One of the tests of a good hotel is the ability for me to be able to put on my make up with a decent light,something that is sadly lacking in most hotels but Hotel 41 came up trumps yet again with the perfect mirror and light. Everything, but everything has been thought of with the tiniest detail catered for. On my partner's birthday there was a delicious birthday cake and bottle of champagne awaiting us and the Romantic turn down was just right. We have stayed in hotels all over the world and this is the…"
December 2012,"41, a perfect stay","This has to be my favourite hotel of all time. Fantastic service, beautiful rooms and it feels like home from home.  The staff are just so friendly and helpful with nothing to much trouble.   Owned by the Red Carnation group this hotel is just across the road from Buckingham Palace. If you come to Guernsey try the OGH hotel which they also own and is now the Islands only 5 star accommodation .   Thanks for a lovely stay Vikki and I will be back soon :)"
December 2012,"Lovely hotel, excellent location","My husband, daughter and myself stayed at Hotel 41 on Christmas Day. We had a wonderful stay, our king room was spacious and very homely. There was a bath and separate shower cubicle, the water pressure was really good with the deep bath filling in no time at all and the shower extremely powerful. The bathrobe was the most comfortable I have ever worn.  The bed was very comfortable and the round the clock snacks were very welcome :)  The only thing that could be improved upon is the TV, is seems very old and had lines across the screen, it didn't bother us too much though.  The room service menu is extensive, we tried the gnocchi and the chips which were both very good.  As it was our wedding anniversary we received a beautiful cake which was very tasty :) I would highly…"
December 2012,"Wonderful hotel - warm, thoughtful and professional staff","From the moment we arrived the staff looked after us and everything we needed. They remembered what we were doing and even went to great lengths to provide the little finishing touches to ensure our experience was just that much better. They were ready to book tours, get tickets for shows, offer advice for ""how to get to..."" and anything else we needed. Rooms were well appointed and quiet. Location was fantastic. And I have never had better service than at Hotel 41 (and I have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world); and the afternoon tea is worth having (make sure you're hungry). I would have stayed longer if I could   This will definitely be my hotel of choice for all my future visits to London."
November 2012,Perhaps i read too much on trip advisor!,My wife and I stayed for two nights for our 10 wedding anniversary and from the moment we walked through the doors the amazing customer service began. We were a little early so while we checked in and waited for our room to prepared we were offered a complementary glass on champagne and nibbles. The room was immaculately clean and big enough for the two of us.  We had breakfast both morning and I'd highly recommend the full English.  Overall the hotel and staff were so amazing and really helped make our weekend unforgettable and well deserve they're number 1 status on here! See you next year!!
December 2012,Lost for words,Overall a pleasant 2 night stay but perhaps reading so many glowing reports left me a little disappointed.  No birthday cake for my husband as like so many other reviewers. No romantic turndown as stated on my third party reservation form. The staff are a credit to the hotel. The setting perfect to explore central London but in this case trip advisor may have been their downfall. 
December 2012,Truly a 5 star boutique hotel in London!,"I booked this hotel for one night for my partners 24th birthday.  words can not describe how much the staff do for you here, they made my partners birthday the best!   we was upgraded to a split level suite! lost for words! the room was lovely! after we arrived back from dinner we entered our room to find the lights dimmed with music playing rose petals up the stairs and a plate filled with chocolate covered strawberries with happy birthday written on it.  In this hotel nothing is a problem the staff will do anything to make your stay as comfortable as possible, you feel so at home here!  the plunder the pantry is a lovely idea your free to get yourself a late snack or pot of ice cream, another example of how at home they make you feel here!  will definitely be back for future…"
July 2012,I AM STARTING TO LIKE LONDON,"We stayed at Hotel 41 over the New years Eve Holiday (12/29-1/2/2013) and from the our first step into the hotel until we left everything was superb and service was impeccable! Although you enter on the street level the hotel is really all on the 5th floor. We were instantly greeted by staff and then the assisatnt manager came down to greet us and take us up to the 5th floor where the executive lounge and the hotel rooms are all located. We arrived at 11:30AM on saturday morning (overnight trip from USA). Our room was not ready as we expected since it was only 11:30AM. However Monica , the assistant manager, offered us a ""temporary"" room where we could shower and relax until our junior suite was ready. This was completely unepxected but we gladly accepted the offer. They did not…"
January 2013,Excellent,"I usually do not like London but when I stayed at the Hotel 41 the first time my perspective changed. I love the traditional English hospitality combined with the top notch service. Hotel 41 makes you feel you are at a country club with fabulous staff. The location is also very convenient - right next to Hyde Park, you can get around easily. I have been back to London a few times and made sure to come back to Hotel 41."
December 2012,What an amazing hotel,"Spent two nights here and found it to be a wonderful place to stay. The staff are exceptionally helpful and friendly, as well as being very proud of where they work which indeed they should be. Well worth making Hotel 41 a place to visit for that special weekend."
October 2012,Wonderful service--they really care about their customers,"Outstanding reception, crisp attention to detail, comfortable beds/rooms, and useful sightseeing tips!  My family visited London for the first time and we were so pleased with the hotel location and superb staff.  The Hotel 41 added so much to our overall ""tourist""  experience!  The staff arranged for us to see The Lion King at the Lyceum--excellent balcony seats with a clear view.  All meals we ate at the hotel were served hot and we thought they were delicious.  We were so comfortable that it was hard to leave.  What a restful, warm, and much needed break!"
December 2012,Best service anywhere,"The decor is a little bit like staying in a Winston Churchill museum which is a taste thing, but I'll tell you this - you won't find more attentive, personal service anywhere.  I actually got homesick after leaving this hotel!  It starts with Breakfast in a lovely library-like setting.  This is where it all centers.  The concierge is in the Library.  There are always something interesting to nibble on in the presentation display.  Small refrigerators hold a collection of soft drinks and waters.  Meals are also served there, and I had an awesome steak right next to the fireplace.  This is not an expansive property, there are not a lot of rooms (which is great!) so it is very homey.  They take care of everything."
November 2012,Magical Place,"What an amazing hotel. It is beautifully run and nothing is ever too much for the more than able hotel staff. This is our second visit to this hotel and we will most certainly be back again soon. Where else can you say you were greeted in London with a smile and beautiful glass of champagne on arrival. The rooms although a little on the small side are perfectly situated and you hear nothing from the other rooms at all, which is unusual with most new hotels these days. Bravo to all the staff for another superb stay.... We will be back."
November 2012,Lovely Day in Chelsea,I had a long overnight layover flying through Heathrow so I decided to get a room and picked Hotel 41 based off the reviews.   This is a very quaint property just a block from Victoria Station. I wish I had more time to explore as I hadn't been in London in 25 years. I was able to go out the next day before my flight and walk through Chelsea and the Sloane Square area on a nice but damp fall day.   The hotel staff were very courteous and helpful  and the room was spacious but they did upgrade me to a suite. The suite did seem to have one too many (3) bathrooms for its size but the rooms weren't big enough for anything else. The hallways are narrow and the hotel is a bit of a maze but that adds to the charm for me. It is across the street from the Royal Horse Guards barracks so I…
November 2012,Pure joy,"Stayed at this fantastic property 2 weeks ago, when shopping in London. From the moment you enter a small lobby to check in with a glass of champagne upstairs - they make you feel like you are back home. Black and white theme - very nice. Room was rather small but I was away most of the day. Bed - so comfortable I had problems getting up! Room - spotless. Amenities - delightful. Food - delicious. Service - exceptional. A few names to mention. Monica - very attentive and confident young lady was fun to chat with. Magda - her smile made me feel most welcome everytime I was around. Victoria - very polite and professional. She remembered my favourite way of drinking tea and I was quite impressed! As I could see the hotel was very busy she made me feel like I was the most important…"
September 2012,Paradise in the heart of London,"Simply the best hotel experience of a lifetime of travel. The concept of service, support and loft living works well to make the experience hassle free. Raid the pantry after a long day in London was an anticipated event. The staff was there to make your stay effortless. It cannot be improved on."
November 2012,Best Hotel Experience Ever!,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel 41 in late September 2012.  We traveled from LA to London to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary and booked three nights.  The class of service is unlike any other experience I've ever had at a hotel.  There are only a few dozen rooms in the hotel, which allows the front desk staff to treat each guest as if they were the only guest there.  The staff were friendly, helpful, and would work extremely hard to satisfy whatever need or request my wife and I might have.  We felt like we were leaving friends we had spent time vacationing with when it was time to check out.  It's located in central London, adjacent to the grounds of Buckingham Palace, a short walk to the Victoria tube station, and walking distance to Parliament, Big Ben, and…"
December 2012,A most excellent stay,"My husband and I stay here in late October and early November for a week on the recommendation of our trusted travel agent. We loved the hotel.  The location was very convenient yet out of much of the London hub bub.  It is very small with all the rooms located on the 5th floor. A very attentive staff always tried to go the extra mile for any requests and always remembered our names and asked after our day. Our package included breakfast in the comfy library/reception area.  It was always delicious.  Food was available in a small area off to the side most times of the day and night as well as a well stocked honor bar. Our room  was extremely well laid out and comfortable, but had no view at all. The bathroom was long and thin with an excellent soaking tub and a stall shower that…"
December 2012,The Unknown Secret in London,"I have been staying at 41 for a number of years on business and vacation. I have found the location excellent with easy access to London being right across from Buckingham Palace and just around the corner to Paddington station. The staff here is excellent and always available to assist with resturant recommendations, reservations and I have found that in between meetings I can work in the 41 lounge, they always remember my name even when it is a few months between my visits. If you are looking for a unique 5 star experience with excellent service in a great location Hotel 41 is an excellent choice. You will not be dissapointed."
October 2012,"Fantastic, friendly intimate","What else can I say, I have never stayed in such a top class hotel that had such a comfortable atmosphere. The staff are the best staff I have ever had the good fortune to meet, they always remembered our names and were truly interested in what we had been doing on our days out and about. We stayed in The Monarch suite and it was nice that it had a seperate living room so I could get up early watch tv and make a cup of tea without disturbing my husband. There is no resturant but they do have a plunder the pantry were they provide snacks ect that are complimentary. I think they change the food 3 times a day, so it was nice to come in from a shopping trip and have scones with jam and cream. There was always what I would consider a good selection, crisps, cold meats fresh fruit,…"
December 2012,great small hotel,"Spent 7 nights here in October '12--small hotel several blocks from Buckingham Palace.  All rooms on the 5th floor--no voew but nice rooms.  The best thing is the staff-absolutely fantastic.  They have large ""lounge"" tha is decorated like a British men's club--breakfast is served there daily with superb service and cooked to order eggs ets.  In the evening (after 8:30) they put out a large buffet of ""snacks""--much food.  There is a person on duty in the lounge 24/7 for making reservations, answering questions etc. Will stay again should we decide to go bak to London."
December 2012,Like no other!,"I have never been one to stay in small, intimate hotels nor relatively obscure branded properties. But, I learned how wrong  and misguided I've been during a most special trip to London.  This I the best place, with the most amazing staff, I have ever stayed. There is no close second.  To have a large, modern equipped room in a small, intimate hotel in London is quite atypical.  To discover such space accompanied by impeccable service from extraordinarily talented, accommodating and beautiful staff, however, makes it even more special and unique.  Hotel 41, with service, quality and comfortable accommodations that surpass expectations, has been so much more than expected that I felt I had to write about it.  Need theater tickets? They'll print them. Need ""tube"" directions?…"
December 2012,Wow!,"I am currently lying on my bed in my room here in Hotel 41 and had to write a review.   This place is fabulous.  Arriving yesterday after a very long week of traveling throughout Europe, I was greeted by a smile and a glass of champagne, then shown to my room which is sizable by European standards and immaculately furnished.  The service here could not be any better.  Everyone is so nice, whether it be for breakfast, lunch, room service, helping me mail something to relatives elsewhere in England, or providing assistance with a business meeting.  This is a very small hotel with only 20 rooms, I believe, so all the staff seem to know me by name even though i haven't seen or talked to all of them previously.  The hotel is ideally located, and has a very discrete entrance.  After…"
August 2012,xmas break with the children,"My  children Eleanor (9) , Charlie (5) and myself arrived late on Saturday evening having travelled down from Lincolnshire.    As indicated in other reviews the greeting was excellent and the immediate interraction with the children was fantastic. This interraction lasted throughout  the stay with every member of staff making them feel special  The room was laid out as requested and they had a couple of gifts for the children in the room  which was a very nice touch.  Also during our stay the a christmas fairy visited again leaving something for the children  The staff are truely brilliant and nothing is too much trouble.    For my family and myself the experience of 41 deservers the Excellent rating across the board.  We will hopefully be returning next year during the school…"
February 2013,Unique hotel,"A unique hotel with few peers. The Hotel 41 is a well-kept hotel and elegant. The rooms are spacious and tastefully furnished. the common areas are very nice, with a style that combines tradition and modernity. Also good breakfast. Good location."
December 2012,It really does live up to the hype!,"Having read all these gushingly enthusiastic reviews, I couldn't help worrying that it might not be possible for our our Valentine's night away to live up to expectations. How wrong can you be?! That a hotel can generate such high expectations and still surpass them says it all! I won't repeat what everyone else has said except to say that the genuine, personal concern of the staff for each and every guest is what makes this such an enjoyable experience. Well done, and roll on the next excuse to stay at Hotel 41!"
January 2013,The best little secret,I booked this hotel myself for Xmas week and was so overwhelmed by the staff and everything surrounding us....our suite..the lounge..I can't think of anything that was missed. It as such a joy. Like a home away from home.  The staff was superb and they made us feel so special that we'd never stay anywhere else.
January 2013,Excellent experience!,"My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in January of 2013.  As it was our first visit to London, we could not have chosen a better place to stay.  We arrived early from our flight from the U.S. and they met us so graciously and immediately put us in a temporary room until our room was ready (less than one hour).  The Staff from the receptionist to the concierge, the waiters and waitresses could not have been more friendly and helpful.  Our stay at Hotel 41 was so great! We would highly recommend this Hotel.  Mr and Mrs Scott Santa Fe, New Mexico"
February 2013,every service detail spot on- BUT needs an interior designer,"management has this team so focused on customer satisfaction its quite something to witness.  you'll read many reviews that expound on it.  however, overall interior design is amateurish, reminiscent of a mid-priced Victorian hotel from 20 years ago.  frumpy printed carpet in the lobby, heavy Victorian furnishings, and although there are windows you'll never be drawn to look out of them they're buried somewhere under all those window coverings and behind over-sized furniture.  flat screen tvs in an armoire ? what year is this?  too much furniture in general in the rooms and so many directories you can't work at the desk.  i never did see what was outside my small window, it was covered with a sheer-yes i said sheer-, a very heavy Roman shade, AND curtains.  i knew there were…"
January 2013,Best Hotel in London !!,"I have been fortunate enough to stay in some of the best hotels in London but Hotel 41 is in a class of its own. A wonderful hotel, with delightful staff and many individual touches that really set itself apart from others in the 5 star category. I felt totally relaxed and enjoyed every moment of my stay. There were so many little details that made it so special,  the complimentary glass of champagne at check in, the hot water bottle in bed, free icecream and bottles of water and plunder the pantry (a lovely array of snacks available in the lounge all day long) The lounge is the real hub of the hotel, a beautiful room where you breakfast, have afternoon tea, enjoy evening cocktails and canapes. My husband and I sat by the fire one evening after dinner with a glass of baileys -…"
January 2013,No way!,So...if this hotel does not meet your expectations...you need to stay home! Every detail is looked after and more. I think the rest of the reviews say it all. Best of the best :-) and make sure to let them do turndown service. Lots of nice surprises there. 
December 2012,Lauren's the best. But so are all the other staff.,"What to say? The best hotel in London and possibly the world. Boutique-heaven and lovely, charming staff. Can't wait to get back to this little gem. Note that they do seem to have one room with a slightly lower-than-expected ceiling. If you get that particular room, ask for a different one."
January 2013,Beyond Expectations,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 in December of 2012.  From the moment we walked in the door, we received the best service.  The staff is small, but after a few days you feel like they're family.  I knew all of their names by the time we left, and they always knew my name.  I looked forward to unwinding in the beautiful Executive Lounge after long days of sightseeing.  Anything we asked of them was delivered.  My flat iron bit the dust in Paris, and I happened to mention it to them.  They actually had one in the hotel I was able to use.  The turn down service with rose petals and candles all over the room was such a treat to come home to on our first night.  I cannot compliment the staff, service or hotel enough.  I will say for those of you who have to run each day like my…"
January 2013,Amazing hidden gem,"We were met with a warm welcome at hotel 41, 2 glasses of champagne and nibbles whilst waiting for our room. We were upgraded to a king size room which was lovely with fire and fireplace, fully stocked mini bar, tv and tea and coffee making facilities. Bathroom had many little extras, large bath with overhead shower and separate shower aswell. Loved the complimentary choccies too! We'd definitely stay again we were made to feel so welcome and special!"
November 2012,Once again our expectations are met,"Hotel 41 once again delivered ourstanding service, superb accommodation  and excellent food in the Executive Lounge for breakfast and for dinner in The Library of their sister hotel next door. Bedrooms and bathrooms are of a high quality and all staff most attentive and helpful. Look forward to our next visit."
November 2012,Wow. What a great place to stay,"A glass of Laurent Perrier at check in was the start of a wonderful stay. There is not a single thing I could criticise about the hotel. Beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, comfortable bedding and very tasty breakfast. But the best bit of the whole place is the wonderful staff. Everyone we met at the hotel made us feel like royalty. Treat yourself...... Stay at 41"
November 2012,Excellent Stay,"Was in London on an overnight for business- Everything from the service, the room and the location was superb. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is traveling in London and wants the taste of pure luxury. I will stay here again if I am in town for buisness again- thank you to the hotel 41 staff for being such splendid hosts!"
November 2012,Best Hotel in London...........,"I arrived late on a Saturday afternoon. The hotel is situated in a discrete location & I liked that immediately. In the reception room I was greeted by a very attentive staff member tendering to all my needs. I was lead up to the Executive Lounge  for checking in & the customary glass of champagne - perfect start to the evening -   The Executive King Room is clean, spacious & bathroom. What I especially liked was the little touches of when I entered the room, there was a greetings card & chocolates their to greet me.  I was more than happy with the professional staff as they made my experience of Hotel 41, a time to remember.  I look forward to my return to your hotel in 2013"
November 2012,4 Days at the 41 in London,"Hotel 41 is a a quaint hotel with impeccable service and attention to detail. The staff are incredibly friendly, helpful, and professional. Turn down service included chocolates, classical music, and the fireplace on. My only issue was the lack of space in the sleeping area. We were in a junior suite on 2 floors and the desk was right beside the bed. Not only did this make the bedroom area difficult to walk around in, but trying to work while my wife was sleeping was not possible. Certainly not a complaint-but my suggestion would be to move the desk downstairs to the sitting area which would provide more room in the bedroom and would also allow guests to  utilize the downstairs sitting room more. Overall though we were thrilled with our time at the 41 and would highly recommend…"
October 2012,Hidden luxury,"A discrete entrance near Buckingham Palace Road and Victoria St. welcomes you to an exquisite boutique hotel that without a doubt it will be my #1 place of choice from here on out. The room was well designed, the bed was uber comfortable, the room amenities were top-notch and the location convenient to business areas and tourist sites. The availability of complimentary breakfast and snacks in the executive lounge was a welcomed convenience to a weary traveler with days full of business meetings, and the quality of the food was superb. The hotel was quiet, warm, beautiful and welcoming.  Beyond all that, however, the single best part about this lovely hotel was the staff.  Without exception, each was incredibly kind and completely focused on customer satisfaction. You could tell…"
November 2012,Relaxing weekend in fabulous surroundings,"A wonderful stay in this luxurious hotel where nothing is too much trouble. It is well placed being near Buckingham Palace and in easy reach of other interesting places to visit. The resident manager Lauran Hargrave and her team gave us a friendly welcome on arriving in the executive lounge.  Every detail was thought of during our stay, the staff are knowledgeable and showed interest in our activities while in London. The chocolate cake to celebrate my birthday was a very much appreciated example of the effort made to provide a happy weekend for us. The weekend was topped off with a wonderful Champagne tea in the lounge, the pastry chef excelled as usual. Really enjoyable relaxing weekend, a great experience once again and looking forward to returning."
November 2012,Fabulous weekend break..special Birthday,"Myself and my wife have just spent a long weekend at this excellent hotel. The location, decor, comfort and A1 service is by far the best we have received in a long time, in this beautiful city. The staff could not do enough for us. From the minute we arrived we were look after in an Excellent, friendly, and caring way. Top team service from all team members. Thanks for such a great experience and looking forward to visiting again in the new year.  Jeff and Tracy"
November 2012,Possibly the best hotel in England...,"My wonderful new wife and I stayed at Hotel 41 very recently to have a celebratory weekend in London. Having stayed at 41 a number of times previously, the bench had been set in terms of standards/service etc. and it's the true mark of a great hotel that can consistently deliver on this: Hotel 41 does this, without exception.  The staff were exceptional (for example, my wife was unfortunately ill on the Friday night, meaning we had to cancel our dinner reservations at a 'quite hard to book' restaurant. We ended up staying another night at 41 as it really is that good, and the wonderful resident manager Lauren managed to get us a reservation at the same restaurant for Saturday night....no mean feat by any stretch!) There's an unwritten motto at 41 which is unfortunately becoming…"
November 2012,For the Royal Treatment in London stay at Hotel 41!,"We just spent a week in London, staying at the Hotel 41.  From the first contact at arrival to the amenities in our suite and executive lounge, everything was top notch.  The very personal service from all of the staff made us feel truly welcome.  We were always greeted by our name.  We loved relaxing in the executive lounge with our cappuccinos in the morning and pink champagne in the evening.The location enabled us to walk to many attractions and restaurants, which were well recommended by the staff.  It was always nice to come back to our room after dinner to find our bed turned down, the fireplace lit, the sterio quietly playing classical music, candles lit in the bathroom  ... it was all of the little touches that made our experience so great!  We look forward to going back!"
October 2012,Amazing hotel in the heart of London!,"What an amazing hotel. As the other reviews state, the service is unbeatable.  My husband and I stayed here for three nights and weren't ready to leave when we did.  Check In - Complimentary champagne with arrival along with a great overview of the hotel and amenities.  The staff also checks in to see if they can help with any travel planning while you are there. My husband plans everything so we didn't need much help but they helped with transportation and gave a thumbs up to his choices.  Room - We stayed in a junior suite that comprised of two levels.  The lower level was small but comfortable and had a lovely fireplace.  The upstairs had a desk, closet, bedroom and bath.  It wasn't large but was very comfortable.  Attention to detail has been paid to the rooms.  Anything you…"
November 2012,Hats off to Hotel 41,"Wonderful boutique hotel, fantastic staff headed by resident manager, Lauren Hargrave, personal email before trip from Janine Malia, Hotel 41 customer service manager asking if she could be of service prior to our visit.  The hotel and staff were one of the high points of our trip.  They were knowledgeable, helpful, welcoming, and made one feel like a VIP to be pleased.  What a find and I guess we are not the only ones who love this place.  Soon, it will be difficult to book a room.  We are happy to have spent 6 days with these gracious hosts."
October 2012,best hotel experience ever,"We spent a night in London at the end of our honeymoon.  When we entered from the main door we were greeted by our name even before introducing ourselves.  Check-in and welcome was as smooth as ever.  Room was very luxurious and very nicely decorated, also with a working fireplace.  Service and staff attitude was beyond excellent.  Location is very very close to Victoria station and Buckingham palace.  I am not an expert of London but I believe this is a very central and convenient location.  I highly suggest for honeymooners.  When we came back at night, the fireplace was on, rose petals and candles eveywhere, a very delicious congratulations case etc. etc."
November 2012,What an unexpected surprise,to find such a place in London. Hotel 41 offers everything and more from the super friendly staff upto the amazing service everything is done better then what you expect. For example our little log fire and the splendid breakfast. Next time London I know what to book.
September 2012,Birthday trip,"I stayed here for two nights in 2011. Staying here as a great experience. I remembered that I got a DVD from the lobby one night and a friendly staff brought popcorn to my room later. Great location, elegant decoration, stunning room and friendly staff."
October 2012,Best part of our trip,"After a 5-week trip around Europe, my wife and I decided to change our existing reservation in Notting Hill and go a little luxe for our stay in London. We found 41 absolutely amazing from the staff, the decor, the food and the service - everything was exemplary.   While we had booked most of our tickets and dinner reservations the staff were always more than helpful - even when we extended our stay to 6 nights from the original 3 nights.  Unfortunately we won't be back there anytime soon (we live in Australia) but would recommend it to anyone."
October 2012,"At Your Service,","My husband and I decided to book Hotel 41 after it being suggested from a frequent traveller not realizing this was #1 on TA.  It was our 25th anniversary and so I tried not let the price interfere with making special arrangements.  Prior to our arrival Hotel 41 emailed us to have us fill out a personal preference form...some were no fee and some of the services were at a cost.  The form was not easy to use on the computer and it took a couple of tries to submit it, when I told them about this they had apologized and compensated us with a bottle of champagne on arrival.  We also had rose petals and a chocolate cake in our room. We were spoiled here with the attention...the staff was so friendly and accommodating.  We miss our late nights with Peter!  We missed the executive…"
October 2012,Personal and enjoyable. Well done!,"The 41 Hotel is a great experience. From the reservation process to the check-out procedure we felt very taken care of at all times. I traveled with my two children (7, 10) and my girlfriend.  Check-in which is usually something to forget about was nothing but a pleasure. Hot chocolate was produced in minutes as a welcome drink for the girls. The lobby/lounge is tasteful and very relaxing. A bonus was to be able to spend an hour or two in front of the fireplace in the lounge which that has the resemblance of an old “library”.   My children loved that they could “plunder” the pantry and get  ice cream and fruits and dad loved that it is all complimentary. In the evening there is a selection of cold cuts and cheeses to choose from.    The staff´s just great. Friendly but…"
October 2012,Lovely staff,"This hotel is well located and the staff are very friendly and helpful although sometimes verging on too attentive! The rooms are lovely and comfortable and the first night we returned to find candles in the room and Rose petals on the floor, very romantic.  The rooms are small though. The breakfast was very good, eggs Benedict excellent, although service a little slow the second day."
October 2012,james scurrah reviews Hotel 41,"This hotel offers good value for money, nice old world charm that has been kept up to date the rooms are  great very clean and the staff are super friendly, i would recommend this Hotel to anyone visiting London I hope they maintain standard, they even booked our theater tickets"
November 2012,Excellent!,"A superb hotel with great location. The service is super good, the staff is excellent and it feels very ""friendly"". The staff fixed everything for us, like reservations at restaurans were it's extremly hard to get reservations etc..  I can really recommend this hotel!"
November 2012,An Hotel yes! But with all the comforts of an English Country Home,"From first contact, through booking, to arrival, attention to detail was exceptional, even to describing where to pull up the car, ""we'll unload sir and park the car for you, congestion charge paid sir?"" (I had done something!). Arrived slightly early, ""please take a seat sir, madam - champagne?"" Very pleasant!  We were courteously shown to our room, the door opened, my wife immediately burst into tears for I had requested the ""Romantically"" package, (see it to believe it.)  A quick change prior to the concierge booked car arriving exact to time, concert and return to a beautifully appointed Lounge offering complimentary self service buffet with a ""honesty tab"" for drinks plus staff on hand offering assistance.  We've all stayed in Hotels where the room phone has 101 extension…"
November 2012,Unsurpassed excellence,"Wow, what a wonderful hotel. Great location, fabulous design and flawless execution.   Location - turn right out of the front door and you are at the gates of Buckingham Palace within 3 minutes. Turn left, across 2 blocks into Victoria St and you have an 8 minute walk to Westminster.   Design - enter the narrow foyer, head for the lift and ascend to Level 5. The hotel takes up the entire top floor with the suites centred around the wonderfully warm and welcoming guest lounge. The top floor location allows for natural light to make its way into the lounge and guest suites via skylights. The black and white decor, against a backdrop of rich, red timbers and antique furnishings, works wonderfully - classy without being over the top.   Execution - 41's stated philosophy is ""no…"
July 2012,The best City Hotel,This without a doubt is the best City Hotel Ive ever stayed in.  It was just perfect nothing was too much trouble.    The lounge / bar area is just like being at home just help yourself too food and a drink in the evening and just relax. And to top it all the location is perfect.
October 2012,Amazing Hotel Keeps Getting Better,"Since my first review of the 41 in July 2010, I've had the pleasure of staying at the 41 two more times. I didn't think it was possible to improve on such a great hotel, but I found this stay to be even better than the last two.   The staff were, as always, quite attentive and delivered the highest quality service. What changed this time was the fare in the ""pantry""; it was more much more varied. There was a wider selection of cheeses, meats, breads, fruit, ice cream, and other interesting nibbles—all as part of the 41's ""plunder the pantry"" feature where guests can help themselves to a hearty snack each evening at no additional charge.   For additional details, see my review from July, 2010."
October 2012,A lifetime memory,"Booking a hotel is not always just a simple booking. This particular booking was to be the highlight of a surprise birthday celebration for my special person <3  The best way I can think of conveying our experience at Hotel 41 is to draw a parallel to Alice in wonderland. At Hotel 41, a mere 2 minute walk from Victoria station and not to mention Buckingham Palace, you are transported away from the busy streets of London into your very own Wonderland.  We had an early flight to London and as we arrived at the hotel at around 10:00, we simply planned to check-in, leave our luggage and relax in the lounge before heading out to lunch. We were not expecting the complimentary champagne, not to mention the fact that they were able to have our room ready as we took our last sip…"
November 2012,Service was over the top incredible!!,"Recently stayed for 4 nights at the Hotel 41 and was provided with not 5 star but 6+ star service. Having stayed at Four Seasons and Ritz Carltons I will say the service here is 2nd to none! The lounge air with butler service/quick drinks, professional conierge were outstanding. Only reason why I did not rate as 5 stars are the rooms are rather small and lack a view (at this price level a view should be part of package/realize the hotel is limited to location so just my 2 cents on subject). This hotel actually occupies the top floor of the Rubens next door (check prices there as well as it was beautiful hotel with afternoon tea) and has a seperate entrance. Taxi driver was confused, if coming in from airport the Rubens is actually a well known landmark and you should direct the…"
October 2012,"definitely worth the accolades, best value in London","I'm reluctant to add to the accolades offered to this hotel as it means it will probably be booked out next time I go to London.  However, the hard working and accommodating staff deserve recognition. I travelled with my teenage daughter who has experienced many 5 star hotels (Sofitels, Hyatts, Orient express group and Hiltons) on family holidays but after our champagne check in and exceptional service right from the front door, on entering the room she looked at me wide eyed and said ""can we afford this?"". I have to admit I was wondering the same, thinking that perhaps I had mistaken the rate! I quickly got onto the free wi fi to check.  This has to be the best value hotel in London. (On our previous trip together I had paid the same rate at The Russell only to experience…"
September 2012,Weekend Experience,This is a lovely and exclusive hotel easy to walk by without seeing and nicely tucked away.  The service there is always excellent and the staff are well informed about your arrival and pay attention to small details.  The room was nice and clean but the furniture too large for the room and it could be better designed.  But everything is spotlessly clean and well equipped.  We also enjoyed a fabulous champagne tea and the lounge in 41 is uniquely interesting and comfortable.  The pastries were superb.  The service five star. This hotel is very well placed being adjacent to Buckingham Palace and the staff extremely willing to help you find interesting things to do in the vicinity.  If they can make your stay more agreeable they look for ways to do so.  For example we had thewhole…
October 2012,The best service.,The small hotel located within another hotel had the most attentive staff and an excellent selection of well prepared food available at all times in the executive lounge. The room was well decorated but a bit crowded  with furniture but as I understand their intention is to renovate this room and combine it with the next room enlarging it. It is located a 3 min. walk to Buckingham Palace.
October 2012,Great hotel,"We stayed at Hotel 41 in October for a special birthday. The staff made us feel welcome from the moment we got there and throughout our stay. The glass of champagne was welcome after the journey to London.  The room was very clean and the pillow menu was interesting.   The afternoon tea was very nice as was the breakfast.    The staff had our theatre tickets ready and waiting and also booked our restaurant for us on the Saturday night.   The location was good for sightseeing, Buckingham Palace was just across the road, London Eye and Westminster were 10 minute walk away.   We had a fun few days and will return.  Great service, great staff and a great hotel."
October 2012,Perfection!,"Me and my wife stayed at Hotel 41 for one night on October 27th for our anniversary. Upon arrival we were greeted by very friendly staff and given a glass of Champagne each while we checked in. The Hotel and rooms are amazing. The flowers i had ordered before arriving were in the room along with the note i had asked for. The whole room is of a very high standard and attention has been paid to all the small details. With things like toothbrushes, sewing kits, shoe polish etc. For the evening i had requested a romantic turndown for when we returned from our night out and again it exceeded expectations. We arrived in the room to rose petals scattered throughout the room and in a heart shape on the bed, with Stawberrys covered in chocolate, romantic music playing, Candles, a single…"
October 2012,A world class hotel.,"Having stayed in countless hotels across Europe and US, this hotel stands out from the usual. The customer service was excellent and combination of location, room, cleanliness and food standard was exceptional. This hotel had figured out a business model that works and as long as they can maintain the standards they can expect repeat business. I'll certainly be back. Congratulations to management and staff on a world class hotel experience."
October 2012,A superior hotel experience,"It was a little worrying when our taxi driver from Kings Cross did not know the name of the hotel and at one point on Buckingham Palace road he asked another taxi driver.  Eventually he found ""41"" along side the Rubens Hotel and advised me ask for that hotel on future visits. He did not charge me for the extra mileage in his search but I overdid the tip to compensate for his honesty and his fuel.  My wife and I were met at the understated door (by London standards) by the doorman and cases put to one side. We were escorted into the lift and taken to the 5th floor where the hotel 41 is located.  Checking in was swift whilst luggage was taken to the room.  Champagne offered was a pleasant touch whilst the general information was expalned to us. Our room was clean,comfortably…"
October 2012,The finest hotel I have ever stayed in,"I suppose some people are used to living in such style but not me and this phenomenal hotel completely bowled me over. We arrived on a damp, drizzly October afternoon but Chris, the doorman/receptionist, gave us the warmest of welcomes as he ushered us into the hotel and pleasantly chatted about our journey. Then we were taken up to the executive lounge where we given a glass of very classy champagne and engaged in some banter with the French and Italian staff on duty. The deputy manager who signed us in was particularly welcoming, showing us the club lounge and then to our room by which time the bags had been put inside. What a room! A bed with the most comfortable mattress and pillows you'll ever encounter, a seating area with a large sofa and a writing desk with swivel chair,…"
October 2012,Deserves to be Number 1# in London,"Best hotel we have stayed in on our 3 day biannual visits to London. From the moment you arrive you are treated with exemplary service by all the staff you meet.  We were taken up to the executive lounge for check in and offered a choice of 4 different champagnes as we relaxed in comfy chairs whilst the paperwork was done. When we were ready we were shown to our room where our cases had been taken for us and were given a tour and explanation of or split level suite. The bedroom had a very comfy 6ft double bed with a long list of pillow types to choose from. The bathroom was spacious with a shower wet room and separate large bath with a TV. Towels were plentiful and of good quality as were the toiletries. Downstairs we had a lounge with a desk, two comfy chairs, an open fire,…"
October 2012,The epitome of British style & luxury,"We are fortunate in this life to have spent another fabulous few days at Hotel 41 in London. One of our most favorite cities on this planet & certainly one of our TOP 5 hotels we have ever stayed at- ANYWHERE!!!! Checking in is like being welcomed into someones living room ""Take a seat, can I get you some champagne""  why yes- please & a lovely flute of Veuve Clicquot was in front of me while waiting in front of their cozy fireplace. We arrived @ noon so we were a bit early to check in- wanted to get as much time in there as possible :) Alas- our room wasnt ready & were were told they would need time to bring it up to standard. The rooms are ANYTHING BUT standard here- all the ones we have stayed in were fabulous- we have stayed in a room, & Jr Suite & this time the Monarch…"
October 2012,A little piece of heaven in London,"spent three days here, half business half pleasure.  Being a single female traveler, I felt relax and well looked after there.  i Know it is expensive, but compare to Ritz, Savoy, goring for the same price, this is far more personal, relax and better service for sure.  Small things like asking if you need a spare umbrella by the reception is a nice touch. I also like the fact it is a small hotel, occupied the entire 5th floor with the executive lounge on the same floor.  once you checked in , you just don't wanna check out! Breakfast was great, but the pancakes need improving! i only use the free evening buffet once, but very impressed by the quality of the food provided.  I'm a tea total, but there is free champagne too!  so, for £300 a night, it is kind of good value for money."
October 2012,What a honeymoon!,"We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 for our honeymoon. All we can say is WOW!!! While the location, rooms and food were all fantastic, what truly impressed us with this hotel was the FANTASTIC service we got! All our requests were granted and then some! The staff are young, dynamic and unbelievably helpful! We will definitely be staying here again and highly recommend it to anyone visiting London!"
October 2012,The perfect place to start our marriage,"We were married in London over the weekend and wanted to pamper ourselves with a top class hotel for our wedding weekend. We looked at the Savoy, the Ritz, the Landmark, etc, but the reviews on TripAdvisor swayed us to try Hotel 41 instead - and we couldn't have been happier with the choice!   I stayed the night before the wedding with my maid of honour and the wedding night with the groom, and the staff were so helpful in assisting with all of the wedding morning preparation. We were upgraded to a suite, and the split level layout was perfect as my room filled with the photographer, makeup artist and attendants. The hotel is beautiful and classically decorated and provides remarkable privacy in a central location just by Victoria station (but so quiet!). The bath was incredibly…"
January 2012,Great hotel,"My husband and I just returned from 6 nights at Hotel 41.  We have stayed at many fine hotels and this experience was one of our most memorable. It  was  not just the painstaking attention to detail in every aspect of the physical property, but more importantly the welcoming and helpful  attitude of the staff.  We were made to feel more like old friends than just hotel guests."
September 2012,This place is amazing!!!!!!!!,"As an avid international traveler amongst the Sofitel's, Ritz Carlton's and Four Season's this experience was exceptional.  The service was spot-on and the staff was tremendous.  I would be heartbroken to stay at any other property in London. The staff was gracious and proactive--nigh telepathic--in anticipating our needs: from laundry (pricey; you should know that up front. But crucial, given our situation) to fresh towels, to extraordinary flexibility regarding maid service (I was sleeping in at ridiculous, unpredictable hours!) to cough drops and tea and extra blankets and a thousand other small but much-appreciated kindnesses.  This place is amazing!!!!!!!! had an amazing time there, highly recommend."
October 2012,Exceeded high expectations!,"My wife and I recently took our first trip to London. We were thoroughly impressed with our Hotel 41 experience. The great location was within walking distance of so many must-see sights. The spotless room was by far the most stylish we'd ever seen, and it was loaded with innumerable amenities (e.g., fireplace, heated towel rack, office supplies, etc). Perhaps the most notable feature was the unparalleled level of service. From the charming personnel in the lobby to the attentive servers in the Executive Lounge to the accommodating assistant manager (Monika), all went far above and beyond. There is no question in our minds that when we eventually return for our second visit to London that we will be well-cared for in the tucked-away secret at 41 Buckingham Palace Road! Highly…"
October 2012,A Special Place,"We are Londoners and wanted a special night away together - and 41 delivered all we could have hoped for.  Lovely people, special ambiance, and a sense of being made special - all the time.  We have no hesitation in recommending 41 - we enjoyed our stay there more than perhaps any other hotel."
July 2012,Pampered like The Queen,"We recently visited London, 2 days on the beginning of our trip going to Croatia and Italy. We stayed at the next door Hotel Rubens, which was quite lovely comfortable and very well located.  Because we loved Rubens, while there we tried to rebook for our return trip, they were totally booked; however a lovely lady there suggested their ""sister hotel, 41,"" which has a separate entrance and elevator to ""the fifth floor"" and a very different world. Welcomed with sparkling wine, invited for snakes which were a meal, treated to a lovely lite breakfast and night caps.  Beds turned down, heated towel racks, bottled water to your hearts desire and much more.  The staff was the most ""can do people"" ever!  They can get you tickets to anything and are so wonderful at making you feel…"
September 2012,PERFECTION!,"Not a fault. Worth every penny and more. Perfect for sight seeing without travelling far. Sooooo luxurious, rooms are beautiful and staff are very helpful. Will visit again with family or with friends."
September 2012,Location Location Location - plus great service,"If you are visiting London for romance, pleasure and site seeing, you can't go past Hotel 41. Situated right where all the action is, near Victoria Station and Buckingham Palace, I was transported to a wonder world - this was my first visit to London. My wife and I were looked after with great care. Highly recommended, the hotel won't dissappoint."
September 2012,Charming and lovely hotel,We spent only 2 days in this charming hotel as we were passing through London.  The facilities are cozy and well thought out with a lovely dining/social area.  The hotel has only 20 or so rooms.  Our room was somewhat small but the standard of the facilities and the in-room chimney made up for it!  Location is outstanding being rot next to Buckingham Palace and walking distance from Hyde Park and Oxford Street.  Highly recommend this hotel!
September 2012,expensive but very good,this place is located in very attreactive place with all amenities nearby especially near the tube station. its expensive but you pay for what you get. great staffs. rooms are clean and tidy. would come again on our next anniversary.
August 2012,"Love, love, LOVE the Hotel 41","My experience at the Hotel 41 is unsurpassed by any property I’ve visited before (and I get to travel a lot!).  Particularly, Monika was an absolute jewel and a new friend.  I was celebrating my birthday while in London and Monika arranged for all of my dinners based on her exquisite taste.  I travel alone, but on this trip I was never alone…thanks to Monika, Magda, William, the two lovely ladies who greeted me every time I returned to the hotel and the wait staff in the Executive Lounge.  I appreciated all of the little touches:  little birthday cake, the birthday rose, the turndown service with the “Sleep” spray, the canapés, the olives, the slippers, the bottled water that was handed to me as I left the hotel.  All of it made this birthday the best one in recent memory.  I…"
October 2012,Good Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night. Whilst the the quality of the service is excellent, I found it extremely odd that this hotel did not have a designated check-in/check-out area which was done at the time in the executive lounge.   We stayed at other Red Carnations Hotels, and I don't think that Hotel 41 is in any way better than the Chesterfield Hotel or the Montague on the Gardens.   A lot has been said in the reviews of Hotel 41 about the quality of the service and the excellent staff. I agree that the service is excellent and the staff helpful, however, I found the whole experience a little bit overbearing. It seemed that the staff wanted to have a long conversation every time they poured a new glass of wine. I, for one, prefer that wonderful British…"
September 2012,Best B&B in London,"From the moment we arrived at the airport, the limousine picked us up and dropped us at the door steps of the hotel.  You almost could miss the door, if not paying attention.  The doorman let us in and we were greeted with a glass of champagne.  The room, with a bathtub, shower and fireplace was plush and the king-size bed and bedding was perfectly comfortable.  The concierge helped us book reservations at great restaurants and shows.  We met some wonderful people - other guests.  The meals were delicious and the wine superb.  We will not go anywhere else in London and will definitely go back."
October 2012,if the neighborhood is good enough for the Queen...,"Fantastic location, just a couple of blocks from Victoria station and a couple of blocks from Buckingham Palace.  The service was exceptional- possibly the best service we have ever encountered. Our room was very small,  but it was well appointed.  Trip Advisor did us well.  We will return."
October 2012,Won't stay at another London Hotel,"We've stayed at several other high end hotels including the Ritz and Connaught and for us, 41 outranks them all.  Quiet, warm, and a wonderful friendly staff.  They go out of their way to give the best service possible and they quickly learn and use your name.  I'm a fairly picky person regarding hotel cleanliness and this is the only hotel I've stayed at that sanitizes their tv and radio remote controls."
September 2012,"A Good Stay, Not a Perfect One.","We recently stayed 2 nights at 41.  It is located on the 5th floor of the Rubens at the Palace hotel.  We had stayed in the Rubens several times during trips to London and decided to give 41 a go this trip.  We were greeted by the friendly staff on arrival and eventhough we arrived early in the morning we were able to get into our room after just a short wait.  While waiting we were offered a drink of our choice which was a nice touch.  The room was nice and roomy by London standards.  The overall decor is black and white, we had a small window that looked out on an office building and the construction below. We did recieve yummy treats in our room after turndown service but the pillow menu eluded us, which is not that big of a deal.  There were some concerns overall with the…"
October 2012,Wonderful honeymoon stay!,What a wonderful boutique hotel.  Staff was amazing.  Very knowledgeable and eager to please their quests.  No request was too small or too large for them to handle.  Rooms are a bit small but very comfortable and clean.  The lounge is lovely to just sit by the fire and have a drink or read a book. Look forward to staying here again.
October 2012,Another Wonderful Stay,"This was our second stay at the 41 (the first was in December 2011).  The 41 is a wonderful, comfortable, cozy place to stay.  The rooms have an air of understated elegance, with every amenity that  you would need for your stay, including umbrellas, business supplies, a pillow menu (!), access to exercise equipment, and a tasty treat in your room upon arrival.    We were welcomed with a glass of champagne by Freddie, the Resident Manager of the hotel.  He is a genuinely caring person, who remembers past guests and makes sure that every guest feels at home...he and Monika ( the assistant manager, and equally kind) make you feel that you are part of the family, as does the rest of the staff of the hotel.  We recognized many employees from our last trip and they remembered us,…"
October 2012,Fabulous Hotel and Staff,"We thoroughly enjoyed our beautiful, artistic room and the delicious breakfasts and late evening snacks in the lounge.  The hotel staff felt like a cross between family and personal attendants, and we can't say enough about the conviviality and professionalism of the staff. The location was convenient for us, but we would go out of our way to return to this marvelous hotel.  It was perfect in every way."
October 2012,Love this hotel,Staying at 41 always makes me think that this is what it must be like living in that big house just around the corner.  Service is amazing - friendly without being creepy - and you always meet the most interesting people in the executive lounge.  I've stayed there 3 times in the past year and can't wait until I can stay there again.
October 2012,"Lovely central hotel, amazing service","We just stayed 4 nights in the executive king room....which was lovely. I would not get a smaller room .... this was good for the 4 nights we had. The hotel is charming, but made even more so by the staff.  I would describe this as a boutique hotel with personalised service. Staff know your name, and are only very happy to assist. Breakfast both cooked and continental is amazing, best I have ever had....a perfect way to start the day.  The continental offered great options and excellent muesli...which may not seem exciting but it is often hard to find....strawberries, blueberries, all fresh.  There is the executive lounge which is an added bonus...you can call by for cheese or sweets, there is also a full bar, which operates by honesty box. There is a fireplace to sit next to to…"
September 2012,Superb all the way,"Me and my better half stayed at the Hotel 41 for 3nights. And it was superb from beginning till the end. The staff was fantastic from the day we booked the hotel and they contacted us in the days before arrival to be sure that everything was in order. They had superb controll of everything. The transfer from and to Heathrow was as we asked for, we could ask for whatever we wanted and they could fix it ( and they was very quick to fix it), the rooms was exellent and had everything, and the area the hotel are placed is very good with only a short nice walk away from Buckingham and the shopping areas. All in all we have found the hotel we will stay in every time we are visiting London."
October 2012,Excellent service ...,"I stayed at Hotel 41 for 2 nights during my visit to London in September. It was my first stay and reason was its location. I was very pleased with the service, all personnel was very helpful and always with smiling face ..."
October 2012,Wonderful hotel!,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for 6 nights in October to celebrate our 40th anniversary. We were extremely pleased with every aspect of our stay. The hotel is in a great location- near the subway, across the street from The Mews and down the street from Buckingham Palace and St James Park.  Our room and the hotel's dining/ sitting room in  The Library was most pleasant. It was the extraordinary  service, however, that sets this small  hotel apart. The staff is extremely  attentive, helpful, eager to help with suggestions for things to do,  dinner and theater reservations, and available 24/7. We would return in a heartbeat and recommend Hotel 41 without reservation."
October 2012,Excellent service but building works nearby,"The service at this hotel is excllent along with the location, food quality, cleanliness etc.  Unfortunately there is a building site just behind the property and work is approved until 11.30 pm at night and starts at 5.30 am. This is out of the control of the hotel and the staff were very apologetic however I would have preferred to be prewarned or given a room at the front of the hotel. I desperately needed sleep on my first evening so the jackhammer noise made it a nightmare. Check also that you get the room you ordered, I was expecting a room with a fireplace which didn't materialise.  The staff are wonderful and I recieved an email from the manager apologising for the noise."
October 2012,Amazing Quality & Service,"I booked this hotel based on the reviews here, and as a surprise for my wife for our 20th wedding anniversary. What can I say other than the hotel and every member of staff were fantastic. Having stayed at many other five star hotels, this was a real eye opener as to what quality and service is all about. The hotel provided a complimentary bottle of Champagne on arrival, and also a romantic turn-down service (Rose petals, candles and a congratulations cake with another bottle of Champagne) when we returned from our meal in London. I booked the hotel only four days before arrival and was lucky to get a room considering it was a Saturday night, I also wanted to get tickets for a West End show, being a typical man and leaving this right til the last minute all tickets were sold out…"
September 2012,Magnificent Hotel 41 - a real gem in London!,"We have just had three nights at Hotel 41 in an Executive King Room, to celebrate my 60th and our 35th Wedding Anniversary and to see our daughter who lives in London. From the moment we walked into the hotel we knew our stay was going to be special. We loved the black and white decor and the ambience in the Executive Lounge - very calming.  Our daughter was meeting us at 41 after we arrived from Paris - Monika made her feel welcome to await our arrival.  What a wonderful way to celebrate - champagne on arrival and such a warm and inviting atmosphere.  The staff allowed us to catch up with our daughter whilst enjoying the champagne and just sit and enjoy the lounge area - fire going - wonderful!  Special thanks to all the staff at 41 - everyone is so attentive and friendly and…"
September 2012,a truly individual 5* hotel - highly recommend,"I booked a basic room for one night during London Design Week for my daughter and myself. If this was basic goodness knows what the superior rooms were like. From the minute we made the reservation to the time that we left the staff could not do enough to make our stay comfortable and memorable. Our room was on 2 levels with a couch, flat screen tv, small table with 2 chairs, and a living flame gas fire downstairs; upstairs was a superking bed, another flat screen tv, ipod dock, bathroom. All the window blinds were electronically controlled. I believe that there are just under 40 bedrooms in the hotel and it is situated on the top floor of its sister hotel, The Ruebens, in what used to be the ballroom. The reception area is like a country house library, with reading nooks, a…"
September 2012,I wish I was still there...,"My husband and I stayed at 41 during our first trip to London. We booked the hotel, based on the reviews read on this website, so I thought it was only fair that I was just as helpful to any other potential guests.   We are the parents of 3 children, and we decided to take a “second honeymoon”.  We booked a basic room with breakfast included...but we got SO much more!! Our flight got into London at 7am and we arrived at the hotel around 8 am, only expecting to be able to store our bags..but the saints that they are, had our room ready for us. We were able to freshen up, and they were even able to get us last minute tickets to the Tower of London. The people working there gave us excellent recommendations on how to spend our day. We entered our room, and a bottle of champagne on…"
October 2012,Pampered excellence,"Treated like royals (unlike the taxi driver who suggested we wouldn't be staying there as it was too expensive for us). Extremely helpful staff, fantastic room, really flexible with check in /out and luggage storage, all the nice little touches, great lounge area for true relaxation. The full package!! Definitely stay again."
March 2012,unbelievable,"This hotel is just perfect. I can't believe all the attention I have received during this stay. My business tripwas more a leisure treat at the end. Car transfer organised last minutes, fax and e-mail dealt by the team, last minute meeting in their boardroom for free. My colleagues all enjoyed the lounge and the boardroom for lunch. It has been such a great experience. I'm looking forward to return.  The icing on the cake was the young manager in charge of this hotel (Frederic, don't be shy to call him Freddie). He was second to none and I watched him going from one table to an other, chatting with guests, paying a lot of attention to them that I couldbn't believe where he could take his energy from.   I stayed 5 days and I have seen him everyday. Morning, Afternoon, dinner and…"
July 2012,I recommend this hotel to everyone,"I have stayed at 41 only twice and each time the service, friendliness and the atmosphere were terrific.  I particularly liked after flying in from the States, they allowed me into my room so early in the day.  You will enjoy your stay here even though the taxi driver may quiz you a bit more as to where you're going.  "
July 2012,A really wonderful experience,"We loved our stay at Hotel 41. Although we were exhausted after our long flight from Australia, we could not resist when they said that it was their tradition to serve Champagne on arrival in their lounge. Even my husband who stays regularly at beautiful hotels loved the intimacy and club-like feel. Breakfast was lovely with a la carte hot food rather than hours old buffet. We loved the plunder the pantry idea, but unfortunately were too busy in London to sit around relaxing in the serene lounge fully enjoying it. The staff were young and fantastic and it was an excellent location."
May 2012,"Excellent service, charming room, great food.","Can't wait to visit here again.. this is my new favorite hotel in London. It's definitely boutique so if you are looking for a big hotel this isn't the place.... but the service is perfect and I love raiding the pantry... the bread basket, cheeses, meats, ice cream...you don't need to go out to dinner!  Location can't be beat either, especially for walking through the parks, Sloane Square, Belgravia and West End."
July 2012,"high expectations, effortlessly surpassed","My wife and I kicked off our honeymoon at Hotel 41 in May this year, and we were looking for something a little bit special given the circumstances.  Having looked at the website, my expectations were set pretty high, and from the second we entered Hotel 41 they were surpassed, and by some way too.   I stay in hotels regularly on business, and have enjoyed some of the UK's well-renowned hotels, but Hotel 41 is in an entirely different league. From the exquisite attention to detail, to the unrivalled levels of personal service, to the quiet, cocooned atmosphere the whole place exudes, this is by far the best hotel I've ever experienced and we will definitely be back. The staff, from the manager, to the chef, to the front of house team could not do enough to make us feel like we…"
July 2012,The difference in the details,"We just stayed two nights with 41. Wonderful experience. We stayed in an executive hospitality suite which had a bed set up for my son in a small room with dining table and a separate bath.  Our room was long and had a dining table, sitting area, two televisions and a nice bathroom.  The staff was phenomenal and called us by name. (thanks Monika and Stefan!). The ""executive lounge"" is a lovely place for breakfast, tea or cocktails.  Location was great- across from Buckingham Palace and lots to eat and drink in the area.  Highly recommend!"
May 2012,Very Cozy,I have visited this hotel many times over the past 11 years. I do not the fact the hotel only has a small amount of guest rooms and the ambiance of the library/lounge. The service is good and local knowledge in this property is okay.Guest rooms are a little small. The overall package however is one that is very good you will feel more like a house guest than a hotel guest. Privacy is quite good as it is tucked away from all the noisy  tourists. I would definitely suggest this property for those going to London on business or pleasure.
July 2012,THE BEST - MUST GO,I had a wonderful trip to London - I am a bit of a Hotel snob as I travel for buisness and what I liked most was i didnt feel as if I were in a Hotel - Very warm and cozy feeling.  Service was excellent.  The plunder the pantry was a bit fancy for my taste - Some American Junk food would be nice - for those of us that do not have such a gourmet palate.  They arranged for a car to pick us up and that was nice - and saved time.  Loved the bed (I have a bad back).  Zillions of amenities in the room.  It was fun just searching the room and finding little things everywhere. I kept the hotel room key - and have a laugh and smile everytime I see it in my wallet - I think I will keep it forever as a reminder of an excellent trip....be prepared to spend some $$$$ but worth it
July 2012,wow wow wow,"What a wonderful place this is. My partner and I attended the Madonna concert and as a surprise I booked this amazing hotel for the night...and wish it was for the week. From the moment we arrived we were attended to with a wonderful, warm and friendly greeting. All the staff are so professional yet approachable and kind. A special mention to Fredrique..a man who clearly knows how to make you feel at ease and special. Thank you Fredrique. The Hotel..Stunning..wonderful decor, attention to detail (as were the staff) The room..the phone has a 'whenever, whatever' button with those exact words on it..I kid you not..and they mean exactly that.  The bed was so comfortable..the bathroom was gorgeous with a great selection of creams and potions. 5 mins into our stay we had a knock on…"
July 2012,Best Hotel in the UK,"This is the first time I've written a review on tripadvisor but wanted to share our experience because we were so impressed. Me and my boyfriend have just come back from a short trip to London where we stopped at Hotel 41 and have never been so sad to leave a hotel. From the moment we arrived we were treat like royalty. The staff go above and beyond to make your stay exceptional and the hotel itself is amazing. Stay here, you will not be disappointed!!!"
July 2012,Truly a special place!,"Every business is about people and the staff at the Hotel 41 is simply amazing.  I cannot remember staying at a hotel anywhere in the world where every single member of the staff from top to bottom was as kind, helpful, polite, and accommodating as the Hotel 41. We came as travelers and we left as friends. The physical property itself is quite comfortable with a common 2 floor room used for meals, relaxing, tea, etc.  Our room was well appointed and updated and the linens were pleasant and comfortable. There is a breakfast buffet out every morning that is quite nice as well as snacks, afternoon tea, and late night food just for the taking. the location worked well for us as we were vacationing and wanted to see the typical tourist destinations. Buckingham Palace is across the…"
May 2012,An Undiscovered Jewel!,"I usually stay at Lanesborough or Dorchester....but because it was SUmmer and close to the Olympics, they were sold out.......I was directed to 41 Hotel as a 5 Star replacement, and I was NOT DISAPPOINTED !!!  This is a sister property to the more well known Reubens Hotel, anmd they share a Bar and Restaurant.....what you get at 41 HOTEL IS ACCESS TO A PRIVATE MANSION, WITH YOUR OWN PRIVATE SUITE !!!  the Executive Lounge is your own private hideaway in London, akin to having your own private apartment.....but without the necessary formality of the other 5 Stars.......if you want to be treated like you are at home in your private Mansion in London, this is for you!!!!! Why buy when you can stay at 41 for a week or two and be pampered like you are the Lord Of The…"
May 2012,Exceptional stay at Hotel 41,"As a frequent traveller on business, I do not dedicate much time to writing hotel reviews. Hotel 41; however, is much more than a hotel. It was an experience. The attention to detail and exceptional staff made me feel more welcome than any other european hotel ever has. This willingness to go the extra mile is what motivated my desire to thank the owners for truly being attentive to their guests and encourage those who haven't yet been guests to visit this rare pearl. I believe that one can understand how wonderful a hotel is when instead of looking forward to returning home, it pinches one's heart to leave."
July 2012,Fantastic,This is someplace i tell you. I felt like a king when i stayed here its amazing. The rooms and the hotel is finished to a very high standard.  This is a dream hotel a little exspensive but well worth it for a treat. I will be returning at somepoint.
July 2012,Royal treatment,If you want to be pampered like royalty search no longer... This is the perfect dream hotel. Everything you can imagine and much more. The best service we`ve already experienced in our lifetime.
August 2011,"Fantastic hotel, the best service!","This hotel is a great find - the staff are so incredibly helpful, very attentive, polite and go the extra mile to make your stay extremely memorable. Normally we would stay at other 5 star hotels in London and would receive great service, but this is just on a different level. Very quiet, savoir beds with mattress toppers, superfine cotton bedlinen, unbelievable  breakfast (with pink champagne if required - which is also provided on arrival) and lovely executive lounge with honesty bar for late night drinks - but hotel very quiet and peaceful. Will return for sure - now my hotel of choice in London for business or pleasure."
July 2012,41 Gets it Right,"My wife and I stayed at 41 for our honeymoon, and loved everything about our stay.  The service is exceptional.  All the little touches are done well.    Without being obtrusive, the staff is vigilant and gets all the details right.  Every time we left the room it was straightened before our return.  Water at night, fruit left in your room as a snack, it is like the staff knows what you want before you want it.  The rooms are great, although we had to examine a few before settling on one with one that had high enough ceilings to accommodate my height.  The concierge was amazing and got us fantastic tickets (second row, center) to a sold out performance of Wicked on little notice.  If you have the means and will be in London, then stay at 41.  My wife and I look forward to…"
June 2012,"The real jewel in the crown in London is ""41""","For the third year in a row, my husband and I stayed at 41, aptly named for its location at 41 Buckingham Palace Road. Yes, it is right across the street from the Queen's residence and a short walk to The Green Park, St. James Park, all the sights, and great restaurants. You can walk anywhere from 41!  41 is part of the fabulous Red Carnation hotels, and 41 lives up to its 5 star rating. The staff know your name the moment you arrive (and from year to year), the accomodations are spectacular, the attention to detail is beyond any we've experienced anywhere in the world. You make friends with the staff, and no request is too big or too small. I can't imagine staying anywhere else in London. The combination of location, staff, and accommodations can't be beat. I am only worried in…"
July 2012,Wonderful,I had planned a special weekend for my best friends 50th birthday. Staying at hotel 41 was part of this and it was wonderful. Pink champagne on arrival and such a lovely reception from the staff. They were engaging and interested. The room was small but quality and we loved the 'whatever whenever' button on the phone. On returning to our room we found a birthday cake and two red roses on our beds boy did we feel special. What made us feel like princesses was the way we were treated with such interest and care. We adored the executive lounge with service on tap and the pantry to raid at will. Nothing was too much trouble and having requested a taxi for a certain time the receptionist even ran around the corner and up the road to find one and bring it back to the hotel for us.…
June 2012,Great location with amazing staff and elegance.,This is a great high end boutique hotel. The staff is awesome and make you feel welcome and important. Upon arrival we had a glass of champaign waiting and snacks to refresh us.  The room was huge (by london standards) and had air conditioning which was a bonus. The location was very convenient to just about everything. We were definitely pleased we picked this hotel over a chain or others. 
May 2012,Everything is 5 star,"We stayed a single night inour return to Australia after spending 6 weeks travelling Europe. We had decided to splurge for our last night are we were not disappointed. Everything from the greeting at reception, the complimentary champagne, the comfortable bedand room, the lounge where we were able to relax after a days shopping and enjoy complimentary cheese, nibbles and ice creams. All excellent. Great people and a great location!"
June 2012,What an amazing hotel,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for 3 nights in late June/early July this year.  We loved everything about it - our room, the hotel location, and most of all the wonderful staff.  We travel quite a bit, for both business and personal trips, and this was one of our top hotel experiences ever.  From the time we checked in through the time we had to leave to go home, all of the staff was so friendly, helpful and professional.  They always went above and beyond. We will definitely go back."
August 2012,Simply amazing!,"Great service, great location, great staff! Champagne on arrival and a complimentary buffet in the welcoming lounge. All the Staff are helpful, polite and friendly. The atmosphere is relaxed yet luxurious and the breakfasts are to die for. Cannot recommend highly enough. "
December 2011,"Quirky Rooms, Awesome Service","My husband and I spent Christmas in London, and given the number of places closed during that week (the wisdom of our trip timing was debatable), we spent a lot of time at the Hotel 41. The staff could not have been kinder or more accommodating. We loved our Deco-inspired room, and its small size didn't bother us because we had access to the cozy common area with all of its lovely teas, cocktails and snacks. One caveat -- we would not recommend the adjacent restaurant (within a sister property next door to the 41), where we had Christmas Eve and Christmas meals. To be fair ... perhaps the food is fine at other times (non-holidays)."
July 2012,Our wonderful stay at Hotel 41,"From the moment we arrived at Hotel 41, we were treated like Royalty. From the friendly professional staff to the elegant but comfortable surroundings - nothing was too much trouble. Hotel 41 made our London break an unforgettable experience and we can't wait to return."
August 2012,A Gem In The City of London Not to be Missed,"We had the privilege to stay at Hotel 41 during the Olympic Games.  This is a very unusual time for a property and often hard to meet normal standards as delivery, traffic patterns and security often add challenges.  This was our 11th Olympics and the Hotel, and Staff far exceeded our expectations.  Last Games we were at The Four Seasons and these guys far exceeded that experience.  We will absolutely be back and hope to do business at the hotel too!  Service by Frederic and his team was Gold Medal all the way."
August 2012,Good and cozy hotel,"I stood for one night in Hotel 41. The overall expression - 41 is great and luxury hotel. Perfect service. But two things was not so perfect - the room was not ready and I waited for about an hour (to be honest, it was very comfortable waiting); the temperature knob in the shower was broken and I spend about 10 funny minutes trying to get comfortable water temperature. And the usual thing in almost all hotels - the bed was short for me (I'm 194cm tall)."
June 2012,My Second Splendid Visit In As Many Months,"After having stayed here two months previous, in April, '41' had left a fantastic impression on me, so when I had to come back to London, choosing a hotel was a no brainer. You see, 41 did not only  provide the sheer luxury one would expect from a property of this stature, but moreover, the service provided at this boutique hotel was truly second to none. Indeed, in all their proprieties, it seems that Red Carnation has signaled the one most important factor in creating the finest hotels in the world, and it is the people who work there, for you can have grand lobbies and fabulously appointed rooms, but without spectacular, personal, and even somewhat intimate service, everything amounts to nothing. Yes, 41 is wonderfully appointed. The Executive Lounge is just the right size,…"
August 2012,Rivals the Ritz and Four Seasons here in the states...,"The attention to detail by the staff is second to none.  Frederic, the hotel manager is unbelievable he is there to deliver at your every request.  The hotel only has 28-30rooms and this is great b/c it allows the staff to cater to your every need.   The cleanliness of the hotel is amazing!  Slippers, robes, flowers, classical music, your beverage of choice bedside every evening for you. The executive lounge is a great place to relax, eat great food or enjoy the nightly snacks beverages all included in your stay. Location was great right across street from buckingham palace and the tube station just around the corner 2min walk tops."
July 2012,London for the Olympics and a stay at the Hotel 41,"In July of 2012 we made our reservations for the 2012 Olympic tickets that included a stay in a hotel unknown to us – Hotel 41. Looking at the website and especially the Youtube video on their landing page told us we were in for a treat, but nothing we read or saw could prepare us for the wonderful stay we enjoyed. The hotel is located in the shadow of Buckingham Palace, just across the street from the Royal Stables. Hyde Park is a few minutes away on foot as is Green Park and St. jame’s Park, and of course the changing of the guard at the Palace is even closer.  The hotel is tucked in between the Rubens Hotel and a great little bar – the Bbar. All three are part of the Ruebens family and charges can be made at all three and posted to you 41 account. The arrival lobby is small…"
July 2012,STAY AWAY...because I want to make sure I can always stay here,"I've stayed at Hotel 41 several times over the years and never left without feeling relaxed and with a smile. It is pricey but well worth it in my mind. The staff and the ""quaint"" feeling of the hotel make it perfect for travel. Not for the wallet conscious, but ideal for those special times."
September 2012,Buckingham Palace Garden Party,"What a wonderful location for the palace!  After being invited along to one of this year's garden parties and after having this hotel recommended to us by friends who had stayed here previously, we booked a double room.  On arrival we checked in with a complimentary G & T and were told that our room was not available for us to change before rushing out to the palace, so we were upgraded to the Monarch suite! Our room was absolutely wonderful, clean crisp sheets, a wonderful night's sleep in a very comfy bed.  The following morning the breakfast was perfect, lots of choices. The staff were very helpful, friendly and very professional. We would definitely recommend this hotel to all!"
October 2011,Like being at home...,"We stayed for three delightful nights and am already looking forward to going back. The ambiance, the staff, the rooms - all superb/top of class. We were originally planning on staying in the Corinthia (which is also a delightful hotel in a great location), but I'm really glad we stayed at the 41. Due to its offering (particularly the size and ""homely"" feel) it is a really unique proposition in London. I really haven't come across anything similar before and will now not be looking to stay anywhere else when in town."
August 2012,"London ""Royal"" Hotel","WOW!!  I truly feel - we know how ""royalty"" is treated in London....for from the minute we walked into this lovely hotel- we all were treated as if we were the only people in the hotel.  The hotel is just beautiful, the rooms and suites are very well done and extremely comfortable - but it is the thoughtful, creative and personable things they do for each guest that makes it such an AMAZING hotel.  It is defintely a hidden gem - and selfishly I hope it will always be that way!! We defintely are planning a return trip to Hotel 41 - soon!!  Enjoy!!!"
September 2012,A Truly Extraordinary Experience,"It is so difficult to express how extraordinary our experience was with Hotel 41 without it sounding hyperbolic, but it is, quite simply, the most incredible hotel at which we have ever had the pleasure to stay.  It is not just a coincidence that the hotel is located just down the street from Buckingham Palace, as you are truly treated as royalty when you are there.  The room  was beyond beautiful, ultra plush and comfortable, pristinely clean and roomy.  The food and drink in the Executive Lounge were five star, but it is the service that makes this property 'sui generis', truly in a category by itself.    Frederic, the manager, has a 'team' working for him that could not have been more attentive, friendly or efficient. Our every single need and desire was met by the staff,…"
September 2012,"I want it to remain our secret, but it's just too good to keep quiet!","Based on the Trip Advisor scores, which made it the favourite London hotel of reviewers, we recently spent two wonderful nights in this oasis of calm and sophistication ideally positioned at the rear of Buckingham Palace. I don't want to spoil it for future clients by disclosing some of the thoughtful and unique touches that ""41"" do for their guests, but suffice to say, you will love them all. 41 is a relatively small and intimate hotel, and you are ""buzzed in"" as you would be when seeking to enter a high end jewellers and you are met everytime, by a genuinely friendly member of the reception staff who often knows you by name, and enquires how your day has been. The actual reception and check in desk , and all of the rooms are located on the top floor of the building which is…"
August 2012,Wonderful!,My husband and I stayed for one night to celebrate my birthday. Simply the best hotel we have stayed in managing to combine thoughtful luxury and cosiness. Wish we could have stayed longer and hope to return at some stage. Would thoroughly recommend for a special treat as not cheap.
September 2012,I want to live here!!!!,"I don't think I could ever do 41 justice in words.  From the moment we walked thru the door, we felt that we were the only ones that mattered in the hotel.  The staff  was incredible.  The rooms decorated beautifully.  The special touches that the hotel provided were a welcome surprise.  My husband and I have traveled a great deal, all over the world, and I still can say that 41 is my   favorite hotel.  We will be planning our next vacation in an area where we are able to stay at a Red Carnation hotel.    I wish our stay in London was at the end of our trip.  The experience spoiled us for the est of our trip."
September 2012,Bed and breakfast like charm,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for our anniversary. It was such a wonderful experience with the most personal service. The staff was so personable and friendly. Our room was near the Executive Lounge which gave us the feeling of a bed and breakfast.    Each night we went into the lounge and grabbed some complementary treats for a midnight snack.  Every evening the hotel stocks free ice cream, chips, chocolates, meats and cheeses for their guests. We were always welcomed with friendly faces and personal greetings, and the staff was more than happy to accomodate every request.  We have stayed at many fine hotels but we feel this was our favorite one because it was not only beautiful but catered exceptionally to any and all of our needs."
March 2012,5 Star Quality with a personnel touch,Quality hotel for a special occasion or simply to treat your self while on business. The experience starts with a glass of champagne on arrival in the executive lounge. Staff are very attentive and friendly. Surroundings and atmosphere are stylish. Breakfast in the executive lounge is not to be missed. Rooms are styled on a black and white theme and are very well appointed. Would recommend for the discerning traveller. 
August 2012,Best Anniversary Experience!,"My husband and I stayed for two nights in March 2012. Best choice ever to celebrate our 25th anniversary! Only wished we could have stayed longer. Awesome from the moment you step in, you know you have walked into a magical place. Impecabble on every aspect. Complimentary champagne on arrival and the rest does not disappoint. The staff is what really makes this place special, they all deserve a pay raise!  Location is excellent, breakfast is delicious. You almost hate to leave in the morning, you feel so comfortable in your hotel. Do not miss the tea service under any circumstance! We are still talking about it months later!  Five stars all the way!!!  Thank you Hotel 41!"
June 2012,First Class,"We recently had the pleasure of a 3 night stay at Hotel 41 to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary and it was just perfect.  From the minute we arrived until we sadly departed we were made to feel special and nothing was too much trouble.  All of the staff we encountered were cheerful, friendly, and attentive, without being over bearing.    On the night of our anniversary we returned to a rosepetal covered room complete with candles and bubbles, a really lovely touch and very much appreciated!  We had also received a lovely little anniversary cake with our breakfast that morning which sadly I never got around to eating as was so full from the amazing cooked breakfast!!  If you want to stay in a big busy hotel in London there are probably thousands to choose from, if you want 5…"
June 2012,Outstanding!,"We spent six days at 41 during our recent trip to London and quite simply it was a trip highlight. The rooms are not huge but they are incredibly well furnished with all the amenities. Its very luxurious. But the real treat is the staff. They are all wonderful. With all 28 rooms on one floor and with an Executive Lounge on the same floor, you have a perfect place to relax whenever there is a respite in your day and, of course, while doing so you interact with the staff. We were traveling with our two college age kids and all four of us loved the staff interaction and enjoyed the superb, but not pretentious service. There is always something to eat of drink there as well and the breakfast is fabulous. We have traveled extensively and its as good a hotel experience as we have ever…"
June 2012,"Very nice, but 'the best'???","Rented 2 rooms for 3-4 days.  The rooms are excellent, and immaculately appointed.  The personal service provided is excellent.  The food in the restaurant is superb...all at an impressive price.  Breakfast for 2 for ~$100?   Seems pretty steep.  Several 'hiccups' during our stay.  I requested flowers and chocolates in our daughters room (to celebrate their 2nd anniversary), and they were in our room.  My daughter asked about a visit to Buckingham Palace, and she was told that it was closed on the day she requested.  (6/30).  However, when walking past the Palace, we stopped by the office, and made her and her husband reservations for the visit, which went great (thanks to her perseverance, and not listening to our concierge).  Power from the floor plugs were 'off'' for several…"
June 2012,Live like the Royals!,"Choose this hotel immediately - it's the best hotel I've ever been to. Stayed with my mom for 5 nights to explore London for the first time (I'm 22). To be honest, this hotel was my favorite part of my visit!! First of all, the service is way beyond first class! Needed a new room change, printing items, searching for restaurants, recommendations on the city...and much more. I think all of our questions and need for assistance was perhaps a little too much, but the staff was always able to provide the best information with a smile. To add to my travel experience, I ended up losing my passport! The hotel staff asked for all possible places I may have lost it and called/searched for us 24/7. Every time I saw them, they were calling again and again. They told me, ""Enjoy your trip in…"
April 2012,Nice Hotel,I stayed in Hotel 41 for 5 days during my business trip to London.   Some taxis have difficulty in identifying the hotel since its part of the Rubens hotel (a kind of). But I must say Hotel 41 got a very friendly and professional team which makes a big difference compared to other hotels I stayed. Also the lounge is beautiful though small and a connected restaurant with a library. Also the rooms have a very good ambiance with a nice black & white theme. Breakfast was nice but be prepared to wait for 15 minutes at least if you order some cooked food.
August 2011,An Experience,"We wanted to have a couple of days in London as a first leg of our honeymoon before we flew out to Mexico. We booked hotel 41 purely based on the amazing reviews on trip adviser. We recieved the form to fill in prior to arrival with our drink preferences etc. We had also requested a bottle of champagne to be in our room on ice on our arrival.  We booked a king room for 2 nights. The hotel is quite difficult to find, particurlarly if you are not used to driving in central london, because I had read so many reviews in advance I was aware of what to look out for wich helped. We used the vallet service which worked well and the cost of parking was simply added to our bill.  On arival we were greeted with a complimentary glass of champagne and checked in. Staff were friendly and…"
June 2012,traditional,"Great place to stay, very traditional and more than close to the queen!! a lovely place to stay and a brilliant set of staff to go with it, great stay"
June 2012,Great Hotel,"Staff is amazing and love the free ice cream in the pantry. Stayed five nights on vacation and had a wonderful time. They let us sneak up on the roof to watch the fly over portion of the Trouping the Colour and took the time to bring up champagne and snacks for everyone on the roof, a nice little extra to our visit. I would recommend Hotel 41 to anyone spending time in London."
June 2012,Great Service,"We spent a couple days here before our anniversary in London. It was a great stay, and the service was incredible. We highly reccommend this hotel for it's charm and service. The location was also great, and allowed us to walk to any location in London."
June 2012,Best hotel ever!,"Our three day stay at Hotel 41 was by far the most special experience we have ever encountered in our many years of travel.  The unique boutique hotel atmosphere was enhanced by the superb staff of professionals.  It is hard to express how special we were made to feel and we were actually sad when we had to leave our new friends when we moved on to the next stage of our travels.    When I arrived for my business trip, upon checking in they learned that my wife would be joining me the next day - I was immediately upgraded to a larger room.  While I was at my meeting, the Hotel 41 team made every effort to greet my wife and ensure that she was comfortable after her long, transcontinental flight.  Throughout our stay, they would effortlessly and unobtrusively engage us in…"
June 2012,Loved this hotel!,"We stayed here on the first night of our honeymoon before catching a flight. We read the reviews but were completely knocked off our feet when we actually got here. The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful and couldnt do enough for us. When we arrived we were greeted with welcome drinks and in our room were little cakes/biscuits. They also delivered ice, lemon and olives to our room in the evening. They also hold canapes in the Executive lounge of an evening and have a selection of food available for you to help yourself to. The room itself was extrememly clean with a huge bed, 2 showers and free internet access via the TV. We could not recommend this hotel enough, our only regret is that we could only stay the 1 night! If you are considering booking this hotel - do it,…"
August 2012,"Loved, Loved,Loved it!!!","Stayed at the beautiful Hotel 41 for two nights. Arrived from Boston into Heathrow at about 6:30 AM. Decided to run over to the hotel to drop our bags, never expecting a room to be ready at that time. They not only had our room ready for a 7:30 AM check in but everyone was so nice, friendly and helpful and the room was quiet and lovely. The location of the hotel is within walking distance to many tourist attractions and very close to two tube stations.  I can not wait to get back to beautiful London and Hotel 41!"
September 2012,Amazing!,"Oh my God, this place is the best hotel I've ever stayed at! The rooms are spacious, spotless and nicely decorated! All the staff was just amazing, everyone was friendly and helpful. I will definitely stay there again, thank you 41!"
September 2012,"Great hotel, excellent staff","Staying there now as I write this review from the Executive Lounge - relaxing and having a drink. This hotel is excellent - surpassed only by the staff who are personable, friendly, and very helpful (what more can you ask...).  Hands-down, my favorite hotel in London. "
September 2012,"Yes, this hotel deserves its #1 spot on best hotels in London","It exceeded my expectations, and that is after having read the glowing reviews on Tripadvisor.  Truly wonderful service and you feel pampered. We stayed for 3 nights in September and did the Best of British package. the tea master class was such a fun experience.  They just have all the right touches to make you feel pampered. Worth the price. Central location was great - we walked to most of the sights and places we visited. I could go on and on but I don't want to be redundant from past reviews. You won't be disappointed."
August 2012,FANTASTIC!!!   Nicest Hotel we've ever stayed in!,"It was our first trip to London and I used Tripadvisor for the planning.  Hotel 41 is everything everyone said and MORE!  From the minute we arrived to the minute we left they made us feel special.  We were directly across from the Royal Mews and they made us feel like royalty!  Our room was gorgeous and spotless!  The bed was incredibly comfortable and the pillow menu was so impressive!  Our bathroom was fantastic - 2 Showers!!  We were greeted with a large bowl of strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and raspberries shortly after arrival!  I mentioned that I was gluten free and they actually made 2 separate trays for our tea!  They provided gluten free toast at breakfast - we had egg white omelets every morning which were delicious!  They had a well stocked fridge with…"
July 2012,Unadulterated luxury and the best staff in the world,I could go on all day and night but this is quite simply one of the best hotels you will ever visit in your life. World class service and the most charming staff I have ever met. An amazing experience.
August 2012,excellent staff let down by a very average hotel!!,"This hotel is so over-rated!!  My lady friend and I stayed here for two nights in when we went to go see Madonna at Hyde Park in July of this year.  Briefly, because I do not really like to write bad reviews, I will list the faults of the hotel: breakfast is minimal (a member of staff tried to make me pay extra for porridge!!); you cannot watch the television in your bedroom from your bed; the toilet flushing system in our room broke; the sink plug did not work; the ipod docking station was not user-friendly; the bedroom was barely 4* standard.  This hotel relies heavily on the excellent service provided by the dedicated executive lounge team!!  I repeat, the quality of service is absolutely first class; whereas the hotel itself is 4* at best!!"
September 2012,Beyond Expectations,"LOVE Hotel 41!!  My husband and I cannot say enough positive things about this hotel. We stayed there for 5 nights at the end of August and were so impressed with the amazing service, executive lounge, and great location.  For the price, the inclusion of the executive lounge is a huge bonus; they always have a little something to snack on, complimentary water, and a self-serve, honor system bar.  Just steps from Buckingham Palace and a couple miles from Victoria Station, you can cut through the park and walk over to the shops at Bond Street and other sites of interest.  The staff were amazing! So friendly, always there to help with directions, recommendations, and any little need you may have. For example, I needed a quick manicure before my dinner and I told them I wanted to…"
May 2012,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed just one night at 41 for a wedding anniversary and are now saving for a return visit. We could not fault the hotel, we shared afternoon tea with our daughter and son in law and whilst we were enjoying the tea, easily comparable to The Ritz, the staff were busy turning our already luxurious room into a romantic haven! Our daughter requested the package on the day and at no notice at all the staff added rose petals, flowers, candles, champagne etc, including a personally decorated chocolate confection! It looked magical on our return but the nicest thing was that all the staff knew of our surprise and shared in our enjoyment.Customer service and attention to detail was the best we have ever encountered and because the hotel is small it had such a lovely homely feel.…"
August 2012,Still the best hotel in London,"This hotel simply is our dream hotel in London, we only stay in Boutique hotels and this is arguably one of the best in the world. The rooms are stunning the service impecable. I cant wait to stay again which will be by the end of the year.  We had a problem with our restaurant booking at the Ivy and the hotel arranged a table in the Library restaurant next door, which was lovely everything I could ask for."
July 2012,Royal Treatment,"The staff at 41 is the best. They cater to you in the impressive ""executive lounge"" as though you are a VIP. It is a guilty pleasure that spoils you forever. The attentiveness makes The Ritz look like Motel 6. The location across from the Royal Mews of Buckingham Palace places you within a few minute walk from the Underground at Victoria Station as well as Hyde Park. The room had an understated elegance and I loved how quiet it was. This is the only hotel that I have felt compelled to review... it's that good."
July 2012,Fantastic,"Not much to say, this hotel was the very best and we loved every minute of our stay! The service, the room, the staff were all amazing, we will be back and we would highly recommend it to anyone else! Please message me if you have any questions."
May 2012,Birthday celebration 2012,"Fantastic services at this hotel, if you want five stars stay here as it’s the best.  We celebrated a 40th Birthday and were treated so well.  Our daughter was made to feel like a princess throughout our stay. Our room service evening meal was amazing.  The staff went to great efforts with candelabra on the table and red rose petals all over, really lovely touch.  We also had a lovely birthday cake and even a gift, very thoughtful.  This hotel is a great location with impeccable service.  We will stay again as often as we can.  Thank you to all."
April 2012,"Well done, 41!","My partner and I enjoy staying in luxury hotels when we travel. To us, the hotel is half the fun of our vacation. So I did A LOT of research before our trip to London. As usual, I looked at all of the large luxury hotels in the area like the Dorchester, the Four Seasons and Claridge’s which were all enticing but then I started reading all of the reviews on Trip Advisor, raving about the 41. I was skeptical about it living up to all the hype but boy did it!   We stayed five nights at the 41 hotel in May, 2012. We loved every minute of it from the time we checked in to the time we checked out and here’s why… Everyone at the 41 seems to truly enjoy their jobs and I mean everyone! The moment we walked into the small lobby we were greeted happily by the receptionist and led upstairs…"
June 2012,Well good!,"My wife and I returned here and this time we stayed in a Junior Suite which was wonderful. Frederique the Manager and Monika the Assistant Manager made our return stay very very comfortable indeed and we loved every minute. This hotel offers such a wonderful experience so different to any other offer available in London and is a really great  place to stay. We had afternoon tea there this time which was very nice indeed and enjoyed the canapes in the early evening, as did our son's who joined us early evening. Location is wonderful and the service offered by all the staff is really first class. Hope to return again for another special occasion."
June 2012,Excellence Personified...with one exception.,"Monica, Remus and Stephan a huge hug and thank-you for the excellent experience!  As an avid international traveler amongst the Sofitel's, Ritz Carlton's and Four Season's this experience was exceptional.  The service was spot-on and the staff was tremendous.  I would be heartbroken to stay at any other property in London.  As every room is different Monica ensured that ""pickier"" tastes were satisfied and proceeded to show me three different rooms that varied in size and views of the city.  We found the perfect room and appreciated the soap menu and pillow menus' which were promptly delivered after ordering.  Although expensive, breakfast was phenomenal.  No comparison and almost worth the 25 pound admission.  Although the bar is well stocked I have a serious problem with Hotel…"
March 2012,Great hotel,"Stayed here few nights with some of my friends and had lovely experience. Very good hotel, clean and tidy cosy rooms,spacious bathrooms, excellent service and helpful staff. The rooms are of a decent size and very well cleaned, sheets were cleaned and towels were changed daily. Highly recommended!"
July 2012,One word...Fabulous!,"By far, Hotel 41 is our favorite hotel EVER! The service is impeccable and the property (location, amenities and rooms) is amazing. We were treated like royalty. The staff could not do enough for us and treated us like we were the only guests in the hotel. Penhaligon's toiletries (my personal favorite) were a nice touch. This hotel is simply top notch luxury!!! We will most definitely be bck soon!"
July 2012,Incredible service,"Can't recommend it highly enough. Nothing is too much trouble, the staff to guest ratio is very high, the Executive Room is a beautiful, lounge, particularly in the winter, with the log fire going, The pantry bar is great, scones and clotted cream all afternoon, penhaligons toiletries and bottles and bottles of it. We stayed in a split level junior suite - great feeling of space, but a bit inconvenient to have to keep walking up and down the stairs to fetch water etc. Probably would not pay the extra next time for the suite, but would stay in  standard double instead. It was very very noisy from the traffic outside, central London location notwitstanding. The bathroom was beautifully finished and the quality of the bed linen superbe. Glass of champagne of arrival, never a…"
June 2012,Amazing service,"The rooms are nice but the best part of this hotel is the service! Every time you go into the executive lounge they are extremely helpful and willing to help in any way they can. We had planned our restaurants beforehand, but if you are not a pre-planner they will be very helpful. The food and drinks in the lounge are also great, an amazing breakfast as well!"
May 2012,Surprising,"I've stayed in Five Star hotels from Honolulu to Helsinki and beyond - NEVER have I been  treated as well as I was at the 41 last week.  I've book conferences at hotels with more than 100 people and never been treated this well by the staff.  The 41 team is simply the best I have encountered in 30 plus years of travel.  I do not typically write reviews, but  Fred, Stefan, Monica, Viktoria and all of the 41 team were so efficient and genuinely engaging I wanted to share our experience.  We called from the airport saying we were in the arrival lounge and wanted to know when we could access our rooms.  The plan was to drop our bags and tour London a bit.  The instant reply was come right away, we will accommodate you.  Good sign.  We stepped out of the cab to be greeted by…"
June 2012,Shhhh - keep it a secret!,"We stay here twice a year on our birthdays. We hand over the kids to grandparents and thoroughly indulge ourselves.  From the minute you walk through the understated entrance you are treated like royalty.  Nothing is too much for the staff and they exceed expectations.  From the birthday cake in the room to the fabulous ""anything/anytime""  button on the wall.  The huge bed and amazingly comfortable bedding ensures a great nights sleep.  It exudes elegance and is always calming and quiet.  Breakfast is a feast, the Eggs Benedict to die for.  Please don't tell anyone, this can be our little secret ;-)"
June 2012,Best service in the world,"From the moment our family arrived we were treated to the most welcoming, friendly, and professional yet easygoing service from Magda, Stef, Frederic and the rest of the intimate Hotel 41 team. In fact, Magda is so warm she can summon sunlight to shine through the skylight! The beds and pillows are super comfy; the library is a relaxing place for reception, breakfast, and just hanging out; and the food, from breakfast to snacks to hors d'oeuvres to free late night feasts, is delicious. No wonder this is the #1 rated hotel in London and that folks like us will find reasons to visit London just to return to Hotel 41."
June 2012,Second Review,"We were only meant to stay here once on a return trip to London shortly having moved abroad, from London. I think we have stayed here eight or nine times now in a little under three years and I still keep trying to find reasons why we have to go to London. 'What do you mean they are changing the guard again? Best go back then and stay at the 41'.   Wonderful staff. The rooms seem to get better. My best bit? Every time you go there are examples of changes, ever so slight, but nonetheless changes that have been subtly suggested by guests and the hotel staff have listened. Amazing.    My only downside is, being a frequent visitor, the menu doesn't change. I would love to see a revitalised menu. I thank you."
June 2012,Exceptional,"Hotel 41 is truly an exceptional hotel.  It exudes character and charm in a wonderful area of London.  The true masterpiece of the hotel however, is the staff.  My wife and I stayed for 4 nights and could not have been more impressed by every member of the staff.  Whether you are traveling with children, traveling casually, or traveling formally you will be treated as another reviewer noted ""like royalty"".  Would highly recommend this exceptional hotel.  EMD"
June 2012,Fantastic hotel,"Beautiful hotel - stayed for a very short break for anniversary prior to going on holiday. Staff were incredibly helpful and the hotel itself was lovely. Huge bed, very lush bedding and great bathroom. Everything that you would want in a hotel room, with a really impressive level of service."
June 2012,Fabulous Boutique Hotel,"41 is an elegant, intimate boutique hotel, sitting just down the street from Buckingham Palace.  My family just returned from a four night stay there and it exceeded our expectations.  41 occupies the fifth floor of its sister hotel, The Rubens, yet has its own entrance and lobby.  The decor is all black and white, with dark woods and brass, and is very tasteful and beautiful.  We were thrilled that, unlike most every other hotel we contacted in London, 41 was willing to put our three children in one suite.  (Apparently, a maximum of two to a room is the norm in much of Europe, and we were faced with the prospect of having to incur the cost of a third room on top of the already high daily rates resulting from our weak dollar).  My husband and I were in a room next door which had…"
June 2012,Can I live here?,"Can't wait to return.  Staff amazing, rooms comfy, location superb.  Stephan Ott made our stay over the top.  Didn't lift a finger.  Food awesome.  "
June 2012,Awesome!,"My husband and I spent three days at 41 during the Jubilee celebrations in June.  From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty, lots of special touches, ie champagne, flowers, fruit basket and excellent service.  Our room was large and well appointed with a very comfy bed.  Breakfast was a feast with good food and white table cloth service.  The hotel is well situated to walk to all the sights and there were lots of good restaurants close by.  I would highly recommend this property to anyone traveling to London, you will love the staff they work very hard to make your visit special."
May 2012,Perfect London Hotel if you want service and pampering,"Hotel 41 is simply divine. But it’s not the fabulous rooms, the amazing Executive Lounge, the exclusivity of it that makes this hotel simply stunning. It’s the level of service almost unparalleled in any other London Hotel that makes this place exceptional.  We came to Hotel 41 for 10 days for the Diamond Jubilee celebrations and for London in general. We wanted luxury, pampering and a great location. Hotel 41 is right across the road from Buckingham Palace, and about one block from Victoria tube station. Check-in was smooth and professional, and it started the way it went for the whole of our stay – everyone knew our name and we were never anonymous. We were treated professionally but with personal attention and always with a smile. Perfect.  First the rooms. We had a Junior…"
June 2012,A great experience !,"I chose this hotel for a trip to London to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday having done a fair amount of research on the internet. From the moment we arrived we were very well treated by the team, in particular Magdalena, who ensured we had all the necessary information for our stay.  When we arrived we were handed a glass of Champagne as we registered. The room itself was very comfortable and had real character. Nothing was too much trouble and for us the level of service struck just the right balance. We are now looking forward to booking a return visit later in the year !"
March 2012,"Sorry, rip off.","I booked this hotel on Costco Travel.  It sounded too good to be true.  This is NOT a five star hotel by any stretch of the imagination.  It is a wanna-be.  The restaurant part of the package is horrid in the library at Ruebens. Hotel 41 is only the 5th floor next to the Reuben's and the floor above us was very noisy with kids and lots of creaks and cracks.  Save your money for a real five star.  I would give this 3 star at best.  The wifi is intermittent and the free drinks and appetizers at cocktail hour does not include any alcohol.  This package is fine for the non experienced traveler, but all others find somewhere else as you will be happier.  The staff here was friendly but too intrusive.  Read the fine print.  Sorry for the lousy review but let others be forewarned.  As…"
June 2012,Most memorable stay,"My wife and I staed at 41 in March 2012 and had a wonderful time. It was our second stay at 41 and at the end of our first stay we said that the service was amazing, the food great but our room was a bit small. Well, on check in at the start of our second stay we were absolutely delighted to find that they had given us a bigger room (with no complaining just a reference in our check out review). We  were treated to the usual amazing service during the  stay but I must confess the topper was on my birthday when without requesting it, the staff gave us the romantic turndown (look it up) without notice and without charge!! I have never stayed at a hotel that has read my mind on what I wanted and did it before I could ask like 41. Iwish all hotels were this amazing. Please stay here…"
May 2012,Wonderful experience!,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for 2 nights during the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations and picked it specifically because of its great location (right next to Buckingham Palace) and the excellent reviews we’d read on Trip advisor. We'd stayed at another Red Carnation Hotel previously (The Milestone) and enjoyed the experience so much we thought it couldn’t get any better but we were wrong!  The team at 41 really do make this hotel rank as the best we’ve ever stayed in.  The service was truly exceptional and is what we’ve talked about most to anyone who’d listen since we got back home! From the minute we arrived until we left, everyone we met treated you like a member of the family rather than a hotel guest.  A special mention goes out to Frederic, Monika and Malcolm, all of whom…"
June 2012,"Great Service, Small Rooms","I am surprised that this hotel gets such great reviews on tripadvisor.  The service is exceptional, but the rooms are very small and claustrophobic.  The window from the room we had looked right out at another building.  The room was quite small, and we felt as if we had no space to move around much. The air conditioner made the room freezing when it was on, but it soon got hot when it was off.  There seemed to be no way to control it, so we had to operate it manually by turning it on and off.  We could also hear the people talking in the narrow hallway leading to the rooms and in the room next to us. The hotel is really one exclusive floor of rooms in the Rubens Hotel.  It has a very nice executive lounge where you can go to have drinks and snacks in the evening.  The snacks…"
June 2012,If I could live here....,"I have relied on tripadvisor for years without ever even thinking of leaving a review (I was even always suspicious that hotel staff wrote the reviews!).  Now I am writing a review for a hotel that I haven't even checked out of yet!  This hotel experience is by far and away the most wonderful I have ever had - and I have had a lot of great ones!  The service is indescribable...the staff knows you by name the minute you arrive and treats you like family, anticipating things you didn't even know you needed!  The rooms are plush and comfortable - with small touches everywhere you look and special treats dropped off while you are away.  You feel like you have become a member of an exclusive club with an intimate library and well-stocked 24-hour ""pantry""  - check out the hotel's own…"
June 2012,Our 2nd Visit and even better than the first,"My wife and I returned here and this time we stayed in a Junior Suite which was wonderful. Frederique the Manager and Monika the Assistant Manager made our return stay very very comfortable indeed and we loved every minute. This hotel offers such a wonderful experience so different to any other offer available in London and is a really great place to stay. We had afternoon tea there this time which was very nice indeed and enjoyed the canapes in the early evening, as did our son's who joined us early evening. Location is wonderful and the service offered by all the staff is really first class. Hope to return again for another special occasion."
May 2012,Simply superb,"We stayed at Hotel 41 in early June.  We based our stay at hotel 41 because of the reviews on Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed in any regard.  We selected an Executive Double room for our 6 night stay. Their attention to detail was marvelous.  The staff has obviously been highly trained.  They were able to answer any questions we had and always went one step beyond to make us feel ""right at home."" The beds were very comfortable. Both the room and the bathroom were done in black and white and large by London standards.  Both were well appointed.  Our morning breakfast was always excellent. During our 6 day stay we worked our way through the Breakfast menu.  Service was always outstanding. As worldwide travelers, we would easily recommend this hotel as one of the finest…"
June 2012,Exceeded our expectations,"We loved, loved, loved our stay at Hotel 41.  The staff were incredibly accommodating and friendly.  They greeted us by name and it is really nice to feel so remembered.  The room was comfortable and the turn-down service was a real treat.  Their breakfasts (both Continental and Full English) are INCREDIBLE as is their afternoon tea.  The location was perfect, the service was extraordinary and our trip was unforgettable.  Thank you, 41!!  I hope to come back soon."
April 2012,Amazing experience,"Hotel 41 is the best experience I've ever had at a hotel in the United States or abroad. I can't talk enough about the staff because they are what makes the experience so memorable. Every member of the staff goes out of their way to help you in any way they can, from arrival to departure. They are happy to help plan your trip and give advice on what to see and when to see it, and also place reservations at restaurants and theaters. They make special occasions a top priority. It was wonderful. The hotel is simply beautiful and the lounge is such a nice place to sit and relax or enjoy some snacks! Another nice thing is that, with the hotel being on the 5th floor, it is very quiet at night because the street is far away. If I ever have the opportunity again, I would choose Hotel 41…"
April 2012,26 hours of as close to perfection as possible...,"There is so much I could write about this stay but to start with this was the best 24 hours (26 in fact) I've ever spent in a hotel!   I'll briefly start with a couple of small improvement areas - 1) the TV cabinet is mirrored and if you're not careful you could break the mirror as the door opens on to the fireplace, 2) black out blinds would be better as in the morning the room was a bit too light and 3) a bigger TV would be ideal (and would fit in the TV cabinet)  Apart from these points everything else was pretty much perfect. There isn't huge amounts I can add to the other reviews but I'll give it a go! My immediate reaction upon spotting the 41 canopy was I'm not too sure about this location as it's on a busy road but I needn't have worried. We were greeted on the ground…"
April 2012,Best guest service ever,"I imagine that people who spend thousands to stay in the best suites of the best hotels get treated like this regularly, but being accustomed to being just a ""regular joe"" staying in an average room, I have never experienced the kind of personalized customer service that we experienced at this hotel.  One morning at breakfast, my daughter saw a tray of blackberries wheeling by, and said, to no one in particular, ""yum!""  30 seconds later a bowl of blackberries was in front of her.  Another 30 seconds later and the food services manager is asking her if she's ""opposed to whip cream,"" and, upon receiving a negative answer, comes back with a gorgeous blackberry/whip cream smoothie he'd just made for her.  We went to Cornwall for a few days and then came back, and everyone greeted us…"
March 2012,second to none - simply the best experience in London - ever!,"as experienced travellers we  had high expectations - all of them were fulfilled and even surpassed. It started in The cosy lobby with warm handshakes, superb check-in service by 2 georgious ladies with a fantastic sense of humour to our fantastic suite. They assisted with any of of needs from reservations, limo rental etc - we felt immediately at home and highly appreciated the quitness of the hotel (it has only rooms at toplevel).  We will back - the sooner the better."
April 2012,THE place to stay in London!,"After spending the night with a friend and parents at Hotel 41 for my 18th, I have to agree with every other review written about the hotel. It is definitely the place to stay in London, the service is exceptional, from the moment we arrived to the moment we left everything was catered for (even a rose for me to give to mum on Mother's day, to Julien checking we had found the hair dryer in our room!). The room was lovely, and being greeted with a glass of champagne on arrival would go down well with anyone im sure! It was all the small touches that made our stay so enjoyable (like being given a little birthday cake with afternoon tea!) All the staff were willing to help with anything, again, Julien was more than helpful finding information about going out in London, even putting…"
April 2012,If Only There Was A 6 Star Rating... Utter Perfection,"The Hotel 41 was, in short, the best hotel I have ever stayed at, and saying that does not come lightly. The hotel is beyond words- the stay was as close to perfect as you will get, anywhere in the world. There are hotels then there is the Hotel 41- it is like having a home on Buckingham Palace Road, not just a room or suite to stay in. The hotel staff become like family, or at the very least a 'team' you have in London which you can depend on, and never need to think twice about making the most out of world requests, some which you would never make anywhere else. For someone who has experienced some of the best hotels in the world, none, and I mean none, come close to offering what the Hotel 41 offers. Forget the fact that this there is a beautiful, balanced ambiance of a…"
March 2012,Simply stunning,"What do i say that has not been written before? I have worked in the Hotel industry for 20 years and have stayed pretty much all over the world, Hotel 41 and the team are so good , in fact good is not the right word. Perfect. Nothing to much trouble, everything as you would expect, everything that you read is true. I often find it difficult to relax and turn off whilst staying at any hotel as it feels like a im working myself, but this stay was just perfect, to the point i relaxed completely.  Check in was very personal , the room ""  a suite"" was well laid out and very clean, the turndown on the first night and birthday cake was a nice surprise and the lounge and plundering the pantry really added a beautiful personal touch to the stay.  Frederic and the team really pushed the…"
March 2012,"""Our best choice ever""","For our recent stay in London , we had selected Hotel 41, mainly because it was a small boutique hotel, properly located and nicely decorated from what we could see on the hotel’s internet site. It was also amongst the Condé Nast Traveler Gold list.   To our great surprise, this was our best selection ever for an hotel, not only in UK but from all our previous travel around the world! Of course, the hotel is very well located, quiet, small and cosy; that is what you should expect from this category. But what really makes the big difference is the quality of service and the pampering attention received from the staff members. The team was always warm and made us feel like in our own manor in London !  We can only recommend it to anyone looking for a “difference” when travelling…"
April 2012,Service beyond compare!,"I have quite simply never stayed in a hotel with such attentive and considerate staff.  They knew all of our names from the moment we arrived. I loved that all the rooms were on the same floor. It made the hotel feel small, intimate, cozy and sophisticated."
April 2012,Sweet satisfaction,"Like many others on this page, I'm not a regular reviewer of hotel experiences.  However, I'm more than happy to report on a wonderful stay at Hotel 41. Every aspect of the hotel exceeded our expectations.   Service:  The service, which is justly lauded on here, made our trip to London incredibly relaxing, which is not something I've been able to say of the city before. It really is a question of 'Whatever, whenever'. If the cost of staying here makes you hesitate, remember that this adds value beyond what any normal hotel can offer. As a one-off experience, or an occasional treat, it would be hard to beat.   Rooms:  Beautiful though admittedly compact. The most comfortable bed I've ever slept in.   Food:  Wonderful. We ended up getting back quite late so opted to Plunder the…"
April 2012,A totally magical end to our wedding weekend,"We booked Hotel 41 as it's rated as number 1 here on TripAdvisor...and we weren't disappointed!  WOW - what a fantastic experience.  On arrival our car was whisked off to be parked and we were greeted by Roman at the front door. We then went up to the Executive Lounge to check in, where, once they found out we had just got married, we were given complimentary champagne. The Executive Lounge is a great place to relax, and we ended up sitting in here for an hour before we even went to our room. Magda and Frederic were fantastic and offered us a reduced rate to upgrade to room 4104 - the Conservatory Master Suite - an amazing room with a glass roof to see up to the stars at night. We were then brought a bottle of champagne and cake to celebrate our marriage.  We hadn't booked…"
June 2011,The service in Hotel 41 is very special!!,"The rooms in this hotel are small, but very confortable!! The service is very good and special!!! The breakfast is good. We liked the hotel, but the location isn't the best."
May 2012,Top Notch,Top place. Really good views and food was top notch too. Would recommend to anyone thinking of staying here. Great location too
September 2011,A perfect pocket in London!,"My husband took me to 41 for my Birthday, just lovely! How refreshing to find a hotel which ticks all the boxes, just super to stay somewhere fabulous and to be made to feel we were absolutely welcome too! Monika checked us in with a glass of Champagne, our room was great with all the smashing extras in the bathroom. After the matinee, we returned to our room to find a floating candle glowing away, lights dimmed, music playing and a Birthday cake.. Magical touches! We had a bottle of Veuve in the lounge and along came canapés. The following day the sun was still shining, so walked up to The Palace before heading back for breakfast (serve until 1pm on sundays) We enjoyed London, ate at Scotts then back to 41 by 9pm, my husband read the papers, i watched television.. Happy to…"
May 2012,Fails on a value for money basis,"It's like expecting a trip in a Rolls Royce and then being ferried around in a Toyota, even though you've paid Rolls Royce rates.  This place lacks typical hotel infrastructure and must be very cheap to run.  There is little character and atmosphere.  The big trick is how the staff like Monica and Magda are constantly all over you, distracting you from pondering the shortcomings.   In other words, the chauffeur of the Toyota tries to make the trip worthwhile.  You will never find royalty, captains of industry, movie stars or such people staying here - it simply lacks too much to be in their sights. I think that this place is very poor value for money and would find many better alternatives at the price point."
May 2012,Didn't want to leave,"This hotel was the perfect find.  The amenities are excellent, attention to detail impressive, and the service is fabulous.  Everything was so wonderful that we decided to extend our stay at the expense of non refundable travel tickets.  We will definitely be back."
May 2012,Impeccable service,"My wife, daughter, and I spent a brief stay at Hotel 41 during a recent stop over in London.  From the moment we arrived, Frederic, Magda, and the entire staff could not have been more pleasant and helpful.  We have stayed at several 5-star hotels in the past, and as far as service is concerned, I can't say I have ever had better than what we received at Hotel 41.  The building that the hotel is in is over 100 years old.  As you can imagine, the rooms are a bit smaller than newer hotels, but the entire property is very nicely appointed with all the modern conveniences.  We received a complimentary upgrade to a Hospitality Suite with a king bed, and my daughter loved having her own ""room"" with a fold-out couch.  The Executive Lounge is a great place for breakfast or snacks…"
April 2012,Very Nice,"Great service, food, room and location.  Close to the tube, tourist attractions, many restaurants and of course Buckingham Palace."
May 2012,41 Hotel is the Best!,"My wife and I stayed with two nine year old twins, daughter (25) and son (28) this past April. While the London weather was stormy, the staff made our stay perfect. Monika, Victoria and Roman all did a fabulous job and could not have done more to make us all feel welcome and special.  We’ve stayed at most of the big London hotels (Savoy, Four Seasons, Mandarin, Claridge’s, etc) as well as the smaller boutiques (The Berkley, Blakes, etc), and the 41 Hotel is a gem amongst them. It’s small, intimate and situated in a perfect location in Mayfair. The rooms were fabulous and well equipped. The Executive lounge reminds us of visiting a friend’s English country house. But most of all, the staff is exceptional; friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and no task is too large or small, to…"
May 2012,Pure pleasure!,"My third stay at Hotel 41 and it was perfect! Upon check-in in the beautiful library lobby I received a complimentary upgrade to a king size room without asking and a refreshing flute of champagne. The staff was as expected, delightful, attentive, helpful and anticipated my every need-including finding the boutique shop that sold a favorite brand of French clothing :)  The location is suberb and we walked everywhere and were happy to return to a pleasant dinner in front of the fireplace in the library dining area.  The room was comfortable and well-appointed and I awoke rested for another hectic fun-filled day in London.  We'll always stay at Hotel 41.  Kudos to Frederic and his staff for making my trip pure pleasure."
April 2012,We felt like we were a guest in a beautiful home,"This small hotel was our home away from home in London. Thanks Freddie, Madga, Jasmeet and all of the staff at 41 for making my husband's birthday trip so wonderful.The room with the king size bed, food and service was excellent. We will have to come up with some excuse to return to London to stay at this wonderful hotel again."
May 2012,a wonderful place to stay,What can one say when one finds perfection - that sums up our experience at the hotel 41.From the moment we were picked up by their arranged service at heathrow to the warm personal goodbye at checkout everything was wonderful. Other reviews have gone into the rooms and amenities and food and all and these reviews were totally true. To me what makes the hotel so unusual in todays day and age is the degree of detail that goes into making the guest feel so very very special including anniversary celebrations and any and all special requests.One special example was remembering we were going to see the musical singin in the rain and that night having the cd playing as part of the turn down service when we returned.The whole staff led by general manager Frederic and Assistant Manager…
April 2012,Staff and location make the stay worthwhile....,"We read all the reviews online about 41 and they were the major reason we chose it. If you've ever stayed in a suite at the Bellagio or at the Ritz Carlton on the club level.......it's NOTHING like that. They basically took the 5th floor of the adjoining Rubens Hotel and made 28 rooms into a boutique hotel. We chose an Executive King room, which is an upgrade from the standard rooms, and it was very nicely furnished, immaculately clean, and had everything we needed. Certainly small by U.S. standards, but we expected as much in London.  The location speaks for itself. Just outstanding. A very short walk to the Palace, parks, shopping, eateries, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, and even the London Eye if you're up for a longer stroll. What makes this place is the staff and service. It…"
April 2012,A great discovery,"We usually stay at the Chesterfield Hotel but on our last trip the Chesterfield was full (we had changed our plans last minute)  and the Staff very kindly arranged a room for us a room at Hotel 41. We thought the Hotel was lovely particularly the lounge area. We were greeted with a glass of champagne when checking in and the staff were very efficient, attentive and accommodating and seemed to have a genuine feeling of pride in the Hotel. We stayed in one of the Hospitality Suites which was very nice.  The only small negative comment I would make is that the room had so much furniture it it there wasn't much room to move around  in or put suitcases etc but that seems to be typical of London Hotels and it certainly would not stop me returning to this hotel. The Management and…"
May 2012,Top of the Line Hotel,"I stayed at Hotel 41 for three nights and it was fabulous.  The room was spacious compared to other Englsh rooms, and the amenities were incredible - everything you would expect and more including a TV in the bathroom, robes, slippers, and a great turndown service.  The lounge was wonderful, an the service was excellent.   The staff was very attentive.  If you decide to stay here, be prepared to be pampered.  The personal attention is a little ""over the top"" compared to soe American hotels and takes some getting used to, but everyone was friendly and courteous to the extreme.  Hotel 41 is within easy walking distance of Buckingham Palace and St James Park, and there are some nice pubs and shops right around the corner.  We were given excellent suggestions for dinner and…"
May 2012,Loved and hated in equal measure,"My husband precisely described my feelings about this hotel when he said ""I loved and hated it in equal measure"".   Hotel 41 has many admirable aspects. Obviously the location is fantastic. The decor is marvellous, with beautiful wall coverings, rich woods and thoughtfully chosen accessories. The bedroom which we stayed in was very well appointed with every need anticipated. We slept soundly in great comfort in the huge bed. I particularly enjoyed the wonderful rain shower. The linens, bathrobes and towels were all of the most luxurious quality. They provide, as frequently mentioned, lots of lovely snacks. We were given a beautiful cake.   Hotel 41 disappointed us with their style of service. I appreciate that this is converse to many other reviews. I really feel that the…"
April 2012,"Fabulous, best hotel in London","My wife and I decided to stay at Hotel 41 on a recent stop over in London. Right from the very moment we arrived we were made to feel very welcome and special. This trip was to celebrate my wife's 40th birthday, we were going on from here on the Orient Express to Venice, so I had tried to plan everything to the extreme. I must have called over a dozen limousine companies, all of which were hopeless, so I decided to call the hotel and ask their advise. Magda rang the limo company, got a price for me and organised it all within 10 minutes!!  The hotel is spotlessly clean, well appointed and in an ideal location to tour the city. Our room was comfortable, quiet and reasonably priced for a hotel of it's calibre. The little touches that we received during our short stay were lovely…"
May 2012,Amazing place!,"Having stayed at many hotels around the world, this is definitely one of the very best! It's intimate surroundings, excellent and beautiful rooms, and the friendliest and most helpful team in place (the best of any hotel I have ever stayed at), make it my number 1 preferred place to stay whenever I am in London.   Whenever I needed help with restaurant reservations, transport, or just receiving a package on my behalf, the staff was helpful in every aspect. Frederic the manager personally greeted every guest he met and made sure everything ran smoothly.   The lounge where breakfast is served is also perfect for light meals or even just having drinks with your friends or guests. While it is a great place to relax year-round, I especially like the lounge in the heart of winter,…"
May 2012,Royal Treatment,"I stayed at Hotel 41 for a business trip and have to say that it has THE best service and some of the most beautiful rooms I've ever seen. The rooms are large compaired to most hotels in the UK.  Champagne checking in, little treats and snacks left in my room and a cooler filled with wine and snacks to enjoy in the executive lounge were a pleasure to have - all part of the 'royal treatment'. I really can't say enough about the staff... from the moment I walked into the hotel to the moment I left, they were wonderful - very warm and welcoming as you can read from everyone else's reviews. The cleaning staff found an IPAD my co-worker left behind in his room and returned it to him just as we were leaving the hotel (after checking out).  Situated directly across from the Buckingham…"
May 2012,very nice hotel,"We just stayed in Hotel 41 for two nights and enjoyed our stay very much ! The room was big enough (compared to other hotel rooms in London), location is great, people are very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is good!  Nicole and Riccardo"
February 2012,excellent!,"41 Hotel is a small boutique hotel a couple of blocks away from Victoria station and Buckingham Palace. The room size is very good for european standards. Very clean too. The staff is extremely attentive. They were really nice! Breakfast was very good. I think this is a special hotel for couples, very quiet, private and comfortable. I highly recommend it and would certainly stay again."
April 2012,"Hotel 41,London,UK",What a fantastic experience and pleasure to stay at 41.The Staff excelled in every way and by far one of the finest hotels.I travel the world and am yet to find a hotel to match 41.Well done to the Management and staff.Keep up the brilliant service and professionalism. Regards Mike Coburn
April 2012,Most Memorable Experience in my 28 Years,As a seasoned traveller I have spent many nights in London's five star hotels.  Having lived in London for the last four years I decided to treat myself to a stay at this wonderful establishment.  In my university years I used to travel through Victoria quite frequently and came across 41 at one point though never really thought about staying then.  Upon arrival at the property which is very well situated with easy access to public transport and an abundant selection of sights and museums(In my eighteen years here I finally made it to see Buckingham Palace).  When you enter the property you are greeted by a warm and friendly member of staff who will let the reception staff know (upstairs on the fifth floor).   Soon you are whisked to the executive lounge (do not let the name…
May 2012,Anniversary,This is a really top notch hotel with excellent service that goes beyond expectations. Very friendly without beeing intrusive. Very stylish with lots of well thought out designs. Worth the money for special occasions. To bad they could not rule over the weather also.
May 2012,A wonderful start to our trip,"We started our 3 week holiday in London, at Hotel 41. It was a perfect start to our trip, from the Range Rover transfer from Heathrow, to the champagne at check-in, we felt immediately welcomed. We stayed in the Conservatory Suite, with glass roof, and it was just lovely. We realized, much to our dismay, we had left our large camera behind on the plane. The hotel, particularly Remus, was instrumental in working with Virgin and ultimately getting our camera delivered to the hotel (much to our relief) the next morning.  Prior to our trip, we had asked the hotel to arrange Wicked tickets and had wonderful seats. We enjoyed snacks and wine in the executive lounge each evening, and enjoyed talking to the managers and staff.  The management team was outstanding, and very warm and…"
May 2012,Truly outstanding service,The common theme of most TA reviews is one of great service and this is truly the case. The staff here are exceptionally well trained and managed. They help and anticipate without this ever becoming burdensome. (one example was that they saw that my wife has mobility issues and changed the room they had planned to give us to one which was nearer the executive lounge). The food is good quality and the rooms are well decorated and laid out. I was really looking forward to staying at 41 and this sometimes builds expectations that are not met. I am very pleased to say that this was not the case with Hotel 41. We will be back.....
May 2012,Wow!,"We've had the great fortune to stay at some wonderful hotels in our travels.  We have to say that Hotel 41 takes the award for most personalized service.  The staff is attentive and friendly, every wish a traveler could have is anticipated, and anything you would want to pamper you is available by request if not already provided.  They had me at champagne as we checked in!  It only got better with the water, chocolates, slippers and linens by the bed at night, not to mention the candles lit in the bathroom.  They arranged tickets for the sites we wanted to visit and arranged transportation to the airport for us.  My husband and I had a wonderful time and will definitely stay here for every trip in London from now on!"
May 2012,Loved it!,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 last week and loved every day spent there. It is centrally located and less than a block from Victoria Station and literally steps away from Buckingham Palace.  From the minute we walked in, we were greeted by friendly staff at their first floor mini-lobby and escorted to check in on the fifth floor. Check in was very easy and straightforward and we were then escorted to our room and we were surprised by complimentary champagne and mini desserts. So lovely!  This was  perfect as my husband and I love anything sweet.   The room itself is small but well appointed-Bose station with ipod/iphone docking, flat screen wall mounted tv in the room & bathroom and free wi-fi. The bed is very comfortable but took up most of the space in the room but it…"
May 2012,Excellence among excellence,I have stayed at many 5 star hotels but this hotel is by far the best among them all. The staff are all about anticipating your needs. They are professional and personable but never intrusive. The attention to detail is incredible and nothing is to much trouble. You are always made to feel welcome and comfortable and the location is so handy to everthing. You are just a 2 minute walk to the undergroung and Buckingham palace is outside your door. I have staryed at many of the leading hotels in London but this hotel surpasses them all. The roomas are immaculate and well finished and the bathroom is generous and spotless. Treat yourself and enjoy all it has to offer.
March 2012,Great Service,We were welcomed like returning customers despite this being our first stay. All the staff were polite and attentive and the room was lovely.
May 2012,Lovely stay,"We've stayed at this hotel for my husband birthday for 2 nights in March. The hotel is situated not even 10 minutes walk. The location is brilliant and it's just next to Buckingham palace. Great for London sightseeing!  The entrance of the hotel can be surprising as it's a small door and a little desk and a corridor. But it didn't bother us.  You are then taken to the main lounge where the check in is done as well as being the breakfast & lounge area. It is beautifully decorated and loads of natural lights. When I've booked the room, I had a choice to pick of several extras. I've decided to go for the high tea. The high tea was lovely and the staff very polite and nice. We've requested an early check-in if possible and when we arrived the room was available.  The hotel is small…"
May 2012,Reality check is in order - this is not the real deal!,"When you’re top of the pile on a global site like Trip Advisor, you get the privilege of charging premium rates on the basis that people will be willing to pay more for the perception of a superior offering.  That weight of expectation can be a burden and may result in far more thorough analysis than would otherwise be necessary.  In other words, discerning travellers will expect you to deliver.  The overwhelmingly positive reviews persuaded me to stay here for 3 nights.  For just about £400 per night, I was paying the same that could have got me into the Ritz, Savoy, Langham or Claridges.  Was it going to be worth it and what would the experience be like?  First Impressions: There is no entrance area or lobby.  In fact there is nothing but a passage to a lift which takes you up…"
March 2012,My favourite hotel ever,We have just returned from our second stay at 41.  Everything about the hotel is absolutely perfect.  I almost don't want to give them another good review as it'll be impossible to get reservations if everybody finds out how fabulous this place is!
May 2012,justified,"believe all the good reviews! Stayed here for our wedding anniversary and were completely blown away by the service, luxury and location. Frederik and all the staff were beyond brilliant. Cannot think of anything that would improve this hotel apart from the few things I mentioned to Frederik which were rectified immidiately. I you want something special, this is the place to go!"
May 2012,A perfection of timing,"Another lovely stay at 41, and this time we were on a tight schedule.  We were guests at a formal occasion nearby, during which there was an interlude.  41 is for residents only, but we had asked if we could invite our hosts to visit us briefly and privately in our suite for refreshments as this was a special day.  We arranged for champagne, fruit and snacks to be left in our suite for our  mid-event half hour.  When we arrived, the whole suite had been serviced, although we were checking out that day, so our friends were able to freshen up in a gleaming bathroom free of our used towels and soap and without passing a rumpled bed. The requested refreshments were beautifully presented (berries of superb quality alongside the famous home- toasted nuts) in the downstairs sitting…"
May 2012,Exceptional,"This place is ranked #1 in London on TripAdvisor for good reason - I've never felt more welcome at a hotel.  The accommodations, service, food and staff were impeccable.  Every details is well thought out, from the champagne reception to the late-night snack bar.  I highly recommend  this beautiful hotel for any special occasion."
April 2012,Exceptional Boutique Hotel,"Frederic Dallot, resident manager and his assistant Monica are the dynamic duo! Their attention to detail and friendly caring attitude made our stay at 41 memorable. Their level of service is exemplary. Having stayed at some of the finest hotels in the world, we can say with confidence that  you can not be treated better anywhere. The rooms are charming and romantic; we celebrated our 40th anniversary in style. Next year, we plan on celebrating our 41st at 41."
May 2012,What a Gem,My husband and I enjoyed yet another stay at 41. Frederic and his staff go to great lenghts to ensure that everything is perfect. Do try the romantic turndown and the Butlers pantry.
April 2012,A very nice boutique hotel providing an exceptionally high level of service.,"Charmingly unassuming from the pavement, 41 is a delight from the moment you step inside. Upon entering staff provide a friendly welcome, with the Front Desk Manager escorting you to the 5th floor haven above Buckingham Palace Road. A glass of Champagne is offered on arrival to the Lounge, where check-in formalities are completed efficiently (and with a personal touch).  The ‘Executive Room’ (18 square metre variant) was well appointed, with nice attention to detail – from the ’41’ embroidered linen and towels, to the Penhaligon toiletries in the bathroom. The turndown service was personable.  The ‘Executive Lounge’ was impressive, with the feel of a private club from a bygone age. Providing a personal welcome, by name, I found service was attentive whilst discrete.  Whilst it…"
April 2012,Fantastic stay,"Booked this as an overnight stay because of the fantastic reviews on Trip Adviser, it met and exceeded our expectations.  This is definitely THE place to stay in London. Amazing rooms, super staff, nothing too much trouble. Would definitely recommend to anyone and am looking forward to a return visit."
February 2012,we will be returning,"To anyone looking for a hotel which is right in the heart of london and can claim 10/10 from clients then hotel 41 is for you. the service, staff , maids and those behind the scenes makes this hotel in the category of excellent. The effort they went to for arranging dinner bookings in restaurants that were booked out was fantastic - thank you. We will be returning.B.W. australia"
April 2012,Great hotel for Holiday,"Spent 2 nights in London with Hotel 41 was a beautiful time to me. The hotel had a wonderful location (very close to the Buckingham Palace and the St James Park). The stylish and well appointed and exceptionally clean rooms made the hotel really a great place to relax after long journey. There was a pool in the hotel which just made me want to jump into it right away. The staff was so hospitality, friendly, willing to response to any of our requests. The hotel really made me feel that I am at home not in a strange place. Come and stay with the hotel, you will experience the best service ever."
April 2012,Truly exceptional hotel.,"I stayed here for two nights in April. The warm staff makes you feel like you've entered a welcoming club from the moment you first enter the ""hidden"" entry. The library is simply amazing, as is the staff. I think they all knew my name within 20 minutes of arrival. I will definitely return here on my next stop in London. "
April 2012,Old fashioned attention to service,I stayed for one night and found the whole experience excellent. As a regular user of 5 star hotels in London I can safely say this hotel ranks with the best. Small and unusual the whole focus is upon personal service from the moment you arrive through to the moment you leave.
April 2012,What a wonderful hotel!,"Decided to treat ourselves to a two night stay at ""41 "" as my partner was running his first London marathon and it was my birthday the following day.Having read the many glowing reviews all I can say is that I fully agree with them! All the staff made our stay very special and everyone was so friendly,"
April 2012,A Haven of Tranquillity and Charm,"Hotel 41 is at the centre of London's tourist hotspots but on entering the hotel guests are immediately in a calm, tranquil setting.  Reception, check-in, all guest rooms and dining areas are on the 5th floor, reached by lift. The lounge, where breakfast and light meals are served is lovely - shades of genteel grandeur. The staff, as many other reviewers have stated, are friendly, helpful and professional.  We were greeted with glasses of champagne, chocolates in the room, many extras.  We were made to feel like guests - rather than clients.  We were addressed by name and with a smile and nothing was overlooked. A very pleasant short break."
March 2012,"Best service ever, nothing too much trouble.","This was our second visit, the first our wedding night last year and this year for our first anniversary. To have a fantastic time yet in relaxed surroundings, this is a real treat.   This is a fabulous place, the only thing I would say is the rooms are smaller than expected but don't let that put you off as it is a real experience in service. Monika is wonderful."
March 2012,The Hidden Jewel in London's Crown,"Having read the recent reviews on trip advisor  we booked this hotel hoping , but not expecting , this to be as good as everyone says . Well it wasn't as good , it was BETTER !  From the unassuming entrance to the grandeur of the private club lounge feel , everything was wonderful . We were upgraded from a double to a king room which was a lovely surprise , this was black and white and overlooked The Royal Mews . The bathroom was big and had lovely toiletries. The location is excellent  as it is between Victoria train / tube station and Buckingham Palace and you can also stoll through the park to Picadilly CIrcus in approx 20 to 30 mins . The service is impeccable , nothing is too much trouble . After hearing it was my birthday they arranged a lovely tasty cake and a romantic…"
March 2012,Priceless,"Hotel 41 which was originally recommended by a friend many years ago when I was going to London on business and I decided after this last trip to write a review so others can learn about what I call one London's best kept secrets. Even people who live in London don't know about this amazing hotel.  I cannot say enough about the exceptional service and the quality of this hotel and its staff.  It is hidden away within the Rubens Hotel and the only place I will stay while I am in London.  Impeccably decorated, the hotel's Executive Lounge (reception) is a combination of an old world library that is a comfortable and elegant setting where you feel comfortable and cozy as opposed to the huge loud reception areas of most chain hotels. It is very private and secluded yet the…"
March 2012,exceeded expectations of this detail oriented traveler,"i am a generally detail conscious traveler and was very impressed by this hotel and it's staff from the first communication to the last. my husband and i combined a business and pleasure trip, and all of our needs were met and exceeded. the cappuccino here is excellent, as well as the afternoon tea service was quiet and delicious. i would recommend that travelers note that they can source the concierge next door at the rubens as needed. bravo to this hotel and i would definitely return."
March 2012,Best Service Ever,"I am a hotel Snob! I stay in hotels like the Four Seasons Egypt and The Setai 5th Avenue, New York. I don't write reviews cos I am very busy, but I had to write this one.The service in this hotel was better than amazing! The manager Frederic Dallot was a gem. He knows your name, he knows what you like from a simple conversation and he makes anything you need happen. My husband booked a night stay as an anniversary surprise and frederic handled every detail. From the cake upon arrival to the rose petals, candles and champagne when we got back from dinner which the hotel booked. He made sure my husband was aware of every detail like how long the candles burned for. I simply felt spoilt! Breakfast was really nice a choice of anything on the menu and a buffet. The bar is always…"
March 2012,Another superb weekend. The Gold Standard of hotels.,"Many thanks to Frederic and all the staff at the 41 for yet another excellent weekend in London. This hotel is like no other and it is really all down to the staff. Yes they are courteous and efficient as you would expect, but what makes the difference is, they are all so friendly; they really enjoy looking after you. From the moment you walk into the lobby, the first glass of champagne whilst checking in and relaxing in "" The Library "" you are in another world that is calm and warm and friendly. The rooms have everything you would expect and more. On our latest stay we had an upgraded  room / suite with 3 televisions!! We didn't watch any of them as there was too many other things to do. Food served in the lounge is 1st class, there is a good choice and the prices are very…"
March 2012,Wonderful Hotel,"I've stayed in hundreds of hotels and Hotel 41 provide the best service I can remember. Nothing is too much trouble and it's a pleasure for them to do.   The rooms are very small, or at least the one I stayed in, which wasn't the cheapest room. That is the biggest letdown, but on balance it doesn't matter. Everything else makes up for it. Even the cooked breakfast was fantastic too, everything was perfect and the ingredients were fresh and the food was delicious.   I wholeheartedly recommend Hotel 41."
March 2012,AMAZING!!!!,"We recently spent the weekend in London to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary, and I cant thank Frederic and his team enough for making it a truely memorable weekend. The room was gorgeous, as was the hotel and service. Being from South Africa, I also loved the little touches like having boerie for breakfast. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone, it was fabulous from start to finish."
July 2011,"""Whatever, whenever""","As a professional in the hospitality industry, I can only take my hat off to the team at Hotel 41! The level of comfort is very high, rooms and common areas (the lounge, lobby...) beautifully decorated and always spotless. However, what distinguishes 41 most from any other hotel I've visited is the level of service. Every member of staff does their best to ensure your stay is up to your expectations, and more. Efficient, but also extremely kind, courteous and genuinely good people.  In the lobby, you are offered instantly assistance as to organising transport, restaurant reservations etc. My girlfriend and I were welcomed by a charming young lady named Laura. Check-in, which is done champagne in hand in the executive lounge, with Magda was more like a chat with a friend than an…"
March 2012,Dissapointing,"This is a rather small hotel near Buckingham Palace area - great location . . I stayed there for 2 nights in July 20011. Shortly  ,  the place is Really  overpriced - I paid more than  £500 for a suite for one night expecting a really great place, altho the place has its charm  , the level of service and room i expect at that price is much higer.  Its all about expectation level:-)"
April 2012,"Excellent hotel, based on service","This is a boutique/small hotel in Buckingham Palace Rd, near Victoria, so position is great. Its right next to The Rubens Hotel, part of the same group. We had an executive king room (4117), which was very comfortable, though the lay-out was strange. Ceiling height must have been about 2m and as I am 1.95m tall this felt quite oppressive on entering. The A/C vent is directed from the wall directly at the right side of the bed, which was a little disconcerting during the night. The Bose soundwave bedside clock/radio was on a desk around a corner from the sleeping area and could not be seen and not heard well. One of the power points at the desk was faulty. The bed was very comfortable, room very quiet. Free wifi. Everything else worked well. Spacious bathroom - 2 showers, one…"
April 2012,3rd time in Paradise,"We keep coming back to London just to stay at this wonderful hotel. Being our 3rd time there we truly feel at home now and, as the staff is always so chatty and friendly it almost seems we go back there visiting some old friends. This time we were upgraded to the split level suite which is amazing...at the entrance you have a small tv room with a table where you can relax at evening or have breakfast in the morning, upstair you have the very spacious bedroom and the bathroom. We loved the suite and had enough space to have a couple massage in room! I also had make up and hair done in room and the artist recommended by the hotel was amazing. I am a messy person so asked for a lot of different bookings for restaurants and shopping and the hotel staff was amazing as always helping…"
April 2012,Made the wedding proposal magical,"Wonderful, friendly, conscientious and helpful staff made our stay in this beautiful hotel a fantastic experience. The room was lovely, especially when decked out with candles and rose petals!"
April 2012,"A lovely cosy atmosphere, and superb service","My wife and I hugely enjoyed our stay at '41' for 2 nights last weekend.    The property was not originally built as a hotel, so the rooms are not 'cookie cutter' copies of each other, and ours was quite small.  But, it was a complimentary upgrade from a standard Double, the fittings and contents of the room were well thought out, and the bed was huge and we slept in deep feathery comfort!  There are only around 30 rooms in the hotel, and the main public space is a large, bright and comfortable Library, with a cosy mezzanine level for extra privacy.  The small number of rooms, the numerous well trained staff, their attentive but not intrusive service and the fact that checkin, checkout, meals and the bar are all in this one lovely space gives the hotel a small, cosy, comfortable…"
March 2012,Above and beyond expectations,"I need a dictionary of superlatives to describe the experience here. Was it the chess game over canapes in the library lounge? Was it the complimentary overnight shoe shine service? Was it the offer of a choice of the next day's newspapers in multiple languages upon arrival? Was it the personalised card welcoming us to the hotel on our desk? Was it the Belgian chocolates and muesli bars available all day? Was it the surprise turndown service which saw our king size bed covered in rose petals? Thanks to the courteous, smiling and professional staff who outnumbered the guests, this is sure to be a highlight of any hotel stay. Couldn't recommend it highly enough."
March 2012,Birthday Treat,"After reading fantastic reviews on Hotel 41 my partner asked if i would like to stay for my Birthday we stayed from 11th-13th March as the 12th was my Birthday, we did a deal on line that included a 3 course meal at The Library at the Rubens hotel(which was fantastic) and a upgrade to a deluxe room,as soon as we walked through the door i knew we would love it, we was warmly greeted and from that moment to the end of our stay the staff couldn't do enough for us to make sure it was perfect in every way,we upgraded again on arrival(well,it was a treat) and and so pleased we did the room was beautiful and split on two levels champagne on ice was waiting for us,the evening of my birthday i returned to our room to find it lit with scented candles and rose petals scattered over both…"
March 2012,The best ever,"Me and my wife were looking for an outstanding boutique hotel in the very center of London, to spend few days with our 10 months daugther. Our main concern was to pick a superb accomodation possibly avoiding the luxurious clichés, vapid and stereotyped places, the likes of Dorchester and Savoy. Browsing the booking.com web site we discovered this small and outstanding hotel, impressed by the sober but fine and splendid black&white interior decoration. Then we sorted the hotels' list by review score and suddenly we noticed that in that moment the 41 was the only one to get the highest score (9.2).  We genuinely enjoyed to be guests at the stunning 41 and we are grateful to the management for the executive king size upgrade that was kindly prearranged for free, in order to let our…"
March 2012,A little place of heaven in a very busy city !!,"We stayed here for my daughter, Charlotte's, 18th birthday.  Charlotte found this hotel after days of looking on the internet for different hotels and I must say she has chosen well.  The service exceeded my expectations from the moment the door opened.  To be greeted on the door by a young happy and courteous man was wonderful. The staff here at the hotel are incredible and are able to communicate with all age groups.  Frederic (I hope I have spelt this correctly) was so helpful it was unlike anything I have experienced in London hotels.  Nothing was too much trouble and the hotel has a wonderful club lounge feel which actually makes you think you are somewhere completely different to a busy city.   When we arrived at our restaurant one evening in Regent Street  to find it…"
January 2012,very excellent,"I would like to thank Mr Frederic, Dhana, Monika and the other staff for the Great Great Great hospitality and welcoming. I have experienced the fabulous welcoming from the moment I have reserved the room, it was the first time in my hotels experience that such a hotel send me a forum to fell.They asked me about my preference and what I want them to prepare for me. once I arrived to the hotel they took me to the reception and ask me for any thing I would like to have while they sort me out. there where a complimentary snack and Tea in the lounge area for free. the lounge area is very nice and quite and classic. they toke me to the room no. 4114, and the lady has introduced the very nice room in a very nice way. As I was celebrating my 2nd wedding anniversary they have prepared a…"
March 2012,Thank you for a wonderful experience,"If you are prepared to pay for an intimate, cosy, and luxurious experience, Hotel 41 is the place to stay at. We have never felt more welcome and cared for than here. We have tried various hotels in London, and we will definitely return to Hotel 41. We were there for our wedding anniversary, and in the evening we entered our room, which was decorated with rose petals and candle lights all over the place. The staff is efficient, professional and polite; the rooms are wonderful, and the service is excellent."
October 2011,Another pleasant stay at 41,"Stayed here in 2009 after finding it on Tripadvisor as #1 hotel in London. When we decided to go back to London again for a few days in March 2012 our first choice was to come back to 41.  Ideal position to explore both the West End and museums etc.  Service is impeccable.  Staff are all extremely pleasant and helpful - nothing is too much trouble. Beautiful Anniversary cake on arrival, together with a red rose and rose petals on the bed that night (no extra charge!) - all because i mentioned our visit was for our anniversary when booking on the internet. Thoroughly recommended for a special stay. It is no wonder that it is #1 rated hotel in London."
March 2012,Great place to stay,"This is one of the best hotel i stayed in. Everything was just perfect. The room was very clean,tidy , very quiet. The staff was great, good communication , courtesy, empathy. I highly recommend this hotel."
March 2012,Fantastic,"We stay in London a lot, in both large and boutique hotels. Hotel 41 surpasses them all. Not only is the hotel beautiful but the staff couldn't have been more attentive. My only recommendation to the hotel is please invest in larger tv's. My husband and I decided to spend the evening in the hotel which is something we never do because we wanted to make the most of our night at the hotel and the television is rather small for the size of room. But that is the only negative point in what is a truly wonderful hotel"
March 2012,Outstanding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,When looking for a hotel to stay for a short amount of time but with a maximum impact when it comes to attentiveness. This hotel ticked all the boxes for us both.   This trip was our Honeymoon (March 11 - March 14) we were married the day before arriving. Even though I'd read many glowing reviews on here prior to arriving I was still continually amazed as was my Wife at the courteous and friendly staff that made our stay here perfect in every way I cannot praise them highly enough.  We arrived by taxi and were ushered into the quaint downstairs lobby and then quickly relieved of all our luggage. We were taken up the five floors in a lovely golden elevator and shown the way through to the Executive Lounge which immediately brought a wow to my lips. Check in was smooth and quick…
March 2012,What a Fantastic Hotel and Staff,"Stayed for two nights and all I can say is the best hotel we have stayed in bar none, as soon as we arrived from the welcoming member of staff in the front lobby, to the fantastic staff greeting you as you arrive at the reception. Every member of Hotel 41 should be congratulated on their first class attention paid to the guests nothing was too much trouble , what ever you need they are on hand to help you..  Upon arrival you greeted with a welcoming smile and two very nice glasses of champagne (not the cheap stuff either )!!!! the room was ready upon arrival-12 midday, and we was told to take our time until we was ready then taken to our room which had the wow factor!! Open fireplace was on and we were made to feel right at home straight away. Loved the idea of the honesty bar…"
March 2012,Amazing refuge,"Just stayed two nights at this wonderful hotel. First visit, and was skeptical given all the glowing reviews -- but Hotel 41 measured up fully. I won't repeat all the points about service levels, other than to say that I've never felt as relaxed and as at home in a hotel anywhere (and I've traveled a lot). The setting is warm and welcoming and you feel the staff is disappointed if you decline their (frequent) offers to help. A very special place."
February 2012,A wonderful birthday experience,"Stayed here for the third time with my husband in an Executive King room. Everything was perfect.   We brought my husband's mother for a significant birthday weekend and both she and my father in law were enchanted with the place.  The standard of rooms, decor, food, drink, service is just that bit further than you will get in the larger 5 star establishments. You really feel like you matter as a guest here.  Special note to Federic the maitre d' who despite his tender years is the perfect host - nothing is too much trouble, politeness incarnate, no detail escapes his notice.  we will (all) return. many thanks"
July 2011,"Service,service,service. All with charm,warthm and a smile.",I admit this was a lash out for a couple of old Aussie duffers. Rather than the usual impersonal large international hotel we chose this most English of properties. It's an Olde Worlde experience in a remarkable 5th floor boutique hotel. The rooms are beautiful each with its own theme..our was a suite with a fireplace and staircase. Great bathroom with bath and shower. Did I say shower....the best in the world! Hot and great pressure. Lucky it was predicted to rain in London because I used half the cities water in this shower. Wow I've never been so clean.  We had a dinner and afternoon tea in our package. The first was in the restaurant downstairs called the Library. We were knackered and didn't feel like eating...till we sat down. What a meal. It was finished by a bowl of…
March 2012,Amazing....Sexy....Romantic...everything you could want!,"We have stayed at this hotel 3 times, the first we stayed in the hospitality suite it is such a stunning room with everything in the hotel being black and white it really works. The suite is huge everything you could possible want or need my only criticism is the size of the bath it is such a shame it is not a bit bigger as this would make it perfect! Everyone is really friendly, glass of champagne on arrival, we had room service on this occasion and it was really nice most hotels fall down on room service but nope can't complain about anything.   The next time we stayed in the conservatory suite erm it's a lovely suite the bathroom is amazing , the bath is perfect would be nice if it was in the hospitality suite. Being able to open up the blind and look up at the stars is very…"
February 2012,I've found my home from home at 41!,"We booked this hotel based on the recommendations on Trip Advisor and it is proof the system really works! From the minute we arrived we were cocooned in the most excellent customer care I have ever experienced, which as a seasoned traveller is saying a lot. Frederic, Remus, Julian and all the other staff made us so welcome and there was nothing that was too much trouble. The rooms, both public and bedrooms, are beautifully presented with dozens of little details for your added comfort. We had two Junior Suites - individual in design but uniformly delightful in style and amenties, and with the most comfortable bed ever! 41 - now that I've found you, you've become my second home in London!"
February 2012,The Best Hotel I Have Ever Stayed At!,"I took my girlfriend (now fiance) to propose to her that evening at the hotel and it was the best choice I have ever made. The hotel staff were by far the sole reason for our total enjoyment. Their attention to detail is something to be desired and the rooms were outstanding. After enjoying a complimentary glass of champagne when checking in, we went to our room and minutes later had a phone call from reception to ask if we want to move to an upgraded room which had become available due to a cancellation. We were upgraded to an executive king which was very spacious and well equiped. I also ordered the romantic turndown and they must have used dozens of roses to scatter petals all over the room, the setting was perfect. This was organised while we were at dinner, and there was…"
February 2012,The Best Kept Secret!,"My husband and I are seasoned travelers, and I am very picky about hotels. Hotel 41 is, by far, my favorite hotel I have stayed in. London's best kept secret is no more! From the moment you walk through the unassuming entrance, a world of elegance, refinement, charm, and exquisite service awaits you. Our two level suite was beautiful with fine linens, contemporary furnishings, an inviting fireplace, two flat screen TVs, and the added touches in the evening of burning candles, tasty chocolates, and bottled water. But it is in the Library where the true pampering awaits. Seated by a crackling fire surrounded by tasteful elegance, the professional staff greet and serve you with a sense of grace and style. Who knew the mere presentation of tea could be made into a true art form?…"
August 2011,"Wonderful location, professional and friendly staff","My husband I were celebrating our 10th Wedding Anniversary and wanted guaranteed 5 star accomodation and service. We were not dissapointed. We were warmly welcomed from the moment we stepped inside this lovely hotel. Every single member of staff was friendly, polite and professional lead by Magda and Freddie. When I had realised that I had forgotten my inner soles for my shoes for the evening, one member of staff went out and got them for me! I couldn't believe it.  Breakfast was amazing. The hotel is small but stunning and situated yards from Buckingham Palace and a 5 min walk to the tube station. We would definetly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting luxury and 5 star service. We will go back with our little girl next time. Thank you Hotel 41 for a truly lovely stay."
January 2012,I can only echo the words of others here,"""simply the best"". 10/10; 5 *; 100%.  This must be as close to heaven as you can get on earth."
February 2012,"""Simply the Best""","I took my girlfriend here for a surprise for her birthday back in January. I have been very fortunate to travel around the world and stayed in quite a few wonderful hotels BUT Hotel 41 is SIMPLY the BEST hotel I have ever stayed in by far!  From the moment I made the reservation and informed the hotel that I was bringing my g/f here for her birthday as a surprise I was given so many ideas/options to make her day even more special.  I was provided with a form prior to arrival so that Hotel 41 could accommodate any special requests. The form included information such as pillow menu, if we required any particular magazines, music etc.   Once we arrived at Hotel 41 we were greeted to by a very warm welcome by the doorman, that escorted us to reception. We were offered a glass of…"
February 2012,Best hotel reception ever,"This is the best hotel staffs I have ever experienced!   Excellent service, wonderful attention and with heart and sincerity. I have been travelling for more than 15 years and never wrote a feedback, be it good or bad, though I had more than fair share of bad experience and at times, was really tempted to write to complain.   However, my stay at Hotel 41 was so great that it prompted me, for the first time, to write in and compliment them. In addition to the great hotel staffs, who among many things, were helpful, offered me a boardroom for my breakfast meeting, good dessert plate in my room, brought me a set of tea after check-in. The room is exquisite and location good.   This is more than boutique, it's a one with class and service. Now I understand why it's the smallest (28…"
December 2011,London Luxury,"I have stayed at ""41"" on average one week a month for the past year.  The hotel is my ""home away from home"" as I travel from the US to Europe quite often for business. The rooms are wonderful, but it's the staff that make my stays remarkable!  I can't think of anywhere else I'd rather stay when in London!"
February 2012,Heaven,"If heaven was a hotel it would be Hotel 41. You 'go to the light' through a beautiful but low key front door. Whereupon you are greeted buy a very pleasant man who shows you the way. Which of course is through some golden gates, you then ascend on high in a golden elevator. At reception you are welcomed by a few angelic members of staff. Who's only job is make sure you stay there is 'heavenly'. Which is helped with a glass of bubbles.  But seriously. This hotel is amazing. No request is to big or to small. The atmosphere is one of grand opulence and also a romantic hideaway. It has many reasons to be the best hotel you've ever stayed in, but for me the main reason is the staff. They are very professional and yet remain the most friendly people. The turn down service is the most…"
February 2012,A truly praiseworthy boutique hotel of exceptional standard,"My wife and I spent 3 days here during mid-February 2012, and found it every bit as good as the many positive reviews had led us to believe. What differentiates 5-star hotels is not so much their infrastructure, but rather their staff, and that of the ""41"" is quite simply exceptional. We are used to good service but rarely in 40 years of extensive travelling have we met staff of the standard of the ""41"": personable, welcoming, impeccable, polyglot, immensely helpful, and genuinely friendly, they made our stay a real joy. The crisp linens, warm duvets, heavy robes and (somewhat recalcitrant but nevertheless cheerful) gas fire also turned our spacious room into a welcome haven from the unexpectedly cold London February weather, as did the well-appointed lounge with its gentlemen's…"
February 2012,"Romantic, eclectic, boutique   hideaway, in central location","This is a very special boutique hotel.  The service is cheerful and attentive and was the perfect 20th anniversary treat for my husband and I.  Our stay was made all the more delightful due to the fact that the hotel became a sanctuary away from a heavy snowfall.  London had come to a standstill so after trudging past some familiar London landmarks in the snow, it was wonderful to access the delights of the executive lounge and snuggle by the open fire.  An added surprise was the fabulous romantic turndown, with rose petals scattered in the bedroom and bathroom and floating candles.  The anniversary cake, which had not been prearranged, but very welcomed, topped our evening.  The breakfast was equally tasty and professionally presented and cooked.  Would definitely recommend…"
February 2012,What a Gem!,"From the moment I set food in the classic entrance of the 41 Hotel, I was met with friendly smiles, great conversation, top class service and a lovely (and LARGE) flute of clear champagne. I have nothing but good words for this hotel and I highly recommend it to everyone. The hotel boats gorgeous classic english decor complete with mahogany oak, black and white checks and luxurious leather couches. The rooms are beautiful, spacious and luxurious. The executive lounge has a lovely private gentleman's club feel that I enjoyed immensely. My highest praise goes to the wonderful set of staff they have at this hotel. They were genuinely interested in their guests which is rare to see in hotels nowadays. Mr. Frederic Dallot in particular was fabulously witty and interesting.   When you…"
January 2012,Impeccable: perfect in every way!,"From start to finish, our experience in Hotel 41 was exceptional.  As others have, justifiably, commented the staff are brilliant.  Nothing is too much trouble and they look after their guests immaculately.  The reception staff are geuinely interested in their guests and were excellent.    The lounge is lovely, well appointed and pristinely clean.  We enjoyed a gorgeus afternoon tea there and then in the evening a crisp glass of chablis accompanied by delicious canapes.  We did indeed ""plunder the pantry"" one evening, also delicious and served with grace by an ever helpful staff member.  Our room lived up to expectations and I am fussy about certain features such as the quality of the bed, little touches of luxury and the bathroom products.  On all counts, Hotel 41 was perfect. …"
February 2012,"""First Class""","We stayed for three nights in January and had a first class experience from start to finish.  The entire staff were the perfect combination of professional and personable at the same time.  We truly enjoyed our afternoon tea after a long day, with Michael being our server.  The room was comfortable and well appointed.  Thank you Freddie and Monika for a wonderful stay!  We look forward to our return in December."
January 2012,Simply Fabulous,"The world is a much better place for having Hotel 41 in it. I wish for everyone that they had a chance to experience it. It really is a treasure. Hotel 41 in London is a  real gem so if you get a chance, spoil yourself and experience Hotel 41.  This hotel is everything other reviewers have said in their reviews that convinced me to book it for my time in London.  I wondered if my expectations might be too high due to such rave reviews, but I was not disappointed (and I can be picky).  It's very professional but homely at the same time. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff, any of the staff at any time....they are all equally helpful and lovely.   My son and I shared an 'executive room' with twin beds', room 4106. I understand all the rooms are all unique in some way. The…"
September 2011,Excellent Hotel,"I stayed at Hotel 41 in late January 2012 on the recommendation of my travel agent.  The staff were incredibly helpful (getting direction, hailing cabs, storing luggage,etc.), the room was very comfortable (comfy bed and the bathroom had a shower and a tub in it).  The executive lounge offers an elegant and quiet spot to relax at the end of the day, grab a snack, read a bit and have a drink.  Room service was also very good.  The location is superb, right next to Buckingham Palace and a 10-minute walk to Westminister Abbey.  Close to Mayfair with great shopping and, if you're in the business, lots of hedge fund offices.  I'll definitely stay here again."
July 2011,Very romantic,"We came here for business/romantic trip. We loved this hotel. Staff was very accommodating. They sent us to a great breakfast place around the corner and also arranged a private car for our return to the airport. My husband was working so I checked in alone and I was very early, so they took our bags and I went exploring the area. When I came back everything was ready. Room wasn't big but we enjoyed the cozy feel to it. We had after dinner drinks sent to our room at night which was very romantic. The location is also a plus. Bucking ham palace is barely a block away and the gardens were beautiful to take a nap or people watch."
December 2011,I do get the hype of this hotel.,This is a very personal Hotel with great service.  We felt as though we were a guest not just another number.  When you enter the reception/lounge area it feels like you have entered a different world.  The location is brilliant right next to Buckingham Palace.  It took the stress out of a London visit as we could walk to many places such as Westminster.    You can pay a lot less for hotels in London but id recommend Hotel 41 as its a different experience. Couldnt fault it.
January 2012,DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE,"Stayed four wonderful nights at Hotel 41 in December 2011.  My wife and daughter felt like British Royalty here.  The staff (especially Magdalena and Frederick) went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and welcome.  Probably the best service of any hotel we have stayed at in the world.  Far superior than some of the Peninsula, Waldorf or other Five Star Hotels we have been blessed to enjoy.  I booked the room based on reviews from Tripadvisor.  The price was very high and we thought that there would be no way any hotel is worth this kind of money. We were wrong.  Hotel 41 is worth the price.  Every employee knows your name here.  Every employee addresses you when they see you.  Every employee asks if your require any assistance.  From making restaurant reservations to…"
December 2011,Who are these moaners?,"You really have to go out your way to find something to criticise about this hotel!! I have stayed in bigger hotels, with bigger rooms, with better views...... But to be frank, having regard to the standard of service that you get here, it matters not what the view is. I would not have cared if the view had been of Baghdad after a bad night. It would still get the five stars.  The room was small.... We did not complain, but on day 2 one of the staff came up and said that if we would like to move to a larger room he would arrange that. The one we were in was perfectly adequate and we did not move. They have thought of everything in terms of comfort - even in the desk they had paper clips, stapler, scissors, and all kinds of little bits and bobs you just might need. Free wifi!!…"
October 2011,Doesn't get better than this,"My husband and I recently stayed at 41 to ring in the New Year in London, following a jaunt to Amsterdam and Paris for a 2-week vacation. I can't think of a better way to kick off our travels. We originally chose 41 after seeing the overwhelmingly positive TripAdvisor reviews, but I must admit I was a little skeptical of the high praise. However, I am happy to report that 41 met - nay, exceeded - all of our wildest expectations. This review is on the long side, but I thought it important to share some specific details and high points:  The Greeting: Our flight arrived at 7 a.m. London time, and even though check-in isn't until afternoon, we went to the hotel to drop off our bags. Upon arriving, the friendly staff greeted us by name and offered us a beverage while we checked in.…"
December 2011,First stop on our European Honeymoon! Worth every cent!,"We started off with 4 nights in one of my favorite cities LONDON. We stayed at the amazing luxury 5 star boutique hotel 41. It was amazing! Top notch service! We did the open top double decker bus to get to the usual tourist attractions and walked the city, we loved every second of it, from pubs to shopping to a day trip to Stonehenge we were enchanted by the city of London."
December 2011,Can't get the hype,We booked this place in December 2011 for our London Trip as it was 2011 Traveller's Choice winner. My partner and me have been in many luxury hotels all over the world but our expectations were greatly disappointed with this one. We booked a split-level junior suite and the suite is done in a way that they made two levels out of one from an old building. Thust the higher level with sleeping area and bathroom is just about 180 to 185 cm high. For me being 195cm tall this was just awful as I couldn't even stand straight and you get some claustrophobic feeling after some time. Considering that this suite costs a total off nearlly the 1000 GBP this is just ridiculous. Breakfast was not overhelming as well.  Otherwise the hotel is made to be very british and located very nice for…
January 2012,Best hotel in London,"This is the hotel equivalent of 'The Fat Duck' restaurant. Service is second to none, and not in your face or over the top. We also got upgraded to the most amazing room. If you stay in this hotel, don't book to do anything else, as it is an experience of it's own."
May 2011,wonderful experience,"I arrived in London for two days business and was treated like royalty, the staff were second to none, friendly, helpful and caring. You get the feeling of being transported into another world. Loved the loyalty book, brings back the feeling of trust and respect, something which is now so hard to find anywhere. Will definately recommend and hopefully return to at another time in the future."
December 2011,The safest Hotel in London,"I stayed at Hotel 41 and had the experience of a lifetime. Your every desire is taken care of and the atmosphere is second to none. Located across the street from Buckingham Palace was a plus as I was in London a few days After the Royal Wedding, 2011.  You feel safe and pampered and I will return this year. The staff, Antoinette, Monika, PJ, and wonderful Magdalena were AWESOME!!!! They found me a program from the wedding, and trust me, this was hard to find. Thank you all for the top-notch service."
October 2011,Extremely Romantic Experience!,"We stayed here for one night for a special occasion and wished we could have stayed longer! The service was excellent, the staff were very helpful, we were upgraded and the food was very good with a wide selection for breakfast. We recommend the afternoon tea which was very filling. We had booked the romantic turndown as a surprise which was lovely. Our stay was very peaceful and romantic- just what we were after. In fact we liked it so much we are planning our honeymoon here for next year- Frederic spent time showing us the different rooms so we could see what else was on offer for that. Wonderful hotel that definately deserves its reputation on here."
December 2011,A Truly Special Place,"I can hardly do justice writing about our great experience.  I chose this hotel because of it location, boutique-feel and its outstanding Trip Advisory rating.  I took my son to London to see our beloved Chicago Bears play in Wembley for his 7th birthday.  I was bit worried upon arrival that the hotel was too intimate for a child and our presence might alarm the mainly adult guests who paid handsomely to be away from children.  My worry was wasted as the staff was so incredible with my son, Luke.  Perhaps most impressive was the staffs versatility; they could cater to the whim of an opera going adult couple and then effortlessly shift gears to cater to the much different whims of a 7-year old boy.  Bravo.  The hotel itself is a oasis from the hustle and bustle of touring London.…"
December 2011,Very Nice Hotel,"Stayed here for a night recently and it was very nice. The staff was extremely attentive, helpful, and friendly. The room was very comfortable and well prepared. Location is great as it is very close to Victoria Station which makes it very easy to get around. The only word of caution I would give is that the hot water in the sink and shower is immediately very hot which led to me slightly burning my hands the first time I went to the restroom. It wasn't a problem once I knew it was coming though. Overall I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a very nice hotel in a great area with a very helpful staff."
December 2011,"Hotel 41 London, what a treat!","Having been in the travel industry for many years and been lucky enough to visit some very beautiful hotels, none were as welcoming and hospitable as those at Hotel 41.  An absolute treasure tucked away in a quiet location with great shops and restaurants.  I hope to return with my partner as soon as possible.  Well done to all the staff...."
December 2011,the 41 for ever...,"The best 5 nights ever spent in a hotel. The staff of this hotel, without any exception, give you the best service ever.You are looked after like nowhere else. Their input and commitment are guaranteed to make your stay a success. The hotel decoration is tasteful and pleasant. The location is perfect and as the hotel only has abt. 28 rooms the service has a much more personal approach.Here you are not a number but a guest. As I said to the staff upon getting back at the hotel every day...""it's good to be back home""...because that is how it felt. Here you get more for the money. Centrally located, quiet, and safe as the hotel is located on the 5th floor.  This hotel has an amazing team working together well. No need to look further..if London is the palce to be, then the 41 is…"
December 2011,Totally exceeded our expectations (which were already pretty high!),"We stayed at 41 for our honeymoon and it is a wonderful, special, treat of a place that we will re-visit in the future for our 'special' weekends away. Freddie and his team were brilliant.  A perfect mix of super attentive yet friendly and fun with it. My fiance, now husband had booked it as a secret and I was blown away. The breakfasts were fabulous, my favourite being the eggs royal.  Oh yum yum yum!  Then the Plunder the Pantry at night was a feast in itself. Candles and Rose petals all over the room too.  I just cant speak highly enough about it. We had seen the few bad reviews and can only imagine they were either masd, blind, or in the wrong place!! The worse I can say is the bed was very soft but hey, thats merely my preference, not something wrong with the place.…"
December 2011,Tranquility  in chaos,"Just returned from a 3 day trip. The whole experience was incredible. The team, surroundings, service and professionalism was superb. If you are looking for a very tranquil setting in the heart of busy London, then this is the place."
December 2011,The best we ever had!,"We have been in lots of hotels, also in London, but this was the best we ever had. The decoration of the rooms and the lounge is sophisticated and pleasant. As soon as you walk in, the staff gives you a warm welcome and not only because they have to. You really feel like coming home. They take care of you and they assist you in word and deed, giving you advice about the musea, shops, restaurants etc. Well, we can only speak in superlatives about this hidden secret near Buckingham Palace. We loved every minute of our stay. Surely we 'll go back there next time.  Hans and Alicia Winters, The Netherlands."
December 2011,A Tranquil Oasis,"What a lovely place to stay! As a Londoner, I have seen so many glitzy 5 star hotels. Thankfully, those who want glitz don't come here: Hotel 41 has none of the stuff and nonsense of most of the competition. From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave, you will be aware (but only vaguely) of the amazing personal, professional service with so much attention to detail - like a swan moving on water, all their work is unseen. The relaxed but stylish surroundings, typified by the hotel lounge, is so stylish and restful; a real home from home, if only home were this good!  Mike & Susie."
February 2012,Outstanding and a hotel experience I doubt that will ever be matched!!!,"This hotel is absolutely perfect! Having stayed in London on many occasions and in various 5 star hotels and spa resorts the world over, I have never had an experience or level of service like it! Attention to detail, luxury and the most attentive and friendly staff are but part of the beauty of this hotel. The exquisite and chic decor is outstanding, yet homely and inviting at the same time.  Arriving for a birthday weekend treat, we were immediately greeted by the friendly concierge who offered us a lovely hot coffee while waiting for the manager to whisk us up to the 5th floor paradise. While checking in, we were then asked if we would like a complementary champagne as the staff asked with real interest about our plans for the weekend. At that point we were told if we needed…"
February 2012,This is how a 'real' 5 star hotel should behave!,"41 Hotel at Buckingham Palace Road, London is just superb. This is how a 5 star hotel should behave. Warm and sincere welcome and service is second to none. Private hotel but it feels like coming home. Rooms fully equipped, even with Continental European sockets!  Ever heard a 5 star hotel offering you instantly a coffee or tea with your wake up call?? It's like you have your own butler. Breakfast delicious and again with top service and smile (!). Although on a very busy business trip in London, I never felt more refreshed the following morning. Highly recommended! Great to learn that Superb service and luxury really still exists!"
February 2012,The jewel in the crown,Situated just behind Buckingham Palace this compact bespoke hotel cannot be beaten.  The staff are friendly and helpful. Nothing is to much trouble.  Your receive a wonderful welcome from you arrive until you leave.  I recommend it to anyone staying in London as you will NEVER be disappointed.
February 2012,Fantastic Experience,"We had asked before arriving at Hotel 41 if we could have a early check-in. Our room was ready by 11am which was great. The staff were very welcoming as soon as we stepped into the hotel. We were shown around the 'Executive Suite' and told that Breakfast, Snacks,and 'Plunder The Pantry' was served there at no extra cost ( except for drinks ). Every member of staff were very efficient, smiling, nothing was too much trouble for them especially the resident manager. Our room was very clean and fresh. Very comfortable bed and pillows, even a pillow menus was available. The bathroom was spotless, I enjoyed taking a bath while watching the TV on the wall in the bathroom! If we are lucky enough to stay in London again, my first choice of hotel would be Hotel 41 as this was an…"
February 2012,41 trip,"Outstanding hotel.  the Trip Advisor rating for theis Hotel is SPOT ON   The experience from beginning to end was amazing (even though we incorrectly arrived at the Rubens next door, we were immediately ushered through the ""secret door"" to 41, making you feel like very important guests!) .  Monika and her team seem to have it running perfectly and make you feel like they really do appreciate your business.  As our waitress said in the lounge “you’ll never go hungry in this hotel”.  The complimentary side is fantastic, service spot on and on time with breakfast in our room which was very tasty.  I hope to be back here on a very regular basis.  We have always rated the Red Carnation Group of hotels and previously favoured the Chesterfield in the West End BUT we will now go to the…"
January 2012,Awesome Experience,"I stayed here for several days while on business in London. The hotel is immaculate and the staff are extremely helpful and courteous. The atmosphere was genuine and not stuffy. The day I was leaving, London was dealing with a major snowstorm to them and the airport was canceling flights etc. I was on my way to Paris on the Eurostar and they spent time calling to verify the trains were going to run and even called a cab to come and pick me up. They also offered to allow me to stay and would even take care of getting new tickets for the Eurostar for the next day if needed. I love the place. The food was excellent , the staff were all excellent. They really do go out of their way to make you feel at home. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to be pampered.."
February 2012,Fabulous service and lovely oasis in great location!,We recently returned from a 3 night stay at Hotel 41.  The service was exceptional. The rooms were beautifully appointed. The highlight was the lounge which was a quiet and clubby respite from the bustle of the city. Freddie and his staff are world class.
August 2011,Perfection,We had a fantastic 2 nights at hotel 41. The staff are very friendly and helpful and made everything very easy for us.
January 2012,Elegance,"The perfect hotel that is well maintained. Good services. The staff very friendly. If you want luxury and confort, you can stay there. Highly recommended."
January 2012,60th Birthday Celebration,"My son and I have just returned from a three night stay at the 41, celebrating my 60th birthday and I can't praise the hotel highly enough. It was wonderful in every way (apart from the television which was rather small and old) from its perfect central location near Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station, the comfort and warmth of its rooms with so many extra personal touches (there was a delicious birthday cake waiting for me on arrival) and, last but not least, the staff. The service is outstanding, very friendly but courteous and extremely personal. Nothing is too much trouble and they always asked after our day when we returned to the hotel. Everyone helped to make our stay and my birthday celebration so very special."
January 2012,Weekend away with daughter for my 60th birthday.,"Fabulous Hotel,lovely staff,felt very safe in a wonderful setting.Buckingham Palace just over the road.Hospitality was second to none.Had the breakfast and the afternoon tea,both were excellant.Stayed in many London Hotels,because my daughter lives there,and I  visit three or four times a year,so we stay in different Hotels,its like a little holiday each visit.This was the best ever,The room was beautiful,many little touchs,chocs,candles,olives,lovely dressing gowns and slippers,the fire was light when we returned from an evening in the lounge and a little trip in the night air.It was a little expensive,but hey what price a lovely memory,you can't put a price on that.Would love to re visit,maybe at Xmas,Thanks again to all the lovely staff,for a lovely Birthday,still eating the…"
August 2011,A Return,"We had visited Hotel 41 before and felt a certain trepidation about returning and spoiling what is a wonderful memory. If anything our second stay was even better. The consistently excellent service, the fine balance between precision, professionalism and warmth, the serice and care make this hotel one of the world's finest."
January 2012,"Not up to the rating, we barely managed to get our bags in the room","We were due to stay here for 2 nights as part of our honeymoon before jetting off to america for 6 weeks, we had 4 large bags and after we put them in the room there was not much space to swing a cat.  The hotel executive lounge is nice but to be honest its a strange setup where its part of Rubens hotel.  To be honest we stayed 1 night at a cost of £300 then checked into an executive room at the cavendish for half that price and the room was twice the size.  There are far better hotels out there and its a shame its ranked no 1 as it is very misleading and we were caught out by this."
December 2011,5 Star .....and more !!,"The whole experience from start to finish was amazing ! From dealing with Jasmeet to confirm the booking, to being checked in (and out) by Magdalena - the service was first class. The staff treat you like royalty but manage to do this without making you feel uncomfortable. They will help out with anything from booking theatre tickets to even packing your luggage when you leaving if you want.   I booked the stay as a treat for my wife's birthday (They provided a complimentary birthday cake for my wife). Upon arrival we were escorted up stairs to check in and given a complimentary glass of champagne. Each staff member we encountered wished her happy birthday, asked how the room was and if there was anything they could do for us. The room was amazing, a really good size, decorated…"
December 2011,The best hotel in London*,"*in our opinion anyway!  My husband booked Hotel 41 for a romantic weekend away in December.  He regularly stays in London and has stayed at some of the best, but for him, Hotel 41 gives a truly personal experience, something the larger hotels are unable to provide.  Nothing is too much trouble for Frederic and his team.  Adam personally arranged fantastic seats for us at 'Wicked' and because the hotel has such a lovely feel about it, we decided to eat there rather than going out before the show.  The food was excellent and in the morning you could easily spend a couple of hours enjoying breakfast.  'Plunder the pantry' was perfectly timed when we returned after the show and the 'turndown' was something I have never experienced before.  It seemed like every time we left our room…"
December 2011,A gem of a hotel!,"What's not to love about 41? My partner and I stayed there for two nights from new years eve 2011 and were amazed, neither of us thought you could get such good service. The staff were first rate - polite, sensitive to our needs (and moods!), well informed about London and the local area, extremely helpful and were constantly looking for ways to make our stay perfect. The hotel itself was clean and well kept with beautiful furnishings, furniture and fittings. the rooms were perfect - lovely bathrooms, comfy beds, latest tech in TV's and CD player/radio, splash proof TV in the bathroom! Features wise, whilst we didn't really use a huge number of the amenities we were kept abreast of all they could offer - local gym, pool, spa and so on and everything seemed to be to a very high…"
December 2011,Excellent Boutique Hotel,I stayed at 41 in December and we had an excellent experience.  It was my Dad's 70th birthday and the hotel staff and the beautiful surroundings made it a very special experience for us.  The balance of 5 star professioanlism and informality amongst the staff makes the hotel feel special without it being formal or stuffy. I am staying there again soon and look forward very much to our stay.  Thank you to Remus and all the staff.
December 2011,Great trip during the holidays,"The staff at Hotel 41 are not only extremely helpful and service-oriented.  This much one would certainly expect from a five-star hotel.  But the staff also exude warmth, rather than formality, and they show great skill at learning the interests of the guests.    Typically, my wife and I can be made to feel uncomfortable by high-level service.  We don't want anyone to think that we believe we are any better than anyone else, and often ""five-star"" service creates an ambience that screams, ""You're SUPPOSED to act like you're better than the have-nots!""    Not so at Hotel 41.  From the moment we walked in the door and were greeted by Roman, the staff made us feel at home.  Thanks need to go out to Roman, Julian (great recommendation/reservation for lunch at Quilon!), and the great…"
December 2011,Thanks for a Brilliant Weekend,"Family wanted to stay in London over New Years.   We booked 4 days at Hotel 41 - 2 rooms, so we had a connecting room for the kids.   We really didnt know much about the hotel other than the great write-ups from Trip Advisor.  The write-ups don't do justice to the Hotel.  It was nothing short of amazing.  The staff beats any high end hotel chain (think Four Seasons) with their service and personality.  They knew the kids by name and helped with any request (dinner reservations, tickets to plays, etc).   Would highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting London."
December 2011,Still a brilliant small hotel with exceptional service,"We have just spent the week prior to Christmas at this terrific hotel; just over 4 years since we first stayed here. We were very pleased to find that the exceptional standards we found last time have been maintained. We took an Executive KIng Room which was an excellent size, particularly for London. There is not a lot of point in covering off the points that set this hotel apart from other luxury hotels; they are covered off adequately by many other recent trip advisor reviews.... except to reiterate that the staff are what make the difference, they are simply the best we have found in any hotel anywhere.  We thoroughly recommend ""41"" to anybody wanting a truely exceptional hotel experience without the ""machine"" like feel that you can get from larger establishments."
November 2011,Alchemy has a number...41,"Alchemy's a rare commodity ... but '41' has it.  Hard to define how/why a boutique hotel is quite so outstanding ; exceptional staff  + understated luxury + outstanding attention to detail and quality +  beautiful difference + elegant charm + royal location...all there plus ..honestly...a tiny bit of magic*  We spent a perfect 3 night stay there in December. The chaos of our journey melted within seconds of arriving : the ultimate in discrete effiiciency (Frederick...manager), had conjured a perfect split-level suite, open-fire, candle light, relaxing drinks. Everything happened magically, effortlessly...doors opened, ice-bucket waiting,restaurant tables arranged.

September 2011,Wonderful Experience,"Our family alway consults Trip Advisor before reserving hotel accommodations.  The reviews of this hotel were ALL positive; especially about the staff.  My father served in the 8th Air Corp during WWII; so one of the reasons for my trip to London was to visit WWII memorials to the ""Mighty Eighth.""  The hotel concierge (Julian) was so helpful in this regard (finding the addresses, printing out directions and what tube/trains to take).  I stayed at the hotel for 10 days and was treated royally.  The king-bed room was clean and very comfortable.  The location is excellent...block from Buckingham Palace and St. James Park; down the Pall Mall to the Nat'l Gallery etc, etc.  But it is the hotel staff that makes 41 such a great place to stay.  I will return soon"
October 2011,Wonderful,"Stunning hotel, superb staff, great location.  Perfect!"
November 2011,Wow - what an experience,I was lucky to stay here thanks to a gift from my former employer and what an experience.  I can not fault ANYTHING about this hotel.  From the service of the staff to the quality of the hotel room nothing can be faulted.    I will definitely be returning again.
November 2011,a private club,"This establishment is more like a private club with rooms than a hotel. After the initial confusion of trying to check in at the Rubens, a plump boutique hotel with a more public face on Buckingham Palace Road, I was led next door to the less obvious entrance - street number 41 obviously - which amounts to a small foyer with a concierge and a lift with a single button, for level 5.  Out the lift and around a few corners of the snug corridor that zig zags around the floor brings you to the ""executive lounge"", a plush double-volume internal room stuffed with furniture, fireplace and a mahogany desk in the corner for checking in and out, and from where a watchful duty manager keeps an eye on guests taking breakfast, tea or drinks in the evening.  This is pretty much the heart of…"
November 2011,Best decision I ever made,"I picked this hotel based on reading reviews from trip advisor. I couldn't be happier. Room, staff, food and facilities were excellent. My room 4102 was spacious and dead quiet  i was able to walk to Kensington, leicester, oxford, regent, picadilly and westminster. I didn't need to lift a finger. The staff took care of everything including theatre tickets. The hotel is rigt outside where the horses and carriages leave from buckingham palace. There was a state visit going on my last day and It was exciting watching everything take place. I struggled between 41 and the other top rated hotel. I made the right choice staying at 41. All the staff were great  Highly recommended. "
November 2011,the best service ever,unique hotel. The best service i had experienced ever. (and i have a handfull hotels in my belt)
November 2011,Superlative Hotel,"Exceptional 5 star service. I won't repeat the accolades that others have showered, but I assure you they are all well-deserved. I will surely be returning very soon!"
November 2011,No 1 for a reason,"When you see somewhere thats got such good reviews its difficult to ignore. In the case of Hotel 41 this is easy to see why. From the moment we arrived till we left we were made to feel very special. The Hotel itself is a boutique hotel, part of the Red carnation group, who's sister hotels we have also stayed in.  This was the best by some way. The hotel is located in Buckingham Palace road, 5 minute walk from the Palace and 5 mins to Victoria tube. From there its 15 mins to Harrods or Oxford st for shopping - so great location. When inside its like an Oasis of calm. A lovely drawing room and bar full of character. Again all the staff were great and attentive when required and discreet too. We had the afternnon tea which was really tasty and great quality and the service was…"
November 2011,Hotel 41,"Stayed at Hotel 41 for the first time last week. I must tell you, I have been to many hotels around the world and this is up with the best of them. Every part of the stay was fantastic, faultless service, clean rooms., great location etc  Would definitely recommend this hotel when staying in London and will be staying there again."
December 2011,Best kept secret in London,"I was curious to know what the fuss was all about at Hotel 41. A 5* hotel in London I never heard off? Worth a try. Boy, was I in for a great surprise! The hotel is opposite the Palace mews adjacent to the Rubens hotel. You need to know this because cab drivers do not know, which in itself is a surprise, black cabbies with the ""knowledge"" who do not know this 5* hotel?   This is part of the allure of ""41"". You feel you are entering into a private member's club and this is how they make you feel from the minute you open the rather unassuming street door. A small entrance clad in marble and oak takes you to a single golden elevator that takes you directly to the 5th floor. Only 28 rooms or so and hence the exclusivity of this place. I feel like I am giving away a secret (despite…"
December 2011,A perfect new year,"I made a last minute booking for a surprise trip for a new year gift ,what a gift ,if you want to stay in a hotel in London and want places in walking distance  then this is the place ,they could not do enough for you ,highly recommend the the Full English breakfast, its one to keep you going all day , Staff were great and helpful so thank you to them ,Hotel 41 has every thing for your stay.would definitely stay again ,"
December 2011,Excellent hotel,"Exceptionaland luxurious hotel. You will be amazed of the detailed and excellent service you will get.Nice location, near the Buckingham palace on foot. Nice fireplace."
December 2011,A perfect Christmas stay in London,"My wife and I decided to spend our Christmas in London.  The reviews for ""41"" were spot on.  We signed up for the Christmas package which also included Christmas stockings and afternoon tea, which were both exceptional.  The room was classically British with a modern twist (not at all stuffy).  I liked the wireless Internet, Bose player for my iPhone, and the surround sound system in the room.  The fireplace added a cozy, romantic feel that was so welcoming after a day of sightseeing or a night at the theater. The staff was attentive, polite, and quickly knew our names and personal needs.  The breakfast was superb and filling.  Can't wait to go back! Who's going to turn down my bed tonight?!"
November 2011,Perfect little birthday treat!,"i cannot recommend this hotel enough! the rooms are small but very elegant, they were spotless and full of little luxury items to make sure your stay is nothing but perfect. i requested a ""romantic turn down"" as it was my wife's birthday and i was not dissapointed, very nice touch's were made to our room and i can 100% recommend this to all you fella's out there!  my last comment will be the staff, they were amazing! extremely friendly without being over the top and they actually made our stay and will definitely be the reason that we stay again in the future, they even gave us a bath robe for our 1 year old son who wasn't even with us!  just nice personal touch's that made our stay absolutely perfect!  so a huge thank you to the staff of hotel 41."
October 2011,Love the personal touches.,"A hotel with a difference....cozy, stylish and exceptional staff.  Rooms are small in keeping with London standards but packed with luxury and nice finishing touches.  The room turndown meant we were greeted with a warm welcoming room at the end of the day.  Location just behind Buckingham Palace, and up the road from Victoria Station is just great Expensive YES... But good value when compared to other lux central London hotels."
October 2011,amazing hospitality and luxury,"I stayed here for one night to celebrate an anniversary - when I travel, I tend to spend a pretty  penny for someplace nice for one night, and I would suggest this place to anyone. Completely separate from the Rubens hotel right next door/downstairs (also a Red Carnation property), Hotel 41 is directly across the street from Buckingham Palace. After checking in, we were guided upstairs and informed of the nightly happy hour they held in their private lounge, a beautiful space on the top floor of the building (same floor as our room) with clerestory windows up top and beautiful books everywhere. This is the same space where breakfast was served in the morning.   We stopped by the lounge to chat with the concierge about dinner plans, since it was our anniversary, and they…"
November 2011,A real find.,"Stayed for one night with my wife before flying out to the USA and this was the first night of our special 30th wedding anniversary celebratory trip. We have stayed at a number of the Red Carnation Collection Hotels and this is one of the best. Located in Buckingham Palace road next door to Reubens hotel it is about a twenty minute walk to Picadilly Circus and theatreland.  The Hotel is quiet, clean and extremely comfortable and the staff are just superb. Extremely professional and helpful even assisting us with our internet flight check in. Our room (4121) was beautifully appointed and comfortable and the only minor criticism is that the bathroom was a bit small. Nevertheless you could not ask for a higher standard of furnishing and decor.  Arrival and departure were smooth and…"
December 2011,Incredible luxury boutique hotel!!!!!!!,What more can be said about this hotel then has already been added by Tripadvisor members?!?! We searched for a hotel to stay in for one night (the first of our honeymoon!) before travelling on - we wanted somewhere special that would reflect the occasion and considered a wide range of hotels in the London area. In the end there could be only one - Hotel 41!! This is an amazing hotel where service and standards are taken beyong the 5 star level that is too often banded around to mediocre hotels!! The staff cannot do enough for you in the nicest possible way and made our stay forever memorable! The pictures on the website speal for themselves! I would finish by adding - don't think - just book - it is well worth it!!!!!
December 2011,Purcells,We stayed at this wonderful location on return to London after 11 years. It could not have been more enjoyable. The hotel is perfectly located just behind Buckingham Palace and near to Victoria Station. It is beautifully presented. The staff could not be more welcoming and hospitable. Our compliments to Frederic and Adam and all the staff who were most helpful during our stay. We will return.
October 2011,Long Weekend,"Had the best long weeking in London ever. Stayd here from thursday to sunday and the staff here is amazing.  They get everything you need and mutch more. Will defenitly stay here next time we are in London. Great location, near everything you need in London. Luxary all the way. Thanks for the stay 41"
November 2011,Wonderful!,"We loved our stay at 41 Hotel in London. The team was exceptionally attentive, very helpful and had a kind, generous spirit.   Free internet/computer usage was a plus. They also provided ipads to guests who wanted to use them in the privacy of their room. Breakfast was wonderful with a full menu as well as a continental choice.   Service was exceptional.  The hotel felt more like a private club than a hotel.   We stayed for four nights and then returned a few nights later for one additional night before our flight home.  When we returned,  a beautiful bottle of wine, cheese platter and a huge piece of cheesecake with a welcome message was in our room.  The rooms are very comfortable with luxurious sheets, towels and robes.  The best part was that our room was very quiet. A huge…"
December 2011,Excellent service without being stuffy,"My husband chose this hotel because of its high TripAdvisor ranking, and we were not disappointed. We typically would not stay at a top-of-the-list (nor top-of-the-price-range) hotel but we booked this last-minute with the intention of spoiling ourselves a bit. Mission? Accomplished. The staff at Hotel 41 - especially Frederic, Monica, and Remus - literally tripped over themselves to make sure we were taken care of. Everything about the service here was extraordinary and well worth the price. At tea one afternoon, my husband asked if they had chocolate tea, and they regretted they did not. No less than ten minutes later, however, they appeared with chocolate tea, for which they had sent someone down the road to purchase! They booked us amazing seats at two great shows and…"
November 2011,Excellent Service,"The hotel is not the easiest to arrive at if your driving but we drove into the lane behind it and a porter parked our car for us offsite.   We were taken to the executive lounge and made to feel very welcome with complimentary champagne, tea , etc.    Our room was small but packed with everything you might need.  The bed was very comfortable.  Service is the trademark of the hotel and all of the staff work hard to make you feel at home.    Breakfast at £25 was a bit more than I would have expected to pay.  Great hotel in terms of location, brilliant service!  "
December 2011,Fantastic,"I booked this as a present for my fiancé, after checking the reviews from trip advisor. I am so glad I did. From the moment we arrived we felt so welcomed, so relaxed and made to feel special. We were greeted at the door and helped with all our baggage and pushchair, and taken to the executive lounge. All our luggage was taken care of, and there was lots of it due to baby necessities. We had come to london to visit some friends, and they were welcomed in too, given access to the executive lounge, refreshments and nibbles. At all times you were just made to feel special.  Our room was decorated to the highest standard, and I loved the sense of quirkyness and individuality that came across unlike standardised layouts and sterile environments. Having asked for a cot in the room it…"
November 2011,"Just perfect, an oasis of peace in London","This was our second time at the Hotel 41 and we decided to come back as our first stay had been truly great and romantic. This time we were less busy than the first one and we could enjoy the hotel more and I have to say they can create such an amazing atmosphere that one enjoy almost most being at the hotel than being in the city. Every single member of the staff if always there to help, everyone is kind and caring and they all do their very best to assure you the best possible vacation. Rooms are comfortables and our had a lovely fireplace which was great, I think the best night was when we just stayed in bed sipping hot chocolate and watching a dvd at the fireplace light! We also managed to have a pre dinner cocktail in the lounge every night and have to say the christmas…"
November 2011,Luxurious as ever,"This was my fourth stay at 41 and my first during christmas time, so when I arrived in London, I was excited to see what my ""home away from home"" would look like.  Arriving at the hotel I was greeted by a wonderful christmas decoration around the door, which made me feel comfy the moment I stepped in (even more comfy than normally, which is impressive). I was sleeping in room 4111 this time, and my high expectations (I had slept in one of the suites last time) were instantly fulfilled when I discovered my room had a fireplace. Espescially during christmas time this is a wonderful feature to have in your hotel bedroom.  The room was big, with one window facing to the rear of the hotel in the direction of Victoria station, the other, in the bathroom, towards Buckingham Palace. One…"
November 2011,Wow,"We booked because of travel advisor reviews. On arrival the lady at the lobby greeted us with enthusiasm and explained how the hotel worked. It would be easy to miss the entrance, a discrete door between a restaurant and the Reubens Hotel, but the taxi man knew it - usually a good sign. Three staff attended to us in the executive lounge.  Our room was super with it's own gas fire, comfy bed and bathroom which had a real bath and a separate shower.  We went with the hotel recommendation for dinner an Indian restaurant Quillion which was great.  Later we noticed some faults in the room to do with lighting and tv.  Next morning the hotel fixed these and offered free drinks as an apology - always the test of an establishment, what it does when things go wrong."
November 2011,Completely satisfied with stay,"We stayed at the 41 for over a week and every day was a delight. It is well situated for tourists in particular with Buckingham Palace a 5 minute walk in one direction and Victoria underground and train station about 5 minutes walk in the other direction.  Our room was very comfortable, we stayed in an executive king room and had plenty of space. The bed was so cosy and wonderful, it was hard to get out of some mornings! The room, including the bathroom, was spotlessly cleaned every day. We appreciated the little touches at turndown every evening including restful music and weather information for the next day. We had breakfast included in our rate and afternoon tea during our stay, the breakfasts were delicious and filling and the afternoon tea was fantastic! In particular the…"
November 2011,Sadly disappointed,"I have never stayed in a 5 star hotel with such a small double bed. Our room was small, with a tiny bathroom. The bathroom tiles had been partially patched, leaving an obvious rectangle on the wall where perhaps something had been removed.  On our first night, after asking not to be disturbed, and going to bed early after a long journey, we were woken by reception phoning to check that everything was alright with our room.  We also had a sheet with a small hole in it and a towel that gave way on the edge.  The staff were all very friendly, a bit too friendly for our introverted selves! We couldn't get from our room to the street without saying hello to two or three staff members on the way.  In summary, if friendly, attentive staff, and a cosy atmosphere are what defines a good…"
,"Fantastic Hotel, Great Staff, Wonderful Experience","My wife and I just returned home after 3 great nights spent at Hotel 41.  From the location close to Buckingham Palace, Victoria Tube Station, and many of the have-to-see sights of London to the fantastic service from the 41 staff, you cannot go wrong with this lovely boutique hotel.  Some folks may say it is expensive, but not if you consider the gourmet breakfast, snacks all during the day, and evening hours-dourves.  You need only to find a place to eat lunch while you are out enjoying the sights.  This was our second stay at the 41 and it only re-inforced the wonderful experience we had in 2005. This is a must stay hotel."
